# 4 Synchronisation procedures
## 4.1 Cell search
Cell search is the procedure by which a UE acquires time and frequency
synchronization with a cell and detects the physical layer Cell ID of that
cell. E-UTRA cell search supports a scalable overall transmission bandwidth
corresponding to 6 resource blocks and upwards.
The following signals are transmitted in the downlink to facilitate cell
search: the primary and secondary synchronization signals.
## 4.2 Timing synchronisation
### 4.2.1 Radio link monitoring
The downlink radio link quality of the serving cell shall be monitored by the
UE for the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/in-sync status to higher layers.
In non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE shall every radio
frame assess the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time period
defined in [10], against thresholds (Q~out~ and Q~in~) defined by relevant
tests in [10].
In DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE shall at least once every
DRX period assess the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time
period defined in [10], against thresholds (Q~out~ and Q~in~) defined by
relevant tests in [10].
The physical layer in the UE shall in radio frames where the radio link
quality is assessed indicate out-of-sync to higher layers when the radio link
quality is worse than the threshold Q~out~. When the radio link quality is
better than the threshold Q~in~, the physical layer in the UE shall in radio
frames where the radio link quality is assessed indicate in-sync to higher
layers.
### 4.2.2 Inter-cell synchronisation
No functionality is specified in this section in this release.
### 4.2.3 Transmission timing adjustments
Upon reception of a timing advance command, the UE shall adjust its uplink
transmission timing for PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS. The timing advance command indicates
the change of the uplink timing relative to the current uplink timing as
multiples of 16$T_{s}$. The start timing of the random access preamble is
specified in [3].
In case of random access response, 11-bit timing advance command [8], _T~A~_ ,
indicates _N~TA~_ values by index values of _T~A~_ = 0, 1, 2, ..., 1282, where
an amount of the time alignment is given by _N~TA~_ = _T~A~_ ×16. _N~TA\ ~_ is
defined in [3].
In other cases, 6-bit timing advance command [8], _T~A~_ , indicates
adjustment of the current _N~TA~_ value, _N~TA,old~_ , to the new _N~TA~_
value, _N~TA,new~_ , by index values of _T~A~_ = 0, 1, 2,..., 63, where
_N~TA,new~_ = _N~TA,old~_ \+ (_T~A~_ −31)×16. Here, adjustment of _N~TA~_
value by a positive or a negative amount indicates advancing or delaying the
uplink transmission timing by a given amount respectively.
For a timing advance command received on subframe _n_ , the corresponding
adjustment of the timing shall apply from the beginning of subframe _n+6._
When the UE's uplink PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS transmissions in subframe _n_ and
subframe _n_ +1 are overlapped due to the timing adjustment, the UE shall
transmit complete subframe _n_ and not transmit the overlapped part of
subframe _n_ +1.
If the received downlink timing changes and is not compensated or is only
partly compensated by the uplink timing adjustment without timing advance
command as specified in [10], the UE changes N~TA~ accordingly.
# 5 Power control
Downlink power control determines the energy per resource element (EPRE). The
term resource element energy denotes the energy prior to CP insertion. The
term resource element energy also denotes the average energy taken over all
constellation points for the modulation scheme applied. Uplink power control
determines the average power over a SC-FDMA symbol in which the physical
channel is transmitted.
## 5.1 Uplink power control
Uplink power control controls the transmit power of the different uplink
physical channels.
A cell wide overload indicator (OI) and a High Interference Indicator (HII) to
control UL interference are defined in [9].

## 5.2 Downlink power allocation
The eNodeB determines the downlink transmit energy per resource element.
A UE may assume downlink cell-specific RS EPRE is constant across the downlink
system bandwidth and constant across all subframes until different cell-
specific RS power information is received. The downlink reference-signal EPRE
can be derived from the downlink reference-signal transmit power given by the
parameter _Reference-signal-power_ provided by higher layers. The downlink
reference-signal transmit power is defined as the linear average over the
power contributions (in [W]) of all resource elements that carry cell-specific
reference signals within the operating system bandwidth.
The ratio of PDSCH EPRE to cell-specific RS EPRE among PDSCH REs (not
applicable to PDSCH REs with zero EPRE) for each OFDM symbol is denoted by
either $\rho_{A}$ or $\rho_{B}$according to the OFDM symbol index as given by
Table 5.2-2. In addition,$\rho_{A}$ and $\rho_{B}$are UE-specific.
For a UE in transmission mode 8 when UE-specific RSs are not present in the
PRBs upon which the corresponding PDSCH is mapped or in transmission modes 1
-- 7, the UE may assume that for 16 QAM, 64 QAM, spatial multiplexing with
more than one layer or for PDSCH transmissions associated with the multi-user
MIMO transmission scheme,
  * $\rho_{A}$ is equal to$\delta_{\text{power-offset}} + P_{A} + \text{10}\text{log}_{\text{10}}(2)$ [dB] when the UE receives a PDSCH data transmission using precoding for transmit diversity with 4 cell-specific antenna ports according to Section 6.3.4.3 of [3];
  * $\rho_{A}$ is equal to$\delta_{\text{power-offset}} + P_{A}$ [dB] otherwise
where$\delta_{\text{power-offset}}$is 0 dB for all PDSCH transmission schemes
except multi-user MIMO and where$P_{A}$ is a UE specific parameter provided by
higher layers.
For transmission mode 7, if UE-specific RSs are present in the PRBs upon which
the corresponding PDSCH is mapped, the ratio of PDSCH EPRE to UE-specific RS
EPRE within each OFDM symbol containing UE-specific RSs shall be a constant,
and that constant shall be maintained over all the OFDM symbols containing the
UE-specific RSs in the corresponding PRBs. In addition, the UE may assume that
for 16QAM or 64QAM, this ratio is 0 dB.
For transmission mode 8, if UE-specific RSs are present in the PRBs upon which
the corresponding PDSCH is mapped, the UE may assume the ratio of PDSCH EPRE
to UE-specific RS EPRE within each OFDM symbol containing UE-specific RSs is 0
dB.
A UE may assume that downlink positioning reference signal EPRE is constant
across the positioning reference signal bandwidth and across all OFDM symbols
that contain positioning reference signals in a given positioning reference
signal occasion [10].
The cell-specific ratio $\frac{\rho_{B}}{\rho_{A}}$ is given by Table 5.2-1
according to cell-specific parameter $P_{B}$ signalled by higher layers and
the number of configured eNodeB cell specific antenna ports.

### 5.2.1 eNodeB Relative Narrowband TX Power restrictions
The determination of reported Relative Narrowband TX Power indication
$\text{RNTP}\left( n_{\text{PRB}} \right)$ is defined as follows:
where $E_{A}(n_{\text{PRB}})$ is the maximum intended EPRE of UE-specific
PDSCH REs in OFDM symbols not containing RS in this physical resource block on
antenna port _p_ in the considered future time interval _;_ $n_{\text{PRB}}$
is the physical resource block number $n_{\text{PRB}} =
0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}} - 1$;
$\text{RNTP}_{\text{threshold}}$ takes on one of the following
values$\text{RNTP}_{\text{threshold}} \in \left{ - \infty, - \text{11}, -
\text{10}, - 9, - 8, - 7, - 6, - 5, - 4, - 3, - 2, - 1,0, + 1, + 2, + 3
\right}$[dB] and
where $P_{\text{max}}^{(p)}$ is the base station maximum output power
described in [7], and $\text{Δf}$,
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}$and$N_{\text{SC}}^{\text{RB}}$ are defined in [3].
# 6 Random access procedure
Prior to initiation of the non-synchronized physical random access procedure,
Layer 1 shall receive the following information from the higher layers:
  1. Random access channel parameters (PRACH configuration and frequency position)
  2. Parameters for determining the root sequences and their cyclic shifts in the preamble sequence set for the cell (index to logical root sequence table, cyclic shift ($N_{\text{CS}}$), and set type (unrestricted or restricted set))
## 6.1 Physical non-synchronized random access procedure
From the physical layer perspective, the L1 random access procedure
encompasses the transmission of random access preamble and random access
response. The remaining messages are scheduled for transmission by the higher
layer on the shared data channel and are not considered part of the L1 random
access procedure. A random access channel occupies 6 resource blocks in a
subframe or set of consecutive subframes reserved for random access preamble
transmissions. The eNodeB is not prohibited from scheduling data in the
resource blocks reserved for random access channel preamble transmission.
The following steps are required for the L1 random access procedure:
  1. Layer 1 procedure is triggered upon request of a preamble transmission by higher layers.
  2. A preamble index, a target preamble received power (PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER), a corresponding RA-RNTI and a PRACH resource are indicated by higher layers as part of the request.
  3. A preamble transmission power P~PRACH~ is determined as\ P~PRACH~ = min{$P_{\text{CMAX}}$, PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER + PL}_[dBm], where $P_{\text{CMAX}}$ is the configured UE transmitted power defined in [6] and PL is the downlink pathloss estimate calculated in the UE.
  4. A preamble sequence is selected from the preamble sequence set using the preamble index.
  5. A single preamble is transmitted using the selected preamble sequence with transmission power P~PRACH~ on the indicated PRACH resource.
  6. Detection of a PDCCH with the indicated RA-RNTI is attempted during a window controlled by higher layers (see [8], clause 5.1.4). If detected, the corresponding DL-SCH transport block is passed to higher layers. The higher layers parse the transport block and indicate the 20-bit uplink grant to the physical layer, which is processed according to section 6.2.
### 6.1.1 Timing
For the L1 random access procedure, UE's uplink transmission timing after a
random access preamble transmission is as follows.
a. If a PDCCH with associated RA-RNTI is detected in subframe _n_ , and the
corresponding DL-SCH transport block contains a response to the transmitted
preamble sequence, the UE shall, according to the information in the response,
transmit an UL-SCH transport block in the first subframe $n + k_{1}$, $k_{1}
\geq 6$, if the UL delay field in section 6.2 is set to zero where $n + k_{1}$
is the first available UL subframe for PUSCH transmission. The UE shall
postpone the PUSCH transmission to the next available UL subframe after $n +
k_{1}$ if the field is set to 1.
b. If a random access response is received in subframe _n_ , and the
corresponding DL-SCH transport block does not contain a response to the
transmitted preamble sequence, the UE shall, if requested by higher layers, be
ready to transmit a new preamble sequence no later than in subframe .
c. If no random access response is received in subframe _n_ , _where subframe
n_ is the last subframe of the random access response window, the UE shall, if
requested by higher layers, be ready to transmit a new preamble sequence no
later than in subframe .
In case a random access procedure is initiated by a PDCCH order in subframe
_n_ , the UE shall, if requested by higher layers, transmit random access
preamble in the first subframe , , where a PRACH resource is available.
## 6.2 Random Access Response Grant
The higher layers indicate the 20-bit UL Grant to the physical layer, as
defined in [8]. This is referred to the Random Access Response Grant in the
physical layer. The content of these 20 bits starting with the MSB and ending
with the LSB are as follows:
\- Hopping flag -- 1 bit
\- Fixed size resource block assignment -- 10 bits
\- Truncated modulation and coding scheme -- 4 bits
\- TPC command for scheduled PUSCH -- 3 bits
\- UL delay -- 1 bit
\- CQI request -- 1 bit
The UE shall perform PUSCH frequency hopping if the single bit frequency
hopping (FH) field in a corresponding Random Access Response Grant is set as
1, otherwise no PUSCH frequency hopping is performed. When the hopping flag is
set, the UE shall perform PUSCH hopping as indicated via the fixed size
resource block assignment detailed below,
The fixed size resource block assignment field is interpreted as follows:
if $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}} \leq \text{44}$
> Truncate the fixed size resource block assignment to its _b_ least
> significant bits, where $b = \left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\left(
> \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}} \cdot \left( N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}} + 1
> \right)}{2} \right) \right\rceil$, and interpret the truncated resource
> block assignment according to the rules for a regular DCI format 0
else
> Insert _b_ most significant bits with value set to '0' after the _N~UL_hop~_
> hopping bits in the fixed size resource block assignment, where the number
> of hopping bits _N~UL_hop~_ is zero when the hopping flag bit is not set to
> 1, and is defined in Table 8.4-1 when the hopping flag bit is set to 1, and
> $b = \left( \left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\left( \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}
> \cdot \left( N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}} + 1 \right)}{2} \right) \right\rceil
> - \text{10} \right)$, and interpret the expanded resource block assignment
> according to the rules for a regular DCI format 0
end if
The truncated modulation and coding scheme field is interpreted such that the
modulation and coding scheme corresponding to the Random Access Response grant
is determined from MCS indices 0 through 15 in Table 8.6.1-1.
The TPC command $\delta_{\text{msg}2}$ shall be used for setting the power of
the PUSCH, and is interpreted according to Table 6.2-1.
Table 6.2-1: TPC Command $\delta_{\text{msg}2}$ for Scheduled PUSCH
* * *
TPC Command Value (in dB) 0 -6 1 -4 2 -2 3 0 4 2 5 4 6 6 7 8
* * *
In non-contention based random access procedure, the CQI request field is
interpreted to determine whether an aperiodic CQI, PMI, and RI report is
included in the corresponding PUSCH transmission according to section 7.2.1.
In contention based random access procedure, the CQI request field is
reserved.
The UL delay applies for both TDD and FDD and this field can be set to 0 or 1
to indicate whether the delay of PUSCH is introduced as shown in section
6.1.1.
# 7 Physical downlink shared channel related procedures
For FDD, there shall be a maximum of 8 HARQ processes in the downlink.
For TDD, the maximum number of HARQ processes in the downlink shall be
determined by the UL/DL configuration (Table 4.2-2 of [3]), as indicated in
table 7-1.
The dedicated broadcast HARQ process defined in [8] is not counted as part of
the maximum number of HARQ processes for both FDD and TDD.

## 7.1 UE procedure for receiving the physical downlink shared channel
A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with DCI format 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2, 2A
or 2B intended for the UE in a subframe, decode the corresponding PDSCH in the
same subframe with the restriction of the number of transport blocks defined
in the higher layers.
A UE may assume that positioning reference signals are not present in resource
blocks in which it shall decode PDSCH according to a detected PDCCH with CRC
scrambled by the SI-RNTI or P-RNTI with DCI format 1A or 1C intended for the
UE.
If a UE is configured by higher layers to decode PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
the SI-RNTI, the UE shall decode the PDCCH and the corresponding PDSCH
according to any of the combinations defined in table 7.1-1. The scrambling
initialization of PDSCH corresponding to these PDCCHs is by SI-RNTI.

If a UE is configured by higher layers to decode PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
the RA-RNTI, the UE shall decode the PDCCH and the corresponding PDSCH
according to any of the combinations defined in table 7.1-3. The scrambling
initialization of PDSCH corresponding to these PDCCHs is by RA-RNTI.
When RA-RNTI and either C-RNTI or SPS C-RNTI are assigned in the same
subframe, UE is not required to decode a PDSCH indicated by a PDCCH with a CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI or SPS C-RNTI.

* * *
The UE is semi-statically configured via higher layer signalling to receive
PDSCH data transmissions signalled via PDCCH according to one of eight
transmission modes, denoted mode 1 to mode 8.
For frame structure type 1,
  * the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH resource blocks transmitted on antenna port 5 in any subframe in which the number of OFDM symbols for PDCCH with normal CP is equal to four;
  * the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH resource blocks transmitted on antenna port 5, 7, or 8 in the two PRBs to which a pair of VRBs is mapped if either one of the two PRBs overlaps in frequency with a transmission of either PBCH or primary or secondary synchronisation signals in the same subframe;
    * the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH resource blocks transmitted on antenna port 7 for which distributed VRB resource allocation is assigned.
    * The UE may skip decoding the transport block(s) if it does not receive all assigned PDSCH resource blocks. If the UE skips decoding, the physical layer indicates to higher layer that the transport block(s) are not successfully decoded.
For frame structure type 2,
  * the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH resource blocks transmitted on antenna port 5 in any subframe in which the number of OFDM symbols for PDCCH with normal CP is equal to four;
  * the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH resource blocks transmitted on antenna port 5 in the two PRBs to which a pair of VRBs is mapped if either one of the two PRBs overlaps in frequency with a transmission of PBCH in the same subframe;
  * the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH resource blocks transmitted on antenna port 7 or 8 in the two PRBs to which a pair of VRBs is mapped if either one of the two PRBs overlaps in frequency with a transmission of primary or secondary synchronisation signals in the same subframe;
  * with normal CP configuration, the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH on antenna port 5 for which distributed VRB resource allocation is assigned in the special subframe with configuration #1 or #6;
  * the UE is not expected to receive PDSCH on antenna port 7 for which distributed VRB resource allocation is assigned.
  * The UE may skip decoding the transport block(s) if it does not receive all assigned PDSCH resource blocks. If the UE skips decoding, the physical layer indicates to higher layer that the transport block(s) are not successfully decoded.
If a UE is configured by higher layers to decode PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
the C-RNTI, the UE shall decode the PDCCH and any corresponding PDSCH
according to the respective combinations defined in table 7.1-5. The
scrambling initialization of PDSCH corresponding to these PDCCHs is by C-RNTI.
When a UE configured in transmission mode 3, 4 or 8 receives a DCI Format 1A
assignment, it shall assume that the PDSCH transmission is associated with
transport block 1 and that transport block 2 is disabled.
When a UE is configured in transmission mode 7, scrambling initialization of
UE-specific reference signals corresponding to these PDCCHs is by C-RNTI.
The UE does not support transmission mode 8 if extended cyclic prefix is used
in the downlink.

If a UE is configured by higher layers to decode PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
the SPS C-RNTI, the UE shall decode the PDCCH and any corresponding PDSCH
according to the respective combinations defined in table 7.1-6. The same
PDSCH related configuration applies in the case that a PDSCH is transmitted
without a corresponding PDCCH. The scrambling initialization of PDSCH
corresponding to these PDCCHs and PDSCH without a corresponding PDCCH is by
SPS C-RNTI.
When a UE is configured in transmission mode 7, scrambling initialization of
UE-specific reference signals corresponding to these PDCCHs is by SPS C-RNTI.

If a UE is configured by higher layers to decode PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
the Temporary C-RNTI and is not configured to decode PDCCH with CRC scrambled
by the C-RNTI, the UE shall decode the PDCCH and the corresponding PDSCH
according to the combination defined in table 7.1-7. The scrambling
initialization of PDSCH corresponding to these PDCCHs is by Temporary C-RNTI.

The transmission schemes of the PDSCH are described in the following sub-
clauses.
### 7.1.1 Single-antenna port scheme
For the single-antenna port transmission schemes (port 0, port 5, port 7 or
port 8) of the PDSCH, the UE may assume that an eNB transmission on the PDSCH
would be performed according to Section 6.3.4.1 of [3].
In case an antenna port $p \in \left{ 7,8 \right}$ is used, the UE cannot
assume that the other antenna port in the set $\left{ 7,8 \right}$is not
associated with transmission of PDSCH to another UE.
### 7.1.2 Transmit diversity scheme
For the transmit diversity transmission scheme of the PDSCH, the UE may assume
that an eNB transmission on the PDSCH would be performed according to Section
6.3.4.3 of [3]
### 7.1.3 Large delay CDD scheme
For the large delay CDD transmission scheme of the PDSCH, the UE may assume
that an eNB transmission on the PDSCH would be performed according to large
delay CDD as defined in Section 6.3.4.2.2 of [3].
### 7.1.4 Closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme
For the closed-loop spatial multiplexing transmission scheme of the PDSCH, the
UE may assume that an eNB transmission on the PDSCH would be performed
according to the applicable number of transmission layers as defined in
Section 6.3.4.2.1 of [3].
### 7.1.5 Multi-user MIMO scheme
For the multi-user MIMO transmission scheme of the PDSCH, the UE may assume
that an eNB transmission on the PDSCH would be performed on one layer and
according to Section 6.3.4.2.1 of [3]. The $\delta_{\text{power-offset}}$dB
value signalled on PDCCH with DCI format 1D using the downlink power offset
field is given in Table 7.1.5-1.

### 7.1.5A Dual layer scheme
For the dual layer transmission scheme of the PDSCH, the UE may assume that an
eNB transmission on the PDSCH would be performed with two transmission layers
on antenna ports 7 and 8 as defined in Section 6.3.4.4 of [3].
### 7.1.6 Resource allocation
The UE shall interpret the resource allocation field depending on the PDCCH
DCI format detected. A resource allocation field in each PDCCH includes two
parts, a resource allocation header field and information consisting of the
actual resource block assignment. PDCCH DCI formats 1, 2, 2A and 2B with type
0 and PDCCH DCI formats 1, 2, 2A and 2B with type 1 resource allocation have
the same format and are distinguished from each other via the single bit
resource allocation header field which exists depending on the downlink system
bandwidth (section 5.3.3.1 of [4]), where type 0 is indicated by 0 value and
type 1 is indicated otherwise. PDCCH with DCI format 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D have a
type 2 resource allocation while PDCCH with DCI format 1, 2, 2A and 2B have
type 0 or type 1 resource allocation. PDCCH DCI formats with a type 2 resource
allocation do not have a resource allocation header field.
A UE shall discard PDSCH resource allocation in the corresponding PDCCH if
consistent control information is not detected.
#### 7.1.6.1 Resource allocation type 0
In resource allocations of type 0, resource block assignment information
includes a bitmap indicating the resource block groups (RBGs) that are
allocated to the scheduled UE where a RBG is a set of consecutive virtual
resource blocks (VRBs) of localized type as defined in section 6.2.3.1 of [3].
Resource block group size (_P_) is a function of the system bandwidth as shown
in Table 7.1.6.1-1. The total number of RBGs ($N_{\text{RBG}}$) for downlink
system bandwidth of$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}$ is given by $N_{\text{RBG}} =
\left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{P} \right\rceil$where
$\left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{P} \right\rfloor$of the RBGs
are of size P and if $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}\text{mod}P > 0$ then one of
the RBGs is of size$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}} - P \cdot \left\lfloor
\frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{P} \right\rfloor$. The bitmap is of size
$N_{\text{RBG}}$bits with one bitmap bit per RBG such that each RBG is
addressable. The RBGs shall be indexed in the order of increasing frequency
and non-increasing RBG sizes starting at the lowest frequency. The order of
RBG to bitmap bit mapping is in such way that RBG 0 to RBG$N_{\text{RBG}} - 1$
are mapped to MSB to LSB of the bitmap. The RBG is allocated to the UE if the
corresponding bit value in the bitmap is 1, the RBG is not allocated to the UE
otherwise.

#### 7.1.6.2 Resource allocation type 1
In resource allocations of type 1, a resource block assignment information of
size $N_{\text{RBG}}$ indicates to a scheduled UE the VRBs from the set of
VRBs from one of _P_ RBG subsets. The virtual resource blocks used are of
localized type as defined in section 6.2.3.1 of [3]. Also _P_ is the RBG size
associated with the system bandwidth as shown in Table 7.1.6.1-1. A RBG subset
$p$, where $0 \leq p  if the transport block is transmitted in DwPTS of the special subframe in
> frame structure type 2, then
>
> set the Table 7.1.7.2.1-1 column indicator ,
>
> else, set the Table 7.1.7.2.1-1 column indicator $N_{\text{PRB}} =
> N_{\text{PRB}}^{'}$.
The UE may skip decoding a transport block in an initial transmission if the
effective channel code rate is higher than 0.930, where the effective channel
code rate is defined as the number of downlink information bits (including CRC
bits) divided by the number of physical channel bits on PDSCH. If the UE skips
decoding, the physical layer indicates to higher layer that the transport
block is not successfully decoded. For the special subframe configurations 0
and 5 with normal downlink CP or configurations 0 and 4 with extended downlink
CP, shown in table 4.2-1 [3], there shall be no PDSCH transmission in DwPTS of
the special subframe.
#### 7.1.7.1 Modulation order determination
The UE shall use $Q_{m}$**= 2** if the DCI CRC is scrambled by P-RNTI, RA-
RNTI, or SI-RNTI, otherwise, the UE shall use$I_{\text{MCS}}$and Table
7.1.7.1-1 to determine the modulation order ($Q_{m}$) used in the physical
downlink shared channel.

#### 7.1.7.2 Transport block size determination
If the DCI CRC is scrambled by P-RNTI, RA-RNTI, or SI-RNTI then
  * for DCI format 1A:
    * the UE shall set the TBS index ($I_{\text{TBS}}$) equal to $I_{\text{MCS}}$ and determine its TBS by the procedure in Section 7.1.7.2.1.
  * for DCI format 1C:
    * the UE shall set the TBS index ($I_{\text{TBS}}$) equal to $I_{\text{MCS}}$ and determine its TBS from Table 7.1.7.2.3-1.
else
  * for$0 \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{28}$, the UE shall first determine the TBS index ($I_{\text{TBS}}$) using$I_{\text{MCS}}$and Table 7.1.7.1-1 except if the transport block is disabled in DCI formats 2, 2A and 2B as specified below. For a transport block that is not mapped to two-layer spatial multiplexing, the TBS is determined by the procedure in Section 7.1.7.2.1. For a transport block that is mapped to two-layer spatial multiplexing, the TBS is determined by the procedure in Section 7.1.7.2.2.
  * for$\text{29} \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{31}$, the TBS is assumed to be as determined from DCI transported in the latest PDCCH for the same transport block using $0 \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{28}$. If there is no PDCCH for the same transport block using$0 \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{28}$, and if the initial PDSCH for the same transport block is semi-persistently scheduled, the TBS shall be determined from the most recent semi-persistent scheduling assignment PDCCH.
  * In DCI formats 2, 2A and 2B a transport block is disabled if $I_{\text{MCS}} = 0$ and if _rv~idx~_ = 1 otherwise the transport block is enabled.
The NDI and HARQ process ID, as signalled on PDCCH, and the TBS, as determined
above, shall be delivered to higher layers.
#### 7.1.7.2.1 Transport blocks not mapped to two-layer spatial multiplexing
For$1 \leq N_{\text{PRB}} \leq \text{110}$, the TBS is given by the
($I_{\text{TBS}}$,$N_{\text{PRB}}$) entry of Table 7.1.7.2.1-1.

## 7.2 UE procedure for reporting channel quality indication (CQI), precoding
matrix indicator (PMI) and rank indication (RI)
The time and frequency resources that can be used by the UE to report CQI,
PMI, and RI are controlled by the eNB. For spatial multiplexing, as given in
[3], the UE shall determine a RI corresponding to the number of useful
transmission layers. For transmit diversity as given in [3], RI is equal to
one.
A UE in transmission mode 8 is configured with PMI/RI reporting if the
parameter _pmi-RI-Report_ is configured by higher layer signalling; otherwise,
it is configured without PMI/RI reporting.
CQI, PMI, and RI reporting is periodic or aperiodic.
A UE shall transmit periodic CQI/PMI, or RI reporting on PUCCH as defined
hereafter in subframes with no PUSCH allocation. A UE shall transmit periodic
CQI/PMI or RI reporting on PUSCH as defined hereafter in subframes with PUSCH
allocation, where the UE shall use the same PUCCH-based periodic CQI/PMI or RI
reporting format on PUSCH.
A UE shall transmit aperiodic CQI/PMI, and RI reporting on PUSCH if the
conditions specified hereafter are met. For aperiodic CQI reporting, RI
reporting is transmitted only if configured CQI/PMI/RI feedback type supports
RI reporting.
The CQI transmissions on PUCCH and PUSCH for various scheduling modes are
summarized in the following table:
Table 7.2-1: Physical Channels for Aperiodic or Periodic CQI reporting
* * *
Scheduling Mode Periodic CQI reporting channels Aperiodic CQI reporting
channel Frequency non-selective PUCCH  
Frequency selective PUCCH PUSCH
* * *
In case both periodic and aperiodic reporting would occur in the same
subframe, the UE shall only transmit the aperiodic report in that subframe.
When reporting RI the UE reports a single instance of the number of useful
transmission layers. For each RI reporting interval when the UE is configured
in transmission mode 4 or when the UE is configured in transmission mode 8
with PMI/RI reporting, a UE shall determine a RI from the supported set of RI
values for the corresponding eNodeB antenna configuration and UE category and
report the number in each RI report. For each RI reporting interval when the
UE is configured in transmission mode 3, a UE shall determine RI for the
corresponding eNodeB antenna configuration and UE category in each reporting
interval and report the detected number in each RI report to support selection
between transmit diversity and large delay CDD.
When reporting PMI the UE reports either a single or a multiple PMI report.
The number of RBs represented by a single UE PMI report can be
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}$ or a smaller subset of RBs. The number of RBs
represented by a single PMI report is semi-statically configured by higher
layer signalling. A UE is restricted to report PMI and RI within a precoder
codebook subset specified by a bitmap parameter _codebookSubsetRestriction_
configured by higher layer signalling. For a specific precoder codebook and
associated transmission mode, the bitmap can specify all possible precoder
codebook subsets from which the UE can assume the eNB may be using when the UE
is configured in the relevant transmission mode. Codebook subset restriction
is supported for transmission modes 3, 4, 5, 6 and for transmission mode 8 if
the UE is configured with PMI/RI reporting. The resulting number of bits for
each transmission mode is given in Table 7.2-1b. The bitmap forms the bit
sequence $a_{A_{c} - 1},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{3},a_{2},a_{1},a_{0}$where
$a_{0}$ is the LSB and $a_{A_{c} - 1}$is the MSB and where a bit value of zero
indicates that the PMI and RI reporting is not allowed to correspond to
precoder(s) associated with the bit. The association of bits to precoders for
the relevant transmission modes are given as follows:
  1. Transmission mode 3
a. 2 antenna ports: bit $a_{\upsilon - 1},\ \upsilon = 2$is associated with
the precoder in Table 6.3.4.2.3-1 of [3] corresponding to $\upsilon$ layers
and codebook index 0 while bit $a_{0}$ is associated with the precoder for 2
antenna ports in Section 6.3.4.3 of [3].
b. 4 antenna ports: bit $a_{\upsilon - 1},\ \upsilon = 2,3,4$is associated
with the precoders in Table 6.3.4.2.3-2 of [3] corresponding to $\upsilon$
layers and codebook indices 12, 13, 14, and 15 while bit $a_{0}$ is associated
with the precoder for 4 antenna ports in Section 6.3.4.3 of [3].
  2. Transmission mode 4
a. 2 antenna ports: see Table 7.2-1c
b. 4 antenna ports: bit $a_{\text{16}(\upsilon - 1) + i_{c}}$ is associated
with the precoder for $\upsilon$ layers and with codebook index $i_{c}$in
Table 6.3.4.2.3-2 of [3].
  3. Transmission modes 5 and 6
a. 2 antenna ports: bit $a_{i_{c}}$ is associated with the precoder for

### 7.2.1 Aperiodic CQI/PMI/RI Reporting using PUSCH
A UE shall perform aperiodic CQI, PMI and RI reporting using the PUSCH in
subframe _n+k_ , upon receiving in subframe _n_ either:
  * a DCI format 0, or
  * a Random Access Response Grant,
if the respective CQI request field is set to 1 and is not reserved.
When the CQI request field from a DCI format 0 is set to 1, for FDD _k=4_ ,
and for TDD UL/DL configuration 1-6, _k_ is given in Table 8-2. For TDD UL/DL
configuration 0, if the MSB of the UL index is set to 1 and LSB of the UL
index is set to 0, _k_ is given in Table 8-2; or if MSB of the UL index is set
to 0 and LSB of the UL index is set to 1, _k_ is equal to 7; or if both MSB
and LSB of the UL index is set to 1, _k_ is given in Table 8-2.
When the CQI request field from a Random Access Response Grant is set to 1 and
is not reserved, _k_ is equal to $k_{1}$ if the UL delay field in section 6.2
is set to zero, where $k_{1}$ is given in section 6.1.1. The UE shall postpone
aperiodic CQI, PMI and RI reporting to the next available UL subframe if the
UL delay field is set to 1.
The minimum reporting interval for aperiodic reporting of CQI and PMI and RI
is 1 subframe. _The subband size for CQI shall be the same for transmitter-
receiver configurations with and without precoding._
_When aperiodic CQI/PMI/RI report with no transport block associated as
defined in section 8.6.2 and positive SR is transmitted in the same subframe,
the UE shall transmit SR, and, if applicable, ACK/NAK, on PUCCH resources as
described in Section 10.1_
A UE is semi-statically configured by higher layers to feed back CQI and PMI
and corresponding RI on the same PUSCH using one of the following reporting
modes given in Table 7.2.1-1 and described below.

ReportModeAperiodic_ which is configured by higher-layer signalling.
For $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}} \leq 7$, PUSCH reporting modes are not
supported.
RI is only reported for transmission mode 3, transmission mode 4, and
transmission mode 8 if the UE is configured with PMI/RI reporting.

### 7.2.2 Periodic CQI/PMI/RI Reporting using PUCCH
A UE is semi-statically configured by higher layers to periodically feed back
different CQI, PMI, and RI on the PUCCH using the reporting modes given in
Table 7.2.2-1 and described below.

                                **(subband CQI)**
* * *
For each of the transmission modes defined in Section 7.1, the following
reporting modes are supported on PUCCH:
> Transmission mode 1 : Modes 1-0, 2-0
>
> Transmission mode 2 : Modes 1-0, 2-0
>
> Transmission mode 3 : Modes 1-0, 2-0

>
> Transmission mode 8 : Modes 1-1, 2-1 if the UE is configured with PMI/RI
> reporting; modes 1-0, 2-0 if the UE is configured without PMI/RI reporting
The periodic CQI reporting mode is given by the parameter _cqi-
FormatIndicatorPeriodic_ which is configured by higher-layer signalling.
For the UE-selected subband CQI, a CQI report in a certain subframe describes
the channel quality in a particular part or in particular parts of the
bandwidth described subsequently as bandwidth part (BP) or parts. The
bandwidth parts shall be indexed in the order of increasing frequency and non-
increasing sizes starting at the lowest frequency.
  * There are a total of _N_ subbands for a system bandwidth given by$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}$ where$\left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{k} \right\rfloor$subbands are of size _k._ If $\left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{k} \right\rceil - \left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{k} \right\rfloor > 0$ then one of the subbands is of size$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}} - k \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{k} \right\rfloor$.
  * A bandwidth part _j_ is frequency-consecutive and consists of $N_{j}$subbands where _J_ bandwidth parts span _S_ or $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}$ as given in Table 7.2.2-2. If then $N_{j}$ is$\left\lceil \frac{\frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{k}}{J} \right\rceil$. If _J >1_ then $N_{j}$ is either $\left\lceil \frac{\frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{k}}{J} \right\rceil$ or $\left\lceil \frac{\frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}}{k}}{J} \right\rceil - 1$, depending on$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}$, _k_ and _J_.
  * Each bandwidth part _j_ , where 0 ≤ _j_ ≤ _J_ -1, is scanned in sequential order according to increasing frequency.
  * For UE selected subband feedback a single subband out of $N_{j}$ subbands of a bandwidth part is selected along with a corresponding _L_ -bit label indexed in the order of increasing frequency, where.
The CQI and PMI payload sizes of each PUCCH reporting mode are given in Table
7.2.2-3.
Four CQI/PMI and RI reporting types with distinct periods and offsets are
supported for each PUCCH reporting mode as given in Table 7.2.2-3:
  * Type 1 report supports CQI feedback for the UE selected sub-bands
  * Type 2 report supports wideband CQI and PMI feedback.
  * Type 3 report supports RI feedback
  * Type 4 report supports wideband CQI
The periodicity (in subframes) and offset (in subframes) for CQI/PMI reporting
are determined based on the parameter _cqi-pmi-ConfigIndex_ () given in Table
7.2.2-1A for FDD and table 7.2.2-1C for TDD. The periodicity and relative
offset for RI reporting are determined based on the parameter _ri-ConfigIndex_
() given in Table 7.2.2-1B. Both _cqi-pmi-ConfigIndex_ and _ri-ConfigIndex_
are configured by higher layer signalling. The relative reporting offset for
RI takes values from the set
In the case where wideband CQI/PMI reporting is configured:
  * The reporting instances for wideband CQI/PMI are subframes satisfying _._
  * In case RI reporting is configured, the reporting interval of the RI reporting is an integer multiple of period (in subframes).
    * The reporting instances for RI are subframes satisfying $\left( \text{10} \times n_{f} + \left\lfloor \frac{n_{s}}{2} \right\rfloor - N_{\text{OFFSET},\text{CQI}} - N_{\text{OFFSET},\text{RI}} \right)\text{mod}\left( N_{P} \cdot M_{\text{RI}} \right) = 0$.
    * In case of collision of RI and wideband CQI/PMI the wideband CQI/PMI is dropped.
In the case where both wideband CQI/PMI and subband CQI reporting are
configured:
  * The reporting instances for wideband CQI/PMI and subband CQI are subframes satisfying $\left( \text{10} \times n_{f} + \left\lfloor \frac{n_{s}}{2} \right\rfloor - N_{\text{OFFSET},\text{CQI}} \right)\text{mod}N_{P} = 0$.
    * The wideband CQI/PMI report has period , and is reported on the subframes satisfying $\left( \text{10} \times n_{f} + \left\lfloor \frac{n_{s}}{2} \right\rfloor - N_{\text{OFFSET},\text{CQI}} \right)\text{mod}\left( H \cdot N_{P} \right) = 0$. The integer is defined as , where is the number of bandwidth parts.
    * Between every two consecutive wideband CQI/PMI reports, the remaining reporting instances are used in sequence for subband CQI reports on full cycles of bandwidth parts except when the gap between two consecutive wideband CQI/PMI reports contains less than reporting instances due to a system frame number transition to 0, in which case the UE shall not transmit the remainder of the subband CQI reports which have not been transmitted before the second of the two wideband CQI/PMI reports. Each full cycle of bandwidth parts shall be in increasing order starting from bandwidth part 0 to bandwidth part . The parameter is configured by higher-layer signalling.
```{=html}
``` \- In case RI reporting is configured, the reporting interval of RI is
times the wideband CQI/PMI period , and RI is reported on the same PUCCH
cyclic shift resource as both the wideband CQI/PMI and subband CQI reports.
    -   The reporting instances for RI are subframes satisfying
        > $\left( \text{10} \times n_{f} + \left\lfloor \frac{n_{s}}{2} \right\rfloor - N_{\text{OFFSET},\text{CQI}} - N_{\text{OFFSET},\text{RI}} \right)\text{mod}\left( H \cdot N_{P} \cdot M_{\text{RI}} \right) = 0$.In
        > case of collision between RI and wideband CQI/PMI or subband
        > CQI, the wideband CQI/PMI or subband CQI is dropped.
See section 10.1 regarding UE behaviour for collision between CQI/PMI/RI and
ACK/NACK and the corresponding PUCCH format assignment.
The CQI/PMI or RI report shall be transmitted on the PUCCH resource
$n_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(2)}$ as defined in [3], where $n_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(2)}$ is
UE specific and configured by higher layers.
In case of collision between CQI/PMI/RI and positive SR in a same subframe,
CQI/PMI/RI is dropped.

### 7.2.3 Channel quality indicator (CQI) definition
_The CQI indices and their interpretations are given in Table 7.2.3-1._
Based on an unrestricted observation interval in time and frequency, the UE
shall derive for each CQI value reported in uplink subframe _n_ the highest
CQI index between 1 and 15 in Table 7.2.3-1 which satisfies the following
condition, or CQI index 0 if CQI index 1 does not satisfy the condition:
  * A single PDSCH transport block with a combination of modulation scheme and transport block size corresponding to the CQI index, and occupying a group of downlink physical resource blocks termed the CQI reference resource, could be received with a transport block error probability not exceeding 0.1.
A combination of modulation scheme and transport block size corresponds to a
CQI index if:
  * the combination could be signalled for transmission on the PDSCH in the CQI reference resource according to the relevant Transport Block Size table, and
  * the modulation scheme is indicated by the CQI index, and
  * the combination of transport block size and modulation scheme when applied to the reference resource results in the effective channel code rate which is the closest possible to the code rate indicated by the CQI index. If more than one combination of transport block size and modulation scheme results in a effective channel code rate equally close to the code rate indicated by the CQI index, only the combination with the smallest of such transport block sizes is relevant.
The CQI reference resource is defined as follows:
  * In the frequency domain, the CQI reference resource is defined by the group of downlink physical resource blocks corresponding to the band to which the derived CQI value relates.
  * In the time domain, the CQI reference resource is defined by a single downlink subframe _n_ -_n~CQI_ref~_ ,
    * where for periodic CQI reporting _n~CQI_ref~_ is the smallest value greater than or equal to 4, such that it corresponds to a valid downlink subframe;
    * where for aperiodic CQI reporting _n~CQI_ref~_ is such that the reference resource is in the same valid downlink subframe as the corresponding CQI request in a DCI format 0.
    * where for aperiodic CQI reporting _n~CQI_ref~_ is equal to 4 and downlink subframe _n_ -_n~CQI_ref~_ corresponds to a valid downlink subframe, where downlink subframe _n_ -_n~CQI_ref~ is_ received after the subframe with the corresponding CQI request in a Random Access Response Grant.
A downlink subframe shall be considered to be valid if:
      * it is configured as a downlink subframe for that UE, and
      * it is not an MBSFN subframe, and
      * it does not contain a DwPTS field in case the length of DwPTS is $\text{7680} \cdot T_{s}$ and less, and
      * it does not fall within a configured measurement gap for that UE.
If there is no valid downlink subframe for the CQI reference resource, CQI
reporting is omitted in uplink subframe _n_.
  * In the layer domain, the CQI reference resource is defined by any RI and PMI on which the CQI is conditioned.
_In the CQI reference resource, the UE shall assume the following for the
purpose of deriving the CQI index:_
  * _The first 3 OFDM symbols are occupied by control signalling_
  * _No resource elements used by primary or secondary synchronisation signals or PBCH_
  * _CP length of the non-MBSFN subframes_
  * _Redundancy Version 0_
```{=html}
``` \- _the PDSCH transmission scheme given by Table 7.2.3-0 depending on the
transmission mode currently configured for the UE (which may be the default
mode)._
  * The ratio of PDSCH EPRE to cell-specific RS EPRE is as given in Section 5.2 with the exception of $\rho_{A}$which shall be assumed to be
    * $\rho_{A} = P_{A} + \Delta_{\text{offset}} + \text{10}\text{log}_{\text{10}}(2)$[dB] for any modulation scheme, if the UE is configured with transmission mode 2 with 4 cell-specific antenna ports, or transmission mode 3 with 4 cell-specific antenna ports and the associated RI is equal to one;
    * $\rho_{A} = P_{A} + \Delta_{\text{offset}}$[dB] for any modulation scheme and any number of layers, otherwise.
> The shift $\Delta_{\text{offset}}$is given by the parameter _nomPDSCH-RS-
> EPRE-Offset_ which is configured by higher-layer signalling.

### 7.2.4 Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) definition
For transmission modes 4, 5, and 6, precoding feedback is used for channel
dependent codebook based precoding and relies on UEs reporting precoding
matrix indicator (PMI). For transmission mode 8, the UE shall report PMI if
configured with PMI/RI reporting. A UE shall report PMI based on the feedback
modes described in 7.2.1 and 7.2.2. Each PMI value corresponds to a codebook
index given in Table 6.3.4.2.3-1 or Table 6.3.4.2.3-2 of [3] as follows:
  * For 2 antenna ports $\left{ 0,1 \right}$ and an associated RI value of 1, a PMI value of $n \in \left{ 0,1,2,3 \right}$ corresponds to the codebook index $n$ given in Table 6.3.4.2.3-1 of [3] with $\upsilon = 1$.
  * For 2 antenna ports $\left{ 0,1 \right}$ and an associated RI value of 2, a PMI value of $n \in \left{ 0,1 \right}$ corresponds to the codebook index $n + 1$given in Table 6.3.4.2.3-1 of [3] with $\upsilon = 2$.
  * For 4 antenna ports $\left{ 0,1,2,3 \right}$, a PMI value of $n \in \left{ 0,1,\cdots,\text{15} \right}$ corresponds to the codebook index $n$ given in Table 6.3.4.2.3-2 of [3] with $\upsilon$ equal to the associated RI value.
For other transmission modes, PMI reporting is not supported.
## 7.3 UE procedure for reporting ACK/NACK
For FDD, when both ACK/NACK and SR are transmitted in the same sub-frame a UE
shall transmit the ACK/NACK on its assigned ACK/NACK PUCCH resource for a
negative SR transmission and transmit the ACK/NACK on its assigned SR PUCCH
resource for a positive SR transmission.
For TDD and all UL-DL configurations except configuration 5, two ACK/NACK
feedback modes are supported by higher layer configuration.
  * ACK/NACK bundling, and
  * ACK/NACK multiplexing
For TDD UL-DL configuration 5, only ACK/NACK bundling is supported.
For TDD, the UE shall upon detection of a PDSCH transmission or a PDCCH
indicating downlink SPS release (defined in section 9.2) within subframe(s) $n
- k$, where $k \in K$ and $K$ is defined in Table 10.1-1 intended for the UE
and for which ACK/NACK response shall be provided, transmit the ACK/NACK
response in UL subframe _n_.
For TDD UL-DL configurations 1-6, the value of the Downlink Assignment Index
(DAI) in DCI format 0, $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$, detected by the UE
according to Table 7.3-X in subframe $n - k'$, where $k'$ is defined in Table
7.3-Y, represents the total number of subframes with PDSCH transmissions and
with PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release to the corresponding UE within all
the subframe(s)$n - k$, where$k \in K$. The value $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$
includes all PDSCH transmission with and without corresponding PDCCH within
all the subframe(s) $n - k$. In case neither PDSCH transmission, nor PDCCH
indicating the downlink SPS resource release is intended to the UE, the UE can
expect that the value of the DAI in DCI format 0,
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$, if transmitted, is set to 4.
For TDD UL-DL configurations 1-6, the value of the DAI in DCI format
1/1A/1B/1D/2/2A/2B denotes the accumulative number of PDCCH(s) with assigned
PDSCH transmission(s) and PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release up to the
present subframe within subframe(s) $n - k$, where $k \in K$, and shall be
updated from subframe to subframe. Denote $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{DL}}$ as the
value of the DAI in PDCCH with DCI format 1/1A/1B/1D/2/2A/2B detected by the
UE according to Table 7.3-X in subframe$n - k_{m}$, where $k_{m}$ is the
smallest value in the set $K$ (defined in Table 10.1-1) such that the UE
detects a DCI format 1/1A/1B/1D/2/2A/2B.
For all TDD UL-DL configurations, denote $U_{\text{DAI}}$ as the total number
of PDCCH(s) with assigned PDSCH transmission(s) and PDCCH indicating downlink
SPS release detected by the UE within the subframe(s) $n - k$, where $k \in
K$. Denote $N_{\text{SPS}}$, which can be zero or one, as the number of PDSCH
transmissions without a corresponding PDCCH within the subframe(s) $n - k$,
where $k \in K$.
For TDD ACK/NACK bundling or ACK/NACK multiplexing and a subframe $n$ with $M
= 1$, the UE shall generate one or two ACK/NACK bits by performing a logical
AND operation per codeword across $M$ DL subframes associated with a single UL
subframe, of all the corresponding $U_{\text{DAI}} + N_{\text{SPS}}$
individual PDSCH transmission ACK/NACKs and individual ACK in response to
received PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release, where $M$ is the number of
elements in the set $K$ defined in Table 10.1-1. The UE shall detect if at
least one downlink assignment has been missed, and for the case that the UE is
transmitting on PUSCH the UE shall also determine the
parameter$N_{\text{bundled}}$. For TDD UL-DL configuration 0,
$N_{\text{bundled}}$ shall be 1 if UE detects the PDSCH transmission with or
without corresponding PDCCH within the subframe $n - k$, where $k \in K$.
  * For the case that the UE is not transmitting on PUSCH in subframe _n_ and TDD UL-DL configurations 1-6, if $U_{\text{DAI}} > 0$ and $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{DL}} \neq \left( U_{\text{DAI}} - 1 \right)\text{mod}4 + 1$, the UE detects that at least one downlink assignment has been missed.
  * For the case that the UE is transmitting on PUSCH and the PUSCH transmission is adjusted based on a detected PDCCH with DCI format 0 intended for the UE and TDD UL-DL configurations 1-6, if $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}} \neq \left( U_{\text{DAI}} + N_{\text{SPS}} - 1 \right)\text{mod}4 + 1$ the UE detects that at least one downlink assignment has been missed and the UE shall generate NACK for all codewords where $N_{\text{bundled}}$ is determined by the UE as $N_{\text{bundled}} = V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}} + 2$. If the UE does not detect any downlink assignment missing, $N_{\text{bundled}}$ is determined by the UE as $N_{\text{bundled}} = V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$. UE shall not transmit ACK/NACK if $U_{\text{DAI}} + N_{\text{SPS}} = 0$and $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$.
  * For the case that the UE is transmitting on PUSCH, and the PUSCH transmission is not based on a detected PDCCH with DCI format 0 intended for the UE and TDD UL-DL configurations 1-6, if $U_{\text{DAI}} > 0$ and $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{DL}} \neq \left( U_{\text{DAI}} - 1 \right)\text{mod}4 + 1$, the UE detects that at least one downlink assignment has been missed and the UE shall generate NACK for all codewords. The UE determines $N_{\text{bundled}} = (U_{\text{DAI}} + N_{\text{SPS}})$ as the number of assigned subframes. The UE shall not transmit ACK/NACK if $U_{\text{DAI}} + N_{\text{SPS}} = 0$.
For TDD ACK/NACK bundling, when the UE is configured by transmission mode 3, 4
or 8 defined in Section 7.1 and ACK/NACK bits are transmitted on PUSCH, the UE
shall always generate 2 ACK/NACK bits assuming both codeword 0 and 1 are
enabled. For the case that the UE detects only the PDSCH transmission
associated with codeword 0 within the bundled subframes, the UE shall generate
NACK for codeword 1.

For TDD ACK/NACK multiplexing and a subframe $n$with $M > 1$, spatial ACK/NACK
bundling across multiple codewords within a DL subframe is performed by a
logical AND operation of all the corresponding individual ACK/NACKs. In case
the UE is transmitting on PUSCH, the UE shall determine the number of ACK/NAK
feedback bits $O^{\text{ACK}}$ and the ACK/NACK feedback bits
$o_{n}^{\text{ACK}}$ , $n = 0,\ldots,O^{\text{ACK}} - 1$ to be transmitted in
subframe _n_ in case the UE is transmitting on PUSCH.
  * If the PUSCH transmission is adjusted based on a detected PDCCH with DCI format 0 intended for the UE, then $O^{\text{ACK}} = V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ unless $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$ and $U_{\text{DAI}} + N_{\text{SPS}} = 0$ in which case the UE shall not transmit ACK/NACK. The spatially bundled ACK/NACK for a PDSCH transmission with a corresponding PDCCH or for a PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release in subframe $n - k$ is associated with $o_{\text{DAI}(k) - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ where _DAI(k)_ is the value of DAI in DCI format 1A/1B/1D/1/2/2A/2B detected in subframe $n - k$. For the case with $N_{\text{SPS}} > 0$, the ACK/NACK associated with a PDSCH transmission without a corresponding PDCCH is mapped to $o_{O^{\text{ACK}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$. The ACK/NACK feedback bits without any detected PDSCH transmission or without detected PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release are set to NACK.
  * If the PUSCH transmission is not adjusted based on a detected PDCCH with DCI format 0 intended for the UE, $O^{\text{ACK}} = M$, and $o_{i}^{\text{ACK}}$ is associated with the spatially bundled ACK/NACK for DL subframe $n - k_{i}$, where$k_{i} \in K$. The ACK/NACK feedback bits without any detected PDSCH transmission or without detected PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release are set to NACK. The UE shall not transmit ACK/NACK if $U_{\text{DAI}} + N_{\text{SPS}} = 0$.
For TDD when both ACK/NACK and SR are transmitted in the same sub-frame, a UE
shall transmit the bundled ACK/NACK or the multiple ACK/NAK responses
(according to section 10.1) on its assigned ACK/NACK PUCCH resources for a
negative SR transmission. For a positive SR, the UE shall transmit $b(0),b(1)$
on its assigned SR PUCCH resource using PUCCH format 1b according to section
5.4.1 in [3]. The value of $b(0),b(1)$ are generated according to Table 7.3-1
from the $U_{\text{DAI}} + N_{\text{SPS}}$ ACK/NACK responses including ACK in
response to PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release by spatial ACK/NAK bundling
across multiple codewords within each PDSCH transmission. For TDD UL-DL
configurations 1-6, if $U_{\text{DAI}} > 0$ and $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{DL}}
\neq \left( U_{\text{DAI}} - 1 \right)\text{mod}4 + 1$, the UE detects that at
least one downlink assignment has been missed.

For TDD when both ACK/NACK and CQI/PMI or RI are configured to be transmitted
in the same sub-frame on PUCCH, a UE shall transmit CQI/PMI or RI and
$b(0),b(1)$ using PUCCH format 2b for normal CP or PUCCH format 2 for extended
CP, according to section 5.2.3.4 in [4] with $a_{0}^{''},a_{1}^{''}$ replaced
by $b(0),b(1)$. The value of $b(0),b(1)$ are generated according to Table
7.3-1 from the $U_{\text{DAI}} + N_{\text{SPS}}$ ACK/NACK responses including
ACK in response to PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release by spatial ACK/NACK
bundling across multiple codewords within each PDSCH transmission. For TDD UL-
DL configurations 1-6, if $U_{\text{DAI}} > 0$ and $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{DL}}
\neq \left( U_{\text{DAI}} - 1 \right)\text{mod}4 + 1$, the UE detects that at
least one downlink assignment has been missed.
When only ACK/NACK or only a positive SR is transmitted a UE shall use PUCCH
Format 1a or 1b for the ACK/NACK resource and PUCCH Format 1 for the SR
resource as defined in section 5.4.1 in [3].
# 8 Physical uplink shared channel related procedures
For FDD, there shall be 8 HARQ processes in the uplink for non-subframe
bundling operation, i.e. normal HARQ operation, and 4 HARQ processes in the
uplink for subframe bundling operation. The subframe bundling operation is
configured by the parameter _ttiBundling_ provided by higher layers.
In case higher layers configure the use of subframe bundling for FDD and TDD,
the subframe bundling operation is only applied to UL-SCH, such that four
consecutive uplink subframes are used.
For FDD and normal HARQ operation, the UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with
DCI format 0 and/or a PHICH transmission in subframe _n_ intended for the UE,
adjust the corresponding PUSCH transmission in subframe _n+4_ according to the
PDCCH and PHICH information.
For FDD and subframe bundling operation, the UE shall upon detection of a
PDCCH with DCI format 0 in subframe _n_ intended for the UE, and/or a PHICH
transmission in subframe _n-5_ intended for the UE, adjust the corresponding
first PUSCH transmission in the bundle in subframe _n+4_ according to the
PDCCH and PHICH information.
For FDD and TDD, the NDI as signalled on PDCCH, the RV as determined in
section 8.6.1, and the TBS as determined in section 8.6.2, shall be delivered
to higher layers.
For TDD, the number of HARQ processes shall be determined by the DL/UL
configuration (Table 4.2-2 of [3]), as indicated in table 8-1.

For TDD UL/DL configurations 1-6 and normal HARQ operation, the UE shall upon
detection of a PDCCH with DCI format 0 and/or a PHICH transmission in subframe
_n_ intended for the UE, adjust the corresponding PUSCH transmission in
subframe _n+k_ , with _k_ given in Table 8-2, according to the PDCCH and PHICH
information.
For TDD UL/DL configuration 0 and normal HARQ operation the UE shall upon
detection of a PDCCH with DCI format 0 and/or a PHICH transmission in subframe
_n_ intended for the UE, adjust the corresponding PUSCH transmission in
subframe _n+k_ if the MSB of the UL index in the DCI format 0 is set to 1 or
PHICH is received in subframe _n_ =0 or 5 in the resource corresponding to ,
as defined in Section 9.1.2, with _k_ given in Table 8-2. If, for TDD UL/DL
configuration 0 and normal HARQ operation, the LSB of the UL index in the DCI
format 0 is set to 1 in subframe _n_ or a PHICH is received in subframe _n_ =0
or 5 in the resource corresponding to , as defined in Section 9.1.2, or PHICH
is received in subframe _n_ =1 or 6, the UE shall adjust the corresponding
PUSCH transmission in subframe _n+7_. If, for TDD UL/DL configuration 0, both
the MSB and LSB of the UL index in the DCI format 0 are set in subframe _n_ ,
the UE shall adjust the corresponding PUSCH transmission in both subframes _n+
k_ and _n+7_ , with _k_ given in Table 8-2
For TDD UL/DL configurations 1 and 6 and subframe bundling operation, the UE
shall upon detection of a PDCCH with DCI format 0 in subframe _n_ intended for
the UE, and/or a PHICH transmission intended for the UE in subframe _n-l_ with
_l_ given in Table 8-2a, adjust the corresponding first PUSCH transmission in
the bundle in subframe _n+k_ , with _k given in Table 8-2,_ according to the
PDCCH and PHICH information.
For TDD UL/DL configuration 0 and subframe bundling operation, the UE shall
upon detection of a PDCCH with DCI format 0 in subframe _n_ intended for the
UE, and/or a PHICH transmission intended for the UE in subframe _n-l_ with _l_
given in Table 8-2a, adjust the corresponding first PUSCH transmission in the
bundle in subframe _n+k_ , if the MSB of the UL index in the DCI format 0 is
set to 1 or if , as defined in Section 9.1.2, with _k_ given in Table 8-2,
according to the PDCCH and PHICH information. If, for TDD UL/DL configuration
0 and subframe bundling operation, the LSB of the UL index in the DCI format 0
is set to 1 in subframe _n_ or if , as defined in Section 9.1.2, the UE shall
adjust the corresponding first PUSCH transmission in the bundle in subframe

## 8.1 Resource Allocation for PDCCH DCI Format 0
The resource allocation information indicates to a scheduled UE a set of
contiguously allocated virtual resource block indices denoted by
$n_{\text{VRB}}$. A resource allocation field in the scheduling grant consists
of a resource indication value (_RIV_) corresponding to a starting resource
block ($\text{RB}_{\text{START}}$) and a length in terms of contiguously
allocated resource blocks ($L_{\text{CRBs}}$≥ 1). The resource indication
value is defined by
if $(L_{\text{CRBs}} - 1) \leq \left\lfloor
\frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}}{2} \right\rfloor$ then
else
A UE shall discard PUSCH resource allocation in the corresponding PDCCH with
DCI format 0 if consistent control information is not detected.
## 8.2 UE sounding procedure
The following Sounding Reference Symbol (SRS) parameters are UE specific semi-
statically configurable by higher layers:
  * Transmission comb $k_{\text{TC}}$, as defined in Section 5.5.3.2 of [3]
  * Starting physical resource block assignment $n_{\text{RRC}}$, as defined in Section 5.5.3.2 of [3]
  * _duration_ : single or indefinite (until disabled), as defined in [11]
  * _srs-ConfigIndex_ I~SRS~ for SRS periodicity and SRS subframe offset $T_{\text{offset}}$, as defined in Table 8.2-1 and Table 8.2-2
  * SRS bandwidth $B_{\text{SRS}}$, as defined in Section 5.5.3.2 of [3]
  * Frequency hopping bandwidth, $b_{\text{hop}}$, as defined in Section 5.5.3.2 of [3]
  * Cyclic shift $n_{\text{SRS}}^{\text{cs}}$, as defined in Section 5.5.3.1 of [3]
The cell specific SRS transmission bandwidths $C_{\text{SRS}}$ are configured
by higher layers. The allowable values are given in Section 5.5.3.2 of [3].
The cell specific SRS transmission sub-frames are configured by higher layers.
The allowable values are given in Section 5.5.3.3 of [3].
When antenna selection is enabled for a UE that supports transmit antenna
selection, the index $a\left( n_{\text{SRS}} \right)$, of the UE antenna that
transmits the SRS at time _n~SRS~_ is given by
$a\left( n_{\text{SRS}} \right) = n_{\text{SRS}}\text{mod}2$, for both partial
and full sounding bandwidth, and when frequency hopping is disabled (i.e.,
$b_{\text{hop}} \geq B_{\text{SRS}}$),
$a(n_{\text{SRS}}) = \begin{matrix} \left{ \left( n_{\text{SRS}} +
\left\lfloor \frac{n_{\text{SRS}}}{2} \right\rfloor + \beta \cdot \left\lfloor
\frac{n_{\text{SRS}}}{K} \right\rfloor \right)\text{mod}2\text{\ \ when\
}K\text{\ is\ even\ \ } \middle| \right.\ \ \end{matrix}$,$\beta =
\begin{matrix} \left{ 1\text{\ \ \ where\ }K\text{mod}4 = 0 \middle| \right.\
\ \end{matrix}$
when frequency hopping is enabled (i.e., $b_{\text{hop}}  2$ and for FDD are
the subframes satisfying $(\text{10} \cdot n_{f} + k_{\text{SRS}} -
T_{\text{offset}})\text{mod}T_{\text{SRS}} = 0$, where for FDD $k_{\text{SRS}}
= \left{ 0,1,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},9 \right}$ is the subframe index within
the frame, for TDD $k_{\text{SRS}}$ is defined in Table 8.2-3. The SRS
transmission instances for TDD with $T_{\text{SRS}} = 2$ are the subframes
satisfying $(k_{\text{SRS}} - T_{\text{offset}})\text{mod}5 = 0$.
A UE shall not transmit SRS whenever SRS and a PUSCH transmission
corresponding to a Random Access Response Grant or a retransmission of the
same transport block as part of the contention based random access procedure
coincide in the same subframe.

## 8.3 UE ACK/NACK procedure
For Frame Structure type 1, an ACK/NACK received on the PHICH assigned to a UE

transmission in the subframe _i-k_ as indicated by the following table 8.3-1.
For Frame Structure type 2 UL/DL configuration 0, an ACK/NACK received on the
PHICH in the resource corresponding to , as defined in Section 9.1.2, assigned
to a UE in subframe _i_ is associated with the PUSCH transmission in the
subframe _i-k_ as indicated by the following table 8.3-1. If, for Frame
Structure type 2 UL/DL configuration 0, an ACK/NACK received on the PHICH in
the resource corresponding to , as defined in Section 9.1.2, assigned to a UE
in subframe _i_ is associated with the PUSCH transmission in the subframe _i-_

The physical layer in the UE shall deliver indications to the higher layers as
follows:
For downlink subframe _i_ , if a transport block was transmitted in the
associated PUSCH subframe then:
  * if ACK is decoded on the PHICH in subframe _i_ , ACK shall be delivered to the higher layers;
  * else NACK shall be delivered to the higher layers.
## 8.4 UE PUSCH Hopping procedure
The UE shall perform PUSCH frequency hopping if the single bit frequency
hopping (FH) field in a corresponding PDCCH with DCI format 0 is set to 1
otherwise no PUSCH frequency hopping is performed.
A UE performing PUSCH frequency hopping shall determine its PUSCH resource
allocation (RA) for the first slot of a subframe (_S1_) including the lowest
index PRB ($n_{\text{PRB}}^{S1}(n)$) in subframe _n_ from the resource
allocation field in the latest PDCCH with DCI format 0 for the same transport
block. If there is no PDCCH for the same transport block, the UE shall
determine its hopping type based on
  * the hopping information in the most recent semi-persistent scheduling assignment PDCCH, when the initial PUSCH for the same transport block is semi-persistently scheduled or
  * the random access response grant for the same transport block, when the PUSCH is initiated by the random access response grant.
The resource allocation field in DCI format 0 excludes either 1 or 2 bits used
for hopping information as indicated by Table 8.4-1 below where the number of
PUSCH resource blocks is defined as
For type 1 and type 2 PUSCH hopping,
${\overset{\sim}{N}}_{\text{RB}}^{\text{HO}} = N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{HO}} + 1$
if $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{HO}}$ is an odd number where
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{HO}}$ defined in [3].
${\overset{\sim}{N}}_{\text{RB}}^{\text{HO}} = N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{HO}}$ in
other cases. The size of the resource allocation field in DCI format 0 after
excluding either 1 or 2 bits shall be $y = \left\lceil
\text{log}_{2}(N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}(N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}} +
1\frac{)}{2}) \right\rceil - N_{\text{UL}_{\text{hop}}}$, where _N~UL_hop~_ =
1 or 2 bits. The number of contiguous RBs that can be assigned to a type-1
hopping user is limited to $\left\lfloor
\frac{2^{y}}{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}} \right\rfloor$. The number of
contiguous RBs that can be assigned to a type-2 hopping user is limited to
min($\left\lfloor \frac{2^{y}}{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}}
\right\rfloor$,$\left\lfloor
\frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PUSCH}}}{N_{\text{sb}}} \right\rfloor$), where the
number of sub-bands $N_{\text{sb}}$ is given by higher layers.
A UE performing PUSCH frequency hopping shall use one of two possible PUSCH
frequency hopping types based on the hopping information. PUSCH hopping type 1
is described in section 8.4.1 and type 2 is described in section 8.4.2.
Table 8.4-1: Number of Hopping Bits N~UL_hop~ vs. System Bandwidth
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ | System BW $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}$ | #Hopping bits for 2nd slot RA | | | | | | (_N~UL_hop~_) | +---------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ | 6-49 | 1 | +---------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ | 50-110 | 2 | +---------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
The parameter _Hopping-mode_ provided by higher layers determines if PUSCH
frequency hopping is "inter-subframe" or "intra and inter-subframe".
### 8.4.1 Type 1 PUSCH Hopping
For PUSCH hopping type 1 the hopping bit or bits indicated in Table 8.4-1
determine${\overset{\sim}{n}}_{\text{PRB}}(i)$ as defined in Table 8.4-2. The
lowest index PRB () of the 1^st^ slot RA in subframe _i_ is defined as , where
, and $\text{RB}_{\text{START}}$is obtained from the uplink scheduling grant
as in Section 8.4 and Section 8.1.
The lowest index PRB ($n_{\text{PRB}}(i)$) of the 2^nd^ slot RA in subframe
_i_ is defined as _._
The set of physical resource blocks to be used for PUSCH transmission are
$L_{\text{CRBs}}$contiguously allocated resource blocks from PRB index for the
1^st^ slot, and from PRB index $n_{\text{PRB}}(i)$ for the 2^nd^ slot,
respectively, where $L_{\text{CRBs}}$is obtained from the uplink scheduling
grant as in Section 8.4 and Section 8.1.
If the _Hopping-mode_ is \"inter-subframe\", the 1^st^ slot RA is applied to
even CURRENT_TX_NB, and the 2^nd^ slot RA is applied to odd CURRENT_TX_NB,
where CURRENT_TX_NB is defined in [8].
### 8.4.2 Type 2 PUSCH Hopping
In PUSCH hopping type 2 the set of physical resource blocks to be used for
transmission in slot $n_{s}$ is given by the scheduling grant together with a
predefined pattern according to [3] section 5.3.4. If the system frame number
is not acquired by the UE yet, the UE shall not transmit PUSCH with type-2
hopping and for TDD, where is defined in [3].

## 8.5 UE Reference Symbol procedure
If UL sequence hopping is configured in the cell, it applies to all reference
symbols (SRS, PUSCH and PUCCH RS).
## 8.6 Modulation order, redundancy version and transport block size
determination
To determine the modulation order, redundancy version and transport block size
for the physical uplink shared channel, the UE shall first
  * read the "modulation and coding scheme and redundancy version" field ($I_{\text{MCS}}$), and
  * check the "CQI request" bit, and
  * compute the total number of allocated PRBs ($N_{\text{PRB}}$) based on the procedure defined in Section 8.1, and
  * compute the number of coded symbols for control information.
### 8.6.1 Modulation order and redundancy version determination
For$0 \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{28}$, the modulation order ($Q_{m}$) is
determined as follows:
  * If the UE is capable of supporting 64QAM in PUSCH and has not been configured by higher layers to transmit only QPSK and 16QAM, the modulation order is given by $Q_{m}^{'}$in Table 8.6.1-1.
  * If the UE is not capable of supporting 64QAM in PUSCH or has been configured by higher layers to transmit only QPSK and 16QAM, $Q_{m}^{'}$is first read from Table 8.6.1-1. The modulation order is set to $Q_{m} = \text{min}(4,Q_{m}^{'})$**.**
  * If the parameter _ttiBundling_ provided by higher layers is set to _TRUE_ , then the resource allocation size is restricted to $N_{\text{PRB}} \leq 3$ and the modulation order is set to $Q_{m} = 2$.
For$\text{29} \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{31}$, if$I_{\text{MCS}} =
\text{29}$, the "CQI request" bit in DCI format 0 is set to 1 and
$N_{\text{PRB}} \leq 4$, the modulation order is set to $Q_{m} = 2$.
Otherwise, the modulation order shall be determined from the DCI transported
in the latest PDCCH with DCI format 0 for the same transport block using $0
\leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{28}$. If there is no PDCCH with DCI format 0
for the same transport block using $0 \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{28}$, the
modulation order shall be determined from
  * the most recent semi-persistent scheduling assignment PDCCH, when > the initial PUSCH for the same transport block is > semi-persistently scheduled, or,
  * the random access response grant for the same transport block, when > the PUSCH is initiated by the random access response grant.
The UE shall use$I_{\text{MCS}}$and Table 8.6.1-1 to determine the redundancy
version (_rv~idx~_) to use in the physical uplink shared channel.

### 8.6.2 Transport block size determination
For$0 \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{28}$, the UE shall first determine the
TBS index ($I_{\text{TBS}}$) using$I_{\text{MCS}}$and Table 8.6.1-1. The UE
shall then follow the procedure in Section 7.1.7.2.1 to determine the
transport block size.
For$\text{29} \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{31}$, if$I_{\text{MCS}} =
\text{29}$, the "CQI request" bit in DCI format 0 is set to 1
and$N_{\text{PRB}} \leq 4$, then there is no transport block for the UL-SCH
and only the control information feedback for the current PUSCH reporting mode
is transmitted by the UE. Otherwise, the transport block size shall be
determined from the initial PDCCH for the same transport block using $0 \leq
I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{28}$. If there is no initial PDCCH with DCI format 0
for the same transport block using $0 \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq \text{28}$, the
transport block size shall be determined from
  * the most recent semi-persistent scheduling assignment PDCCH, when > the initial PUSCH for the same transport block is > semi-persistently scheduled, or,
  * the random access response grant for the same transport block, when > the PUSCH is initiated by the random access response grant.
### 8.6.3 Control information MCS offset determination
$\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK}}$,
$\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{RI}}$ and $\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{CQI}}$
shall be configured to values according to Table 8.6.3-1,2,3 with the higher
layer signalled indexes $I_{\text{offset}}^{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK}}$,
$I_{\text{offset}}^{\text{RI}}$, and $I_{\text{offset}}^{\text{CQI}}$,
respectively.

## 8.7 UE Transmit Antenna Selection
UE transmit antenna selection is configured by higher layers.
If UE transmit antenna selection is disabled or not supported by the UE, the
UE shall transmit from UE port 0.
If closed-loop UE transmit antenna selection is enabled by higher layers the
UE shall perform transmit antenna selection in response to the most recent
command received via DCI Format 0 in section 5.3.3.2 [4].
If open-loop UE transmit antenna selection is enabled by higher layers, the
transmit antenna to be selected by the UE is not specified.
# 9 Physical downlink control channel procedures
## 9.1 UE procedure for determining physical downlink control channel
assignment
### 9.1.1 PDCCH Assignment Procedure
The control region consists of a set of CCEs, numbered from 0 to
$N_{\text{CCE},k} - 1$ according to Section 6.8.1 in [3], where
$N_{\text{CCE},k}$ is the total number of CCEs in the control region of
subframe $k$. The UE shall monitor a set of PDCCH candidates for control
information in every non-DRX subframe, where monitoring implies attempting to
decode each of the PDCCHs in the set according to all the monitored DCI
formats.
The set of PDCCH candidates to monitor are defined in terms of search spaces,
where a search space $S_{k}^{(L)}$ at aggregation level $L \in \left{ 1,2,4,8
\right}$ is defined by a set of PDCCH candidates. The CCEs corresponding to
PDCCH candidate _m_ of the search space $S_{k}^{(L)}$ are given by
where is defined below, and . $M^{(L)}$ is the number of PDCCH candidates to
monitor in the given search space.
The UE shall monitor one common search space at each of the aggregation levels
4 and 8 and one UE-specific search space at each of the aggregation levels 1,
2, 4, 8. The common and UE-specific search spaces may overlap.
The aggregation levels defining the search spaces are listed in Table 9.1.1-1.
The DCI formats that the UE shall monitor depend on the configured
transmission mode as defined in Section 7.1.
Table 9.1.1-1: PDCCH candidates monitored by a UE.

For the common search spaces, is set to 0 for the two aggregation levels $L =
4$ and $L = 8$.
For the UE-specific search space $S_{k}^{(L)}$ at aggregation level$L$, the
variable is defined by
where $Y_{- 1} = n_{\text{RNTI}} \neq 0$, $A = \text{39827}$, $D =
\text{65537}$ and , is the slot number within a radio frame. The RNTI value
used for $n_{\text{RNTI}}$ is defined in section 7.1 in downlink and section 8
in uplink.
### 9.1.2 PHICH Assignment Procedure
For scheduled PUSCH transmissions in subframe _n_ , a UE shall determine the
corresponding PHICH resource in subframe , where is always 4 for FDD and is
given in table 9.1.2-1 for TDD. For subframe bundling operation, the
corresponding PHICH resource is associated with the last subframe in the
bundle.

## 9.2 PDCCH validation for semi-persistent scheduling
A UE shall validate a Semi-Persistent Scheduling assignment PDCCH only if all
the following conditions are met:
> \- the CRC parity bits obtained for the PDCCH payload are scrambled with the
> Semi-Persistent Scheduling C-RNTI
>
> \- the new data indicator field is set to '0'. In case of DCI formats 2, 2A
> and 2B, the new data indicator field refers to the one for the enabled
> transport block.
Validation is achieved if all the fields for the respective used DCI format
are set according to Table 9.2-1 or Table 9.2-1A.
If validation is achieved, the UE shall consider the received DCI information
accordingly as a valid semi-persistent activation or release.
If validation is not achieved, the received DCI format shall be considered by
the UE as having been received with a non-matching CRC.

For the case that the DCI format indicates a semi-persistent downlink
scheduling activation, the TPC command for PUCCH field shall be used as an
index to one of the four PUCCH resource indices configured by higher layers,

# 10 Physical uplink control channel procedures
## 10.1 UE procedure for determining physical uplink control channel
assignment
Uplink control information (UCI) in subframe $n$ shall be transmitted
  * on PUCCH using format 1/1a/1b or 2/2a/2b if the UE is not transmitting on PUSCH in subframe $n$
  * on PUSCH if the UE is transmitting on PUSCH in subframe $n$unless the PUSCH transmission corresponds to a Random Access Response Grant or a retransmission of the same transport block as part of the contention based random access procedure, in which case UCI is not transmitted
Throughout this section, subframes are numbered in monotonically increasing
order; if the last subframe of a radio frame is denoted as $k$, the first
subframe of the next radio frame is denoted as $k + 1$.
Using the PUCCH formats defined in section 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 in [3], the
following combinations of uplink control information on PUCCH are supported:
  * Format 1a for 1-bit HARQ-ACK or in case of FDD for 1-bit HARQ-ACK with positive SR
  * Format 1b for 2-bit HARQ-ACK or for 2-bit HARQ-ACK with positive SR
  * Format 1b for HARQ-ACK with channel selection
  * Format 1 for positive SR
  * Format 2 for a CQI/PMI or a RI report when not multiplexed with HARQ-ACK
  * Format 2a for a CQI/PMI or a RI report multiplexed with 1-bit HARQ-ACK for normal cyclic prefix
  * Format 2b for a CQI/PMI or a RI report multiplexed with 2-bit HARQ-ACK for normal cyclic prefix
  * Format 2 for a CQI/PMI or a RI report multiplexed with HARQ-ACK for extended cyclic prefix
The scrambling initialization of PUCCH format 2, 2a and 2b is by C-RNTI.
In case of collision between a CQI/PMI/RI and an HARQ-ACK in a same subframe
without PUSCH, the CQI/PMI/RI is multiplexed with HARQ-ACK on PUCCH if the
parameter _simultaneousAckNackAndCQI_ provided by higher layers is set _TRUE_
, otherwise the CQI/PMI/RI is dropped.
In case of collision between a periodic CQI/PMI/RI and an HARQ-ACK in a same
subframe with PUSCH, the periodic CQI/PMI/RI is multiplexed with the HARQ-ACK
in the PUSCH transmission in that subframe.
For TDD, two ACK/NACK feedback modes are supported by higher layer
configuration.
  * ACK/NACK bundling and
  * ACK/NACK multiplexing
For TDD UL-DL configuration 5, only ACK/NACK bundling is supported.
TDD ACK/NACK bundling is performed per codeword across $M$ multiple DL
subframes associated with a single UL subframe _n_ , where $M$ is the number
of elements in the set $K$ defined in Table 10.1-1, by a logical AND operation
of all the individual PDSCH transmission (with and without corresponding
PDCCH) ACK/NACKs and ACK in response to PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release.
The bundled 1 or 2 ACK/NACK bits are transmitted using PUCCH format 1a or
PUCCH format 1b, respectively.
For TDD ACK/NACK multiplexing and a subframe _n_ with$M > 1$, where $M$ is the
number of elements in the set $K$ defined in Table 10.1-1, spatial ACK/NACK
bundling across multiple codewords within a DL subframe is performed by a
logical AND operation of all the corresponding individual ACK/NACKs and PUCCH
format 1b with channel selection is used. For TDD ACK/NACK multiplexing and a
subframe _n_ with $M = 1$, spatial ACK/NACK bundling across multiple codewords
within a DL subframe is not performed, 1 or 2 ACK/NACK bits are transmitted
using PUCCH format 1a or PUCCH format 1b, respectively.
For FDD, the UE shall use PUCCH resource $n_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(1)}$ for
transmission of HARQ-ACK in subframe $n$, where
  * for a PDSCH transmission indicated by the detection of a corresponding PDCCH in subframe $n - 4$, or for a PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release (defined in section 9.2) in subframe $n - 4$, the UE shall use $n_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(1)} = n_{\text{CCE}} + N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(1)}$, where $n_{\text{CCE}}$ is the number of the first CCE used for transmission of the corresponding DCI assignment and $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(1)}$ is configured by higher layers.
  * for a PDSCH transmission where there is not a corresponding PDCCH detected in subframe $n - 4$, the value of $n_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(1)}$ is determined according to higher layer configuration and Table 9.2-2.
For TDD ACK/NACK bundling or TDD ACK/NACK multiplexing and a subframe _n_ with
$M = 1$ where $M$ is the number of elements in the set $K$ defined in Table
10.1-1, the UE shall use PUCCH resource $n_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(1)}$ for
transmission of HARQ-ACK in subframe $n$, where
  * If there is PDSCH transmission indicated by the detection of corresponding PDCCH or there is PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release within subframe(s) $n - k$, where $k \in K$ and $K$ _(defined in Table 10.1-1) is a set of M elements depending on the subframe n_ and the UL-DL configuration (defined in Table 4.2-2 in [3]), the UE first selects a value out of {0, 1, 2, 3} which makes and shall use , where $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(1)}$ is configured by higher layers, , and $n_{\text{CCE}}$ is the number of the first CCE used for transmission of the corresponding PDCCH in subframe and the corresponding _m_ , where is the smallest value in set such that UE detects a PDCCH in subframe .
  * If there is only a PDSCH transmission where there is not a corresponding PDCCH detected within subframe(s) $n - k$, where $k \in K$and $K$ is defined in Table 10.1-1, the value of $n_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(1)}$ is determined according to higher layer configuration and Table 9.2-2.

The UE shall transmit $b(0),b(1)$ on an ACK/NACK resource in sub-frame $n$
using PUCCH format 1b according to section 5.4.1 in [3]. The value of
$b(0),b(1)$ and the ACK/NACK resource are generated by channel selection
according to Table 10.1-2, 10.1-3, and 10.1-4 for _M_ = 2, 3, and 4,

## 10.2 Uplink ACK/NACK timing
For FDD, the UE shall upon detection of a PDSCH transmission in subframe _n-4_
intended for the UE and for which an ACK/NACK shall be provided, transmit the
ACK/NACK response in subframe _n_. If ACK/NACK repetition is enabled, upon
detection of a PDSCH transmission in subframe _n-4_ intended for the UE and
for which ACK/NACK response shall be provided, and if the UE is not repeating
the transmission of any ACK/NACK in subframe $n$ corresponding to a PDSCH
transmission in subframes $n - N_{\text{ANRep}} - 3$, ... , $n - 5$, the UE:
  * shall transmit only the ACK/NACK response (corresponding to the detected PDSCH transmission in subframe $n - 4$) on PUCCH in subframes $n$, $n + 1$, ..., $n + N_{\text{ANRep}} - 1$;
  * shall not transmit any other signal in subframes $n$, $n + 1$, ..., $n + N_{\text{ANRep}} - 1$; and
  * shall not transmit any ACK/NACK response repetitions corresponding to any detected PDSCH transmission in subframes $n - 3$, ..., $n + N_{\text{ANRep}} - 5$.
For TDD, the UE shall upon detection of a PDSCH transmission within
subframe(s) $n - k$, where $k \in K$ and $K$ is defined in Table 10.1-1
intended for the UE and for which ACK/NACK response shall be provided,
transmit the ACK/NACK response in UL subframe _n_. If ACK/NACK repetition is
enabled, upon detection of a PDSCH transmission within subframe(s) $n - k$,
where $k \in K$ and $K$ is defined in Table 10.1-1 intended for the UE and for
which ACK/NACK response shall be provided, and if the UE is not repeating the
transmission of any ACK/NACK in subframe $n$ corresponding to a PDSCH
transmission in a DL subframe earlier than subframe $n - k$, the UE:
  * shall transmit only the ACK/NACK response (corresponding to the detected PDSCH transmission in subframe$n - k$) on PUCCH in UL subframe$n$ and the next $N_{\text{ANRep}} - 1$UL subframes denoted as $n_{1}$, ...,$n_{N_{\text{ANRep}} - 1}$;
```{=html}
``` \- shall not transmit any other signal in UL subframe $n$, $n_{1}$,
...,$n_{N_{\text{ANRep}} - 1}$; and
```{=html}
``` \- shall not transmit any ACK/NACK response repetitions corresponding to
any detected PDSCH transmission in subframes $n_{i} - k$, where $k \in K_{i}$,
$K_{i}$is the set defined in Table 10.1-1 corresponding to UL subframe
$n_{i}$, and $1 \leq i \leq N_{\text{ANRep}} - 1$.
For TDD, ACK/NACK bundling, if the UE detects that at least one downlink
assignment has been missed as described in Section 7.3, the UE shall not
transmit ACK/NACK in case the UE is not transmitting on PUSCH.
The uplink timing for the ACK corresponding to a detected PDCCH indicating
downlink SPS release shall be the same as the uplink timing for the ACK/NACK
corresponding to a detected PDSCH, as defined above.
# 11 Physical multicast channel related procedures
## 11.1 UE procedure for receiving the physical multicast channel
The UE shall decode the PMCH when configured by higher layers. The UE may
assume that an eNB transmission on the PMCH is performed according to Section
6.5 of [3].
The$I_{\text{MCS}}$for the PMCH is configured by higher layers. The UE shall
use$I_{\text{MCS}}$for the PMCH and Table 7.1.7.1-1 to determine the
modulation order ($Q_{m}$) and TBS index ($I_{\text{TBS}}$) used in the PMCH.
The UE shall then follow the procedure in Section 7.1.7.2.1 to determine the
transport block size, assuming $N_{\text{PRB}}$is equal
to$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}$.
## 11.2 UE procedure for receiving MCCH change notification
If a UE is configured by higher layers to decode PDCCHs with the CRC scrambled
by the M-RNTI, the UE shall decode the PDCCH according to the combination
defined in table 11.2-1.
Table 11.2-1: PDCCH configured by M-RNTI

The 8-bit information for MCCH change notification [11], as signalled on the
PDCCH, shall be delivered to higher layers.
