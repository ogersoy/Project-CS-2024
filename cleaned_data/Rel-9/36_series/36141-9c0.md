# 4 General test conditions and declarations
Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter relative to a
value that is not fully specified in the E-UTRA specifications. For these
tests, the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal value
specified by the manufacturer.
Certain functions of a BS are optional in the E-UTRA specifications. Some
requirements for the BS may be regional as listed in subclause 4.3.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported.
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and Test Requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.
The Minimum Requirements are given in 36.104 [2] and test requirements are
given in this specification. Test Tolerances are defined in Annex G of this
specification. Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The
Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in 36.104 [2] to
create Test Requirements.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the stimulus
signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance and
the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the
specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and
are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the Shared Risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [3].
The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the measurement of
each parameter shall be included in the test report.
The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in subclause 4.1.2
of this specification.
If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in subclause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to use
this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
subclause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the Test Requirement, making the test
harder to pass. (For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this may require
modification of stimulus signals). This procedure (defined in Annex G) will
ensure that a Test System not compliant with subclause 4.1.2 does not increase
the chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with subclause 4.1.2 had been
used.
## 4.2 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Station, Local
Area Base Station and Home Base Station unless other wise stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 8.
Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB**.
Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Femto
Cell** scenarios.
The manufacturer shall declare the intended class of the BS under test.
## 4.3 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements or set by local and regional regulation as
mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances that the requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.3-1 lists all requirements that may be applied differently in
different regions.
Table 4.3-1: List of regional requirements

applied regionally. 5.6 Channel bandwidth Some channel bandwidths may be
applied regionally. 5.7 Channel arrangement The requirement is applied
according to what operating bands in Clause 5.5 that are supported by the BS.
6.2. Base station maximum output power In certain regions, the minimum
requirement for normal conditions may apply also for some conditions outside
the range of conditions defined as normal. In certain regions, additional
regional requirement specified in subclause 6.2.2 in [1] is applied for rated
output power declared by the manufacturer. 6.6.3.5.1 Operating band unwanted
emissions (Category A) This requirement is mandatory for regions where
Category A limits for spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation

This requirement is mandatory for regions where Category B limits for spurious
emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [5], apply. 6.6.3.5.3
Additional requirements These requirements may apply in certain regions as
additional Operating band unwanted emission limits. 6.6.4.5.1 Spurious
emissions (Category A) This requirement is mandatory for regions where
Category A limits for spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation

is mandatory for regions where Category B limits for spurious emissions, as
defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [5], apply. 6.6.4.5.4 Additional
spurious emission requirements These requirements may be applied for the
protection of system operating in frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA BS
operating band. 6.6.4.5.5 Co-location with other base stations These
requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when a BS
operating in another frequency band is co‑located with an E‑UTRA BS. 7.6.5.2
Co-location with other base stations These requirements may be applied for the
protection of the BS receivers when a BS operating in another frequency band
is co‑-located with an E-UTRA BS.
* * *
## 4.4 Selection of configurations for testing
Most tests in the present document are only performed for a subset of the
possible combinations of test conditions. For instance:
\- Not all transceivers in the configuration may be specified to be tested;
\- Only one RF channel may be specified to be tested;
\- Not all channel bandwidths may be specified to be tested.
## 4.5 BS Configurations
### 4.5.1 Transmit configurations
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics in clause 6 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.5-1: Transmitter test ports
#### 4.5.1.1 Transmit diversity and MIMO transmission
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present document,
the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector in the case of
transmit diversity or MIMO transmission.
Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to measure
the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors,.
### 4.5.2 Receive configurations
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics in clause 7 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.5-2: Receiver test ports
#### 4.5.2.1 Receiver diversity
For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement applies at
each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna diversity.
Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the remaining
receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the
manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be equivalent, it is
sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any one of the receiver
antenna connectors.
### 4.5.3 Duplexers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer fitted,
if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS. If the duplexer is supplied as an
option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests should be repeated with and
without the duplexer fitted to verify that the BS meets the requirements of
the present document in both cases.
The following tests shall be performed with the duplexer fitted, and without
it fitted if this is an option:
1) subclause 6.2, base station output power, for the highest static power step
only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;
2) subclause 6.6, unwanted emissions; outside the BS transmit band;
3) subclause 6.6.4.5.3, protection of the BS receiver;
4) subclause 6.7, transmit intermodulation; for the testing of conformance,
the carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize intermodulation
products from the transmitters falling in receive channels.
The remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer fitted.
NOTE 1: When performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is important
to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not affect the test
apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of attenuators, isolators
and filters.
NOTE 2: When duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be generated,
not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The intermodulation
products generated in the antenna system are not controlled by 3GPP
specifications, and may degrade during operation (e.g. due to moisture
ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued satisfactory operation of a BS, an
operator will normally select EARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products
falling on receive channels. For testing of complete conformance, an operator
may specify the EARFCNs to be used.
### 4.5.4 Power supply options
If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply configurations,
it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the power supply
options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of conditions
over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the range of
conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be supplied
either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In this case, the
conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power supply options can be
tested by testing only the external DC supply option. The range of DC input
voltages for the test should be sufficient to verify the performance with any
of the power supplies, over its range of operating conditions within the BS,
including variation of mains input voltage, temperature and output current.
### 4.5.5 Ancillary RF amplifiers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with the ancillary RF
amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7 for TX and RX
respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting
network (including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to
make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary amplifier and
the BS. The applicable connecting network loss range is declared by the
manufacturer. Other characteristics and the temperature dependence of the
attenuation of the connecting network are neglected. The actual attenuation
value of the connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the
applicable extreme values. The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.
Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted and,
if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.
When testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where x denotes that
the test is applicable:
Table 4.5-1: Tests applicable to Ancillary RF Amplifiers
* * *
Receiver Tests Subclause TX amplifier only RX amplifier only TX/RX amplifiers
combined (Note) 7.2 X X 7.5 (Narrowband blocking) X X 7.6 X X 7.7 x X 7.8 x  
Transmitter Tests 6.2 x X 6.6.1 X X 6.6.2 X x 6.6.3 X x 6.6.4 x X 6.7 x X
* * *
NOTE: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The amplifiers
can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of these amplifiers
could be a passive network.
In test according to subclauses 6.2 and 7.2 highest applicable attenuation
value is applied.
### 4.5.6 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the integrated
Iuant BS modem shall be switched off. Spurious emissions according to clauses
6.6.4 and 7.7 shall be measured only for frequencies above 20MHz with the
integrated Iuant BS modem switched on.
### 4.5.7 BS using antenna arrays
A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some or all
of its transceivers or with an antenna array related to one cell (not one
array per transceiver). This subclause applies to a BS which meets at least
one of the following conditions:
\- the transmitter output signals from one or more transceiver appear at more
than one antenna port; or
\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a transceiver or per cell
and an input signal is required at more than one port for the correct
operation of the receiver thus the outputs from the transmitters as well as
the inputs to the receivers are directly connected to several antennas (known
as \"aircombining\"); or
\- transmitters and receivers are connected via duplexers to more than one
antenna.
In case of diversity or spatial multiplexing, multiple antennas are not
considered as an antenna array.
If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with an antenna system
which contains filters or active elements which are necessary to meet the
E-UTRA requirements, the conformance tests may be performed on a system
comprising the BS together with these elements, supplied separately for the
purposes of testing. In this case, it must be demonstrated that the
performance of the configuration under test is representative of the system in
normal operation, and the conformance assessment is only applicable when the
BS is used with the antenna system.
For conformance testing of such a BS, the following procedure may be used.
#### 4.5.7.1 Receiver tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna connectors
shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals the
power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.5.7.1-1.
.
Figure 4.5.7.1-1: Receiver test set-up
For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may be
performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.
#### 4.5.7.2 Transmitter tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the transmitter antenna connectors
**(P~i~)** shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied
equals the power of the test signal(s) **(P~s~)** specified in the test. This
may be assessed by separately measuring the signals emitted by each antenna
connector and summing the results, or by combining the signals and performing
a single measurement. The characteristics (e.g. amplitude and phase) of the
combining network should be such that the power of the combined signal is
maximised.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.5.7.2-1.
Figure 4.5.7.2-1: Transmitter test set-up
For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately for each
transmitter antenna connector.

6.6.3.5.1 need not be tested.
\- conformance with the spurious emissions requirements in clause 6.6.4.5.2 is
mandatory, and the requirements specified in clause 6.6.4.5.1 need not be
tested.
### 4.6.5 Additional operating band unwanted emissions
The manufacturer shall declare whether the BS under test is intended to
operate in geographic areas where the additional operating band unwanted
emission limits defined in clause 6.6.3.5.3 apply. If this is the case,
compliance with the test requirement specified in Tables 6.6.3.5.3-1,
6.6.3.5.3-2 or 6.6.3.5.3-3 are mandatory; otherwise these requirements need
not be tested.
For a BS declared to support Band 20 and to operate in geographic areas within
the CEPT in which frequencies are allocated to broadcasting (DTT) service, the
manufacturer shall additionally declare the following quantities associated
with the applicable test conditions of Table 6.6.3.5.3-4 and information in
annex G of [2] :

operate in geographic areas where one or more of the systems GSM850, GSM900,
DCS1800, PCS1900, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA and/or PHS operating in another
band are deployed. If this is the case, compliance with the applicable test
requirement for spurious emissions specified in clause 6.6.4.5.4 shall be
tested.
### 4.6.7 Co-location with other base stations
The manufacturer shall declare whether the BS under test is intended to
operate co-located with base stations of one or more of the systems GSM850,
GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA operating in
another band. If this is the case,
\- compliance with the applicable test requirement for spurious emissions
specified in clause 6.6.4.5.5 shall be tested.
\- compliance with the applicable test requirement for receiver blocking
specified in clause 7.6 shall be tested.
## 4.7 Specified frequency range and supported channel bandwidth

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single carrier at
each of the RF channels B, M and T.
When the requirements are specific to multiple carriers, and the BS is
declared to support N>1 carriers, numbered from 1 to N, the interpretation of

Figure 5.6-1 shows the relation between the Channel bandwidth (BW~Channel~)
and the Transmission bandwidth configuration (N~RB~). The channel edges are
defined as the lowest and highest frequencies of the carrier separated by the
channel bandwidth, i.e. at F~C~ +/- BW~Channel~ /2.

## 5.7 Channel arrangement
### 5.7.1 Channel spacing
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The nominal
channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.7.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the carrier
centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.
### 5.7.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN
The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 - 65535\. The
relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink is
given by the following equation, where F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation where F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in Clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. BS
configurations for the tests are defined in Clause 4.5, while Annex H provides
an informative description of E-UTRAN test cases.
#### 6.1.1 E-UTRA Test Models
The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according to
one of the E-UTRA test models (E-TM) below. A reference to the applicable test
model is made within each test.
The following general parameters are used by all E-UTRA test models:
  * The test models are defined for a single antenna port (using _p_ = 0); 1 code word (_q_ = 0), 1 layer, precoding is not used
  * Duration is 10 subframes (10 ms)
  * Normal CP
  * Virtual resource blocks of localized type, no intra-subframe hopping for PDSCH
  * UE-specific reference signals are not used
Power settings of physical channels are defined by physical channel EPRE
relative to the EPRE of the RS. The relative accuracy of the physical channel
EPRE as referred to the EPRE of the RS shall have a tolerance of ±0.5 dB.
For E-UTRA TDD, test models are derived based on the uplink/downlink
configuration 3 and special subframe configuration 8 defined in TS36.211, i.e.
as showing in the table 6.1.1-1. Number of frames for the test models is 2.

be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

filter of bandwidth equal to the RF bandwidth of the BS centred on the central
frequency of the RF bandwidth. 70μs average window centre is set from 35μs
after end of one transmitter ON period + 17μs to 35μs before start of next
transmitter ON period -- 17μs.

## 6.6 Unwanted emissions
Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious emissions
[5]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics
emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency
conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is specified both
in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and Operating band
unwanted emissions. The Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted
emissions in the downlink operating band plus the frequency ranges 10 MHz
above and 10 MHz below the band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency
range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.
There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.
### 6.6.1 Occupied bandwidth
#### 6.6.1.1 Definition and applicability
The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below the
lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are each
equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean transmitted power.
The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.
#### 6.6.1.2 Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 6.6.1.
#### 6.6.1.3 Test purpose
The occupied bandwidth, defined in the Radio Regulations of the International
Telecommunication Union ITU, is a useful concept for specifying the spectral
properties of a given emission in the simplest possible manner; see also ITU-R
Recommendation SM.328 [4]. The test purpose is to verify that the emission of
the BS does not occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided
and is, therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of the
spectrum beyond undue limits.
#### 6.6.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.6.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex D.2.
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 4.7.
Connect the Measurement device to the BS antenna connector as shown in Annex
I.1.1.
2) Start transmission according to E-TM1.1 at the manufacturer's specified
maximum output power.
##### 6.6.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at least the
number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in Table
6.6.1.4.2-1. The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser
shall be 30 kHz or less.
Table 6.6.1.4.2-1 Span and number of measurement points for OBW measurements
* * *
Channel bandwidth BW~Channel~ [MHz] 1.4 3 5 10 15 20 Span [MHz] 10 10 10 20 30
40 Minimum number of measurement points 1429 667 400 400 400 400
* * *
NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode must be power
responding. The analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.
2) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the power
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total power
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0.
3) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
4) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.
5) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
#### 6.6.1.5 Test requirements
The occupied bandwidth shall be less than the channel bandwidth as defined in
Table 5. 6-1.
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test and the explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed
by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex G.
### 6.6.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean
power centered on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
centered on an adjacent channel frequency.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. For a multi-carrier BS, the
requirement applies for the adjacent channel frequencies below the lowest
carrier frequency transmitted by the BS and above the highest carrier
frequency transmitted by the BS for each supported multi-carrier transmission
configuration.
#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 6.6.2.1
#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose
To verify that the adjacent channel leakage power ratio requirement shall be
met as specified by the minimum requirement.
#### 6.6.2.4 Method of test
##### 6.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex D.2.
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T with multiple carriers if supported; see
subclause 4.7.
1) Connect measurement device to the base station RF output port as shown in
Annex I.1.1.
2) The measurement device characteristics shall be:
\- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in subclause 6.6.2.5;
\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.
3) Set the base station to transmit a signal according to E-TM1.1. The mean
power at the RF output port shall be the maximum output power as specified by
the manufacturer.
4) Set carrier frequency within the frequency band supported by BS.
##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Measure Adjacent channel leakage power ratio for the frequency offsets both
side of channel frequency as specified in Table 6.6.2-1 (Paired spectrum case)
or Table 6.6.2-2 (Unpaired spectrum case) respectively. In multiple carrier
case only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier
frequency used shall be measured.
2) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to E-TM1.2.
#### 6.6.2.5 Test Requirement
The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal (BW~Config~)
centered on the assigned channel frequency and a filter centered on the
adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.
For Category A Wide Area BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables below or the
absolute limit of -13 dBm/MHz apply, whichever is less stringent.

### 6.6.3 Operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.6.3.1 Definition and applicability
Unless otherwise stated, the Operating band unwanted emission limits are
defined from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the downlink operating band
up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the downlink operating band (see
Table 5.5-1).
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by
the manufacturer\'s specification.
The unwanted emission limits in the part of the downlink operating band that
falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R Recommendation SM.329
[5].
For a multicarrier E-UTRA BS the definitions above apply to the lower edge of
the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the higher edge of
the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency.
For Wide Area BS, the requirements of either subclause 6.6.3.5.1 (Category A
limits) or subclause 6.6.3.5.2 (Category B limits) shall apply.
For Local Area BS, the requirements of subclause 6.6.3.5.2A shall apply
(Category A and B).
For Home BS, the requirements of subclause 6.6.3.5.2X shall apply (Category A
and B).
The application of either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as
for Transmitter spurious emissions (Mandatory Requirements) in subclause
6.6.4.5.
For Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options for
the limits that may be applied regionally. Either the limits in subclause
6.6.3.5.2.1 or subclause 6.6.3.5.2.2 shall be applied.

##### 6.6.4.5.4 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area
##### 6.6.4.5.4.1 Additional spurious emissions requirements {#additional-
spurious-emissions-requirements .H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA BS operating band. The limits may apply
as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the E-UTRA BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA operating band. It is in
some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is
mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this
is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements
in the present document is given in Clause 4.3.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, etc.) as listed below. The power of any spurious emission shall not
exceed the limits of Table 6.6.4.5.4-1 for a BS where requirements for co-
existence with the system listed in the first column apply.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
existence requirements in Table 6.6.4.5.4-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see Table
5.5-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by
local or regional requirements.
NOTE 2: The table above assumes that two operating bands, where the frequency
ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency
arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements
may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.4.5.4-1x for a Home BS where requirements for co-existence with a Home BS
type listed in the first column apply.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the
coexistence requirements in Table 6.6.4.5.4-1x do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the Home BS transmit frequency range of a
downlink operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz
below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and
10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating
band (see Table 5.5-1).
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

The following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Bands 13 and 14
to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 700 MHz
public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency
range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS transmitter operating
band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS transmitter operating
band. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

##### 6.6.4.5.5 Co-location with other base stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with an E-UTRA BS.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.4.5.5-1 for a Wide Area BS where requirements for co-location with a BS
type listed in the first column apply.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in Table 6.6.4.5.5-1 and Table 6.6.4.5.5-2 do not apply
for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency
range of a downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1). The current state-of-
the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location
with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling
loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used.
These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [11].
NOTE 2: The table above assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 5.3-1
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not
covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
operating band can transmit without special co-locations requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations, special co-location requirements may apply that
are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability
The transmit intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements
caused by presence of the own transmit signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter via the antenna. The requirement applies during the
transmitter ON period and the transmitter transient period.
The transmit intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an E-UTRA signal of channel bandwidth 5 MHz as an interfering
signal is injected into an antenna connector at a mean power level of 30 dB
lower than that of the mean power of the wanted signal.
The interfering signal centre frequency offset from the wanted signal carrier
centre frequency shall be as in Table 6.7.1-1.
Table 6.7.1-1 Interfering signal centre frequency offset from wanted signal
carrier centre frequency
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +----------------------------------------+----------------------------+ | Interfering signal centre frequency | -BW~Channel~ /2 - 12.5 MHz | | offset from wanted signal carrier | | | centre frequency | -BW~Channel~ /2 - 7.5 MHz | | | | | | -BW~Channel~ /2 - 2.5 MHz | | | | | | BW~Channel~ /2 + 2.5 MHz | | | | | | BW~Channel~ /2 + 7.5 MHz | | | | | | BW~Channel~ /2 + 12.5 MHz | +----------------------------------------+----------------------------+ | NOTE 1: Interfering signal positions | | | that are partially or completely | | | outside of the downlink operating band | | | of the base station are excluded from | | | the requirement, unless the | | | interfering signal positions fall | | | within the frequency range of adjacent | | | downlink operating bands in the same | | | geographical area. | | | | | | NOTE 2: NOTE 1 is not applied in Band | | | 1, 3, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 34 in | | | certain regions. | | +----------------------------------------+----------------------------+
The wanted signal channel bandwidth BW~Channel~ shall be the maximum channel
bandwidth supported by the base station.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.
In case that none of the interfering signal positions according to the
conditions of Table 6.7.1-1 is applicable, a wanted signal channel bandwidth
BW~Channel~ less than the maximum channel bandwidth supported by the base
station shall be selected so that at least one applicable interfering signal
position according to Table 6.7.1-1 is obtained. If the BS does not support
any channel bandwidths less than the maximum supported bandwidth, an
interfering signal outside or partly outside the downlink operating band shall
used.
### 6.7.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 6.7.1.
### 6.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in its non linear elements caused
by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna to below specified levels.
### 6.7.4 Method of test
#### 6.7.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex D.2.
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 4.7.
Connect the signal analyzer to the base station RF output port as shown in
Annex I.1.2.
#### 6.7.4.2 Procedures
1) Generate the wanted signal according to E-TM1.1 at specified maximum output
power, Pmax.
2) Generate the interfering signal according to E-TM1.1, with 5 MHz channel
bandwidth and a centre frequency offset according to the conditions of Table
6.7.1-1.
3) Adjust ATT1 so that level of the E-UTRA modulated interfering signal is as
defined in subclause 6.7.5.
4) Perform the Out-of-band emission tests as specified in subclauses 6.6.2 and
6.6.3, for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which appear in
the frequency ranges defined in subclauses 6.6.2 and 6.6.3. The width of the
intermodulation products shall be taken into account.
5) Perform the Transmitter spurious emissions test as specified in subclause
6.6.4, for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which appear in
the frequency ranges defined in subclause 6.6.4. The width of the
intermodulation products shall be taken into account.
6) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level with the
exception of interfering signal frequencies.
7) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre frequency
offset s according to the conditions of Table 6.7.1-1.
NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2 and
2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at 3F1±2F2,
3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the wanted signal centre
frequency and F2 represents the interfering signal centre frequency.\ The
width of intermodulation products are
  * (n*BW~Channel~ + m*5MHz) for the nF1±mF2 products
  * (n*5MHz + m*BW~Channel~) for the nF2±mF1 products
### 6.7.5 Test Requirements
In the frequency range relevant for this test, the transmit intermodulation
level shall not exceed the out-of-band emission requirements of subclauses
6.6.2 and 6.6.3 and transmitter spurious emissions requirements of subclause
6.6.4 in the presence of a E-UTRA modulated interfering signal with a mean
power 30 dB below the mean power of the wanted signal.
The measurements for out-of-band emissions and spurious emission requirements
due to intermodulation can be limited to the frequency ranges of all third and
fifth order intermodulation products, excluding the channel bandwidths of the
wanted and interfering signals.
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in Annex G. The explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex G.

The blocking performance requirement applies as specified in the Tables 7.6-1,
7.6-1a, 7.6-1x and 7.6-2 in clause 7.6.5.
### 7.6.2 Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 7.6.1.
### 7.6.3 Test purpose
The test stresses the ability of the BS receiver to withstand high-level
interference from unwanted signals at specified frequency offsets without
undue degradation of its sensitivity.
### 7.6.4 Method of test
#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M see subclause 4.7. The BS shall be configured to
operate as close to the centre of the operating band (see Table 5.5-1) as
possible.
Channel bandwidths to be tested:
> a) In the interferer frequency range (F~UL_low~ -20) MHz to (F~UL_high~ +20)
> MHz the requirement shall be tested with the lowest and the highest
> bandwidth supported by the BS.
>
> b) In the interferer frequency ranges 1 MHz to (F~UL_low~ -20) MHz and
> (F~UL_high~ +20) MHz to 12750 MHz the requirement shall be tested only with
> the lowest bandwidth supported by the BS.
>
> 1) Connect the signal generator for the wanted signal and the signal
> generator for the interfering signal to the antenna connector of one Rx port
> as shown in Annex I.2.5.
2) Terminate any other Rx port not under test.
3) Start to transmit according to reference measurement channel in annex A.1
to the BS under test. The level of the wanted signal measured at the BS
antenna connector shall be set to the level specified in subclause 7.6.5.
#### 7.6.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals, levels and
the frequency offsets as specified in Tables 7.6-1, 7.6-2 and 7.6-3 for Wide
Area BS and in Tables 7.6-1a, 7.6-2 and 7.6-4 for Local Area BS. The E-UTRA
interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz starting from the
minimum offset to the channel edges of the wanted signal as specified in Table
7.6-2. The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz
within the range specified in Table 7.6-1 and 7.6-3 for Wide Area BS and in
Table 7.6-1a and 7.6-4 for Local Area BS.
2) Measure the throughput of the wanted signal at the BS receiver according to
Annex E.
3) Interchange the connections of the BS Rx ports and repeat the measurements
according to steps (1) to (2).
### 7.6.5 Test Requirements
#### 7.6.5.1 General requirement
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS
antenna input using the parameters in Table 7.6-1, 7.6-1a, 7.6-1x and 7.6-2.
The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
Tables 7.2-1 and 7.2-2 for each channel bandwidth and further specified in

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The relationship between
Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements is defined in subclause 4.1 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex G.
#### 7.6.5.2 Co-location with other base stations
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of
E-UTRA BS receivers when GSM, CMDA, UTRA or E-UTRA BS operating in a different
frequency band are co-located with an E-UTRA BS. The requirement is applicable
to all channel bandwidths supported by the E-UTRA BS.
The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and E-UTRA BS receiver and are based on co-location
with base stations of the same class.
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS
antenna input using the parameters in Table 7.6-3 for Wide Area BS and 7.6-4
for Local Area BS. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in Tables 7.2-1 and 7.2-2 for each channel bandwidth and further
specified in Annex A.
Table 7.6-3: Blocking performance requirement for E-UTRA Wide Area BS when co-
located with BS in other frequency bands.

## 7.7 Receiver spurious emissions
### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability
The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or amplified
in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna connector. The
requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX antenna ports. The test
shall be performed when both TX and RX are on, with the TX port terminated.
For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the
transmitter spurious emission as specified in clause 6.6.4 is valid.
### 7.7.2 Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 7.7.1.
### 7.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to limit the interference
caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.
### 7.7.4 Method of test
#### 7.7.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M, see subclause 4.7.
1) Connect a measurement receiver to the BS antenna connector as shown in
Annex I.2.6.
2) Enable the BS receiver.
3) Terminate the BS Tx antenna connector as shown in Annex I.2.6.
#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure
1) Start BS transmission according to E-TM 1.1 at Pmax.
2) Set measurement equipment parameters as specified in table 7.7-1.
3) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described in
subclause 7.7.5.
4) Repeat the test using diversity antenna connector if available.
### 7.7.5 Test requirements
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table 7.7-1.
In addition to the requirements in Table 7.7-1, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the levels specified for Protection of the E-UTRA
FDD BS receiver of own or different BS in Clause 6.6.4.5.3 and for Co-
existence with other systems in the same geographical area in Clause
6.6.4.5.4. In addition, the co-existence requirements for co-located base
stations specified in subclause 6.6.4.5.5 may also be applied.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The relationship between
Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements is defined in subclause 4.1 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex G.
## 7.8 Receiver intermodulation
### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA signal as
specified in Annex C.
### 7.8.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 7.8.1.
### 7.8.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to inhibit the
generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements caused by
the presence of two high-level interfering signals at frequencies with a
specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted signal.
### 7.8.4 Method of test
#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 4.7.
1) Set-up the measurement system as shown in Annex I.2.7.
#### 7.8.4.2 Procedures
1) Generate the wanted signal and adjust the signal level to the BS under test
to the level specified in Table 7.8-1.
2) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals, levels and
the frequency offsets as specified in Table 7.8-2 for intermodulation
requirement and Table 7.8-3, Table 7.8-4 and Table 7.8-x for narrowband
intermodulation requirement.
3) Adjust the signal generators to obtain the specified level of interfering
signal at the BS input.
4) Measure the throughput according to Annex E.
5) Repeat the whole test for the port which was terminated.
### 7.8.5 Test requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency
and two interfering signals with the conditions specified in Table 7.8-1 and
Table 7.8-2 for intermodulation performance and in Table 7.8-3, Table 7.8-4
and Table 7.8-x for narrowband intermodulation performance.. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in Table 7.2-1,
Table7.2-2 and Table 7.2-x for each channel bandwidth and further specified in
Annex A.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The relationship between
Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements is defined in subclause 4.1 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex G.
# 8 Performance requirement
## 8.1 General
Performance requirements are specified for a number of test environments and
multipath channel classes.
The requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are supported
by the base station.
The performance requirements for High Speed Train conditions defined in Annex
B.3 are optional.
The performance requirements for UL timing adjustment scenario 2 defined in
Annex B.4 are optional.
For BS with receiver antenna diversity the required SNR shall be applied
separately at each antenna port.
In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may be
provided, from the base station to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.
## 8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
### 8.2.1 Performance requirements of PUSCH in multipath fading propagation
conditions
#### 8.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.
A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS supports
it.
For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the tests for the lowest
and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.
#### 8.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.2.1.1.
#### 8.2.1.3 Test Purpose
The test shall verify the receiver's ability to achieve throughput under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
#### 8.2.1.4 Method of test
##### 8.2.1.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M; see subclause 4.7.
1) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.2.
##### 8.2.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth, defined in
Table 8.2.1.4.2-1.
Table 8.2.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input
* * *
Channel bandwidth [MHz] AWGN power level 1.4 -92.7dBm / 1.08MHz 3 -88.7dBm /
2.7MHz 5 -86.5dBm / 4.5MHz 10 -83.5dBm / 9MHz 15 -81.7dBm / 13.5MHz 20
-80.4dBm / 18MHz
* * *
> 2) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
> the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and
> the test parameters in Table 8.2.1.4.2-2. For reference channels using 1
> resource block the resource block in the middle of the channel bandwidth
> shall be used. In case the number of resource blocks in the channel
> bandwidth are even the one in the middle with lower number is to be used for
> testing.
Table 8.2.1.4.2-2 Test parameters for testing PUSCH
* * *
Parameter Value Maximum number of HARQ transmissions 4 RV sequence 0, 2, 3, 1,
0, 2, 3, 1 Uplink-downlink allocation for TDD Configuration 1 (2:2)
* * *
3) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex B.
4) Adjust the equipment so that required SNR specified in Table 8.2.1.5-1 to
8.2.1.5-6 is achieved at the BS input.
5) For each of the reference channels in Table 8.2.1.5-1 to 8.2.1.5-6
applicable for the base station, measure the throughput, according to annex E.
#### 8.2.1.5 Test Requirement
The throughput measured according to subclause 8.2.1.4.2 shall not be below
the limits for the SNR levels specified in Table 8.2.1.5-1 to 8.2.1.5-6..

### 8.2.2 Performance requirements for UL timing adjustment
#### 8.2.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput measured for the moving UE at given SNR. The required throughput is
expressed as 70% of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.
In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one being
transmitted by moving UE and the other being transmitted by stationary UE. The
transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC parameters in Table A.7-1 and
Table A.8-1 are applied for both UEs. The received power for both UEs is the
same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are consecutive. In Scenario
2, Doppler shift is not taken into account.
A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS supports
it.
For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the tests for the lowest
and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.
This requirement shall not be applied to Local Area BS and Home BS.
#### 8.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.2.2.1.
#### 8.2.2.3 Test Purpose

the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in subclause 4.1 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex G.
### 8.2.3 Performance requirements for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH
#### 8.2.3.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH is determined by
the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK and the
probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the required
SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less at PUSCH power settings presented
in table 8.2.3.5-1.
The probability of detection of ACK on PUSCH is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the ACK is transmitted on PUSCH
allocated RE.
The probability of false detection of the ACK on PUSCH is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when data only is
sent on PUSCH allocated RE, where HARQ-ACK can be allocated (i.e. by
puncturing data). Pseudo‑random data shall be used as an input for PUSCH
coding and modulation purposes.
These tests shall be performed on one of RE's, where HARQ-ACK information was
multiplexed on PUSCH.
In the test for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH data is punctured by HARQ-ACK
information in both slots within a subframe on symbols as specified in 36.212
[13] subclause 5.2.2.8. Amount of resources for HARQ-ACK information is
calculated according to 36.212 [13] subclause 5.2.2.6. None of CQI, RI nor SRS
is to be transmitted in these tests. Tests are performed for one bit HARQ-ACK
information (O = 1).
This test is applied for QPSK 1/3 and 16QAM 3/4 modulation and coding schemes,
with appropriate fixed reference channels for performance requirement applied
as presented in table 8.2.3.5-1. Normal CP, 2 Rx antennas and ETU70
propagation conditions shall be used for this test.
A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS supports
it.
For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the tests for the lowest
and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.
#### 8.2.3.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.2.4.1.
#### 8.2.3.3 Test Purpose
The test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect HARQ-ACK information
multiplexed on PUSCH under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given
SNR.
#### 8.2.3.4 Method of test
##### 8.2.3.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M; see subclause 4.7.
1) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.2.
##### 8.2.3.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth, defined in
Table 8.2.3.4.2-1.
Table 8.2.3.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input
* * *
Channel bandwidth [MHz] AWGN power level 1.4 -92.7 dBm / 1.08MHz 3 -88.7 dBm /
2.7MHz 5 -86.5 dBm / 4.5MHz 10 -83.5 dBm / 9MHz 15 -81.7 dBm / 13.5MHz 20
-80.4 dBm / 18MHz
* * *
2) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in Annex A and
details presented in chapter 8.2.3.1. For reference channels using 1 resource
block the RB in the middle of the channel bandwidth should be used. In case
the number of resource blocks in the channel bandwidth are even the one in the
middle with lower number is to be used for testing.
3) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to ETU70
channel model defined in Annex B.2.
4) Adjust the equipment so that required SNR specified in Table 8.2.3.5-1 is
achieved at the BS input during the ACK transmissions.
5) The signal generator sends a test pattern on one of RE's where HARQ-ACK
information can be multiplexed on PUSCH with the pattern outlined in figure
8.2.3.4.2-1. The following statistics are kept: the number of ACKs detected
during data only transmissions and the number of missed ACKs during PUSCH with
ACK transmission.

demodulation tests
#### 8.2.3.5 Test Requirement
The fraction of falsely detected ACKs measured according to subclause
8.2.3.4.2 shall be less than 1% and the fraction of correctly detected ACKs

### 8.3.3 ACK missed detection for multi user PUCCH format 1a
#### 8.3.3.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of multi user PUCCH for ACK missed detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the probability of detection of ACK on the wanted signal. The performance
is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The
probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less. These
probabilities are measured on the wanted signal at presence of three
interfering signals as specified in section 8.3.3.4.2.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise and the
interfering signals are present.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.
The test is applicable to all BS. A test for a specific channel bandwidth is
only applicable if the BS supports it.
For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the tests for the lowest
and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.
Multi user PUCCH test is performed only for 2 Rx antennas, Normal CP and for
ETU70 propagation conditions.
ACK/NAK repetitions are disabled for PUCCH transmission.

##### 8.3.3.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M; see subclause 4.7.
1) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted and all interfering signals,
multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to both BS antenna connectors
for 2Rx diversity reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.3.
2) Interconnect attenuators for relative power setting purposes for all
transmitting branches (wanted signal and all interferers, separately).
##### 8.3.3.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth defined in
Table 8.3.3.4.2-1.
Table 8.3.3.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input
* * *
Channel bandwidth [MHz] AWGN power level 1.4 -89.7 dBm / 1.08MHz 3 -85.7 dBm /

-77.4 dBm / 18MHz
* * *
2) In multi user PUCCH test, four signals are configured: one wanted signal
and three interferers, which are transmitted via separate fading paths using
relative power settings presented in Annex A.9.
All signals are transmitted on the same PUCCH resources, with different PUCCH
channel indices, as presented in Annex A.9.
> The characteristics of the all signals (i.e. wanted and all interferers)
> shall be configured according to 36.211 [12].
3) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to ETU70
propagation conditions defined in Annex B.
4) Adjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in Table 8.3.3.5-1 is
achieved at the BS input during the ACK transmissions on the wanted signal.
5) The signal generator sends a test pattern with the pattern outlined in
figure 8.3.3.4.2-1. This statement is valid for all signals, i.e. wanted and
all interferers. The following statistics are kept: the number of ACKs
detected in the idle periods and the number of missed ACKs on the wanted PUCCH
signal.

## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
### 8.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection
#### 8.4.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by
the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa)
and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured
by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1%
or less.
Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of
the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only
noise.
Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the
signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases --
detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not detecting a
preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong timing
estimation. For AWGN, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error
of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 1.04us. For ETU70, a timing
estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest
path is larger than 2.08us. The strongest path for the timing estimation error
refers to the strongest path (i.e. average of the delay of all paths having
the same highest gain = 310ns for ETU) in the power delay profile.
The normal mode test is applicable to all BS. The high speed mode test is
applicable to high speed BS.
#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.4.1.1 and 8.4.2.1.
#### 8.4.1.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect PRACH preamble under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
#### 8.4.1.4 Method of test
##### 8.4.1.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M; see subclause 4.7
1) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.1 or Annex I.3.2 as
applicable.
##### 8.4.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth.
Table 8.4.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input
* * *
Channel bandwidth [MHz] AWGN power level 1.4 -89.7 dBm / 1.08MHz 3 -85.7 dBm /
2.7MHz 5 -83.5 dBm / 4.5MHz 10 -80.5 dBm / 9MHz 15 -78.7 dBm / 13.5MHz 20
-77.4 dBm / 18MHz
* * *
2) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in Annex A.
3) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in Annex B.
4) Adjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to Table 8.4.1.5-1
or 8.4.1.5-2.
5) Adjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in Table 8.4.1.5-1 or
8.4.1.5-2 is achieved at the BS input during the PRACH preambles.
6) The test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries to detect
the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.4.1.4.2-1.
The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described below. The
following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in the idle
period and the number of missed preambles.
Figure 8.4.1.4.2-1 PRACH preamble test pattern
The timing offset base value is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased
within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the
tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing
offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing offset scheme is presented in
Figure 8.4.1.4.2-2.

A multipath fading propagation condition is defined by a combination of a
multi-path delay profile and a maximum Doppler frequency _f~D~_ which is
either 5, 70 or 300 Hz. In addidion, 200 Hz Doppler frequency is specified for
UL timing adjustment performance requirement.
## B.3 High speed train condition
High speed train conditions are as follows:
> Scenario 1: Open space
>
> Scenario 3: Tunnel for multi-antennas
The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance are
two non-fading propagation channels in both scenarios. For BS with Rx
diversity defined in scenario 1, the Doppler shift variation is the same
between antennas.
Doppler shift for both scenarios is given by:
$f_{s}\left( t \right) = f_{d}\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right)$ (B.3.1)
where $f_{s}\left( t \right)$ is the Doppler shift and $f_{d}$ is the maximum
Doppler frequency. The cosine of angle $\theta\left( t \right)$ is given by:
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{D_{s}/2 -
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( D_{s}/2 - \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $0 \leq t \leq D_{s}/v$ (B.3.2)
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{- 1\text{.}5D_{s} +
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( - 1\text{.}5D_{s} + \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $D_{s}/v  2D_{s}/v$ (B.3.4)
where $D_{s}/2$ is the initial distance of the train from BS, and
$D_{\text{min}}$ is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters; $v$ is the
velocity of the train in m/s, $t$ is time in seconds.
Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equations B.3.1 and B.3.2-B.3.4
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in Table B.3-1 and
the resulting Doppler shift is shown in Figure B.3-1 and B.3-2 are applied for
all frequency bands.

# B.4 Moving propagation conditions
Figure B.4-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test of the
UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the reference
timing and the first tap is according Equation (B.4-1). The timing difference
between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ - (_T~A~_ −31)×16 _T~s~_.
The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving
propagation conditions are shown in Table B.4-1.

###### ## Annex E (normative): General rules for statistical testing
\
###### ## Annex F (normative): Global In-Channel TX-Test
# F.1 General
The global in-channel Tx test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of the TX
under test in a single measurement process.
The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter, however,
are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for description inside
this annex places particular emphasis on the exclusion of all
interdependencies among the parameters.
## F.2.1 Basic principle
The process is based on the comparison of the actual **output signal of the TX
under test** , received by an ideal receiver, with a **reference signal** ,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error
free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent (generally
complex) baseband signals.
The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples. These
numbers are taken from frame structure 1 with normal CP length and a
transmission bandwidth configuration of _N_ ~RB~ = 100. The application of the
text below, however, is not restricted to this parameterset.
## F.2.2 Output signal of the TX under test
The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring equipment
and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at a sampling rate of 30.72
Msps and it is named z(ν). In the time domain it comprises at least 1 frame::
z(ν). It is modelled as a signal with the following parameters: demodulated
data content, carrier frequency, amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
## F.2.3 Reference signal
Two types of reference signal are defined:
The reference signal i~1~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following parameters:
demodulated data content, nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and
phase for each subcarrier. It is represented as a sequence of samples at a
sampling rate of 30.72 Msps in the time domain. The structure of the signal is
described in the testmodells.
The reference signal i~2~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following parameters:
restricted data content: nominal Reference Symbols and the Primary
Synchronisation Channel, (all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),
nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable
subcarrier, nominal timing. It is represented as a sequence of samples at a
sampling rate of 30.72 Msps in the time domain.
## F.2.4 Measurement results
The measurement results, achieved by the global in channel TX test are the
following:
  * Carrier Frequency error
  * EVM (Error Vector Magnitude)
  * Resource Element TX power
    * RS TX power (RSTP)
    * OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP)
> Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX
> chain after equalisation.
## F.2.5 Measurement points
Resource element TX power is measured after the FFT as described below. EVM is
calculated after the Equalizer (Ampl./ Phase correction). The result of the
frequency synchronisation is the frequency offset. It is performed in the pre-
and/or post-FFT domain. The FFT window of 2048 samples out of 2194 samples
(data +CP) in the time domain is selected in the box CP removal.
Figure E.2.5-1: Measurement points
## F.3.1 Pre FFT minimization process
**Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency** in z(ν) are varied in order to minimise
the difference between z(ν) and i~1~ (ν) , after the amplitude ratio of z(ν)
and i~1~ (ν) has been scaled. Best fit (minimum difference) is achieved when
the RMS difference value between z(ν) and i(ν) is an absolute minimum.
The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: Carrier Frequency
Error.
From the acquired samples one carrier frequency error can be derived.
Note 1. The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be supported by
Post FFT operations. However the minimisation process defined in the pre FFT
domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it does not exclude the samples
inbetween the FFT widths and it does not exclude the bandwidth outside the
transmission bandwidth configuration.
Note 2. The algorithm would allow to derive Carrier Frequency error and Sample
Frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there are no
requirements for Sample Frequeny error. Hence the algorithm models the RF and
the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It returns one error and
does not distinuish between both.
After this process the samples z(ν) are called z^0^(ν).
## F.3.2 Timing of the FFT window
The FFT window length is 2048 samples per OFDM symbol. 140 FFTs (286720
samples) cover less than the acquired number of samples (30720 samples in 10
subframes) The position in time for FFT must be determined.
In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic prefix
without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the window. The EVM
requirements shall be met within a window W\ The meaning of "impulse response" assumes that the autocorrelation of the
> reference signal i~2~(ν) is a Dirac peak and that the correlation between
> the reference signal i~2~(ν) and the data in the measured signal is 0. The
> correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one highest, the
> earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.
The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to z^0^(ν). This
subset of samples is called z'(ν).
From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.
The timing of the centre $\Delta\overset{\sim}{c}$ with respect to the
different CP length in a slot is as follows: (Frame structure 1, normal CP
length)
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{c}$ is on T~f~=72 within the CP of length 144 (in OFDM
symbol 1 to 6)
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{c}$ is on T~f~=88 (=160-72) within the CP of length 160
(in OFDM symbol 0)
## F.3.3 Resource Element TX power
Perform FFT (z'(ν)) with the FFT window timing$\Delta\overset{\sim}{c}$
The result is called Z'(t,f). The RE TX power is then defined as:
From this the Reference Signal Transmit power (RSTP) is derives as follows:
$\begin{matrix} \sum_{\text{within}\ \text{subframe}}^{}\text{RS}\ \text{RE}\
\text{locations}\ \ \end{matrix}$,
It is an average power and accumulates the powers of the reference symbols
within a sub frame divided by n, the number of reference symbols within a sub
frame.
From RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:
It accumulates all sub carrier powers of the 4th OFDM symbol. The 4th (out of
14 OFDM symbols within a subframe (in case of frame type 1 , normal CP
length)) contains exclusively PDSCH.
From the acquired samples 10 values for each RSTP and OSTP can be derived.
## F.3.4 Post FFT equalisation
Perform 140 FFTs on z'(ν), one for each OFDM symbol comprising the full frame
with the FFT window timing$\Delta\overset{\sim}{c}$. (in case of frame type 1
, normal CP length) The result is an array of samples, 140 in the time axis t
times 2048 in the frequency axis f.
The equalizer coefficients $\overset{\sim}{a}(f)$and $\overset{\sim}{\phi}(f)$
are determined as follows:
1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal $Z'(t,f)$ and the post-FFT Ideal signal $I_{2}(t,f)$, for each
reference symbol, over 10 subframes. This process creates a set of complex
ratios
2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the complex
ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 subframes. Prior to the averaging of
the phases $\phi\left( t_{i},f \right)$ an unwrap operation must be performed
according to the following definition: The unwrap operation corrects the
radian phase angles of $\phi\left( t_{i},f \right)$ by adding multiples of
2*PI when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances t~i~ are
greater then or equal to the jump tolerance of PI radians. This process
creates an average amplitude and phase for each reference signal subcarrier
(i.e. every third subcarrier with the exception of the reference subcarrier
spacing across the DC subcarrier).
Where _N_ is the number of reference symbol time-domain locations _t~i~_ from
Z'(f,t) for each reference signal subcarrier $f$.
3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase $\hat{a}(f)$ and
$\hat{\phi}(f)$ at the reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing
the moving average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged reference
signal subcarriers, i.e. every third subcarrier. The moving average window
size is 19. For reference subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel the
window size is reduced accordingly as per figure F. 3.4.
4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients $\hat{a}(f)$
and $\hat{\phi}(f)$ to compute coefficients $\overset{\sim}{a}(f)$,
$\overset{\sim}{\phi}(f)$ for each subcarrier.
The equalized samples are called Z'~eq~(f,t).
Figure F.3.4-1: Reference subcarrier smoothing in the frequency domain
## F.4.1 EVM
For EVM create two sets of Z'~eq~(f,t)., according to the timing "ΔC \--W/2
and ΔC +W/2", using the equalizer coefficients from F.3.4.
The equivalent ideal samples are calculated form i~1~(ν) (clause F.2.3) and
are called I(f,t).
The EVM is the difference between the ideal waveform and the measured and
equalized waveform.
$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t \in T}^{}\sum_{f \in F(t)}^{}\left|
Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( f,t \right) - I\left( f,t \right) \right|^{2}}{\sum_{t
\in T}^{}\sum_{f \in F(t)}^{}\left| I\left( f,t \right) \right|^{2}}}$,
where
$T$ is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active
within the subframe,
$F(t)$is the set of subcarriers within the $N_{\text{SC}}^{\text{RB}}$
resource blocks with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol
_t_ ,
$I(t,f)$ _is_ the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in
accordance with relevant Test models,
$Z'_{\text{eq}}(t,f)$ is the equalized signal under test.
Note1: Although the basic unit of measurement is one subframe, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 subframes measurement period to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference symbols.
Note 2: Applicability of EVM calculation:
One EVM value is associated to 12 subcarriers times 1 subframe = pair of 2 RBs
= 168 resource elements.
But only a reduced number of REs in this pair of 2 RBs contribute to EVM.
Those are the PDSCH REs, containing the considered modulation scheme. Only
those pairs of 2 RBs are evaluated with respect to EVM, which contain the
maximum number of PDSCH REs. (EVM-relevant location in the time/frequency grid
) The others are not evaluated.
In specific:
For bandwidth 1.4 MHz:
Only the pairs of 2 RBs containing 138 PDSCH REs are used for EVM. Only those
138 REs contribute to EVM
All pairs of 2 RBs, which contain less than 138 PDSCH REs, are not evaluated
with respect to EVM.
For all other Bandwidths:
Only the pairs of 2 RBs containing 150 PDSCH REs are used for EVM. Only those
150 REs contribute to EVM
All pairs of 2 RBs, which contain less than 150 PDSCH REs, are not evaluated
with respect to EVM.
This restriction serves to avoid weighted averaging in F.4.2.
## F.4.2 Averaged EVM
EVM is averaged over all allocated EVM relevant locations in the frequency
domain, and 10 consecutive downlink subframes (10 ms):
(The locations in the time-frequency grid are occupied irregularly, see Fig
F.4.2-1)
$\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is derived by: square the EVM resultsin F.4.1, sum the
squares over all EVM relevant locations in the time/frequency grid, divide the
sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient.
The EVM requirements should be tested against the maximum of the average EVM
at the window W extremities of the EVM measurements:
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{l}$ is calculated using
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t} = \Delta{\overset{\sim}{t}}_{l}$in the expressions
above and ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{h}$is calculated using
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t} = \Delta{\overset{\sim}{t}}_{h}$. (l and h, low and
high. Where l is the timing ΔC --W/2 and and high is the timing ΔC +W/2)
Thus we get:
For TDD special fields (DwPTS and GP) are not included in the averaging.

### F.4.2.1 Averaged EVM (TDD)
For TDD the averaging in the time domain can be calculated from subframes of
different frames and should have a minimum of 10 subframes averaging length.
TDD special fields (DwPTS and GP) are not included in the averaging.
$\overline{\text{EVM}}$~frame~ is derived by: Square the EVM results in a
frame. Relevant for EVM are subframes in a frame, which are active in the DL,
_Ndl_. Within these subframes, those RBs are relevant, that carry the maximum
number of PDSCH REs (same as FDD). Sum the squares, divide the sum by the
number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient. (RMS)
The EVM~frame~ is calculated, using the maximum of
$\overline{\text{EVM}}$~frame~ at the window W extremities. Thus
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t} = \Delta{\overset{\sim}{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$is calculated using
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t} = \Delta{\overset{\sim}{t}}_{h}$. (l and h, low and
high. Where l is the timing ΔC --W/2 and and high is the timing ΔC +W/2)
In order to unite at least 10 subframes, consider the minimum integer number
of radio frames, containing at least 10 EVM relevant subframes. Unite by RMS.
$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k =
1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$, $N_{\text{frame}} =
\left\lceil \frac{\text{10}}{N_{\text{dl}}} \right\rceil$
The result, $\overline{\text{EVM}}$, is compared against the limit.
###### ## Annex G (informative): Test Tolerances and Derivation of Test
Requirements
The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by relaxing
the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the Test Tolerances
defined here. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the Test Requirement will be
the same as the Minimum Requirement. When the Test Tolerance is non-zero, the
Test Requirements will differ from the Minimum Requirements, and the formula
used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.
The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test
Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.
The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where
the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2. In
this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test
tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened Test Requirements as
defined in this Annex.
[FFS: For example, a Test System having 0.9 dB uncertainty for test 6.2 Base
Station maximum output power (which is 0.2 dB above the limit specified in
clause 4.1.2) would subtract 0.2 dB from the Test Tolerance of 0.7 dB defined
in this Annex. This new test tolerance of 0.5 dB would then be applied to the
Minimum Requirement using the formula defined in Table G.2-1 to give a new
range of ±2.5 dB of the manufacturer\'s rated output power.
Using this same approach for the case where a test had a test tolerance of 0
dB, an excess error of 0.2 dB would result in a modified test tolerance of
-0.2 dB.]

###### ## Annex J (Informative): Unwanted emission requirements for multi-
carrier BS
# J.1 General
In section 6.6, unwanted emission requirements for single carrier or multi-
carrier BS are specified. This multi-carrier BS corresponds to a multi-carrier
BS of the same channel bandwidth for E-UTRA. The following two pragmatic
scenarios are considered in this annex:
\- multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths, covering only 5
MHz and higher channel bandwidths\ \- multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA,
covering only 5 MHz and higher E-UTRA channel bandwidths.
All scenarios for channel bandwidths less than 5 MHz are for further study.
Only multi-carrier BS with contiguous carriers are considered. The guidelines
below assumes that the power spectral density of the multiple carriers is the
same. All other combinations of multiple carriers are ffs.
Note 1: Further information and analysis for these scenarios can be found in
TR 36.942 [14].
# J.2 Multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths
For a multi-carrier E-UTRA BS transmitting a group of carriers of different
channel bandwidths (≥5 MHz), the channel bandwidth of the outermost carriers
should be considered for ACLR and Operating band unwanted emission
requirements. That is, the corresponding requirements for the channel
bandwidth of each of the outermost carriers should be applied at the
respective side of the group of transmitted carriers.
# J.3 Multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA
For a multi-carrier BS transmitting a group of carriers of E-UTRA (channel
bandwidth(s) ≥5 MHz) and UTRA, the RAT being used on the outermost carriers
should be considered for ACLR and Operating band unwanted emission
requirements. That is, the corresponding requirements for the RAT being used
on each of the outermost carriers should be applied at the respective side of
the group of transmitted carriers.
