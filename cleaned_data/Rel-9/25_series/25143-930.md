# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and the
donor base station.
**Down-link:** signal path where base station transmits and mobile receives
**Maximum output power, Pmax:** This is the mean power level per carrier
measured at the antenna connector of the Repeater in specified reference
condition.
**Pass band:** the Repeater can have one or several pass bands. The pass band
is the frequency range that the Repeater operates in with operational
configuration. This frequency range can correspond to one or several
consecutive nominal 5 MHz channels. If they are not consecutive each subset of
channels shall be considered as an individual pass band.
**Repeater:** a device that receives, amplifies and transmits the radiated or
conducted RF carrier both in the down-link direction (from the base station to
the mobile area) and in the up-link direction (from the mobile to the base
station).
**Up-link:** signal path where mobile transmits and base station receives.

b) Deployment in other frequency bands is not precluded.
## 4.2 TX -- RX frequency separation
a) A UTRA/FDD repeaters is designed to operate with the following TX to RX
frequency separation
Table 4.2: TX-RX frequency separation
* * *
Operating Band TX-RX frequency separation I 190 MHz II 80 MHz III 95 MHz IV
400 MHz V 45 MHz VI 45 MHz VII 120 MHz VIII 45 MHz IX 95 MHz X 400 MHz XI 48
MHz XII 30 MHz XIII 31 MHz XIV 30 MHz XIX 45 MHz XX 41 MHz XXI 48 MHz
* * *
b) A UTRA/FDD Repeater can support both fixed and variable up-link to down-
link frequency separation.
c) The use of other up-link to down-link frequency separations in existing or
other frequency bands shall not be precluded.
## 4.3 Channel arrangement
### 4.3.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 4.3.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a number of
additional centre frequencies are specified according to the table 4.4, which
means that the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
### 4.3.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN).
For each operating band, the UARFCN values are defined as follows.
Uplink: N~U~ = 5 * (F~UL~ -- F~UL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~UL_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤ F~UL_high~
Downlink: N~D~ = 5 * (F~DL~ -- F~DL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~DL_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤ F~DL_high~
For each operating Band, F~UL_Offset~, F~UL_low~, F~UL_high~, F~DL_Offset~,,
F~DL_low~ and F~DL_high~ are defined in Table 4.3 for the general UARFCN. For
the additional UARFCN, F~UL_Offset~, F~DL_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and
F~DL~ are defined in Table 4.4.

# 5 General test conditions and declarations
This specification applies only to UTRA/FDD Repeater.
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification. Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter
relative to a value, that is not fully specified in the UTRA specifications.
For these tests, the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal
value specified by the manufacturer.
Some requirements for the Repeater may be regional as listed in subclause 5.6.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported.
Schematic drawings for the individual measurement set-up can be found in the
Annex.
## 5.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the stimulus
signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance, and
the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the
specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and
are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF test it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 5.1 apply
to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include
system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.
### 5.1.1 Measurements of test environments
The measurement accuracy of the Repeater test environments defined in
Subclause 5.4, Test environments shall be.
> Pressure: ± 5 kPa.
>
> Temperature: ± 2 degrees.
>
> Relative Humidity: ± 5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ± 1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ± 1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

## 5.2 Repeater test tolerances (informative)
The Test Tolerances defined in this subclause have been used to relax the
Minimum Requirements in this specification to derive the Test Requirements.
The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test
Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.
The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.)

## 5.3 Interpretation of measurement results
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -- without
any modification -- against the Test Requirements as defined by the share risk
principle.
The share risk principle is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5.
The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the measurement of
each parameter shall be included in the test report.
The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in subclause 5.1 of
this specification.
If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in subclause 5.1, it is still permitted to use
this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
subclause 5.1 shall be used to tighten the Test Requirement-making the test
harder to pass. (For some tests e.g. receiver test, this may require
modification of stimulus signals). This procedure will ensure that a Test
System not compliant with subclause 5.1does not increase the chance of passing
a device under test where that device would otherwise have failed the test if
a Test System compliant with subclause 5.1 had been used.
## 5.4 Test Environment
For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions under
which the Repeater is to be tested are defined.
### 5.4.1 Normal test environment
When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should be
performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions stated in
Table 5.3.
Table 5.3: Limits of conditions for Normal Test Environment

Condition Minimum Maximum Barometric pressure 86 kPa 106 kPa Temperature 15°C
30°C Relative Humidity 20 % 85 % Power supply Nominal, as declared by the
manufacturer  
Vibration Negligible
* * *
The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent the
maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within the
specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test report.
NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

**Maximum temperature:**
The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 [9].
NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational prior to
the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.
### 5.4.3 Vibration
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under test. This shall use
the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing the required
environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to the test procedure
of IEC 60 068-2-6 [10]. Other environmental conditions shall be within the
ranges specified in subclause 5.4.1.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to
equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should only
vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.
### 5.4.4 Power supply
When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test shall
be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating voltage
defined by manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under test.
**Upper voltage limit:**
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to

Most tests in the present document are only performed for a subset of the
possible combinations of test conditions. For instance:
> \- only one RF channel may be specified to be tested;
>
> \- only one timeslot may be specified to be tested.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.
When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the choice of which combinations
are to be tested may be specified by an operator.

## 5.9 Repeater configurations
### 5.9.1 Power supply options
If the repeater is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the
power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of
conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the
range of conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
### 5.9.2 Combining of Repeaters
If the repeater is intended for combination with additional apparatus
connected to a repeater port and this combination is supplied as a system, the
combination of repeater together with the additional apparatus shall also
fulfil the repeater requirements. E.g. if the repeater is intended for
combination such that multiple repeaters amplify the same signals into the
same ports the combination shall also fulfil the repeater requirements.
An example of such a configuration is shown in figure 5.1

## 8.1 Definitions and applicability
Out of band gain refers to the gain of the Repeater immediately outside the
pass band. The measurements shall apply to both paths uplink and downlink of
the Repeater.
## 8.2 Minimum Requirements
The intended use of a repeater in a system is to amplify the in band signals
and not to amplify the out of band emission of the donor base station.
In the intended application of the repeater, the out of band gain is less than
the donor coupling loss.
The repeater minimum donor coupling loss shall be declared by the
manufacturer. This is this the minimum required attenuation between the donor
BS and the repeater for proper repeater operation.
In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the gain outside the pass
band shall not exceed the maximum level specified in Table 8.1, where:
> \- f_offset is the distance from the centre frequency of the first or last 5
> MHz channel within the pass band.

## 9.2 Spurious emissions
### 9.2.1 Definition and applicability
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter
effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation
products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
This is measured at the Repeater output port.
The requirements of either subclause 9.2.2.1 or subclause 9.2.2.2 shall apply
whatever the type of Repeater considered (one or several pass bands). It
applies for all configurations foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.
The spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the
frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeaters
operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeaters
operating band. Exceptions are the requirement in Table 9.17 and 9.21 that
apply also closer than 10 MHz from repeaters operating band.
Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power (RMS).
For repeaters capable of supporting both UTRA and E-UTRA, conformance to the
UTRA spurious emission requirements can also be demonstrated using E-UTRA
spurious emission test methods as described in TS 36.143 [13].
### 9.2.2 Minimum Requirements
In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the following requirements
shall be met.
#### 9.2.2.1 Spurious emission (Category A)
The following requirements shall be met in cases where Category A limits for
spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [4], are
applied.
At maximum Repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the Repeater,
at levels that produce the maximum rated output power per channel, the power
of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits specified in Table 9.9.
When the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB the requirements shall
still be met.
The requirement shall apply both with or without an input signal applied.

#### 9.2.2.2 Spurious emission (Category B)
The following requirements shall be met in cases where Category B limits for
spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [4], are
applied.
At maximum Repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the Repeater,
at levels that produce the maximum rated power output per channel, the power
of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits specified in Tables 9.10
and 9.10A depending on the declared operating band for the down- and up-link.
When the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB the requirements shall
still be met.

## 10.2 Peak code domain error
In this section the procedure for testing the Peak Code Domain Error of
Repeaters is defined.
### 10.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Peak Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector onto the

code in the domain is defined as the ratio of the mean power of the projection
onto that code, to the mean power of the composite reference waveform. This
ratio is expressed in dB. The Peak Code Domain Error is defined as the maximum
value for the Code Domain Error for all codes. The measurement interval is one
power control group (timeslot).

The Relative Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector (as
defined in 10.1) onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. Only
the active code channels in the composite reference waveform are considered
for this requirement. The Relative Code Domain Error for every active code is
defined as the ratio of the mean power of the error projection onto that code,
to the mean power of the active code in the composite reference waveform. This
ratio is expressed in dB. The measurement interval is one frame.
The requirement for Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for Repeater
supporting 64QAM modulated codes.

error shall not exceed -19.3 dB at spreading factor 16 as defined in TS25.106.
# 11 Input intermodulation
The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the Repeater to
inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the presence of
interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.
## 11.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the Repeater to maintain
the wanted frequency free of internally created interference.
The test requirements in Tables 11.2 may be applied for the protection of FDD
Repeater input when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, E-UTRA FDD and/or UTRA
FDD BS are co-located with a UTRA FDD Repeater.
The additional test requirements in Tables 11.2A may be applied for the
protection of FDD Repeater input when a UTRA TDD BS is co-located with a UTRA
FDD Repeater.
This test applies to uplink and downlink path of the Repeater.

For the parameters specified in table 11.4A, the power in the pass band shall
not increase with more than 11,2 dB at the output of the repeater as measured
in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained without
interfering signals applied.
# 12 Output intermodulation
The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the ability of the
repeater to inhibit the generation of intermodulation products signals created
by the presence of an interfering signal reaching the repeater via the output
port.
## 12.1 Definition and applicability
The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation products
when a WCDMA modulated interference signal is injected into the output port at
a level of 30 dB lower than that of the wanted signal. The frequency of the
interference signal shall be ±5 MHz, ±10 MHz and ±15 MHz offset from the
wanted signal, but within the frequency band allocated for UTRA FDD downlink
as specified in subclause 4.1.
The requirement is applicable for downlink signals.
The normative reference for this requirement is in TS25.106 [12] section 12.
## 12.2 Minimum requirement
In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1, the output intermodulation
level shall not exceed the out of band emission or the spurious emission
requirements of section 9.1 and 9.2.
## 12.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to restrict the
generation of intermodulation products in the presence of a subject signal on
the repeater input and output ports, and an interfering signal applied at the
repeater output port.
## 12.4 Method of test
### 12.4.1 Initial conditions
1) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.
2) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater for tests of
repeaters with a pass band corresponding to one 5 MHz channel. Connect a
signal generator to the circulator on the output port and make sure the signal
generator power is directed to the repeater output port.
3) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 2,515
MHz and 4,0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.
4) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 4,0
MHz and (∆fmax -- 500 kHz) shall use a 1 MHz measurement bandwidth. The 1MHz
measurement bandwidth may be calculated by integrating multiple 50 kHz or
narrower filter measurements
> 5) Detection mode: True RMS.
### 12.4.2 Procedures
1) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.
2) Set the signal generator at the repeater input port (subject signal) to
generate a signal in accordance to test model 1, TS 25.141 subclause 6.1.1.1,
at the level which produce the manufacturer specified maximum output power at
maximum gain.
3) Set the signal generator at the repeater output port (interference signal)
to generate a signal in accordance to test model 1, TS 25.141 subclause
6.1.1.1, at the level producing signal power corresponding to 30 dB below the
manufacturer specified maximum output power at the repeater output port with
the specified frequency offset from the wanted signal.
4) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value. Measurements in the band of the interfering signal shall be
excluded. The measurements can be limited to the power of all third and fifth
order intermodulation products.
5) Repeat from clause 3 until interference signals ±5 MHz, ±10 MHz and ±15 MHz
frequency offset from the wanted signal has been tested. Note that interfering
signals outside the UTRA-FDD allocated frequency band , as specifies in
section 4.1. need not be tested.
## 12.5 Test requirements
In all measurements, the requirements according to sections 9.1.1.5 and the
downlink requirements in section 9.2.2.1 or 9.2.2.2 shall be fulfilled.
# 13 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
## 13.1 Definitions and applicability
Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the RRC weighted gain
per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted gain of the
repeater on an adjacent channel.
The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of Repeater where the
donor link is maintained via antennas (over the air Repeater).
## 13.2 Minimum Requirements
In normal conditions the ACRR shall be higher than the value specified in the
Table 13.1.

subclause 13.1.
## 13.4 Method of test
### 13.4.1 Initial conditions
1) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.
2) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.
3) Connect the power measuring equipment to the Repeater output port.
4) The measurement device characteristics shall be:
\- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in subclause 13.1;
\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.
### 13.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the signal generator to transmit a signal modulated with a combination
of PCCPCH, SCCPCH and Dedicated Physical Channels specified as test model 1 in
TS 25.141 at the first or last 5 MHz channel within the pass band.
2) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain
3) Measure the RRC filtered mean power at the RF output port over a certain
slot.
4) Set the signal generator to transmit the same signal and the same input
power at one of the channel offsets according to Table 13.1.
5) Measure the RRC filtered mean power at the RF output port over a certain
slot.
6) Calculate the ratio of the measured power in the pass band to the measured
power at the channel offset.
7) Repeat step 4) to 6) until all channel offsets in Table 13.1 are measured.
### 13.4.3 Test Requirements
In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1, the ACRR shall be higher
than the value specified in the Table 13.2.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Derivation of Test Requirements
The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by relaxing
the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the Test Tolerances
defined in subclause 5.2. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the Test
Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement. When the Test
Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ from the Minimum
Requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in table B.1.
