# 4 Introduction [1]
An increasing need for 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeBs is observed to provide
attractive services and data rates in home environments in China as a
consequence of a large number of TD-SCDMA subscribers within recent years.
Whereas UTRAN is not optimally suited for this application, as it was
developed and defined under the assumption of coordinated network deployment.
Actually home NodeBs are typically associated with uncoordinated and large
scale deployment.
The aim of this feasibility study is to investigate optimizations and
amendments to the standard in order to fully support the application of
1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeBs.
This study includes but is not limited to the architecture aspect, HO scenario
and interference consideration, etc.
New synchronization mechanism for 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB should be taken into
consideration because there are more stringent synchronization requirements
for 1.28Mcps TDD.
In order to minimize the impact on the existing overall network, the home
NodeB concept for 1.28Mcps TDD shall operate with legacy terminal (from
Release 4 onwards) and core network, and should minimize impact on protocol
interfaces. So far no impact to terminal specifications is foreseen.
Once the feasibility study is finalized, a feasible solution regarding
1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB deployment can be enabled.
## 4.1 Task description [1]
The purpose of this study item is to characterise the 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB
environment and investigate the feasibility of optimisations and amendments to
1.28Mcps TDD mode to adapt it to fully support the Home NodeB.
In order to achieve this, studies should be carried out in at least the
following areas:

> Home NodeB
>
> \- Identify relevant deployment scenarios
● RF-related issues
> \- Investigating RF related aspects such as interference scenarios and
> investigating RF performance requirements for 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB
● Frequency accuracy
> \- How much the frequency accuracy can be relaxed in home environment
● Associated class definitions
> \- Investigate (based on requirements and scenario coverage in the current
> specification) whether the local area class can be extended to cover
> scenarios for the 1.28Mcps TDD Home Node B, or a new class needs to be
> defined
For RAN1:
● Physical Layer
> \- Investigation on if and which 1.28Mcps TDD physical layer specifications
> might be impacted
For RAN2 and RAN3:
● Architecture
> \- Investigation on which UTRAN interfaces might be impacted for 1.28Mcps
> TDD Home NodeB
>

> scalable manner
● Implications of deployment and/or operational scenario for 1.28Mcps TDD Home
NodeB
> \- Potential for very high density of 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeBs
>
> Note: for the investigation of this topic, it shall be taken into account
> that rigorous planning is not necessarily possible and/or desirable for
> consumer premise equipment
● Mobility and access control
Investigation on if and which 1.28Mcps TDD air interfaces might be impacted
# 5 RF Aspects (RAN WG4)
## 5.1 Requirements [5]
RF Requirements for 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeBs will base on the local area
1.28Mcps TDD NodeB, with additional requirements as described in the
following,
1) 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeBs should not degrade significantly the performance
of networks deployed in other channels. 5% performance degradation is
acceptable to Macro BS.
> Adjacent channel co-existence should be considered as the worst case.
>
> Performance is quantified in terms of UE throughput, coverage and spectral
> efficiency, taking into account cell edge, average UE and close to the Home
> NodeB.
2) 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB configurations intended for deployment in the same
carrier as an existing 1.28Mcps TDD network should ensure their combined
performance is not significantly worse than that of the original network.
> This requirement is only applicable if it is deemed feasible to deploy Home
> NodeBs in the same channel as an existing network.
>
> Combined performance is equal to the addition of macro network and the Home
> NodeB network taking into account the open/closed access configuration.
> Performance is quantified in terms of UE throughput, coverage and spectral
> efficiency, taking into account cell edge, average UE and close to the Home
> NodeB same as 1).
3) 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeBs should provide reasonable performance whether
deployed in isolation or whether multiple Home NodeBs are deployed in the same
area.
> Home NodeBs should provide a minimum level of performance, even when many
> are deployed near to each other, as would be the case in a housing estate.
> Furthermore, any interference mitigation techniques used to meet
> requirements 1 and 2 should do so without significantly compromising the
> performance of the Home NodeB. For example, a simple mechanism could switch
> off the Home NodeB when it causes interference. However, the Home NodeB
> itself would then be of no value.
>
> Performance is quantified in terms of UE throughput, coverage, and spectral
> efficiency, taking into account cell edge and average UE.
4) As 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeBs may be owned privately and portable, it shall
only radiate while it is confirmed that such an emission complies with
regulatory requirements in force where that Home NodeB is operating.
> Radiation in licensed spectrum requires authorization from the license
> holder (i.e. an operator), who in turn is responsible for ensuring that
> emissions comply with the associated regulatory requirements. One key issue
> here is how the operator will verify that the Home NodeB is in the
> geographical region specified in their license. Whilst it is clear that a
> procedure is needed to support this requirement, it is considered to be
> beyond the scope of RAN WG4 to define it. Currently RAN4 assumes that the
> following aspects would need to be taken into account:
>
> \- HNB location
>
> 1\. Home NodeB must be within operator' license Area when they are
> operating.
>
> 2\. A more precise location may be required for other reasons, such as
> emergency service.
>
> \- communication link between HNB and HNB operator
>
> 3\. There must be a communication link to receive authorization
>
> 4\. The link may need to achieve minimum performance requirements for
> offered services.
>
> \- HNB identity.
>
> 5\. The Home NodeB operator must be able to verify the Home NodeB indentity.
>
> \- other FFS
5) 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB must support UE speeds up to 30 km/h.
> Need to support UE speeds greater than 30 km/h is extremely unlikely.
> Further reductions in supported speed may be possible, but are not critical,
> since a limit of 30 km/h represents a significant and useful reduction from
> the current local area specification.
6) 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB must support existing 1.28Mcps TDD UEs.
> Home NodeB must be backwards compatible with 1.28Mcps TDD UEs already in the
> field.
## 5.2 Deployment Configurations [7]
The following aspects are considered for Home NodeB deployment configuration:
\- Open access or CSG (Closed Subscriber Group)
> \- Open access Home NodeB makes no difference from a generic NodeB and can
> serve any UE.
>
> \- CSG Home NodeBs only serve UEs belonging to a particular Closed
> Subscriber Group
\- Dedicated channels, co-channels, sharing channel
> \- Dedicated channels: Home NodeBs operate on their own separate channels
> which are not shared by macros cells.
>
> \- Co-channels: Home NodeBs and macro cells operate on the same existing
> channels.
>
> \- Full sharing channels: Home NodeB and macro cells share a set of
> channels. Home NodeBs can choose to operate on some channels from the set
> according to the channel interference measurement.
>
> \- Partial Sharing Channels: macro cells can reside on all the channels of a
> channel set, while Home NodeB can only share part of the set.
\- Fixed or adaptive (DL) maximum transmit power
> \- Fixed: Home NodeBs transmit power levels are confined to a set fixed
> maximum values.
>
> \- Adaptive: Home NodeB's sense interference to existing networks, and
> adjust maximum transmit power accordingly
Considering on the analysis of interference between the macro cells and Home
NodeBs, the following configurations are considered and described in more
detail in the following sections.
> A. CSG, Dedicated channels, Fixed Power
>
> B. CSG, Dedicated channels, Adaptive Power
>
> C. CSG, Full sharing channels, Adaptive Power
>
> D. CSG, Partial sharing channels, Adaptive Power
>
> E. CSG, Co-channels, Adaptive Power
>
> F. Open Access, dedicated or co-channel
### 5.2.1 Configuration A. CSG, Dedicated Channels, Fixed Power
Home NodeB is configured as a Closed Subscriber Group. Access to Home NodeB is
controlled through an agreement between the Home NodeB owner and the network
operator. Only the UEs allowed by the agreement are able to access the Home
NodeB, other UEs do not have access to the Home NodeB.
The Home NodeBs are allocated to operate on dedicated channels which are not
shared by the macro cells. The worst interference case is the adjacent channel
interference between the neighboring Home NodeBs and this interference is
especially severe when exactly the same channels are employed by the
neighboring Home NodeBs.
Compared to the case Home NodeB and macro cell share the same channel, the
dedicated channel configuration greatly reduces the interference between the
macro cell and Home NodeB. However, the co-channel interference scenarios
between Home NodeBs sharing the same channels still need analysis, especially,
in the region where dense populations of Home NodeBs operate. In this
configuration, the Home NodeB's maximum transmit power could potentially be
fixed by the operator according to the deployment environment and interference
level to/from adjacent Home NodeB or macro-cells. The fixed maximum transmit
level shall not be set to too low for guaranteeing Home NodeB serving size.
### 5.2.2 Configuration B. CSG, Dedicated Channels, Adaptive Power
Home NodeBs are configured as a Closed Subscriber Group and operate on
dedicated channels.
In this configuration, the maximum transmit power is adjustable for balancing
the interference to/from macro-cells and adjacent Home NodeBs. The maximum
transmit power may be set as high as the maximum capability of the Home NodeB.
However, this adjustable power shall be confined to a suitable level regarding
the interference to other Home NodeBs or Macro cells.
### 5.2.3 Configuration C. CSG, Full sharing channels, Adaptive Power
Home NodeBs are configured as a Closed Subscriber Group. Before a Home NodeB
resides on channel(s), it shall listen to a set of available channels shared
by Home NodeBs and macro cells and chooses the channels that have the least
interference. The interference levels can be decided by the Home NodeB
according to itself measurement or reports from the Home NodeB UE. The maximum
transmit power level are adaptively configured according to the interference
measurement. For lowering the interference to other Home NodeBs and macro
cells at a reasonable level, the maximum transmit power can be set as low as
possible, but shall guarantee provide the qualified service.
This configuration is a balance of the interference and the limited channels.
In this configuration, the Home NodeBs can operate on any channel assigned,
when they experience unacceptable interference on channels from adjacent home
NodeBs or from macro cells, they can shift to the other channels with lower
interference.
### 5.2.4 Configuration D. CSG, Partial sharing channels, Adaptive Power
Home NodeB is configured as a Closed Subscriber Group. Compared to the
configuration C, Home NodeB only shares part of the channel set, while macro
cells can reside on all the channels in the set as shown in Figure 1.
In this configuration, when macro cell UEs in the shared part experience
interference from Home NodeB, they can move to the clear part only available
to macro cells UE. Home NodeBs can also choose to work on some channels in the
share part based on the channel interference measurement. Further, Home NodeB
can decide on changing to another channel(s) in the shared part when they
experience unacceptable interference from Home NodeB or macro cells.
Figure 5.2.4.1-1: Partial channel sharing with Macro and Home NodeBs
### 5.2.5 Configuration E. CSG, Co-channel, Adaptive Power
Home NodeB is configured as a Closed Subscriber Group and shares the same
channels as the macro network. This configuration introduces the worst
interference case between the Home NodeB and macro cells. The transmit power
levels of both macro-cell and Home NodeB share be controlled in an appropriate
manner for balancing the interference between. This configuration envisages
the highest risk.
### 5.2.6 Configuration F: Open Access, dedicated or co-channel
Open access Home NodeBs serve all UEs in the same way as a generic NodeB does.
The Home NodeBs operate on dedicated channels or share the same channels with
macro cells.
In this configuration, Home NodeB can be considered as an enhancement for the
cell coverage and traffic load.
## 5.3 Interference Scenarios and Analysis
### 5.3.1 Interference Scenarios [8]
Considering interferences between Home NodeB and Macro BS and among Home
NodeBs, all interference scenarios are listed in Table 5.3.1.
Scenario 1, scenario 2, scenario 3 and scenario 4 are interference scenarios
considering Home NodeB and Macro Base station. To scenario 1 and 4, the worst
case is that Home NodeB is close to Macro BS, and UE attached Home NodeB
locates the cell border of Home NodeB. To scenario 2 and 3, the worst case is
that the Macro UE is close to Home NodeB and Macro UE located at the cell edge
of Macro BS.
There are 2 interference scenarios between a Home NodeB and the macro NodeB
for protecting Macro NodeB. One is Home NodeB Uplink interfere with Maro NodeB
Uplink i.e. Scenario 1, another is Home NodeB Downlink interfere with Macro
NodeB Downlink i.e. Scenario 2. There are two aspects to evaluate Macro BS'
performance, P-CCPCH receipt and Macro NodeB' HSDPA throughput.
Scenario 5 and Scenario 6 are interference between Home NodeB 1 and Home NodeB
2. In these two scenarios, any close distance between Home NodeB and UE
attached to other Home NodeB can be cause to produce interference.

It is suggested that Monte Carlo method from TR 25.942 and determinative
methods are applied on interference simulation of Home NodeBs and Macro BS.

Each building consists of 6 floors, and each floor has 25 apartments (5x5).
Each apartment is of size 10x10 m (100 m2). In addition to indoor areas, the
model contains also an outdoor area surrounding the building, shown in Figure
5.3.2.1.1-2.
The HNBs are placed in the middle of the rooms. The active HNB number in each
building is 5, 10, 20 and 30; hence the total numbers of HNBs distributed in
the victim sector are equal to 50, 100, 200, and 300.
For Uplink: Two PC control method are simulated in Scenario 1, 3, and 5:
1\. ISCP control+ CLPC (Closed Loop PC): UE measure the SNPL of neighbor HNB,
and report SNPL to the Control HNB. HNB control the Home UE's interference to
other HNBs under the target of -102dBm.
2\. CLPC: Closed Loop PC; UE does not report SNPL to the Control HNB. Only
closed Loop PC is controlled by Control HNB.
In order to investigate the dependency on the strength of the macro cell, Home
NodeBs located in different locations are also simulated in Scenario 1, 2, 3,
and 4. In this case, one special building is constrained to be located in one
of the following Location, and the Macro UE is located in the investigated
building.
\- Location A ("close to macro site, Distance between Macro BS and block is
0.2r").
\- Location B ("middle of macro cell, Distance between Macro BS and block is
0.6r").
\- Location C ("close to macro cell border, Distance between Macro BS and
block is r").
Where: r is cell radium.

This simulation is run at 5X5 apartment. Home NodeB randomly distributed in
one Macro cell: 10 building are uniformly distributed in Sector 1. The Macro
UE is uniformly distributed in one sector of the central macro cell. Closed
loop power control (CLPC) with or without ISCP control is used for Home Node B
UL while CLPC with ISCP control is used for Macro Node B UL. The UL throughput
of Macro Node B is given in Figure 5.3.2.2.1-1, and the ISCP is given in
Figure 5.3.2.2.1-2. The throughput loss of CLPC+ ISCP is lower than CLPC.

This simulation is run at 5X5 apartment. Home NodeB randomly distributed in
one Macro cell: 10 building are uniformly distributed in Sector 1. The Macro
UE is uniformly distributed in one sector of the central macro cell.
The Throughput degenerations of Macro UE are presented in Table 5.3.2.2.2.1-1.
With the increase of the active HNB in each building, the throughput of Macro
UE increase accordingly. Generally speaking, the overall throughput
degeneration caused by adjacent channel HNB interference is slight.

shown in Figure 5.3.2.2.2.2.2-1. As a result, the MUE downlink interference
increases obviously with the increase of HNB output power and HNB penetration
rate. The P-CCPCH outage probability is nearly 5%\~9.5 % with 0dBm HNB
transmit power.

##### 5.3.2.2.2.2.4 Conclusion {#conclusion .H6}
Downlink co-existence between Home NodeBs (aggressor) and Macro UEs (victim)
is analyzed. Both the impact of the HNB density as well as the maximum HNB
output power has been considered. Furthermore, the study has been performed
for both co-channel and adjacent channel deployment scenarios.
The results for the co-channel deployment indicate considerable interference
problems at locations where the macro P-CCPCH and HSDPA are fairly weak, which
results in high outage probability and throughput loss around the HNBs. The
interference can be reduced for example by lowering the HNB maximum output
power. According to the simulation results, there is a need to set the maximum
HNB output power to lower than 0dBm, or in some cases even below that, in
order to obtain an acceptable "coverage vs. interference" trade-off.
The adjacent channel deployment is found to work much better. The HNB maximum
output power could be much higher than the co-channel deployment scenario.
However, assuming some form of downlink interference control also for the
adjacent channel scenario could further improve the HNB performance.
##### 5.3.2.2.3 Scenario 3: UE attached to Macro Node B（Uplink）  Home Node B
Uplink
This simulation is run at 5X5 apartment. Home NodeB randomly distributed in
one Macro cell: 10 building are uniformly distributed in Sector 1. The Macro
UE is uniformly distributed in one sector of the central macro cell.
The throughput when using CLPC with ISCP control is a little higher than
without ISCP control, this could be seen from Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1. Compared
with the throughput of same active HNB number in Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1 and Figure
5.3.2.2.5-2, we can see that Macro NB has little influence to the uplink
throughput of HNB UE.

In Figure 5.3.2.2.3-2, we could see that when using ISCP control, the HNB ISCP
can be maintained in a lower level compare with no ISCP control.

##### 5.3.2.2.4 Scenario 4: Macro Node B（Downlink）  Home Node B Downlink
This simulation is run at 5X5 apartment. Home NodeB randomly distributed in
one Macro cell: 10 building are uniformly distributed in Sector 1. The Macro
UE is uniformly distributed in one sector of the central macro cell.
The HNB throughput could be seen from Figure 5.3.2.2.4-1. It could be seen
that the HNB output power has almost no influence to the downlink throughput
in this case. Compared with the throughput of the blue line in Figure
5.3.2.2.4-1 and the dashed red line in Figure 5.3.2.2.6-1, it is shown that
Macro NB has little influence to the uplink throughput of HNB UE.

Simulations are also conducted in a semi-detached house environment as
depicted in Figure 5.3.2.1.1-3. It is assumed that the HUE can roam
arbitrarily in the house. Four macro-HNB distances are studied in this
section: 30m, 60m, 120m and 200m.
The macro interference to HUE is discussed for 4 cases:
\- Case 1: HUE in the 1^st^ floor and macro NB to the south
\- Case 2: HUE in the 1^st^ floor and macro NB to the northwest.
\- Case 3: HUE in the 2^nd^ floor and macro NB to the south
\- Case 4: HUE in the 2^nd^ floor and macro NB to the northwest.
For co-channel deployment, the HNB DL deadzone statistics are given in Figure

The 95-percentile of the dead zone ratios, i.e., Pr(dead zone ratio\<y%) =

It can be seen that in certain co-channel deployment scenarios a nearby macro
NB can impose a high level of interference, resulting in DL deadzone areas for
the HUE.

Based on the above study, the adjacent-channel downlink interference from the
macro layer in this particular deployment (semi-detached house) has been found
to be very insignificant.
These findings highlight the ability of a Network Monitor Mode, or "sniffer",
in the HNB to help provide improved coverage --scanning the RF environment
will allow for the HNB to self-configure to the best available channel.
##### 5.3.2.2.5 Scenario 5: UE attached to Home Node B（Uplink）  Home Node B
Uplink（Home NodeB）
This simulation is run at 5X5 apartment. Home NodeB randomly distributed in
one Macro cell: 10 building are uniformly distributed in Sector 1. Only intra
HNB interference is simulated.
HNB UL throughput of ISCP control+ Closed Loop PC and Closed Loop PC are given
in this section. When the active HNB number in each building is 5, 10, 20, and
30, the throughput of ISCP control+ Closed Loop PC and Closed Loop PC are
almost the same. Frequency reuse 3 can increase the HNB UL throughput.
The ISCP can be controlled in ISCP control + Closed Loop PC case, while the
ISCP in Closed Loop Power control case is not under control. For the
simulation case of frequency reuse number is 1, when the active HNB number in
each building is 5, 10, 20 and 30, the ISCP of ISCP control + Closed Loop PC
are -102.8dBm, -100.0 dBm, -98.1 dBm, and -97.3 dBm, respectively. The ISCP of
Closed Loop Power control is not under control, the ISCP are -58.6dBm, -52.9
dBm,-47.7 dBm, -45.2 dBm, respectively.

Figure 5.3.2.2.5-2: Home NodeB UL Throughput with Frequency reuse 3
It is shown that frequency reuse 3 can increase the UL throughput of Home
NodeB. In order to enhance the throughput of HNB, more frequency band should
be reserved for HNB.
If SNPL is not reported by Home UE, the ISCP of HNB can not be controlled.
Some ISCP control method should be introduced in Home NodeB environment. E.g.
the same ISCP control method as Macro NodeB or the maximum UL output power of
Home UE should be limited by the self optimization process of Control HNB
according to the neighbor Home Node B number and distance.
Simulations are also conducted in the modern apartment building depicted in
Figure 5.3.2.1.1-4. The victim HNB is located at the door way of the western
apartment. The UL HNB-HNB interference is studied in 5 cases:
\- Aggressor HNB in East, 2 floor separation
\- Aggressor HNB in East, 1 floor separation
\- Aggressor HNB in West, 1 floor separation
\- Aggressor HNB in North, living room, same floor
\- Aggressor HNB in North, same floor
The complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs) of the noise rise
from different ABS is given in Figure 5.3.2.2.5-3.

Figure 5.3.2.2.5-3: CCDFs of noise rise at VBS. (a) full plot (b) zoomed plot
It can be seen co-channel HNB-HNB UL interference is only significant when the
aggressor HNB is far away from the victim apartment, and the victim HNB is
close to the aggressor apartment.
Adaptive noise figure (NF) is an effective mean to mitigate UL interference
for such cases. When VBS experiences an noise rise that is large enough to
block the uplink connection, it can adjust its NF so that the associated HUE
can power up to maintain the connection.
Monte-Carlo runs are also conducted to obtain the CCDF of noise rise at ABS,
assuming 12 dB extra NF at VBS. The result is given in Figure 5.3.2.2.5-4.
{width="5.346527777777778in" height="3.99375in"}
Figure 5.3.2.2.5-4: Noise rise statistics at ABS with VBS NF+12 dB
Based on the above simulation results we can have the following findings:
\- The co-channel HNB-HNB UL interference is insignificant in most cases.
\- The co-channel HNB-HNB UL interference can be significant if VBS is close
to the aggressor apartment and ABS is far away from the victim apartment
(e.g., VBS in West, door way and ABS in North, living room, same floor).
\- Adaptive NF technique is an effective method to tackle HNB-HNB UL
interference.
##### 5.3.2.2.6 Scenario 6: Home Node B (Downlink)  Other Home Node B
Downlink (UE)
This simulation is run at 5X5 apartment. Home NodeB randomly distributed in
one Macro cell: 10 building are uniformly distributed in Sector 1. Only intra
HNB interference is simulated.
DL interferes among HNB with Frequency reuse number 1 and 3 are given in this
section. When the active HNB number in each building is 5, 10, 20, and 30, the
throughput gains of frequency reuse number 3 are 186kbps, 281kbps, 360kbps,
and 402kbps, respectively.
{width="6.247916666666667in" height="4.685416666666667in"}
Figure 5.3.2.2.6-1: Home NodeB DL Throughput with output power 0dBm
It is shown that frequency reuse 3 can increase the throughput of Home NodeB.
In order to enhance the throughput of HNB, more frequency band should be
reserved for HNB.
The HNB to HNB DL interference simulations are also conducted in the modern
apartment building as depicted in Figure 5.3.2.1.1-4. Both single carrier
frequency and multiple carrier frequencies are used for this study.
For single carrier frequency, we assume the aggressor HNB located at the
western apartment doorway, and the following 4 victim HNB positions are
considered:
\- Victim (serving) HNB in East, same floor
\- Victim (serving) HNB in North, same floor
\- Victim (serving) HNB in West, 1 floor separation
\- Victim (serving) HNB in North living room, same floor
In Figure 5.3.2.2.6-2 we give the HNB DL deadzone statistics. It can be seen:
\- If the ABS-VBS deployment is non-adjacent on the same floor or has floor
separation the resulting DL deadzone is insignificant.
\- HNB DL interference and the resulting deadzone can be significant for
adjacent apartments in the same floor.
\- The case of north apartment with HNB in the living room suffers most due to
the near-far effect between ABS and VBS.

Figure 5.3.2.2.6-2: CCDF of deadzone coverage area (ABS in West)
Increasing the number of carrier frequencies of HNBs can be an effective
method to mitigate DL interference. Using the worst case above (ABS in West,
VBS in North, living room, same floor), we assign 1, 3 and 6 carrier
frequencies respectively and study the DL deadzone statistics. The HNBs are
assumed to randomly choose one from the multiple carrier frequencies. The
deadzone statistics is given in Figure 5.3.2.2.6-3.
{width="4.879166666666666in" height="3.64375in"}
Figure 5.3.2.2.6-3: CCDF of deadzone with ABS in West, VBS in North living
room, same floor.
From Figure 5.3.2.2.6-3 it can be seen that even with random carrier
configuration (the simplest and dumbest approach), increasing frequency reuse
number can effectively mitigate HNB-HNB DL interference.
A natural question that can be raised is: how many carrier frequencies are
necessary to mitigate HNB-HNB DL interference? In the analysis below we aim to
determine the number of carrier frequencies needed for HNB DL interference
mitigation. To make the study in a more realistic framework, we use RSSI based
carrier configuration scheme as follows:
1\. There are a total of _K_ carrier frequencies available for HNBs: fc,
fc+fs, ... fc+(K-1)fs.
2\. Once power on, an HNB scans the K frequencies and picks the one that has
least interference.
3\. If multiple carrier frequencies are legitimate candidates, an HNB selects
the one with lowest index.
To analyze the HNB-HNB DL interference, we consider an extreme deployment
case: Every apartment in the building has an HNB activated, i.e., 100% HNB
density. Since interference from aggressors with ≥2 floor separation is
negligible, we only have to study 3 floors of the apartment building. As
depicted in Figure5.3.2.2.6-4, we assume the serving HNB is in the south
apartment and there is an aggressor HNB in each of the apartments on the same
floor, upper floor and lower floor.
{width="6.317361111111111in" height="5.438194444444444in"}
Figure 5.3.2.2.6-4: Modern apartment building with 100% HNB loading
We allocate 4 carrier frequencies to HNB and follow the self-configuration
scheme described above. The deadzone statistics hence obtained are given in
Figure 5.3.2.2.6-5.
{width="4.627777777777778in" height="3.45625in"}
Figure 5.3.2.2.6-5: HNB DL deadzone statistics with VBS in South, 4 fc's, 100%
HNB density
It can be seen with 95% probability the DL deadzone area is ≤2.7% of the
southern apartment area, which is negligible. Therefore in this model 4
carrier frequencies are enough to mitigate HNB DL interference, even with 100%
deployment density.
Since 4 carrier frequencies can be an overkill if the HNB density is
relatively low, it would also be of interest to know the deployment density
that is suitable for 3 carrier frequencies without causing significant DL
interference.
Based on the findings above we can estimate (conservatively) the percentage of
the "significantly interfered" HNBs as below:
Pr(HNBs with significant DL interference)= $\frac{L \ast p^{4} \ast 2}{4 \ast
L \ast p} = 0\text{.}5p^{3}$
Based on the above equation we plot the curve of Pr(HNBs with significant DL
interference) vs. the HNB density in Figure 5.3.2.2.6-6. It can be seen the
5-percentile HNB density is \~0.47.
{width="5.002083333333333in" height="3.7402777777777776in"}
Figure 5.3.2.2.6-6: HNB-HNB DL interference vs. deployment density, 3 carrier
frequencies
Based on the above study conducted in a modern apartment building, we can draw
the following conclusions:
\- Co-channel HNB DL interference and the resulting deadzone can be
significant in certain cases.
\- Increasing the frequency reuse number for HNBs can effectively mitigate DL
interference.
\- 4 carrier frequencies can provide sufficient DL interference mitigation,
even with 100% HNB density.
With 3 carrier frequencies the HNB density should be ≤0.47 without causing
significant DL interference.
#### 5.3.2.3 Conclusion
With the increase of active HNB number, the throughput loss of Closed Loop
Power control without ISCP control become higher. When HNB is deployed in a
place near Macro NB, without the ISCP control, the throughput of Macro UE has
been significant impacted. Also, without ISCP control, the ISCP value of HNB
is unacceptable. So, HNB should deploy some mechanism to limit the UE power.
When the Macro UE is uniform distributed, the downlink throughput degeneration
is slight. But under some special scenario (Macro UE located in cell edge),
the downlink throughput degeneration of Macro UE is significant when HNB power
is 13dBm. So, interference mitigation technique is necessary, e.g. adjust the
output power adaptively according to the distance between HNB and Macro NB.
Macro UE has little influence to the DL/UL throughput of HNB UE, the DL/UL
throughput of HNB UE mainly restricted by the intra-interference.
Frequency reuse can increase the DL and UL throughput of HNB. In order to
enhance the throughput of HNB, more frequency band is suggested to be reserved
for HNB.

#### 5.4.3.3 Frequency Accuracy [6]
This section includes the investigation of frequency accuracy requirements in
the home environment.
The modulated carrier accuracy for local area NodeB is required to be equal to
0.1ppm as in [3] with consideration on the high speed mobility of UE, but the
same frequency accuracy requirement is not necessary for Home NodeB in terms
of deployment scenarios considering Home NodeBs are usually deployed at home
and office, it is most likely that the serving UEs are in slow mobility
profile and 30Km/h speed should be the reasonable assumption for defining
minimum performances for Home NodeB frequency. Taking the conformance of
frequency accuracy in the radio interface with the maximum mobility into
account, the Home NodeB modulated carrier frequency can be relaxed to 0.25 PPM
in [2]. Furthermore, as Home NodeB is a cost-sensitive home device and the low
accurate crystal is much more expensive than the high accurate crystal, the
0.25ppm crystal can reduce the cost of the Home NodeB compared to the 0.1ppm
crystal.
Two issues have been taken into concern in [2] regarding the 0.25ppm
relaxation, one is timing synchronization and the other is the impact of the
inaccuracy on the HomeNodeB performance.
Two alternative approaches are analyzed in [2][4]regarding timing
synchronization: one is to provide timing and synchronization via GPS and the
other is through Precision Timing Protocol (PTP, IEEE 1588). According the
analysis in [2], the GPS-based solution envisages a great risk as Home Node B
is usually installed indoors, the signals are greatly degraded by roofs and
walls and this makes the synchronization quite unstable, furthermore, the GPS
device and maintaining the GPS antennas may be beyond some customers'
affordability. The second approach IEEE 1588 is prospective since it needs no
device maintenance and the embedded software implementation of 1588 protocol
can meet the Home NodeB timing synchronization requirement.
For assessing the impact of the 0.25ppm frequency offset on the system
performance, some link level simulations were conducted in [2]. The simulation
demonstrates that when the frequency offset correction (FOC) is employed at
UE, compared with the 0.1ppm frequency offset without any frequency offset
correction, 0.25ppm only suffers about 0.85dB performance loss at BLER 10^−1^.
Consider the walls indoors usually can cause about 10dB loss, the loss from
0.25ppm frequency accuracy is acceptable and this loss can be balanced by
downlink power control.
The assumptions for the simulation are listed in the Table 5.4.3.3-1 and
simulation results are shown in and Table 5.4.3.3-2 respectively.

##### 5.4.5.1.1 The Theoretical Analysis the Noise Rise in Home NodeB
The sensitivity level for FDD local area BS was derived by analysing the noise
rise for UL in Picocell, which is interfered by a micro cell operating in
adjacent frequency channel. The same analytical methods used in sub-clause
A2.2 of 25.951 can be employed for 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB receiver
sensitivity level derivation as well. In 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB deployment,
the macro NodeB is usually employed for local area coverage instead of a micro
NodeB, therefore modelling the Macro UE as interference source to the 1.28Mcps
TDD Home NodeB is reasonable. Figure 5.4.5.1.1-1 depicts the scenario model
used.
Figure 5.4.5.1.1-1: Local BS or Home NodeB operating at Macro-cell adjacent
frequency channel.
Denote the **_I_** as the interference level in the Home NodeB with an
interfering Macro UE located in the same room as 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB, use
the method in sub-clause A2.2 of 25.951, the interference **_I_** can be
obtained as
Where **_R~ref~_** is the reference channel data rate, **_P~h~_** is the Home
NodeB or Micro cell transmit power, $\rho$ and $\rho$ are the _E~b~/N~0\ ~_
requirements for reference channel and uplink dedicated channel respectively.
$I_{\text{UL}}$is macro cell uplink interference level, _ACIR_DL_ and
_ACIR_UL_ are the adjacent channel interference ratio in downlink and uplink
respectively. $R_{\text{UL}}$is the dedicated channel uplink data rate. χ is
the power adjustment parameter; when χ=1 (0 dB), if the reference service is
given the same power as for the P-CCPCH, and χ=2 (3 dB) indicates the
reference service is given 3 dB less power than for the P-CCPCH. Notice that
the interference in UL in Home NodeB is independent on the pathloss between
macro and Home NodeB.
For 1.28Mcps TDD, the parameters used for obtaining **_I_** is listed in Table
5.4.5.1.1-1.

From the analytical study and numerical computation above shows that compared
to a macro cell, noise rise in 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB due to the interfering
macro cell is about 7.2dB with 64kbps bit rate for the worst case.
##### 5.4.5.1.2 Simulation for Evaluating the Noise Rise in Home NodeB
The reference sensitivity power level is the minimum mean power received at
the antenna connector at which a throughput requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel. It is seen as a measure of the RF
receiver's noise figure and base band demodulation capability. Since the
difference in reference sensitivity between MNB and HNB is only depending on
the noise figure. The Home Node B reference sensitivity level can be
determined by desensitization based on the MNB, for which the tolerable noise
figure should be determined based on simulation.
In Evaluating the Noise Rise in Home NodeB，Some simulations are conducted to
study the impact of the noise rise in 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB when it coexists
with Macro cell scenario and two different simulation methods are applied. And
the two simulations derived the similar results on the noise rise level in
Home NodeB. Clause 5.4.5.1.2.1 and 5.4.5.1.2.2 outline these two different
simulation methods and results on the sensitivity level in Home NodeB.
##### 5.4.5.1.2.1 Simulation method 1 {#simulation-method-1 .H6}
In simulation method 1, the most important and typical scenario captured for
evaluating the adjacent channel interference is by setting a macro UE at the
edge of a macro-cell transmitting high power in UL close to a Home NodeB. In
this scenario, the Macro UE receives not only the data from the anchored
macro-cell but also the interference from the Home NodeB. The used simulation
parameters can be found in Table 5.4.5.1.2-1 and modulation and code rate
choice is in Table 5.4.5.1.2-2.

Simulation results show when the macro-cell users are located inside the rooms
with Home NodeB, UL noise rise in HomeNodeB is growing by 6.6 -7.1dB according
to different number of users activated as listed in Table 5.4.5.1.2-3. With
all the Home NodeBs, only the 5 worst Home NodeBs noise rise were picked out
for averaging. Table 5.4.5.1.2-3 and Figure 5.4.5.1.2-1 indicate when the
macro-cell users are located indoors as interfering source for Home NodeB, the
UL noise rise in 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB is around 7dB and does not increase
or decrease monotonously as the number of active Home NodeB does.

The simulations show the worst case noise rise in Home NodeBs is about 7 dB,
which matches the analytical studies in section 5.4.5.1.2. If the
implementation margin is considered to be 1.5dB, about 9dB sensitivity
degradation is proposed for Home NodeB or Local area BS class, which means
-110dBm+9dB = -101dBm sensitivity level for 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB.

In the case of "the impact of Home Node B noise rise on MNB capacity loss", we
consider the worst situation, Home Node B located in special Location: Ten

The other nine building is uniformly distributed in one sector.
Note: Location A ("close to macro site, Distance between Macro BS and block is

Where: r is cell radium.
In the other hand, the case of "the impact of MUE interference on HNB noise
rise", we consider two deployment scenario. Scenario 1 is MUE located in cell
edge at a distance D=R, which is the worst case. Scenario 2 is MUE located in
R/2 of the radius of Macro cell.
##### 5.4.5.1.2.2.2 Simulation Result {#simulation-result .H6}
The noise rise of HNB will cause the increase of UE output power to maintain
communication quality. Then the increased UE transmission power will cause
interference to a nearby MNB, thus degrading the performance of the MNB in
terms of throughput loss or coverage decrease. Figure 5.4.5.1.2.2.2-1 gives
the simulation results on the impact of HNB noise rise on MNB capacity loss.

Figure 5.4.5.1.2.2.2-1: MNB uplink throughput loss VS HNB noise rise
The simulation results are summarized in table5.4.5.1.2.2.2-1. The maximum
tolerable noise rise depends on the criterion of MNB throughput loss.

Receiver dynamic range is the receiver ability to handle a rise of
interference in the reception frequency channel. The receiver shall fulfil a
specified BER requirement for a specified sensitivity degradation of the
wanted signal in the presence of an interfering AWGN signal in the same
reception frequency channel.
Considering impact of co-channel uplink interference on the Home NodeB, it is
possible that Home NodeB receiver will be exposed to strong interference
signals from un-coordinated UEs. It was shown that the Home NodeB dynamic
range requirement needs to be extended by 20dB to protect the HNB from the
strong interference signal of an un-coordinated UE. This conclusion can be
reused in 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB.
The BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in Table

#### 5.4.5.5 Intermodulation characteristics [16]
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an

response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receiver
a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two or
more interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the
wanted signal.
The static reference performance as specified in sensitivity performance
should be met when the following signals are coupled to BS antenna input.
\- A wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency, with mean power 6 dB
above the static reference level.
\- Two interfering signals with the following parameters.
Using the reference measurement channel specified in Annex A of 3GPP TS
25.105, the reference sensitivity level and performance of the Home NodeB
shall be as specified in table 5.4.5.5-1.

### 5.4.6 Performance requirement [11]
To Multi-path Fading environment shown in Table B.2 of 25.105, case 1 and case
2 are considered for 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB performance requirements. However
to case 2, considering 16chips（12.5ms）detection window, 12ms delay seems too
much. So, just case 1 is recommended for 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB demodulation.
To Propagation Conditions for Multipath Fading Environments for E-DCH
Performance Requirements for 1,28 Mcps TDD shown in Table B.2A of 25.105 , ITU
Pedestrian A speed 3km/h (PA3)，ITU Pedestrian B speed 3km/h (PB3) and ITU
vehicular A speed 30km/h (VA30) are suitable to 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeB.
To Parameters in static propagation conditions and multipath Case 1 channel,
Ioc will be changed according to sensitivity changes of local area Base
station and Home NodeB.

be extended to cover scenarios for the 1.28Mcps TDD Home Node B, or a if new
class needs to be defined.

# 8 UTRAN Architecture and Application Protocol (RAN WG3)
This section includes the investigation of whether any UTRAN interfaces might
be impacted and investigation of whether 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeBs need to be
synchronized among each other or with the macro network and how
synchronization can be achieved in a scalable manner.
## 8.1 Synchronization [14]
### 8.1.1 V1588 synchronization scheme
IEEE PTP 1588V2 is an improved and optimized version with shortened form
relative to 1588, a precise time synchronization protocol.
IEEE 1588V2 calculates time shift and resident time introduced by intermediate
network equipment through information transmitted between principal and
subordinate equipments. It may decrease the effect of timing packet suffering
by saving and transmitting, thereby can realize precise synchronization
between principal and subordinate equipments.
Figure 8.1.1-1 describes the procedure calculating path delay and time shift
of principal and subordinate equipments.
{width="4.628472222222222in" height="3.4555555555555557in"}
**Figure 8.1.1-1: The procedure calculating path delay and time shift of
principal and subordinate equipments**
Subordinate equipment obtains $t_{1},t_{2},t_{3}$and$t_{4}$according to the
procedure above and calculates path delay between principal and subordinate
equipments using $t_{1},t_{2},t_{3}$and$t_{4}$, and further comes out time
shift. It will correct local time by this time shift.
**a) Path delay:**
**Then**
**b) Time shift：**
Subordinate equipment calculates time shift and corrects local time, and
synchronizes to principal equipment.
Figure 8.1.1-2 Principle of time correct
In real network, timing information between principal and subordinate
equipments involves several nodes. So each node in network is required to
maintain and correct path delay. Based on 1588V2 protocol, timing precision
can be in ns, some synchronization network may realize phase difference within
+/-1uS relative to datum reference source, which may make terrestrial
synchronization network meet or exceed the synchronization requirement of TDD
Home Node B network.
### 8.1.2 GPS synchronization scheme
GPS is an alternative Home Node B synchronisation scheme for it has already
been endorsed as an important local clock signal source for TD-SCDMA base
stations. GPS receives signal from more than one satellite and deciphers an
UTC time info.
Actually, the accuracy tightly depends on the propagation quality between GPS
receiver device and source satellites. The quality may be deteriorated when
GPS receiver is located in a closed building or with a long cable between GPS
antenna and receiver. Thereby on top of additional cost for GPS receiver, the
timing accuracy may not be adequate for a Home Node B synchronisation for
indoor coverage is a large percentage of its usage.
### 8.1.3 Air interface synchronization scheme
The concentration of TDD Home Node B air interface synchronization is how to
select the timing benchmark. Once the timing benchmark is selected, all Home
Node Bs in one location should automatically adjust their timing to this
benchmark.
The handover between Home Node B and Macro Node B must be supported, such that
Home Node B synchronizing with Marco Node B is a straight method without
additional complexity.
TDD Home Node B detects Macro Node B's DwPCH, and defines its timing benchmark
according to Macro Node B's DwPCH.
Considering the complex deployment scenario of TDD Home Node B network and
least impact on macro cellular deployment, Macro Node Bs and TDD Home Node Bs
are preferably deployed on different frequency. Home Node B should select the
best suitable macro cell from all candidates Macro Node Bs if it can detect
signal of multiple Macro Node Bs. The timing could be set using one reference
in figure 8.1.3-1.
**Figure 8.1.3-1:** TDD Home Node B Timing according to Macro Node B's DwPCH
Figure 8.1.3-1 gives three candidate TDD Home Node B air interface timing
adjust methods:
\- Reference 1: The frame boundary of Home Node B precedes anchored macro one
with one _τ_ ~adv~, which is given by macro Node B via a uplink
synchronisation procedure;
\- Reference 2: The frame boundary of Home Node B is exactly aligned with
anchored macro one via uplink synchronisation procedure;
\- Reference 3: Home Node B sets its frame boundary at the time point when it
detects a downlink synchronisation peak, which in principle lag _τ_ ~adv~
behind anchored macro one.
If reference 1 or 2 is selected, Home Node B shall behave as a regular TD-
SCDMA UE and perform a 'fake' random access in its synchronisation.
If Home Node B can not detect Macro Node Bs' DwPCH, according to its SON
characters, Home Node B may apply the following schemes but not necessarily be
restricted to the followings, to select its working frequency and timing.
\- When Home Node B is power on, it searches the best suitable Home Node B
from Home Node B available frequency list, and gets its timing advance.
\- Apply any type of Home Node B timing **reference** as shown in figure
8.1.3-1
If Home Node B can neither detect signal from Macro Node B nor from other Home
Node B, the timing rule is not needed to specify.
Due to cost concern, oscillators with loose timing accuracy and stability
requirement are preferred for Home Node B device. Therefore Home Node B needs
to periodically perform a synchronisation corroboration to amend impact
incurred by low stability and enable working frequency and timing accuracy in
an interference mitigated purpose.
The above synchronisation principle could be also used for multi-frequency TD-
SCDMA Home Node B because the timing reference signal, i.e. DwPTS, is only
located on primary frequency and one multiple-frequency Home Node B only
adopts one unique timing.
# 9 Conclusions
## 9.1 RAN4 Conclusions
\- 1.28Mcps TDD Home NodeBs should not degrade significantly the performance
of networks deployed in other channels.
