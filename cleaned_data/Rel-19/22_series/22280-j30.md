# 1 Scope
The present document provides the service requirements that are common across
two or more mission critical services, that is MCPTT, MCData and MCVideo. The
mission critical services make use of capabilities included in Group
Communications System Enablers and Proximity Services, with additional
requirements specific to the MCPTT Service as specified in 3GPP TS 22.179 [1],
MCVideo Service as specified in 3GPP TS 22.281 [2], and MCData Service as
specified in 3GPP TS 22.282 [3]. The mission critical services can be used for
public safety applications and maritime safety applications and also for
general commercial applications (e.g., utility companies, railways and
maritime usage). The requirements in this specification do not apply to GSM or
UMTS.

MCPTT Mission Critical Push To Talk
MCVideo Mission Critical Video
MCX Mission Critical X, with X = PTT or X= Video or X= Data
MCX Service Mission Critical Service
# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Rationale for MCCoRe
Further development of mission critical services beyond Mission Critical Push
To Talk (MCPTT), such as Mission Critical Video (MCVideo) and Mission Critical
Data (MCData), created an opportunity to re-use base functionality documented
in the Stage 1 requirements for MCPTT. For example, the ability to communicate
mission critical information to groups of users is a common need regardless of
service type. Wherever originating MCPTT requirements were found to be in
common with other mission critical services, those requirements were moved to
this Technical Specification (3GPP TS 22.280). Each requirement that was moved
has been voided in 3GPP TS 22.179, and an informative annex has been created
at the end of that specification documenting the location of the originating
3GPP TS 22.179 requirement in the present document.
## 4.2 MCCoRe creation process
The creation of 3GPP TS 22.280 followed a thorough analysis by mission
critical application stakeholders of all the requirements in 3GPP TS 22.179,
TR 22.879, and TR 22.880. Each set of requirements was evaluated, requirement-
by-requirement, to determine if any one requirement was applicable to another
service (MCPTT, MCVideo, or MCData). If anyone requirement was shared between
two or more services, it was designated as a Mission Critical Services Common
Requirements (MCCoRe) requirement and placed into this technical
specification. At the end of this specification, there are sets of normative
annexes that enumerate each requirement in the present document that is
applicable to the given scope for the annex. For instance, one annex covers
MCPTT, and there is a comprehensive table that lists every requirement that
follows in clauses 5-9 that are applicable to MCPTT.
In the present document the term, MCX Service, is used to mean any mission
critical service and when applied in requirements it means any mission
critical service that is identified in the normative annexes as applying to
the requirement in question. When the term, MCX Service, is used multiple
times in a single requirement it means the same MCX Service except in the case
of the inter service interworking in clause 8. Therefore, other than
requirements in the inter services interworking clause, all requirements in
the present document are single service requirements.
In principle, a mission critical group could use multiple services. At any
time during a mission critical group communication, a group of mission
critical users can, subject to permissions and availability of services and
capable UEs, start or stop using any one or more instantiation(s) of any of
the MCX services. In the text of the specification for each individual
service, the group is considered to use the services of that individual type,
and consequently is called MCPTT Group, MCVideo Group, MCData Group, or
generically, MCX Service Group. Referring to a group as an individual service
group is for writing simple requirements purposes, and does not mean that the
group cannot actively use other services. See sub-clause 8.4 for more
information.
The grouping and consolidation of common requirements shared by multiple
mission critical applications is not to be construed as a statement or
requirement of architectural design, impacting entities and interfaces. It is
for downstream working groups to determine whether they can:
a) create generic MCX Service functionality that can be re-used by all Mission
Critical Applications virtually unmodified;
b) extend and/or customize common MCX Services, if they determine that a
Mission Critical Application has special needs, or
c) define separate support for Mission Critical Applications if they determine
that they are so specialized that they cannot take advantage of a common MCX
Service.

communication, all participants may be notified about the late entry member
joining the Group communication.
## 5.4 Receiving from multiple MCX Service communications
### 5.4.1 Overview
MCX Users receive communications traffic of their affiliated MCX Service
Groups. This multiple receiving, called monitoring by some organizations,
provides MCX Users current information about police, fire or critical medical
events that are occurring within their jurisdictions. This is useful for
dispatchers or those that might not be the primary support for that event at
that moment. The information gained by monitoring might be useful for the
dispatcher to determine any actions to take or be useful later if the MCX User
is deployed to provide additional support for that event. The MCX User might
be assigned to support the activities of more than one MCX Service Group on
the same shift. This means that the MCX User receives multiple MCX Service
Groups.
An MCX User with limited resources (e.g., a handheld UE) might find that using
concurrent received MCX Service communications from multiple active MCX
Service Groups becomes confusing. During periods of time when the MCX User is
receiving communications from multiple MCX Service Groups, which MCX Service
Group\'s communication is presented to the MCX User is determined by the MCX
User\'s choice, the priority associated with the sender of the Selected MCX
Service Group, other considerations or combinations of these. The MCX UE is
aware of all the active groups to which the MCX User has affiliated and which
is the selected group (if any). The identities of the other active receiving
groups can be made available for display on the MCX UE. When the receive
activity from the Selected MCX Service Group stops, the MCX UE might present
the communications from another group per the MCX User\'s choice or by other
means.
If none of the multiple groups to which the MCX User has affiliated or
selected is active, the MCX UE would continue to monitor for activity by any
of the multiple affiliated or Selected MCX Service Groups. Monitoring for
activity of multiple MCX Service Groups is also known as scanning and the list
of the multiple groups is also known as a scan list.
### 5.4.2 Requirements

[R-5.4.2-005] The MCX Service shall provide multiple MCX Service User IDs to
an MCX UE when multiple MCX Service Groups that have a sender are received by
the MCX UE.
[R-5.4.2-006] The MCX Service shall allow an authorized MCX UE to receive on-
network MCX Service Group and off-network MCX Service Group Communications
simultaneously.
[R-5.4.2-007] The MCX Service shall ensure that if there is an MCX Service
Emergency Group Communication on one of the MCX Service Groups that an MCX
User is affiliated to, but that user is already in a lower priority MCX
Service Group Communication or Private Communication, that the MCX User
automatically hears/displays the MCX Service Emergency Group Communication.
[R-5.4.2-007a] Depending on meaningful elements of a functional alias the MCX
Service shall be able to restrict or allow MCX Users to be involved in more
than one MCX Service Emergency Group Communication or more than one MCX
Service Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert at a time.
[R-5.4.2-008] The MCX Service shall support reception and recording of
multiple concurrent Private Communications by an authorized user (e.g.,
dispatch operator).
[R-5.4.2-009] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism by which an MCX UE can
receive and record multiple concurrent Private Communications from MCX users
for which the current MCX User is authorized.
## 5.5 Private Communication
### 5.5.1 Private Communication general requirements
[R-5.5.1-001] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for a dispatcher or
authorized user to configure which content source shall be able to send the
content to an MCX User (e.g. video cameras near an incident).
### 5.5.2 Charging requirements for MCX Service
[R-5.5.2-001] The MCX Service shall support charging for Private
Communications.
## 5.6 MCX Service priority requirements
### 5.6.1 Overview
MCX Service Emergency Group Communications and MCX Service Imminent Peril
Group Communications are MCX Service Group Communications that provide the MCX
User elevated priority towards obtaining resources of the MCX Service system.
The MCX Service Emergency Private Communication similarly provides elevated
priority to resources of the MCX Service system. The MCX Service Emergency
Alert provides a notification of an MCX Service Emergency situation from an
MCX UE, regardless if the MCX User is signed in with the MCX Service or not.
The MCX Service Emergency Alert is initiated from an MCX UE to inform the MCX
Service of the MCX User\'s immediate need of assistance due to the MCX User\'s
personal, life-threatening situation. If the MCX User is not properly
authenticated, he/she is treated as a temporary MCX User with limited
permissions. The MCX User initiates this notification by actuating an MCX User
interface on the MCX UE. The notification to the MCX Service includes the MCX
User\'s ID, potentially an MCX Service Group ID, the user\'s Mission Critical
Organization name and the most current location available for the user\'s MCX
UE.
The MCX Service User Profile/group configuration determines which MCX Service
Group ID is used, if any. If the MCX Service User Profile indicates that a
dedicated (i.e., not used for everyday traffic) MCX Service Emergency Group is
to be used, then the MCX Service Emergency communication traffic moves to a
different group. MCX Users that support MCX Service Emergency situations
monitor the dedicated MCX Service Emergency Group(s) for communications
activity. If the MCX Service User Profile indicates that the Selected MCX
Service Group is to be used, then its MCX Service Group ID is used, unless no
group is selected for transmissions.
After the MCX User has initiated an MCX Service Emergency Alert, MCX Service
Emergency Private Communication or MCX Service Emergency Group Communication,
the MCX User is considered to be in the MCX Service Emergency State. The user
remains in the MCX Service Emergency State until the MCX User cancels the MCX
Service Emergency State.
An MCX Service Group Communication started by an MCX User while in the MCX
Service Emergency State or previously started but followed by an MCX Service
Emergency Alert becomes an MCX Service Emergency Group Communication. The MCX
Service Group ID used for the MCX Service Emergency Group Communication is the
same MCX Service Group ID included in the MCX Service Emergency Alert. An MCX
User or dispatcher might initiate an MCX Service Emergency Group Communication
without an MCX Service Emergency Alert. The start of an MCX Service Emergency
Group Communication starts an In-progress Emergency condition for the MCX
Service Group. Any subsequent MCX Service Group Communications made by any MCX
Service Group Member of an MCX Service Group, which has an In-progress
Emergency, is treated as an MCX Service Emergency Group Communication. MCX
Service Emergency Group Priority is removed when the In-progress Emergency for
the group is cancelled.
An MCX Service Private Communication started by an MCX User while in the MCX
Service Emergency State becomes an MCX Service Emergency Private
Communication.
MCX Service Imminent Peril Group Communications are differentiated from MCX
Service Emergency Group Communications based on for whom the assistance is
required. The MCX Service Emergency Group Communication is initiated by an MCX
User for assistance for the MCX Service Emergency condition involving that
user. An MCX Service Imminent Peril Group Communication is initiated by an MCX
User for assistance to other MCX Users or persons of the general public
observed to be in trouble and may soon need assistance.
There is no MCX Service Imminent Peril Alert and no MCX Service Imminent Peril
State for MCX Users. The granting of an MCX Service Imminent Peril Group
Communication starts an In-progress Imminent Peril condition for the MCX
Service Group. Any subsequent MCX Service Group Communication made by any MCX
Service Group Member of an MCX Service Group that has an In-progress Imminent
Peril condition is treated as an MCX Service Imminent Peril Group
Communication. MCX Service Imminent Peril Group Priority is removed when the
In-progress Imminent Peril for the group is cancelled.
### 5.6.2 Communication types based on priorities
#### 5.6.2.1 MCX Service Emergency and Imminent Peril general requirements
##### 5.6.2.1.1 Overview
Emergency Group Communication and Imminent Peril Group Communication are MCX
Service Group Communications that provide the MCX User elevated priority
towards obtaining resources of the MCX Service system. The MCX Service
Emergency Alert provides a notification of an MCX Service Emergency situation
from an MCX UE, regardless if the user is signed in with the MCX Service or
not. The MCX Service Emergency Alert is initiated from an MCX UE to inform the
MCX Service of the user\'s immediate need of assistance due to the user\'s
personal, life-threatening situation.
When multiple MCX Services are active in an MCX UE, the interaction of these
features between the services needs to be considered. When an MCX User
initiates an Emergency Group Communication, he/she may only want a subset of
the active MCX Services to have emergency priority. Likewise, for Imminent
Peril the North American user requirement is that only the active MCX Service
receives Imminent Peril priority when the Imminent Peril condition is
initiated. For example, if the MCX User is transmitting a video when he/she
initiates Imminent Peril, then only the MCVideo service will be granted
elevated priority.
##### 5.6.2.1.2 Requirements

## 5.9a Functional alias
5.9a.1 Overview
A functional alias is a user selectable alias that is tied to the assignment
or task of the user. A MCX User can activate one or multiple functional
aliases at the same time. The activation of the functional alias(es) will take
place after the user has signed in to the MCX Service using the MCX User ID.
The same functional alias can be assigned for use to multiple users depending
on MCX Service Administrator settings. A functional alias can be taken over by
an authorized MCX User, depending on MCX Service Administrator settings. These
two capabilities are mutually exclusive and can not be configured for the same
functional alias.
A functional alias can be used to identify for example the driver(s) of a
particular train, identified by train number and the role of the user on that
train.
Each functional alias that is active on the MCX Service system is unique for
addressing purposes. For example, if there are two drivers of TRAIN29 (e.g.
DRIVER1_TRAIN29, DRIVER2_TRAIN29), then each active functional alias should be
uniquely addressable.
A functional alias can be structured into meaningful elements (e.g.
user.agency\@organization.country, role.mission\@department.company,
function.equipment.ID\@city, label1.label2.label3\@firstname.familyname).
Based on one or more of these elements in the functional alias, specific sets
of MCX users can be selected fore.g. regrouping purposes.

### 6.6.2 Group regrouping
#### 6.6.2.1 Service description
Group regrouping enables dispatchers or any authorized user to temporarily
combine MCX Service Groups. A dispatcher uses group regrouping for different
reasons.
Due to an incident in an area it can be necessary to temporarily enable MCX
Users from different MCX Service Groups to communicate to each other to
coordinate. After the incident the dispatcher cancels the group regrouping and
the MCX Users continue with their original configured MCX Service Groups.
During quiet periods control room managers can decide to combine MCX Service
Groups and handle their operations and communications with one dispatcher. In
the busier period the group regrouping is cancelled and the MCX Service Groups
are handled by separate dispatchers.
MCX Service Groups that are being combined in a Group Regroup operation may
belong to the same or different MCX servers and may have different security
and priority levels, different floor control methods, as well as different
operational characteristics (e.g. different call start criteria, different
call or session hang timers, different transmit time limits, different
override settings, different floor control parameters such as queue depth,
queing policy and time-to-live in the queue). However, the newly created
temporary MCX Service Group can have only a single security level, priority
level, floor control method, and set of operational characteristics. The MCX
Service will apply the proper setting of those parameters for the new MCX
Service Group.
#### 6.6.2.2 Requirements
[R-6.6.2.2-001] The MCX Service shall provide a means of dynamically combining
a multiplicity of groups into a new, temporary group (i.e., to perform a
\"Group Regroup operation\").
[R-6.6.2.2-002] The MCX Service shall notify MCX Users when and how any of
their affiliated groups are affected by a Group Regroup operation including
notification of modified security, priority, floor control, and other
operational characteristics.
[R-6.6.2.2-003] The MCX Service shall provide notification and information to

security level to be set to the lowest security level of the constituent
Groups.
[R-6.6.2.2-005] The MCX Service shall notify Affiliated MCX Service Group
Members of a constituent MCX Service Group when the security level of the MCX
Service Group that they are using lowers as a result of a Group Regroup
operation.
[R-6.6.2.2-006] The MCX Service shall enable an authorized MCX User to set the
priority level of the group formed from a Group Regroup operation. Where an
MCX User does not specify the priority level the MCX Service shall default the
priority level to be set to the highest priority level of the constituent
Groups.
[R-6.6.2.2-007] Broadcast Groups shall be able to be included in a Group
Regroup operation.
[R-6.6.2.2-008] The MCX Service shall enable an authorized MCX User or MCX
Service Administrator to configure default settings and rules for the
operational characteristics of temporary MCX Service Groups resulting from
Group Regroup operations (e.g. call start criteria, hang time).
[R-6.6.2.2-009] The MCX Service shall enable an authorized MCX User to specify
the operational characteristics of temporary MCX Service Groups resulting from
Group Regroup operations either explicitly, or via pre-defined implicit rules,
or via pre-configured default values, or, in case all the constituent Groups
have in common the same operational characteristics, to use the common
settings.
[R-6.6.2.2-010] The MCX Service shall enable an authorized MCX User to set the
floor control method of the Group created from a Group Regroup operation when
the Group Regroup includes one or more groups configured for audio cut-in
operation. Where an MCX User does not specify the floor control method the MCX
Service shall default to using normal floor control for the Group Regroup
(i.e. do not use audio cut-in).
[R-6.6.2.2-011] The MCX Service shall prevent an authorized MCX User from
including a temporary group in a Group Regroup operation.
[R-6.6.2.2-012] The MCX Service shall prevent an authorized MCX User from
including a MCX Group that is already part of an existing Group Regroup in a
different Group Regroup operation.
[R-6.6.2.2-013] The MCX Service shall be configurable either to prevent or to
allow all authorized MCX Users from including a MCX Group that is in emergency
state in a Group Regroup operation.

Groups and a multiplicity of MCX Users within that MCX Service.
[R-6.6.3-002] The MCX Service shall only allow the creator of the temporary
Broadcast Group to transmit on it.
### 6.6.4 User regrouping
#### 6.6.4.1 Service description
##### 6.6.4.1.1 User regrouping controlled by dispatcher or authorized user
There is a need for a mechanism for combining MCX Users into a new MCX Service
Group under control by a dispatcher or authorized user to support ad-hoc
communication needs.
In the operational MCX Service environment, most tasks are covered by standard
procedures and communication structures, and MCX Users can easily access the
MCX Service Groups to handle their tasks.
Exceptionally it could happen that there is an urgent need for a dedicated set
of individual MCX Users to communicate in an MCX Service Group, but that this
is not foreseen in the communication structure. This could be due to extreme
conditions or due to a cooperation that is outside normal procedures.
User Regrouping enables dispatchers or authorized users to instantaneously
provide a dedicated MCX Service Group to these MCX Users to enable the
required communication. Depending on configuration the MCX Users could be
automatically affiliated to this MCX Service Group. After the operation this
MCX Service Group is removed by the dispatcher or authorized user.
##### 6.6.4.1.2 Automatic user regrouping
There is also a need to for an automatic mechanism that determines a set of
individual MCX Users to become members of a MCX Service Group and to
automatically become affiliated to that MCX Service Group.
These individual MCX Users are selected automatically by the MCX Service based
on certain parameters (e.g. location, geographic area, participant type,
direction of movement, speed). If MCX Service Group members do not meet the
parameters anymore they will automatically be de-affiliated from the MCX
Service Group and removed from the MCX Service Group member list. The
remaining MCX Service Group members and the MCX Service Group member(s)
removed will be informed accordingly. Conversely, MCX Users that are starting
to meet the parameters (e.g due to location changes) will automatically be
added and affiliated to the MCX Service Group. The MCX Service Group members
and the added MCX Service Group member(s) will be informed accordingly.
#### 6.6.4.2 Requirements
[R-6.6.4.2-001] The MCX Service shall provide a means for combining a
multiplicity of MCX Users into a new, temporary group (i.e., to perform a
\"User Regroup operation\").
[R-6.6.4.2-002] The MCX Service shall provide a means for combining a
multiplicity of MCX Users into a new, temporary group based on a parameter or
a combination of parameters (e.g., particular geographic area, Participant
type, initiation of urgent type communication such as MCX Emergency Alert or
MCX Emergency Group Communication).
[R-6.6.4.2-002a] The MCX Service shall provide a means for automatically
combining a multiplicity of MCX Users into a temporary MCX Service Group based
on certain criteria. For example, the criteria may include one or more
parameters from the list below:
\- A specific element or combination of specific elements in the functional
alias of a MCX User
\- Location (including speed and heading) of a MCX User
\- Location or particular geographic area specified by an MCX Service
Administrator
\- MCX Service configuration (e.g. MCX User responsible for a certain
geographic area or MCX User responsible for a certain MCX Service Group)
[R-6.6.4.2-002b] The MCX Service shall be able to automatically update the
memberslist of a temporary MCX Service Group based on certain criteria i.e. to
remove MCX Users no more meeting the criteria and add MCX Users starting to
meet the criteria. For example, the criteria may include one or more
parameters from the list below:
\- A specific element or combination of specific elements in the functional
alias of a MCX User
\- Location (including speed and heading) of a MCX User
\- Location or particular geographic area specified by an MCX Service
Administrator
\- MCX Service configuration (e.g. MCX User responsible for a certain
geographic area or MCX User responsible for a certain MCX Service Group)
[R-6.6.4.2-003] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism to preconfigure the
parameters for a particular User Regroup operation, such that an authorized
MCX User activates this preconfigured User Regroup and communicates with this
temporary group with minimal delay.
NOTE: An example of the use of this functionality is for an MCX User to
communicate with particular other MCX Users within a predefined radius of the
MCX User\'s Location. This functionality is likely to be for urgent type
communications such as MCX Service Emergency Group Communications.
[R-6.6.4.2-004] The MCX Service shall notify MCX Users when they are affected
by a User Regroup operation.
[R-6.6.4.2-005] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for an MCX Service
Administrator to configure whether an MCX Service system shall automatically
affiliate the MCX Users included in the temporary group created by the User
Regroup operation.
### 6.6.5 Dynamic Group Participation
#### 6.6.5.1 Service description
Dynamic group participation enables control of group affiliation, de-
affiliation, and selection on MCX Service Groups based on various combinations
of criteria. For highly mobile MCX UEs, such as those used in railway
communication, the group affiliation and selection needs to change, for
example, when a train crosses a controlling area border.
#### 6.6.5.2 Requirements

MCX User from one or more currently affiliated groups based on a change to
one, or a combination of, criteria.
[R-6.6.5.2-007] The MCX Service shall be able to prevent an MCX User de-
affiliating from specific currently affiliated groups based on one, or a
combination of, criteria.
NOTE: Examples of criteria for the above requirements could include one or
more parameters from the list below:
\- A specific element or combination of specific elements in the functional
alias of a MCX User
\- Location (including speed and heading) of a MCX User
\- Location or particular geographic area specified by an MCX Service
Administrator
\- MCX Service configuration (e.g. MCX User responsible for a certain
geographic area or MCX User responsible for a certain MCX Service Group)
[R-6.6.5.2-008] The MCX Service shall enable an MCX User to select on specific

Dispatchers from different critical communication organizations access the
same networks and network resources. Depending on the event, the priority is
given to an organization and/or a group rather than to another. For instance,
in case of a fire priority is given to the fire brigades dealing with it,
while in case of a criminal arrest priority is given to the police officers in
charge of the arrest.

## 6.13 Security
### 6.13.1 Overview
Security covers areas designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of information that is processed, stored, and transmitted. The
security requirements listed here cover the areas of cryptographic protocols,
authentication, access control, regulatory issues and storage control.
### 6.13.2 Cryptographic protocols
[R-6.13.2-001] The MCX Service shall employ open cryptographic standards,
subject to applicable local policy (e.g., Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) 140-2).
[R-6.13.2-002] The MCX Service shall allow for update to new cryptographic
operations and methods without making obsolete existing operations and
methods, or requiring upgrade of all user equipment simultaneously.
[R-6.13.2-003] The MCX Service shall allow for the coexistence of a
multiplicity of cryptographic suites.
NOTE 1: A \"cryptographic suite\" is a consistent collection of cryptographic
operations (e.g., encryption and message authentication) spanning the totality
of required cryptographic operations for MCX Service. That is, if MCX Service
requires a stream cipher, a message authentication code, and a secure hash,
then counter-mode AES-256, CMAC with AES-256 as an underlying cipher, and
SHA-512 would constitute a cryptographic suite for MCX Service.
NOTE 2: The definition and identification of cryptographic suites and
algorithms need not all be within the scope of 3GPP.
### 6.13.3 Authentication
[R-6.13.3-001] The MCX Service shall provide a means by which an MCX UE can
require authentication of the MCX Service.

transmitting in one MCX Private Communication (without Floor control) while
simultaneously receiving transmissions from other MCX Private Communications
(with Floor control) within the same MCX service.
## 6.15 Additional services for MCX Service communications
### 6.15.1 Discreet listening capabilities
[R-6.15.1-001a] The MCX Service shall provide discreet listening capabilities
without noticeable impact on or knowledge of the target MCX User, or the
members of the target MCX Service Group including Ad hoc groups, and all other
unauthorized MCX Users.

[R-6.15.1-004] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for an authorized MCX
User to receive MCX Service Group transmissions from a specific MCX Service
Group that is within the authority of the authorized MCX User.
NOTE: Permission to activate discreet listening can include multiple levels of
authorization, but this is outside the scope of 3GPP.
### 6.15.2 Ambient listening
#### 6.15.2.1 Overview of ambient listening
Ambient listening is a feature that allows an authorized MCX User, typically a
dispatcher, to cause an MCX UE to initiate a communication which results in no
indication on the MCX UE that it is transmitting. Ambient listening can be
initiated by an authorized MCX User who wants to be \"listened\" to by another
remote authorized MCX User or can be initiated by a remote authorized MCX User
who wants to \"listen\" to another MCX User. The purpose of this feature
allows a dispatcher to \"listen\" to activities at the Location of the remote
MCX UE to find out what is happening around that MCX UE without providing an
indication to the MCX User or people around the user (whom the MCX User does
not want to make aware of this action) that this is happening. This type of
communication is different from other types of communications, as for ambient
listening information is only transmitted to one party in the communication
(i.e., a dispatcher or an authorized MCX User that is acting in a similar role
to a dispatcher).
This is used for stolen MCX UEs, monitoring officers, officer safety and
particular operations, where it is important that the MCX UE does not indicate
what is happening.
#### 6.15.2.2 Ambient listening requirements
##### 6.15.2.2.1 General ambient listening requirements
[R-6.15.2.2.1-001] The MCX UE that is being listened to shall be the only
transmitting party in the Private Communication.
[R-6.15.2.2.1-002] For an MCX UE that is being listened to there shall be no
indication on the MCX UE that it is transmitting.
[R-6.15.2.2.1-003] If someone attempts to turn off an MCX UE that is being
listened to it shall appear to be turned off even while Ambient Listening
continues to be active.
##### 6.15.2.2.2 Remotely initiated ambient listening requirements
[R-6.15.2.2.2-001] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism to allow an MCX
Service Administrator and/or an authorized user to set up Ambient Listening on
a remote MCX UE within their authority.
[R-6.15.2.2.2-002] The MCX Service shall ensure that Ambient Listening
triggered remotely is terminated only by the remote authorized MCX User (e.g.,
a dispatcher).
##### 6.15.2.2.3 Locally initiated ambient listening requirements
[R-6.15.2.2.3-001] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism to allow an
authorized MCX User to use the MCX UE that the MCX User is currently using to
initiate Ambient Listening to another authorized MCX User (e.g., a
dispatcher).
[R-6.15.2.2.3-002] The MCX Service shall ensure that Ambient Listening
triggered locally can be terminated by the MCX User being listened to or by
the remote MCX Service Administrator and/or authorized user, who was the
listening Participant.
### 6.15.3 Remotely initiated MCX Service Communication
#### 6.15.3.1 Overview
A Remotely initiated MCX Service Communication is a feature that allows an
authorized user, typically a dispatcher, to cause a remote MCX UE to initiate
a communication by itself, without its user explicitly initiating the
communication manually. The purpose of this feature allows the dispatcher to
\"listen\" to activities at the Location of the remote MCX UE to find out what
is happening around that MCX UE. This feature is also known as \"Remote Unit
Monitoring\" in P25 systems.
There are two typical use cases for this feature.
The first one is the case where a user could have been incapacitated. This
could be both accidentally, say a traffic accident, or deliberately, for
example a violent attack. In both cases it would be necessary to remotely
initiate a communication from the MCX UE in order to allow another user or a
group of users to \"listen\" to what is happening to prepare assistance. The
communication that is set up is either a Private Communication or a Group
Communication, and the communication could optionally be visible to the remote
MCX UE\'s user.
The second one is the case of a stolen MCX UE. Here it is just necessary to
activate the MCX UE so that a dispatcher can \"listen\" to any background
communication in order to make an analysis of the situation. In this
situation, the initiation of the communication from the remote MCX UE,
typically a Private Communication in that case, is not visible by that MCX
UE\'s user.
Other use cases, such as undercover operations, discreet surveillance of users
or investigations, could exist depending on the missions of the critical
communications users and on legislations.
The behaviour of the remotely initiated Communication is not different from a
normal communication initiated by the local MCX User. The same rules for
resource allocation and interactions with other services apply, but the
initiator of the feature can have the capability to request a pre-emptive or
high priority for that Communication to ensure it is set up even in case of
resource congestion or to limit disturbance by other services.
#### 6.15.3.2 Requirements
[R-6.15.3.2-001] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for an MCX Service

alias(es) and User and Group Regroup operations.
[R-6.15.4-008] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for a Mission
Critical Organization to log at least the following metadata per non-
communication activity: time, date, MCX Service User identity, activity type
and pertinent information about the activity (e.g. MCX User/Group ID(s)
included in the temporary group created by the User/Group Regroup operation).
The following metadata should be logged if applicable to the activity type:
MCX Service Group ID, Location information of the MCX User, affiliation list,
target MCX Service User ID and success/failure indication.
[R-6.15.4-009] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for a Mission
Critical Organization to log metadata for all failed authorization attempts
(e.g., invalid login password) by an MCX User.

services, loss of signal, failed registration attempts).
[R-6.15.4-011] The MCX Service shall provide recording and audit functions for
all types of MCX Service group communication (e.g., normal group, regroup
group, Ad hoc group).
### 6.15.5 MCX Service Ad hoc Group Communication
#### 6.15.5.1 Overview
Due to an incident in an area, or a special operation, it can be necessary to
coordinate MCX Users using Group Communication where these users do not
normally work together and do not share any groups in common. MCX Service Ad
hoc Group Communication enables authorized users to combine a random set of
MCX Users into a group communication. The main characteristics of this ad hoc
group communication are:
a) The ad hoc group does not exist until it is spontaneously created during
the communication.
b) The ad hoc group ceases to exist when the communication terminates.
A single communication consists of one or more media transmissions until
explicitly terminated by various means. MCX Users that are being combined in
an ad hoc group communication may be served by the same or different MCX
systems and may normally use MCX Service Groups with different security and
priority levels, different floor control methods, and other different
operational characteristics. The MCX Service Ad hoc Group Communication will
use a common security level, priority level, floor control method, and set of
operational characteristics for the participants during a communication. As
with any group communication, the priority level can change dynamically.
The ad hoc group is used for a single communication and it does not persist
when the communication is terminated. Authorized users can recreate the ad hoc
group for subsequent communications, or request creation of a permanent MCX
Service Group from the participants in the ad hoc group communication.
NOTE: When the MCX Service Ad hoc Communication is terminated the list of
participants may be retained for ease of initiating another ad hoc
communication with the same participants.
#### 6.15.5.2 General aspects
[R-6.15.5.2-001] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for an authorized
MCX User to combine an ad hoc multiplicity of MCX Users into a MCX Service Ad
hoc Group Communication.
NOTE: Selection of the list of MCX Users can be manual, or automatic based on
certain criteria (e.g., location). This is left for implementation.
[R-6.15.5.2-002] An MCX Service Ad hoc Group Communication is a type of MCX
Service Group communication and shall support MCX Service Group Communication
mechanisms for call processing (e.g., transmit request queuing, hang time,
broadcast mode).
[R-6.15.5.2-003] MCX Service Ad hoc Group Communications shall be terminated
using the same mechanisms as MCX Service Group communications (e.g., initiator
release, server release, hang time expiration).
[R-6.15.5.2-004] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for an MCX Service
Administrator to configure additional conditions under which MCX Service Ad
hoc Group Communication shall be terminated (e.g., last Participant leaving,
second last Participant leaving, initiator leaving).
[R-6.15.5.2-005] When an MCX Service Ad hoc Group Communication is terminated
the group shall not persist.
[R-6.15.5.2-006] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for the initiator
of a MCX Service Ad hoc Group Communication to indicate which MCX Users have
to mandatorily acknowledge the setup request before the media transmission
proceeds.
[R-6.15.5.2-007] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for an authorized

### 6.15.6 MCX Service Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert
#### 6.15.6.1 Overview
Due to an incident in an area, or a special operation, it can be necessary to
coordinate MCX Users using Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert where these users do
not normally work together and do not share any groups in common. MCX Service
Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert enables authorized users to combine a random set
of MCX Users based on criteria into a group and to send an emergency alert to
this set of MCX Users.
The main characteristics of the Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert are:
a) The ad hoc group does not exist until it is spontaneously created at the
initiation of the Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert.
b) After initiation of the Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert the MCX User may be
put into the MCX Service Emergency State.
c) After initiation of the Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert the resulting ad hoc
group may be used for group communications.
d) The ad hoc group ceases to exist when the group communications in the ad
hoc group have terminated, and the Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert has been
cancelled.
An authorised user is able to:
a) Initiate an MCX Service Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert with participants
satisfying specific criteria,
b) Cancel an MCX Service Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert,
During an ongoing MCX Service Ad hoc Group Emergency Alert, the set of MCX
Users may change dynamically based on these criteria (e.g., criteria may not
longer be met, or criteria may be met for additional MCX users, and as a
result users are removed from or added to the ongoing Ad hoc Group Emergency
Alert).

## 6.19 Additional MCX Service requirements
### 6.19.1 Communication rejection and queuing
Requests to transmit appear in MCX Services in many forms and under many
circumstances. Normally, requests to transmit are accompanied by priority
information that is used to arbitrate the decision to assign resources for the
transmission amongst competing requests to transmit. Upon arrival, a request
to transmit is immediately granted, rejected, or queued. If queued, a request
to transmit is normally granted when conditions which caused the queue are
removed, or it can be dropped automatically for a number of reasons, or it can
be cancelled by an authorized user who is usually the initiator of the request
to transmit. When a request to transmit is rejected, it can be re-requested
either manually by user action or automatically.

# 7 MCX Service requirements specific to off-network use
## 7.1 Off-network communications overview
The MCX Service while operating in off-network mode comprises a set or
collection of functions necessary to provide Mission Critical Services (e.g.,
MCPTT, MCVideo, MCData, etc.) using a ProSe direct (UE-to-UE) Communication
path (ProSe direct communication path) for transport. The ProSe direct
communication path does not traverse the network infrastructure.
Users operating off the network are either out of network coverage (not served
by a 3GPP network) (e.g., in a remote mountain area fighting a forest fire 20
miles from the nearest network) or have selected a ProSe direct communication
path for MCX Service while in network coverage. MCX Users operating off the
network need to be in ProSe direct communication range in order to
communicate.
NOTE 1: While the network is likely to be a primary, reliable transport of MCX
Service communications, there are many situations where MCX Service
communications are needed in areas where the network is not available, or
coverage is not reliable.
MCX Users outside of the coverage of the fixed network might be first
responders in a rural area assisting in a response to a plane crash, fire
fighters in a remote mountain area fighting a forest fire or police officers
inside a residence responding to a domestic issue. Off-network MCX Service
communications are expected to be immediately accessible to users in the
absence of the network.
MCX Users in network coverage might be working in a confined area, such as
fire fighters fighting a structure fire where direct UE-to-UE communication is
more desirable and reliable. Users can communicate directly with one another
without having to overcome the resistance of a building and distance to the
nearest base station to communicate with other members of their team inside
the building that are nearby.
To operate off the network, an MCX UE is capable of automatically switching to
a ProSe direct communication path for use of MCX Services when detecting an
off-network (out of coverage) condition. In addition, a mechanism is provided
for an authorized user to select (manually switch to) a ProSe direct
communication path for use of off-network MCX Service communications (e.g.,
while in network coverage).
When operating off the network, the MCX Service is provided by the MCX Service
Application on the UE as compared to operations on the network, where the MCX
Service Application on the UE interacts with an MCX Service server and the
network to provide the MCX Service.
NOTE 2: For MCX UEs that have selected a ProSe Direct Communication path for
use of MCX Services while in network coverage, signalling with the network and
MCX Service might be available (e.g., radio resource allocation, MCX Service
User Profile management updates and cryptographic key management updates),
while the MCX User transmissions would be direct between the MCX UEs (e.g.,
not traversing the network).
The Off-Network MCX Service builds upon ProSe enablers to establish, maintain
and terminate the signalling and communication path(s) among the off-network
users. To the extent feasible, it is expected that the end user\'s experience
is similar regardless if the MCX Service is used with a 3GPP network or based
on the use of a ProSe direct communication path.
The Off-Network MCX Service is intended to support communication between a
group of users (a group communication), where each user has the ability to
gain access to transmit in an arbitrated manner. However, the MCX Service also
supports Private Communications between pairs of users.
When operating off the network the MCX Service allows users to request the
permission to transmit (transmit voice/audio) and provides a deterministic
mechanism to arbitrate between requests that are in contention (i.e., Floor
control).
The Off-Network MCX Service provides a means for a user with higher priority
(e.g., MCX Service Emergency condition) to override (interrupt) the current
sender. The Off-Network MCX Service also supports a mechanism to limit the
time a user transmits (has access to the resources) thus permitting users of
the same or lower priority a chance to gain access to the resources.
The Off-Network MCX Service provides the means for a user to monitor activity
on a number of separate communications and enables the user to switch focus to
a chosen communication. An Off-Network MCX User might join an already
established MCX Service Group Communication (Late communication entry). In
addition the Off-Network MCX Service supports MCX Service User IDs, aliases
and user Location determination features.
For operation off the network (e.g., when out of network coverage), an MCX UE
is (pre-)provisioned by an MCX Service Administrator and/or authorized user
with the following in order to use MCX Services:
a) An MCX Service User Profile associated with each of the intended MCX Users
of the MCX UE that might be used for off-network operation;
1) An alphanumeric identifier (with a minimum length of Nc3) (i.e., alias) for
each MCX User;
2) A number of off-network MCX Service Groups for use by the MCX User;
3) An alphanumeric identifier (i.e., alias) for the authorized off-network MCX
Service Groups;
4) A Mission Critical Organization name if available, associated with each of
the intended MCX Users or Administrator;
5) A number of off-network MCX Users for Private Communications for which the
MCX User is authorized;
b) Authentication and end-to-end security keys.
NOTE 3: MCX UEs can be provisioned for off-network use by either configuration
outside of network coverage or by attaching to the network.
An MCX UE operating off the network is capable of transmitting the sender's
Location information, MCX Service User ID, alias(es), off-network MCX Service
Group ID, group alias and, if available, Mission Critical Organization name of
the user who is transmitting (i.e., whose UE is transmitting) to all other
users in a communication including MCX UEs operating off the network that are
late entering a communication in progress.
The Off-Network MCX Service uses the capabilities defined in ProSe TS 22.278
[5], including the ProSe Relay capabilities defined in ProSe TS 22.278 [5] and
GCSE_LTE TS 22.468 [6].
NOTE 4: As indicated in TS 22.278 [5] use of a ProSe Direct Communication path
outside of network coverage is only applicable for Public Safety ProSe enabled
UEs. For non-Public Safety ProSe enabled UEs the selection of the most
appropriate communication path (ProSe Communication path (direct or routed via
local basestation) or 3GPP network path) is under network control and based on
operator preferences.
MCX Service requirements specific to off-network use are defined in clause 7.
Common MCX Service requirements defined in clause 5 apply whether the MCX
Service is in use on the network or off the network.
## 7.2 General off-network MCX Service requirements

of the MCX UE that might be used for off-network operation:
1) alphanumeric identifier (i.e., Alias ID) for the authorized off-network MCX
Service Groups;
2) a number of off-network MCX Service Groups for use by an MCX User;
3) a MCX Service User ID associated with each of the intended MCX Users;
4) an alphanumeric identifier (with a minimum length of Nc3) (i.e., alias) for
each MCX Service User ID.
b) authentication and end to end security keys.

# 8 Inter-MCX Service interworking
## 8.1 Inter-MCX Service interworking overview
Clause 8 describes interworking of one MCX Service with another.
The MCData Service as defined in TS 22.282 [3] includes description of
multiple independent applications and data transfer capabilities, which may
themselves be subject to interworking limitations as identified in clause 8.
Therefore, requirements in clause 8 should be used as guidance for MCData
interworking between individual applications within that one MCX Service.
## 8.2 Concurrent operation of different MCX Services
### 8.2.1 Overview
In some cases, a User or UE will use multiple independent MCX Services. The
intention in this case is that each service will operate totally independently
of the other services and should not cause service, capability or capacity
interaction problems. It is understood that different UE may have different
abilities to cope with the demands of simultaneous services. The requirements
in sub-clause 8.2.2 identify how to handle simultaneous services which are
intended to be completely independent of each other but limits in total
capacity to handle multiple services and multiple instances within a service
is left for suppliers to characterise for their products.
Where independent functionality between services is constrained due to
transport capacity limitations, those requirements are indicated in the sub-
clause on Priority between Services.
When the constraint is due to the service itself (e.g. Audio embedded within a
video and MCPTT speech both delivering audible signals) any potential conflict
may be avoided by action in the network part of the service but these actions
are not specified. In sub-clause 8.2.2 actions taken by a single UE in case of
conflict not resolved in the network are specified.
### 8.2.2 Requirements
[R-8.2.2-001] Except where expressly stated each MCX Service shall operate
independently of each other MCX Service.
[R-8.2.2-002] Any floor control facility remains completely independent for
each of simultaneous MCX Services except where expressly stated.
[R-8.2.2-003] A user shall be able to transmit on one MCX Service and receive
on another without service interaction limitations.
[R-8.2.2-004] A user shall be able to transmit on different MCX Services at
essentially the same time without service interaction limitations.
[R-8.2.2-005] A user shall be able to receive on different MCX Services at
essentially the same time without service interaction limitations except where
services are competing for the same unsharable resource which may include the
display, audio transducers, etc.
[R-8.2.2-006] When operating multiple MCX Services on the same network, radio
resources shall be able to be utilized in an efficient manner for all MCX
Services up to certain thresholds defined for each MCX Service and/or the
combination of MCX Services. The radio resource allocation for each MCX
Service and the combination of MCX Services shall be flexible based on demand,
or allocated in a predefined manner.
[R-8.2.2-007] The network shall be able to assign radio resources so that
resources assigned to each MCX Service, or the combination of all MCX Services
stays below a threshold, subject to the agreement between the 3GPP network
operator and the Mission Critical Organization(s) (e.g., 3GPP network can be
operated by Mission Critical Organization(s), or 3GPP network is operated by
commercial operator), for resources to be used for MCX Services without
impacting other non-MCX Services.
## 8.3 Use of unsharable resources within a UE
[R-8.3-001] An MCX UE should be able to present audio from multiple sources
(e.g. MCVideo, MCPTT) in a manner that is easily distinguished.
[R-8.3-002] An MCX UE may enable the user (e.g. incident commander) to control
the relative volumes and spatial rendering of concurrent audio sources (e.g.
MCVideo, MCPTT) at the UE.
[R-8.3-003] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for a MCX User to
prioritize the use of contended resources (e.g. display, loudspeaker) in the
UE (e.g. most recently selected MCX Service, MCPTT voice always has priority).
[R-8.3-004] Communication marked as Emergency or Imminent Peril shall take
priority use of contended resources in the UE over communication not marked as
Emergency or Imminent Peril.
[R-8.3-005] When a MCX Service is denied access to contended resource in the
UE, an indication shall be given to the User to alert them of the situation.
[R-8.3-006] When a MCX Service is denied access to contended resource in the
UE, a facility shall be provided for the User to select their preferred MCX
Service for access to contended resources for the duration of the limitation.
## 8.4 Single group with multiple MCX Services
### 8.4.1 Overview
It is useful to be able to configure any single group to be able to handle
multiple MCX Services. In sub-clause 8.4 requirements are on the service to
provide a solution that looks as though the services are working in a coupled
and coordinated manner. The exact means of achieving this is not implied here.
So, where a User may affiliate to a single group for two services, this could
be a single affiliation indicating two services but handled together or it
could be that the UE sends two affiliations, one for each service, in response
to the single command to affiliate. There may also be other possibilities. In
essence, the solution should look and feel like a combined service.
### 8.4.2 Requirements
[R-8.4.2-001] Mission critical groups shall be able to use multiple MCX
Services independently or in combination.
[R-8.4.2-002] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism by which an authorized
MCX User can affiliate to a mission critical group using that MCX Service
through a single logical group affiliation for any subset of MCX Services used
by the group, or independently by MCX Service.
[R-8.4.2-003] To support operation coordinated between mission critical
services, an MCX Service used by a mission critical group shall be able to
interact with another MCX Service used by the same group.
[R-8.4.2-004] To support combined services where the operation is intended to
be coordinated, each MCX Service shall be able to apply similar geographic
restrictions in use for one MCX Service to also operate in the coordinated MCX
Service(s).
[R-8.4.2-005] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism by which an authorized
MCX User who is affiliated to multiple MCX Services in a single group can de-
affiliate specific MCX UEs from each MCX Service independently.
### 8.4.3 Compatibility of UE
#### 8.4.3.1 Advertising service capabilities required
[R-8.4.3.1-001] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism by which an MCX User
of a UE can only affiliate to a Common MCX Service Group(s) for MCX Services
that the MCX User's UE is capable of supporting.
[R-8.4.3.1-002] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism to advertise the
service capabilities required to participate in a group e.g. choice of codec
so that an MCX User can check the UE's compatibility before attempting to
affiliate.
[R-8.4.3.1-003] The MCX Service shall provide a mechanism for a UE to
advertise its capability and limitation information when its MCX User
affiliates to a group.
NOTE: For example when an MCX User affiliates to an MCVideo group, the MCX
User's UE may indicate the codecs and coding rates supported so that the
MCVideo service will ensure that the UE receives video that it can render.
[R-8.4.3.1-004] If the MCX User affiliates to a group, but its UE does not
provide capability and limitation information, then the MCX Service shall
assume that any MCX Service relevant content can be handled by that UE.
#### 8.4.3.2 Conversion between capabilities
[R-8.4.3.2-001] Where an MCX Service does not advertise the service
capabilities required to participate in a group it is assumed that service
capability itself is sufficient to take part in the group. For example if a
specific codec is being used and a joining UE may not support that codec then
the service will provide transcoding for UEs that support the service but do
not support the codec.
### 8.4.4 Individual permissions for service access
[R-8.4.4-001] When a UE makes a combined request to affiliate to a Common MCX
Service Group the MCX Service may respond by permitting access to the group
for some but not all MCX Services if appropriate.
### 8.4.5 Common alias and user identities or mappable
[R-8.4.5-001] To support combined services where the operation is intended to
be coordinated, it shall be possible for one MCX Service to access and
communicate using user identifying information in use for a coordinated MCX
Service.
### 8.4.6 Single location message
[R-8.4.6-001] The MCX Service shall provide configuration and capability so
that when a UE is affiliated to a Common MCX Service Group and some or all of
the MCX Services periodically require location messages to be sent then each
location message sent may be configured to apply to all MCX Services or to
only one specific MCX Service.
[R-8.4.6-002] The MCX Service shall provide configuration and capability so
that when a UE is affiliated to multiple groups and some or all of the groups
periodically require location messages to be sent then each location message
sent may be configured to apply to all affiliated groups or may be applied to
only one specific group.
[R-8.4.6-003] The MCX Service shall provide configuration and capability so
that when a UE is affiliated to multiple Common MCX Service Groups and some or
all of the Common MCX Service Groups periodically require location messages to
be sent then each location message sent may be configured to apply to all
Common MCX Service Groups or may be applied to only one specific Common MCX
Service Group.
## 8.5 Priority between services
### 8.5.1 Overview
The 3GPP priority system using ARP and QCI is expected to be used for relative
priority treatment among communications at the transport level. Further
application of priority will be invoked in and by the MCX Service system
according to service related requirements e. g User and situation
### 8.5.2 Requirements
[R-8.5.2-001] For on network communications, priority management shall manage
all data flows from the different mission critical services together when
applying priority decisions.
NOTE 1: No mission critical service is considered as always having priority
over another.
[R-8.5.2-002] For off network communications, priority management shall manage
all data flows from the different mission critical services together when
applying priority decisions.
NOTE 2: No mission critical service is considered as always having priority
over another.
[R-8.5.2-003] The MCX Service systems shall provide a mechanism to dynamically
prioritize one MCX Service over another.
[R-8.5.2-004] The MCX Services, in coordination with each other, shall be able
to give appropriate priorities to the different communications according to
User, content type, device type, participant type and operational situation.
[R-8.5.2-005] MCX Services shall notify users of actions taken by the
dispatcher that result in a change in priority for a data flow.
# 9 Air ground air Communication
## 9.1 Service Description
Mission critical users use aircrafts and helicopters for operational purpose.
Being able to communicate in real time with helicopters and aircraft is a
basic need.
Some traffic assumptions are provided in Annex D.
## 9.2 Requirements
[R-9.2-001] The MCX Service shall support Air ground air Communication up to
15.000 ft with a speed up to [450]km/h.
# 10 MCX Service in IOPS mode
[R-10-001] An MCX Service shall be able to provide services when operating in
a 3GPP network in IOPS mode.
NOTE: Services may be reduced for example due to lack of back haul.

###### ## Annex D (informative): Characteristics and traffic assumptions for
air ground air communications
The mission critical air ground air communications will be used as described
below.
# D.1 Environment
Helicopters are used for rescue and providing reconnaissance information to
support events/incidents in rural (including mountains) environments and urban
environments. Helicopters are also used for rescue and providing
reconnaissance support for events/incidents in the ocean within a limited
range of land or ship.
Planes are often used in rural (including forests and mountains) environment,
but they can also be used in and near urban areas.
# D.2 Altitudes
Helicopters have an altitude of 1.500 ft in general but in mountains it goes
up to 15.000 ft.
Planes have an altitude between 2.000 ft and 15.000 ft.
The system will have to operate from 500 ft above ground level/above the sea
with service continuity between ground communications and air ground air
communications.
# D.3 Maximum speed and mobility
Helicopters are moving at a speed of 250 km/h, planes are moving at 450 km/h.
The ascent and descent speed are up to 1.000 ft per minute.
# D.4 Traffic assumptions
For a region of 90.000 km2, a minimum of 18 communications per regions are
supported with at least 6 simultaneous communications for helicopters and at
least 6 simultaneous communications for planes.
