# 1 Scope
This document specifies the common functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support mission critical services including the
common services core architecture.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2], 3GPP
TS 22.280 [3], 3GPP TS 22.281 [4] and 3GPP TS 22.282 [5].
The present document is applicable primarily to mission critical services
using E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401
[17]. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and administrative
functions could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks but no
additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.
The common functional architecture to support mission critical services can be
used for public safety applications and also for general commercial
applications e.g. utility companies and railways.

# 4 Introduction
A common functional architecture to support MC services (i.e., MCPTT defined
in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], MCVideo defined in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12], MCData defined
in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]) including common application plane and signalling
plane entities is specified in this document. It also deals with the
functional architecture of the MC gateway UE to enable access to the MC system
from MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices. A subset of these devices can
host an MC client specified by 3GPP.
Each MC service supports several types of communications amongst the users
(e.g. group call, private call). There are several common functions and
entities (e.g. group, configuration, identity) which are used by the MC
services.
The common functional architecture to support MC services utilises aspects of
the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9], the Proximity-based
Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [18] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS
23.237 [10].
The MC service UE primarily obtains access to a MC service via E-UTRAN, using
the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]. Certain MC service
functions such as dispatch and administrative functions can be supported using
either MC service UEs in E-UTRAN or using MC service UEs via non-3GPP access
networks. External applications usage of MC services can be enabled via
E-UTRAN or non-3GPP access networks.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MC service administrators are
considered MC service UEs in the common functional architecture to support MC
services.
# 5 Assumptions and architectural requirements
## 5.1 Assumptions
### 5.1.1 Service continuity
Service continuity shall be supported between on-network MC services and UE-
to-network relay MC services. The following 3GPP TS 23.237 [9] procedures are
needed:
\- Originating sessions that use only PS media flow(s) as defined in subclause
6.2.1.3.
\- Terminations sessions that use only PS media flow(s) as defined in
subclause 6.2.2.3.
\- Remote Leg Update as defined in subclause 6.3.1.5.
\- PS-PS Access Transfer with full media transfer as defined in subclause
6.2.2.1.
The MC service UE, prior to going out of E-UTRAN coverage, should attempt to
make use of a ProSe UE-to-network relay to support service continuity.
### 5.1.2 Trust domain
For an MC system, the trust domain consists of one or more MC service
functions that are administered by the same or different service providers
(e.g. MC service provider, PLMN operator) that have an agreement to share
sensitive information.
For the MC system architecture, the following rules are implied for functions
in different trust domains:
\- A public user identity shall not identify an MC service user in a different
trust domain (see subclause 8.3.1);
\- A public service identity shall not identify an MC service group ID in a
different trust domain (see subclause 8.3.2);
\- A SIP database shall not pass responses to a registrar or registrar finder
in a different trust domain (see subclause 7.4.3.2.1); and
\- An HTTP proxy shall not pass requests or responses to another HTTP proxy,
an HTTP server or an HTTP client in a different trust domain (see subclause
7.4.3.3.2).
## 5.2 Architectural requirements
### 5.2.1 General architectural requirements
General MC service architectural requirements include:
a) To develop economies of scale, it will be useful if PLMN operators can
reuse the MC service architecture for non-public safety customers that require
similar functionality. These PLMN operators may want to integrate many
components of the MC service solution with their existing network
architecture.
Hence a functional decomposition of MC service architecture into distinct
logical functions is required.
b) The MC service architecture should enable an application plane and
signalling control plane split for the provisioning of the MC service.
c) To enable parts of the MC service architecture to be shared for other
applications, the architecture should enable the group management functions
(e.g. admission control; linking of groups;) to be implemented on a separate
node from the main application functions of the MC service (e.g. \"call\"
setup/termination; allocation of TMGI to UE; floor control;).
d) There is a need to promptly form (and release) groups of users that span
multiple public safety network administrations. To enable this, the MC service
architecture should provide the relevant interfaces between public safety
networks.
### 5.2.2 PLMN change requirements
The MC applications can provide MC services to users in various PLMNs. An MC
service UE may connect to PLMNs using EPC-level roaming, IMS-level roaming or
local subscription.
For EPC-level roaming, in order to prioritize for network selection PLMNs that
allow migration to partner MC systems, the MC service UE\'s User Preferred
PLMN Selector list (see 3GPP TS 22.011 [28]) may be configured with a list of
PLMNs that can be used to migrate to one or more partner MC systems (see
subclause 5.2.9.2).
### 5.2.3 UE-to-network relay MC service requirements
To support the requirement that a public safety ProSe UE-to-network relay
shall be able to restrict the relayed group communication on a per group
basis, the MC service should be able to provide a means for an MC service
administrator to configure a ProSe UE-to-network relay with a list of allowed
MC service groups. For each allowed MC service group, a unique associated
relay service code should be allocated and it may be provided to the relay UE
from MC service server or DPF.
NOTE: According to the PLMN operator\'s configuration, one relay service code
can map to one or multiple MC service group(s).
### 5.2.4 MC service user profile requirements
The MC service user profile shall:
\- be provisioned subject to the user authentication by the identity
management server;
\- be available at configuration management server;
\- be available at MC service servers with the corresponding user profile
information;
\- be associated with an MC service user; and
\- contain an index to uniquely distinguish the MC service user profile from
other MC service user profiles associated to the same MC service user.
For the set of MC service user profiles associated to a single MC service
user, one of the MC service user profiles shall be indicated as the pre-
selected MC service user profile to the MC service client and the MC service
server.
The MC service user shall be able to:
\- change the pre-selected MC service user profile; and
\- change the selected MC service user profile.
The MC service user profile may be modified at the configuration management
server.
### 5.2.5 MC service group affiliation and MC service group de-affiliation
The MC system shall support affiliation and de-affiliation to an MC service
group for one or more MC services. For affiliation and de-affiliation, the MC
service client shall indicate interest in one or more MC services for the MC
service group. For a single MC service group configured for multiple MC
services, the affiliation and de-affiliation shall be performed as per the MC
service selected by the MC service user. For individual MC service group
affiliation and MCservice group de-affiliation, the requirements are specified
in the corresponding MC service TS.
NOTE 1: A combined affiliation to multiple MC services for a single MC service
group is not specified in the current document.
MC service group affiliation can be achieved through the following two
methods:
a) Explicit affiliation: An MC service client indicates interest in one or
many MC service groups to the MC service server. This interest may be
initiated either by an MC service user using the MC service UE, or by an
automatic procedure within the MC service client that indicates that the MC
service user is interested in the MC service group at that MC service client.
An authorized MC service user may remotely modify another MC service user\'s
affiliation to an MC service group.
b) Implicit affiliation: An MC service user\'s affiliations to MC service
groups are determined through configurations and policies within the MC
service and performed by the associated MC service server.
NOTE 2: MC service group affiliation is not the same as MC service group
membership; however, an MC service user is a member of an MC service group
prior to becoming an affiliated member of that MC service group.
The MC service server may refuse a request for affiliation from an MC service
user to an MC service group, in which case the MC service user will be unable
to take part in the requested MC service associated with that MC service
group, and the MC service client should make the MC service user aware that
the MC service user is not affiliated to the MC service group for the
requested MC service. The MC service server may also de-affiliate an MC
service client from an MC service group following a relevant trigger
condition.
MC service group de-affiliation indicates that the MC service user is no
longer interested in that MC service group, either at the MC service client,
or across all MC service clients depending on MC service group configuration,
and therefore is unable to perform any actions that are associated with an
affiliated member (e.g. receive media, notifications). MC service group
de‑affiliation can occur due to either an MC service client\'s explicit
request, or implicitly i.e. changed by the MC service server as the result of
another action e.g. the MC service user logging off. When the MC service user
is logged off from the MC service, all affiliations shall be revoked in the MC
service server even if no explicit de-affiliation signalling is sent.
Editor\'s note: The interaction of logoff and de-affiliation when moving to
off network case is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The MC service server may track logoff state independent of
affiliation and is FFS.
NOTE 3: When the MC service user next performs successful service
authorization, re-affiliation occurs in the MC service server without explicit
affiliation signalling for all MC service groups that are configured for
implicit affiliation after service authorization.
NOTE 4: The MC service client may also store MC service groups to which the MC
service user was affiliated prior to that user logging off, and may re-
affiliate through an explicit affiliation to these groups following the next
service authorization. Such a function is outside the scope of the present
document.
### 5.2.6 GCS AS requirements for the MC services
Point to multipoint broadcast offered by the LTE MBMS technology is well
suited to group communications, which form a major part of the public safety
related communications. The MC service on-network architecture, is based in
part on 3GPP TS 23.468 [18] with the MC service server assuming the function
of the GCS AS and can be represented (in a simplified diagram) as shown in
figure 5.2.6-1:
Figure 5.2.6-1: MC service on-network architecture showing MBMS
The MC service server is shown being bundled with the GCS AS within the same
network entity. It is illustrated this way for simplicity of the diagram.
MC service media content is transmitted via LTE bearers, which are
communication pipes with one end in the MC service server and the other end in
the MC service UE. The uplink bearers are always allocated as unicast, but the
downlink bearers can be allocated as unicast or as MBMS bearers, or both.
An MBMS bearer (both network and radio part) is uniquely identified via a TMGI
or via a combination of a TMGI and a flow identifier (see 3GPP TS 23.246
[11]). The MC service server is capable, via the MB2 interface, to request the
creation of MBMS bearers and associate a unique TMGI or a combination of a
TMGI and a flow identifier (see 3GPP TS 23.468 [18]). The MC service server
may determine the MBMS broadcast area based on the cell identities of the
affiliated group members received over GC1. The MC service server may
determine for a user the switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer based on
the information reported over GC1.
### 5.2.7 Bearer management
#### 5.2.7.0 General
The MC service UE shall use the following APNs:
\- an MC services APN for the SIP-1 reference point;
\- an MC common core services APN for the HTTP-1 reference point; and
\- an MC identity management service APN for the CSC-1 reference point.
The value of each of these APNs:
\- may be the same or may differ;
\- may be the same as other non-MC services that have compatible QoS and PDN
(see NOTE); and
\- shall be made available to the UE either via UE (pre)configuration or via
initial UE configuration (see subclause 10.1.1) on a per HPLMN and optionally
also a per VPLMN basis.
NOTE: The APN value of \"IMS\" is a well-known APN, whose PDN connection
characteristics are defined in GSMA PRD IR.92 [23] and GSMA PRD IR.88 [24],
and which is used in some deployments for operator IMS‑based services e.g.
Voice over LTE. This well-known APN can be used for the MC service APN if the
SIP core belongs to the PLMN operator and both the PLMN operator and MC
service provider have agreed which QoS aspects to utilise i.e. either the QoS
aspects defined in subclause 5.2.7.2 or the QoS aspects defined in GSMA PRD
IR.92 [23] and GSMA PRD IR.88 [24].
The MC service UE may utilise PDN access credentials as specified in 3GPP TS
23.401 [17] (e.g. PAP, CHAP) to access the PDNs identified by the MC service
APN, the MC common core services APN and the MC identity management service
APN. If PDN access credentials are required, then they shall be made available
to the MC service UE via initial MC service UE configuration (see subclause
10.1.1) on a per APN basis.
The PDN connection to the APNs defined within the present subclause can be of
type \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\" (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]). If a PDN
connection to an APN defined within the present subclause is of type
\"IPv4v6\" then the MC service client shall use configuration data to
determine whether to use IPv4 or IPv6.
#### 5.2.7.1 MBMS bearer management
When operating in systems that support MBMS functionality, the MC service can
provide downlink MBMS delivery of MC service media.
When operating in systems that support MBMS functionality, the MC service can
provide downlink MBMS delivery of application level control messages targeted
towards multiple MC clients at the same time (e.g. floor idle and floor taken
for MCPTT services).
MC service UEs can receive the traffic delivered via MBMS, regardless of
whether or not they have any unicast radio bearers available.
When switching between different downlink bearers, the MC service UE shall
preserve the reception context in order to eliminate or reduce to a minimum
any interruption of service.
The MC service shall enable an MC service UE in an ongoing MC service group
session that has just entered an area of media delivery via MBMS bearers to
immediately start receiving the media for that MC service group session via
MBMS.
The MC service server shall not map MC service group sessions to MBMS bearers
that cannot provide the QoS required by the group.
An MC service UE that uses MBSFN transmission should be able to support eight
MBSFN areas simultaneously on the same RF carrier.
#### 5.2.7.2 EPS bearer considerations
5.2.7.2.1 Considerations for the EPS bearer to the MC services PDN
If the PDN connection established during the initial attach by the MC service
UE is to an APN other than the MC services APN, then prior to user
authentication, the MC service UE shall establish another PDN connection to
the MC services APN. PDN connection establishment can also be caused by a SIP
registration request for one or more MC services.
The MC gateway UE establishes a PDN connection to the MC service APN and
utilizes this connection for MC service clients host on non-3GPP devices
behind it.
The QCI value of 69 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]) shall be used for the
EPS bearer that transports SIP-1 reference point messaging.
5.2.7.2.2 Considerations for the EPS bearer to the MC common core services PDN
and MC identity management service PDN
The QCI value 8 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]) or better shall be used
for the EPS bearer that transports HTTP-1 reference point messaging. If QCI
value 8 is not used for HTTP-1 transport, then caution should be used that a
higher priority bearer (that is used for signalling or media) is not
compromised by combining HTTP-1 traffic on this bearer.
### 5.2.8 External applications access to services in a MC system
The MC system shall allow external applications to gain secure access to MC
services by supporting authentication and authorization of external
applications.
Editor\'s note: External applications reside outside a MC system and can
access a MC system using IP connectivity.
Editor\'s note: How to enable the external application access to services in
an MC system is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The definition for services and capabilities discovery is FFS.
### 5.2.9 Migration
#### 5.2.9.1 General
Migration provides means for the MC service user to obtain MC services from a
partner MC system. As the MC service client receives one or multiple user
profiles for the MC service user from its primary MC system (as described in
clause 10.1.4.3). Each user profile contains a list of partner MC systems that
the user is permitted to migrate to, along with necessary access information
to facilitate service authentication, hence, facilitate migration to the
partner MC system.
MC service interconnection needs to be provided between MC systems that wish
to provide migration of their MC service users.
Migration of MC service users between any two MC systems can be on a bilateral
or unilateral basis.
NOTE: Whether migration is bilateral or unilateral between any two MC systems
is left to business agreements between the two MC service providers, and is
outside the scope of the present document.
Migration may be triggered by the primary MC system or may be requested by the
MC service client due to its geographical changes.
Upon a successful service authorization for migration, i.e., once the MC
service user is authorized to migrate to a partner MC system, its primary MC
system marks the user as migrated, is informed of the target partner MC
system, and records the corresponding MC service ID of the migrated user
provided by the partner MC system. Further details are described in clause
10.6.3.
The functional alias of a migrated MC service user at a partner MC system,
which is defined in the partner MC system, can be utilized as a target address
in private communication as described in clause 10.16.3.
During migration of an MC service user to a partner MC system, media of the MC
service user\'s calls may need to be routed to the MC service user\'s primary
MC system e.g. for logging purposes.
#### 5.2.9.2 PLMN utilisation
Migrated MC service users should utilize the PLMN used by the partner MC
system to access MC services in the partner MC system, however, utilizing the
PLMN used by the primary MC system is not precluded.
NOTE 1: The above recommendation ensures the security policy of the partner MC
system is not compromised, the expected QCIs are used on the RAN, and ensures
service‑level delay requirements are consistently met (which are especially at
risk when the HPLMN of the primary MC system and HPLMN of the partner MC
system are far apart from a geographical point of view).
NOTE 2: Whether the PLMN used by the partner MC systems or the PLMN used by
the primary MC system is used to access MC services in partner MC systems is
left to business agreements between MC service providers and is outside the
scope of the present document.
MC service users enabled for migration shall be provisioned with configuration
that specifies which PLMNs may be used to migrate to other MC systems.
If the PLMN used by a partner MC system is different from the PLMN used by the
primary MC system (i.e. migrating MC service user starts using the PLMN used
by the partner MC system), then:
\- EPC‑level roaming (see subclause 5.2.2) is needed between the PLMN used by
the primary MC system and PLMN used by the partner MC system; and
\- the PLMN used by the partner MC system needs to enable local break-out for
the APNs specified in subclause 5.2.7 that identify the PDNs of the partner MC
system; and
\- the EPS subscriptions of the PLMN used by the primary MC system utilized by
the MC service users who are allowed to migrate to the partner MC system need
to be provisioned with, and local break-out enabled for, the APNs specified in
subclause 5.2.7 that identify the PDNs of the partner MC system.
If the PLMN used by the partner MC system and the PLMN used by the primary MC
system are the same (i.e. migrating MC service user continues to use the PLMN
used by the primary MC system), then:
\- the EPS subscriptions of the PLMN used by the primary MC system utilized by
the MC service users who are allowed to migrate to the partner MC system need
to be provisioned with the APNs specified in subclause 5.2.7 that identify the
PDNs of the partner MC system.
NOTE 3: Provisioning of APNs in all of the above includes provisioning of any
needed access credentials e.g. PAP, CHAP.
#### 5.2.9.3 SIP core / IMS utilisation
Migrated MC service users should utilise the SIP core / IMS of the partner MC
system.
NOTE 1: The above recommendation ensures the security policy of the partner MC
system is not compromised and ensures service‑level delay requirements are
consistently met (which are especially at risk when the SIP core / IMS of the
primary MC system and the SIP core / IMS of the partner MC system are far
apart from a geographical point of view).
Where connectivity and security policies allow, the same SIP core / IMS can be
utilised to connect to the primary MC system and one or more partner MC
systems.
NOTE 2: Whether the same SIP core / IMS can be utilised to connect to the
primary MC system and a partner MC system is left to business agreements
between MC service providers, and is outside the scope of the present
document.
For each partner MC system, MC service UEs of MC service users enabled for
migration shall be provisioned with:
\- configuration that controls whether the MC service UE shall connect to the
SIP core / IMS of the primary MC system or a different SIP core / IMS (i.e.
SIP core / IMS of the partner MC system); and
\- where a different SIP core / IMS to the primary MC system\'s SIP core / IMS
is to be connected to then the MC service UE shall also be configured with:
\- configuration required for the MC service UE to access the SIP core / IMS;
and
\- credentials required for the MC service UE to register with the SIP core /
IMS.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how the MC service UE connects to the SIP core / IMS
of the partner MC system to access MC services in the partner MC system.
### 5.2.10 Interconnection
#### 5.2.10.1 General
MC service interconnection allows a first set of MC service users who are
receiving MC service from a first MC system to take part in communications
with a second set of MC service users, where this second set of MC service
users are receiving MC service from a second MC system, and where the second
MC system is in a different trust domain to the first MC system.
NOTE: Assumptions for trust domains are described in subclause 5.1.2 of the
present document.
#### 5.2.10.2 Connectivity
The MC service clients of the MC service users receiving MC service(s) from a
first MC system and using MC service interconnection to take part in
communication with MC service users in a second MC system require connectivity
to only the identity management server in the second MC system.
IP connectivity is required between MC systems wishing to interconnect. The IP
connectivity is used to carry the signalling and application plane protocols
needed to provide MC service.
NOTE 1: The IP connectivity between interconnecting MC systems needs to
provide appropriate performance (e.g. low packet latency) in order to meet MC
service user performance requirements for the MC service.
NOTE 2: If IP connectivity between interconnecting MC systems is carried
outside the trust domain of both MC systems, then there will need to be
appropriate security measures applied. Such security measures are outside the
scope of the present document.
#### 5.2.10.3 Migration
Interconnection may be used by a migrated MC service user who is receiving
service from a partner MC system to take part in communication with MC service
users in the primary MC system of that migrated MC service user.
#### 5.2.10.4 Private calls
Where private calls take place using interconnection between MC service users
who are receiving MC service in different MC systems, the MC system providing
MC service to the calling MC service user will provide the controlling
function for the private call.
#### 5.2.10.5 Group calls
Where MC service users in a partner MC system of the group home MC system of
an MC service group take part in group calls in that group, the group home MC
system of the MC service group will provide the controlling function for the
group call.
#### 5.2.10.6 Group configuration
A partner MC system may apply local configuration to an MC service group
configuration received from the primary MC system (i.e. the group home MC
system).
#### 5.2.10.7 MC system topology hiding
If an MC system requires internal network topology hiding, then this shall be
achieved in the MC system by use of the following:
\- proxies for signalling plane functions; and
\- gateway MC service servers for application plane functions.
### 5.2.11 Use of priorities
#### 5.2.11.1 Requested priority
The MC system may allow the MC service client to request the priority of a
communication by selecting the corresponding priority level. The MC service
server can enforce the selected priority level in determining the application
priority for resource allocation during communication establishment.
The use of the requested priority may vary depending on MC service provider\'s
policy.
# 6 Involved business relationships
Based on the information in subclause 5.2.1 and subclause 5.2.2, figure 6-1
shows the business relationships that exist and that are needed to support a
single MC service user.
Figure 6-1: Business relationships for MC services
The MC service user belongs to a single mission critical organization based on
a MC service user agreement between the MC service user and the mission
critical organization. The MC service user can have MC service user agreement
and MC service arrangement directly with a single MC service provider.
The mission critical organization and the MC service provider can be part of
the same organization, in which case the business relationship between the two
is internal to a single organization. The mission critical organization can
have MC service arrangements with several MC service providers. In this case,
a MC service user of a mission critical organization is always served by only
one MC service provider. The MC service provider can have MC service
arrangements with several mission critical organizations. The MC service
provider can have MC service user agreements and MC service arrangements with
several MC service users.
The MC service provider and the home PLMN operator can be part of the same
organization, in which case the business relationship between the two is
internal to a single organization.
The home PLMN operator can have PLMN operator service arrangements with
multiple MC service providers and the MC service provider can have PLMN
operator service arrangements with multiple home PLMN operators. As part of
the PLMN operator service arrangement between the MC service provider and the
home PLMN operator, PLMN subscription arrangements can be provided which
allows the MC service UEs to register with home PLMN operator network.
The home PLMN operator can have PLMN roaming agreements with multiple visited
PLMN operators and the visited PLMN operator can have PLMN roaming agreements
with multiple home PLMN operators.
Where mutual aid operates between MC service providers, figure 6-2 shows the
required additional relationship. An MC service user can only affiliate to
groups of the partner MC service provider:
\- if such a service provider agreement exists; or
\- subject to authorisation for a specific group membership from the partner
MC service provider.
Figure 6-2: Additional business relationships for mutual aid
The primary and partner MC service providers do not need to be served by the
same home SIP core operator in order to support mutual communication and
mutual aid when interconnection between the SIP cores is available.
An example of the usage of these business relationships is elaborated for two
users, one resident on its primary MC service provider and one providing
mutual aid within the same group:
User A is a user on MC service provider X in group M. The relationships are as
follows:
a) user A has user configuration established with MC service provider X and
forms part of group M;
b) user A uses a PLMN subscription arrangement with PLMN operator R provided
by MC service provider X; and
c) MC service provider X has a PLMN operator service arrangement with PLMN
operator R.
User B is a user on MC service provider Y and joins group M as part of a
mutual aid:
a) user B has user configuration established with MC service provider Y and
forms part of its own set of groups relating to MC service provider Y;
b) user B uses a PLMN subscription arrangement with PLMN operator S provided
by MC service provider Y;
c) MC service provider Y has a PLMN operator service arrangement with PLMN
operator S;
d) MC service provider Y has a service provider agreement with MC service
provider X that allows user B to participate within group M; and
e) PLMN operator S has a PLMN roaming agreement with PLMN operator R allowing
user B to roam to PLMN operator R.
NOTE: There is no requirement that the PLMN operator that user B roams to is
the same PLMN operator that MC service provider X has a service arrangement
with. It does however need to support one or more MC services capabilities,
and provides service in the same geographic area as used by MC service
provider X.
# 7 Functional model
## 7.1 General
The functional model for the MC services architecture is defined as a series
of planes to allow for the breakdown of the architectural description.
Further, each plane is expected to operate in an independent manner, providing
services to the connected planes as and when requested by the connected plane,
and requesting services from other planes as required.
As a consequence of this each plane should manage on its own behalf:
a) use of identities. Each plane is therefore responsible for the privacy of
that plane\'s own identities; and
b) security for that plane. This does not preclude a plane requesting security
services from another plane, but that is a decision made within the plane, as
to whether to use offered security services or mechanisms within the plane
itself.
NOTE: Terminology such as client and server are not meant to imply specific
physical implementation of a functional entity.
## 7.2 Description of the planes
The following planes are identified:
a) application plane: The application plane provides all of the services (e.g.
call control, floor control, video control, data control) required by the user
together with the necessary functions to support MC service. It uses the
services of the signalling control plane to support those requirements. For
example, within the MCPTT service, the application plane also provides for the
conferencing of media, and provision of tones and announcements; and
b) signalling control plane: The signalling control plane provides the
necessary signalling support to establish the association of users involved in
an MC service, such as an MCPTT call or other type of MC services. The
signalling control plane also offers access to and control of services across
MC services. The signalling control plane uses the services of the bearer
plane.
Bearers supporting these planes are defined for LTE within 3GPP TS 23.401
[17]. The resource control that is needed to support these planes is defined
within 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]. The application plane also relies on the use of
multicast bearers established via procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23. 468 [18]
and 3GPP TS 23.246 [11].
## 7.3 Functional model description
### 7.3.1 On-network functional model
Each MC service can be represented by an application plane functional model.
The functional model across MC services may be similar but is described by the
individual functional entities and reference points that belong to that MC
service. Within the application plane for an MC service there is a common set
of functions and reference points. The common set is shared across services.
This common set of functions and reference points is known as the common
services core.
Figure 7.3.1-1 shows the functional model for the application plane for an MC
system.
Figure 7.3.1-1: Functional model for application plane for an MC system
The common services core functions and reference points shown in figure
7.3.1-1 are shared across each MC service. The description of the functions
and reference points specific to an MC service is contained in the
corresponding MC service TS.
In the model shown in figure 7.3.1-1, the following apply:
\- A specific MC service server is an instantiation of a GCS AS in accordance
with 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
\- The functional alias management client is an integrated functional entity
of the configuration management client. The functional alias management client
is described in subclause 7.4.2.2.12.
\- The functional alias management server is an integrated functional entity
of the configuration management server. The functional alias management server
is described in subclause 7.4.2.2.13.
Figure 7.3.1-2 shows the functional model for the signalling control plane.
Figure 7.3.1-2: Functional model for signalling control plane
Figure 7.3.1-3 shows the relationships between the reference points of the
application plane of an MC service server and the signalling plane.
Figure 7.3.1-3: Relationships between reference points of MC service
application plane and signalling control planes
NOTE 1: Application plane reference point CSC-7 makes use of SIP-2 reference
point when the group management servers are connected by a single SIP core.
Where they are joined by more than one SIP core, CSC-7 also makes use of the
SIP-3 reference point.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, the HTTP proxy, which provides the interconnection
between HTTP-1, HTTP-2 and HTTP-3 reference points, is not shown in figure
7.3.1-3.
NOTE 3: CSC-5, CSC-9, and CSC-15 make use of SIP-1 and SIP-2 reference points.
For simplicity, this mapping relationship is not shown in figure 7.3.1-3.
### 7.3.2 Off-network functional model
Figure 7.3.2-1 shows the functional model for off-network operation.
Figure 7.3.2-1: Functional model for MC service off-network operation
For a specific MC service, the description of off-network operation is
contained in the corresponding MC service TS.
## 7.4 Functional entities description

one or more MC service applications with non-group management MC service
related information and configure data on the configuration management client.
The configuration management server manages MC service configuration supported
within the MC service provider.
The configuration management server functional entity is supported by the SIP
AS and HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
The configuration management server provides the functional alias management
server functionality as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.13.
##### 7.4.2.2.3 Group management client
The group management client functional entity acts as the application user
agent for management of groups. A MC system maintains groups corresponding to
one or more mission critical organizations. The group management client
interacts with the group management server.
The group management client functional entity is supported by the signalling
user agent and HTTP client functional entities of the signalling control
plane.
##### 7.4.2.2.4 Group management server (GMS)
The group management server functional entity provides for management of
groups supported within the MC service provider.
The group management server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS and
HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
All the group management clients supporting users belonging to a single group
are required to use the same group management server for that group. A group
management client supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have
relationships with multiple group management servers.
The group management server manages media policy information for use by the UE
for media processing.
The group management server manages group call policy information for use by
the UE for both on-network and off-network group call control.
##### 7.4.2.2.5 Identity management client
This functional entity acts as the application user agent for MC ID
transactions. It interacts with the identity management server.
##### 7.4.2.2.6 Identity management server (IdMS)
The identity management server is a functional entity that is capable of
authenticating the MC ID. It contains the knowledge and means to do
authentication by verifying the credentials supplied by the user.
The identity management server functional entity may reside in the same domain
as the user\'s MC system.
##### 7.4.2.2.7 Key management client
This functional entity acts as the application user agent for key management
functions. It interacts with the key management server.

user location information, and provides user location information to the MC
service server. The location management server may also acquire location
information provided by PLMN operator (e.g. LCS network)_._
NOTE: The reference point and procedures to acquire location information from
the PLMN operator are out of scope of the present document.
##### 7.4.2.2.11 Migration management server
The migration management server is used in migration from the SIP core of the
primary MC system to the SIP core of the partner MC system. In the SIP core of
the primary MC system, the migration management server provides configured SIP
identities to be used by a particular MC service UE in order to migrate to one
or more SIP cores belonging to partner MC systems. In the SIP core of a
partner MC system, the migration management server provides a point of
authority for binding SIP identities of the SIP core of partner MC system and
SIP identities of the SIP core for primary MC system.
The migration management server is used during configuration of an MC service
UE for MC service user migration (see subclause 10.1.6.1), and during SIP
registration of an MC service UE\'s SIP user agent when migrating to the SIP
core of a partner MC system (see subclause 10.6.2).
A single set or multiple sets of SIP identities of the SIP core of the primary
MC system for an MC service UE that is enabled for migration shall be
configured in the primary MC system\'s migration management server.
NOTE 1: Different sets of SIP identities of the SIP core of the primary MC
system provided to different partner MC system migration management servers
enable migration of a single MC service UE on a per partner MC system basis.
EXAMPLE: An MC service UE has SIP identities 1 of the SIP core of primary MC
system for migrating to the SIP core of partner MC system 1, and has SIP
identities 2 of the SIP core of the primary MC system for migrating to the SIP
core of partner MC system 2. MC service UE\'s primary MC system decides to
withdraw migration to partner MC system 1 by disabling primary SIP identities
1 of the SIP core of primary MC system, however, since primary MC system SIP
identities 2 are still enabled, the MC service UE can still migrate to the SIP
core of partner MC system 2.
A unique set of partner MC system SIP identities for all possible inbound
migrated MC service UEs shall be configured in the partner MC system\'s
migration management server.
NOTE 2: The migration management server could be part of the SIP database.
NOTE 3: When the SIP core is located in the PLMN operator domain the migration
management server will also be located in the PLMN operator domain. When the
SIP core is in the MC service provider domain the migration management server
will be located in the MC service provider domain.
The migration management server functional entity is supported by the Diameter
proxy functional entity of the signalling control plane.
##### 7.4.2.2.12 Functional alias management client
The functional alias management client functional entity acts as the
application user agent for management of functional aliases. The functional
alias management client interacts with the functional alias management server.

SIP AS and by the HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control
plane.
#### 7.4.2.3 MC service
##### 7.4.2.3.1 MC service client
The MC service client functional entity acts as the user agent for all MC
service transactions. For a specific MC service, the detailed description of
functions of the MC service client is contained in the corresponding MC
service TS.
##### 7.4.2.3.2 MC service server
The MC service server functional entity provides centralised support for MC
services.
The MC service server functional entity represents a specific instantiation of
the GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18] to control multicast and unicast
operations for group communications. For a specific MC service, the detailed
description of the GCS AS role assumed by the MC service server is contained
in the corresponding MC service TS.
The MC service server performs the functional alias controlling role for
functional alias management including functional alias activation,
deactivation, take over and interrogation. For a single functional alias, only
one MC service server is specified as the functional alias controlling role.
The detailed description of the functional alias controlling role assumed by
the different MC service servers are contained in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS
23.281 [12] and 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
The MC service server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS, HTTP
client and HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
##### 7.4.2.3.3 MC service user database
This functional entity contains information of the MC service user profile
associated with an MC service ID that is held by the MC service provider at
the application plane. The MC service user profile is determined by the
mission critical organization, the MC service provider, and potentially the MC
service user.
Each MC service shall have a corresponding MC service user database i.e. MCPTT
user database as defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], MCVideo user database as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] and MCData user database as defined in 3GPP TS
23.282 [13]. These MC service user databases can be co-located.
##### 7.4.2.3.4 MC gateway server
The MC gateway server provides support for interconnection between a primary
MC system and a partner MC system in a different trust domain whilst providing
topology hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MC service servers in the
partner MC system without needing to expose the MC service servers in the
primary MC system outside the trusted domain of the primary MC system. It may
be a role of an MC service server described in subclause 7.4.2.3.2 of the
present document.
The MC gateway server is responsible for relaying signalling control messages
and media between MC service servers in the interconnected MC systems.
### 7.4.3 Signalling control plane
#### 7.4.3.1 SIP entities
##### 7.4.3.1.1 Signalling user agent
This functional entity acts as the SIP user agent (both client and server) for
all SIP transactions.
##### 7.4.3.1.2 SIP AS
The SIP AS functional entity supports the following functions on behalf of the
MC service:
\- influencing and impacting the SIP session; and
\- supporting event subscription and event notification.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the Application Server as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [6].
##### 7.4.3.1.3 SIP core
###### 7.4.3.1.3.1 General
The SIP core contains a number of sub-entities responsible for registration,
service selection and routing in the signalling control plane.
The SIP core shall be either:
1\. compliant with 3GPP TS 23.228 [9], i.e. the SIP core is a 3GPP IP
multimedia core network subsystem; or
2\. a SIP core, which internally need not comply with the architecture of 3GPP
TS 23.228 [9], but with the reference points that are defined in subclause
7.5.3 (if exposed), compliant to the reference points defined in 3GPP TS
23.002 [6].
The data related to the functions of the SIP core, e.g. for data for
application service selection, the identity of the serving registrar or
authentication related information may be provided by the PLMN operator
responsible for the bearer plane. In this case, the SIP database that is the
source of the data may be part of the HSS. Alternatively, this data may be
provided by the MC service provider. In this case, the source of the data may
be the MC service provider\'s SIP database.
###### 7.4.3.1.3.2 Local inbound / outbound proxy
The local inbound / outbound proxy functional entity acts as both an inbound
proxy and an outbound proxy for all SIP transactions. This functional entity
can provide the following functions:
\- NAT traversal;
\- Resource control;
\- Route/forward requests and responses to the user agents;
\- SIP signalling security; and
\- Depending on the PLMN operator policy, discovery and address resolution,
including E.164 numbers.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this functional entity is provided by the P-CSCF
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
###### 7.4.3.1.3.3 Registrar finder
The registrar finder functional entity is responsible for:
a) Identifying the serving registrar / application service selection
functional entity. The serving registrar / application service selection
functional entity is identified using information provided either by the PLMN
operator\'s own SIP database or the MC service provider\'s SIP database, and
optionally using the PLMN operator\'s internal information e.g. network
topology, registrar availability.
1) Registrar finder and registrar in the MC service provider domain: registrar
finder in the MC service provider\'s domain uses the information from the MC
service provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving registrar in the MC
service provider domain.
2) Registrar finder and registrar in the PLMN operator domain: registrar
finder uses information from PLMN operator\'s SIP database to identify the
serving registrar in the PLMN operator domain.
3) Registrar finder in PLMN operator domain and registrar in MC service
provider domain: registrar finder uses information from the MC service
provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving registrar in the MC service
provider domain.
NOTE 1: The need for the registrar finder is deployment specific e.g. a
deployment that has only one registrar does not need the registrar finder and
the related SIP database information.
b) Providing discovery and address resolution, including E.164 numbers.
NOTE 2: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the I-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
###### 7.4.3.1.3.4 Registrar / application service selection
The registrar / application service selection functional entity provides the
following functions:
\- Registrar function (with integral provision of a location server) and also
acts as an inbound proxy (with access to the integral location server), and
outbound proxy for all SIP transactions where application service selection is
required. It registers the user and maintains the association of the location
and identity of the user in a location service. It provides notifications of
the registration states.
\- Supports authentication for identities provided within SIP signalling. Both
the registrar (with integral location server) and authentication functions are
supported by access either to the public network\'s own SIP database or the MC
service provider\'s SIP database.
\- Can provide the application service selection for all SIP transactions,
possibly based on application service selection information stored by either
the public network\'s own SIP database or the MC service provider\'s SIP
database.
\- Performs SIP signalling security.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the S-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
##### 7.4.3.1.4 Diameter proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy agent for Diameter messaging as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [26].
The Diameter proxy, when used on the AAA-2 interface, is collocated with the
migration management server.
Other instances of the Diameter proxy may also be present in the SIP core /
IMS.
NOTE: The number of instances of the Diameter proxy is deployment specific.
#### 7.4.3.2 SIP database
##### 7.4.3.2.1 General
The SIP database contains information concerning the SIP subscriptions and
corresponding identity and authentication information required by the SIP
core, and such information as application service selection.
In deployment scenarios where the PLMN operator provides the SIP core, this
database is provided by the HSS.
In deployment scenarios where the MC service provider provides the SIP core,
the SIP database may be provided by the MC service provider.
Access to the data residing in the SIP database is restricted to the SIP core
entities that are specifically serving the subscriber/user whose data are
stored, i.e. registrars and registrar finders can access SIP databases only
when they are part of the same trust domain for the data being provided.
NOTE: The SIP database can be in a different network than the registrar finder
since the trust domain for the criteria for registrar selection can be
different than the trust domain for the signalling plane user identities.
The SIP database is responsible for storing the following user related
information:
\- signalling plane user identities: Numbering and addressing information;
\- signalling plane security information: SIP core access control information
for authentication and authorization;
\- MC service UE Location information at inter-system level: the SIP database
supports the user registration, and stores inter-system location information,
etc.; and
\- signalling plane subscription profile (including initial filter criteria).
The SIP database also generates signalling plane security information for
mutual authentication, communication integrity check and ciphering.
Based on this information, the SIP database is also responsible to support the
call control and session management entities of the SIP core.
The SIP database consists of the following functionalities:
\- support for control functions of the SIP core such as the Registrar and
Registrar finder. This is needed to enable subscriber usage of the SIP core
services. This functionality is independent of the access network used to
access the SIP core; and
\- authentication functionality required by the SIP core to authenticate the
MC service UE.
##### 7.4.3.2.2 SIP database logical functions
The SIP database provides the following logical functions:
a) mobility management;
\- provides the UE mobility through the SIP core.
b) registrar assignment support;
\- provides to the registrar finder the required capabilities for MC services
based on MC service provider requirements on a per-user basis, (e.g. whether a
particular registrar within the PLMN operator\'s network (e.g. a registrar
reserved for MC service use or a registrar in a secure location) or a
registrar within the MC service provider network is assigned.
c) call and/or session establishment support;
\- provides the call and/or session establishment procedures in the SIP core.
For terminating traffic, it provides information on which registrar currently
hosts the user.
d) user security information generation;
\- provides generation of user authentication, integrity and ciphering data
for the SIP core.
e) signalling plane security support;
\- provides authentication procedures to access MC services by storing the
generated data for authentication, integrity and ciphering at the signalling
plane and by providing these data to the appropriate registrar.
f) user identification handling;
\- provides the appropriate relations among all the identifiers uniquely
determining the signalling plane identities in the SIP core e.g. IMS public
identities.
g) access authorisation; and
\- provides authorisation of the user for mobile access when requested by the
registrar e.g. by checking that the user is allowed to roam to that visited
network.
h) service authorisation support.
\- provides basic authorisation for terminating call/session establishment and
service invocation. The SIP database may update the registrar with filter
criteria to trigger the MC service server(s).
#### 7.4.3.3 HTTP entities
##### 7.4.3.3.1 HTTP client
This functional entity acts as the client for all hypertext transactions.
##### 7.4.3.3.2 HTTP proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy for hypertext transactions between the
HTTP client and one or more HTTP servers. The HTTP proxy terminates a TLS
session on HTTP-1 with the HTTP client of the MC service UE allowing the HTTP
client to establish a single TLS session for hypertext transactions with
multiple HTTP servers that are reachable by the HTTP proxy.
The HTTP proxy terminates the HTTP-3 reference point that lies between
different HTTP proxies. It may provide a topology hiding function from HTTP
entities outside the trust domain of the MC system.
The HTTP proxy is not used as part of CSC-1 interface. CSC-1 is a direct HTTP
interface between the IdM client in the UE and the IdM server as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
According to 3GPP TS 33.180 [25], either an HTTP proxy or a direct HTTP
interface is used between the key management server and the key management
client in the UE for CSC-8.
The HTTP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the HTTP clients and HTTP
servers that are located within a MC service provider\'s network. There can be
multiple instances of an HTTP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.
NOTE: The number of instances of the HTTP proxy is deployment specific.
##### 7.4.3.3.3 HTTP server
This functional entity acts as the HTTP server for all hypertext transactions.

# 8 Identities
## 8.1 Application plane
### 8.1.1 Mission Critical user identity (MC ID)
The mission critical user identity is also known as the MC ID. The MC ID is
the identity that an MC service user presents to the identity management
server during a user authentication transaction. In general, since identity
management is a common service it uses an identity which is linked to a set of
credentials (e.g. biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not
necessarily be tied to a single mission critical service. The MC ID and the MC
service ID may be the same. The MC ID uniquely identifies the MC service user
to the identity management server. The MC ID is used by the identity
management server to provide the identity management client a means for
mission critical service authentication.
NOTE: The specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to
use the MC user identity is specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
### 8.1.2 MC service user identity (MC service ID)
The MC service user identity is also known as the MC service ID. The MC
service ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that
represents the MC service user. The MC service ID identifies an MC service
user. The MC service ID may also identify one or more MC service user profiles
for the user at the application layer.
There are attributes associated with the MC service ID configured in the MC
service that relate to the human user of the MC service. Typically, this
information identifies the MC service user, by name or role, may also identify
a user\'s organization or agency, and may also identify MC service user\'s
service subscription to one or more MC services. Such attributes associated
with an MC service ID can be used by the MC service server to make
authorization decisions about the MC service granted to the user. For example,
if the MC service user is subscribed to MCPTT service, an attribute that
identifies a user\'s role as an incident commander could automatically be used
by the MCPTT service to grant the user additional administrative rights over
the creation of groups, or access to privileged talk groups.
The MC service ID shall be a URI. The MC service ID uniquely identifies an MC
service user in an MC system. The MC service ID indicates the MC system where
the MC service ID is defined.
When required by the MC service provider, the MC service ID is hidden from the
signalling control plane.
A default or temporary MC service ID may be used where a user is not yet
associated with a device. When a user would like to use one or more MC
services but has not been authenticated by the identity management server, a
default or temporary MC service ID and a corresponding MC service user profile
may be used.
For the purposes of this document, an MC service administrator, MC service
dispatcher, or MC service authorized user is an MC service user that has been
granted special privileges within the context of the client function being
performed (e.g. MC service client, group management client, configuration
management client, key management client). For example, the MC service ID of a
group management client of an MC service administrator can be authorized
within the group management server to create new groups and add members to
groups (i.e. administrative function), but is not authorized to dynamically
create group or user regroups (i.e. operational function). Alternatively, for
example, the MC service ID of a dispatcher will typically be authorized to
dynamically create group and user regroups, but is not authorized to create
new groups or add/delete members to groups. The MC service authorization
framework is defined in TS 33.180 [25].
### 8.1.3 MC service group identity (MC service group ID)
#### 8.1.3.1 General
The MC service group identity is also known as the MC service group ID. The MC
service group ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that
represents a set of MC service users. The set of MC service users may belong
to the same or different MC systems. The MC system for each user (within the
group) is identified by each user\'s respective MC service ID.
The MC service group ID identifies an MC service group in an MC system. It
indicates the MC system where the MC service group is defined. It indicates
the MC service server within the MC system where the group is defined as
described in subclause 8.3.2.
The MC service group ID is used as follows:
a) For identifying a set of identities of its group members; and
b) By the MC service client to address the MC service group.
The MC service group ID shall be a URI.
When required by the MC service provider, the MC service group ID is hidden
from the signalling control plane.
In 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], the MCPTT group ID is an MC service group ID.
In 3GPP TS 23.281 [12], the MCVideo group ID is an MC service group ID.
In 3GPP TS 23.282 [13], the MCData group ID is an MC service group ID.
#### 8.1.3.2 MC service group ID management (off-network operation)
In off-network operation, an MC service group ID is used for identifying the
MC service group while off-network. The MC service group ID should be resolved
to the ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for the
group communication. The MC service UE is able to make one or more MC service
communications (as per the group configuration) with other member UEs whose
users are of the same MC service group ID over ProSe direct communications
based on ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and ProSe Group IP multicast address, and
utilising IPv4 or IPv6 as indicated by policy, as described in 3GPP TS 23.303
[14].
Figure 8.1.3.2-1 illustrates how the MC service group ID, ProSe Group IP
multicast address and the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are mapped to each other.
ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured
in accordance with the MC service group ID. Thus, they are pre-defined and
associated. This mapping information should be provisioned through UICC in the
UE or through ProSe function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14], or be
delivered from an application server. Mapping information is provisioned from
group management server for online configuration, and provisioned from
configuration management server for offline configuration.
NOTE: To define the retrieval mechanism of the off-network information (ProSe
Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID) from ProSe function to
group management server is out of scope of the present document.
Figure 8.1.3.2-1: MC service group ID management in off-network operation
### 8.1.4 MC system identity (MC system ID)
The MC system ID is a globally unique identifier representing an MC system.
The MC system ID shall be a URI.
### 8.1.5 Functional Alias
Functional alias provides a complementary, role-based user identification
scheme which can be used by MC service users for operational purposes in the
form of meaningful elements such as the function, the order number or vehicle
identifications that can be used within any form of MC service communication.
Functional alias takes a form of a URI where the host part of the URI shall
identify the home MC system MC service functional alias controlling server.
The application addressing remains in its form and forms the foundation for
the association with the corresponding functional alias. An MC service user
can simultaneously activate several functional aliases but only one can be
associated to a certain communication.
Each functional alias is subject to the uniqueness principle within an
organization and can be shared simultaneously by several MC service users,
depending on the assignment. In this case, all assigned MC service users
sharing a functional alias can be included in a communication.
An MC service user uses a different set of functional aliases when migrating
towards another service organization to allow the MC service user to be
reachable by functional aliases within that organization.
The use of a functional alias always requires an association with the MC
service ID. The MC service ID needs to be used to provide the security context
for a communication.
### 8.1.6 MC service UE label
The optional MC service UE label allows to distinguish between different MC
service UEs in use by the same MC service ID. The MC service UE label may be
added to location information reports.
The non-routable MC service UE label may include human readable information,
such as an incident or MC service user specific ID, manufacturer name, brand,
model, serial number, etc.
NOTE: The MC service UE label may be provided during initial MC service UE
configuration, see clause A.6.
### 8.1.7 GW MC service ID
The GW MC service ID is used for connection authorisation of non-3GPP devices
via an MC gateway UE with an MC system. The GW MC service ID indicates the MC
service.
The MC service ID used for MC service authorisation and the GW MC service ID
used for connection authorization may have different values. Both identities
are configured by the Mission Critical Organisation.
## 8.2 SIP signalling control plane
The SIP signalling control plane depends upon the use of both a private user
identity and one or more public user identities.
When the signalling user agent sends registration requests to the registrar /
application service selection, the private user identity is used to find
corresponding credentials for authentication of the signalling user agent by
the registrar / application service selection. This private user identity
fulfils the same functions as the IMPI defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
All SIP signalling messages sent by a signalling user agent to an MC service
server via a SIP core use a public user identity as the identifier to enable
signalling messages to be routed through the SIP system. The public user
identity fulfils the same functions as IMPU defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
NOTE 1: The relationship between the private user identity and public user
identity is defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
The public user identities do not necessarily contain any application-level
attributes of MC services (e.g., MCPTT ID). Any association of the public user
identities with such attributes occurs at the application layer only.
When the SIP core and the MC service are part of the same trust domain, public
user identities may be provided by the MC service provider or the PLMN
operator. When the SIP core and the MC service are part of the different trust
domains, public user identities may be provided by the PLMN operator.
NOTE 2: The MC service provider can have an agreement with the PLMN operator
to manage a pool of public user identities.
The SIP core may generate public GRUUs and temporary GRUUs in order to
uniquely identify MC service UEs when a user logging on from multiple devices
or multiple users sharing the same device is supported per 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
Public service identity is used as the identifier to route SIP signalling for
the MC system. The public service identity fulfils the same functions as PSI
defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
## 8.3 Relationship between identities in different planes
### 8.3.1 Relationship between MC service ID and public user identity
The following relationships exist between the MC service ID(s) and the public
user identity(ies):
\- An MC service ID may be mapped to one or more public user identities (e.g.
multiple UEs, shared UE, multiple MC services);
\- A public user identity may be mapped to one or more MC service IDs (e.g.
UE-to-network relay); and
\- An MC service ID may be mapped to one or more public GRUUs (e.g. a user
logging on from multiple UEs, multiple users sharing the same UE).
The MC service server manages the mapping between MC service IDs and public
user identities.
The MC service server manages the mapping between MC service IDs and public
GRUUs.
Temporary GRUUs are mapped to public GRUUs by the SIP core.
The public user identity does not necessarily identify the MC service user at
the SIP signalling control plane. When the MC service provider and the home
PLMN operator are part of the same trust domain, the public user identity in
the SIP signalling control plane may also identify the MC service user at the
application plane.
### 8.3.2 Relationship between MC service group ID and public service identity
Each MC service group ID shall be mapped to a public service identity for the
MC service server where the group is defined. The MC service server manages
the mapping between MC service group IDs and public service identities.
When the MC service provider and the home PLMN operator are part of the same
trust domain, the public service identity in the SIP signalling control plane
may also identify the MC service group ID at the application plane.

servers
# 9 Application of functional model to deployments
## 9.1 General
This clause describes the application of the functional model, described in
clause 7, to on-network and off-network deployments. It also describes
deployment scenarios that highlight some of the possible variations in the way
that the functional model can be applied in different situations.
## 9.2 Architecture model and deployment scenarios for on-network operations
### 9.2.1 On-network architectural model
#### 9.2.1.1 On-network architectural model diagram
Figure 9.2.1.1-1 below is the on-network architectural model for the MC system
solution, where the MC system provides one or more MC services via a single
PLMN.
Figure 9.2.1.1-1: On-network architectural model
#### 9.2.1.2 Application services layer
##### 9.2.1.2.1 Overview
The application services layer includes application functions of one or more
MC services and any required supporting functions grouped into common services
core.
##### 9.2.1.2.2 Common services core
Common services core is composed of the following functional entities:
\- for common services, a configuration management server as described in
subclause 7.4.2.2.2, a group management server as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.4, an identity management server as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.6
and a key management server as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.8; and
\- for signalling control, an HTTP proxy as described in subclause 7.4.3.3.2
and an HTTP server as described in subclause 7.4.3.3.3.
##### 9.2.1.2.3 MC services
MC services are composed of the following functional entities:
\- an MC service server as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.2 with relevant
application functions of the corresponding MC service defined in the
corresponding MC service TS.
#### 9.2.1.3 SIP core
The SIP core provides rendezvous (contact address binding and URI resolution)
and service control (application service selection) functions. It is composed
of the following functional entities:
\- for signalling control, a local inbound / outbound proxy as described in
subclause 7.4.3.1.3.2, a registrar finder as described in subclause
7.4.3.1.3.3 and a registrar / application service selection entity as
described in subclause 7.4.3.1.3.4.
#### 9.2.1.4 EPS
The EPS provides point-to-point and point-to-multipoint bearer services with
QoS.
#### 9.2.1.5 UE 1
UE 1 is:
\- an MC service UE in on-network mode supporting bearer services and
application(s) related to one or more MC service;
\- an MC service UE that acts as ProSe UE-to-network relay; or
\- both of the above.
When acting as an MC service UE in on-network mode supporting bearer services
and application(s) related to one or more MC services, UE 1 is composed of the
same functional entities as for UE 2, as described in subclause 9.2.1.6,
without the support of ProSe capabilities.
#### 9.2.1.6 UE 2
UE 2 is a device using ProSe UE-to-network relay, and supporting
application(s) related to one or more MC services. It is composed of the
following functional entities:
\- for common services, a group management client as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.3, a configuration management client as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.1, an identity management client as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.5
and a key management client as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.7;
\- for MC services, MC service clients as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.1
with relevant application functions of the corresponding MC service defined in
the corresponding MC service TS; and
\- for signalling control, a signalling user agent as described in subclause
7.4.3.1.1 and an HTTP client as described in subclause 7.4.3.3.1.
### 9.2.2 Deployment scenarios
#### 9.2.2.1 Administration of MC service, SIP core and EPS
##### 9.2.2.1.1 General
This subclause describes five different deployment scenarios in which
different administration of MC service, SIP core and EPS are described,
together with the sensitivities of identities and other forms of signalling in
those scenarios.
In each of these scenarios, the owner of the devices at each plane may be
different from the organisation that administers these devices. For example,
the MC service provider may own some RAN components within the EPS even when
the EPS is administered by the PLMN operator, and the MC service UE may be
owned by an organisation that is independent from PLMN and MC service
providers.
##### 9.2.2.1.2 Common administration of all planes
In this scenario, all planes (application services layer, SIP core and EPS)
are administered by the same party. This is illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.2-1
below.
Figure 9.2.2.1.2-1: Common administration of all services by one operator
Although the identities in each plane are separate according to clause 8,
there is no particular sensitivity of identities and other information at the
application plane, and these may be exposed to the SIP core and the EPS.
All authorisation and authentication mechanisms at each plane, i.e. the
application services layer, SIP core and EPS, shall be separate, but there may
be no need for any restrictions in how these are stored and managed; for
example the same entity could provide services to each of the application
services layer, SIP core and EPS.
##### 9.2.2.1.3 MC service provider separate from SIP core and EPS
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.3-1, the MC service
provider is separate and independent from the PLMN operator, and the MC
service is administered independently of the EPS and SIP core. The PLMN
operator administers the EPS and the SIP core.
Figure 9.2.2.1.3-1: MC service provider administers MC service separately from
SIP core and EPS
The MC service provider may require that all application services layer
identities and other sensitive information are hidden both from the SIP core
and the EPS.
When required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorisation
mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer are
hidden from and not available to the PLMN operator.
##### 9.2.2.1.4 MC service provider administers SIP core, separate from EPS
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.4-1, the MC service
provider administers the SIP core, and the MC services and SIP core are
independent of the PLMN operator.
Figure 9.2.2.1.4-1: MC service provider provision of SIP core, separate domain
from EPS
The MC service provider may require that all identities and other sensitive
information at the application services layer are hidden from the EPS. The MC
service provider need not hide the identities and signalling at the
application services layer from the SIP core. However the MC service provider
may require that identities and other sensitive information between SIP core
and SIP client in the MC service UE are also hidden from the EPS.
All authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at
both application services layer and at SIP signalling plane may need to be
hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.
##### 9.2.2.1.5 SIP core partially administered by both PLMN operator and MC
service provider
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.5-1, the SIP core is
partially administered by both parties, for example when the SIP core
registrar is administered by the MC service provider, but the SIP core
registrar finder and proxy is administered by the PLMN operator.
Figure 9.2.2.1.5-1: MC service provider partial provision of SIP core,
separate domain from EPS
The MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the
application services layer are hidden from the EPS, and may require identities
and other sensitive information to be hidden from the PLMN operator
administered part of the SIP core.
All authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at
the application services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available
to, the PLMN operator.
##### 9.2.2.1.6 PLMN operator administers SIP core with SIP identities
administered by MC service provider
In this scenario, the PLMN operator administers the SIP core. However, the
identities used by the SIP core (IMPI and IMPU) for MC service UEs served by
the MC service provider are provided from the SIP database of the MC service
provider.
Figure 9.2.2.1.6-1: MC service provider provides identities to PLMN operator
SIP core
The MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the
application services layer are hidden from the SIP core and EPS.
When required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorisation
mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer may
need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.
The security roots (authentication keys) required for access to the signalling
control plane are not available to the PLMN operator as these are held in the
MC service provider\'s SIP database. However, derived parameters e.g.
authentication vectors are provided to the SIP core to allow signalling
control plane authentication to take place.
#### 9.2.2.2 MC service user database, SIP database and HSS
Figures 9.2.2.2-1 to 9.2.2.2-4 show the possible deployment scenarios of the
MC service user database and SIP database, including collocation with the HSS.
The MC service user database may be combined with an HSS in some deployment
scenarios (e.g. when the MC service provider and the PLMN operator are part of
the same trust domain).
The MC service user database may be a user data repository (UDR) in deployment
scenarios when the UDC architecture is applied (see 3GPP TS 23.335 [15]), in
that case the MC service server and the configuration management server are
assumed to be application front-ends and the Ud interface is used to access
data from the repository.
NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the SIP database can be located within
the SIP core, in which case the AAA‑1 interface is not exposed.
NOTE 2: The MC service user database and the MC service server are always
deployed in the same network i.e. both in the PLMN operator\'s network or both
in the MC service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-1: Collocation of MC service user database and SIP database
with HSS
The HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-1 can be deployed either in the PLMN
operator\'s network or the MC service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-2: Shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based
deployment of MC service - SIP database collocated with HSS with separate MC
service user database
The MC service user database depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-2 can be deployed in
the PLMN operator\'s network or the MC service provider\'s network, and the
HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-2 can be deployed in the same or different
network to the MC service user database i.e. PLMN operator\'s network or the
MC service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-3: Shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based
deployment of MC service - MC service user database and SIP database deployed
together, with separate HSS
The MC service user database and SIP database depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-3 can
be deployed in the PLMN operator\'s network or the MC service provider\'s
network, and the HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-3 can be deployed in the same
or different network to the MC service user database i.e. PLMN operator\'s
network or the MC service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-4: Shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based
deployment of MC service - separate HSS, MC service user database and SIP
database
Each of the MC service user database, SIP database and HSS depicted in figure
9.2.2.2-4 can be deployed in the same or different networks i.e. PLMN
operator\'s network or the MC service provider\'s network.
#### 9.2.2.3 Control of bearers by SIP core and MC service server
##### 9.2.2.3.1 General
This subclause describes two different scenarios in which bearers are
controlled by access to Rx by either the SIP core or the MC service server.
These may provide suitable models for each of the scenarios listed in
subclause 9.2.2.1. However, there is no direct correlation of any of the
scenarios described in this subclause to each of the scenarios described in
subclause 9.2.2.1.
##### 9.2.2.3.2 Control of bearers by SIP core
In this scenario, bearer control is performed by the SIP core alone, as shown
in figure 9.2.2.3.2-1 below.
Figure 9.2.2.3.2-1: Bearer control by SIP core
##### 9.2.2.3.3 Control of bearers by MC service server
In this scenario, bearer control is performed by the MC service server alone,
as shown in figure 9.2.2.3.3-1 below.
Figure 9.2.2.3.3-1: Bearer control by MC service server
## 9.3 Architecture model for off-network operations
### 9.3.1 Off-network architectural model diagram
Figure 9.3.1-1 shows the off-network architectural model for the MC system
solution for inter-UE communication, where no relay function is used.
Figure 9.3.1-1: Off-network architectural model for inter-UE communication
where no relay function is used
Figure 9.3.1-2 shows the off-network architectural model for the MC system
solution for configuration management and group management.
Figure 9.3.1-2: Off-network architectural model for configuration management
and group management
NOTE 1: The offline common services server denoted in figure 9.3.1-2 could be
provided by a portable device e.g. laptop.
NOTE 2: Non-EPS access can be any IP-CAN that is mutually supported by the
offline common services server and the UE 3, and which provides necessary
connectivity for the CSC-11 and CSC-12 reference points. It is out of scope of
this specification what type of IP-CANs are supported, but could be e.g. USB,
Bluetooth or WLAN.
The offline common services server could be the same entity (or set of
entities) as the common services core. In this case the configuration
management server shall not configure to the same user on the same UE, with
parameters provisioned by offline and online configuration simultaneously. The
configuration management server shall not configure to the same user on the
same UE for the same parameters by using CSC-11 and CSC-4 reference points
simultaneously.
The entities within this model are described in the following subclauses and a
full functional model is given in subclause 7.3.2.
### 9.3.2 UE 3
The UE 3 is a UE using ProSe and supporting application(s) related to off-
network MC service, and is composed of the following functional entities:
\- for MC services, MC service clients as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.1
with relevant application functions of the specific MC service defined in the
corresponding MC service TS;
\- for signalling control, a signalling user agent as described in subclause
7.4.3.1.1;
\- for configuration management, a configuration management client as
described in subclause 7.4.2.2.1; and
\- for group management, a group management client as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.3.
### 9.3.3 UE 4
The UE 4 represents one or more UEs with the same functionality as UE 3.
### 9.3.4 Offline common services server
The offline common services server supports configuration applications related
to MC service, and is composed of the following functional entities:
\- for configuration management, a configuration management server as
described in subclause 7.4.2.2.2; and
\- for group management, a group management server as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.4.
## 9.4 Architecture model for roaming
Roaming is achieved using either:
\- EPC-level roaming as defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]; or
\- IMS-level roaming as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
# 10 Procedures and information flows
## 10.1 MC service configuration
### 10.1.1 General
#### 10.1.1.1 MC service configuration on primary MC system
Depicted in figure 10.1.1.1-1 is a MC service configuration time sequence of
the data related to specific MC service, representing the general lifecycle of
MC service UE using an MC service.
Figure 10.1.1.1-1 MC service UE configuration time sequence and associated
configuration data
The MC service UE is provided with initial UE configuration via a bootstrap
procedure that provides the MC service UE\'s clients (e.g. MC service client,
group management client, configuration management client, identity management
client, key management client, functional alias management client) with
critical information needed to connect to the MC system. This includes PDN
connection information corresponding to the configured MC services on the MC
service UE (see \"EPS bearer considerations\" in the 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) and
on-network server identity information for all application plane servers with
which the MC service UE needs to interact. See annex A.6 for more information.
The MC service UE is provided with UE configuration, MC service user profile
configuration and group configuration via online configuration. While the MC
service UE is using the MC service it may receive online configuration
updates. If the MC service user profile configuration contains multiple MC
service user profiles for an authenticated MC service user, then the MC
service client and MC service server set the active MC service user profile to
the configured pre-selected MC service user profile after MC service
authorization (which can be updated by the MC service user using the procedure
specified in subclause 10.1.4.6). The active MC service user profile can be
changed by the MC service user to a different MC service user profile during
MC service service (see MC service TSs).
The MC service is configured with the service configuration (not shown in the
figure 10.1.1.1-1) which the MC service enforces during the entire phase of MC
service UE using the MC service.
Editor\'s note: The extent of MC services available to an MC service UE with
an unauthenticated MC user or unauthorized MC service user is described as
\'limited services\' in 3GPP TS 33.180 and is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The decision by the MC service UE to continue use of initial
configuration data after MC service authorisation or discontinue its use in
favour of configuration data obtained after MC service authorisation is FFS.
#### 10.1.1.2 MC service configuration for migration to partner MC system
Figure 10.1.1.2‑1 depicts a general MC service configuration time sequence of
the data related to MC service, representing the general lifecycle of MC
service UE which obtains MC service when migrated to a partner MC system. The
MC service user can only receive MC service from one MC system at a time.
Figure 10.1.1.2-1 MC service UE configuration sequence for migration
The MC service user and MC service UE first follow the MC service UE
configuration and MC service user authorization steps described in subclause
10.1.1.1 to obtain one or more MC service user profiles from the primary MC
system. Each user profile received from the primary MC system contains a list
of partner MC systems to which migration is permitted using that user profile,
together with the access information needed to communicate with the
application plane servers of the partner MC system. See Annex A.3 for more
information. The MC service user also obtains the necessary security
parameters needed to authenticate and become service authorized on the partner
MC system; the process for this is specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25]. At this
point, the MC UE is configured sufficiently for the partner system so that the
MC service user is capable of utilizing \"limited services\" as described in
3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
NOTE 1: The above steps which enable migration to take place may be carried
out some time in advance of migration. The MC service user could repeatedly
obtain migrated MC service, e.g. on successive days while located in the area
of the partner MC system, without needing to obtain the initial configuration
afresh in advance of each period of migrated MC service. The user profile from
the primary MC system must be retained to provide the access information to
permit this.
To initiate migration, the desired partner system from those listed in the
chosen user profile is selected, and the access information provided in the
user profile is used to initiate communication with the partner MC system.
NOTE 2: Selection of the relevant partner MC system could be performed as a
result of a manual action by the user or automatically by an application in
the MC service UE, e.g. according to the current location of the MC service UE
or according to the serving PLMN of the MC service UE.
The MC service user performs user authentication to the partner MC system as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25]. The MC service UE performs signalling plane
migration.
NOTE 3: The security aspects of the signalling plane migration are outside the
scope of the present document.
The user profile or profiles for that MC service user which are to be used for
service when migrated to the partner MC system are then downloaded to the
configuration management client in the MC service UE by the partner MC system,
and these downloaded profile or profiles are used by the MC service user
during the ensuing period of MC service on the partner MC system.
NOTE 4: The user profile obtained from the primary MC system is simply used to
provide access information for the partner MC system and is not otherwise used
by the MC service client during migrated MC service.
Group configuration for the MC service groups listed in the user profile are
then obtained by the group management client in the MC service UE. After these
configuration steps, the MC service user obtains service authorization on the
partner MC system.
Once service authorized, further configuration changes may be provided by the
partner MC system during the period of operational MC service, in accordance
with subclause 10.1.1.1. The partner MC system enforces the use of the user
profiles and group configuration that have been provided by the configuration
process described in this subclause.
### 10.1.2 Information flows for MC service configuration
#### 10.1.2.1 Store group configuration request
Table 10.1.2.1-1 describes the information flow store group configuration
request from the group management client to the group management server.

### 10.1.3 MC service UE configuration data
#### 10.1.3.1 General
The MC service UE configuration data has to be known by the MC service UE
before it can use the MC service.
#### 10.1.3.2 Procedures
The procedure for MC service UE obtaining the MC service UE related
configuration data is illustrated in figure 10.1.3.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service UE has the secure access to the configuration management
server.
Figure 10.1.3.2-1: MC service UE obtains the configuration data
1\. The configuration management client sends a get MC service UE
configuration request to the configuration management server for obtaining MC
service UE configuration data.
2\. The configuration management server sends get MC service UE configuration
response to the configuration management client. This message carries the MC
service UE configuration data.
#### 10.1.3.3 Structure of UE configuration data
For a MC service, the MC service UE configuration data is listed in the
corresponding MC service TS.
### 10.1.4 MC service user profile
#### 10.1.4.1 General
An MC service user is identified by an MC service ID. An MC service ID is
associated with at least one MC service user profile and can be associated
with multiple MC service user profiles (identified by an index and optionally
a profile name). This is depicted in figure 10.1.4.1-1.
Figure 10.1.4.1-1: The relationship of MC service user, MC service IDs, MC
service user profile and MC services
For an MC service user there can be multiple MC service IDs with the
constraint that only one MC service ID exists for a given MC service for that
MC service user (e.g. MC service ID X may correspond to MCPTT service and MC
service ID Y may correspond to MCVideo service). When the MC service provider
requires to support a single MC service ID for all MC services, the value of
the multiple MC service IDs is the same (e.g. value of MC service ID X is same
as MC service ID Y).
In the case where a single MC service ID is configured for a MC service user
for authorized access to multiple MC services, the MC service UE and MC
service server shall include the indication of the specific MC service during
the communication.
For the same MC service user there can be different MC service user profiles
active on different MC service UEs or different MC service user profiles
active on the same MC service UE at different times. The MC service user may
have one or more specific MC service user profiles defined for use in
migration cases, whereby there may be more than one MC service user profiles
defined for migration for that MC service user e.g. so that different MC
service user profiles can be applied in different partner MC systems. The
appropriate MC service user profile for migration for the relevant partner MC
system will be provided to the partner MC system by the procedure. For both
the cases of MC service on the primary MC system of the MC service user, and
MC service when migrating to a partner MC system, only one MC service user
profile per MC service client is active at a time.
All MC service user profiles associated with an MC service user are stored in
the MC service user database. Different parts of the MC service user profile
are provisioned by the Mission Critical Organization, by the MC service
provider and by the MC service user, respectively.
MC service user profile information is downloaded to the MC service UE. The MC
service user profile configuration may include more than one information
exchange e.g. the configuration management server may provide the MC service
UE with a list of some or all enabled MC service user profiles to allow the MC
service user to select one (where the list may contain a subset of the MC
service user profile information sufficient for the MC service user to
distinguish which MC service user profile to select).
When an MC service user is receiving MC service in its primary MC system, the
MC service user profile provisioning in the UE is initiated by the
configuration management client (e.g. upon MC service user authentication or
on reconnect to the MC service), or initiated by the configuration management
server (e.g. due to role change or organization change). For a migrating MC
service user, the MC service user profile provisioning in the UE is initiated
when the MC service user attempts to migrate to a partner MC system, and
requests the MC service user profile from a nominated configuration management
server in the partner MC system, prior to requesting service authorization
from a partner MC service server.
The partner MC system may require that the MC service user profiles for
migrating MC service users have parameters imposed by that partner MC system
according to its operating and security policies. For example, there may be
limitations in the locations at which migrating MC users can receive service,
specific priority levels for migrating MC service users or certain groups to
which the migrating MC service users require access. The partner MC system
applies any necessary modifications to the MC service user profile received
from the primary MC system of the MC service user in accordance with its local
requirements. This local profile will be stored, and will be provided to the
configuration management server in the partner MC system in order to
distribute it to the configuration management client of the migrating MC
service user. This modified profile may be sent to the primary MC system of
the migrating MC service user so that the primary MC system can validate the
modified profile before it is provided to the migrating MC service UE. The
modified MC service user profile will subsequently be provided to the MC
service server in the partner MC system when the migrating MC user attempts
service authorization.
Editor\'s note: A reference should be added to configuration tables in Annex A
to indicate where the local configuration policy can be configured.

The procedure for the MC service user obtaining MC service user profiles in
the primary MC system of that MC service user is illustrated in figure
10.1.4.3.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user has performed user authentication in the identity
management server.
\- The MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.
Figure 10.1.4.3.1-1: MC service user obtains the MC service user profile(s)
from the network
1\. The configuration management client sends a get MC service user profile
request message to the configuration management server, which includes the MC
service ID.
2\. The configuration management server obtains the MC service user profile
information.
3\. The configuration management server sends get MC service user profile
response message to the configuration management client. When a download is
necessary, this message includes all MC service user profiles that are
associated with the MC service ID.
##### 10.1.4.3.2 MC service user receiving MC service from a partner MC system
Figure 10.1.4.3.2-1 below illustrates mechanism for the configuration
management client to retrieve the MC service user profile for the migrating MC
service user from the partner MC system.
NOTE: Any proxy servers at the edges of the primary and partner MC systems
which are used to hide the topology of the MC systems from external entities
are not shown in this procedure.
Preconditions
\- The MC service user is permitted to migrate to the partner MC system, and
the relevant authorizations are configured in both the primary and partner MC
systems of that MC service user
\- The MC service user has performed MC service user authentication in the
partner MC system, and has received the necessary credentials to retrieve
configuration information and to request service authorization.
\- The MC service UE has been provided with addressing information to allow
the configuration management client in the MC service UE to access the
configuration management server in the partner MC system.
Figure 10.1.4.3.2-1: Retrieval of user profile in partner MC system
1\. The configuration management client in the MC service UE of the migrating
MC service user requests the MC service user profile for migration from the
configuration management server in the partner MC system.
2\. The configuration management server in the partner MC system requests the
MC service user profile from the configuration management server in the
primary MC system of the MC service user.
3\. The configuration management server in the primary MC system of the MC
service user retrieves the MC service user profile from the MC service user
database in that primary MC system. The identification of the partner MC
system to which the MC service user is attempting to migrate is used to
determine which MC service user profile is retrieved for that MC service user
for migration to that partner MC system.
4\. The configuration management server in the primary MC system provides the
MC service user profile to the configuration management server in the partner
MC system of the MC service user, optionally requesting validation of the
modified MC service user profile.
5\. The partner MC system of the MC service user modifies the MC service user
profile according to local configuration information and stores the modified
MC service user profile in the MC service user database in the partner MC
system.
6\. If the primary MC system requested validation of the MC service user
profile in step 4, the configuration management server in the partner MC
system of the migrating MC service user may send the modified MC service user
profile to the configuration management server of the primary MC system of the
MC service user to allow the primary MC system of the MC service user to
validate the modified MC service user profile.
7\. The primary MC system of the migrated MC service user validates the
modified MC service profile of the migrated MC service user.
8\. The primary MC system of the migrated MC service user responds to the
partner MC system with the results of the validation process.
9\. The configuration management server in the partner MC system provides the
MC service user profile to the configuration management client of the
migrating MC service user,
NOTE: Step 9 is not followed if the validation process fails.
#### 10.1.4.4 MC service user receives updated MC service user profile data
from the network
The procedure for MC service user obtaining updated MC service user profile
data (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) that is initiated by the network is illustrated
in figure 10.1.4.4-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user has performed user authentication in identity
management server.
\- The MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.
\- The MC service UE has already obtained one or more MC service user
profiles.
\- The configuration management server has access to the MC service user
profile(s) associated with the MC service ID of the MC service user.
Figure 10.1.4.4-1: MC service user receives updated MC service user profile
data from the network
1\. The configuration management server obtains updated MC service user
profile data.
2\. The configuration management server sends a notification for MC service
user profile data update to the configuration management client.
3\. The configuration management client sends get updated MC service user
profile data request to the configuration management server, which includes
the MC service ID.
4\. The configuration management server sends get updated MC service user
profile data response to the configuration management client which includes
the updated MC service user profile data requested in step 3.
NOTE: The updated MC service user profile data could be for a specific MC
service user profile, a specific parameter in an MC service user profile, a
set of MC service user profiles, or all the MC service user profiles for the
MC service ID. MC service user profile data is defined per MC service. E.g.
the MC service user profile data related to MCPTT is defined in 3GPP TS 23.379
[16].
#### 10.1.4.5 MC service user updates MC service user profile data to the
network
The procedure for MC service user updating the MC service user profile data
(see 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) is illustrated in figure 10.1.4.5-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user has performed user authentication in identity
management server.
\- The MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.
\- The MC service UE has already obtained one or more MC service user
profiles.
Figure 10.1.4.5-1: MC service user updates MC service user profile data to the
network
1\. The configuration management client is triggered (e.g. by user interaction
operation) to update the MC service user profile data on the configuration
management server.
2\. The configuration management client sends update MC service user profile
data request to the configuration management server, which includes the MC
service user profile data to be updated.
3\. The configuration management server stores the received MC service user
profile data.
4\. The configuration management server sends update MC service user profile
data response to the configuration management client to confirm the MC service
user profile data update is complete.
NOTE: The updated MC service user profile data could be for a specific MC
service user profile, a specific parameter in an MC service user profile, a
set of MC service user profiles, or all the MC service user profiles for the
MC service ID. MC service user profile data is defined per MC service. E.g.
the MC service user profile data related to MCPTT is defined in 3GPP TS 23.379
[16].
#### 10.1.4.6 Updating the pre-selected MC service user profile
The procedure for updating the pre-selected MC service user profile in the
configuration for an MC service UE by the MC service user is illustrated in
figure 10.1.4.6-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user has performed user authentication in identity
management server.
\- The MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.
\- The MC service UE has already obtained one or more MC service user
profiles.
\- The configuration management client is triggered (e.g. by user interaction,
by some automated means) to change the pre-selected MC service user profile.
Figure 10.1.4.6-1: MC service user updates the pre-selected MC service user
profile
1\. The configuration management client sends update pre-selected MC service
user profile request to the configuration management server, which includes
the MC service user\'s MC service ID and an MC service user profile index that
indicates which MC service user profile is to be pre-selected by the MC
service server at next MC service authorization.
2\. The configuration management server checks the authorization of the update
pre-selected MC service user profile request.
3\. The configuration management server stores the received pre-selected MC
service user profile selection.
4\. The configuration management server sends update pre-selected MC service
user profile response to the configuration management client to confirm the
pre-selected MC service user profile has been set.
NOTE: Steps 3 to 4 can occur in any order or in parallel.
For each update pre-selected MC service user profile request to the MC service
user profile, the configuration management server determines whether the
requested update is allowed prior to storing the configuration parameters and
updating the MC service user database (via the CSC-13 reference point as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.283 [19]).
After each update to the MC service user profile in the MC service user
database, the MC service server receives the changes from the MC service user
profile database via the corresponding MC service reference point defined
between MC service server and the MC service user database, and all of the MC
service UEs associated with the MC service user receive the updated MC service
user profile as specified in subclause 10.1.4.4.
A change to the pre-selected MC service user profile while the MC service user
is receiving MC service does not have any effect on the active MC service user
profile, however, the change will be applied at the next MC service
authorization.
Editor\'s note: Specifying pre-selected MC service user profile specific to
each UE associated with an MC service user is FFS.
#### 10.1.4.7 Updating the selected MC service user profile for an MC service
The procedure for updating the selected MC service user profile within a
single MC service for an MC service UE by the MC service user whilst the MC
service user is receiving that MC service service is illustrated in figure
10.1.4.7-1. This procedure is used by the following MC services:
\- MCPTT (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]);
\- MCVideo (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]); and
\- MCData (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]).
Pre-conditions:
\- For the MC service (see list above) for which the selected MC service user
profile is to be updated:
\- The MC service user has performed user authentication in the identity
management server.
\- The MC service UE has secure access to the MC service server.
\- The MC service UE has already obtained multiple MC service user profiles.
\- The MC service UE has performed MC service authorization.
\- The MC service client is triggered (e.g. by user interaction, by some
automated means) to select a particular MC service user profile as active.
Figure 10.1.4.7-1: MC service user updates the selected MC service user
profile
1\. MC service client sends update selected MC service user profile request to
the MC service server, which includes the MC service user\'s MC service ID and
an MC service user profile index that indicates which MC service user profile
is selected to be currently active for MC service client.
2\. If the MPCTT server does not have stored the MC service user profile data
for the MC service user, then the MC service server obtains the MC service
user profile data.
3\. The MC service server stores the selected MC service user profile index
for the MC service client.
NOTE 1: Different MC service user profiles can be active for different MC
service clients of the same MC service user.
4\. If the MC service server does not have stored the group configuration data
for the selected MC service user profile then the MC service server obtains
group configuration data according to the selected MC service user profile
(see subclause 10.1.5.2) and subscribes to updates of the group configuration
data (see subclause 10.1.5.3).
5\. The MC service server sends update selected MC service user profile
response to the MC service client to confirm the active MC service user
profile has been set.
NOTE 2: Steps 4 to 5 can occur in any order or in parallel.
6\. If the MC service client does not have stored the group configuration data
for the selected MC service user profile then the MC service client obtains
group configuration data according to the successfully selected MC service
user profile (see subclauase 10.1.5.2) and subscribes to updates of the group
configuration data (see subclause 10.1.5.3).
After each of the MC service server and the MC service UE have successfully
negotiated a selected MC service user profile, then both the MC service server
and the MC service UE, based upon the selected MC service user profile, clear
any currently active service state from any previously selected or pre-
selected MC service user profile data (including deaffiliating from relevant
groups, disconnecting any MC service calls) and process the successfully
negotiated selected MC service user profile data e.g. perform any needed
affiliations.

## 10.2 Group management (on-network)
### 10.2.1 General
Group management procedures apply to on-network MC service only.
Group creation provides a dedicated MC service group to individual MC service
users to enable the required communication for one or multiple MC services.
This includes the normal group creation by administrators as well as user
regrouping by authorized user/dispatcher.
For an MC service, group regrouping enables dispatchers or authorized users to
temporarily combine several MC service groups.
NOTE 1: If an authorized MC service user wants to participate in a new group
created by the authorized MC service user, then the authorized MC service user
needs to have been included in the new group as a member and have affiliated
to the new group.
NOTE 2: If an authorized MC service user wants to participate in a temporary
group created by a group regroup operation performed by this authorized MC
service user, then the authorized MC service user needs to have been an
existing member of and affiliated to at least one of the constituent groups
that was part of the associated group regroup operation and have affiliated to
the new temporary group.

### 10.2.3 Group creation
Figure 10.2.3-1 below illustrates the group creation operations by authorized
MC service user/ MC service administrator to create a group. It applies to the
scenario of normal group creation by an MC service administrator and user
regrouping operations by authorized user/dispatcher.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client, group management server, MC service server
and the MC service group members belong to the same MC system.
2\. The administrator/authorized user/dispatcher is aware of the users\'
identities which will be combined to form the MC service group.
Figure 10.2.3-1: Group creation
1\. The group management client of the administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC
service user requests group create operation to the group management server.
The identities of the users being combined and the information of the MC
services that are enabled on the group shall be included in this message.
NOTE 1: The administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC service user can include a
proposed MC service group ID in the group creation request. The proposed MC
service group ID can be derived from a set of rules previously agreed between
the administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC service user and the group
management server. The method by which the the
administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC service user obtains the set of rules
is outside the scope of the present document.
NOTE 2: The administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC service user can include
configuration data for the requested group. The method by which the
administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC service user prepares the configuration
data for the requested group is outside the scope of the present document, but
it could, for example, be derived from pre-prepared templates available to the
administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC service user.
2a. If the proposed MC service group ID information element is not present in
the group creation request, the group management server generates the MC
service group ID. If the proposed MC service group ID information element is
present and acceptable to the group management server, the group management
server uses the proposed MC service group ID for the new group. If the
proposed MC service group ID information element is present but not acceptable
to the group management server, the group management server modifies proposed
MC service group ID or generates the MC service group ID or rejects the group
creation request.
2b. During the group creation, the group management server stores or creates
and stores the information of the group as group configuration data as
described in subclause 10.1.5.4. The group management server performs the
check on the maximum limit of the total number (Nc6) of MC service group
members for the MC service group(s).
3\. The group management server may conditionally notify the MC service server
regarding the group creation with the information of the group members (if
any). During user regroup, the group management server notifies the MC service
server regarding the group creation with the information of the temporary
group members. The MC service users of the temporary group may be
automatically affiliated, if configured on the MC service server.
4\. The MC service group members (if any) of the MC service group are notified
about the newly created MC service group configuration data.
5\. The group management server provides a group creation response to the
group management client of the administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC service
user. The result information element indicates:
\- success (using proposed MC service group ID); or
\- success (MC service group ID provided by the group management server); or
\- failure (proposed MC service group ID not acceptable); or
\- failure for other reason.
### 10.2.4 Group regrouping
#### 10.2.4.1 Temporary group formation - group regrouping within an MC system
Figure 10.2.4.1-1 below illustrates the group regroup operations to create a
temporary group within an MC system. For simplicity, only the case of two MC
service groups being combined is represented, but the procedure is the same if
more than two groups are combined.
The temporary group formation is applicable only for groups configured with at
least one common MC service. The temporary group formation shall be rejected
if any of the requested MC services are not common to all MC service groups in
the list.
The temporary group created can be a broadcast group or a non-broadcast group.
The broadcast regroup is used for one-way communication where only an
authorized MCX user is allowed to transmit and all other regroup members are
only allowed to receive the communication (e.g. a call from a dispatcher to
all regroup members). The non-broadcast regroup is used for two-way
communication where all regroup members can transmit and receive (i.e, the
regroup group call behaves like a normal non-broadcast group call). The
broadcast regroup satisfies the temporary group-broadcast group requirements
defined in 3GPP TS 22.180 [2] and is an alternative to the \"Temporary group
-- broadcast group call\" procedure (10.6.2.5.3) defined in 3GPP TS 23.379
[16].
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client, group management server, MC service server
and the MC service group members belong to the same MC system.
2\. The group management client has retrieved the group configurations of the
groups to be regrouped.
Figure 10.2.4.1-1: Group regroup for the groups within the same MC system
1\. The group management client of the MC service user requests group regroup
operation to the group management server, which is the group management server
of one of the groups to be regrouped. The identities of the groups being
combined shall be included in this message. The group management client may
indicate the security level required for the temporary group. The group
management client may indicate the priority level required for the temporary
group. The group management client indicates whether the temporary group is a
broadcast regroup.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy. The group
management server checks whether group1 or group2 is a temporary group. If
group 1 or group2 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be
rejected, otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary MC service group ID, the MC service
group ID of the groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary
group, the security level of the temporary group, and whether the temporary
group is a broadcast regroup. If the authorized MC service user does not
specify the security level and the priority level, the group management server
shall set the lowest security level and the highest priority of the
constituent groups. If MC service types of the groups being combined are not
identical, group management server determines the overlapping part and stores
the MC service list for the temporary group.
4\. The group management server notifies the MC service server regarding the
temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups, i.e.
temporary MC service group ID, group1\'s MC service group ID and group2\'s MC
service group ID. If MC service list is included, MC service server stores it
and provides MC service types accordingly.
5\. The group management server notifies the affiliated MC service group
members of the constituent MC service groups by sending group regroup
notification messages.
6\. The affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service
groups send individual group regroup notification response messages.
7\. The group management server provides a group regroup response to the group
management client of the authorized MC service user. If MC service list is
included, group management client stores it and initiates MC service types
accordingly.
8\. The affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service
groups individually request group configuration data from the group management
server for the temporary group, as described in clause 10.1.5.2. The group
configuration data includes security, priority, and other parameters.
#### 10.2.4.2 Temporary group formation involving multiple MC systems
Figure 10.2.4.2-1 below illustrates the group regroup operations to create a
temporary group involving multiple MC systems. For simplicity, only the case
of two MC service groups being combined is represented, but the procedure is
the same if more than two groups are combined.
NOTE: The temporary group formation is applicable only for groups configured
with the same MC service(s).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MC system does not share
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The primary MC system consists of the group management server 1 and MC
service server (primary). The partner MC system consists of the group
management server 2 and MC service server (partner).
3\. The group management client of the authorized MC service user belongs to
the primary MC system.
4\. The group management client has retrieved the group configurations of the
groups to be regrouped.
Figure 10.2.4.2-1: Temporary group formation - group regrouping involving
multiple MC systems
1\. The group management client of the MC service user (e.g. dispatcher)
requests group regroup operation to the group management server 1 (which is
the group management server of one of the groups to be regrouped). The
identities of the groups being combined shall be included in this message. The
group management client may indicate the security level required for the
temporary group. The group management client may indicate the priority level
required for the temporary group. The group management client indicates
whether the temporary group is a broadcast regroup.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy. The group
management server 1 checks whether group1 is a temporary group. If group1 is a
temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected, otherwise the
group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server 1 forwards the group regroup request to the
target group management server 2 with the information of the group management
server 2 MC service groups.
4\. The group management server 2 checks whether group2 is a temporary group.
If group2 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected,
otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.
5\. The group management server 2 provides a group regroup response. Due to
security aspects concerning sharing information among different MC systems,
the group management server 2 does not share the users\' information of the
groups under its management to the group management server 1. Any regroup
action that violates the rules specified in subclause 10.2.4.4 shall cause a
negative response and the current procedure to proceed to step 15.
NOTE: If there is a trust relationship between the primary MC service provider
and the partner MC service provider, the partner MC system can share their
users\' information to the primary MC system at this step. If there is a
change in partner MC system\'s constituent group membership, the
synchronization procedure with the primary MC system for temporary group is
out of scope of this specification
6\. The group management server 1 creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary MC service group ID, off-network
information, and the MC service IDs of the groups being combined, the priority
level of the temporary group, the security level of the temporary group, and
whether the temporary group is a broadcast regroup. If the authorized MC
service user does not specify the security level and the priority level, the
group management server shall set the lower security level and the higher
priority of the constituent groups.
7\. The group management server 1 notifies the group management server 2 about
its group regroup operation.
8\. The group management server 2 acknowledges the group management server 1
and the group management server 2 also stores the information about the
temporary group including the temporary MC service group ID, the MC service
group IDs of the groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary
group and the security level of the temporary group.
9\. The group management server 2 notifies the partner MC service server
regarding the temporary group creation with the information of the constituent
groups i.e. temporary MC service group ID, group1\'s MC service group ID and
group2\'s MC service group ID.
10\. Partner MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server 2.
11\. The group management server 2 notifies the affiliated MC service group
members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server 2,
possibly with an indication of a lower security level.
12\. The affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service
groups of the group management server 2 send individual group regroup
notification responses to the group management server 2.
13\. The group management server 1 notifies the MC service server of the
primary system regarding the temporary group creation with the information of
the constituent groups, i.e. temporary MC service group ID, group1\'s MC
service group ID and group2\'s MC service group ID. If there are active calls
to be merged, then the group management server 1 includes an indication to
merge active calls.
14\. Primary MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server 1.
15\. The group management server 1 notifies the affiliated MC service group
members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server 1
by sending group regroup notification messages.
16\. The affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service
groups of group management server 1 send individual group regroup notification
responses to the group management server 1.
17\. The group management server 1 provides a group regroup response to the
group management client of the authorized MC service user (e.g. dispatcher).
18\. The affiliated MC service group members of the constituent MC service
groups of the group management servers individually request group
configuration data from the group management servers for the temporary group,
as described in clause 10.1.5.2. The group configuration data includes
security, priority, and other parameters.
#### 10.2.4.2a Temporary group tear down within an MC system
Figure 10.2.4.2a-1 below illustrates the tearing down procedure of temporary
group created through the group regroup operation. The procedure can be used
when, e.g., the specific task for which the temporary group was created has
been completed or a busier period occurs. For simplicity, only the teardown
case for a temporary group with two MC service groups is represented. The
procedure is applicable for more than two groups combined in this temporary
group.
Pre-condition:
\- The temporary group to be torn down is comprised of multiple MC service
groups, and is created through the group regrouping procedure as described in
subclause 10.2.4.1.
Figure 10.2.4.2a-1: Temporary group tear down within an MC system
1\. The group management client of the MC service user requests group regroup
teardown operation to the group management server (which is the group
management server where the temporary group is created and stored). The
identity of the temporary group (MC service group ID) being torn down shall be
included in this message. This message may route through some other signalling
nodes.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy. The group
management server checks whether the MC service group ID is a temporary group.
If MC service group ID is not a temporary group, then the group regroup
teardown request will be rejected, otherwise the group regroup teardown can
proceed.
3\. The group management server tears down the temporary group, i.e., remove
the temporary group related information.
4\. The group management server notifies the MC service server regarding the
temporary group teardown.
5\. Any active group call for the temporary group is preserved until it is
completed.
6\. The group management server notifies the affiliated MC service group
members regarding the temporary group teardown by sending the group regroup
teardown notification (6a) and receives a group regroup teardown notification
response (6b) messages.
7\. The group management server provides a group regroup teardown confirmation
response to the group management client of the authorized MC service user.
#### 10.2.4.3 Temporary group tear down involving multiple group host servers
Figure 10.2.4.3-1 below illustrates the tearing down procedure of temporary
group created through the group regroup operation. The procedure can be used
when, e.g., the specific task for which the temporary group was created has
been completed or a busier period occurs. For simplicity, only the teardown
case for a temporary group with two MC service groups is represented. The
procedure is applicable for more than two groups combined in this temporary
group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, it considers the partner MC system does not share
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The primary MC system consists of the group management server 1 and MC
service server (primary). The partner MC system consists of the group
management server 2 and MC service server (partner).
3\. The group management client of the authorized MC service user belongs to
the primary MC system.
4\. The temporary group to be torn down is comprised of multiple MC service
groups, and is created through the group regrouping procedure as described in
subclause 10.2.4.2.
Figure 10.2.4.3-1: Temporary group tear down
1\. The group management client of the MC service user requests group regroup
teardown operation to the group management server 1 (which is the group
management server where the temporary group is created and stored). The
identity of the temporary group (MC service group ID) being torn down shall be
included in this message. This message may route through some other signalling
nodes.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy. The group
management server 1 checks whether the MC service group ID is a temporary
group. If MC service group ID is not a temporary group, then the group regroup
teardown request will be rejected, otherwise the group regroup teardown can
proceed.
3\. The group management server 1 tears down the temporary group, i.e., remove
the temporary group related information.
4\. The group management server 1 notifies the primary MC service server
regarding the temporary group teardown.
5\. Any active group call for the temporary group is preserved until it is
completed.
6\. The group management server 1 notifies the affiliated MC service group
members regarding the temporary group teardown by sending the group regroup
teardown notification (6a) and receives a group regroup teardown notification
response (6b) messages.
7\. The group management server 1 sends a group regroup teardown notification
(7a) and receives a group regroup teardown notification response (7b) messages
with the group management server 2 -- group management server in another MC
system regarding the temporary group teardown.
8\. The group management server 2 notifies the partner MC service server.
9\. The group management server 2 notifies the affiliated MC service group
members regarding the temporary group teardown by sending the group regroup
teardown notification (9a) and receives a group regroup teardown notification
response (9b) messages. Any active group call for the temporary group is
preserved until it is completed.
10\. The group management server 1 provides a group regroup teardown
confirmation response to the group management client of the authorized MC
service user.
#### 10.2.4.4 Group regroup rules
To prevent routing issues and complexity related to group regrouping, the
following rules shall be applied:
\- Group regroup in either single MC system or multiple MC systems can take
place if:
> \- None of the groups to be regrouped are temporary groups; and
>
> \- The groups to be regrouped are not already regrouped into another
> temporary group; and
>
> \- If the policy of the MC system does not allow a temporary group to
> include groups that are currently in emergency state, then regrouping of
> groups can take place if none of the groups to be regrouped are in emergency
> state.
\- If the policy of the MC system allows a temporary group to include groups
from other MC systems, group regrouping containing groups with multiple MC
systems can take place if:
\- the MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is the MC
service server (controlling role) for all MC service groups involved in the
regrouping; or
\- the MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is an MC
service server (controlling role) for at least one of the MC service groups
involved in the regrouping; or
\- the MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is an MC
service server homed by at least one of the MC service groups and the MC
system of any involved MC service group allows floor control for the set of
regrouped groups to be deferred to the MC service server (controlling role) of
the temporary group.
\- If the policy of the MC system does not allow a temporary group to include
groups from other MC systems, regrouping of groups with members spanning
multiple MC systems can take place if:
\- the MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is the MC
service server (controlling role) for all MC service groups involved in the
regrouping; or
\- the MC service server (controlling role) for the regrouped group is an MC
service server (controlling role) for at least one of the MC service groups
involved in the regrouping, and the MC service servers with the controlling
roles for all of the groups that are regrouped are within the same MC system.
### 10.2.5 Membership and affiliation list query
#### 10.2.5.1 General
An MC service user can request the membership or affiliation list on an MC
service group regardless the user\'s group membership or affiliation.
#### 10.2.5.2 Procedure
Figure 10.2.5.2-1 below illustrates the membership or affiliation list query
on an MC service group.
Figure 10.2.5.2-1: membership or affiliation list query
1\. The group management client of the MC servicer user requests the
membership or affiliation list on the MC service group from the group
management server by sending a group information query request. The query type
is included.
2\. The group management server checks whether the MC servicer user is
authorized to perform the query. If authorized, then the group management
server retrieves the requested group information based on the query type.
3\. The group management server sends a group information query response
including the retrieved group information to the group management client.
### 10.2.6 Group membership
#### 10.2.6.1 Group membership notification
Figure 10.2.6.1-1 illustrates the group membership notification operations to
the MC service server(s) and group management clients upon the group
membership change at group management server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management server and MC service server serve the same MC
system.
Figure 10.2.6.1-1: group membership notification
1\. The membership of a specific MC service group is changed at group
management server.
2\. The group management server notifies the MC service server(s) regarding
the group membership change with the information of the updated group members.
3\. The group management server updates the group management clients of the MC
service users who have been added to or removed from the group.
4\. The group management client requests to retrieve the relevant group
configurations from group management server by procedure defined in subclause
10.1.5.2, if the user is added to the group. If the user is deleted from the
group, the locally stored group configurations in the MC service UE may be
removed.
#### 10.2.6.2 Group membership update by authorized user
Figure 10.2.6.2-1 below illustrates the group membership update operations by
an authorized user/administrator/dispatcher to change the membership a MC
service group (e.g. to add or delete group members).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management server and MC service server serve the same MC
system;
2\. The initiator of this operation is aware of the current group membership
of the MC service group;
3\. The Administrator/dispatcher/authorized user is aware of the users\'
identities which will be added to or deleted from the MC service group.
Figure 10.2.6.2-1: Group membership update by authorized user
1\. The group management client of the administrator/dispatcher/authorized
user requests group membership update operation to the group management
server.
2\. The group management server updates the group membership information. The
group management server may perform the check on the maximum limit of the
total number (Nc6) of MC service group members.
3\. The group management server notifies the MC service server(s) regarding
the group membership change with the information of the updated group members.
4\. The group members that are added to or deleted from the group by this
operation are notified about the group membership change. This step may be
followed by retrieving group configurations defined in subclause 10.1.5.2
5\. The group management server provides a group membership response to the
group management client of the administrator/dispatcher/authorized user.
### 10.2.7 Group configuration for interconnection
#### 10.2.7.1 Overview
The procedures in the following subclauses describe the process for sharing
group configuration from a primary MC system of the MC service group to an
interconnected partner MC system of the MC service group where MC service
clients receiving MC service in the partner MC system of the MC service group
need to make use of the MC service group.
The group management server in the primary MC system of the MC service group
provides group configuration information to the group management server in the
partner MC system of the MC service group. The group management server in the
primary MC system of the MC service group may modify the configuration before
providing it to that partner MC system in accordance with policies and
requirements within the primary MC system (for example the list of members of
the group within the primary MC system or within other partner MC systems
might not be exposed to that partner system). **[The means by which the group
management server in the primary system determines which configuration
parameters are changed is outside the scope of the present
document.]{.underline}**
The group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service group
may modify the configuration before storing it in accordance with policies and
requirements within that MC system (for example the priority of the group
within that partner MC system, or permitted locations for service within that
partner MC system). The group management server in the partner MC system of
the MC service group will be the source of group configuration information to
the group management clients of any MC service user who is receiving MC
service in the partner MC system of the MC service group and who is defined as
a member of the MC service group. The list of groups in the user profile for
those group members in the partner MC system of the MC service group will
contain the address of this group management server in the partner MC system
of the MC service group as the address of the server from which to obtain the
MC service group configuration for this MC service group.
The procedures in the following subclauses describe the cases where the
provision of configuration information is initiated by the group management
server in the primary MC system of the MC service group, and where the
configuration is requested by the group management server in the partner MC
system of the MC service group. There may be additional proxy servers in
between the two group management servers on the edges of one or both MC
systems so that each group management server is not aware of the network
topology of the other MC system. These additional proxy servers are not shown
in these procedures.
#### 10.2.7.2 Primary MC system provides group configuration to the partner MC
system
Figure 10.2.7.2-1 below illustrates the case where the primary MC system of
the MC service group provides the group configuration to the partner MC system
of the MC service group, e.g. due to an action by an administrator or because
the primary MC system of some of the MC service group members is the partner
MC system of the MC service group.
Preconditions
\- The MC service group is defined in its primary MC system.
\- One or more MC service group members are defined in the partner MC system.
\- The primary MC system of the MC service group has been configured with
addressing information for the group management server in the partner MC
system of the MC service group.
\- The primary MC system of the MC service group is authorized to provide
group configuration information to the partner MC system of the MC service
group.
NOTE 1: The primary MC system of the MC service group could be configured with
an address of the group management server within the partner MC system of the
MC service group which is a proxy address, and routing within the partner MC
system of the MC service group determines which actual group management server
is the correct server to receive the configuration information.
NOTE 2: The group management server within the partner MC system of the MC
service group is responsible for providing MC service group configuration
information to MC service group members for whom the partner MC system of the
MC service group is their serving MC system.
Figure 10.2.7.2-1: Primary MC system provides group configuration to partner
MC system
1\. The group management server in the primary MC system of the MC service
group provides the configuration information related to the MC service group
to the group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service
group.
NOTE 3: The group management server in the primary MC system can modify the
group configuration information in accordance with local policies and local
requirements before it is provided to the partner MC system. **[Such
modification is outside the scope of the present document.]{.underline}**
2\. The group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service
group modifies the group configuration information received from the primary
MC system of the MC service group according to the partner MC system\'s
policies and local configuration information.

group stores the modified group configuration.
4\. The group management server in the partner MC system may notify the MC
service server(s) in the partner MC system of the MC service group of the MC
service group configuration.
5\. The group management server of the partner MC system of the MC service
group responds to the group management server of the primary MC system of the
MC service group that the configuration has been received and stored
correctly.
#### 10.2.7.3 Partner MC system requests group configuration from the primary
MC system
Figure 10.2.7.3-1 below illustrates the case where the partner MC system of
the MC service group requests the group configuration from the primary MC
system of the MC service group, for example because an MC service user
receiving service in the partner MC system of the MC service group has the
group configured in the user profile.
Preconditions
\- The MC service group is defined in its primary MC system.
\- The MC service group is configured in the MC service user profiles of one
or more MC service users in the partner MC system of the MC service group.
\- At least one of the MC service users in the partner MC system of the MC
service group that is listed as an MC service group member of the MC service
group has become MC service authorized with the MC service server in the
partner MC system of the MC service group.
\- The group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service
group does not have the configuration for the MC service group stored.
\- The partner MC system of the MC service group has been configured with
addressing information for the group management server in the primary MC
system of the MC service group.
\- The partner MC system of the MC service group is authorized to request
group configuration information from the primary MC system of the group.
NOTE 1: The partner MC system of the MC service group could be configured with
an address of the group management server within the primary MC system of the
MC service group which is a proxy address, and routing within the primary MC
system of the MC service group determines which actual group management server
is the correct server to provide the configuration information.
NOTE 2: The group management server within the partner MC system of the MC
service group is responsible for providing group configuration information to
MC service group members for whom the partner MC system of the MC service
group is their serving MC system.
Figure 10.2.7.3-1: Partner MC system requests group configuration from primary
MC system
1\. The MC service server in the partner MC system of the MC service group
requests the group configuration information from the group management server

group requests the group configuration from the group management server in the
primary MC system of the MC service group.
3\. The group management server in the primary MC system of the MC service
group provides the requested group configuration information.
NOTE 3: The group management server in the primary MC system can modify the
group configuration information in accordance with local policies and local
requirements before it is provided to the partner MC system. **[Such
modification is outside the scope of the present document.]{.underline}**
4\. The group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service
group modifies the group configuration information received from the primary
MC system of the MC service group according to the partner MC system\'s
policies and local configuration information.
5\. The group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service
group stores the modified group configuration.
6\. The group management server in the partner MC system notifies the MC
service server(s) in the partner MC system of the MC service group of the MC
service group configuration.
#### 10.2.7.4 Partner MC system subscribes to group configuration
The procedure for subscription from the group management server in the partner
system for group configuration information to the group management server in
the primary MC system of the MC service group is shown in figure 10.2.7.4-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service group is defined in its primary MC system.
\- One or more MC service group members are defined in the partner MC system.
\- The GMS in the partner MC system of the MC service group has received group
configuration information from the GMS in the primary MC system of the MC
service group.
Figure 10.2.7.4-1: Subscription from partner MC system to primary MC system
for MC service group configuration
1\. The group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service
group subscribes to the group configuration information stored in the group
management server in the primary MC system of the MC service group.
2\. The group management server in the primary MC system of the MC service
group provides a group information subscribe response to the group management
server in the partner MC system of the MC service group indicating success or
failure of the request.
#### 10.2.7.5 Primary MC system notifies group configuration
The procedure for notification of group configuration information from the
group management server in the primary MC system of the MC service group to
the group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service group
is shown in figure 10.2.7.5-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service
group has subscribed to the group configuration information for the MC service
group in the group management server in the primary MC system of the MC
service group.
\- The group management server in the primary MC system of the MC service
group has received and stored new group configuration information for the MC
service group, or the group management server in the primary MC system of the
MC service group has generated and stored new key material, or both of these
have occurred.
Figure 10.2.7.5-1: Notification of group configuration information to partner
MC system of MC service group
1\. The group management server in the primary MC system of the MC service
group provides the notification to the group management server in the partner
MC system of the MC service group, Optionally, the notify group configuration
request may contain group related key material for the group management
client.
2\. The group management server in the partner MC system of the MC service
group provides a notify group information notify response to the group
management server in the primary MC system of the MC service group indicating
the success or failure of the notification.
Following completion of the notification procedure, the group management
server in the partner MC system of the MC service group stores the group
configuration information and any key material provided.
### 10.2.8 Group deletion
Figure 10.2.8-1 below illustrates the group deletion procedure by an
authorized MC service user/ MC service administrator to delete a group in the
primary MC system. Any actions taken by the group management clients on the UE
after receiving the group deletion notification are outside the scope of this
procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management clients, the group management server, and the MC
service server belong to the same MC system.
2\. The group management client (originator) is for an authorized user with
authorization to perform the group deletion.
Figure 10.2.8-1: Group deletion
1\. The group management client (originator) of an authorized MC service user
sends a group deletion request to the group management server.2. The group
management server checks whether the MC service user is authorized to perform
the group deletion operation. For an authorized MC service user, the group
management server will proceed to delete the group and move to step 3. If the
MC service user is not authorized, then the group management server will not
delete the group and move to step 5 sending a group deletion response failure.
3\. The group management server sends a group deletion notification to the MC
service server of the group as well as any MC service servers subscribed to
the group. When a group is configured for multiple MC services, the group
deletion notification is sent from the group management server to all MC
service servers subscribed to the group. Affiliations to the deleted group
will be removed.
NOTE 1: Any actions taken by the MC service server upon receiving the group
deletion notification are not shown in this procedure. Whether ongoing calls
associated with the group deletion are impacted is left to implementation.
4\. The group management server sends the group deletion notification to group
management clients for all group members of the deleted group. MC service
client affiliations to the deleted group are removed.
NOTE 2: It is assumed in this flow that the group management client
(originator) is not a member of the group, so it does not receive a group
deletion notification.
5\. The group management server sends a group deletion response to the group
management client (originator).
## 10.3 Pre-established session (on-network)
### 10.3.1 General
A pre-established session is a session established between an MC service
client and the MC service server, on a per MC service basis, to exchange
necessary media parameters needed for the definition of media bearers,
allowing a faster set-up of MC service calls/sessions.
After a pre-established session is established, a media bearer carrying the
media and media control messages is always active. The MC service client
establishes one or more pre-established sessions to an MC service server after
SIP registration, and prior to initiating any MC service related procedures
(e.g. calls, sessions) to other MC service users. When establishing a pre-
established session, the MC service client negotiates the media parameters,
including establishing IP addresses and ports using interactive connectivity
establishment (ICE) as specified in IETF RFC 5245 [22], which later can be
used in MC service calls/sessions. This avoids the need to negotiate media
parameters (including evaluating ICE candidates) and reserving bearer
resources during the MC service call/session establishment that results in
delayed MC service call/session establishment.
The use of pre-established session on the origination side is completely
compatible with the use of on demand session on the termination side. The use
of pre-established session on the termination side is completely compatible
with the use of on demand session on the origination side.
The pre-established session may be modified by the MC service client and the
MC service server using the SIP procedures for session modification.
The pre-established session may be released by the MC service client and the
MC service server using the SIP procedures for terminating a SIP session.
### 10.3.2 Procedures
#### 10.3.2.1 General
The pre-established session can be established after MC service authorization
for the user (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]).
The pre-established session is a session establishment procedure between the
MC service client and the MC service server to exchange necessary media
parameters needed for the definition of the media bearers. After the pre-
established session is established, the media bearer carrying the floor
control messages is always active. Additionally, the MC service client is able
to activate the media bearer carrying the voice whenever needed:
\- immediately after the pre-established session procedure; or
\- using SIP signalling when an MC service call is initiated.
#### 10.3.2.2 Pre-established session establishment
The pre-established session is a session between the MC service client and the
MC service server in the MC system, and which may utilise other functional
entities (e.g. a media distribution function, as defined in subclause
7.4.2.3.5, for means of obtaining media parameters and gathering ICE
candidates). Figure 10.3.2.2-1 represents the pre-established session
establishment flow.
Figure 10.3.2.2-1: Pre-established session establishment
1\. The MC service client within the MC service UE gathers ICE candidates.
2\. The MC service client within the MC service UE sends a request to the MC
service server to create a pre-established session.
3\. MC service server performs necessary service control, obtains media
parameters (e.g. by means of interacting with a media distribution function of
the MC service server) and gathers ICE candidates.
4\. MC service server sends a create pre-establish session response to the MC
service client within the MC service UE.
5\. ICE candidate pair checks take place e.g. between the MC service client
within the MC service UE and a media distribution function of the MC service
server.
6\. If necessary the MC service client within the MC service UE sends a modify
pre-established session request to the MC service server to update the ICE
candidate pair for the pre-established session.
7\. The MC service server sends a modify pre-established session response
accepting the ICE candidate pair update.
The media sessions consist of at least an active media session carrying the
media and media control messages and an inactive media session for the media.
#### 10.3.2.3 Pre-established session modification
Figure 10.3.2.3-1 represents the pre-established session modification flow.
Figure 10.3.2.3-1: Pre-established session modification
1\. The MC service client within the MC service UE gathers ICE candidates, if
necessary (e.g. depending on the information that needs to be updated).
2\. The MC service client within the MC service UE sends a request to the MC
service server to modify a pre-established session.
3\. MC service server performs necessary service control, obtains any
necessary media parameters (e.g. by means of interacting with a media
distribution function of the MC service server) and gathers necessary ICE
candidates.
4\. MC service server sends a modify pre-establish session response to the MC
service client within the MC service UE.
5\. If necessary, ICE candidate pair checks take place e.g. between the MC
service client within the MC service UE and a media distribution function of
the MC service server.
6\. If necessary the MC service client within the MC service UE sends a modify
pre-established session request to the MC service server to update the ICE
candidate pair for the pre-established session.
7\. The MC service server sends a modify pre-established session response
accepting the ICE candidate pair update.
NOTE 1: The represented procedure corresponds to a session modification
initiated by the MC service client. It can also be initiated by the MC service
server.
NOTE 2: The procedure can also be used to switch a media session from the
inactive to the active state and the reverse. The modification of the session
triggers a corresponding modification of the characteristics (e.g. activity,
bandwidth) of the corresponding GBR bearers.
#### 10.3.2.4 Pre-established session release
Figure 10.3.2.4-1 represents the MC service client within the MC service UE
initiated pre-established session release flow and figure 10.3.2.4-2
represents the MC service server initiated pre-established session release
flow.

established session release
1\. The MC service client within the MC service UE sends a request to the MC
service server to release a pre-established session.
2\. The MC service server sends a release pre-establish session response to
the MC service client within the MC service UE.
3\. The MC service server releases all resources for the pre-established
session.

1\. The MC service server sends a request to the MC service client within the
MC service UE to release a pre-established session.
2\. The MC service client within the MC service UE sends a release pre-
establish session response to the MC service server.
3\. The MC service server releases all resources for the pre-established
session.
## 10.4 Simultaneous session (on-network)
### 10.4.1 General
A simultaneous session is functionality whereby the MC service client can
receive the media from multiple MC service calls/sessions over the same SIP
session and media bearer(s) between the MC service client and the MC service
server.
## 10.5 Use of UE-to-network relay
### 10.5.1 UE-to-network relay service authorization
The MC service shall support the capability for UE-to-network relay to
restrict the relayed group communication on a per group basis.
To meet the above requirement, ProSe (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]) can
be used with an appropriate relay service code as per the following:
\- To restrict connection from only the membership of allowed MC service
groups, UE-to-network relay UE is provisioned with relay service code(s)
associated with allowed MC service group(s). The UE-to-network relay performs
the access control as follows:
1) The UE broadcasts which MC service group(s) is/are authorized to connect to
the network over this UE-to-network relay by including the related relay
service code(s) in the UE-to-Network Relay Discovery Announcement message (as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]); or
2) The UE determines whether to respond to a remote UE\'s broadcasting message
by checking if the relay service code carried in the UE-to-Network Relay
Discovery Solicitation message is within the list of allowed relay service
codes.
\- To find a permitted UE-to-network relay, a remote UE is provisioned with
the relay service code(s) associated MC service group(s) which the MC service
user belongs to. The remote UE performs the UE-to-network relay selection as
follows:
1) The remote UE determines if it is allowed to connect to a particular UE-to-
network relay by checking whether the relay service code(s) associated with
its MC service group(s) is/are carried in UE-to-Network Relay Discovery
Announcement message (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]; or
2) The remote UE includes the relay service code(s) associated with its MC
service group(s) in Network Relay Discovery Solicitation message (as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]).
### 10.5.2 UE-to-network relay MC service
The ProSe UE-to-network relay provides a purely layer 3 IP data routing
service, when the remote UE loses the coverage of cellular network and the MC
service user on the remote UE requires to access the MC service via a ProSe
UE-to-network relay.
The application layer signalling for the MC service user on a remote UE are
identical to the application layer signalling for the MC service user on an
on-network UE.
## 10.6 General user authentication and authorization for MC services
### 10.6.1 Primary MC system
NOTE: Figure 10.6.1-1 is a high level user authentication and authorization
flow. 3GPP TS 33.180 [25] defines the specific user authentication and
authorization architecture required by the MC services in order to realize the
MC service user authentication and authorization requirements as defined in
3GPP TS 22.280 [3].
The user authentication process shown in figure 10.6.1-1 may take place in
some scenarios as a separate step independently from a SIP registration phase,
for example if the SIP core is outside the domain of the MC service server.
A procedure for user authentication is illustrated in figure 10.6.1-1. Other
alternatives may be possible, such as authenticating the user within the SIP
registration phase.
Figure 10.6.1-1: MC service user authentication and registration with Primary
MC system, single domain
1\. In this step the identity management client begins the user authorization
procedure. The MC service user supplies the user credentials (e.g. biometrics,
secureID, username/password) for verification with the identity management
server. This step may occur before or after step 3. In a MC system with
multiple MC services, a single user authentication as in step 1 can be used
for multiple MC service authorizations for the user.
2\. The signalling user agent establishes a secure connection to the SIP core
for the purpose of SIP level authentication and registration.
3\. The signalling user agent completes the SIP level registration with the
SIP core (and an optional third-party registration with the MC service
server(s)).
NOTE: The MC service client(s) perform the corresponding MC service
authorization for the user by utilizing the result of this procedure.
### 10.6.2 Interconnection partner MC system
Where communications with a partner MC system using interconnection are
required, user authorization takes place in the serving MC system of the MC
service user, using the MCX user service authorization procedure specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
### 10.6.3 Migration to partner MC system
#### 10.6.3.1 General
The following subclauses describe the procedure used for user authentication
and service authorization when migrating to a partner MC system.
To enable migration, the inter-domain MCX user service authorization
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25] are used.

#### 10.6.3.3 Procedures
##### 10.6.3.3.1 Migration service authorization procedure
The procedure for service authorization for migration to a partner MC system
and subsequent service authorization to migration partner MC system is shown
in figure 10.6.3.3.1-1.
Pre-conditions
\- The MC service user wishes to migrate to the partner MC system.
\- The MC service client has been configured with an MC service user profile
that contains the necessary parameters needed for connectivity with the
partner MC system.
\- A user authentication process has taken place which has supplied the
necessary credentials to the MC service client to permit service authorization
to take place in the partner MC system.
Figure 10.6.3.3.1-1: Service authorization for migration to partner MC system
and subsequent service authorization
1\. The MC service client requests migration service authorization with the
partner MC service server indicating the selected MC service user profile to
be used during migrated MC service. The MC service client provides both the MC
service ID provided during user authentication in the partner MC system, and
the MC service ID of the MC service user in the primary MC system of the MC
service user.
NOTE 1: The migrating MC service client also provides authentication
credentials which are specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
2\. The partner MC service server performs an initial authorization check to
verify that the MC service user is permitted to migrate to the partner MC
system from the primary MC system of the MC service user.
NOTE 2: The criteria for the initial authorization check is outside the scope
of the present document, but for example could be based on a pre-configured
list of users who are expected to request migrated service authorization.
3\. The partner MC service server identifies the primary MC system of the MC
service user of the MC service client by use of the MC service ID of the MC
service user in the primary MC system of the MC service user, which was
presented by the MC service client in step 1, and sends a migration service
authorization request to the gateway server in the partner MC system.
4\. The partner MC system gateway server identifies the primary MC system of
the MC service user from the MC service ID presented in step 3, and forwards
the migration service authorization request to the gateway server of the
primary MC system.
5\. The gateway server in the primary MC system of the MC service user
identifies the primary MC service server of the MC service user from the MC
service ID presented in step 3, and forwards the migration service
authorization request to that MC service server.
6\. The primary MC service server of the MC service user performs an
authorization check, to verify that migration is permitted to that partner MC
system by this MC service user using the indicated MC service user profile.
7\. The primary MC service server marks the MC service user as having
migrated, and records the partner MC system as the migrated MC system. The
primary MC service server also stores other necessary information related to
the migrated MC service user (e.g., MC service ID of the migrated MC service
user provided by the primary MC system mapped to the MC service ID of the
migrated MC service user provided by partner MC system).
8\. The primary MC service server sends a migration service authorization
response to the gateway server in the primary MC system.
9\. The gateway server in the primary MC system sends the migration service
authorization response to the gateway server in the partner MC system.
10\. The gateway server in the partner MC system sends the migration service
authorization response to the partner MC service server.
11\. The partner MC service server stores the necessary information related to
the migrated MC service user (e.g., MC service ID of the migrated MC service
user provided by the primary MC system mapped to the MC service ID of the
migrated MC service user provided by partner MC system). The migration status
of the MC service user allows proper communication redirection back to the
primary MC system once the migrated MC service user is no longer migrated on
this partner MC system.
NOTE 3: The stored necessary information both in the primary MC system and
partner MC system related to the migrated MC service user (e.g., MC service ID
of the migrated MC service user provided by the primary MC system mapped to
the MC service ID of the migrated MC service user provided by partner MC
system) is used for proper communication redirection only after successful
completion of MC service authorization at partner MC system (i.e. migrated MC
system).
12\. The partner MC service server sends the migration service authorization
response to the MC service client, confirming that successful migration and
service authorization has taken place.
NOTE 4: If topology hiding is not used, the migration service authorization
request and migration service authorization response messages are sent between
the MC service servers in the primary and partner MC system without the need
to be sent via an MC gateway server.
13\. The MC service user successfully completes the MC service authorization
with the MC service server within the partner MC system to which the MC
service user is migrating into.
14\. The partner MC service server of partner MC system notifies the primary
MC system of the MC service user of the MC service client by sending the MC
service authorization notification.

notification message is sent between the MC service servers in the primary and
partner MC system without the need to be sent via an MC gateway server.
3\. The partner MC system gateway server sends the migration service de-
authorization notification to the partner MC service server.
4\. The partner MC service server updates the stored necessary information
related to the was-migrated MC service user accordingly, (e.g., MC service
user's MC service ID provided by the primary MC system mapped to the MC
service ID provided by partner MC system).
NOTE 2: The period of how long MC system B will maintain the mapping
information is left for implementation.

## 10.7 Use of MBMS transmission
### 10.7.1 General
This subclause defines information flows and procedures for MBMS usage that
applies to MC services. MBMS bearers can be used by any MC service for any MC
service group. A single MBMS bearer can be used for one or more MC services
within a single group or by multiple group communications in parallel.
The following subclauses specify the procedures and information flows for the
usage of MBMS transmission that are utilised by the following MC services:
\- MCPTT (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]);
\- MCVideo (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]); and
\- MCData (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]).
MC service specific pre-requisites and resultant behaviour by functional
entities in performing these procedures are specified in the respective MC
service TSs as listed above.

### 10.7.3 Procedures for MBMS usage
#### 10.7.3.1 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
##### 10.7.3.1.1 General
In this scenario, the MC service server pre-establishes MBMS bearer(s) in
certain pre-configured areas before the initiation of the group communication
session. When a user originates a request for a group communication session
for one of these areas, the pre-established MBMS bearer(s) is used for the DL
media transmission.
The following steps needs to be performed prior the start of the MC group
communication session over pre-established MBMS bearer:
\- MBMS bearer(s) is Pre-established
\- Announce the pre-established MBMS bearer to the MC service clients
When these preparation steps have been done the MC group communication session
using MBMS bearer can start.
Both the media packets as well as the application level control signalling
(e.g. floor control messages) to the receiving MC service clients are sent on
the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be used for the
application level control messages, due to different bearer characteristic
requirements.
##### 10.7.3.1.2 Procedure
The procedure figure 10.7.3.1.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service
clients using an MBMS bearer. There might also be MC service clients in the
same MC group communication session that receive the communication on unicast
bearers.
Pre-conditions:
\- The participating users are already affiliated.
Figure 10.7.3.1.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
1a. The MC service server determines to activate MBMS bearer. The activation
of the MBMS bearer is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP
TS 23.468 [18]. This bearer will be used for the MC communication media.
1b. Optionally, the MC service server may also activate an MBMS bearer
dedicated for application level control signalling. The activation of the MBMS
bearer is done on MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the activation of MBMS bearers is
implementation specific.
2a. The MC service server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service
description associated with the pre-established MBMS bearer to the MC service
client. The MC service client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer,
from the service description.
2b. The MC service server may pass the MBMS bearer info for the service
description associated with the pre-established floor control MBMS bearer to
the MC service client. The MC service client obtains the TMGI, identifying the
MBMS bearer, from the service description.
NOTE 2: Step 2a and Step 2b can be done in one MBMS bearer announcement
message.
3\. The MC service client stores the information associated with the TMGI(s).
The MC service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information
to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the MC service UE.
4\. The MC service client that enters or is in the service area of at least
one announced TMGI indicates to the MC service server that the MC service
client is able to receive media over MBMS, whereby the MC service server may
decide to use the MBMS bearer instead of unicast bearer for MC communication
sessions.
NOTE 3: Step 4 is optional for the MC service UE on subsequent MBMS bearer
announcements.
5\. An MC service group communication session is established.
6\. As the MC service server transmits the media over the MBMS bearer, the
media packets are detected and delivered to the MC service client.
#### 10.7.3.2 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
In this scenario depicted in figure 10.7.3.2-1, the MC service server uses a
unicast bearer for communication with the UE on the DL at the start of the
group communication session. When the MC service server decides to use an MBMS
bearer for the DL media transmission, the MC service server establishes an
MBMS bearer using the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18]. The MC
service server provides MBMS service description information associated with
MBMS bearer(s), obtained from the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE starts using the
MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL media and stops using the unicast bearer for the
DL media transmission.
NOTE 1: The MC service server logic for determining when to establish the new
MBMS delivery bearer is implementation specific. For example, the MC service
server could decide to establish the MBMS delivery based on the location of
the UE\'s that are a part of the group communication session.
Figure 10.7.3.2-1: Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
1\. An MC service group communication session is established.
2\. The downlink data is sent by unicast delivery.
3\. The MC service server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468
[18]. Service description associated with the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from
the BM-SC.
4\. The MC service server provides service description information associated
with the MBMS bearer to the UE. The MC service UE obtains the TMGI from the
announcement message. This message may be sent on an application level control
signalling bearer.
5\. The MC service UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the
TMGI, while in the service area associated with the TMGI.
6\. The MC service UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS
associated with the TMGI.
7\. The MC service client notifies the MC service server the MBMS listening
status associated to the monitored TMGI, (e.g. that it is successfully
receiving the TMGI). The MC service client may also notify the MBMS reception
quality level of the TMGI. MC service server stops sending media data over
unicast way to the MC service client.
NOTE 2: The MBMS reception quality level may be used by the MC service server
to make an efficient decision to switch again to a unicast transmission or to
take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates
that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an
insufficient quality level for the reception of MC services).
8\. An MC service group communication session via dynamic MBMS bearer(s) is
established.
NOTE 3: Step 8 can occur before step 7.
9\. MC service server sends the downlink media for the group communication
session over the MBMS.
#### 10.7.3.3 Switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer
Figure 10.7.3.3-1 shows the procedure for service continuity when a UE is
about to move out of MBMS coverage by switching from MBMS bearer to unicast
bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that the MBMS bearer has been activated by MC service server
for downlink delivery.
Figure 10.7.3.3-1: Switching from MBMS delivery to unicast delivery
1\. The MC service UE detects that it suffers from bad MBMS bearer condition
for the corresponding MBMS service. The method to detect is implementation
specific.
2\. The MC service client notifies the MC service server that it suffers from
bad MBMS bearer condition for the corresponding MBMS service by sending the
MBMS listening status report.
NOTE 1: To efficiently notify the MC service server, e.g., when the MC service
client detects that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or
reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of MC services, the
MC service client proactively may send to the MC service server a MBMS
listening status report including the MBMS reception quality level.
3\. The MC service server sends the downlink data by unicast delivery to the
MC service client.
NOTE 2: The unicast bearer may be set up on demand after step 2 or before.
4\. During the switching, the MC service client simultaneously receives
downlink data through both unicast bearer and MBMS bearer. If there is no
downlink data to the MC service client, this step can be skipped.
5\. The MC service client ceases to receive the downlink data through MBMS
bearer but continues receiving data through unicast bearer.
#### 10.7.3.4 Use of MBMS bearer for application level control signalling
##### 10.7.3.4.1 Description
The MC service server may use an MBMS bearer for application level control
signalling, according to this subclause. An MBMS bearer for application level
control signalling is typically used for the purposes beyond the benefit for
using MBMS for resource efficiency, e.g. for improved MC service performance
(KPIs), handling of high load scenarios.
The MBMS bearer for application level control signalling may be used to
transmit the following messages:
> \- Transmission control (e.g. call setup and floor control)
>
> \- MBMS bearer announcement for media bearers
>
> \- Group application paging
>
> \- Group dynamic data (e.g. status of the group)
>
> \- Group state (e.g. emergency alerts)
An MBMS bearer for application level control signalling is activated in a
service area that is larger than the estimated service for media bearers. The
service area for the media bearers mainly based on counting of group members
in each defined service area. The MBMS bearer for application level control
signalling is also activated with a QoS that is better than MBMS media bearers
since the packet loss requirements are much stricter.
The MC service client shall not send responses to group-addressed application
level control signalling unless instructed or configured to respond.
##### 10.7.3.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 10.7.3.4.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MC
service clients using an MBMS bearer.
Figure 10.7.3.4.2-1: Use of MBMS bearer for application level control
signalling
1\. The MC service server determines to activate MBMS bearer for application
level control signalling, The activation of the MBMS bearer is done on the
MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
2\. The MC service server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service
description associated MBMS bearer to the MC service client. The MC service
client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service
description.
3\. The MC service client stores the information associated with the TMGI. The
MC service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to
activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the MC service UE.
4\. The MC service client that enters or is in the service area of the
announced TMGI indicates to the MC service server that the MC service client
is able to receive application level control messages over the MBMS bearer.
The MC service client may also indicate at which MBMS reception quality level
it has received the MC service media on the MBMS bearer. Hence, the MC service
server may decide to use the MBMS bearer for MC application control messages.
5\. The MC service server transmit MC application control messages
#### 10.7.3.5 MBMS bearer announcement over MBMS bearer
##### 10.7.3.5.1 Description
The MBMS announcement may be done on either a unicast bearer or a MBMS bearer.
Using a unicast bearer for MBMS bearer announcement provides an interactive
way of doing announcement. The MC service server will send the MBMS bearer
announcement message to the MC service client regardless if there is an MBMS
bearer active or the MC service client can receive the data on the MBMS bearer
with sufficient quality. The benefit of the existing procedure is that it
gives a secure way to inform the MC service client about the MBMS bearer and
how to retrieve the data on the MBMS bearer.
When there is more than one MBMS bearer active in the same service area for MC
service, there are not the same reasons to use unicast bearer for additional
MBMS bearer announcement. Instead a MBMS bearer for application level control
signalling can be used to announce additional MBMS bearers.
The MBMS bearer announcement messages are sent on an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages. This bearer will have a different QoS setting
compared to an MBMS bearer used for media, since application signalling
messages are more sensitive to packet loss.
##### 10.7.3.5.2 Procedure
The procedure defined below enables the MC service to announcement a new MBMS
bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- An MBMS bearer used for MC service application control messages must have
been pre-established and announced to the MC service client.
\- Additional MBMS bearer information may have already been announced to the
client.
Figure 10.7.3.5.2-1: MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages
1\. The MC service client monitors an MBMS bearer that is used for MC service
application signalling messages, such as bearer announcement messages.
2\. The MC service server activates a new MBMS bearer.
3\. The MC service server announce the MBMS bearer to the MC service client.
The bearer may have just been activated or may have already been running for
some time. The step may be repeated as needed.
4\. The MC service server sends a MBMS bearer announcement on the MBMS bearer
used for MC application control messages. The MBMS bearer announcement
contains the identity of the MBMS bearer (i.e. the TMGI) and may optionally
include additional information about the newly announced bearer. Required and
optional MBMS bearer announcement details may have already been provided. In
this case the MBMS bearer identity could be used as a key for such MBMS bearer
details.
5\. The MC service clients start to monitor the newly announced MBMS bearer.
6\. If requested by the MC service server, the MC service client sends an
acknowledgement of the MBMS bearer to the MC service server.
7\. The MC service server de-announce the MBMS bearer.
8\. The MC service server sends a MBMS bearer de-announcement message that
contains the identity of the MBMS bearer.
9\. The MC service client stops monitoring the de-announced MBMS bearer.
The same procedure can also be used to modify existing MBMS bearer
announcement information. Example of such modification could be addition of
UDP ports or modification of codec in the SDP.
#### 10.7.3.6 MBMS bearer quality detection
##### 10.7.3.6.1 Description
The MC service client and MC service server use this procedure to report and
take action on the MBMS bearer quality. An MC service client monitors an MBMS
bearer to receive MC service media. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio
level quality, transport level quality), the MC service client needs to inform
the MC service server that the MC service client is able to receive the MC
service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality or not able to
receive the MC service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality.
Furthermore, based on the received quality, the MC service client may notify
the MC service server at which MBMS reception quality level it has received
the MC service media on the MBMS bearer.
The issue can be more complex since the MC service client needs to estimate
the quality of the bearer even in the scenario when there are no data
currently transmitted on the MBMS bearer (e.g. between MCPTT group call). The
reason for this is that an MC service client that has entered an area with
significantly degraded MBMS quality, might not even notice that an MC service
communication is ongoing, meanwhile the MC server still assumes that the MC
service client can receive the media being broadcasted.
To estimate the MBMS bearer quality, for example as an equivalent BLER (Block
Error Rate), when no data is sent is implementation specific. This estimation
can be dependent on for example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and
measurements from the reference signals from the eNB(s). Other metrics (e.g.
RTP packet loss) may be used to estimate the MBMS bearer quality.
##### 10.7.3.6.2 Procedure
The MC service client shall indicate the ability of the MC service client to
receive the MBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- There is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is
announced to the MC service client
\- The MC service client is located in the MBMS broadcasting area
\- The MC service UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the
modulation and coding scheme
\- The MC service UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when
MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals
Figure 10.7.3.6.2-1: MBMS bearer quality detection
1\. The MC service client determines that the MBMS bearer quality shall be
reported to the MC service server. The MC service client may determine the
MBMS bearer quality by using the BLER of the received data. When no data is
received, the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the
modulation and coding scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to
estimate the expected MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to
proactively inform the MBMS service server of an expected loss of the MBMS
bearer quality. The MC service client may also map the determined MBMS bearer
quality to a MBMS reception quality level. The MBMS reception quality level
indicates at which specific MBMS bearer quality level the MC service media has
been received. Based on the MBMS reception quality level, the MC service
server may efficiently decide to switch to another bearer or to take measures
to prepare such a switch.
Editor\'s note: The set of MBMS reception quality levels and the mapping of
the determined MBMS bearer quality to those levels are FFS.
NOTE 1: When MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN reference signal needs to
be used and when SC-PTM is used the cell specific reference signal needs to be
used. With the measured reference signal, the reference signal received
quality (RSRQ) can be calculated.
2\. If the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the MC service
client sends an MBMS listening status report. The threshold is used to define
the MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer quality has been
acceptable or not to receive a specific MC service media. If the MBMS bearer
quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level, the MC service
client may send an MBMS listening status report including the MBMS reception
quality level.
NOTE 2: Prior sending the MBMS listening status report, it could be beneficial
to also include information for different alternatives e.g. another MBMS
bearer might have better quality and could be a better option than a transfer
of the communication to unicast.
NOTE 3: The threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on service
type (i.e. MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The metrics used
and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this specification.
3\. The MC service server may send additional proposal for measurements e.g.
information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS
bearer announcement message.
#### 10.7.3.7 Service continuity in MBMS scenarios
##### 10.7.3.7.1 General
This subclause specify service continuity scenario when MBMS bearers are used.
There are different solutions for different scenarios.
##### 10.7.3.7.2 Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another
The service continuity solution described in this subclause is suitable in the
scenario when multiple MBMS bearers are used with the purpose to cover a
larger area. In mission critical communication several media streams may be
multiplexed in one MBMS bearer. Furthermore, one media stream (e.g. MCPTT
group call) may be sent on more than one MBMS bearer if the receiving users
are distributed over more than one MBMS service area. An MC service client
that is interested in receiving a media stream that is broadcasted in both
MBMS bearers is a candidate for this service continuity procedure.
Figure 10.7.3.7.2-1 illustrates a deployment scenario that provides service
continuity between two MBSFN areas. Two different MBMS bearers are activated
(TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), the activation of the bearers is done in the two MBSFN
areas (MBSFN 1 and MBSFN 2). The MBSFN areas 1 and 2 are partially
overlapping, meaning that some transmitting cells belong to both MBSFN area 1
and MBSFN area 2.
Figure 10.7.3.7.2-1: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas
The procedural steps will work as follows:
Figure 10.7.3.7.2-2: Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another
1\. The UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1. No additional MBMS
bearers that the MC service client is interested in are active in the current
cell.
2\. The MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is
successfully receiving the MC service media over TMGI 1. The MC service client
may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 1.
NOTE 1: The MBMS reception quality level may be used by the MC service server
to make an efficient decision to switch to another MBMS bearer or to a unicast
bearer, or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality
level indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or
reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of MC services).
3\. The UE moves into a new cell in which both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are active.
This cell is part of both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2, and broadcast the
same service on both TMGIs.
4\. Location information are provided from the MC service UE via the Location
management client to the Location management server. For that, the MC service
UE uses the SAI information found in the system information block (SIB)
transmitted by the radio cells. The location management server provides the
location information to the MC service server.
NOTE 2: Whether the MC service server has subscribed for notifications, as
described in clause 10.9.3.6.1 of the present document, Event-trigger location
information notification procedure, or uses on-demand requests, as described
in clause 10.9.3.6.2 of the present document, On-demand usage of location
information procedure, is out of scope.
5\. The MC service server sends to the MC service client a MBMS bearer
announcement with information related to TMGI 2 (if the MC service server had
not done it before). Hence, the MC service client knows that TMGI 2 transmits
the same MC service media.
6\. The MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is
successfully receiving TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The MC service client may also
notify the MBMS reception quality level per TMGI.
7\. The MC service client may receive the MC service media over both MBMS
bearers, i.e. TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The MC service client may also verify that it
is the same content sent on both bearers. The duplicated packets may also be
used to perform error corrections.
8\. The UE moves into a new cell in MBSFN area 2, where only TMGI 2 is active.
9\. The MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is
successfully receiving the MC service media over TMGI 2. The MC service client
may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 2.
10\. The MC service client receives the MC service media only over TMGI 2.
This service continuity procedure mitigates the risk of packet loss that may
occur if the UE would request to transfer the media stream to a unicast bearer
when moving into the new area and then back to a multicast bearer when the UE
can listen to TMGI 2. However, it is still required that the MC service client
sends a location report (and MBMS listening report), as described in steps 4-6
above. To send the location report and the MBMS listening report by the MC
service client to the MC service server a unicast bearer is needed. The
location report from the MC service client is required, since the MC service
server must know that the UE has entered a new area and can only listen to
MBMS bearer active in that area. If this is not done the MC service server
might send a media stream that the MC service client is required to listen to
on the MBMS bearer 1, since the MC service server still assumes that the UE is
located in the MBSFN area 1.
The solution can be improved as illustrated in figure 10.7.3.7.2-3. In this
case two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), these MBMS
bearers are used only for media. An application level signalling bearer is
activated (TMGI 9), in both MBSFN areas. This bearer is used for floor control
messages and other application level signalling messages that are sent on the
MBMS bearer TMGI 9. A similar concept was already introduced in 3GPP TS 23.179
[7] subclause 10.10.2, where the procedure allowed a separate MBMS bearer for
floor control signalling. The application level signalling bearer will be used
for all control messages needed for both media MBMS bearer (TMGI 1 and TMGI2).
By using an application level signalling bearer (e.g. TMGI 9) the MC service
clients can receive floor control messages for all calls going on in the areas
of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. A MC service client that is located in the area of
TMGI 2 and is interested in a MCPTT group call transmission only going on in
TMGI 1, can with the information received in TMGI 9 initiate a unicast bearer
and request to receive that specific call over a unicast instead. Without the
information received over TMGI 9 the MC service client must immediately report
that the MC service client has left the broadcast area that the MC service
server assumes that the MC service client is located in. With the use of TMGI
9 there is no immediate need for the MC service client to inform the MC
service server of a location change.
Figure 10.7.3.7.2-3: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas with a
separate MC application signalling bearer
The procedural steps in this scenario will be the same as described above in
this subclause. However, in this scenario the MC service client is not
required to initiate a unicast bearer to send location report (or MBMS
listening report). The UE may move between the two MBMS bearers (TMGI 1 and
TMGI 2) without the need to report an area change. A condition for this to
work is that there is an application level signalling bearer (TMGI 9)
activated in the full area (i.e. the area of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2). The TMGI
9 will broadcast all floor control messages for all calls ongoing in both
areas. If the UE is in coverage of one of the two MBMS bearers that does not
transmit the media of interest the UE can report to the server that it is not
able to listen to the media over the MBMS bearer, which triggers the server to
use a unicast bearer instead.
##### 10.7.3.7.3 Service continuity with a UE-to-Network relay
This procedure handles a scenario when UE is moving from a location when the
UE is experiencing good reception of the MBMS bearer to a location outside the
MBMS service coverage. The MC service client apply a service continuity
procedure to ensure that the service can be maintained and that the packet
loss can be minimized during transition to a UE-to-Network relay connection.
The solution also provides the benefit that it offloads the cell when UEs that
normally would trigger a transfer from MBMS bearers to unicast bearers when
moving outside the MBMS coverage area.
Figure 10.7.3.7.3-1 below illustrates the concept of this procedure. In the
figure UE A (with the MC service client) is first within the MBMS coverage
(the far right most location). The MBMS coverage is represented by the dashed
circle. The UE A is the moving outside the MBMS coverage and first enters a
location in which the MBMS signal is not good enough, but in this location
there is still coverage to use unicast bearers. Unicast bearers use link
adaption and retransmission so the coverage area for unicast bearers is larger
than the coverage of the MBMS bearers. The solid circle outer line represents
the coverage of the unicast bearer.
A UE that is leaving the area of MBMS coverage may in this scenario trigger a
ProSe discovery procedure to initiate the establishment a relay communication
path to UE-R. A UE that is receiving media over an MBMS bearer (and is in idle
mode) and for the moment does not need a unicast bearer is costly (from a
resource efficiency point of view) to transfer to a unicast bearer due to the
need for retransmissions and robust coding in the outer part of cell.
When the ProSe communication path is established the UE A may continue to
receive the media over the relay UE-R.
Figure 10.7.3.7.3-1: UE A is moving from a position in MBMS coverage to
outside the network coverage passing an area where only unicast is possible
The procedure defined in this subclause allows for MBMS bearer service
continuity when UE is moving from a MBMS coverage area to outside the MBMS
coverage area. The procedure applies when the UE is not finding a target cell
with good RSRP/RSRQ (receiving strong reference signals from other cells),
which could trigger normal cell reselection procedure. In such scenario other
aspects should be evaluated to trigger to a relay communication path.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service client UE is not using a unicast bearer when this procedure
applies.
Figure 10.7.3.7.3-2: Service continuity over MBMS bearer using UE-to-network
relay
1\. The MC service client estimate the MBMS bearer quality. The MC service
clients also measure the reference signals from other cells to estimate the
possibilities to transfer to unicast and perform a cell reselection procedure.
2\. If the MBMS bearer quality has reach a certain threshold the MC service
client performs ProSe UE-to-network relay discovery over PC5 and establishes a
secure point-to-point link with the relay (UE-R) over PC5. As part of this
process the remote UE is mutually authenticated at PC5 layer with either the
relay or with the network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].
3\. Normal service continuity procedure for a UE-to-network relay. This may be
done according to annex B.
4\. The MC service client informs the UE-R about the reception of media over
the MBMS bearer. This includes sending the TMGIs, MBMS SAIs and ProSe per
packet priority to the UE-R. This procedure is specified in 3GPP TS 23.303
[14].
5\. The UE-R will relay the MBMS media using one-to-many ProSe Direct
Communication. The UE-R may also relay requests to transfer the media flow
from multicast to unicast and vice versa.
#### 10.7.3.8 MBMS suspension notification
##### 10.7.3.8.1 Description
In this procedure the MC service client is requested by the MC service server
to send a MBMS suspension report. This request for MBMS suspension report can
be included in the MBMS bearer announcement and the MC service server may
choose to only send this request for MBMS suspension report to a subset of all
MC service clients.
##### 10.7.3.8.2 Procedure
The information flow below defines a procedure in which the MC service client
notifies the MC service server about an MBMS suspension decision in RAN.
The MC service server can decide on a subset of all UEs in the MBMS broadcast
area that shall report on MBMS bearer suspension. When the MC service server
make the decision of the UE subset, consideration shall be taken to the
location of the UEs, since UEs location is dynamically changed. This means
that the MBMS suspension reporting instruction may need to be updated
regularly based on the UEs mobility.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that there is at least one active MBMS bearer
Figure 10.7.3.8.2-1: MBMS suspension notification from MC service client
1\. The MC service server sends an MBMS suspension reporting instruction to
the MC service client.
NOTE: This message may be included in the MBMS bearer announcement message and
may be sent both on a unicast bearer and a multicast bearer.
2\. RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures
in 3GPP TS 36.300 [21].
3\. An MBMS suspension indication is sent in the MSI (MCH Scheduling
Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [21].
4\. The MC service client detect the MBMS suspension and sends an MBMS
suspension report.
MC service client that is not instructed to send an MBMS suspension report
shall still detect the MBMS suspension indication from RAN (step 3). An MC
service client shall in this case not send other types of report (e.g. MBMS
listening reports).
The same procedure can be applied at MBMS resumption or other MBMS events that
may be detected by the MC service client.
#### 10.7.3.9 Multi-server bearer coordination
##### 10.7.3.9.1 General
To avoid allocating duplicate bearers for an MBMS service area, a single MC
service server may manage all the MBMS media transmission for all groups and
users within a particular MBMS service area. An MC service server controlling
the MBMS bearer has the MBMS bearer control role. Different MC service servers
may allocate bearers as needed and make them available for other MC service
servers to use. The use of the procedure in this sub clause is optional. MC
system that supports multi-server bearer coordination shall use this
procedure.
NOTE: Within one group communication session, multiple MC service servers
(participating role) might be involved. Multiple MBMS service areas might have
sufficient MC service group members to warrant multiple MBMS bearers to be
used and therefore multiple MC service servers (MBMS bearer control role)
might be involved. For brevity, this clause only illustrates the simplest
case.
##### 10.7.3.9.2 Procedures
###### 10.7.3.9.2.1 MBMS bearer coordination independent on broadcasted media
The procedure in this sub clause may be used when two or more MC service
servers are serving users in the same area and are configured to share MBMS
bearers for that specific area. The MC service servers may be of the same kind
or different kind. The MC service servers are not participating in the same
group call, which means that each MC service server broadcast media
independently of each other.
Pre-conditions:
\- All MC service servers are configured with the contact information of those
MC service servers that are configured to take the MBMS bearer control role.
Figure 10.7.3.9.2.1-1: Multiple server MBMS procedure
1\. The MC service server 1 evaluates whether multicast is desired for each
service area in which MC service group members are located, based upon the
locations, affiliation status and other factors.
2\. The MC service server 1 determines whether another MC service server has
already established a bearer with coverage for the MBMS service area where
multicast is desired. To do this, the MC service server 1 consults a pre-
configured list of MC service servers and sends them a discover bearer
request. This request may be sent to several MC service servers.
NOTE: MC service servers of the same type can be configured to discover
bearers from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized
entity for MBMS bearer control for the MC service. Similarly, all MC service
servers of all types can be configured to discover bearers from a single
server. The single server then becomes a centralized MBMS bearer controller
for all MC services.
3\. The MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) responds with a
discover bearer response indicating whether there is an MBMS bearer available
in the specific MBMS service area with the requested bandwidth. The discover
bearer response message includes the TMGI of the bearer that is shared between
the MC service servers. If the bearer of interest has insufficient bandwidth,
the polling MC service server 1 may resort to unicast, or may allocate another
bearer for the congested area. If a duplicate bearer is allocated for the same
area, the bearer should not be shared with other servers and may be torn down
as soon as the congestion on the original bearer clears up, in order to
conserve resources.
For any MBMS service areas not covered by another MC service server, the MC
service server 1 prepares to distribute media to those MBMS service areas via
multicast by setting up a bearer. The bearer set up by the MC service server 1
may then become available for other MC service servers (controlling role) for
other MC service groups.
4\. The MC service server 1 performs the MBMS bearer announcement and the MBMS
listening reporting according relevant procedures specified in this
specification. If the MC service server 2 is authorized to receive MBMS
related location information from the users utilizing the services from MC
service server 1, the MC service server 2 may optionally do the MBMS bearer
announcement and handling the listening reports on behalf of MC service server
1. Listening reports shall in this case be sent to both MC service server 1
and MC service server 2.
5\. The MC service server 1 sends a media distribution request to the MC
service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role). The media distribution request is
sent to reserve the specified capacity in the MBMS bearer.
6\. MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) sends a media distribution
response to the MC service server 1 indicating whether the request can be
supported and supplies details about the bearer.
7\. The MC service server 1 establishes a group communication session via the
bearer, informing MBMS connected MC service clients 1 and 2 that a group
communication session is about to start on the MBMS bearer. This step is
equivalent to MapGroupToBearer in MCPTT.
8\. MC service client 2 sends media on the uplink to the MC service server 1
9\. The MC service server 1 forwards the media to MC service server 2 (MBMS
bearer control role).
10\. The MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) distributes the media
to MBMS served MC service client 1 via multicast.
11\. The MC service server 1 sends a media distribution release request,
informing the MC service server 2 (MBMB bearer control role) to request the MC
service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) to release the capacity that was
reserved in step 5.
12\. The MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) respond to the request
by sending a media distribution release request.
###### 10.7.3.9.2.2 MBMS bearer coordination within one group call
The procedure in this sub clause may be used when two MC service servers are
serving users in the same area and are configured to share MBMS bearers for
that specific area. The MC service servers are of the same kind, and the MC
service servers may participate in the same group call, and by that have a
need to broadcast the same content.
Pre-conditions:
\- All MC service servers are configured with the contact information of those
MC service servers that are configured to take the MBMS bearer control role.
Figure 10.7.3.9.2.2-1: Multiple server MBMS procedure
1\. The MC service server 1 evaluates whether multicast is desired for each
service area in which MC service group members are located, based upon the
locations, affiliation status and other factors.
2\. The MC service server 1 determines whether another MC service server has
already established a bearer with coverage for the MBMS service area where
multicast is desired. To do this, the MC service server 1 consults a pre-
configured list of MC service servers and sends them a discover bearer
request. This request may be sent to several MC service servers.
NOTE 1: MC service servers of the same type can be configured to discover
bearers from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized
entity for MBMS bearer control for the MC service. Similarly, all MC service
servers of all types can be configured to discover bearers from a single
server. The single server then becomes a centralized MBMS bearer controller
for all MC services.
3\. The MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) responds with a
discover bearer response indicating whether there is an MBMS bearer available
in the specific MBMS service area with the requested bandwidth. The discover
bearer response message includes the TMGI of the bearer that is shared between
the MC service servers. If the bearer of interest has insufficient bandwidth,
the polling MC service server 1 may resort to unicast, or may allocate another
bearer for the congested area. If a duplicate bearer is allocated for the same
area, the bearer should not be shared with other servers and may be torn down
as soon as the congestion on the original bearer clears up, in order to
conserve resources.
For any MBMS service areas not covered by another MC service server, the MC
service server 1 prepares to distribute media to those MBMS service areas via
multicast by setting up a bearer. The bearer set up by the MC service server 1
may then become available for other MC service servers (controlling role) for
other MC service groups.
4\. The MC service server 1 performs the MBMS bearer announcement and the MBMS
listening reporting according relevant procedures specified in this
specification. If the MC service server 2 is authorized to receive MBMS
related location information from the users utilizing the services from MC
service server 1, the MC service server 2 may optionally do the MBMS bearer
announcement and handling the listening reports on behalf of MC service server
1. Listening reports shall in this case be sent to both MC service server 1
and MC service server 2.
NOTE 2: Step 1-4 is also performed by MC service server 3, but is not shown in
the procedure to make it easier to read.
5\. The MC service client 2 initiate a group call that is subject for
multicast transmission. In this scenario there are more than one MC service
server (i.e. MC service server 1 and MC service server 3) that serves MC
service clients that are affiliated to the group, and by that should receive
the media in the group call.
6a. The MC service server 1 sends a media distribution request to the MC
service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role). The media distribution request
includes the MC group identifier. This indicates that the media distribution
request is used for this specific group call.
6b. The MC service server 3 sends a media distribution request to the MC
service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role). The media distribution request
includes the MC group identifier. This indicates that the media distribution
request is used for this specific group call.
7a. The MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) sends a media
distribution response to the MC service server 1 indicating whether the
request can be supported and supplies details about the bearer. This also
includes details on which media stream that should be used for broadcasting
the media on the MBMS bearer. This information is used in the MapGroupToBearer
message sent by the MC service server when setting up the group call.
7b. The MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) sends a media
distribution response to the MC service server 3 indicating that the group
call is already transmitted on the MBMS bearer by another MC service server.
Based on the information, the MC service server 3 could decide to not
broadcast media if media is already being broadcasted.
8a. The media is sent from the MC service client 2 to MC service server 1,
which is the participating server for the MC service group of the group call.
8b. The media is forwarded to all MC service servers that are serving users
that takes part in the group call.
NOTE 3: The figure above does not visualize the participating server for the
MC service group and controlling server for the MC service group. The media is
sent to all participating servers for the MC service group which are the
servers that decide on unicast or multicast transmission.
9\. The MC service server 1 forwards the media to MC service server 2 (MBMS
bearer control role).
10\. The MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) distributes the media
to MBMS served MC service client 1 via multicast.
11\. The MC service server 1 sends a media distribution release request,
informing the MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) to request the MC
service server 2 (MBMS bearer control role) to release the capacity that was
reserved in step 5. The media distribution release request shall only be sent
when the group call is terminated. 12. The MC service server 2 (MBMS bearer
control role) respond to the request by sending a media distribution release
request.
#### 10.7.3.10 MBMS bearer event notification
##### 10.7.3.10.1 General
The MC service server is an instantiation of a GCS AS. For the MC service
server to know the status of the MBMS bearer, and thus know the networks
ability to deliver the service, it is required that the network provides MBMS
bearer event notifications to the MC service server. The different events
notified to the MC service server include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g.
when the first cell successfully allocated MBMS resources), including
information if any cells fail to allocate MBMS resources to a specific MBMS
bearer, the current status of the MBMS bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume
or overload scenarios.
Editor\'s note: The procedure defined in this sub clause requires an
enhancement to GCSE and RAN and is therefore subject to implementation in EPC
and RAN.
##### 10.7.3.10.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 10.7.3.10.2-1 shows notification information flows
from MC service server to BM-SC.
Figure 10.7.3.10.2-1: MBMS bearer event notification
1\. The MC service server activates an MBMS bearer. The activation of the MBMS
bearer is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468
[18].
2\. The BMSC will respond to the activation with an Activate MBMS bearer
response message, according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
3\. The EPC and RAN will initiate the MBMS session start procedure according
to 3GPP TS 23.246 [11]. This procedure is outside the scope of this
specification.
4\. At the first indication of a successful MBMS session start procedure, the
BM-SC sends a MBMS bearer event notification, indicating that the MBMS bearer
is ready to use.
5\. The MC service server starts to use the MBMS bearer according to the MBMS
procedures in this specification.
6\. An event from RAN related to the MBMS session is received by the BM-SC.
7\. The BM-SC notifies the MC service server of certain MBMS related events
including references to affected MBMS services areas or list of cells. Example
of such events may be radio resources not available, overload, MBMS
suspension.
8\. The MC service server may decide, based on the received events, to switch
to unicast transmission for relevant MC service clients.
NOTE: Steps 6-8 should be seen as example events from the network that may
occur and possible actions taken by the MC service server. These steps may be
done at any time and repeatedly during the life time of an MBMS bearer.
#### 10.7.3.11 Use of FEC to protect MBMS transmissions
##### 10.7.3.11.1 General
Application layer FEC can be used to recover the packet losses when delivering
a MC service over MBMS, to reach its required level of QoS.
Support of FEC is optional for the MC service servers and MC service clients
Adding FEC introduces an extra latency in the end to end media transport. This
extra latency is bounded to fulfil the low latency requirements for mission
critical services.
FEC can be applied by the BM-SC if required by the MC service server
(subclause 10.7.3.11.2), or directly by the MC service server (subclause
10.7.3.11.3). FEC is decoded by the MC service client. Either method is
independent of the other.
The MC service server may consider the listening status reports from previous
MBMS bearer quality detection procedures (subclause 10.7.3.6) to adjust the
FEC parameters when delivering over a new MBMS bearer.
##### 10.7.3.11.2 FEC encoding by the BM-SC
In this procedure, depicted in figure 10.7.3.11.2-1, the MC service server
asks the BM-SC to apply FEC to a set of medias, transported by a MBMS bearer,
using the Setup FEC request.
This procedure can be applied when using pre-established MBMS bearers
(10.7.3.1) or dynamic MBMS bearers (10.7.3.2).
Pre-condition:
1\. The MC service server has already activated a MBMS Bearer, with the MBMS
Bearer request specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
Figure 10.7.3.11.2-1: Application of FEC by the BM-SC
1\. The MC service server decides to set up FEC for a set of MC service media
flows. The request is done on the MB2-C reference point. It includes the
following elements: the TMGI of the bearer transporting those media, the media
descriptions (codecs, transport protocols, bitrates, destination ip addresses
and ports), the identification of the FEC repair packet flow (IP destination
and port), an upper bound to the additional latency resulting to FEC
application. The MC Service server may perform this request several times to
protect separately different sets of media transported within the same MBMS
bearer.
2\. If the BM-SC can satisfy the request, the Setup FEC response includes a
modified list of media information and FEC information. The response also
includes an identifier to the FEC process instance, which can be used to
release the application of FEC for these media flows.
NOTE 1: Source media packets may be modified by the application of FEC (e.g.
addition of a footer of header), leading to a modification of the delivery
protocol to be announced within the media information.
NOTE 2: The Release FEC request is not shown on the figure.
3\. The MC service server announces the MBMS bearer to the MC service client
with the MBMS bearer announcement procedure, including the modified list of
medias information and FEC information within the SDP information.
4\. When the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow
for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message
identifying the MC service media flow and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer, such as
the MapGroupToBearer message for MCPTT, specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], or
the MapGroupToBearer message for MCVideo, specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [12].
5\. The MC service server sends the downlink media to the BM-SC on the MB2-U
reference points and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
6\. The BM-SC performs FEC encoding of the downlink media in accordance to the
announced FEC algorithm and parameters and delivers it over MBMS.
7\. The MC service client performs FEC decoding of the encoded media flows in
accordance to the announced FEC information and delivers the decoded flows to
the media player.
Editor\'s note: the need for a MC service server ability to turn off/on the
production of repair packets on the BM-SC during the media transmission must
be discussed, and may impact the procedure.
##### 10.7.3.11.3 FEC encoding by the MC service server
In this procedure, depicted in figure 10.7.3.11.3-1, FEC encoding is performed
by the MC service server. The MC service server includes the FEC information
within the MBMS bearer announcement. The FEC decoding is performed by the MC
service client.
Figure 10.7.3.11.3-1: Application of FEC by the MC service server
1\. The MC service server sends MBMS bearer announcement message with FEC
information to the MC service clients.
2\. As media packets arrive from the originating MC service UE (not shown in
diagram), the media is processed by the media distribution function on the MC
service server.
3\. The MC service server performs FEC encoding and processing in accordance
with the selected FEC algorithm.
4\. The MC service server sends the media with FEC to the MC service client
(both payload source packets and the FEC repair packets are sent on the MB2-U
to the BM-SC, which transparently forwards them unmodified to the MC service
client).
5\. MC service client performs FEC decoding and processing in accordance with
the selected FEC algorithm
#### 10.7.3.12 Header compression over MBMS with ROHC
##### 10.7.3.12.1 General
Support of ROHC over MBMS is optional for the MC service servers and MC
service clients. If header compression and FEC are both applied to a
communication over MBMS, the header compression shall be performed after the
FEC encoding.
These procedures can be applied when using pre-established MBMS bearers (see
clause 10.7.3.1) or dynamic MBMS bearers (see clause 10.7.3.2).
##### 10.7.3.12.2 Header compression by the MC service server
In this procedure, depicted in figure 10.7.3.12.2-1, header compression is
performed by the MC service server. The MC service server includes the ROHC
information within the MBMS bearer announcement. The header decompression is
performed by the MC service client.
Figure 10.7.3.12.2-1: Header compression by the MC service server
1\. The MC service server sends MBMS bearer announcement message with ROHC
information to the MC service clients. The ROHC information contains the list
of ROHC profiles and the ROHC context identifier range).
2\. When the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow
for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message
identifying the MC service media flow and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer, such as
the MapGroupToBearer message for MCPTT, specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], or
the MapGroupToBearer message for MCVideo, specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12].
3\. As media packets arrive from the originating MC service UE (not shown in
diagram), the media is processed by the media distribution function on the MC
service server.
4\. The MC service server performs header compression in accordance with the
ROHC information.
5\. The MC service server sends the header compressed media to the MC service
client
6\. The MC service client performs header decompression in accordance to the
ROHC information
##### 10.7.3.12.3 Header compression by the BM-SC
In this procedure, depicted in figure 10.7.3.12.3-1, the MC service server
asks the BM-SC to compress headers for a set of medias, transported by a MBMS
bearer, using the Setup ROHC request.
Pre-condition:
1\. The MC service server has already activated a MBMS Bearer, with the MBMS
Bearer request specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
Figure 10.7.3.12.3-1: Header compression by the BM-SC
1\. The MC service server decides to set up ROHC within a MBMS bearer. The
request is done on the MB2-C reference point. It includes the following
elements: the ROHC configuration, the list of RTP and UDP flows to be header
compressed, characterized by their destination IPs and port numbers. For each
of these flows, the request may indicate a target periodicity for the full
header packets.
NOTE 1: The MC service server can later modify the ROHC configuration by
performing again the Setup ROHC request.
NOTE 2: The Release ROHC request is also not shown on the figure.
2\. If the BM-SC can satisfy the request, the Setup ROHC response confirm the
application of header compression.
3\. The MC service server announces the MBMS bearer to the MC service client
with the MBMS bearer announcement procedure, including the ROHC information.
4\. When the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow
for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message
identifying the MC service media flow and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer, such as
the MapGroupToBearer message for MCPTT, specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], or
the MapGroupToBearer message for MCVideo, specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12].
5\. The MC service server sends the downlink media to the BM-SC on the MB2-U
reference points and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
6\. The BM-SC compresses headers of the downlink media in accordance to the
announced ROHC parameters and delivers it over MBMS.
7\. The MC service client performs header decompression in accordance to the
ROHC information.
#### 10.7.3.13 Use of MBMS bearer for group status
The MC service server, e.g., MCPTT server, may use the MBMS bearer to inform
the status of a group communication (indicating the group call is on-going or
not) when the group call is set up on unicast bearers. The affiliated clients
that will perform late entry chat group calls or rejoin calls may use this
group status information to decide whether to join the calls. The information
flows for group status notification are specified in subclause 10.7.2.12.
NOTE: The procedure described in clause 10.7.3.4 can be used for the
transmission of the group status notification.
## 10.8 Affiliation and de-affiliation to/from MC service group(s)

### 10.8.3 Affiliation
#### 10.8.3.1 MC service group affiliation procedure
Procedure for affiliation to MC service group(s) for a single MC service is
described in figure 10.8.3.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client has already been provisioned (statically or dynamically)
with the group information, or a pointer to the group information, that the MC
service client is allowed to be affiliated;
2\. MC service server may have retrieved the user profile and group policy
from the group configuration e.g. which user(s) are authorized to affiliate to
what MC service group(s), priority, and other configuration data;
3\. MC service client may have indicated to the group management server that
it wishes to receive updates of group configuration data for MC service
groups(s) for which it is authorized (as described in subclause 10.1.5.3);
4\. The MC service client triggers the affiliation procedure. This is an
explicit affiliation caused either by the MC service user or determined by a
trigger event such as the MC service UE coming within a permitted geographic
operational area of an MC service group; and
5\. The group management server has subscribed to the MC service server within
the MC system where the group is defined for affiliation status updates.
Figure 10.8.3.1-1: MC service group affiliation procedure
1\. MC service client of the MC service user requests the MC service server to
affiliate to an MC service group or a set of MC service groups.
2a. MC service server checks if the group policy is locally cached. If the
group policy is not locally cached on the MC service server then MC service
server requests the group policy from the group configuration from the group
management server.
2b. MC service server receives the group policy from the group configuration
from the group management server.
3\. Based on the group policy from the group configuration and user profile,
the MC service server checks if the MC service group(s) is enabled and if the
MC service client is authorised to affiliate to the requested MC service
group(s). The MC service server also performs the check for the maximum limit
of the total number (N2) of MC service groups that the user can be affiliated
to simultaneously.
4\. If the user of the MC service client is authorised to affiliate to the
requested MC service group(s) then the MC service server stores the
affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service group(s).
5\. MC service server confirms to the MC service client the affiliation (5a)
and updates the group management server with the affiliation status of the
user for the requested MC service group(s) (5b).
NOTE: Steps 5a and 5b can occur in any order or in parallel.
#### 10.8.3.2 Affiliation to MC service group(s) defined in partner MC system
without topology hiding
##### 10.8.3.2.1 Functional description
When an MC service client wants to affiliate to MC service group(s) which is
defined in a partner MC system for a single MC service and where topology
hiding is not required, it shall be subject to authorization from the partner
MC system where the MC service group(s) is defined, and whether it subjects to
authorization from the primary MC system is conditional.
##### 10.8.3.2.2 Procedure
The procedure for affiliation to MC service group(s) which is defined in a
partner MC system where topology hiding is not required for a single MC
service is described in figure 10.8.3.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client has already been provisioned (statically or
dynamically) with the group information, or a pointer to the group
information, that the MC service client is allowed to be affiliated;
2\. The MC service server of the primary MC system may have locally cached the
MC service group affiliation status of the MC service user;
3\. The MC service server of the partner MC system may have retrieved the
group related information from the group management server;
4\. The MC service client may have indicated to the group management server of
the partner MC system that it wishes to receive updates of group configuration
data for MC service group(s) for which it is authorized (as described in
subclause 10.1.5.3);
5\. The MC service user triggers the affiliation procedure. This is an
explicit affiliation caused by the MC service user; and
6\. The group management server has subscribed to the MC service server within
the MC system where the group is defined for affiliation status updates.
Figure 10.8.3.2.2-1: Affiliation for an MC service group defined in partner MC
system where topology hiding is not required
1\. The MC service client requests the MC service server of the primary MC
system to affiliate to an MC service group or a set of MC service groups.
2\. The MC service server of the primary MC system checks if the MC service
client is authorized to affiliate to the requested MC service group(s) based
on the user profile. The MC service server also performs the check for the
maximum limit of the total number (N2) of MC service groups that the user can
be affiliated to simultaneously.
3\. Based on the group information included in the request, the MC service
server of the primary MC system, it determines to send group affiliation
request to the corresponding MC service server of the partner MC system. The
request may be routed through intermediate signalling nodes.
4a. The MC service server of the partner MC system checks if the group policy
is locally cached. If the group policy is not locally cached on the MC service
server then MC service server subscribes to the group policy from the group
configuration from the group management server.
4b. The MC service server of the partner MC system receives the group policy
from the group configuration from the group management server via notification
and locally caches the group policy from the group configuration.
5\. Based on the group policy, the MC service server of the partner MC system
checks if the MC service group(s) is not disabled and if the user of the MC
service client is authorised to affiliate to the requested MC service
group(s).
6\. If the user of the MC service client is authorised to affiliate to the
requested MC service group(s) then the MC service server of the partner MC
system stores the affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service
group(s).
7\. The MC service server of the partner MC system sends the affiliation
status result of requested MC service group(s) to the MC service server of the
primary MC system (7a) and updates the group management server with the
affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service group(s) (7b).
NOTE: Steps 7a and 7b can occur in any order or in parallel.
8\. The MC service server of the primary MC system stores the affiliation
status of the user for the requested MC service group(s).
9\. The MC service server of the primary MC system sends the group affiliation
status result for the requested MC service group(s) to the MC service client.

using topology hiding
##### 10.8.3.2a.1 Functional description
When an MC service client wants to affiliate to MC service group(s) which is
defined in a partner MC system for a single MC service using topology hiding,
it shall be subject to authorization from the partner MC system where the MC
service group(s) is defined, and may also be subject to authorization from the
serving MC system of the MC service client.
##### 10.8.3.2a.2 Procedure
Figure 10.8.3.2a.2-1 illustrates the group affiliation procedure to an MC
service group defined in the partner MC system of the serving MC system of the
MC service user, where topology hiding procedures are required.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the MC system gateway servers shown in this
procedure are roles of an MC service server or separate entities.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client 1 is service authorized within its serving MC system.
2\. The group host MC service server of the MC service group to which the MC
service user of MC service client 1 wishes to affiliate is located in the
partner MC system of the serving MC system of MC service client 1
3\. Topology hiding is required by both MC systems
4\. The serving MC system of MC service client 1 and the group home MC system
are configured to allow topology hiding to take place.
Figure 10.8.3.2a.2-1: Group affiliation to an MCservice group defined in
partner MC system using topology hiding
1\. MC service client 1 initiates an MC service group affiliation request to
the serving MC service server of MC service client 1 on behalf of its MC
service user.
2\. The MC service server of the serving MC system checks that the MC service
client 1 is authorized to affiliate to the requested MC service group based on
the user profile, and that the maximum number of MC service groups that the
user can be affiliated to (N2) has not been exceeded.
3\. The MC service server determines the group host MC service server of the
MC service group. The MC service group is identified to have a different group
home MC system, and if topology hiding is required by the serving MC system of
MC service client 1, the serving MC system gateway server is determined to act
as proxy group host MC service server for the MC service group.
4\. The MC service server of the serving MC system forwards the MC service
group affiliation request to the gateway server of the serving MC system.
NOTE 1: If the serving MC system of MC service client 1 does not require
topology hiding, the serving MC service server of MC service client 1 is able
to send the MC service group affiliation request directly to the gateway
server of the group home MC system in step 4, omitting steps 5 and 6.
5\. The gateway server determines which MC system is the group home system for
the MC service group.
6\. The gateway server in the serving system of MC service client 1 forwards
the MC service group affiliation request to the gateway server of the group
home MC system of the MC service group.
NOTE 2: If the group home MC system does not require topology hiding, the
request from the serving MC system of MC service client 1 is sent directly to
the group host MC service server in either step 4 or step 6, omitting steps 7
and 8.
7\. The gateway server of the group home MC system of the MC service group
determines which MC service server is the group host MC service server for
that MC service group.
8\. The gateway server of the group home system of the MC service group
forwards the MC service group affiliation request to the group host MC service
server of the MC service group.
9\. The group host MC service server in the partner MC system checks whether
the user of MC service client 1 is authorized to affiliate to the MC service
group based on the MC service group configuration. The group host MC service
server may optionally subscribe to the GMS containing the group configuration
information, and receive notification of group policy from the group
configuration. The group host MC service server shall update the GMS with the
affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service group by sending
the notify group dynamic data request (not shown in the figure).
10\. The group host MC service server sends an MC service group affiliation
response to the gateway server in the group home MC system of the MC service
group.
NOTE 3: If the group home MC system does not require topology hiding, the MC
service group affiliation response is sent directly to the gateway server of
the serving MC system of MC service client 1.
11\. The gateway server in the group home MC system forwards the MC service
group affiliation response to the gateway server in the serving MC system of
MC service client 1.
NOTE 4: If the serving MC system of MC service client 1 does not require
topology hiding, the MC service group affiliation response is sent directly to
the serving MC service server of MC service client 1.
12\. The gateway server in the serving MC system of MC service client 1
forwards the MC service group affiliation response to the serving MC service
server of MC service client 1.
13\. The serving MC service server of MC service client 1 forwards the MC
service group affiliation response to MC service client 1.
### 10.8.4 De-affiliation from MC service group(s)
#### 10.8.4.1 General
When an MC service user does not want to communicate with an MC service group
anymore for a single MC service, then the MC service user can revoke its
affiliation to the MC service group.
#### 10.8.4.2 MC service group de-affiliation procedure
The procedure for revoking the affiliation with an MC service group for a
single MC service is described in figure 10.8.4.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service server has already subscribed to the MC service group
information from group management server and has stored the data of MC service
group(s) to which the MC service user is affiliated to;
2\. The MC service client triggers the de-affiliation procedure. This is an
explicit de-affiliation requested either by the MC service user or determined
by a trigger event such as the MC service UE moving outside a permitted
geographic operational area of an MC service group; and
NOTE: The geographical operational area beyond which de-affiliation occurs may
be larger than the geographical operational area within which affiliation is
permitted, to avoid repeated affiliation and de-affiliation by a user on the
edge of an operational area.
3\. The group management server has subscribed to the MC service server within
the MC system where the group is defined for affiliation status updates.
4\. The MC service server has subscribed to the MC service functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 10.8.4.2-1: MC service group de-affiliation procedure
1\. MC service client requests the MC service server to de-affiliate from an
MC service group or a set of MC service groups.
2\. Based on the user profile and stored group policy from the group
configuration, the MC service server checks if the user of the MC service
client is authorized to de-affiliate from the requested MC service group(s)
and if the user of the MC service client has affiliated to the requested MC
service group(s). The authorisation check includes whether the MC service user
has activated a certain functional alias which prevents de-affiliating or
whether the MC service user is the last user who has bound a certain
functional alias to the group which also prevents de-affiliating.
3\. If the user of the MC service client has affiliated to the requested MC
service group(s), is authorized to de-affiliate from the requested MC service
group(s) then the MC service server removes the affiliation status of the user
for the requested MC service group(s), either for the requesting specific MC
service client only, or for all MC service clients, where this user has logged
on to.
4\. MC service server provides to the MC service client the group de-
affiliation response (4a). When the MC service user has logged into multiple
MC service clients concurrently, the MC service server updates the group
management server with the de-affiliation status of the user for the requested
MC service group(s) only when the MC service ID de-affiliates for the provided
MC service group(s) from the last MC service client. If the MC service user
has logged into only one client then the MC service server and update the
group management server with the de-affiliation status of the user for the
requested MC service group(s) (4b).
NOTE: Steps 4a and 4b can occur in any order or in parallel.
#### 10.8.4.3 De-affiliation from MC service group(s) defined in partner MC
system
The procedure for de-affiliation from affiliated MC service group(s) which is
defined in partner MC system for a single MC service is described in figure
10.8.4.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The primary/partner MC service servers have already subscribed to the
group information from group management server and stored the data of MC
service group(s) to which the MC service user intends to de-affiliate; and
2\. The group management server has subscribed to the MC service server within
the MC system where the group is defined for affiliation status updates.
Figure 10.8.4.3-1: De-affiliation from an MC service group defined in partner
MC system
1\. The MC service client requests the primary MC service server to de-
affiliate from an MC service group or a set of MC service groups.
2\. The primary MC service server checks if the MC service client is
authorized to de-affiliate from the requested MC service group(s) based on the
user profile. The primary MC service server performs the check if the user has
affiliated to the MC service groups.
3\. Based on the MC service group information included in the request, the
primary MC service server determines to send MC service group de-affiliation
request to the corresponding partner MC service server. The request may be
routed through some intermediate signalling nodes.
4\. Based on the stored group policy from the group configuration, the partner
MC service server checks if the MC service group is not disabled and if the
user of the MC service client has affiliated to the requested MC service
group(s) and is authorized to de-affiliate from the requested MC service
group(s).
5\. If the user of the MC service client has affiliated to the requested MC
service group(s) and is authorized to de-affiliate to the requested MC service
group(s), then the partner MC service server removes the affiliation status of
the user for the requested MC service group(s), either for the requesting
specific MC service client only, or for all MC service clients, where this
user has logged on to.
6\. The partner MC service server sends the MC service group de-affiliation
response to primary MC service server (6a) . When the MC service user has
logged into multiple MC service clients concurrently, the MC service server
updates the group management server with the de-affiliation status of the user
for the requested MC service group(s) only when the MC service ID de-
affiliates for the provided MC service group(s) from the last MC service
client. If the MC service user has logged into only one client then the MC
service server and updates the group management server with the de-affiliation
status of the user for the requested MC service group(s) (6b).
NOTE: Steps 6a and 6b can occur in any order or in parallel.
7\. The primary MC service server will remove any information stored about the
user\'s affiliation with requested MC service group(s) of partner MC system,
considering that the user may have logged on to multiple MC service clients
and that de-affiliation may have been performed only for the specific MC
service client from which the de-affiliation request has been sent, or for all
MC service clients, where this user has been affiliated to this MC service
group.
8\. The primary MC service server sends the MC service group de-affiliation
response to the MC service client.
#### 10.8.4.4 MC server initiated group de-affiliation procedure
The procedure for the MC service server to trigger a de-affiliation with an MC
service group is described in figure 10.8.4.4-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service user has previously affiliated to the group, and the MC
service server has stored the status of MC service group affiliation;
2\. Following a relevant trigger condition, e.g. the user moving outside the
permitted geographical operational area of the MC service group, or the
permitted geographical operational area is modified, causing user outside of
the permitted geographical operational area, the MC service server de-
affiliates the user from the MC service group; and
3\. The group management server has subscribed to the MC service server within
the MC system where the group is defined for affiliation status updates.
> 4\. The MC service server has subscribed to the MC service functional alias
> controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
> activation updates.
Figure 10.8.4.4-1: MC service server initiated group de-affiliation procedure
1\. The MC service server determines the MC service client could be de-
affiliated to the group again due to the trigger event, e.g. the permitted
geographical operational area is modified, causing the user outside of the
permitted geographical operational area of the MC service group, the MC
service server needs to de-affiliate the MC Service user from the group.
2\. The MC service server changes the affiliation status of the user.
3\. The MC service server updates the group management server with the de-
affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service group(s).
4\. The MC service server provides a de-affiliation notification with the
group information to the MC service client.
#### 10.8.4.5 MC server initiated group de-affiliation from group defined in
partner MC system
The procedure for the MC service server to trigger a de-affiliation from an MC
service group which is defined in partner MC system is described in figure
10.8.4.5-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service user has previously affiliated to the group, and the MC
service server has stored the status of MC service group affiliation;
2\. Following a relevant trigger condition (e.g. the user moving outside the
permitted geographical operational area of the MC service group, or the
permitted geographical operational area is modified), the de-affiliation for
the MC service user is initiated by the MC service server from the MC service
group;
3\. The primary/partner MC service servers have already subscribed to the
group information from group management server and stored the data of MC
service group(s) to which the MC service user intends to de-affiliate; and
4\. The group management server has subscribed to the MC service server within
the MC system where the group is defined for affiliation status updates.
Figure 10.8.4.5-1: MC service server initiated group de-affiliation from group
in partner system procedure
1\. The MC service server determines the MC service client could be de-
affiliated to the group due to the trigger event, e.g. the permitted
geographical operational area is modified, causing the user outside of the
permitted geographical operational area of the MC service group, the MC
service server needs to de-affiliate the MC Service user from the group.
2\. Based on the stored MC service group information, the primary MC service
server determines to send MC service group de-affiliation request to the
corresponding partner MC service server. The request may be routed through
some intermediate signalling nodes.
3\. Based on the stored group policy from the group configuration, the partner
MC service server checks if the MC service group is not disabled and if the
user of the MC service client has affiliated to the requested MC service
group(s) and is authorized to de-affiliate from the requested MC service
group(s).
4\. If the user of the MC service client has affiliated to the requested MC
service group(s) and is authorized to de-affiliate to the requested MC service
group(s), then the partner MC service server removes the affiliation status of
the user for the requested MC service group(s).
5\. The partner MC service server sends the MC service group de-affiliation
response to primary MC service server (5a) and updates the group management
server with the de-affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service
group(s) (5b).
NOTE: Steps 5a and 5b can occur in any order or in parallel.
6\. The primary MC service server changes the affiliation status of the user.
7\. The MC service server provides a de-affiliation notification with the
group information to the MC service client.
### 10.8.5 Remote change of affiliation
#### 10.8.5.1 Remote change of affiliation for groups defined in primary MC
system
##### 10.8.5.1.1 Authorized user remotely changes another MC service user\'s
affiliated MC service group(s) -- mandatory mode
The procedure for an authorized user to remotely change another MC service
user\'s affiliated MC service group(s) for a single MC service without
requiring the target user\'s approval is described in figure 10.8.5.1.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client 1 (authorized user 1) has already been provisioned
(statically or dynamically) with the target MC service user\'s information and
its group information, that target MC service user 2 is allowed to be
affiliated or de-affiliated;
2\. The primary MC service server may have retrieved the user profile or group
policy from the group configuration e.g. information regarding user(s)
authorization to affiliate or to de-affiliate to MC service group(s),
priority, and other related configuration data; and
3\. The group management server has subscribed to the MC service server within
the MC system where the group is defined for affiliation status updates.
Figure 10.8.5.1.1-1: Remotely change MC service group affiliation -- mandatory
mode
1\. When an authorized user requires one or more MC service users to change
the affiliation to an MC service group or set of MC service groups, the MC
service client 1 of the authorized user 1 sends MC service group affiliation
change request with the indication of mandatory mode to the primary MC service
server. The information used to indicate the change of the affiliation
relationship between the target MC service user 2 and the MC service group(s)
shall be included.
2\. The primary MC service server shall check if the MC service user 1 is
authorized to initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the
target user 2 and the MC service group(s). The primary MC service server shall
check if the target MC service user(s) are authorized for the requested
affiliation relationship based on the user profile. The primary MC service
server also performs the check for the maximum limit on the total number (N2)
of MC service groups that the user can be affiliated to simultaneously.
3a. The primary MC service server checks if the group policy is locally
cached. If the group policy is not locally cached on the MC service server,
then, the MC service server subscribes to the group policy from the group
configuration from the group management server.
3b. The primary MC service server receives the group policy from the group
configuration from the group management server via notification and locally
caches the group policy from the group configuration.
4\. Based on the group policy, the primary MC service server checks if the
target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate to the MC
service group(s).
5\. If the target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate
to the MC service group(s) then the primary MC service server stores the new
requested affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for the MC
service group(s).
6\. If the requested affiliation status is a change from the current
affiliation status, then the primary MC service server updates the group
management server with the affiliation status of the MC service user 2 for the
MC service group(s).
7a. If the requested affiliation status is a change the primary MC service
server sends the MC service group affiliation change request with the
indication of mandatory mode to MC service client 2 of the target MC service
user 2. The target MC service user 2 receives the latest information about the
affiliated MC service groups. The MC service client 2 may subscribe to the
affiliated MC service groups information with the group management server.
7b. The MC service user 2 provides a response to the primary MC service server
by sending an MC service group affiliation change response.
8\. The primary MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation
change response to MC service client 1. If the requested affiliation status
was not changed (see 7a), then the MC service server creates an appropriate
(accept) MC service group affiliation change response to send to MC service
client 1.
NOTE: Steps 6, 7a, 7b and 8 can occur in any order or in parallel, with the
restriction that step 7b can only occur after step 7a occurred.
##### 10.8.5.1.2 Authorized user remotely changes another MC service user\'s
affiliated MC service group(s) -- negotiated mode
The procedure for the authorized user to remotely change another MC service
user\'s affiliated MC service group(s) for a single MC service with the target
MC service user\'s approval is described in figure 10.8.5.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service client 1 (authorized user 1) has already been provisioned
(statically or dynamically) with target MC service user\'s information and its
group information, that target MC service user 2 is allowed to be affiliated
or de-affiliated;
\- The primary MC service server may have retrieved the user profile or group
policy from the group configuration e.g. information regarding user(s)
authorization to affiliate or to de-affiliate to MC service group(s),
priority, and other related configuration data.
Figure 10.8.5.1.2-1: Remotely change MC service group affiliation --
negotiated mode
1\. When an authorized user requires one or more MC service users to change
the affiliation to an MC service group or set of MC service groups, the MC
service client 1 of the authorized user 1 sends MC service group affiliation
change request to the primary MC service server. The information (i.e. target
MC service user(s) ID, MC service group(s) ID, requested affiliation status)
used to indicate the change of the affiliation relationship between the target
MC service user 2 and the MC service group(s) shall be included.
2\. The primary MC service server checks if the MC service user 1 is
authorized to initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the
target user 2 and the MC service group(s). The primary MC service server
checks if the target MC service user(s) are authorized for the requested
affiliation relationship based on the user profile and the group policy from
the group configuration (i.e. if not available, the primary MC service server
obtains the group policy from the group configuration from the group
management server). The primary MC service server also performs the check for
the maximum limit on the total number (N2) of MC service groups that the user
can be affiliated to simultaneously.
3\. If the target MC service user 2 is authorized to accept the changes to its
affiliated MC service group(s), then the primary MC service server sends the
MC service group affiliation change request to the MC service client 2 of the
target MC service user 2.
4\. If the requested affiliation status is different from the current
affiliation status, then the MC service client 2 notifies the MC service group
affiliation change request to the target MC service user 2 to receive the
approval from the user on the proposed changes to the affiliated MC service
group(s).
NOTE 1: The procedure is aborted if the target MC service user 2 does not
respond to the notification within an implementation dependent time.
5\. If the target MC service user 2 provides a response (accept or reject) to
the notification, then the MC service client 2 sends an MC service group
affiliation change response to the primary MC service server. A response
indicating target user 2\'s acceptance to the requested affiliation change by
authorized user 1, triggers the affiliation or de-affiliation procedures at
the primary MC service server (see subclause 10.8.3.1 or subclause 10.8.4.2)
as per the MC service user 1\'s requested changes to the target user 2\'s
affiliated group(s).
NOTE 2: In the case where the affiliation changes for target user 2 includes
MC service groups defined in partner MC systems, the primary MC service server
performs the affiliation or de-affiliation procedures by interacting with the
partner MC systems (see subclause 10.8.3.2 or subclause 10.8.4.3).
6\. The primary MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation
change response to the MC service client 1. If the requested affiliation
status was not changed (see 4), then the MC service server creates an
appropriate (accept) MC service group affiliation change response to send to
MC service client 1.
NOTE 3: If multiple MC service groups are included in step 1, and these MC
service groups belong to different partner MC systems, the primary MC service
server can wait until all the partner MC systems provides the MC service group
affiliation change response messages.
#### 10.8.5.2 Remote change of affiliation for groups defined in partner MC
system
##### 10.8.5.2.1 Authorized user remotely changes another MC service user\'s
affiliated MC service group(s) defined in partner MC system -- mandatory mode
The procedure for the authorized user to remotely change another MC service
user\'s affiliated MC service group(s) defined in partner MC systems for a
single MC service without requiring the target user\'s approval is described
in figure 10.8.5.2.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client 1 (authorized user) has already been provisioned
(statically or dynamically) with the target MC service user 2\'s information
and group information, that the target MC service user 2 is allowed to be
affiliated or de-affiliated;
2\. The MC service client 1 (authorized user 1), MC service client 2 (target
MC service user 2), and the primary MC service server belong to the same MC
system;
3\. The partner MC service server may have retrieved the group related
information from the group management server;
4\. The primary MC service server may have retrieved the user policy e.g. user
related information regarding user(s) authorization to affiliate or to de-
affiliate to MC service group(s), priority, and other related configuration
data; and
5\. The partner group management server has subscribed to the MC service
server within the MC system where the group is defined for affiliation status
updates.
Figure 10.8.5.2.1-1: Remote change MC service group affiliation defined in
partner MC system -- mandatory mode
1\. When an authorized user requires one or more MC service users to change
the affiliation to an MC service group or set of MC service groups, the MC
service client 1 of the authorized user 1 sends MC service group affiliation
change request with the indication of mandatory mode to the primary MC service
server. The information (i.e. target MC service user(s) ID, MC service
group(s) ID, requested affiliation status) used to indicate the change of the
affiliation relationship between the target MC service user 2 and the MC
service group(s) shall be included.
2\. The primary MC service server shall check if the MC service user 1 is
authorized to initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the
target user 2 and the MC service group(s). The primary MC service server shall
check if the target MC service user(s) are authorized for the requested
affiliation relationship based on the user profile. The primary MC service
server also performs the check for the maximum limit on the total number (N2)
of MC service groups that the user can be affiliated to simultaneously.
3\. Based on the MC service group information included in the request, the
primary MC service server determines to send MC service group affiliation
change request to the corresponding partner MC service server (group host
server).
4a. The partner MC service server checks if the group policy is locally
cached. If the group policy is not locally cached on the partner MC service
server then the partner MC service server subscribes to the group policy from
the group configuration from the group management server.
4b. The partner MC service server receives the group policy from the group
configuration from the group management server via notification and locally
caches the group policy from the group configuration.
5\. Based on the group policy, the partner MC service server checks if the
target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate to the MC service
group(s). It is possible that the target MC service user 2 affiliates to one
or more MC service groups and also de-affiliates from one or more MC service
groups.
6\. If the target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate
to the MC service group(s) and if the requested affiliation status is
different to the current affiliation status, then the partner MC service
server stores the new affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for
the MC service group(s).
7\. The partner MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation
change response to the primary MC service server.
8\. The partner MC service server updates the group management server with the
affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for the MC service
group(s).
NOTE: Steps 7 and 8 can occur in any order or in parallel.
9\. If the requested affiliation status is different to the current
affiliation status, then the primary MC service server stores the new
affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for the MC service
group(s).
10a. If the requested affiliation status is different to the current
affiliation status, then the primary MC service server sends the MC service
group affiliation change request with the indication of mandatory mode to MC
service client 2 of the target MC service user 2. The target MC service user 2
receives the latest information about the affiliated MC service groups.
Further the MC service client 2 may subscribe for the affiliated MC service
groups information with the group management server.
10b. The target MC service client 2 provides an MC service group affiliation
change response to the MC service server.
11\. The primary MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation
change response to MC service client 1 (authorized user). If the requested
affiliation status was not changed (see 10a), then the MC service server
creates an appropriate (accept) MC service group affiliation change response
to send to MC service client 1.
## 10.9 Location management (on-network)

### 10.9.3 Procedure
#### 10.9.3.1 Event-triggered location reporting procedure
NOTE 1: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.
The location management server provides location reporting configuration to
the location management clients, indicating what information the location
management server expects and what events will trigger the sending of this
information to the location management server. The decision to report location
information can be triggered at the location management client by different
conditions. The conditions could include, for example, the reception of the
location reporting configuration, initial registration, distance travelled,
elapsed time, cell change, MBMS SAI change, MBMS session change, leaving a
specific MBMS bearer service area, tracking area change, PLMN change, call
initiation, or other types of events such as emergency alert, emergency call
or imminent peril calls. The location report can include information described
as time of measurement, accuracy, longitude, latitude, speed, bearing,
altitude, ECGI, MBMS SAIs.
Figure 10.9.3.1-1: Event-triggered location reporting procedure
1\. The location management server sends location reporting configuration
message to the location management client(s) containing the initial
configuration (or a subsequent update) for reporting the location of the MC
service UE. This message can be sent over a unicast bearer to a specific
location management client or as a group message over an MBMS bearer to update
the location reporting configuration for multiple location management clients
at the same time.
NOTE 2: The location reporting configuration information can be made part of
the user profile, in which case the sending of the message is not necessary.
NOTE 3: Different location management clients may be given different location
reporting criteria.
2\. A location reporting event occurs, triggering step 3.
3\. The location management client sends a location information report to the
location management server, containing location information identified by the
location management server and available to the location management client.
4\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management client
before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location
management client. If the location information report contains an optional MC
service UE label, the location management server stores it together with the
location information for the reporting location management client.
#### 10.9.3.2 On-demand location reporting procedure
NOTE: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.
The location management server can request MC service UE location information
at any time by sending a location information request to the location
management client, which may trigger location management client to immediately
send the location report.
Figure 10.9.3.2-1: On-demand location information reporting procedure
1\. Based on configurations such as periodical location information timer, or
location information request from other entities (e.g., another location
management client of an authorized user, MC service server), location
management server initiates the immediate request of location information to
be sent from the location management client.
2\. The location management server sends a location information request to the
location management client.
3\. The location management client immediately responds to the location
management server with a report containing location information identified by
the location management server and available to the location management
client.
4\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management
client, the location management server just stores the reporting location
information for that location management client. If the location information
report contains an optional MC service UE label, the location management
server stores it together with the location information for the reporting
location management client.
#### 10.9.3.3 Client-triggered location reporting procedure
NOTE: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.
Figure 10.9.3.3-1 illustrates the high level procedure of client-triggered
location reporting.
Figure 10.9.3.3-1: Client-triggered location reporting procedure
1\. Location management client 2 (authorized MC service user) sends a location
reporting trigger to the location management server to activate a location
reporting procedure for obtaining the location information of location
management client 1.
2\. Location management server checks whether location management client 2 is
authorized to send a location reporting trigger for location management client
1\'s location information. Depending on the information specified by the
location reporting trigger, location management server initiates an on-demand
location reporting procedure or an event-triggered location reporting
procedure for the location of location management client 1.
#### 10.9.3.4 Location reporting cancel procedure
NOTE: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.
The location reporting cancel procedure reuses the information flow of
location reporting configuration.
Pre-conditions:
\- The location management client has been provided with location reporting
configuration information.
Figure 10.9.3.4-1: Location reporting cancel procedure
1\. The location management server sends location reporting configuration
without any information element to the location management client to stop
location reporting from the MC service UE.
2\. The location management client stops sending location information reports
to the location management server.
#### 10.9.3.5 Location information subscription procedure
NOTE 1: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.
Figure 10.9.3.5-1 illustrates the high level procedure of location information
subscription request. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to MC
service user location information.
Figure 10.9.3.5-1: Location information subscription request procedure
1\. MC service server or location management client sends a location
information subscription request to the location management server to
subscribe location information of one or more MC service users.

#### 10.9.3.6 Usage of location information procedure
##### 10.9.3.6.1 Event-trigger location information notification procedure
NOTE 1: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.
Figure 10.9.3.6.1-1 illustrates the high level procedure of event-trigger
usage of location information. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location
information of MC service user.
Pre-condition:
1\. The MC service server or location management client has subscribed to the
location information of a target MC service user.
Figure 10.9.3.6.1-1: Event-trigger usage of location information procedure
1\. Based on configuration, e.g., subscription, periodical location
information timer, the location management server is triggered to report the
latest user location information of the target MC service user to the
subscribed MC service server or subscribed location management client. The
location management server has verified that the subscribed MC service server
or subscribed location management client is authorized to receive the user
location information of the target MC service user.
2\. The location management server sends the location information notification
including the latest location information of one MC service user to the MC
service server or to the location management client. The latest location
information is derived from the location report procedure as described in
clause 10.9.3.1, or from PLMN operator (e.g. LCS network). If the optional MC
service UE label is present, the location management server sends it, as part
of the location information notification, to the MC service user.
NOTE 2: The MC service server does not receive the MC service UE label.
##### 10.9.3.6.2 On-demand usage of location information procedure
NOTE 1: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.
The MC service server or the location management client can request location
information at any time by sending a location information request to the
location management server, which may trigger location management server to
send the location information report immediately.

information of the MC service users that may share the contained functional
alias. Location management client 1 may include its own activated functional
alias.
2\. Location management server checks whether location management client 1 is
authorized to send a location reporting trigger for location information of
location management clients 2 and 3.
3\. The location management server uses on-demand location reporting
procedures. The location information request contains the functional alias
provided by the location management client 1 to address location management
client 2 and location management client 3.
4\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management clients. If the location management
server does not have location information of a reporting location management
client before, then just stores the reporting location information for that
location management client.
5\. The location management server sends location report responses to location
management client 1 containing the provided location information for each
location management client using the given functional alias. If the optional
MC service UE label is present, the location management server sends it, as
part of the location report response to location management client 1. If not
all location management clients immediately respond to the location management
server, i.e. other reports some time later, subsequent location reporting
responses may be sent.
##### 10.9.3.8.2 Client-triggered periodic location information report

NOTE 1: In accordance with local policies, the LMC can apply local
restrictions by stopping providing location information when a location
dissemination request has been activated.
2\. The location management server checks if the location management client 1
is authorized to restrict the location information dissemination.
3\. The location management server updates restriction information of the
reporting location management client 1. If the location management server does
not have the restriction record for the location information dissemination of
the requesting location management client 1 before, then just store the
restriction record for that location management client 1.
NOTE 2: The location server, depending on local policies, can choose to not
apply the restriction of location information for emergency services (e.g.
Emergency Call, Emergency alert, Imminent peril call, etc.) and for authorized
users (e.g. dispatcher, supervisor).
4\. The location management server sends the restrict location information
dissemination response to the location management client 1 to confirm the
status of the restrict location information dissemination request.
5\. The location management server may inform all the subscribed users (in
accordance with local policies and local requirements) that the location
information from this particular user will be provided or not by sending the
restrict location information dissemination notification upon successfully
applying restrictions on location dissemination as described in step 3 above.

#### 10.10.1.2 MC service emergency alert
##### 10.10.1.2.1 MC service emergency alert initiation
###### 10.10.1.2.1.1 General
These procedures describe cases where an MC service client is initiating an MC
service emergency alert unicast signalling for communicating the alert with
the affiliated MC service group members of an MC service group, or for
communicating an alert to another MC service client. An MC service client in
the MC service emergency state gains elevated access privilege for all of the
MC service user\'s mission critical applications. These procedures will place
the MC service client in the MC service emergency state if the MC service
client is not already in that state.
##### 10.10.1.2.1.2 MC service group emergency alert initiation {#mc-service-
group-emergency-alert-initiation .H6}
Figure 10.10.1.2.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the MC service client
initiating an MC service emergency alert with an MC service group i.e., MC
service users on MC service client 1, MC service client 2 and MC service
client 3 belong to the same MC service group which is defined on group
management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MC service server is shown in place of a user
home MC service server and a group hosting MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service group to be used for emergency communications by MC service
client 1 is previously defined on the group management server and MC service
client 2 and MC service client 3 are affiliated to that MC service group.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the currently selected group.
2\. All members of the MC service group belong to the same MC system.
3\. The initiating MC service client 1 is affiliated with one or more MC
service groups.
4\. The initiating MC service client 1 may not have carried out an explicit
affiliation procedure with the MC service group designated as the MC service
emergency group.
5\. Optionally, MC service client 1 may use an activated functional alias for
the group communication.
6\. The MC service server may have subscribed to the MC service functional
alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias
activation/de-activation updates.
Figure 10.10.1.2.1.2-1 MC service group emergency alert
1\. The MC service user at the MC service client 1 initiates an MC service
emergency alert. MC service client 1 sets its MC service emergency state. The
MC service user at MC service client 1 may select a functional alias used for
the MC service group emergency alert. The MC service emergency state is
retained by the MC service client 1 until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MC service client 1 requests the MC service server to send an MC service
emergency alert request to the MC service group designated as the MC service
emergency group.
3\. MC service server checks whether the MC service user of MC service client
1 is authorized for initiation of MC service group emergency alerts for the
indicated MC service group. The MC service server checks whether the provided
functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
4\. MC service server resolves the MC service group ID to determine the
members of that MC service group and their affiliation status, based on the
information from group management server.
5\. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert response to the
MC service user 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert request. All MC
service group calls made by the MC service client 1 will be sent as emergency
calls until the emergency state on the MC service client 1 is cancelled. All
MC service private calls made by the MC service client 1 will be sent as
emergency calls until the emergency state on the MC service client 1 is
cancelled.
6\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert request towards
the MC service clients of each of those affiliated MC service group members.
The MC service emergency alert request message shall contain the following
information: Location, MC service ID and MC service group ID (i.e., MC service
user\'s selected MC service group or dedicated MC service emergency group, as
per user profile configuration) and the MC service user\'s mission critical
organization name. If in step 2, the MC service client 1 does not include the
location information in the MC service emergency alert request to the MC
service server, the MC service server acquires the location information of the
MC service user at the MC service client 1 from the location management
server. If the location information is included in step 2, then the MC service
server uses the location information from MC service client 1.
7\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency alert. The
functional alias of the group call initiating MC service user may be
displayed.
8\. The receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency alert
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency
alert.
9\. The MC service server implicitly affiliates the client to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
NOTE 3: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
emergency call does not put the group into the in-progress emergency state.
NOTE 4: Sending the emergency alert does not put the other UEs in the group
into an emergency state.
NOTE 5: The MC service client 1 need not initiate a group call. For example,
the MC service client can be configured to only allow alerts or the MC service
user can choose not to make an MC service emergency group call.
NOTE 6: It is configured whether MC service client 1 automatically triggers a
subsequent MC service emergency group call.
Editor\'s note: How emergency alert is synchronized between MC services is
FFS.
###### 10.10.1.2.1.3 MC service individual emergency alert initiation
Figure 10.10.1.2.1.3-1 illustrates the procedure for the MC service client
initiating an MC service individual emergency alert. This emergency alert can
be sent at the time of emergency private call initiation as specified in
subclause 10.7.2.4.1 of TS 23.379 [16], or it can also be sent standalone as
described below.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service ID of MC service client 2 is previously defined to be used
for emergency communications by MC service client 1.
2\. Optionally, MC service client 1 may use an activated functional alias for
individual communication.
3\. The MC service server may have subscribed to the MC service functional
alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias
activation/de-activation updates.
Figure 10.10.1.2.1.3-1 MC service individual emergency alert
1\. The MC service user at the MC service client 1 initiates an MC service
individual emergency alert. MC service client 1 sets its MC service emergency
state. The MC service user at MC service client 1 may select a functional
alias to be used for the MC service individual emergency alert. MCPTT client 1
retains the MC service emergency state until explicitly cancelled by the user
of MC service client 1.
2\. MC service client 1 requests the MC service server to send an MC service
emergency alert request to MC service client 2 that has been designated as the
target of MC service emergency communication by MC service client 1.
3\. MC service server checks whether the MC service user of MC service client
1 is authorized for initiation of an MC service individual emergency alerts.
The MC service server checks whether the provided functional alias, if
present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
4\. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert response to the
MC service user 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert request.
NOTE 1: While MC service client 1 is in the emergency state, all MC service
group and private calls initiated by MC service client 1 are initiated as MC
service emergency calls.
5\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert request toward
MC service client 2. The MC service emergency alert request message shall
contain the following information: Location, MC service ID, and the MC service
user\'s mission critical organization name. If in step 2, the MC service
client 1 does not include the location information in the MC service emergency
alert request to the MC service server, the MC service server acquires the
location information of the MC service user at the MC service client 1 from
the location management server. If the location information is included in
step 2, then the MC service server uses the location information from MC
service client 1.
6\. MC service user of MC service client 2 is notified of the MC service
emergency alert. The functional alias of the initiating MC service user may be
displayed.
NOTE 2: MC service client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MC service emergency alert.
7\. The receiving MC service client 2 sends the MC service emergency alert
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency
alert.
NOTE 3: The MC service client 1 need not initiate a private call to MC service
client 2.
##### 10.10.1.2.2 MC service emergency alert cancel
###### 10.10.1.2.2.1 General
These procedures describe cases where an MC service client has initiated an MC
service emergency alert and entered the emergency state, and wishes to cancel
the alert. For group-based alerts the cancellation informs the MC service
server and other group members of this cancellation. By doing so, the MC
service client may also request the cancellation of the in-progress emergency
state of the group. For individual-based alerts the cancellation informs the
MC service server and the MC service user designated as the target of MC
service emergency communication.
In both cases the cancellation of the MC service emergency alert clears the
emergency state of the MC service client.
For group-based emergency alerts, the emergency state of the MC service user
can alternatively be cancelled using the MC service in-progress emergency
group state cancellation procedures in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], TS 23.281[12], and
TS 23.282 [13].
###### 10.10.1.2.2.2 MC service group emergency alert cancel
Figure 10.10.1.2.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the MC service client
cancelling an MC service emergency alert with an MC service group i.e., MC
service users on MC service client 1, MC service client 2 and MC service
client 3 belong to the same MC service group which is defined on MC service
group management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MC service server is shown in place of a user
home MC service server and a group hosting MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client 1 had previously successfully initiated an MC
service emergency alert targeted to a group.
2\. The MC service client 1 is still in the emergency state.
3\. The initiating MC service client 1 has affiliated with the MC service
group designated as the MC service emergency group.
Figure 10.10.1.2.2.2-1 MC service group emergency alert cancel
1\. The MC service user at the MC service client 1 initiates an MC service
emergency alert cancel to inform the server that MC service client 1 is no
longer in the emergency state.
NOTE 2: The MC service emergency alert cancel request can carry an indication
to also request that the in-progress emergency of the group is to be
cancelled. The MC service server can accept or deny the request to cancel the
in-progress emergency state of the group as a whole, separately from accepting
or denying the request to cancel the emergency alert at MC service client 1.
An authorized user (e.g. dispatcher, supervisor) can cancel either or both the
in-progress emergency state of the group and the MC service emergency alert of
another user. A MC service user is always authorized to cancel the emergency
state of their own client. Determination of authorized users is implementation
dependent.
2\. MC service client 1 requests the MC service server to send an MC service
emergency alert cancel to the MC service group to which MC service client 1
had previously sent the emergency alert.
3\. MC service server resolves the MC service group ID to determine the
members of that MC service group and their affiliation status, based on the
information from group management server.
4\. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert cancel response
to the MC service client 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert cancel
request. MC service client 1 clears its emergency state.
5\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert cancel request
towards the MC service clients of each of those affiliated MC service group
members.
6\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency alert
cancellation of MC service client 1.
7\. For a unicast MC service emergency alert cancel, the receiving MC service
clients send the MC service emergency alert cancel response to the MC service
server to acknowledge the MC service emergency alert cancel. For a multicast
MC service emergency alert cancel, these acknowledgements are not sent unless
the MC service clients have been configured to do so.
###### 10.10.1.2.2.3 MC service individual emergency alert cancel
Figure 10.10.1.2.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure for the MC service client
cancelling an individual MC service emergency alert (i.e. without an
associated MC service group).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client 1 had previously successfully initiated an
individual MC service emergency alert targeted to MC service client 2.
2\. The MC service client 1 is still in the emergency state.
Figure 10.10.1.2.2.3-1 MC service individual emergency alert cancel
1\. The MC service user at the MC service client 1 initiates an MC service
individual emergency alert cancel for an individual emergency alert.
2\. MC service client 1 sends the MC service emergency alert cancel request to
the MC service server to inform the server that MC service client 1 is no
longer in the emergency state. The emergency alert cancel request contains the
MC service ID of MC service client 2.
3\. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert cancel response
to the MC service client 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert cancel
request. MC service client 1 clears its emergency state.
4\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert cancel request
towards MC service client 2.
5\. The MC service user of MC service client 2 is notified of the MC service
emergency alert cancellation of MC service client 1.
6\. MC service client 2 sends the MC service emergency alert cancel response
to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency alert cancel.
##### 10.10.1.2.3 Entering MC service emergency alert area
Editor\'s Note: MC service emergency alert triggered by MC service client
locally which stores the pre-defined area is another possible solution. How to
define this procedure and how to combine the two solutions is FFS.
The procedure focuses on the case where an MC service emergency alert to be
triggered when an MC service UE moves into a pre-defined area. This procedure
will place the MC service client in the MC service emergency state if the MC
service client is not already in that state.
Procedures in figure 10.10.1.2.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MC service server triggering an MC service emergency alert with an MC
service group i.e., MC service users on MC service client 1, MC service client
2 and MC service client 3 belong to the same MC service group which is defined
on MC service group management server. This procedure will place the MC
service client in the MC service emergency state if the MC service client is
not already in that state.
NOTE: For simplicity, a single MC service server is shown in place of a user
home MC service server and a group hosting MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service group is previously defined on the group management server
with MC service client 2 and MC service client 3 affiliated to that MC service
group.
2\. All members of the MC service group belong to the same MC system.
3\. An area in which the MC service client should send emergency alert is pre-
defined in MC service server.
Figure 10.10.1.2.3-1 Entering MC service emergency alert area
1\. MC service server acquires the latest location information of user at MC
service client 1 from location management server as described in 10.9.3.6.
2\. MC service server checks whether MC service client 1 has moved into a pre-
defined area.
3\. If so, MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert area
notification to MC service client 1 to notify that it has moved into the area
in potential danger.
4\. MC service client 1 notifies the MC service user about the MC service
emergency alert area.
5\. MC service client 1 initiates MC service emergency alert procedure as
described in 10.10.1.2.1.
##### 10.10.1.2.4 Leaving MC service emergency alert area
This procedure focuses on the case where a notification is sent when an MC
service UE moves out of a pre-defined area. This procedure will notify the MC
service client that it is now out of the pre-defined emergency alert area. It
is up to the MC service user at that MC service client to determine if the
emergency state is to be cleared or not.
Procedures in figure 10.10.1.2.4-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert area
notification. It is optional if the MC service user wants to initiate the MC
service emergency alert cancel procedure to inform the members in the MC
service group that its emergency condition is over.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MC service server is shown in place of a user
home MC service server and a group hosting MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service group is previously defined on the group management server
with MC service client 2 and MC service client 3 affiliated to that MC service
group. This MC service group has been pre-defined for communicating the
emergency alert in the user profile.
2\. All members of the MC service group belong to the same MC system.
3\. An area in which the emergency alert for the MC service client should
remain active is pre-defined in MC service server.
Figure 10.10.1.2.4-1 Leaving MC service emergency alert area
1\. MC service server acquires the latest location information of user at MC
service client 1 from location management server as described in subclause
10.9.3.6.
2\. MC service server checks whether MC service client 1 has moved out a pre-
defined area.
3\. If so, MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert area
notification to MC service client 1 to notify that it has moved out of the
area in potential danger.
4\. MC service client 1 notifies the MC service user about the MC service
emergency alert area cancel. It is up to the MC service user at the MC service
client 1 to determine if the emergency state is clear.
5\. Optionally, the MC service user of MC service client 1 initiates MC
service emergency alert cancel procedure as described in 10.10.1.2.2.
NOTE 2: It is up to the MC service user to clear the local emergency state on
the client after the MC service UE has moved out of the emergency alert area,
the MC service server cannot clear the client\'s local emergency state.

##### 10.10.2.2.1 Emergency alert initiation
Figure 10.10.2.2.1-1 describes procedures for the MC service client initiating
an MC service emergency alert with an MC service group.
This procedure will place the MC service client in the MC service emergency
state if the MC service client is not already in that state.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The initiating MC service client 1 has been provisioned with an MC service
group designated as the MC service emergency group.
NOTE 1: Alternatively, MC service client 1 could have been provisioned for
emergency behaviour on the currently selected group.
2\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MC
service group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in
MC service client 1.
3\. MC service clients 2 and 3 belong to and are ready for off-network
communications on the MC service group.
Figure 10.10.2.2.1-1: Emergency alert initiation
1\. MC service client 1 sets its MC service emergency state. This MC service
emergency state is retained by the MC service client until explicitly
cancelled. Once MC service client1 is in the MC service emergency state, any
communications initiated by MC service client 1, group or private, shall be
initiated as emergency communications and shall receive priority treatment.
2\. MC service client 1 sends an MC service emergency alert announcement to
the other participants on the MC service emergency group. The MC service
emergency alert announcement is sent periodically so that late joining MC
service group members are notified.
NOTE 2: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
MC service emergency communication does not put the group into the in-progress
emergency state.
3\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency state of the
originating MC service user.
> 4\. The MC service clients upon receiving the emergency alert announcement
> message acknowledge the MC service emergency alert to the originating MC
> service client.
>
> NOTE 3: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start
> an emergency call does not put the group into the in-progress emergency
> state.
NOTE 4: The MC service client 1 needs not initiate a group communication. For
example, the MC service client can be configured to only allow alerts or the
MC service user can choose not to make an MC service emergency group
communication.
NOTE 5: MC service clients need to respond only to the first emergency alert
announcement message that is received.
NOTE 6: It is configured if MC service client 1 will automatically trigger a
subsequent MC service emergency group call.
5\. The originating MC service client 1 checks the responses and may inform
the MC service user of the MC service group members whose MC service clients
responded.
##### 10.10.2.2.2 Emergency alert cancel
An MC service client has initiated an MC service emergency alert, has entered
the MC service emergency state and wishes to cancel the alert, informing the
other MC service group members of the cancellation. As part of this process,
the MC service client may also request the cancellation of the in-progress
emergency state in the group if authorized to do so.

#### 10.10.3.3 Procedures within single MC system
##### 10.10.3.3.1 Ad hoc group emergency alert initiation
Figure 10.10.3.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure for the MC service client
initiating an ad hoc group emergency alert initiated by an authorized MC
service user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service user at MC service client 1 wants to send an ad hoc group
emergency alert to the MC service users who are satisfying certain criteria.
2\. All MC service clients belong to the same MC system.
3\. The MC service user on MC service client 3 is authorized to receive ad hoc
group participants information.
Figure 10.10.3.3.1-1: Ad hoc group emergency alert initiation
1\. The MC service user at the MC service client 1 initiates an ad hoc group
emergency alert to an ad hoc group with participants satisfying specific
criteria. The MC service user may add additional information describing the
reason for sending the alert.
2\. MC service client 1 initiates the ad hoc group emergency alert by sending
the ad hoc group emergency alert request containing the details of the
criteria to be applied by the MC service server for determining the
participants list or the list of participants. MC service client 1 may set its
MC service emergency state. The MC service user at MC service client 1 may
select a functional alias used for the MC service group emergency alert. If MC
service client 1 is in MC service emergency state, the MC service emergency
state is retained by the MC service client 1 until explicitly cancelled.
3\. MC service server checks whether the MC service user of MC service client
1 is authorized for initiation of ad hoc group emergency alerts and whether
the request is supported. The MC service server checks whether the provided
functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
4\. The MC service server determines the list of participants to be invited
for the ad hoc group emergency alert based on the information present in the
information element Criteria for determining the participants. This
information element could carry either criteria or indicator identifying the
criteria or combination of both. The MC service server stores the ad hoc group
ID together with the list of participants for the duration of the ad hoc group
emergency alert. The MC service server considers the alerted participants as
implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
5\. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group emergency alert response to
the MC service user 1 to confirm the ad hoc group emergency alert request is
granted. The MC service server adds the ad hoc group ID (generated by the MC
service server in the case where the MC service ad hoc group ID created by the
MC service client 1 is not acceptable or the case where the MC service ad hoc
group ID was not provided by MC service client 1).
6\. The MC service server sends an ad hoc group emergency alert request
including the ad hoc group ID towards the MC service clients 2 and 3.
7\. MC service users are notified of the ad hoc group emergency alert. The
functional alias of the MC service user initiating the ad hoc group emergency
alert and additional information related to the alert may be displayed.
8\. The receiving MC service clients send the ad hoc group emergency alert
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the ad hoc group emergency
alert.
9\. The authorized user on MC service client 3 is notified with the list of MC
service IDs of those MC service users who are currently in the ad hoc group.
10\. If configured, an MC service client may setup a subsequent ad hoc group
emergency communication, using the ad hoc group ID from the ad hoc group
emergency alert, according to 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] or 3GPP
TS 23.282 [13].
NOTE 1: MC service client 1 may start the subsequent ad hoc group emergency
communication after step 5.
NOTE 2: Sending the ad hoc group emergency alert without making a request to
also start an ad hoc group emergency communication does not put the group into
the in-progress emergency state.
NOTE 3: Sending the ad hoc group emergency alert does not put the other
participants in the group into an MC service emergency state.
The MC service server continuously checks whether other MC service clients
meet or if participating MC service clients no longer meet the criteria for
the ad hoc group emergency alert.
##### 10.10.3.3.2 Ad hoc group emergency alert cancel
Figure 10.10.3.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the MC service client
cancelling an ad hoc group emergency alert associated with an ad hoc group
i.e., MC service users on MC service client 1, MC service client 2 and MC
service client 3 belong to the same ad hoc group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client 1 is authorised to cancel the ad hoc group emergency
alert (as configured in the user profile data according to 3GPP TS 23.379
[16], 3GPP TS 23.281 [4] or 3GPP TS 23.282 [5]).
2\. The initiating MC service client 1 is a participant of the ad hoc group
associated with the ongoing emergency alert.
Figure 10.10.3.3.2-1: Ad hoc group emergency alert cancel
1\. The MC service user at the MC service client 1 initiates an ad hoc group
emergency alert cancel to inform the MC service server that alert is to be
cancelled.
NOTE 1: The ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request can carry an
indication to also request that the in-progress emergency of the group is to
be cancelled. The MC service server can accept or deny the request to cancel
the in-progress emergency state of the group, separately from accepting or
denying the request to cancel the emergency alert at MC service client 1.
2\. MC service client 1 sends an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request
to the MC service server. If the cancel request is for another MC service user
that initiated this emergency alert, that user's MC service ID shall be
included in the request.
3\. MC service server uses the ad hoc group ID to select the participants of
that ad hoc group.
4\. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group emergency alert cancel
response to the MC service client 1 to confirm the ad hoc group emergency
alert cancel request. If MC service client 1 has initiated the ad hoc group
emergency alert and its MC service emergency state is set, then the MC service
emergency state is cleared.
NOTE 2: If MC service client 1 has not initiated the ad hoc group emergency
alert, the MC service emergency state on the MC service client which initiated
the ad hoc group emergency alert is retained locally by the MC service client
until explicitly manually cancelled by the MC service user.
NOTE 3: The MC service emergency state of an MC service client due to an ad
hoc group emergency alert or an ad hoc group communication is considered as a
different state as from an MC service emergency state set by an MC service
emergency group call or an MC service group emergency alert.
5\. The MC service server sends an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request
towards the participants of the ad hoc group associated with the ad hoc group
emergency alert.
6\. MC service users are notified of the ad hoc group emergency alert
cancellation and the MC service emergency state is cleared.
7\. The receiving MC service clients send the ad hoc group emergency alert
cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the ad hoc group
emergency alert cancel.
NOTE 4: If there is no ongoing communication in the ad hoc group or once the
ongoing communication in the ad hoc group is terminated, the MC service server
removes the ad hoc group.
##### 10.10.3.3.3 Entering an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert
During an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert, the MC service server
continuously checks if additional MC service users meet the conditions of the
ad hoc group emergency alert.
As illustrated in Figure 10.10.3.3.3-1 MC service client is added to the ad
hoc group as the MC service client meets the criteria for receiving an ongoing
ad hoc group emergency alert.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An ad hoc group emergency alert has been initiated and the related ad hoc
group exists.
2\. The criteria for entering an ad hoc group emergency alert are known to the
MC service server.
3\. The MC service user on MC service client 2 is authorized to receive ad hoc
group participants information.
Figure 10.10.3.3.3-1: Entering an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert
1\. MC service server acquires the latest information of the MC service user
at the MC service client and checks whether the criteria for initiating an ad
hoc group emergency alert to the MC service client are met. The MC service
server considers the MC service client 1 to be implicitly affiliated to the ad
hoc group associated to the emergency alert.
2\. The MC service server sends an ad hoc group emergency alert request
notification to MC service client 1 to notify that it has moved into potential
danger. The MC service client 1 is added to the emergency ad hoc group.
3\. MC service client 1 notifies the MC service user about the ad hoc group
emergency alert.
4\. The receiving MC service client 1 sends the ad hoc group emergency alert
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the ad hoc group emergency
alert.
5\. The authorized user on MC service client 2 is notified with the list of MC
service IDs of those MC service users who are currently in the ad hoc group
including the newly added MC service client 1.
6\. If there is an ongoing ad hoc group emergency communication ongoing, the
MC service server adds the MC service client to the list of ad hoc group
emergency communication participants according to 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS
23.281 [12] or 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
##### 10.10.3.3.4 Leaving an ad hoc group emergency alert
During an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert, the MC service server
continuously checks if MC service users still meet the conditions of the
emergency alert.
As illustrated in Figure 10.10.3.3.4-1 MC service client is removed from the
ad hoc group associated with an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert as the MC
service client does not meet the criteria for the alert any longer and the
emergency alert is removed from the MC service client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An ad hoc group emergency alert has been initiated and the related ad hoc
group exists.
2\. The MC service server is aware of the criteria for leaving an ad hoc
emergency alert.
3\. The MC service user on MC service client 2 is authorized to receive ad hoc
group participants information.
Figure 10.10.3.3.4-1: Leaving an ad hoc group emergency alert
1\. MC service server acquires the latest information of the MC service user
at the MC service client 1 and checks whether the criteria for the ad hoc
group emergency alert are still met. The MC service server deaffiliates the MC
service client 1 from the ad hoc group associated to the emergency alert.
2\. The MC service server sends an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request
to MC service client 1. The MC service client 1 is removed from the ad hoc
group.
3\. MC service client 1 notifies the MC service user that the emergency alert
is cancelled.
4\. The receiving MC service client 1 sends the ad hoc group emergency alert
cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge that the ad hoc group
emergency alert is cancelled for this MC service user.
5\. The authorized user on MC service client 2 is notified with the MC service
IDs of those MC service users who are currently in the ad hoc group after
removing MC service client 1 from the list.
NOTE: If a communication is ongoing in the ad hoc group for the MC service
user, the MC service server will wait to remove the MC service user from the
ad hoc group until the communication is terminated.
##### 10.10.3.3.5 Modifying the criteria for determining the participants
during an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert
During an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert, the alerting user modifies the
criteria for determining the list of participants of the ad hoc group
emergency alert. The MC service server checks whether additional MC service
users meet the modified conditions or whether other MC service users don't
meet the conditions any longer.
As illustrated in Figure 10.10.3.3.5-1 MC service client 2 is added to the ad
hoc group as the MC service client 2 meets the modified criteria for receiving
an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert, whereas MC service client 3 is
removed from the ad hoc group as the MC service client 3 does not meet the
modified criteria for receiving the ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An ad hoc group emergency alert has been initiated by MC service client 1
and the related ad hoc group exists.
2\. The MC service user on MC service client 1 is authorized to modify the
criteria for determining the list of participants by the MC service server.
Figure 10.10.3.3.5-1: Modifying the criteria for determining the participants
during an ongoing ad hoc group emergency alert
1\. The MC service user at the MC service client 1 wishes to modify the
criteria for determining the list of ad hoc group emergency alert
participants.
2\. The MC service server receives the ad hoc group emergency alert modify
request.
3\. The MC service server checks whether MC service client 1 is authorized to
modify the criteria which determines the list of ad hoc group participants.
4\. The MC service server analyses the modified criteria and identifies that
MC service client 3 does not meet the modified criteria while MC service
client 2 meets the modified criteria. The ad hoc group is updated with the
determined user list as a member of the group.4a. MC service server sends an
ad hoc group emergency alert request towards MC service client 2.
4b. The MC service user 2 is notified of entering an ongoing ad hoc group
emergency alert.
4c. MC service client 2 sends an ad hoc group emergency alert response towards
MC service server.
4d. MC service server sends an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel request
towards MC service client 3.
4e. The MC service user 3 is notified of leaving an ongoing ad hoc group
emergency alert.
4f. MC service client 3 sends an ad hoc group emergency alert cancel response
towards MC service server.
5\. The MC service server sends an ad hoc group emergency alert modify
response back to MC service client 1, which indicates whether the modify
request was successful.
6\. The MC service server adds MC service client 2 to the ad hoc group
emergency alert and removes MC service client 3 from the ad hoc group
emergency alert.
NOTE: If the ad hoc group emergency alert is associated with an ad hoc group
call and the change of criteria caused the modification of the ad hoc group
emergency alert participant list then the ongoing ad hoc group call is
modified accordingly.

## 10.11 MC service resource management (on-network)
### 10.11.1 General
The following subclauses specify the procedures for resource management for
mission critical services. The procedures are utilised by the following MC
services:
\- MCPTT (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]);
\- MCVideo (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]); and
\- MCData (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]).
The MC service server sets up media bearers and may need to modify the bearers
for an already established MC communication.
Media characteristics that may need to be modified include:
\- activation and deactivation of the bearer;
\- modification of the QoS characteristics of the bearer (e.g. bearer priority
adjustment); and
\- modification of GBR due to media codec change
NOTE 1: A group call can consist of both unicast and multicast bearers which
can all need modification due to the same event.
NOTE 2: The MC service server can retry the establishment of a media bearer
upon failure based on information received, or other conditions.
The information elements associated to the resources management procedures in
this clause are derived from the respective communication setup procedures in
3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] and 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
### 10.11.2 Request for unicast resources at session establishment -- SIP core
based
The procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are
requested at session establishment. If concurrent sessions are used the MC
service server may utilize the capability of resource sharing specified in
3GPP TS 23.203 [8]. The request for resources is sent to the PCRF on the Rx
reference point and includes media type, bandwidth, priority, application
identifier and resource sharing information.
The procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires
requests for network resources.
Procedures in figure 10.11.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
requesting resource at session establishment.
Figure 10.11.2-1: Resource request at session establishment -- SIP core based
1\. MC service client sends a session establishment request.
2\. MC service server receives evaluates the need network resources and use of
media resource sharing.
3\. MC service server send a session progress request containing request for
resources.
4\. PCC procedures (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]) initiated from SIP core
local inbound/outbound proxy over Rx.
5\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the call control
protocol request to the MC service client.
6\. The MC service client acknowledges the session progress request with an OK
message.
7\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the OK message to the
MC service server.
8\. The MC service session is established and resources have been allocated.
### 10.11.2a Request for unicast resources at session establishment -- MC
service server based
#### 10.11.2a.1 General
The procedure defined in this clause specifies how network resources are
requested at session establishment from the MC service server. The request for
resources is sent to the PCRF via the Rx reference point from the MC service
server and includes media type, bandwidth, priority, application identifier
and resource sharing information. If concurrent sessions are used, the MC
service server may utilize the capability of resource sharing specified in
3GPP TS 23.203 [8].
For the request of network resources by the MC service server via the Rx
reference point, the MC service client provides to the MC service server the
final access resource details (e.g. IP addresses and ports) of the MC service
client and the media anchoring points.
This procedure is generic to any type of session establishment with the MC
service server requesting network resources.
#### 10.11.2a.2 Procedure
Figure 10.11.2a.2-1 describes the procedure for the request of resources at
session establishment from the MC service server.
Figure 10.11.2a.2-1: Resource request at session establishment -- MC service
server based
1\. The MC service client sends a session establishment request. The request
includes, apart from the SDP offer, access resource details, e.g. IP addresses
and ports of the MC service client related to the media session.
2\. The MC service server evaluates the need of network resources and use of
media resource sharing.
3\. The MC service server sends a session progress request to the SIP core.
NOTE: The session progress request does not include a request for network
resources to be performed by the SIP core.
4\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the session progress
request to the MC service client.
5\. The MC service client acknowledges the session establishment to the MC
service server. This message contains the final negotiated media access
parameters, e.g. IP addresses and ports related to the media anchoring points
received in the SDP answer from the SIP core.
6\. The MC service server sends a request for media resources to the PCRF over
Rx (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]).
7\. The MC service session is established, and resources have been allocated.
### 10.11.3 Request for modification of unicast resources
To modify unicast media bearers, the MC service server shall send a resource
modification request containing the parameters to be modified, using the call
control protocol via the SIP core to the UE.
Possible scenarios when this procedure may be used are:
> \- Modify the allocation and retention priority for unicast resources;
>
> \- Release and resume resources in-between MC service calls when using the
> chat model; or
>
> \- Release and resume resources when a UE is able to receive the MC service
> call over multicast transmission
Releasing resources for the media plane should give the option to allow the
SIP session to either be torn down or continue.
Procedures in figure 10.11.3-1 are the signalling procedures for the
modification of a unicast:
Pre-conditions:
\- An MC service session is already in progress;
Figure 10.11.3-1: Bearer modification request
1\. MC service server decides to modify the parameters of a unicast bearer
(e.g. a request to upgrade the existing MC service call to an MC service
emergency or imminent-peril call).
2\. MC service server sends a session update which includes a resource
modification request containing the modified parameters of the unicast bearer.
3\. PCC procedures (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]) initiated from SIP core
local inbound/outbound proxy over Rx.
4\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the session update
request to the MC service client.
5\. The MC service client acknowledges the call control protocol request with
an OK message.
6\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the OK message to the
MC service server.
7\. The MC service session continues with the modified unicast resources.
NOTE 1: If the MC service call is transferred to multicast transmission, the
unicast resources could be temporarily released.
NOTE 2: If multiple audio streams are sent to the UE, additional bearer
resources could be required during an established session. Pre-allocation of
additional bearer resources already at session establishment could be useful.
### 10.11.4 Management of multicast media bearers
To activate the multicast media bearers the MC service server shall use the
Activate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18] with the MC
service server performing the GCS AS function. The MC service server shall
activate MBMS bearers in broadcast areas where eMBMS capable UEs are or are
expected to be located. For that, the MC service server shall use the MBMS
SAI(s) and/or cell id(s) information to construct the MBMS broadcast area
parameter in the Activate MBMS Bearer procedure.
To deactivate the multicast media bearers the MC service server shall use the
Deactivate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18] with the MC
service server performing the GCS AS function.
To modify multicast media bearers the MC service server shall use the Modify
MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18] with the MC service
server performing the GCS AS function.
### 10.11.5 Request for resources with shared priority
#### 10.11.5.1 General
An MC service server that supports simultaneous sessions may need to share a
common priority on the EPS bearer for several MC service group calls that may
use different priorities on the application level. This is achieved by
including information for priority sharing on the request of resources over Rx
reference point to PCRF. All sessions associated with the same priority
sharing information will be handled by one EPS bearer, which will have a
priority based on the highest requested priority among the sessions.
The use of the procedure defined in subclause 10.11.5.2 is dependent on
operator policy.
#### 10.11.5.2 Procedure
Pre-conditions:
\- All previous resource requests from the MC service have included a priority
sharing information.
Figure 10.11.5.2-1: Resource request including priority sharing information
1\. The MC service server decides based on a request from the MC service
client that the priority of an ongoing call must be adjusted.
2\. The MC service server requests a session update to the SIP core. This
request will contain information of priority sharing.
3\. PCC update procedures (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]) initiated from
SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy over Rx. PCC updates the bearer priority
for the bearer that contains the SDFs associated with the same priority
sharing information. The priority is set to highest priority (lowest ARP)
among those SDFs. No additional bearer is created. Also, the default bearer
priority is updated accordingly.
4\. The session update is forwarded to the MC service client.
NOTE 1: The procedure defined above requires a PCC enhancement and is subject
to implementation in EPC and IMS and can therefore only be used if supported
by EPC and IMS.
NOTE 2: If the EPC and IMS does not support the priority sharing from MC
system, no shared priority treatment applies, and a new EPS bearer will be
setup based on QCI/ARP combination.
### 10.11.6 Request for media resources from MC service server
#### 10.11.6.1 General
The procedure in this sub clause specify how request for resource for floor
control (or transmission control in MCVideo and MCData) and for the media
plane can be handled independently. This procedure utilizes the Rx reference
point both between from the MC service server to the PCRF and from the SIP
core to the PCRF.
Resource for the transmission control is requested at session establishment,
in this case the IMS standard procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9]
are used. The session description shall in this procedure include bandwidth
information applicable for the transmission control traffic requirement. At
group call setup the request for resources for the media plane is triggered.
This request is sent directly from the MC service server to the PCRF.
The procedure is optional and is suitable when the procedures for pre-
established sessions are used, it may also be used to setup and tear down the
media plane used by between consecutive group calls in one communication
session using the chat call model.
#### 10.11.6.2 Procedure
The figure below illustrates the procedure for resource reservation
Figure 10.11.6.2-1: Request for resources for transmission control and media
plane
1\. The MC service client sends a request for group affiliation.
2\. The MC service client sends a request to the MC service server for
establishment of a communication session.
3\. The MC service server answer the session establishment request and adjust
the bandwidth information in the session description. The requested bandwidth
shall be minimized to cover the bandwidth requirements for floor control
signaling (or transmission control for MCVideo or MCData).
4\. The SIP core request resources towards the PCRF according to the session
establishment request.5. The session establishment request is completed and a
response is sent towards the MC service client.
6\. The MC service client sends a cell setup message according to existing
procedures.
7\. The MC service server sends a session establishment request for resources
for the media plane to PCRF, and the media plane is by that established. This
request includes media description relevant for the media plane.
8\. Group call is ongoing on the group communication session.
9\. The MC service serve sends a release of media resources to PCRF, and the
media plane is by that terminated.
10\. The PCRF performs session termination procedure according to 3GPP TS
23.203 [8].
11\. The PCRF sends a session release response back to the MC service server.
NOTE 1: The resources for transmission control are retained.
NOTE 2: Step 6-9 can be repeated several times within the life cycle of one
communication session.
## 10.12 Priority Management
### 10.12.1 General
Mission critical priority and QoS management is situational. The MC Services
provides a real-time priority and QoS experience for the MC users, who have
significant dynamic operational requirements that determine their priority.
For example, the type of incident a responder is serving or the responder\'s
overall shift role needs to strongly influence a user\'s ability to obtain
resources from the LTE system.
Priority treatment applies on both application layer as well as on transport
layer. The details on how the priority level is evaluated and used is outside
the scope of this specification. What is specified is the necessary mechanisms
to apply the priority and QoS and map different priority parameters between
different entities, for example to map application layer priority to transport
layer priority.
One of the requirements for MC communication services is to coordinate the use
of priority levels between the different MC service servers. This priority
coordination is used to mitigate and manage the risk for network congestion
situations.
### 10.12.2 Information flows
#### 10.12.2.1 MC priority request
Table 10.12.1.1-1 describes the information flow MC priority request from one
MC service server to an MC service server taking the priority arbitration
role.
Table 10.12.1.1-1: MC priority request
* * *
Information element Status Description Priority M Requested priority Priority
area M The geographical area for which the requested priority is required.
Type of service O The MC service type e.g. MCVideo, MCPTT or MCData
* * *
### 10.12.3 Procedure for priority coordination between multiple MC service
servers
In deployment scenarios with multiple MC service servers of different or the
same type it is required to coordinate the priorities used by the different
servers. The procedure defined below provides the necessary coordination
between MC service servers to manage high priority levels. One of the involved
MC service servers is assigned the role of being a priority arbitrator among a
group of MC service servers serving the same geographical area. The priority
arbitrator may also compete for the same limited network resources. Prior to
using this procedure all MC service servers need to be configured with
information about which MC service server will act as the priority arbitrator
and under what conditions (e.g. priority level) the priority arbitrator should
be used. The use of this procedure is not mandated. MC systems that support
priority coordination between multiple MC service servers should support this
procedure.
Pre-condition:
> 1\. One of the MC service servers is assigned the role of the priority
> arbitrator.
2\. It is assumed that all MC service servers are part of the same trusted
domain.
3\. A MC communication session is ongoing or is about to commence. The
operational situation together with static and dynamic attributes requires the
use of elevated priority for network resources.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS if enforcement of the granted priority can be
applied to MC service servers outside of the same trusted domain
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how the MC service server 2 (priority arbitrator)
knows about ongoing traffic.
Figure 10.12.3-1: Priority arbitration between multiple MC service servers
1\. A need for high priority level is identified by the MC service server 1.
The priority level identified is above the level of priority that the MC
service server 1 can utilise without centralized priority arbitration.
2\. The MC service server 1 sends a MC priority request to the MC service
server being assigned the priority arbitrator role. The request includes the
geographical area, duration, the priority level, service type and needed
capacity.
3\. The priority arbitrator determines whether to grant, reject or queue the
request for elevated priority.
NOTE 1: How the priority arbitrator makes this determination is out of scope
of the present document.
NOTE 2: One source of information for the priority arbitrator to evaluate the
priority request, could be information received at the resource reservations
over the Rx reference point. Example of such information is resource request
failure and Retry-Interval AVP which could be an indication of RAN user plane
congestion, see reference 3GPP TS 29.214 [27].
4\. The priority arbitrator grants MC service server 1 the elevated priority
5\. The priority arbitrator notifies other MC service servers about the
elevated priority granted to other services.
NOTE 3: The behaviour of the MC service servers that receive this information
is implementation specific. The MC service server may take this information
into account when performing priority evaluations for the MC service clients
managed by this MC service server.
6\. The MC service server utilizes the elevated priority when requesting
resources for new or existing MC service communication.
NOTE 4: The priority level granted to the MC service server 1 can be mapped to
an applicable SIP priority header or a reservation priority AVP (when the MC
service server use the Rx reference point directly).
7a-c. A priority notification may be sent to the MC service clients in the
geographical area in which the priority was granted. Messages to MC service
clients need to be sent from the MC service server serving each MC user. This
message is preferably sent over a multicast bearer.
Editor\'s note: How the clients could utilize such notifications is FFS.
8\. The MC service server 1 identifies that the elevated priority is not
needed.
9\. The requested MC Priority is released from the MC service server 1.
10\. The MC service server 2 (priority arbitrator) informs other MC servers
that the elevated priority is released.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS to include procedure for MC priority revoking.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS to include procedure for MC priority queueing.

### 10.13.3 Authorised MC service user retrieves active functional alias(es)
for certain MC service user(s)
An authorised MC service user can request the active functional alias(es) for
one or more MC service users.
Figure 10.13.3-1 below illustrates the active functional alias list query for
the MC service user(s).
Figure 10.13.3-1: Active functional alias list query for the user
1\. The MC service client of the MC service user requests the list(s) of
active functional aliases for each MC service user(s) from the MC service
server by sending an active functional alias information user query request.
The MC service ID(s) to be queried is included.
2\. The MC service server checks whether the MC service user is authorized to
perform the query. If authorized, then the MC service server retrieves the
requested active functional alias information based on the MC service ID(s).
3\. The MC service server sends an active functional alias information user
query response including the functional alias information to the MC service
client.
### 10.13.4 MC service user activates functional alias(es) within an MC system
The procedure for MC service user activates functional alias(es) within an MC
system is illustrated in figure 10.13.4-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client has already been provisioned (statically or dynamically)
with the functional alias(es) information that the MC service client is
allowed to activate.
2\. MC service server may have retrieved the user profile and functional alias
policy from the functional alias configuration e.g. which user(s) are
authorized to activate to what functional alias, priority, and other
configuration data.
3\. MC service client may have indicated to the functional alias management
server that it wishes to receive updates of functional alias data for the
functional aliases for which it is authorized.
4\. The MC service client triggers the functional alias activation procedure.
This is an explicit activation caused either by the MC service user or
determined by a trigger event such as the MC service UE coming within a
permitted geographic operational area of a functional alias.
Figure 10.13.4-1: Functional alias activation procedure within an MC system
1\. MC service client of the MC service user requests the MC service server to
activate a functional alias or a set of functional aliases.
NOTE 1: If the MC service server is not the one that performs the functional
alias controlling role, the MC service server will forward the request to the
MC service server that performs the functional alias controlling role.
2\. The MC service server checks if there are any conflicts with active
functional alias(es).
3\. If the user of the MC service client is authorised to activate the
requested functional alias(es) then the MC service server stores the
functional alias(es) status of the requested functional alias(es).
If a certain functional alias(es) can be simultaneously active for multiple MC
service users and the upper limit of number of simultaneous MC service users
is not reached, the MC service shall activate the functional alias(es) for the
MC service user and inform all other MC service user(s) with sharing the same
functional alias(es) (step 5). If the limit of number of simultaneous MC
service users is reached or the functional alias is not allowed to be shared,
the request is rejected and the MC service user is notified (step 4).
If the functional alias(es) is (are) already used by another MC service
user(s), an authorized MC service user gets an offer to take over the
functional alias from the MC service user currently using the functional
alias(es).
NOTE 2: The functional alias status is notified to other servers (e.g. MC
service servers) within the MC system that have subscribed to functional alias
status.
4\. MC service server sends a functional alias(es) activation response to the
MC service client.
5\. The MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) sharing the
same functional alias(es).
### 10.13.5 MC service user de-activates functional alias(es) within an MC
system
The procedure for MC service user de-activates functional alias(es) within an
MC system is illustrated in figure 10.13.5-1.
When an MC service user does not want to use a functional alias(es) anymore,
then the MC service user can de-activate functional alias(es).
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service server has already subscribed to the functional alias(es)
information from the functional alias management server and has stored the
data of the functional alias(es) a MC service user has activated.
2\. The MC service client triggers the functional alias(es) de-activation
procedure. This is an explicit de-activation request either by the MC service
user or determined by a trigger event such as the MC service UE moving outside
a permitted geographic operational area of a functional alias.
Figure 10.13.5-1: Functional alias de-activation procedure within an MC system
1\. MC service client requests the MC service server to de-activate a
functional alias or a set of functional aliases.
NOTE 1: If the MC service server is not the one that performs the functional
alias controlling role, the MC service server will forward the request to the
MC service server that performs the functional alias controlling role.
2\. Based on the MC service user profile and stored functional alias policy
from the functional alias configuration, the MC service server checks if the
MC service user of the MC service client is authorized to de-activate from the
requested functional alias(es) and if the MC service user of the MC service
client has activated to the requested functional alias(es).
3\. If the MC service user is authorized to de-activate from the requested
functional alias(es) then the MC service server updates the functional alias
activation status of the MC service user.
NOTE 2: The functional alias status is notified to other servers (e.g. MC
service servers) within the MC system that have subscribed to functional alias
status.
4\. MC service server provides to the MC service client the functional alias
de-activation response.
5\. The MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) sharing the
same functional alias(es).
### 10.13.6 Authorised MC service user takes over functional alias(es) within
an MC system
The procedure for MC service user takes over functional alias(es) within an MC
system is illustrated in figure 10.13.6-1.
During functional alias(es) activation, if the functional alias(es) is (are)
already used by another MC service user(s), an authorized MC service user may
get an offer to take over the functional alias(es) from the MC service user
currently using the functional alias(es).
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client 1 has performed the functional alias(es) activation
procedure as described in subclause 10.13.4.
2\. As result of the functional alias(es) activation procedure, the MC service
user of MC service client 1 is aware which functional alias(es) are already
used but can be taken over.
3\. The MC service user of MC service client 1 decides to take over a
functional alias.
Figure 10.13.6-1: Functional alias taking over procedure within an MC system
1\. MC service client 1 of the MC service user 1 requests the MC service
server to take over a functional alias by sending a functional alias take over
request.
NOTE 1: If the MC service server is not the one that performs the functional
alias controlling role, the MC service server will forward the request to the
MC service server that performs the functional alias controlling role.
NOTE 2: For the sake of brevity takeover of single functional alias is shown
in this procedure. If MC service user 1 decides to take over multiple
functional aliases, then the Functional alias take over request in step 1
carries a list of those functional aliases.
2\. The MC service server checks if there are any conflicts taking over the
functional alias.
3\. If the user of the MC service client 1 is authorised to take over the
requested functional alias then the MC service server sends a functional alias
revoke notification to inform MC service client 2 that the functional alias
has been revoked and is not any longer active for the user of MC service
client 2.
4\. The MC service server stores the functional alias status of the requested
functional alias.
NOTE 3: The functional alias status is notified to other servers (e.g. MC
service servers) within the MC system that have subscribed to functional alias
status.
5\. MC service server sends a functional alias take over response to the MC
service client.
6\. The MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) sharing the
same functional alias.
### 10.13.7 Authorised MC service user retrieves MC service user(s) for
certain active functional alias(es)
An authorised MC service user can request the MC service user(s) who have
activated the functional alias being queried, for one or more functional
aliases.
Figure 10.13.7-1 below illustrates the query of usage of the active functional
alias(es) procedure.
Figure 10.13.7-1: Query of usage of the active functional alias(es)
1\. The MC service client of the MC service user requests the list(s) of MC
service user(s) who have actived the functional alias being queried, by
sending an active functional alias information usage query request. The
functional alias(es) to be queried are included.
2\. The MC service server checks whether the MC service user is authorized to
perform the query. If authorized, then the MC service server retrieves the
requested MC service user(s) information for those MC service users who have
actived the functional alias being queried.
3\. The MC service server sends an active functional alias information usage
query response including the MC service user information to the MC service
client.
10.13.8 Automatic activation of functional alias(es) within an MC system
The MC Service Server can automatically activate functional aliases that can
be specified by internal or external triggers such as location dependency,
schedule, or timer.
The procedure for automatic activation of functional alias(es) within an MC
system is illustrated in figure 10.13.8-1. The MC service client(s) get(s)
notified by the MC service server at the time when a functional alias has been
activated by the MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service server may have retrieved the MC service user profile and
functional alias policy from the functional alias configuration, for example,
which MC service user(s) are authorized to activate which functional
alias(es), to use corresponding priorities and other configuration data
associated with the functional alias.
2\. MC service server has already been provisioned with the functional
alias(es) information that the MC service client is allowed to activate.
Figure 10.13.8-1: Automatic functional alias activation within an MC system
1\. The condition e.g. timer or current location of the MC service user for
automatic functional alias(es) activation is met.
2\. The MC service server checks if there are any conflicts with current
active functional alias(es).
a.) If a certain functional alias(es) can be simultaneously active for
multiple MC service users and the upper limit of simultaneous MC service users
is not reached, the MC service server shall activate the functional alias(es)
for the corresponding MC service user and inform all other MC service user(s)
that are sharing the same functional alias(es) (step 5).
b.) If the limit of simultaneous MC service users is reached or the functional
alias is not allowed to be shared then the MC service server does not proceed
with the functional alias(es) activation procedure or the MC service server
can reassign the functional alias, i.e. takeover, from the MC service user
currently using the functional alias(es) to the new MC service client.
3\. MC service server notifies the MC service client about the activation of
the functional alias(es).
4\. The MC service server stores the functional alias(es) status for the
functional alias(es), including date and time of activation.
5\. The MC service server informs all other MC service user(s) sharing the
same functional alias(es).
10.13.9 Automatic deactivation of functional alias(es) within an MC system

### 10.13.11 Functional alias to group binding
#### 10.13.11.1 General
The MC service client creates a functional alias to group binding association
to be stored within the group controlling MC server. Once a functional alias
is bound to a group it is bound till the functional alias is unbound to the
group. After an MC service log-off the user\'s functional alias to group
bindings are deleted.
NOTE: Affiliation and de-affiliation procedures do not change the functional
alias to group binding.

groups which are not used for communications within those groups anymore.
2\. The group controlling MC service server provides a functional alias to
group unbinding response to the MC service client indicating success or
failure of the request. The MC service server also checks whether the MC
service client is the last client who has bound a certain functional alias to
a group which may prevent unbinding that functional alias from the group.
## 10.14 Generic procedures for interconnection
### 10.14.1 General
Interconnection provides a means for communication between different MC
systems with differing levels of trust between those MC systems. This
subclause describes generic procedures for interconnection which are
variations of specific procedures detailed in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16] and 3GPP TS
23.281 [12]. These procedures should be read in conjunction with specific
procedures in those specifications.
### 10.14.2 Generic call procedure with topology hiding
#### 10.14.2.1 General
The procedure in this subclause applies to MC service group calls and private
calls made between multiple MC systems where topology hiding is required. An
MC gateway server in an MC system is used to route calls to and from partner
MC systems, and by doing so hides the topology of the MC system.
#### 10.14.2.2 Procedure for calls with topology hiding
Figure 10.14.2.2-1 shows the procedure where an MC service client initiates an
MC service group call to an MC service group where the primary MC system of
that MC service group is an interconnected MC system, or where an MC service
client initiates an MC service private call to an MC service user where the
primary MC system of that MC service user is an interconnected partner MC
system. In this procedure, both MC systems make use of topology hiding.
NOTE 1: This procedure does not illustrate the case where the target MC
service client has migrated, and where further forwarding of the call request
is required.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client 1 is receiving MC service in a different MC system to
the primary MC system of the target MC service group or MC service user, and
the MC systems are interconnected.
NOTE 2: MC service client 1 may be receiving service in the primary MC system
of MC service client 1, or may have successfully migrated to a partner MC
system.
2\. If the call to be originated by MC service client 1 is an MC service group
call, MC service client 1 has affiliated to the MC service group.
3\. If the call to be originated by MC service client 1 is an MC service
private call, the target MC service client, MC service client 2, is receiving
service from the primary MC system of that MC service client.
Figure 10.14.2.2-1: Call to target in interconnected MC system
1\. MC service client 1 initiates a call request to a target MC service user
or MC service group, where the primary MC system of that MC service user or MC
service group is an interconnected partner MC system.
2\. The serving MC service server of MC service client 1 determines that the
call has a target in a different MC system, and that the MC gateway server is
the correct next hop for the call.
3\. The serving MC service server of MC service client 1 forwards the call
request to the MC gateway server of the serving MC system.
4\. The MC gateway server identifies the correct partner MC system which is
the primary MC system for the target of the call.
NOTE 3: The MC gateway server of the serving MC system of MC service client 1
will contain configuration to allow it to route the call request over the
signalling plane to the MC gateway server in the partner MC system.
5\. The MC gateway server of the primary MC system of MC service client 1
forwards the call request to the MC gateway server of the partner MC system.
6\. The MC gateway server of the partner MC system determines the MC service
server which is the primary MC service server for the target MC service user
or MC service group.
NOTE 4: The MC gateway server of the partner MC system will contain
configuration allowing it to make use of the target MC service ID or MC
service group ID to identify the primary MC service server of the target MC
service user or MC service group.
7\. The call request is forwarded to the partner MC service server which is
the primary MC service server of the target MC service user or MC service
group.
8\. The partner MC service server which is the primary MC service server of
the target MC service user or MC service group checks that the call is
authorized to be made. The authorization process checks that the call origin
is permissible (i.e. from the serving MC system of calling MC service user,
and from that calling MC service user) for a call to the target MC service
user or MC service group.
9\. Providing that the authorization in step 8 is successful, the call request
is sent to MC service client 2.
10\. MC service client 2 sends a call response to the call request.
11\. The partner MC service server, which is the primary MC service server of
the target MC service user or MC service group, sends a call response to the
MC gateway server in the partner MC system.
12\. The MC gateway server in the partner MC system sends the call response to
the MC gateway server in the primary MC system of MC service client 1.
13\. The MC gateway server in the primary MC system sends the call response to
the serving MC service server of MC service client 1.
14\. The serving MC service server sends the call response to MC service
client 1.
NOTE 5. Steps 9 and 10 may occur at any time after step 8 and prior to step
15, provided that step 9 always take place before step 10. If the
authorization in step 8 has failed, then steps 9 and 10 do not occur.
15.If the call response was successful, floor control and media paths are
established for the call.
### 10.14.3 Generic call procedure for enforcement of local MC service group
configuration
#### 10.14.3.1 General
The procedure in the following subclauses apply to MC service group calls made
between multiple MC systems where the partner MC system applies local
configuration to the MC service group configuration which has been provided by
the primary MC system of the MC service group. The serving MC server of the MC
service group members, that is a participating server for the MC service
group, applies enforcement of local MC service group configuration.
#### 10.14.3.2 MC service group call initiated in the partner MC system of the
MC service group
Figure 10.14.3.2-1 shows the procedure where an MC service group call is
initiated by an MC service client receiving MC service in the partner MC
system of the MC service group.
NOTE 1: Any topology hiding by the primary or partner MC system of the MC
service group is not shown within this procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client 1 is receiving MC service in a partner MC system of the
MC service group, and the MC systems are interconnected.
NOTE 2: MC service client 1 can be receiving service in the primary MC system
of MC service client 1, or can have successfully migrated to a partner MC
system.
2\. MC service client 1 has affiliated to the MC service group.
Figure 10.14.3.2-1: Enforcement of local configuration with call originated in
partner MC system of MC service group
1\. MC service client 1 initiates a group call request to the MC service
group, where the primary MC system of that MC service group is an
interconnected partner MC system.
2\. The serving MC service server of MC service client 1 authorizes the group
call request using local group configuration information.
3\. If the group call request authorization by the serving MC service server
of MC service client 1 is successful, the serving MC service server forwards
the group call request to the group host MC service server in the primary MC
system of the MC service group.
4\. The primary MC service server of the MC service group checks that the call
is authorized to be made. The authorization process checks that the call
origin is permissible (i.e. from the serving MC system of calling MC service
user, and from that calling MC service user) for a call to that MC service
group.
5\. Providing that authorization in step 4 is successful, the group call
response is sent to the serving MC service server of MC service client 1.
6\. The serving MC service server sends the MC service group call response to
MC service client 1.
7\. Floor control or transmission control and media paths are established for
the MC service group call.
#### 10.14.3.3 MC service group call request received from the primary MC
system of the MC service group
Figure 10.14.3.3-1 shows the procedure where an MC service group call request
is received from the primary MC system of the MC service group, which includes
an MC service group member MC service client 1 that is receiving service
within the partner MC system of the MC service group. Any topology hiding by
the primary or partner MC system of the MC service group is not shown within
this procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client 1 is receiving MC service in a partner MC system of the
MC service group, and the MC systems are interconnected.
NOTE: MC service client 1 can be receiving service in the primary MC system of

### 10.15.3 Regroup with preconfigured group
#### 10.15.3.1 General
A group regroup may be achieved by regrouping MC service groups into a new MC
service regroup group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured
MC service group. The MC service regroup group configuration needs to be
provided to the relevant MC service group members of the MC service groups
that will be regrouped in advance of the regrouping operation.
A user regroup may be achieved by regrouping MC service users into a new MC
service regroup group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured
MC service group. The MC service regroup group configuration needs to be
provided to the relevant MC service users who will be regrouped in advance of
the regrouping operation.
NOTE 1: A preconfigured group which is intended only to provide configuration
for the preconfigured regroup process is identified by a parameter in group
configuration described in this specification.
NOTE 2: The configuration may alternatively be taken from any MC service group
that has been configured in the user profile of all the relevant MC service
users who will be regrouped.
NOTE 3: Regroup groups may be defined according to the organizational
structure of a mission critical organization, or by some other means which
allows the MC service client of an authorized user to be aware of an
appropriate regroup group for sets of MC service groups or MC service users
that will be regrouped together.
The preconfigured MC service group that provides the configuration is not used
as the MC service regroup group itself, it only provides configuration for one
or more MC service regroup groups. The MC service group ID of the regroup
group is provided by the authorized user when the preconfigured regrouping is
carried out.
The MC service regroup group can be specified to be a broadcast or non-
broadcast type according to the configuration of the MC service group whose
configuration is specified by the regroup request. The broadcast type of
regroup is used for one-way communication where only an authorized MC service
user is allowed to transmit and all other regroup members are only allowed to
receive the communication (e.g. a call from a dispatcher to all regroup
members). The non-broadcast type is used for two-way communication where all
regroup members can transmit and receive (i.e, the regroup group call behaves
like a normal non-broadcast group call).
For group regrouping, if the MC service server has been notified by the group
management server that one of the MC service groups that has been requested
for regrouping by means of these procedures has already been regrouped, the MC
service server shall reject the request for regrouping described in the
following procedures.
#### 10.15.3.2 Preconfigured regroup procedures in a single MC system
The following subclauses define group and user regroup procedures using
preconfigured groups within a single MC system.
##### 10.15.3.2.1 Preconfigured Group Regroup formation in a single MC system
Figure 10.15.3.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a group regroup
using a preconfigured MC service group. The procedure takes place prior to the
establishment of a group call to the MC service regroup group.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service client 2 is an affiliated member of MC service group 1 and MC
service client 3 is an affiliated member of MC service group 2.
\- The MC service group identity and group configuration for the preconfigured
MC service group have been preconfigured in MC service clients 2 and 3, and MC
service clients 2 and 3 have received the relevant security related
information to allow them to communicate in the MC service regroup group.
\- MC service client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured group regroup
procedure.
\- MC service client 1 is aware of a suitable MC service group whose
configuration has been preconfigured in the MC service UEs of the group
members who will be regrouped.
\- In order to be aware whether a group is currently regrouped, the MC service
server is subscribed to the group configuration in the GMS.
\- The GMS has subscribed to group dynamic data from the MC service server
using the procedures defined in subclause 10.1.5.6.
Figure 10.15.3.2.1-1: Regroup procedure using preconfigured group in a single
MC system
1\. The authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the group regroup
procedure, specifying the list of MC service groups to be regrouped (MC
service groups 1 and 2), the MC service group ID of the regroup group and the
MC service group ID of the group from which configuration information for the
regroup group is to be taken.
2\. MC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MC
service server.
3\. The MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to
initiate a preconfigured group regroup procedure, and resolves the group
identities of the MC service groups requested in step 1. The MC service server
also checks which group members are affiliated to MC service groups 1 and 2.
The MC service server may retrieve the configuration for the regroup group
from the GMS if that configuration information is not already known to the MC
service server. The MC service server also checks that none of the MC service
groups that are requested for regrouping are already regrouped by any
mechanism.
NOTE 1: This procedure does not require that that the authorized user of MC
service client 1 is a group member of MC service groups 1 or 2, or that the
authorized user of MC service client 1 is an affiliated group member of MC
service groups 1 or 2.
NOTE 2: The list of groups included in the group regroup is held in dynamic
data in the MC service server, and is not used to update group configuration
information in the group management server.
4\. If the MC service server determines that any of the groups requested for
regrouping, including the regroup group, have been regrouped by other group
regrouping procedures, the MC service server then sends a preconfigured
regroup reject back to MC service client 1 with a reject reason indicating
that one of the groups has already been regrouped, and this procedure
terminates.
5\. If the preconfigured regroup request is not rejected, the MC service
server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to MC service clients 2 and 3
in steps 5a and 5b respectively.
NOTE 3: Only group members that are affiliated to the MC service groups that
are to be regrouped are sent a preconfigured regroup request.
6\. MC service clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the regrouping in steps
6a and 6b respectively.
7\. MC service clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup response to
the MC service server to acknowledge the regrouping action. These
acknowledgements are not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the
preconfigured regroup request.
8\. The MC service server affiliates the regrouped MC service clients to the
regroup group.
9\. The MC service server sends a preconfigured regroup response to MC service
client 1.
After the group regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect until
explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.15.3.2.3.
MC service client participation in the ongoing regroup persists until the MC
service client is no longer affiliated to any of the regrouped groups (group 1
or 2 in this procedure).
MC service client affiliation to the regroup group may cease when the UE\'s MC
service ceases, e.g. when the UE is powered down, or by performing a log-off
operation.
Editor\'s note: Data persistence in the MC service client following a user
log-off or power down needs further study.
##### 10.15.3.2.2 Preconfigured User Regroup formation in a single MC system
Figure 10.15.3.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a user regroup
procedure using a preconfigured MC service group. The procedure takes place
prior to the establishment of a group call to the MC service regroup group.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients 2 and 3 are registered with the MC service server.
\- The MC service group identity and group configuration for the preconfigured
MC service group have been preconfigured in MC service clients 2 and 3, and MC
service clients 2 and 3 have received the relevant security related
information to allow them to communicate in the MC service regroup group.
\- MC service client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured user regroup
procedure.
\- MC service client 1 is aware of a suitable preconfigured group whose
configuration has been preconfigured in the MC service UEs of the MC service
users who will be regrouped.
Figure 10.15.3.2.2-1: User regroup procedure using preconfigured group in a
single MC system
1\. The authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the user regroup
procedure, specifying the list of MC service users to be regrouped (MC service
clients 2 and 3), the MC service group ID of the regroup group, and the MC
service group ID of the group from which configuration information for the
regroup group is to be taken. Alternatively, the MC service client 1 can
provide the criteria which allows the MC service server to determine the list
of MC service users to be regrouped.
2\. MC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MC
service server.
3\. The MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to
initiate a preconfigured user regroup procedure.
NOTE 1: MC service clients can be involved in multiple user and group regroups
simultaneously.
4\. The MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to MC
service clients 2 and 3 in steps 4a and 4b respectively.
NOTE 2: When using multicast, the MC service server can periodically
rebroadcast the preconfigured regroup request.
5\. MC service clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the regrouping in steps
5a and 5b respectively.
6\. MC service clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup response to
the MC service server to acknowledge the regrouping action. These
acknowledgements are not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the
preconfigured regroup request.
7\. The MC service server affiliates the regrouped MC service clients to the
regroup group.
8\. The MC service server sends a preconfigured regroup response to MC service
client 1.
NOTE 3: After the user regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect
until explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.15.3.2.3.
##### 10.15.3.2.3 Preconfigured regroup cancellation in a single MC system
Figure 10.15.3.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure to cancel a group or user
regroup that uses a preconfigured MC service group.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients 2 and 3 have been regrouped into a MC service regroup
group that uses the configuration of a preconfigured MC service group.
\- MC service client 1 is authorized to cancel a group or user regroup that
uses a preconfigured MC service group.
\- The GMS has subscribed to group dynamic data from the MC service server
using the procedures defined in subclause 10.1.5.6.
Figure 10.15.3.2.3-1: Cancel preconfigured regroup procedure in a single MC
system
1\. The authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the cancellation of
the regrouping that uses a preconfigured MC service group.
2\. MC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to the
MC service server, specifying the MC service group ID of the regroup group.
3\. The MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to
cancel a regrouping that used a regroup procedure with preconfigured groups.
4\. The MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to MC
service clients 2 and 3 (steps 4a and 4b respectively).
5\. MC service clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the cancellation of the
regrouping in steps 5a and 5b respectively.
6\. MC service clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup cancel
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the cancellation of the
regrouping function. These acknowledgements are not sent in response to a
multicast transmission of the preconfigured regroup cancel request.
7\. The MC service server deaffiliates MC service clients 2 and 3 from the MC
service regroup group.
8\. The MC service server sends a preconfigured regroup cancel response to MC
service client 1.
#### 10.15.3.3 Preconfigured regroup procedures in multiple MC systems
The following subclauses define group and user regroup procedures using
preconfigured groups in multiple MC systems.
##### 10.15.3.3.1 Preconfigured Group Regroup formation in multiple MC systems
Figure 10.15.3.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a group regroup
procedure using a preconfigured MC service group, where at least one of the
groups to be regrouped is configured in a partner MC system. The primary MC
system where the preconfigured group regrouping is initiated does not need to
be aware of the list of group members belonging to groups whose group home
system is the partner MC system. If the group management server in the primary
MC system of the MC service regroup group shares the necessary security
related parameters together with the group configuration of the preconfigured
MC service group with the group management server in the partner MC system and
the group management server in the partner MC system distributes this
configuration including those security parameters to its served MC service
users according to the procedures in subclause 10.2.7, the primary MC system
does not need to be aware of the list of group members of the MC service
regroup group that are receiving service in the partner MC system.
The procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the MC
service regroup group.
In this procedure, any gateway MC servers in the primary or partner MC systems
are not shown.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service client 1 is authorized to initiated a preconfigured regroup
procedure, and is receiving MC service in the primary MC system of MC service
client 1.
\- MC service client 2 is an affiliated member of MC service group 1 where MC
service group 1 is defined in the partner MC system and MC service client 2 is
receiving service in the partner MC system of MC service client 1.
\- The MC service group identity and group configuration for the preconfigured
MC service group have been preconfigured in MC service client 2, and MC
service client 2 has received the relevant security related information to
allow communication in the MC service regroup group.
\- In order to be aware whether the group is regrouped, the MC service server
is subscribed to the group configuration in the GMS.
\- The GMS has subscribed to group dynamic data from the MC service server
within the same MC system using the procedures defined in subclause 10.1.5.6
Figure 10.15.3.3.1-1: Group regroup procedure using preconfigured group in
multiple MC systems
1\. The authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the group regroup
procedure, specifying the list of MC service groups to be regrouped including
MC service group 1, the MC service group ID of the regroup group and the MC
service group ID of the group from which configuration information for the
regroup group is to be taken.
2\. MC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MC
service server.
3\. The MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to
initiate a preconfigured group regroup procedure, and resolves the group
identities of the MC service groups requested in step 1. The MC service server
also checks which group members are affiliated to the requested MC service
groups that are homed in the primary MC system. The MC service server
identifies any partner systems which are the group home systems for MC service
groups identified in the list of groups to be regrouped. The MC service server
may retrieve the configuration for the regroup group from the GMS if that
configuration information is not already known to the MC service server. The
MC service server also checks that none of the MC service groups that are
homed in the primary MC system and that are requested for regrouping are
already regrouped by any mechanism.
NOTE 1: This procedure does not require that that the authorized user of MC
service client 1 is a group member of the MC service groups listed in the
regroup request, or that the authorized user of MC service client 1 is an
affiliated group member of any of the listed MC service groups.
4\. The MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to the MC
service server in the partner MC system.
5\. The partner MC service server checks the status of any MC service groups
hosted by that partner MC service server, and identifies affiliated group
members of any of the identified MC service groups (both MC service groups
that are hosted in the primary MC system and MC service groups that are hosted
in the partner MC system) that are receiving MC service service in the partner
MC system, which include MC service client 2.
6\. The partner MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup request to
MC service client 2.
NOTE 2: Only group members that are affiliated to the MC service groups that
are to be regrouped are sent a preconfigured regroup request.
7\. MC service client 2 notifies the user of the regrouping.
8\. MC service client 2 may send the preconfigured regroup response to the
partner MC service server to acknowledge the regrouping action. This
acknowledgement is not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the
preconfigured regroup request.
9\. The partner MC service server affiliates the regrouped MC service client 2
to the regroup group.
10\. The partner MC service server sends a preconfigured regroup response to
the primary MC service server.
11\. The primary MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup response to
MC service client 1.
After the group regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect until
explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.15.3.3.3.
MC service client participation in the ongoing regroup persists until the MC
service client is no longer affiliated to any of the regrouped groups (group 1
or 2 in this procedure).
MC service client affiliation to the regroup group may cease when the UE\'s MC
service ceases, e.g. when the UE is powered down, or by performing a log-off
operation.
Editor\'s note: Data persistence in the MC service client following a user
log-off or power down needs further study.
##### 10.15.3.3.2 Preconfigured User Regroup formation in multiple MC systems
Figure 10.15.3.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a user regroup
procedure using a preconfigured MC service group, where at least one of the MC
service users to be regrouped is homed in a partner MC system. It is assumed
that the group management server in the primary MC system of the MC service
regroup group shares the necessary security related parameters together with
the group configuration of the preconfigured MC service group with the group
management server in the partner MC system and the group management server in
the partner MC system distributes this configuration including those security
parameters to its served MC service users according to the procedures in
subclause 10.2.7.
The procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the MC
service regroup group.
In this procedure, any gateway MC servers in the primary or partner MC systems
are not shown.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service client 1 is homed in the primary MC system and is receiving
service in the primary MC system.
\- MC service client 2 is homed in the partner MC system and is receiving
service in the partner MC service system of MC client 1.

until explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.15.3.3.3.
##### 10.15.3.3.3 Preconfigured regroup cancellation in multiple MC systems
Figure 10.15.3.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure to cancel a group or user
regroup that uses a preconfigured MC service group where multiple MC systems
were involved in the regrouping.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service client 2 has been regrouped into the MC service regroup group,
and is receiving service in the partner MC system of the regroup group.
\- MC service client 1 is authorized to cancel a regrouping that uses a
preconfigured MC service group, and is receiving service in the primary MC
system of the regroup group.
\- The GMS has subscribed to group dynamic data from the MC service server
within the same MC system using the procedures defined in subclause 10.1.5.6.
Figure 10.15.3.3.3-1: Cancel preconfigured regroup procedure in multiple MC
systems
1\. The authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the cancellation of

##### 10.15.3.3.4 Preconfigured group regroup rejection in multiple MC systems
Figure 10.15.3.3.4-1 illustrates the case where the procedure to initiate a
group regroup with multiple MC systems using a preconfigured MC service group
described in subclauses 10.15.3.3.1 commences, but where the request for the
regroup is rejected by the partner MC service server. The rejection can occur,
for example because one of the groups hosted by the partner MC service server
is already regrouped by other group regrouping procedures.
In this procedure, any gateway MC servers in the primary or partner MC systems
are not shown.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service client 1 is authorized to initiated a preconfigured regroup
procedure, and is receiving MC service in the primary MC system of MC service
client 1.
\- In order to be aware whether the group is regrouped, the MC service server
within the same MC system is subscribed to the group configuration in the GMS.
Figure 10.15.3.3.4-1: Regroup rejection using preconfigured group in multiple
MC systems
1\. The authorized user of MC service client 1 initiates the group regroup
procedure, specifying the list of MC service groups to be regrouped including
MC service group 1, the MC service group ID of the regroup group and the MC
service group ID of the group from which configuration information for the
regroup group is to be taken.
2\. MC service client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MC
service server.
3\. The MC service server checks that MC service client 1 is authorized to
initiate a preconfigured group regroup procedure, and resolves the group
identities of the MC service groups requested in step 1. The MC service server
also checks which group members are affiliated to the requested MC service
groups that are homed in the primary MC system. The MC service server
identifies any partner systems which are the group home systems for MC service
groups identified in the list of groups to be regrouped. The MC service server
may retrieve the configuration for the regroup group from the GMS if that
configuration information is not already known to the MC service server. The
MC service server also checks that none of the MC service groups that are
homed in the primary MC system and that are requested for regrouping are
already regrouped by any mechanism.
NOTE 1: This procedure does not require that that the authorized user of MC
service client 1 is a group member of the MC service groups listed in the
regroup request, or that the authorized user of MC service client 1 is an
affiliated group member of any of the listed MC service groups.
4\. The MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to the MC
service server in the partner MC system.
5\. The partner MC service server checks the status of any MC service groups
hosted by that partner MC service server, and determines that one or more
requested MC service groups has already been regrouped by another group
regrouping procedure.
6\. The partner MC service server sends a preconfigured regroup reject to the
primary MC service server, indicating the reason for rejection.
7\. The primary MC service server sends a preconfigured regroup reject to MC
service client 1, indicating the reason for rejection.
#### 10.15.3.4 Other preconfigured regroup procedures
##### 10.15.3.4.1 Adding newly affiliated user to preconfigured group regroup
Figure 10.15.3.4.1-1 illustrates the procedure to add a newly affiliated user
to an in-progress preconfigured MC service group regroup operation.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service client is a member of a MC service group that is part of an
in-progress preconfigured group regroup operation.
\- The MC service group identity and group configuration for the preconfigured
MC service group has been preconfigured in the MC service client, and the MC
service client has received the relevant security related information to allow
it to communicate in the MC service regroup group.
Figure 10.15.3.4.1-1: Procedure to add a newly affiliated user to a
preconfigured group regroup
1\. The MC service client affiliates to an MC service group that is currently
part of an in-progress preconfigured group regroup. The affiliation follows
the procedure in section 10.8.3.1 of this specification.
2\. The MC service server retrieves the MC service group ID of the regroup
group and the MC service group ID of the group from which configuration
information for the regroup group is to be taken.
3\. The MC service server sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MC
service client.
4\. The MC service client notifies the user of the regrouping.

regroup group.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether this procedure can be generalized to apply
to both preconfigured and GMS-based group regrouping.
Editor\'s note: Affiliations of the MC service client to the regroup group in
the MC service server and coordination to the MC System is FFS.
##### 10.15.3.4.2 Updating the MC service ID list in a preconfigured regroup
group based on user regroup
Figure 10.15.3.4.2-1 illustrates the procedure to add or remove an MC service
user based on the MC service user criteria known at the MC service server.
NOTE 1: This procedure applies to MC service users that have been added and
are to be added to the preconfigured regroup group based on MC service user
criteria known at the MC service server. If only the criteria are to be
applied, then only the criteria are included in the request and the group and
user lists are not included
Preconditions:
\- A preconfigured regroup group has been established.
\- The MC service server has selected MC service user 2 to participate in the
preconfigured regroup group based on MC service user criteria known at the MC
service server.
NOTE 2: Other participants of the preconfigured regroup group are not shown in
figure 10.15.3.4.x-1 for simplicity.
Figure 10.15.3.4.2-1: Procedure to update the MC service ID list
1\. The MC service server detects that MC service client 2, which has been
earlier included in the preconfigured regroup group, no longer meets the MC
service user criteria known at the MC service server.
2\. The MC service sends MC service client 2 a preconfigured user regroup
remove request.
3\. The MC service client 2 notifies the MC service user of the preconfigured
user regroup removal.

regroup request.
9\. The MC service client 3 may send the MC service server a preconfigured
regroup response.
10\. The MC service server updates the preconfigured regroup group (including
the MC service user ID list), and potential group communication.
## 10.16 Generic procedures for migration
### 10.16.1 General
Migration provides a means for an MC service user to obtain MC service
directly from a partner MC system. This subclause describes generic procedures
for migration which are variations of specific procedures detailed in 3GPP TS
23.379 [16], 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] and 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]. These procedures
should be read in conjunction with specific procedures in those
specifications.
### 10.16.2 Migration during an ongoing group communication
#### 10.16.2.1 General
This provides the capability for an MC service user to migrate to another MC
system during an ongoing group communication and to continue the group
communication in the other MC system.
Editor\'s note: Further study is needed for MCData services.
#### 10.16.2.2 Procedure
The procedure is based on the following existing procedures:
\- MC service group de-affiliation procedure as described in clause 10.8.4.2,
or
\- De-affiliation from MC service group(s) defined in partner MC service
system as described in clause 10.8.4.3.
\- MC service user receiving MC service from a partner MC system as described
in clause 10.1.4.3.2.
\- MC service group affiliation procedure as described in clause 10.8.3.1, or
\- Affiliation to MC service group(s) defined in partner MC system as
described in clause 10.8.3.2 or clause 10.8.3.2a.
\- Late entry MCPTT group call as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16] clause
10.6.2.3.1.1.4 (pre-arranged group call) and 3GPP TS 23.379 [16] clause
10.6.2.3.1.2.5 (chat group call).
\- Late entry MCVideo group call as described in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] clause
7.1.2.3.1.1.4 (pre-arranged) and 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] clause 7.1.2.3.1.2.6
(chat group call).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client is a receiving party in one or more ongoing group
calls in the primary MC system.
2\. The MC service UE detects the need to change the MC system.
Figure 10.16.2.2-1: Migration to partner MC system during an ongoing group
call
1\. The MC service client requests de-affiliation from MC service groups. The
MC service groups are either defined in the primary MC system (see clause
10.8.4.2) or the partner MC system (see clause 10.8.4.3).
2\. After migration to the partner MC system, the configuration management
client triggers retrieval of the MC service user profile used within the
partner MC system (see clause 10.1.4.3.2).
NOTE 1: User authentication, service authorisation and signalling plane
procedures are not shown.
3\. The MC service client requests affiliation to MC service groups. The MCPTT
groups are either defined in the primary MC system (see clause 10.8.3.1) or
the partner MC system (see clause 10.8.3.2 or clause 10.8.3.2a).
4\. If any of the received group calls are ongoing in the partner MC system,
the partner MC system shall initiate a late-entry procedure towards the MC
service client. If any of the received group calls are taken place in the
primary MC system but not yet in the partner MC system, the affiliation by the
migrated MC service UE triggers the late-entry procedure which then includes
the MC service UE and the partner MC system into the group call.
The MC service client may indicate the successful migration of group
communications to the MC service user.
#### 10.16.2.3 Void
##### 10.16.2.3.1 Void
### 10.16.3 Private call using functional alias towards a partner MC system
#### 10.16.3.1 General
This provides the possibility for an MC service user to initiate a private MC
service call using a functional alias, defined in the partner MC system, as
target address towards an MC service user in a partner MC system.
#### 10.16.3.2 Information flows
##### 10.16.3.2.1 MC service functional alias resolution request
Table 10.16.3.2.1-1 describes the information flow MC service functional alias
resolution request from the MC service server to the MC service functional
alias controlling server and from the MC service functional alias controlling
server to another MC service functional alias controlling server.
Table 10.16.3.2.1-1: MC service functional alias resolution request
information elements
Information Element Status Description
* * *
MC service ID M The MC service ID of the calling party Functional alias O The
functional alias of the calling party Functional alias M The functional alias
of the called party
##### 10.16.3.2.2 MC service functional alias resolution response
Table 10.16.3.2.2-1 describes the information flow MC service functional alias
resolution response from the MC service functional alias controlling server to
another MC service functional alias controlling server, the MC service
functional alias controlling server to the MC service server and the MC
service server to the MC service client.
Table 10.16.3.2.2-1: MC service functional alias resolution response
information elements
Information Element Status Description
* * *
MC service ID M The MC service ID of the calling party MC service ID M The
corresponding MC service ID of the called functional alias. Return \"NONE\" if
no one activates the targeted Functional Alias.
#### 10.16.3.3 Procedure
Figure 10.16.3.3-1 represents a generic MC service private call setup
procedure to allow using the functional alias as called party address, i.e.,
the MC service ID address is resolved by the partner MC system through the
primary MC service server and primary MC service functional alias controlling
server.
Additional new pre-condition:
1\. A secured connection has been established between the MC service
functional alias controlling servers in different MC systems.
Figure 10.16.3.3-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode, users
in multiple MC systems
1-2. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16] clause 10.7.2.2.3.1, 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]
clause 7.2.2.3.1 or corresponding procedures in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13], but MC
service private call request contains a functional alias of invited user.
3\. If the MC service private call request contains a functional alias instead
of an MC service ID as called party, the MC service server checks whether MC
service client 1 can use the functional alias to setup a private call. If
authorized, the MC service server 1 resolves the functional alias to the
corresponding MC service ID for which the functional alias is active by using
subsequent steps 4-7.
4\. The MC service server 1 sends an MC service functional alias resolution
request message to the MC service functional alias controlling server 1 to
resolve the functional alias of the called party.
5\. The MC service functional alias controlling server 1 determines that the
functional alias belongs to the partner MC system and forwards the MC service
functional alias resolution request message to MC service functional alias
controlling server 2.
6\. The MC service functional alias controlling server 2 resolves the
functional alias and determines the corresponding MC service ID to terminate
the call and returns it to the MC service functional alias controlling server
1 in the MC service functional alias resolution response message.
NOTE: Depending on implementation the MC service server can apply additional
call restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the
resolved MC service ID(s) (e.g., whether the MC service ID is within the
allowed area of the functional alias). If the MC service server detects that
the functional alias used as the target of the private call request is
simultaneously active for multiple MC service users, then the MC service
server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MC service ID based on some
selection criteria. The selection of an appropriate MC service ID is left to
implementation. This selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if
no suitable MC service ID is selected.
7\. The MC service functional alias controlling server 1 returns the
corresponding MC service ID to MC service server 1 in the MC service
functional alias resolution response message. The MC service server 1 checks
if MC service user at MC service client 1 is authorized to initiate the
private call to the MC service user at MC service client 2. If not authorized
stop the procedure, otherwise continue with step 8.
8\. The MC service server 1 responds with a MC service functional alias
resolution response message that contains the resolved MC service ID back to
MC service client 1.
9\. The MC service client 1 sends a new MC service private call request
towards the resolved MC service ID according 3GPP TS 23.379 [16] clause
10.7.2.2.3.1, 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] clause 7.2.2.3.1 or corresponding procedures
in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
10-14. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16] clause 10.7.2.2.3.1, 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]
clause 7.2.2.3.1 or 3GPP TS 23.282 [13] clause 7.14.2.2.
15\. The receiving MC service client 2 accepts the private call automatically,
and an acknowledgement is sent to the MC service server 2.
16\. The MC service server 2 forwards the MC service private call response
message to MC service server 1.
17-18. Same as in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16] clause 10.7.2.2.3.1, 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]
clause 7.2.2.3.1 or corresponding procedures in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
### 10.16.4 Migration during an onging private communication
#### 10.16.4.1 General
This subclause provides a generic guidance on the behaviour an MC service
client follows to perform migration during an ongoing private communication,
e.g., MCPTT private call. Once the MC service client detects the need to
migrate during an ongoing private communication, it may initiate preparations
and UE configuration which facilitate migration as mentioned in clause
10.1.1.2. The described procedure is applicable to the scenarios whether an MC
service client is migrating into its primary MC system or a partner MC system.
#### 10.16.4.2 Procedure
Figure 10.16.4.2-1 represents a generic procedure to be followed when
migration is needed to be done during an ongoing private communication, such
as MCPTT private call, or MCVideo private call.
Figure 10.16.4.2-1: Migration during ongoing private communication.
1\. A private call takes place between MC service client 1 and MC service
client 2, where the former is connected to MC system A and the latter to MC
system B.
2\. The MC service client 1 detects the need to migration into MC system C and
MC service server 1 is notified to be prepared for possible service
interruption. Furthermore, upon detection, MC service client 1 performs
initial steps to be considered prior migration, e.g., UE configuration,
authorization, and selection of user profile that permits migration, as
described in clause 10.1.1.2
3\. MC service client 1 releases the private communication towards the MC
service client 2 as described in clause 10.7.2.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]
for MCPTT private call, or in clause 7.2.2.3.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] for
MCVideo private call. A call release reason IE \"release due to migration\"
may be included so that MC service client 2 is informed.
4\. Migration takes place and MC system C retrieves MC service client 1
profile:
4a. if MC system C is the primary MC system, retrieval of MC service client 1
profile takes place according to clause 10.1.4.3.1.
4b. if MC system C is a partner MC system, retrieval of MC service client 1
profile takes place according to clause 10.1.4.3.2.
5\. Registration procedure takes place:
5a. If system C is the primary MC system, the procedure takes place according
to clause 10.6.1.
5b. If system C is a partner MC system, the procedure takes place according to
clause 10.1.6.2.
6\. MC service client 1 initiates a new private communication toward MC
service client 2 as described in clause 10.7.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [16] for
MCPTT private call, or in clause 7.2.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] for MCVideo
private call.
### 10.16.5 Generic private call procedure towards a migrated MC service user
#### 10.16.5.1 General
This subclause describes a generic private communication procedure towards a
migrated MC service user at a partner MC system. This generic private
communication can be an MCPTT private call, an MCVideo private call, or a one-
to-one MCData communication. For the generic private call, this procedure is
used in conjunction with the corresponding MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData
procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS 23.281 [12], or 3GPP TS
23.282 [13], respectively.
Once an MC service user is migrated, he or she will be assigned a new MC
service ID by the migrated MC system and this MC service ID will be used for
all his/her communications. When another MC service user communicates with the
migrated MC service user using the newly assigned MC service ID, the private
call request described in clause 10.7.2.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], in clause
7.2.2.2.1 in 3GPP TS.23.281 [12], or the corresponding procedures in 3GPP TS
23.282 [13] applies.
For callers that are not aware of the migrated MC service user`s new MC
service ID, the migrated MC service user is also reachable by his/her MC
service ID assigned by the primary MC system via redirection done by the
primary MC system`s MC service server described in this procedure.
#### 10.16.5.2 Private call redirection
Table 10.16.5.2-1 describes the information flow of a private call
redirection, which is sent from the MC service server to an MC service client
initiating a private call towards a migrated MC service user.
Table 10.16.5.2-1: Private call redirection
Information element Status Description
* * *
MC service ID M The MC service ID of the MC service user initiating a private
call, i.e., calling party. The MC service ID can either be MCPTT ID, MCVideo
ID, or MCData ID. MC service ID M The MC service ID of the target MC service
user (i.e., called party), which the MC service user has obtained from its
primary MC system before migration. The MC service ID can either be MCPTT ID,
MCVideo ID, or MCData ID. MC service ID M The MC service ID of the target MC
service user, which the MC service user has obtained from its migrated MC
system after Migration. The MC service ID can either be MCPTT ID, MCVideo ID,
or MCData ID. KMS URI (NOTE) O The KMS URI associated with the MC service ID
of the migrated MC service user. Redirection reason O The MC service server
informs the calling party that the target MC service user has migrated. NOTE:
If the KMS URI is not configured in the MC service user profile and is not
included in the private call redirection messange, then the MC service client
shall obtain KMS URI using the KMS lookup procedure defined in 3GPP TS 33.180
[19].
#### 10.16.5.3 Procedure
Figure 10.16.5.4-1 presents a generic private communication procedure from MC
service user 1 towards a migrated MC service user 2 where the MC system A is
the primary MC system of MC service user 2 before migration, and the MC system
B is the MC system that the MC service user 2 has migrated
Pre-conditions:
\- MC system A and MC system B are interconnected.
\- MC system A is the primary MC system of MC service user 2 before migration.
MC system B is the MC system that MC service user 2 has migrated.
\- The MC service server A is aware that MC service user 2 has migrated and is
informed of its MC service ID provided by MC system B, as described in clause
10.6.3.3.
Figure 10.16.5.3-1: MC private call towards a migrated MC service user.
1\. The MC service client 1 initiates a private call request towards MC
service user 2 (MC service client 2) who has migrated to MC system B. The
private call request includes among others the MC service ID of MC service
user 2, which is provided by its primary MC system, as the target, i.e.,
called party. The private call request is described in clause 10.7.2.1.1 in
3GPP TS 23.379 [16], in clause 7.2.2.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12], or the
corresponding procedures in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
If the private call request contains a functional alias instead of an MC
service ID as the target party, the MC service server A checks whether the MC
service user 1 at the MC service client 1 is allowed to use functional alias
during private call setup.
2\. MC service server A checks that MC service user 2 has migrated to MC
system B with a new MC service ID assigned by MC system B.
If the private call request contains a functional alias, and if the MC service
user 1 at the MC service client 1 is authorized, the MC service server A
resolves the functional alias to a corresponding MC service ID of the MC
service user which has activated the functional alias. If the MC service
server A determines that the corresponding MC service user of the resolved MC
service ID is migrated, i.e., MC service user 2 at MC service client 2 is
migrated, it checks whether the resolved MC service ID of the MC service user
2 is allowed to receive a private call from the MC service ID of the MC
service user 1 using functional alias based on entries in the user profile of
the MC service user 2 assigned by the primary system.
3\. The MC service server A sends a private call redirection towards the MC
service client 1, to inform MC service user 1 that the target MC service user,
i.e., MC service user 2 has migrated and its new MC service ID of MC service
user 2 assigned by the migrated MC system. The MC service client 1 releases
the private call request at step 1.
4\. The MC service client 1 initiates a private call towards MC service user
2, including the MC service ID of MC service user 2 obtained from MC system.
The initiated private call can either be an MCPTT private call, an MCVideo
private call, or a corresponding one-to-one MCData communication, and shall
perform the procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS 23.281
[12], or 3GPP TS 23.282 [13], respectively.
NOTE: If end-to-end encryption is required, the migrated MC service user 2 is
assumed to have the necessary security information needed to establish a
protected call, as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
## 10.17 Sharing administrative configuration between interconnected MC
systems
### 10.17.1 General
Cooperation between MC systems encompasses a number of cases of mutual
operation between them, e.g:
\- Migration during ongoing group or private call communication as specified
in subclause 10.16.
\- Generic procedures for interconnection as specified in clause 10.14.
\- Migration of MC service users from an MC system considered as primary or
home MC system to an partner MC system as specified in subclause 10.6.3
\- Provisioning connectivity information of partner MC system(s) for MC
service UE migration as specified in subclause 10.1.6.
\- Shared MC service groups which can be configured as described in clause
10.2.7.
The above scenarios in many cases require configurations in both the primary
MC system and the partner MC system as precondition.
Sharing administrative configuration between interconnected MC systems enables
MC administrators and authorized MC service users of the primary MC system and
the MC administrators and authorized MC service users of the partner MC system
to negotiate and and apply configuration changes between interconnected MC
systems, in order to fullfil preconditions for the cooperation between
interconnected MC systems.
# 11 MC gateway UE
## 11.1 General
An MC gateway UE enables MC service access for a MC service user residing on
non-3GPP capable devices and for devices which are unable to host MC service
clients. In order to be able to participate in a MC service, the MC gateway UE
provides the following necessary functions to enable the MC service access for
such MC clients:
\- **MC gateway client to MC gateway UE association** : Authorised binding and
use of non-3GPP based access with an MC service client. It indicate the
associated MC gateway clients when the MC gateway UE cannot serve the
connected MC service clients (any longer).
\- **3GPP transport resources** : Sharing of MC gateway UE 3GPP transport
resources among the associated MC service clients.
\- **MC client identification** : Independent MC service client
identification, MC service client authorisation and MC service profile
association.
\- **Location Management** : Providing location management support for the
associated MC clients to handle the location information and triggers related
to 3GPP access network.
\- **MC client communication integrity** : Ensure that signalling, media
content and traffic attributes, e.g. priority and QoS, of communications
between the MC system and MC service client remains unaltered.
The following functions are provided by the MC gateway client:
**\- MC gateway** **UE association** : Allowing an MC gateway client to
simultaneously bind to multiple MC gateway UEs.
NOTE 1: An MC gateway client and its associated MC clients can only have one
active binding per MC service with the associated MC gateway UE.
**\- MC service selection** : Choose between multiple MC gateway UEs for the
required MC service capability.
**\- MC service continuation** : Enables reselection of the MC gateway UE
association while MC service continues.
NOTE 2: Further information about MC gateway UE selection are summarized in
Annex D.
## 11.2 Functional Model
### 11.2.0 General
The MC gateway UE offers access to the MC server for several MC clients as
shown in Figure 11.2.0-1. The MC clients can be either located in the MC
gateway UE or in non-3GPP devices connected to the MC gateway UE via non-3GPP
access.
For non-3GPP devices which can host an MC client, the MC gateway UE enables
connectivity to the MC server. For non-3GPP devices which cannot host the MC
client, the MC gateway UE hosts the instantiation of the MC client for the
non-3GPP device.
Figure 11.2.0-1: Functional architecture
The MC gateway UE provides MC service capabilities and 3GPP access
capabilities using 3GPP network credentials for authorized access with an MC
server.
For non-3GPP devices which cannot host MC clients, the MC gateway UE shall
control the access and manage the communication between the non-3GPP devices
and the MC server. Upon reception of connection authorization request from a
non-3GPP device, the MC gateway UE instantiates an MC client, acting on behalf
of the non-3GPP device, to provide the requested services (e.g. emergency
call, group calls, short data messages services, etc.). The communication
interworking and the definition of associated procedures between the MC client
(initiated at the MC gateway UE) and the non-3GPP devices is out of scope of
this document.
NOTE 1: MC clients residing on a non-3GPP device cannot use UICC credentials
to perform authorisation with the 3GPP transport system.
For MC clients getting MC service access via the MC gateway UE, the MC gateway
UE forwards (unmodified) signalling and media from the individual MC clients
to the MC server and vice versa.
If the MC service user on the non-3GPP device utilizes multiple MC services
simultaneously, the MC service access may also be provided by one or multiple
MC gateway UEs as shown in figure 11.2.0-2 while restricting each MC service
to one MC gateway UE (e.g. MCPTT via MC gateway UE1, MCData via MC gateway
UE2).

Figure 11.2.0-2: Simultaneous multiple MC gateway UE use by a single non-3GPP
device
NOTE 2: Even not shown in the above figure, the same principle of simultaneous
use of multiple MC gateway UEs is applied for non-3GPP devices which cannot
host an MC client.
### 11.2.1 Functional model
For the application-level signalling necessary for the association between the
MC client on the non-3GPP device and the MC gateway UE reference point
Gateway-local (GW-local) is used. The MC gateway UE uses the Gateway-Core (GW-
Core) reference point towards the MC service server to announce the
association between MC gateway client and MC gateway UE server. Once the use
of the MC gateway UE has been authenticated and authorized by the
corresponding MC service server, the MC service user is authorized MC gateway
user.
The MC gateway UE sever enables the following functions:
\- Authentication of the MC gateway clients including the MC gateway UE
function of the corresponding MC service server
\- The following functions are available when the connection authorization of
the MC gateway client is successful:
\- Relay of signalling between MC client and MC service server/CSC server
\- Relay of signaling between the signaling user agent residing on the
non-3GPP device and the SIP core
\- Relay of signaling between the HTTP client residing on the non-3GPP device
and the HTTP proxy
\- Media plane forwarding between the MC service server and the MC clients
The MC gateway UE function as part of the corresponding MC service server
enables the use of an MC gateway UE with a corresponding MC gateway UE
function that authorizes the association between the MC gateway client/MC
client and the corresponding MC gateway UE to enable forwarding of the media
plane to MC clients via the MC gateway UE.
Figure 11.2.1-1: Functional model of MC gateway UE signalling plane
11.2.2 Reference points
#### 11.2.2.1 General
The reference points for the use of the MC gateway UE are described in the
following subclauses.
#### 11.2.2.2 Reference point GW-local (between the MC gateway client and the
MC gateway UE server)
The GW-local reference point between the MC gateway client and the MC gateway
UE server in the MC gateway UE is used:
\- To authorize the use of the MC gateway UE,
\- To manage (request/release) forwarding of the signalling, media from the MC
gateway UE to the MC gateway client and its associated MC clients for unicast,
multicast/broadcast communication using corresponding identifiers, e.g., TMGI,
\- To disconnect from the use of the MC gateway UE.
\- To notify about the connection status.
The GW-local reference point is based on HTTP-1 reference point.
#### 11.2.2.3 Reference point GW-Core (between the MC gateway UE server and
the MC service server)
The GW-Core reference point between the MC gateway UE server in the MC gateway
UE and the MC service server shall be used:
\- To authorise the use of the MC gateway UE by the corresponding MC service
server.
\- To manage (request/release) transport resources between the MC gateway UE
and the MC service server signalling purposes are associated with the MC
clients residing on a non-3GPP device,
\- To disconnect from the use of the MC gateway UE.
NOTE 1: Signalling of the MC clients utilizes the allocated resources (default
bearer for EPS or corresponding QoS flow in 5GS) and if necessary, MC gateway
UE may request additional resources.
NOTE 2: The authorized use of necessary connectivity between the non-3GPP
device and the MC gateway UE is outside 3GPP specification.
The GW-Core reference point is based on HTTP-1 reference point as shown in
figure 7.3.1-2.
#### 11.2.2.4 Reference points CSC-n, SIP-1 and HTTP-1
The reference points CSC-n belonging to the application plane and the
reference points SIP-1 and HTTP-1 belonging to the signaling control plane are
relayed by the MC gateway UE between MC client on the non-3GPP device towards
the MC gateway UE and the corresponding MC service server.
CSC-n, SIP-1 and HTTP-1 reference points are specified in the present
specification. The MCX-n reference points are specified in 3GPP TS 23.379
[16], 3GPP TS 23.281 [12] and 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
11.2.3 Media plane aspects
The MC gateway UE forms the relay unit for the media plane between MC server
and MC client using 3GPP transport resources on one hand and non-3GPP
transport resources on the other hand. The media forwarding function relays
the media traffic for unicast and multicast/broadcast between the 3GPP
connectivity and non-3GPP connectivity following the media forwarding request
controlled by the MC gateway UE server. For the use of unicast media and
multicast/broadcast media the corresponding reference points of the respective
MC service applies. The corresponding media parameter applies between the
respective service dependent media function and service dependent media
distribution function.
Figure 11.2.3-1: Function Model of MC gateway UE media plane
## 11.3 Using identities behind the MC gateway UE
### 11.3.1 General
The MC gateway UE enables access to the MC system for MC service clients
either hosted on the MC gateway UE or hosted on non-3GPP devices using
non-3GPP connectivity with the MC gateway UE. Simultaneous sharing of an MC
gateway UE by multiple MC service clients requires a unique relationship
between the MC service identities used by the MC service clients with
corresponding media streams passing the MC gateway UE towards the MC system
sharing 3GPP connectivity of the MC gateway UE.
An MC service user behind the MC gateway UE has no 3GPP transport access
credentials (i.e., no UICC), whereas the MC system relies on private user
identity associated with public user identities (i.e., IMPU/IMPI) needed for
authentication purposes. Moreover, the one-to-one correspondence between MC
service ID and IMPUs enables routing of signalling traffic between the MC
service server and the MC service client.
The use of the various mission critical user identities is determined by
clause 8 of the present document.
### 11.3.2 When using separate IMS subscriptions
If the MC service clients are hosted by non-3GPP devices or the MC service
clients are hosted by the MC gateway UE, an MC service user corresponding to
an MC client uses a dedicated IMS/SIP subscription without any relation to the
MC gateway UE subscription.
Figure 11.3.2-1 depicts the use of the IMS Credential (IMC) application in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
Figure 11.3.2-1: IMC per MC service client
The MC service user profiles are independent of the MC gateway MC service user
profile.
### 11.3.3 When sharing MC gateway UE\'s IMS subscription
For the case of non-3GPP devices which are unable to host an MC service
client, the MC gateway UE forwards the media from/ to the non-3GPP devices
behind the MC gateway UE. As there are no MC service clients hosted by the
non-3GPP devices, they rely on credentials at the MC gateway UE to access MC
services.
The MC service clients, instantiated at the MC gateway UE on behalf of the
non-3GPP devices which cannot host an MC service client, rely on MC service
IDs provided by the MC gateway UE. In this case, the MC service clients
instantiated at the MC gateway UE share the credentials from the IMS
subscription of the MC gateway UE, as shown in Figure 11.3.3-1. The number of
MC service clients at the MC gateway UE, which are instantiated on behalf on
the non-3GPP devices which cannot host an MC service client, is determined by
the number of subscribed MC service IDs that are associated with the IMS
subscription of the MC gateway UE.
Figure 11.3.3-1: Sharing MC gateway UE\'s IMC for non-3GPP devices which
cannot host a client
## 11.4 MC gateway UE routing capabilities
### 11.4.1 General
The use of the MC gateway UE requires the support of an IP network behind the
MC gateway UE, that a range of IP addresses are reachable over a single MC
gateway UE. That enables the forwarding of signalling information and media
plane between non-3GPP devices and MC server by the MC gateway UE.
### 11.4.2 MC client IP address association
The use of a unique IP address by the MC clients shall be ensured for the
period of association of the MC clients via the MC gateway UE with the IMS/SIP
core and the MC server. Each MC gateway UE requires a unique IP address range
for their MC client association which is known by the MC service environment
and a correlation between the MC client\'s IP address and the MC gateway UE\'s
IP address exists.
Figure 11.4.2-1: MC client IP address relationship
Framed routing in accordance with IETF RFC 2865 [32], IETF RFC 3162 [33], 3GPP
TS 23.501 [34] shall be used to enable the support of an IP network behind the
MC gateway UE, such that a range of IP addresses is reachable over a single
3GPP transport session. It allows the routing of packets to IP addresses that
do not belong to the PDN/PDU session of the MC gateway UE.
NOTE: The MC gateway UE can provide necessary IP address allocation to MC
clients, e.g., as a DHCP relay agent in accordance with IETF RFC 1541 [35] and
IETF RFC 8415 [36], or as a requesting router in accordance with IETF RFC 8415
[36] and 3GPP TS 23.401 [17] when using IPv6 prefix delegation.
11.4.3 IP address association using the MC gateway UE
If the MC client relies on IP address provided by the MC gateway UE, the MC
gateway UE shall store the correlation between the GW MC service ID and the IP
address (MC gateway UE IP and the local IP) used by the MC client once it
performs the connection authorisation to the MC service server (see clause
11.5.1 and clause 11.5.2). Subsequent procedures initiated by the MC client,
i.e. SIP registration, user authentication and service authorisation uses the
MC gateway UE\'s IP address.
The MC gateway UE assigns the local IPs from address pool which it maintains
to the individual MC clients. Managing the local IP addresses, re-using the
local IP address, and how the traffic is routed between the MC clients and the
network is left for implementation.
Figure 11.4.3-1: non-3GPP device uses MC gateway UE\'s IP address
## 11.5 Procedures and information flows
### 11.5.1 Connection authorisation mechanisms
#### 11.5.1.1 General
The connection of non-3GPP devices via an MC gateway UE require authorisation
verification by the MC system. Two different types of non-3GPP devices are
supported, those which can host MC service client and those which cannot host
MC service clients.
#### 11.5.1.2 Connection authorisation for non-3GPP devices that host an MC
client
##### 11.5.1.2.1 General
The solution is applied to non-3GPP devices which can host an MC client. The
MC server performs authorization for the use of the MC gateway UE by the MC
gateway client, i.e. the binding between the MC gateway UE and the MC gateway
client is authorized and controlled by the MC server. The MC gateway client
informs MC clients about the connection status.
For the period of association between MC server, MC gateway client and MC
gateway UE, the MC server maintains the assignment between MC clients to the
MC gateway UE used. This assignment is cancelled again with the disconnection.
##### 11.5.1.2.2 Information flows
###### 11.5.1.2.2.1 Connection authorization request
Table 11.5.1.2.2.1-1 describes the information flow connection authorization
request sent from the MC gateway client, which resides on a non-3GPP device,
to the MC gateway UE, and from the MC gateway UE to the MC server.

##### 11.5.1.2.3 Connection authorisation procedure
The procedure for connection authorisation via an MC gateway UE towards an MC
server is shown in figure 11.5.1.2.3-1.
Pre-conditions
\- The MC service user wishes to have access to MC services using a non-3GPP
device.
\- The MC gateway client has been configured with the necessary parameters
needed for connectivity with the MC gateway UE.
\- The MC gateway client hosted at the non-3GPP device has been provided with
an appropriate GW MC service ID.
\- The MC gateway UE has performed service authorization for one or more MC
services with the MC system as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS
23.281 [12], and 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
\- The MC gateway client has selected an MC gateway UE or alternatively, the
MC gateway client has performed a selection by internal criteria.
NOTE: The internal criteria are outside the scope of the present document.
Figure 11.5.1.2.3-1: Connection authorisation with an MC server via an MC
gateway UE
1\. The MC gateway client requests connection authorization via the MC gateway
UE with an MC server. The MC gateway client provides the GW MC service ID.
2\. The MC gateway UE checks whether the requested MC service, as indicated by
the GW MC service ID, is supported. The MC gateway UE may also check whether
sufficient resources are available or if any other local criteria are met. If
the MC service is supported, the procedure continues with step 3, otherwise
the procedure proceeds with step 7.
NOTE: Further information to the MC gateway UE selection is in Annex D.
3\. The MC gateway UE sends the connection authorization request to the MC
server.
4\. The MC server performs an authorization check, to verify that access via
the MC gateway UE is permitted. An MC server shall reject the connection
authorization when the MC server receives connection authorization from a MC
gateway client for a particular MC service for which the connection already
exists with the same or different MC gateway UE.
5\. The MC server sends the connection authorization response to the MC
gateway UE.
6\. The MC gateway UE marks the MC gateway client as authorized to have MC
service access via the MC gateway UE.
7\. The MC gateway UE sends the connection authorization response to the MC
gateway client.
After successful connection with the MC gateway UE, the MC clients have access
to the MC server and may continue with user authentication and service
authorization.
If the MC service user wishes to have access to another MC service, the above
procedure is repeated. The MC service user may select a different MC gateway
UE for the new MC service, if multiple MC gateway UEs are available.
#### 11.5.1.3 Connection authorisation for non-3GPP devices that do not host
an MC client
##### 11.5.1.3.1 General
The clause is applied to non-3GPP devices which cannot host an MC client. The
MC server performs authorization for the use of the MC gateway UE by the MC
gateway client, i.e. the binding between the MC gateway UE and the MC client
is authorized and controlled by the MC server.
> NOTE: The interworking between the MC gateway client hosted at the MC
> gateway UE and an MC service user is out of scope of the present document,

##### 11.5.1.3.3 Connection authorisation procedure
The procedure for connection authorisation of an MC gateway client hosted by
the MC gateway UE towards an MC server is shown in figure 11.5.1.3.3-1.
Pre-conditions
\- The MC service user wishes to have access to MC services using a non-3GPP
device, where the MC gateway client and MC clients are hosted by the MC
gateway UE.
\- The MC gateway client has selected an MC gateway UE or alternatively, the
non-3GPP has performed a selection by internal criteria.
NOTE: The internal criteria are outside the scope of the present document.
\- The MC gateway client, which is hosted by the MC gateway UE, has been
configured with the necessary parameters needed for connectivity with the MC
gateway UE.
\- The MC gateway UE has performed service authorization for one or more MC
services with the MC system as described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], 3GPP TS
23.281 [12], and 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]].
Figure 11.5.1.3.3-1: Connection authorisation of an MC gateway client hosted
by an MC gateway UE
1\. The MC gateway client, hosted by the MC gateway UE, requests connection
authorization with an MC server by providing the GW MC service ID. The MC
gateway UE sends the connection authorization request to the MC server.
2\. The MC server performs an authorization check, to verify that access using
the MC gateway UE is permitted. An MC server shall reject the connection
authorization when the MC server receives connection authorization from a MC
gateway client for a particular MC service for which the connection already
exists with the same or different MC gateway UE.
3\. The MC server sends the connection authorization response to the MC
gateway client residing on the MC gateway UE.
The MC gateway client has now access to the MC server and may continue with
user authentication and service authorization.
If the MC service user wishes to have access to another MC service, the above
procedure is repeated. The MC service user may select a different MC gateway
UE for the new MC service, if multiple MC gateway UEs are available.
### 11.5.2 3GPP access network related location information management
#### 11.5.2.1 General
The MC clients residing on the non-3GPP devices may receive the location
reporting configuration from the location management server containing the
trigger criteria related to 3GPP access network related location parameters
and the requested location information may contain the 3GPP access network
related location information. The procedures defined in this subclause enables
the MC clients residing on the non-3GPP devices to request the MC gateway UE
to handle these triggers on its behalf and to request the required location
information (3GPP access network related) from MC gateway UE.
#### 11.5.2.2 Information flows
##### 11.5.2.2.1 MC GW location reporting configuration
Table 11.5.2.2.1-1 describes the information flow from the MC client, which
resides on a non-3GPP device, to the MC gateway UE for the location reporting
configuration.

#### 11.5.2.3 Procedures
##### 11.5.2.3.1 Event triggered location reporting procedure
The procedure for how the MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices handling the
location reporting configuration containing the trigger criteria related to
the 3GPP access network related location information is shown in the figure
11.5.2.3.1-1.
Pre-conditions
\- The MC service user wishes to have access to MC services by using a
non-3GPP device.
\- The MC client successfully completed service authorization via MC gateway
UE.
Figure 11.5.2.3.1-1: Event-triggered location reporting procedure
1\. MC client receives the location reporting configuration request from LMS
which contains the triggering criteria of 3GPP access network related location
information changes.
2\. MC client sends the MC GW location reporting configuration to the MC
gateway UE containing the 3GPP access network related location information
triggers and the requested location information. MC Gateway UE stores the
location reporting configuration and starts monitoring for the triggers as
received in the MC GW location reporting configuration.
3\. A location reporting event occurs, triggering step 4.
4\. MC gateway UE sends the MC GW Location information report containing the
location information requested by the MC client.
5\. MC client updates the locally available location information with the
location information received from the MC gateway UE.
6\. The MC client sends a location information report to the location
management server, containing location information identified by the location
management server and available to the MC client.
##### 11.5.2.3.2 On-demand location reporting procedure
The MC client may need to immediately send the location report to the location
management sometimes and the requested location information may be related to

### 11.5.3 MBMS support for MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices
#### 11.5.3.1 General
This subclause addresses the MBMS support for the MC clients residing on the
non-3GPP devices associated with an MC gateway UE. The MC clients instruct the
MC gateway UE about the corresponding MBMS bearer details to enable MC gateway
listening on them. On demand, MC gateway UE forwards the traffic received over
MBMS bearer to the MC clients residing on non‑3GPP devices. With the procedure
defined in this subclause MBMS bearer can be supported for the MC clients
residing on non-3GPP devices. Changes required are confined to the reference
point between MC gateway UE and the MC clients residing on non‑3GPP devices.
MC service server may consider the location of the corresponding MC clients as
defined in subclause 11.5.2 while deciding to establish MBMS bearer.

#### 11.5.3.3 Procedures
##### 11.5.3.3.1 Procedure for handling MBMS bearer announcement
MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices receive MBMS bearer announcements from
the MC system, MC clients share the details of the MBMS bearer received in
MBMS bearer announcement to the MC gateway UE. This enables the MC gateway UE
to start monitoring the corresponding MBMS bearer.
Figure 11.5.3.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure for handling the MBMS bearer
announcement by the MC client and the MC gateway UE.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC client has been configured with the necessary parameters to enable
the use of the MC gateway UE.
2\. The MC client successfully completed service authorization via MC gateway
UE.
Figure 11.5.3.3.1-1: Handling of MBMS bearer announcement
1\. The MC service server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) according to the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18]. Service description associated with
the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from the BM-SC.
2\. The MC service server provides service description information associated
with the MBMS bearer to the MC client residing on non‑3GPP devices via MC
gateway UE.
3\. The MC client sends the MC GW MBMS bearer announcement to the MC Gateway
UE containing the MBMS bearer related information received from the MC service
server.
4\. The MC gateway UE stores the information associated with the TMGI(s). The
MC gateway UE uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to
activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer.
5\. The MC gateway UE that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI notifies to the MC client that it can receive data over MBMS by
sending the MC GW MBMS listening status report. The MC GW MBMS listening
status report also contains the details of the non‑3GPP transport resources
related parameters. The MC gateway UE may choose to send the details of
existing transport resources information as part of non-3GPP transport
resources establishment parameters IE if existing communication channel can be
reused.
6\. The MC client establishes the transport resources with the MC gateway UE
based on the parameters received in step 5 to receive the MC service data from
the MC gateway UE, if these parameters are not referring to any of the already
established transport resources. The MC Gateway UE forwards the MC service
data it received over the MBMS bearer from the MC service server to the MC
client over this transport resources.
7\. The MC client sends the MBMS Listening Status Report to the MC service
server indicating that it is able to receive the media over MBMS.
##### 11.5.3.3.2 Procedure for handling MapGroupToBearer message
Whenever the MC client detects that traffic received from MC service server is
MapGroupToBearer message and if the MC client participates in the group
session or communication identified by the MapGroupToBearer message then it
should inform the details contained in the MapGroupToBearer message to MC
gateway UE. When the association of group call, MBMS bearer and the MC GW
service ID of the MC client is known to the MC gateway UE, it can forward the
traffic received over MBMS bearer accordingly.
Figure 11.5.3.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for handling the
MapGroupToBearer message by the MC client and the MC gateway UE.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC client has been configured with the necessary parameters needed for
connectivity with the MC gateway UE.
2\. The MC client successfully completed service authorization via MC gateway
UE.
Figure 11.5.3.3.2-1: Handling of MapGroupToBearer message
1\. The MC service server sends a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS
bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between
the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MC
service group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the
activated MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the
MBMS bearer broadcasting the call.
2\. If the MC client is participating in the MC group communication identified
by the MapGroupToBearer message, it sends the details contained in the
MapGroupToBearer message to the MC gateway UE through MC GW MapGroupToBearer
request message.
3\. The MC gateway UE on receiving the MC GW MapGroupToBearer Request message
from the MC client it maintains the association between the GW MC Service ID
and the corresponding MBMS sub channel.
4\. The MC gateway UE sends the MC GW MapGroupToBearer response message to the
MC client which contains the details of the non‑3GPP transport resources
related parameters. The MC gateway UE may choose to send the details of
existing communication channel information as part of non-3GPP transport
resources establishment parameters IE if existing transport resources can be
reused.
5\. The MC client establishes the communication channel with the MC gateway UE
based on the parameters received in step 4 to receive the MC service group
communication data from the MC gateway UE, if these parameters are not
referring to any of the already established transport resources. The MC
Gateway UE forwards the MC service group communication data it received over
the MBMS bearer from the MC service server to the MC client over this
transport resources.
6\. The MC service server sends the downlink media for the group communication
session over the MBMS bearer.
7\. The MC gateway UE checks which MC clients should receive the media of the
MC group communication based on Step 3.
8\. The MC gateway UE forwards the downlink media to the intended MC clients
over the transport resources established as in step 5.
##### 11.5.3.3.2A Procedure for handling UnmapGroupFromBearer message
Whenever the MC client receives UnmapGroupFromBearer message and if the MC
client participates in the group session or communication identified by the
UnmapGroupFromBearer message then it should inform the details contained in
the UnmapGroupFromBearer message to MC gateway UE. When the association of
group call, MBMS bearer and the MC GW service ID of the MC client is known to
the MC gateway UE, it can remove the association and stop forwarding of the
traffic received over MBMS bearer accordingly.
Figure 11.5.3.3.2A-1 illustrates the procedure for handling the
UnmapGroupFromBearer message by the MC client and the MC gateway UE.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC client has been configured with the necessary parameters needed for
connectivity with the MC gateway UE.
2\. The MC client successfully completed service authorization via MC gateway
UE.
Figure 11.5.3.3.2A-1: Handling of UnmapGroupFromBearer message
1\. An MCPTT group call is ongoing; the MC gateway UE forwards the downlink
media to the intended MC client over the transport resources established.
2\. MCPTT server has determined to disconnect the call over the MBMS bearer
for the MC client.
3\. An UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCPTT server to MC client
(if in MBMS coverage area) on MBMS bearer(s).
4\. If the MC client is participating in the MC group communication identified
by the UnmapGroupFromBearer message, it sends the details contained in the
UnmapGroupFromBearer message to the MC gateway UE through MC GW
UnMapGroupToBearer request message.
5\. The MC gateway UE on receiving the MC GW UnMapGroupToBearer Request
message from the MC client it removes the association maintained between the
GW MC Service ID and the corresponding MBMS sub channel.
6\. The MC gateway UE sends the MC GW MapGroupToBearer response message to the
MC client.
##### 11.5.3.3.3 Procedure for MBMS bearer suspension notification
The MC service server can choose to instruct some MC clients to send the MBMS
bearer suspension report when notified by RAN. When the MC clients are
residing on non 3GPP devices, MC gateway UE would be the one listening on the
MBMS bearers. When RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer it indicates the MC
gateway UE. MC gateway UE to notify the MC clients it is serving so that MC
clients can report the same to the MC service server. This procedure is
applicable only if the MC client is instructed to report the MBMS bearer
suspension. Irrespective of whether the MC clients need to send the MBMS
bearer suspension report to the MC service server, MC gateway can choose to
notify the MC clients it is serving whenever RAN suspends the MBMS bearer. MC
clients can then decide to send the MBMS bearer suspension report to the MC
service server only if they are instructed by the MC service server.
Figure 11.5.3.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure for MC clients residing on
non-3GPP devices reporting the MC service server about the MBMS bearer
suspension.
Figure 11.5.3.3.3-1: MBMS bearer suspension notification
1\. The MC service server sends an MBMS suspension reporting instruction to
the MC client residing on non-3GPP device.
NOTE: This message may be included in the MBMS bearer announcement message and
may be sent both on a unicast bearer and a multicast bearer.
2\. RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures
in 3GPP TS 36.300 [21].
3\. An MBMS suspension indication is sent to the MC gateway UE in the MSI (MCH
Scheduling Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300
[21].
4\. The MC gateway UE detect the MBMS suspension and sends an MC GW MBMS
suspension indication to the MC Client residing on non-3GPP device.
5\. The MC client MBMS suspension report to the MC Service server via MC
gateway UE.
##### 11.5.3.3.4 Procedure for reporting MBMS bearer quality
The MC gateway UE listening on the MBMS bearer has to report the MBMS bearer
quality to the MC clients so that MC clients can report the same to the MC
service server. MC Gateway UE monitors an MBMS bearer to receive MC service
media. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality) the MC gateway
UE needs to inform the MC Clients which requested the MC gateway UE to listen
on MBMS bearer, whether it is able to receive the MC service media on the MBMS
bearer with sufficient quality or not the MC Clients can inform the MC service
server accordingly.
Figure 11.5.3.3.4-1 illustrates the procedure for MC clients residing on
non‑3GPP devices reporting the MC service server about the MBMS bearer
quality.
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is
announced to the MC gateway UE.
2\. The MC gateway UE is located in the MBMS broadcasting area
3\. The MC gateway UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the
modulation and coding scheme.
4\. The MC gateway UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when
MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals.
Figure 11.5.3.3.4-1: Reporting MBMS bearer quality
1\. The MC gateway UE follows the Step 1 of the procedure as described in
clause 10.7.3.6.2 for the MC service UE. The corresponding MBMS bearer quality
information is forwarded to all the MC clients which have asked the MC gateway
UE to listen on the particular MBMS bearer.
2\. If the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the MC gateway UE
sends an MC GW MBMS bearer quality report to the MC client. The threshold is
used to define the MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer
quality has been acceptable or not to receive a specific MC service media. If
the MBMS bearer quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level,
the MC gateway UE may send an MBMS Bearer Quality report including the MBMS
reception quality level to the MC Client.
NOTE: The threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on service
type (i.e. MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The metrics used
and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this specification.
3\. The MC Client sends the MBMS listening status report to the MC Service
server via MC gateway UE containing the information received in the MC GW MBMS
bearer quality report.
4\. The MC service server may send an additional proposal for measurements
e.g. information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS
bearer announcement message.
### 11.5.4 Disconnection mechanism
#### 11.5.4.1 General
A connection using an MC gateway UE by the corresponding MC gateway client can
be cancelled over time or re-established using same or another MC gateway UE.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Configuration data for MC services
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
for MC services, which belong to one of the following categories:
\- MC service UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MC service user profile data (see subclause A.3);
\- MC service group configuration data (see subclause A.4);
\- MC service configuration data (see subclause A.5); and
\- Initial MC service UE configuration data (see subclause A.6).
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both on‑network and off‑network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MC service UE,
MC service group, MC service user and MC service configuration data refers to
the information that will be stored against each MC service UE, MC service
group, MC service user and MC service. This means that the three separate
tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for
each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each
configuration data category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.280
[3] or 3GPP TS 22.281 [4] or 3GPP TS 22.282 [5] or 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] or the
corresponding subclause from the present document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the
configuration data is common across all the three tables of on-network and
off‑network, on‑network only and off‑network only. The level of a parameter
within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the
character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per
level. Parameters that are at the top‑most level within the hierarchy have no
\">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MC service UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MC service UE configuration data
MC service UE configuration data has to be known by an MC service UE after MC
service authorization. The CSC-4 reference point is used for configuration
between the configuration management server and the configuration management
client on the MC service UE when the MC service UE is on-network.
MC service UE configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-11
reference point.
MC service UE configuration data is specific to each MC service and is
specified as follows:
\- MCPTT UE configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];
\- MCVideo UE configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]; and
\- MCData UE configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
Within each MC service, the MC service UE configuration data can be the same
or different across MC service UEs.
# A.3 MC service user profile configuration data
The MC service user profile configuration data is stored in the MC service
user database. The configuration management server is used to configure the MC
service user profile configuration data to the MC service user database
(CSC-13) and MC service UE (CSC-4).
MC service user profile configuration data can be configured offline using the
CSC-11 reference point.
MC service user profile configuration data is specific to each MC service and
is specified as follows:
\- MCPTT user profile configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];
\- MCVideo user profile configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281
[12];
\- MCData user profile configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13];
and
\- Location user profile configuration data is specified in clause A.8.
# A.4 Group configuration data
The group configuration data is stored in the group management server. The
group management server is used to configure the group configuration data to
the MC service UE (CSC-2) and the MC service server (CSC-3).
A single group can support one or multiple MC service configurations. Hence,
the MC service group configuration data is divided into common group
configuration data and MC service specific group configuration data.
The group configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-12
reference point.
The common group configuration data are specified in table A.4-1. Tables A.4-1
and A.4-2 contain the group configuration required to support the use of on-
network MC service. Tables A.4-1 and A.4-3 contain the group configuration
required to support the use of off-network MC service.
The MC service related group configuration data specific to each MC service is
specified as follows:
\- MCPTT related group configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];
\- MCVideo related group configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281
[12]; and
\- MCData related group configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282
[13];

# A.5 MC service configuration data
The MC service configuration data is stored in the MC service server. The
configuration management server is used to configure the MC service
configuration data to the MC service server (CSC-5) and the MC service UE
(CSC-4).
The MC service configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-11
reference point.
The MC service configuration data is specific to each MC service and hence the
detailed list of MC service configuration data is listed as follows:
\- MCPTT service configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];
\- MCVideo service configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]; and
\- MCData service configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13];
# A.6 Initial MC service UE configuration data
The initial MC service UE configuration data is essential to the MC service UE
to successfully connect to the MC system. The initial MC service UE
configuration data can be the same or different across MC service UEs.
Data in table A.6-1 is provided to the MC service UE's clients (e.g. MC
service client, group management client, configuration management client,
identity management client, key management client) during the bootstrap
process (see subclause 10.1.1), and can be configured on the MC service UE
offline using the CSC-11 reference point or via other means e.g. as part of
the MCPTT client's provisioning on the UE, using a device management
procedure.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Service continuity for MC service
# B.1 Service continuity between on-network MC service and UE-to-network relay
MC service
This annex describes how 3GPP TS 23.237 [10] mechanisms for IMS service
continuity can be used to provide service continuity between on-network MC
service and UE-to-network relay MC service. For illustration, MCPTT AS is
considered as the MC service.
Only the procedure for service continuity from on-network MCPTT service to UE-
to-network relay MCPTT service is described in figure B.1-1. The procedure for
service continuity in the opposite direction is identical.
Figure B.1-1: Service continuity from on-network to UE-to-network relay
As illustrated in figure B.1-1:
\- Initially UE-1 has a direct connection to the network (on-network MCPTT
service). It is registered with the SIP core and is engaged in a SIP session
with the MCPTT Application Server (solid lines SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure
B.1-1).
\- When UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network, or after
the connection to the network has been lost, UE-1 discovers a UE-to-network
relay (UE-R) and establishes a PC5 connection with UE-R. UE-1 registers with
the SIP core over the target access leg and enters UE-to-network relay MCPTT
service by transferring the media streams over the target leg (dashed lines
SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure B.1-1).
\- The SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity
Application Server (SCC AS) before and after the handover, as described in
3GPP TS 23.237 [10].
Depicted in figure B.1-2 is the call flow for service continuity when the UE
switches from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network MCPTT relay service.
Figure B.1-2 Service continuity when UE switches from on-network MCPTT service
to UE-to-network relay MCPTT service
0\. UE-1 has a direct connection to the network and is engaged in a SIP
session with the MCPTT AS (on-network MCPTT service). The SIP session is
anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity Application Server (SCC
AS) and a Session transfer Identifier (STI) is assigned for the anchored SIP
session, as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [10].
1\. UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network or has
completely lost it.
2\. UE-1 (in the role of remote UE) performs ProSe UE-to-network relay
discovery over PC5 and establishes a secure point-to-point link with the relay
(UE-R) over PC5. As part of this process the remote UE is mutually
authenticated at PC5 layer with either the relay or with the network as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]. In the process UE-1 is also assigned an IP
address/prefix by the relay.
NOTE 1: If step 2 is started after losing connection, the service interruption
can be noticeable to the user.
NOTE 2: Step 2 will be entirely described under in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].
3: UE-1 registers with the SIP core over the UE-to-network relay leg.
4\. In order to transfer the media streams of the SIP session UE-1 sends an
INVITE message on the new access leg towards the SCC AS. The INVITE message
includes the STI identifying the session to be transferred. The SCC AS
identifies the session based on STI and updates the session over the remote
access leg i.e. towards the MCPTT AS.
5\. The procedure is completed when all media streams have been transferred on
the access leg relayed via UE-R. At this point UE-1 may deregister the on-
network leg if it still has direct network connection (not shown in the
figure).
NOTE 3: The procedure for service continuity is always completed with unicast
delivery on the target side. If MCPTT content is being distributed on the
target side in multicast mode, then switching from unicast to multicast
delivery is performed after completion of the service continuity procedure.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Application Priority
# C.1 Use of application priorities
Different communications between two or more MC service users need to be
distinguished in their urgency in order to appropriately or less preferably
allocate 3GPP system transport resources. Also simultaneous incoming
communications to a MC service user requires an indication of the urgency in
order to preferentially join the communication in accordance with the urgency.
To make this distinction of urgencies, the MC system necessarily supports
different types of priorities and corresponding levels within each priority
category representing the relative importance of a request at the application
level. The use of application priority allows the MC system to decide whether
a communication establishment or modification request can be accepted or needs
to be rejected (e.g. in case of transport resource limitations), or it allows
the MC service client to rank simultaneous incoming communication for
presentation to an MC service user. Hence the application priority can also be
used to decide which existing transport resources (e.g. bearers) to pre-empt
during resource limitations. Such pre-emption capability information defines
whether a communication can obtain transport resources that were already
assigned to another communication with a lower priority level. The pre-emption
vulnerability information defines whether a communication can lose the
resources assigned to it in order to admit a communication with higher
priority level.
The following types of application priorities are provided by the MC system:
Figure C.1.-1: Types of application priorities in the MC system
Communication priority involves a combination of the type of
call/communication, the role of the requesting MC service user, and the
predefined/requested priority of the initiating MC service user and/or group.
Presentation priority involves the determination of which communications, from
within multiple simultaneous possible, are the highest priority to present to
the MC service user either audibly or visibly. An example would be a private
call received at the same time as an emergency call on a monitored group. This
category can be configured uniquely for each MC service user.
Floor priority involves the determination of who can transmit within a
communication at a particular time. This is essentially the priority of the MC
service user according to its profile, and possibly modified by its role
and/or mode of service (e.g. using emergency or imminent peril call). This
category is used, for example, to determine the ordering of the floor control
queue within an established communication.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Consideration MC gateway UE selection
# D.1 General
Operating conditions can influence the selection and the use of the MC gateway
UE and its response/decision on providing an MC client connection to the MC
server. Potential conditions should be verified by the MC gateway UE when
sending connection notification, and upon reception of the connection
authorization response.
Such status information can be considered by the MC client either to associate
with another MC gateway UE (e.g. with better operating conditions for the
requested service), or to re-associate to the same MC gateway UE (e.g.
reattempt association after a certain time).
# D.2 Potential Conditions
Possible operating conditions information could belong to one of the following
categories:
**MC gateway UE capacity limits**
The MC gateway UE might not be able to allow MC clients to associate when the
limit of connected MC clients has been reached.
**3GPP access congestion**
The MC gateway UE can make use of to the special Categories/Access Identity,
the preferential access applies based on its assigned Access Control
Class/Access Identity during periods of congestion. The MC gateway UE
subscription allows to obtain priority treatment for the required
communication.
Nevertheless, the serving access network can indicate to the UEs (including MC
gateway UE) that Access Class Barring applies and this can passed by the MC
gateway UE to the associated MC client.
**PLMN reselection and migration**
Depending on operator policy, roaming agreements, and on national/regional
regulatory requirements MC gateway UE disassociation and re-association with
the corresponding MC server are necessary (e.g. to handle the IP connectivity,
QoS, etc.).
**Network status information**
If the network status information of an EPS/5GS capability available at MC
gateway UE, it can be further propagated to the corresponding associated MC
clients for further processing (e.g. if the requested QoS for service can be
provided for MC client or not).
