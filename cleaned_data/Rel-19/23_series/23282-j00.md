# 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support the Mission Critical Data (MCData)
services. MCData is a suite of services which utilizes the common functional
architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] to support MC services over LTE
including the common services core.
MCData services suite consists of the following sub-services:
\- short data service (SDS);
\- file distribution (FD);
\- data streaming (DS); and
NOTE: Procedures for DS are not covered in the current specification.
\- IP connectivity.
MCData features include:
\- conversation management;
\- transmission and reception control;
\- communication release; and
\- enhanced status.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.282 [3] and
3GPP TS 22.280 [2].
The present document is applicable primarily to MCData service using E-UTRAN
access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4]. Certain
application functions of the MCData service could also be supported via
non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality is specified to
support non-3GPP access.
The MCData service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.

# 4 Introduction
The MCData service suite provides a set of generic capabilities and specific
services to enable one-to-one and group data communications between MCData
users.
The MCData architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services over LTE defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] and aspects
of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6], the Proximity-based
Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [8] defining MBMS support via the MB2 interface, the MBMS User
Service architecture defined in 3GPP TS 26.348 [19], the Security of the
Mission Critical Service in 3GPP TS 33.180 [13] and the PS-PS access transfer
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.237 [9] to enable support of the MCData
service.
The MCData UE primarily obtains access to the MCData service via E-UTRAN,
using the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4]. Certain application
functions of MCData service can be accessed using MCData UEs via non-3GPP
access networks.
The MCData system provides the function to support interworking with LMR
systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [18].
# 5 Architectural requirements
## 5.1 Transmission control
The MCData service supports the ability to transmit SDS messages automatically
towards the selected recipient user (private communication) or members of the
selected MCData group. The MCData server may still reject the sent message
(e.g. if there is no authority to send).
For MCData types other than SDS using signalling control plane, the MCData
service invokes a transmission request grant approach before data is permitted
to be transmitted. The MCData service provides configurable limits for the
maximum amount of data for and/or maximum amount of time that an MCData user
can transmit in a single request, which may be configured by the MCData
administrator.
For congestion control, related to transmission requests, the MCData service
may perform the following:
\- reject the data transmission requests and then shall notify the MCData user
of the rejection;
\- queue the data transmission requests; or
\- at any time, withhold the permission to transmit data automatically.
The MCData service shall notify the transmitting MCData group member if there
are no other MCData group members affiliated to the MCData group.
The MCData service supports the lossless communication, and it can be
configured by the MCData administrator for the private communication and group
communication. The lossless communication can be supported only if the user
has a valid and active MCData message store account. If the lossless
communication is configured for private communication and if the MCData
communication cannot be delivered to the MCData user (e.g. if the recipient is
not available at the time of data delivery or network congestion), it shall be
made available to the MCData user by storing it in the MCData user\'s personal
account in the MCData message store. If a MCData group is configured for
lossless communication, all members of the selected MCData group shall receive
the MCData communication, at a time dependent on affiliation status. An
affiliated group member of this MCData group shall receive the MCData
communication when they are sent. A group member that is not affiliated during
MCData communication, the MCData communication shall be made available by
storing it in the group member\'s personal account in the MCData message
store. If a MCData group is not configured for lossless communication, only
the affiliated members of the selected MCData group shall receive the MCData
communication.
In order to support lossless communication, below are the conditions that
needs to be satisfied:
\- Lossless communication is provisioned
\- MCData user has the valid MCData message store account
\- Store communication into message store configuration parameter is enabled
\- MCData user has requested to store the MCData communication into MCData
message store
## 5.2 Reception control
The MCData service shall support the ability to receive small amounts of data
automatically. The MCData service may store data waiting for delivery in a
temporary store, and notify availability to the receiving MCData users, i.e.
deferred delivery. The data which is temporarily stored may be configured with
\"time to live\" value, and subsequently, the data may be purged from the
temporary store upon expiry of \"time to live\".
When a MCData user has an active MCData message store account and has
activated lossless communication, the MCData service deferred delivery shall
not be used when the user is offline.
The recipient individual user (private communication) or affiliated members of
the MCData group(s) shall be notified of the list of available data either on
request or periodically.
The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for the MCData user to select
data to be downloaded from the list corresponding to the temporary store,
subject to limitations such as expiry time and size.
The MCData service shall support the ability to automatically deliver files
with a size less than a configured threshold value (i.e. auto-receive). The
data size for auto-receive shall be configured by the MCData administrator.
## 5.3 Short Data Service capability
The MCData service shall support SDS capability for one-to-one and group
communications.
The SDS capability shall support messages with a maximum payload of at least
1000 bytes. The supported message types shall include text, binary, or
hyperlinks. Multiple message types may be interleaved within in a single
message payload. The payload shall support inclusion of location information
of the sending MCData user, with or without user or application provided data.
The MCData service shall support messages to be sent over the signalling plane
or the media plane.
The SDS capability shall allow for multiple related messages to be correlated
and sequenced within the MCData service.
The MCData user shall be able to selectively request read and delivery receipt
indication for the sent messages. The message delivery history information
should be made available to an authorized MCData user.
The MCData service may support aggregation of disposition notifications when
SDS messages are sent to multiple recipients.
## 5.4 File distribution capability
The MCData service shall support distribution of files for one-to-one and
group communications.
The MCData service shall allow the MCData user to send a file or a URL of a
file to another MCData user. The source of the file can originate either from
an MCData client or from a network functional entity. The generated URL shall
be a reference to a stored file to allow for subsequent retrieval. The file
storage policy may determine the availability of the file to be retrieved, and
is subject to expiry time and size limitations.
When the file delivery request is set by the sending user to mandatory
download, the MCData service shall proceed to deliver the file to the
recipient when possible. The file distribution mechanisms shall support both
unicast and broadcast delivery methods.
The MCData service shall support aggregation of download completed reports
when files are distributed to multiple recipients.
The MCData service shall support mechanisms for detection and recovery of lost
data. A receiving MCData client should be able to:
\- detect and report when a transfer did not complete properly and request
retransmission;
\- identify and re-request the missing parts of an incompletely received file;
and
\- accept partial retransmissions and use them to reconstitute the original
file.
When employing MBMS delivery:
\- MCData may use the MB2 interface specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [8]. See also
Group Communication Delivery Method in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21]; or
\- if MBMS user services and Download Delivery Method (see 3GPP TS 26.346
[21]) are utilized, MCData shall use the xMB interface specified in 3GPP TS
26.348 [19].
For the MBMS path, figure 5.4-1 shows both the MB2 and the xMB interfaces.
Figure 5.4-1 MCData on-network architecture showing the unicast and MBMS
delivery paths
## 5.5 Data streaming capability
The MCData service may support data streaming capability for one-to-one and
group communications.
The MCData service may allow the MCData user to send a data stream or a URL of
a data stream to another MCData user. The source of the data stream can
originate either from an MCData client or from a network functional entity.
For a data stream originating at a network functional entity, the data stream
may be provided by an MCData user. The data streaming mechanisms shall support
both unicast and broadcast delivery methods.
When the data streaming request is set to automatic reception, the MCData
service may not require consent from the receiving MCData user.
The MCData user may be able to apply controls (i.e. start, stop, cancel) to
the streams, and on a per recipient basis.
The stream may be terminated through an explicit user control (i.e. stop,
cancel operation) or by reaching the end of the streamed content.
## 5.6 MCData group affiliation and MCData group de-affiliation
MCData groups may be configured with one or more MCData sub-services (e.g.
SDS, FD, DS) as specified within the MCData service. When an MCData user
affiliates to an MCData group, the MCData user is affiliated to each of those
MCData sub-services configured in the MCData group. The list of MCData sub-
services configured for an MCData group shall be included in the MCData group
configuration data.
MCData group affiliation shall be as specified in clause 5.2.5 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [5]. In addition, the following requirements shall be fulfilled by the
MCData service for MCData users affiliated to MCData groups:
\- MCData users receive notifications for participating in MCData sub-services
and invitations for their affiliated MCData group(s).
\- MCData users select an affiliated MCData group to initiate a new message,
file distribution, data stream, etc.
\- MCData users receive messages, files, data streams, enhanced status
updates, etc, from their affiliated MCData group(s).
## 5.7 Conversation management
The conversation management:
1\. shall include a service indication for conversation management in each SDS
and FD transaction.
2\. may be comprised of SDS transactions or FD transactions or a combination
of both.
3\. shall include a conversation identifier in each SDS and FD transaction.
4\. shall treat conversation between different set of users (either in one-to-
one or group) as a separate conversation.
5\. shall treat conversation between the same set of users (either in one-to-
one or group), but with a different conversation identifier as a separate
conversation.
## 5.8 Bearer management
### 5.8.1 General
The MCData UE shall use the APNs as defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 and table
A.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]. The MCData UE shall use the MC services APN as
defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 and table A.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] for the
SIP-1 reference point.
### 5.8.2 EPS bearer considerations
The EPS bearer considerations specified in subclause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[5] shall apply.
### 5.8.3 EPS unicast bearer considerations for MCData
For an MCData session request, resources shall be requested utilising
interaction with dynamic PCC. The MCData system shall request resources over
Rx to a PCRF. The dedicated bearer for MCData media shall utilise the QCI
value of 70 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [14]). The request of resources
over Rx shall include an application identifier for MCData in order for the
PCRF to evaluate the correct QCI.
The UE is required to support at minimum one bearer, which is used for MCData
(see annex A in 3GPP TS 36.331 [15]).
Depending on operator policy, for media plane:
\- the MCData system may be able to request modification of the priority (ARP)
of an existing bearer without the need to initiate a new dedicated GBR bearer;
or
\- the allocation of EPS bearers of desired priority for MCData communications
may cause the pre-emption of lower priority pre-emptible EPS bearers (for
MCData or for other applications), if the maximum number of bearers or maximum
traffic capacity has been reached, in favour of the newly initiated MCData EPS
bearer. In this case, if the new EPS bearer to be used for MCData
communication has higher priority level (ARP) than other bearer(s), is
allocated with a capability to pre-empt other bearers and the other bearer(s)
are pre-emptible, then the EPS bearer for MCData communication pre-empts one
(or more) of the existing EPS bearer(s).
NOTE: Operator policy takes into account regional/national requirements.
The EPS bearer(s) for MCData emergency communications shall have highest
priority level among MCData communication types. The EPS bearer(s) for MCData
imminent peril communications shall have higher priority level than for normal
MCData communications but lower than the priority level for MCData emergency
communications.
### 5.8.4 MBMS bearer management
The MBMS bearer management for MC services is specified in subclause 5.2.7.1
of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
## 5.9 Disposition
Disposition requests and notifications can be sent \"in-band\" using the same
mechanism used for transport of the data, or can be sent \"out-of-band\" when
the mechanism used for transport of the data is no longer available.
For standalone SDS and FD, the MCData UE shall use the signalling plane for
disposition request and disposition notifications. For session SDS, the MCData
UE shall use:
\- the media plane for disposition request and disposition notifications; and
\- the signalling plane for disposition notifications when the media plane is
no longer available.
## 5.10 MCData message store
MCData message store is used by MCData users to store their MCData
communications permanently; it shall provide secured storage area for each
authorized MCData user having a user account. The storage area is identified
by the MCData user\'s MCData ID. The MCData message store shall allow an
MCData user to access only the storage area that he is authorized to access. A
user (i.e. a dispatcher) other than the user account holder shall be able to
access the account holder\'s storage area if authorized.
During an active MCData communication, the participating function on the
MCData server of a MCData user participant shall, if the configuration to
store the MCData communication is enabled for and if requested by the MCData
user, deposit messages and files exchanged in the conversation to the MCData
user\'s storage area in the MCData message store. When depositing the MCData
communication into the MCData message store, if no such MCData user account is
available on the MCData message store the MCData server shall create the
user\'s account first and then deposit the MCData communications. The MCData
message store shall support user account creation and deposit MCData
communications operations from the MCData server after successful
authentication and authorization. The MCData message store shall support the
message store client to retrieve, update, delete, search and synchronize
MCData communications stored in the MCData message store, after successful
authentication and authorization.
The MCData user shall have an option if he wants to store the MCData
communications in the MCData message store or not. Based on the request from
MCData user, messages and files exchanged in an active MCData communication
shall be stored as objects in the MCData message store. A stored object shall
contain the following information:
1\. The message or file itself; and
2\. Associated metadata, consisting of:
a. information retrieved from the information elements of the message or file,
such as MCData IDs, Conversation identifier etc.; and
b. other information, such as content type (message or file), status
(\"seen\", \"received by\", \"read by \", \"downloaded by \" etc).
If a file is distributed indirectly with a URL in a message, when this message
is stored in the MCData user\'s account in the MCData message store, it could
be stored as:
1\. an object as the original message with the URL; or
2\. an object as the message with a revised URL that the URL indicates where
the file, retrieved from the MCData content server, is stored separately in
the MCData user\'s storage account. With proper security and authorization,
this URL can be accessible by other network entities such as the MCData
content server.
NOTE: It is the decision of SA3 on the mechanism to store an encrypted message
or file in the MCData message store.
When a MCData user logs onto a UE with successful authentication and
authorization and obtains the user service profile, the message store client
on the UE shall synchronize with the user\'s account on the MCData message
store, either automatically or manually (i.e. interacts with the user on which
option to synchronize or no synchronization at all), before any MCData service
starts.
## 5.11 IP connectivity (IPcon) capability
IP connectivity service enables the exchange of IP Data using MCData transport
service and provides the transport of IP Data for e.g. data hosts, servers,
etc. that do not have mission critical communication capabilities. The
exchange of IP Data is not limited in a transaction.
Figure 5.11-1: IP connectivity model
The corresponding MCData client enables bidirectional IP Data communication
with the support of the IP connectivity service and thus forms the gateway to
data hosts or servers. Therefore, the IP connectivity MCData client requests
the MCData transport service with the associated QoS requirement and
communication priority.
An authorised MCData client supporting IP connectivity capabilities is able to
bar incoming IP connectivity requests either on demand or by providing a list
of excluded origins identified by the MCData ID and, if available, by the
functional alias.
For IP connectivity, the MCData server may support following limitation to
exchange IP Data:
\- limit the total data volume between the authorized MCData clients, divided
by transmission and reception;
\- max time limit, e.g. total minutes or allow exchange between predefined
start and end time.
IP connectivity MCData service supports MCData transport services for one-to-
one and group communication.
The IP address allocation necessary for user-IP connectivity MCData transport
service is independent to the IP address allocation of the individual data
hosts attached with the MCData client supporting IP connectivity capabilities.
The required IP address pools for the user-IP connectivity MCData service are
managed by the IP connectivity MCData transport service.
NOTE: IP connectivity service on interworking is not covered in the current
specification.
## 5.12 MBMS user service architecture requirements
The MBMS user service architecture offers a set of delivery methods to
applications, specified in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21]. The MBMS download delivery
method is used for the delivery of files over MBMS and provides reliability
control by means of forward-error-correction.
The MCData File Distribution capability can use the MBMS download delivery
method by including, in the MC service-on network architecture (subclause
5.2.6 from 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]), the MBMS user service architecture (3GPP TS
26.346 [21]), with the MCData server assuming the role of the content
provider.
The MCData server may determine the MBMS broadcast area based on the cell
identities of the affiliated group members received over GC1.
When the xMB interface is used, the MCData server uses the xMB mission
critical extension, specified in 3GPP TS 26.348 [19] to control the QoS and
the MBMS broadcast area of the MBMS user services. The MCData server also
provides a file delivery manifest over xMB-C (see subclause 5.6.2 from 3GPP TS
26.348 [19]) describing the list of files to be broadcasted, and, for each
file, the target completion date and the number of repetitions.
The MBMS user service metadata, which provides the delivery and schedule
parameters, are returned to the MCData server after the MBMS session creation
or update, under the form of a SA file (annex L.3A from 3GPP TS 26.346 [21]).
The MCData server signals this SA file, together with the service id and the
uri of the file to be received to the targeted MCData clients.
NOTE: Use of service announcement channel to deliver MBMS user service
metadata is not covered in the current specification.
## 5.13 MBMS delivery via MB2 interface
MBMS delivery via MB2 applies to MCData services that use media plane for user
traffic delivery.
## 5.14 Delivery Notification
A MCData user may request a delivery report (such as delivered, message read,
or file downloaded etc.) when sending a MCData data (i.e. a message or a
file). The recipient((s) shall respond with the proper delivery status
response(s) (such as delivered, message read, or file downloaded etc.)
according to what is requested in the delivery report. The sender of the
MCData data may include multiple delivery status (such as delivered, message
read, or file downloaded etc.) in the delivery report and the recipient(s)
shall respond accordingly.
When the recipient is offline and receives a MCData data with request for
delivery report, the delivery status response(s) shall follow one of the two
principles below:
1\. If the deferred delivery is used to deliver the MCData data, the delivery
status response(s) shall be determined and responded by the recipient when the
data is delivered. The MCData server may send a provisional delivery status
report (such as the recipient is offline and the data will be delivered when
the recipient is online or discarded due to timeout etc.) to inform the sender
about the data delivery progress.
2\. If the data is delivered with lossless communication, the MCData server
shall respond with a delivered status report to the sender once the data is
deposited into the recipient\'s MCData message store account. If the message
read or file downloaded status is requested, the recipient shall respond it
when the data is synced on the user device and processed by the recipient.
5A Involved business relationships
The description of the involved business relationships for the MCData service
is contained in clause 6 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
# 6 Functional model
## 6.1 General
This clause defines the functional model for MCData service.
The security solution for the MCData service, including end-to-end encryption,
is specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [13].
## 6.2 Description of the planes
The functional model for the support of MCData is defined as a series of
planes to allow for the breakdown of the architectural description.
The description of the planes and the relationship between the planes are
contained in the common functional architecture to support MC services in 3GPP
TS 23.280 [5].
## 6.3 Transmission and reception control aspects
### 6.3.1 General
The transmission and reception control are functions of the MCData server.
For small data transmissions there is no need for prior grant of request to
transmit. The procedures in the present document describe when data is
automatically sent.
For large data transmissions, i.e. large files, the data is transmitted only
after request to transmit is granted. The data to be transmitted and/or
received may be stored in a data repository associated with the transmission
and reception control functions.
NOTE: An overview of transmission control process and possible arbitration
mechanisms is provided in the Annex B.
## 6.4 Generic functional model
### 6.4.1 On-network functional model
Figure 6.4.1-1 shows the generic application plane functional model.
Figure 6.4.1-1: Generic application plane functional model
In the model shown in figure 6.4.1-1, capability functions (SDS, FD, DS,
IPcon) of the MCData client and the MCData server along with their reference
points (MCData-cap-1 to MCData-cap-n) are described in the respective
functional models for each capability.
NOTE 1: The security aspects of new network components (MCData message store,
Message store client and MCData notification server) and the associated new
reference points are the responsibility of SA3 and thus outside the scope of
the present document.
An MCData server controls the signaling reference points and the corresponding
media allowing different paths for media and signalling.The MCData server
determines if it needs to stay in the media path based on the feature(s)
involved in the MCData communication, e.g., if the MCData message store is
required in the MCData communication, the MCData server shall remain in the
media path.
NOTE 2: If the MCData server is not in the MCData communication media path,
any implications regarding MC user data logging are left to implementation.
### 6.4.2 Off-network functional model
### 6.4.3 Functional entities description
Editor\'s note: Combining functional models describing each capability into
one functional model is FFS.
#### 6.4.3.1 Application plane
##### 6.4.3.1.1 MCData client
The MCData client functional entity acts as the user agent for all MCData
application transactions. The client supports SDS, file distribution, data
streaming and IP connectivity MCData capabilities utilized by MCData services
like conversation management, robots control, enhanced status, database
enquiries and secured internet.
##### 6.4.3.1.2 MCData server
The MCData server functional entity provides centralised support for MCData
services suite. Conversation management, robots, enhanced status, database
enquiries and secured internet MCData services requiring one-to-one or group
data communication are realized using SDS, file distribution, data streaming
and IP connectivity MCData communication capabilities.
All the MCData clients supporting users belonging to a single group are
required to use the same MCData server for that group. An MCData client
supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have relationships with
multiple MCData servers.
For MBMS delivery, the MCData server functional entity represents a specific
instantiation of the GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [8] to control
multicast and unicast operations for group communications.
If the MBMS user service architecture is utilized, the MCData server
functional entity represents a specific instantiation of the content provider
as described in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21] to control multicast operations for file
distribution.
The MCData server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS functional
entity of the signalling control plane.
The MCData server shall support the controlling role and the participating
role. The MCData server may perform the controlling role for one-to-one and
group data communication. The MCData server performing the controlling role
for a one-to-one or group data communication may also perform a participating
role for the same one-to-one or group data communication. For each one-to-one
and group data communication, there shall be only one MCData server assuming
the controlling role, while one or more MCData servers in participating role
may be involved.
The MCData server performing the controlling role is responsible for:
\- handling transmission and reception control (e.g. policy enforcement for
participation in the MCData group communication) towards all the MCData users
of the one-to-one and group data communication;
\- interfacing with the group management server for group policy and
affiliation status information of this MCData server\'s served affiliated
users;
\- managing SDS and FD data distribution during MCData group communication;
and
\- managing the MCData transport service for IP connectivity.
The MCData server performing the participating role is responsible for:
\- handling transmission control (e.g. authorization for participation in the
MCData group communication) to MCData users of the one-to-one and group data
communication;
\- group affiliation support for MCData user, including enforcement of maximum
Nc2 number of simultaneous group affiliations by a user;
\- interfacing with the group management server for group policy and
affiliation status information of this MCData server\'s served affiliated
users;
\- relaying the MCData communication messages between the MCData client and
the MCData server performing the controlling role; and
\- handling reception control (e.g. temporarily storing the data to present to
the MCData user as required) to its MCData users of the one-to-one and group
data communication.
NOTE: The MCData server in the controlling role and the MCData server in the
participating role can belong to the same MCData system.
##### 6.4.3.1.3 MCData user database
This functional entity contains information of the MCData user profile
associated with an MCData ID that is held by the MCData service provider at
the application plane. The MCData user profile is determined by the mission
critical organization, the MCData service provider, and potentially the MCData
user.
##### 6.4.3.1.4 Interworking function to LMR system
The functional entity is specified in 3GPP TS 23.283 [18].
##### 6.4.3.1.5 MC gateway server
The MC gateway server provides support for MCData interconnection services
with a partner MCData system in a different trust domain whilst providing
topology hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MCData servers in the
partner MCData system without needing to expose the MCData servers in the
primary MCData system outside the trusted domain of the primary MCData system.
It may be a role of the MCData server described in subclause 6.4.3.1.2 of the
present document.
The MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and
transmission control signalling messages, and media between MCData servers
within the MCData system and the interconnected MCData system.
#### 6.4.3.2 Signalling control plane
The description of the signalling control plane is contained in the common
functional architecture to support MC services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280
[5].
#### 6.4.3.3 MCData message store
The MCData message store is a network base persistent store that allows
Mission Critical Organization to configure their MCData users to permanently
store their MCData communications. Once configured a MCData user will be
allocated a secured storage area (i.e. size) in the MCData message store that
is only accessible by that configured MCData user and any authorized users.
The MCData user can manage how and what will be stored in his personal message
store with the support of management operations such as creating, deleting and
merging folders, moving stored messages and files around and synchronization
all used devices to provide the same contxt view etc.
NOTE: The security aspects of access and management (such as
read/write/update/sync etc.) of personal message store are the responsibility
of SA3 and thus outside the scope of the present document.
#### 6.4.3.4 Message store client
The Message store client is used to support MCData client to manage the MCData
communication history stored in MCData message store for a particular MCData
user, It supports the secure access to a MCData user\'s configured MCData
message store area and operations relevant to the stored communication history
such as folders management and synchronization to the device local message
store.
#### 6.4.3.5 MCData notification server
The MCData notification server provides the centralized notification function
in the network. The MCData notification server allows an application (e.g.
resident in the UE) to create a communication channel to receive real-time
notifications from the network in either Pull or Push mode. Depending on the
channel type created, the MCData notification server provides the application
a callback endpoint (i.e. URL) and may also provide a channel endpoint (i.e.
URL). The application communicates the callback endpoint information to the
application server (i.e. network enabler) for it to use in sending to the
MCData notification server the events for delivery to the application.
Depending on the type of channel created by the application the delivery of
the notifications from the MCData notification server to the application may
be via a Pull or Push method. If Pull method is used, then the application
shall use the provided channel endpoint to pull the notifications from the
MCData notification server. However, if a Push notification delivery is used,
then the MCData notification server asynchronously delivers the events
received from the application server to the application through a PUSH Enabler
server. The MCData notification server provides a consistent way to deliver
notifications by all services to reduce the complexity of service logic on the
application server.
It depends on deployment, if multiple MCData notification servers aredeployed.
#### 6.4.3.6 Message notification client
The Message notification client is used to request the notification service
from the MCData notification server. Once the notification service request is
authorized by the MCData notification server, the Message notification client
will communicate the callback endpoint, received from the MCData notification
server, to the MCData message store to be used for notification message
delivery.
When multiple MCData notification servers are deployed, the Message
notification client shall select one for notification service at any given
time. How the Message notification client selects the appropriate MCData
notification server from multiple available MCData notification servers for
service is implementation specific.

the MC gateway server in a different MCData system)
The MCData-9 reference point, which exists between the MC gateway server and
the MC gateway server in an interconnected MCData system for MCData
application signalling for establishing MCData sessions, shall use the SIP‑3
reference point for transport and routing of signalling. The MCData-9
reference point also carries application data where the data size is too great
to be transferred on the signalling plane.
##### 6.4.4.1.9 Reference point MCData-10 (between the Message notification
client and MCData notification server)
The MCData-10 reference point, which exists between the Message notification
client and the MCData notification server, is used by the Message notification

##### 6.6.3.1.2 Media storage client
The media storage client is used to support FD function of the MCData client
for file distribution capability. FD function of the MCData client interacts
with media storage client for uploading and downloading file to or from the
media storage function of the MCData content server.
##### 6.6.3.1.3 Transmission/Reception control
This functional entity is responsible for transmission and reception control
of MCData file data between the sending MCData UE, the MCData server, and the
receiving MCData UE. Transmission and reception control function is used to
provide arbitration between multiple data requests and apply the necessary
policy to ensure that appropriate data is transmitted between the MCData UE.
However, when the file distribution requests are exceeding a certain size, it
may be necessary to control the data that is transmitted or received by the
MCData UEs. The control is subject to criteria like application level
priorities (e.g. user priority, group priority), service type, emergency
nature of the communication, etc.
##### 6.6.3.1.4 Media storage function
The media storage function is responsible for the storing of media uploaded by
the media storage client of the MCData UE in case of MCData file distribution.
It also supports download of stored media by the MCData UE in case of file
distribution via media storage client.
The media storage function supports partial download requests of stored media
by the MCData UE via media storage client.
##### 6.6.3.1.5 MCData content server
The MCData content server functional entity provides a repository area in the
MCData trust domain allowing authorized MCData users to temporarily store
files that are intended to share to other MCData users. It provides common
pool of storage area (i.e. size) to all authorized MCData users to use, no
personal space is allocated. An authorized MCData user can use the supported
operations on the defined reference point to upload shared files and download
the files that are shared to him. The MCData server will use the defined
reference point to access the files stored in the MCData content server and
support the necessary operational functionalities. As part of the file life
cycle management the temporarily stored files will be removed periodically
based on the Mission Critical service provider policy. An MCData content
server may share files with another MCData content server in another MCData
system to support interconnection.
If the MBMS user service architecture described in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21] is
utilized for file distribution, the MCData content server provides the stored
file associated to the established MBMS session.

### 7.3.5 Use of MBMS user services for file distribution
#### 7.3.5.1 General
This subclause defines information flows and procedures for usage of MBMS user
services that applies to MCData file distribution. MBMS user services can be
used for any MC service group.
The MBMS user service architecture is described in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21].
NOTE: The current specification does not cover MCData end-to-end encryption
file distribution using MBMS when the BM-SC is in the MCData system trust
domain.
#### 7.3.5.2 Information flows for MBMS user service usage
##### 7.3.5.2.1 MBMS user service announcement
Table 7.3.5.2.1-1 describes the information flow MBMS bearer announcement from
the MCData server to the MCData client.
Table 7.3.5.2.1-1: MBMS user service announcement
Information element Status Description
* * *
MBMS user service id M Id of the MBMS user service SA file M The service
announcement file as returned in the create/update session response (subclause
5.4 in 3GPP TS 26.348 [19]) (see NOTE) Monitoring state O The monitoring state
is used to control if the client is actively monitoring the reception quality
or the MBMS bearer used by the MBMS user service. Unicast status O An
indication that the listening status of the unicast bearer is requested. NOTE:
The SA file provides the TMGI, the list of MBMS service area identifiers, the
frequency and the delivery parameters.
#### 7.3.5.3 Procedures for MBMS user service usage
##### 7.3.5.3.1 Use of pre-established MBMS user services
###### 7.3.5.3.1.1 General
In this scenario, the MCData server pre-establishes MBMS user service(s) in
certain pre-configured areas before the initiation of a group file
distribution. When a user originates a request for a file distribution in one
of these areas, the MCData server can use the pre-established MBMS user
service(s) for the DL media transmission.
The MBMS user service can be announced prior to the file distribution or
within the signalling message for the file distribution.
The MBMS user service does not transmit application level control signalling.
An MBMS bearer could be used for the application level control messages
according to the generic MBMS procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
###### 7.3.5.3.1.2 Procedure
Editor\'s note: The procedure in this clause needs to be revised considering
that MBMS user services, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21], cannot be
supported over the MB2 interface.
The procedure figure 7.3.5.3.1.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MCData
clients using an MBMS user service.
Pre-conditions:
\- The participating users are already affiliated.
Figure 7.3.5.3.1.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS user service
1\. The MCData server determines to create an MBMS user service with a given
MBMS user service id. If the MCData server makes use of the xMB interface, the
MCData server creates an MBMS user service over xMB-C (subclause 5.3 from 3GPP
TS 26.348 [19]).
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the creation of MBMS user services is
implementation specific.
2\. If the MCData server makes use of the xMB interface, the MCData server
creates an MBMS session over xMB-C for the MBMS user service (subclause 5.4
from 3GPP TS 26.348 [19]), with the type set to \"Files\" to use the MBMS
download delivery method. Additionally, the MCData server defines the ingest
mode, pull or push, to provide the file into the BM‑SC via xMB‑U. This MBMS
session will be used for file distribution. In response, the MCData server
gets the TMGI of the MBMS bearer used for the MBMS session, and the SA file
containing the metadata of the MBMS user service. When the push ingest mode is
used, as part of the response from the BM‑SC the MCData server also obtains
the URL to be used to push the file.
3a. Else, the MCData server activates an MBMS bearer over MB2-C for the MBMS
user service.
3b. The MCData server, if not already in the possession of the SA file,
generates the SA file containing the metadata of the MBMS user service.
4\. The MCData server passes using control plane signalling the MBMS user
service info for the service description associated with the pre-established
MBMS user service to the MCData client. The MCData client obtains the TMGI,
identifying the MBMS bearer, from the SA file included in the MBMS user
service description.
5\. The MCData client stores the information associated with the MBMS user
service. The MCData client uses the TMGI and other MBMS user service related
information to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer.
6\. The MCData client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the MCData server that the MCData client is able
to receive file distributed over MBMS, whereby the MCData server may decide to
use this MBMS user service instead of unicast bearer for MC communication
sessions.
NOTE 2: Step 4 is optional for the MCData UE on subsequent MBMS user service
announcements.
NOTE 3: The information flow is specified in subclause 10.7.2.2 from 3GPP TS
23.280 [5].
7\. If the MCData server makes use of the xMB interface and wants to deliver a
file to a group, the MCData server updates the MBMS session to provide the
file list when the pull ingest mode is defined. As described in 3GPP TS 26.348
[19], the file list includes, among other information, the file URL to be used
by the BM‑SC to fetch the file and the earliest fetch time.
8\. The MCData server signals the file transmission over the MBMS user service
to the targeted MCData clients.
NOTE 4: After step 8, the file can be provided for distribution over the MBMS
session. If the pull ingest mode is defined, the BM‑SC fetches the file from
the indicated file URL. If the push ingest mode is defined, the MCData server
can start pushing the file to the corresponding URL.
9\. The file, transmitted with the MBMS download delivery method, is received
by the MCData clients. If the MCData server does not make use of the xMB
interface, the MCData server fragments the file to be sent, applies error
correction according to the MBMS download delivery method (3GPP TS 26.346
[21]) and sent the FLUTE packets over MB2-U.
##### 7.3.5.3.2 Use of dynamic MBMS user service establishment
Editor\'s note: The procedure in this clause needs to be revised considering
that MBMS user services, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.346 [21], cannot be
supported over the MB2 interface.
In this scenario depicted in figure 7.3.5.3.2-1, the MCData server decides to
establish an MBMS user service for the distribution of a given file. The MBMS
user service is announced to the MCData client, together with the file
information to be received.
NOTE 1: The MCData server logic for determining when to establish the new MBMS
user service is implementation specific. For example, the MCData server could
decide to establish the MBMS delivery based on the location of the UE\'s that
are a part of the targeted group.
Figure 7.3.5.3.2-1: Use of dynamic MBMS user service establishment
1\. The MCData server determines to create a MBMS user service with a given an
MBMS user service id for the group communication session. If the MCData server
makes use of the xMB interface, the MCData server creates an MBMS user service
over xMB-C (subclause 5.3 from 3GPP TS 26.348 [19]).
2\. If the MCData server makes use of the xMB interface, the MCData server
creates a MBMS session for the MBMS user service (subclause 5.4 from 3GPP TS
26.348 [19]), with the type set to \"Files\" to use the MBMS download delivery
method. Additionally, the MCData server defines the ingest mode, pull or push,
to provide the file into the BM‑SC via xMB‑U. When the pull ingest mode is
defined, the MCData server provides the file list. The file list includes,
among other information, the file URL to be used by the BM‑SC to fetch the
file and the earliest fetch time. In response, the MCData server gets the TMGI
of the MBMS bearer used for the MBMS session and the SA file containing the
metadata of the MBMS user service. When the pull ingest mode is defined, the
MCData server also obtains the scheduling parameter for the file delivery.
When the push ingest mode is used, as part of the response from the BM‑SC the
MCData server obtains the URL to be used to push the file.
3a. Else, the MCData server activates an MBMS bearer over MB2-C for the MBMS
user service.
3b. The MCData server, if not already in the possession of the SA file,
generates the SA file containing the metadata of the MBMS user service.
4\. The MCData server passes using control plane signalling the SA file to the
MCData client. The MCData client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS
bearer, from the SA file included in the MBMS user service description.
5\. The MCData client stores the information associated with the MBMS user
service. The MCData client uses the TMGI and other MBMS user service related
information to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer.
6\. The MCData client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the MCData server that the MCData client is able
to receive file distributed over MBMS, whereby the MCData server may decide to
use this MBMS user service instead of unicast bearer for MC communication
sessions.
7\. The MCData server signals the file transmission over the MBMS user service
to the targeted MCData clients.
NOTE 2: After step 7, the file can be provided for distribution over the MBMS
session. If the pull ingest mode is defined, the BM‑SC fetches the file from
the indicated file URL. If the push ingest mode is defined, the MCData server
can start pushing the file to the corresponding URL.
8\. The file, transmitted with the MBMS download delivery method, is received
by the MCData clients. If the MCData server does not make use of the xMB
interface, the MCData server fragments the file to be sent, applies error
correction according to the MBMS download delivery method (3GPP TS 26.346
[21]) and sent the FLUTE packets over MB2-U.
##### 7.3.5.3.3 Providing stored files in the MCData content server for
distribution over MBMS
###### 7.3.5.3.3.1 General
As described in clause 6.6.3.1.5, the MCData content server provides a
repository area where authorized MCData users temporarily store files that are
intended to be shared with other MCData users. The distribution of such files
targeting a group of MCData users can be performed over MBMS.
For the case that the MBMS user service architecture is used over the xMB
interface (specified in 3GPP TS 26.348 [19]), two ingest modes, push and pull,
can be defined by the MCData server to ingest the file into the BM‑SC for
distribution over the MBMS sessions.
NOTE: It is implementation specific if the MCData server uses pull or push
ingest mode to ingest the file into the BM‑SC over the xMB interface.
###### 7.3.5.3.3.2 File fetching by the MCData server
A file can be fetched by the MCData server from the MCData content server over
the MCData-FD-5 reference point using the file URL provided by MCData users.
The MCData server, thus, enables via the xMB‑U interface that the file is
ingested, either by pull or push, into the BM‑SC for distribution over MBMS.
NOTE 1: The file also becomes available for the case that the MCData server
decides to distribute the file over the MB2 interface to MCData users from the
target MCData group.
When the MCData server defines a pull ingest mode, the MCData server provides
via the xMB‑C interface the resource location from which the BM‑SC will fetch
the file as well as other session properties (e.g. file earliest fetch time),
as described in 3GPP TS 26.348 [19].
When the MCData server defines a push ingest mode, the MCData server directly
ingests into the BM‑SC via the xMB‑U interface the file obtained from the
MCData content server. The BM‑SC provides to the MCData server the URL to be
used to push the file(s).
NOTE 2: For the push ingest mode, the MCData server is always the functional
entity ingesting the file content into the BM‑SC via the xMB‑U interface.
The procedure in figure 7.3.5.3.3.2-1 describes the case where the file to be
distributed over MBMS is fetched by the MCData server from the MCData content
server.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCData users on the MCData client 1 to n belong to the same MCData
group and are already registered and affiliated for receiving MCData service.
\- The file to be distributed is uploaded to the MCData content server.
\- The BM‑SC has the necessary permissions to fetch a file from the MCData
system.
Figure 7.3.5.3.3.2-1: File fetching by the MCData server for file distribution
over MBMS
1\. The MCData server receives a request from the MCData client 1 to
distribute a file to a target MCData group. The MCData file distribution
request contains the resource location (i.e. the file URL) in the MCData
content server.
2\. The MCData server decides to fetch the file from the MCData content server
via the MCData-FD-5 reference point.
3\. The MCData server creates an MBMS service and session for file delivery
using xMB procedures via the xMB‑C interface, as described in 3GPP TS 26.348
[19]. The MCData server indicates, among other session properties, the ingest
mode. For the case of pull ingest mode, the MCData server provides the file
URL from which the BM‑SC will fetch the file. For the case of push ingest
mode, the BM‑SC provides to the MCData server the URL to be used to push the
file into the MBMS session.
NOTE 3: Step 3 may also occur before step 2.
4\. The MCData server provides to the MCData users from the target MCData
group the application signalling related to the MBMS session and the file
distribution.
5a. For the case that the file is ingested into the BM‑SC based on the push
ingest mode, the MCData server pushes the file to the URL indicated by the
BM‑SC.
5b. For the case that the file is ingested into the BM‑SC based on the pull
ingest mode, the BM‑SC pulls the file from the provided file URL.
6\. The BM‑SC distributes the file over the established MBMS session. When the
target MCData clients have activated the reception for that service and are
located within the MBMS area coverage, the MCData clients receive the file.
###### 7.3.5.3.3.3 File fetching by the BM‑SC
When the MCData server defines a pull ingest mode, the MCData server can
alternatively provide to the BM‑SC the resource location in the MCData content
server (i.e. the file URL contained within the received file distribution
request). The BM‑SC, thus, will directly fetch the file from the MCData
content server.
NOTE 1: In order to the enable that the BM‑SC fetches the file from the MCData
content server, the MCData content server supports the xMB‑U interface to the
BM‑SC.
NOTE 2: For the case that the file is ingested into the BM‑SC from the MCData
content server, only the pull ingest mode is supported. When push ingest mode
is required, the procedure is described in clause 7.3.5.3.3.2.
The procedure in figure 7.3.5.3.3.3-1 describes the case where the file to be
distributed over MBMS is fetched by the BM‑SC from the MCData content server.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCData users on the MCData client 1 to n belong to the same MCData
group and are already registered and affiliated for receiving MCData service.
\- The file to be distributed is uploaded to the MCData content server.
\- The BM‑SC has the necessary permissions to fetch a file from the MCData
system.
Figure 7.3.5.3.3.3-1: File fetching by the BM‑SC for file distribution over
MBMS
1\. The MCData server receives a request from the MCData client 1 to
distribute a file to a target MCData group. The MCData file distribution
request contains the resource location (i.e. the file URL) in the MCData
content server.
2\. The MCData server creates an MBMS service and session for file delivery
using xMB procedures via the xMB‑C interface, as described in 3GPP TS 26.348
[19]. The MCData server defines, among other session properties, the ingest
mode to pull. The MCData server provides the file URL from which the BM‑SC
will fetch the file from the MCData content server.
3\. The MCData server provides to the MCData users from the target MCData
group the application signalling related to the MBMS session and the file
distribution.
4\. The BM‑SC fetches the file from the MCData content server via the xMB‑U
interface.
5\. The BM‑SC distributes the file over the established MBMS session. When the
target MCData clients have activated the reception for that service and are
located within the MBMS area coverage, the MCData clients receive the file.
### 7.3.6 Group communication connect and disconnect over MBMS bearer
procedures
#### 7.3.6.1 General
MBMS bearer can be used for MCData group communication. One MBMS bearer is not
permanently associated to one specific group or group communication. Before
sending data packets of a group communication over MBMS bearer, the MCData
server shall send the association information between group communication and
the MBMS bearer. The group session setup procedure indicates the media stream
within one MBMS bearer that is used for the specific group communication. When
the group communication over the MBMS bearer is finished, this temporary
association information of an MCPTT group communication to specific resources
on a MBMS bearer is undone.The procedure in clause 7.3.6 requires that the
group session is setup before the data transmission starts. This eliminates
the need for the receiving clients to continuously use a unicast bearer. Prior
to group session setup, the MBMS bearer is activated and announced to the
MCData clients.
NOTE: It is implementation-specific that one MBMS bearer can be re-assigned to
different groups, or is associated to only one group.
#### 7.3.6.2 Procedure
The procedure in this clause uses an establishment of group communication as
described in clause 7.4.2.7. Similary, the procedure defined in this clause is
also applicable for the group communication established as described in clause
7.4.2.6.
##### 7.3.6.2.1 Group communication connect over MBMS bearer
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCData clients 1 to n are registered and affiliated to the same MCData
group X.
\- The MCData server has decided to use an MBMS bearer for the MCData service
group communication associated with to the MCData group X.
Figure 7.3.6.2.1-1: Group communication connect on MBMS bearer.
1\. Activation and announcement of MBMS bearer availability.
NOTE 1: The procedure does not include the steps for MCData client location
reporting, or for MBMS capability information exchange.
2\. The MCData client 1 initiates a group communication by sending a MCData
group data request over a unicast PDN connection towards the MCData server.
3\. MCData server initiates the MCData group data request towards each MCData
clients 2 to n.
4\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n optionally notify the user about the
incoming MCData session data request.
5\. The receiving MCData client 2 to n accept or reject the MCData group data
request and the corresponding result is in the MCData group data response
towards MCData server.
6\. The MCData server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the communication over an
MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information
between the group communication and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message
includes MCData group ID and information about the media stream identifier of
the activated MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of
the MBMS bearer broadcasting the communication.
7\. The MCData clients 2 to n process the MapGroupToBearer information and may
send a MapGroupToBearer Ack back to the MCData server if required.
8\. MCData server forwards the MCData group data response received from MCData
client 2 to n to the MCData user initiating the MCData session data request.
NOTE 2: The steps 3 to 5 and steps 6 to 7 can occur in any order, and prior to
step 9 depending on the conditions to proceed with the data transmission.
9\. MCData client 1 sends the MC data over uplink unicast PDN connection
towards the MCData server.
10\. The MCData server sends the MC data over the indicated stream within the
associated MBMS bearer to the MCData clients 2 to n.
##### 7.3.6.2.2 Group communication disconnect from MBMS bearer
Figure 7.3.6.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure where an
UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCData server to the MCData
clients to indicate that the MCData group communication is being dissociated
from the MBMS bearer.
Figure 7.3.6.2.2-1: Group communication disconnect on MBMS bearer.
1\. The MC group communication is taking place over MBMS bearer. MCData client
1 is sending the MC data over a unicast PDN connection to the MCData server.
2\. The MCData server sends the MC data over the MBMS bearer to MCData clients
2 to n.
3\. After the MC data transmission is over, i.e., no further data to be sent
over the group communication, the MCData server sends an UnMapGroupFromBearer
to de-associate the group communication from the MBMS bearer.
## 7.4 Short data service
### 7.4.1 General
There are several procedures how an SDS message can be transported from the
sender to the recipient. All of the following factors are used by MCData
client for selecting appropriate SDS procedures:
\- Whether the data to transfer is within or outside the SDS data size limit
to transport over signalling control plane;
\- Whether the MCData user has only one SDS transaction or multiple SDS
transactions;
\- Whether MCData user, optionally using its associated and activated
functional alias, is targeting SDS transaction to another MCData user or
MCData group;
\- Whether MCData UE is on-network or off-network; and
\- Security reasons.
### 7.4.2 Short data service for on-network
The procedures described in the following subclauses are limited to single
MCData system only.

#### 7.4.2.2 One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.2.2.1 General
A MCData user initiates a standalone SDS data transfer with another MCData
user. For the SDS data transfer signalling plane is used. The target MCData
user may be addressed using the functional alias that can be shared with other
MCData users.
##### 7.4.2.2.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.2.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating one-to-one MCData data communication for sending standalone SDS
data to other MCData user, with or without disposition request. Standalone
refers to sending unidirectional data in one transaction.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The SDS payload data size is below the configured maximum payload data
size for SDS over signalling control plane.
2\. MCData users on MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCData service.
3\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 belong to the same MCData system.
4\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
5\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.2.2-1: One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling
control plane
1\. The user at MCData client 1 initiates an SDS data transfer for the chosen
MCData user.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData standalone data request towards the MCData
server. The MCData standalone data request contains conversation identifier
for message thread indication. The MCData standalone data request may include
additional implementation specific information in the application metadata
container. The MCData standalone data request may contain disposition request
if indicated by the user at MCData client 1. MCData user at MCData client 1
may include a functional alias within the SDS data transfer and addresses the
target MCData client 2 using a functional alias.
a) If the MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
short data service communication or MCData emergency state is already set for
the MCData client 1 (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData standalone data request shall contain emergency indicator; and
ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client 1 is
retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData standalone data request. MCData server verifies
whether the provided functional alias of MCData client 1, if present, can be
used and has been activated for the user. The MCData server also checks
whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or
content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege or
affiliation. If functional alias is used to address that target MCData user,
the MCData server resolves the functional alias to the corresponding MCData
ID(s) for which the functional alias is active and proceed with step 4
otherwise proceed with step 6. The MCData server allows only two participating
MCData clients for a standalone short data service.
NOTE 2: The MCData server prioritizes the MCData emergency communication over
the other MCData communication. How the MCData server prioritizes MCData
emergency communication is not in the scope of the present document.
NOTE 3: If the MCData server detects that the functional alias used as the
target of the SDS data transfer request is simultaneously active for multiple
MCData users, then the MCData server can proceed by selecting an appropriate
MCData ID based on some selection criteria. The selection of an appropriate
MCData ID is left to implementation. These selection criteria can include
rejection of the SDS data transfer request, if no suitable MCData ID is
selected.
4\. The MCData server responds back to MCData client 1 with a functional alias
resolution response message that contains the resolved MCData ID.
5\. If the MCData server replies with a MCData functional alias resolution
response message, the MCData client 1 assumes the MCData standalone data
request in step 2 is rejected and sends a new MCData standalone data request
towards the resolved MCData ID.
6\. MCData server initiates the MCData standalone data request towards the
MCData user that is determined based on step 3. The MCData standalone data
request towards the MCData user contains the emergency indicator if it is
present in the received MCData standalone data request from MCData client 1.
NOTE 4: MCData client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCData standalone data request containing the emergency
indicator.
7\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData client
2 may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for MCData user
consumption, then the MCData user of MCData client 2 shall not be notified.
The action taken when the payload contains application data or command
instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload. Payload
content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known local non-
MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the MCData client 2 to
start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start application) and
shall pass the payload content to the just started application.
8\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report. The MCData data disposition
notification from MCData client may be stored by the MCData server for
disposition history interrogation from authorized MCData users.

#### 7.4.2.3 One-to-one standalone short data service using media plane
##### 7.4.2.3.1 General
A MCData user initiates a standalone SDS data transfer with another MCData
user. For the SDS data transfer media plane is used. The target MCData user
may be addressed using the functional alias that can be shared with other
MCData users.
##### 7.4.2.3.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.3.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating one-to-one MCData data communication for sending standalone SDS
data to other MCData user, with or without disposition request. Standalone
refers to sending unidirectional data in one transaction. The SDS payload data
size is assumed to be above the configured maximum payload data size for SDS
over signalling control plane.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCData service.
2\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 belong to the same MCData system.
3\. Optionally, the MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be
used.
4\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.3.2-1: One-to-one standalone short data service using media plane
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate an SDS data transfer
request for the chosen MCData user.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData standalone session data request towards the
MCData server. The MCData standalone session data request contains one MCData
user for one-to-one data communication as selected by the user at MCData
client 1. The MCData standalone session data request contains conversation
identifier for message thread indication. The MCData standalone session data
request may include additional implementation specific information in the
application metadata container. The MCData data request may contain
disposition request if indicated by the user at MCData client 1. MCData user
at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within the SDS data transfer
and addresses the target MCData client 2 using a functional alias.
a) If the MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
short data service communication or MCData emergency state is already set for
the MCData client 1 (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData standalone session data request shall contain emergency
indicator; and
ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client 1 is
retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData standalone session data request. MCData server
verifies whether the provided functional alias of MCData client 1, if present,
can be used and has been activated for the user. The MCData server also checks
whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or
content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege.
MCData server determines the eligible MCData user(s) after policy assertion
for sending the MCData standalone session data request. If functional alias is
used to address that target MCData user, the MCData server resolves the
functional alias to the corresponding MCData ID(s) for which the functional
alias is active and proceed with step 4 otherwise proceed with step 6. The
resulting list contains all associated MCData IDs/MCData users that share this
functional alias. The MCData server allows only two participating MCData
clients for a standalone short data service.
NOTE 2: The MCData server prioritizes the MCData emergency communication over
the other MCData communication. How the MCData server prioritizes MCData
emergency communication is not in the scope of the present document.
4\. The MCData server responds back to MCData client 1 with a functional alias
resolution response message that contains the resolved MCData ID.
NOTE 3: If the MCData server detects that the functional alias used as the
target of the MCData standalone session data request is simultaneously active
for multiple MCData users, then the MCData server can proceed by selecting an
appropriate MCData ID based on some selection criteria. The selection of an
appropriate MCData ID is left to implementation. These selection criteria can
include rejection of the MCData standalone session data request, if no
suitable MCData ID is selected.
5\. If the MCData server replies with a MCData functional alias resolution
response message, the MCData client 1 abandons the MCData standalone session
data request in step 2 and sends a new MCData standalone session data request
towards the resolved MCData ID.
6\. MCData server initiates the MCData standalone session data request towards
the MCData users determined. The MCData standalone session data request
towards the MCData user contains an emergency indicator if it is present in
the received MCData standalone session data request from MCData client 1.
NOTE 4: MCData client 2 corresponds to the MCData user(s) after resolution of
the functional alias.
NOTE 5: MCData client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCData standalone session data request containing the emergency
indicator.
7\. The receiving MCData client 2 automatically accepts the MCData standalone
session data request and responds with MCData standalone session data response
towards MCData server.
8\. MCData server forwards the MCData client 2 accepted response to the MCData
Client 1 initiating the MCData standalone session data request.
9\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 have successfully established media
plane for data communication and the MCData client 1 transmits the SDS data.
> 10\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
> data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData
> client 2 may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for MCData user
> consumption, then the MCData user of MCData client 2 shall not be notified.

12\. MCData data disposition notification is sent to the disposition
requesting user at MCData client 1.
> 13\. If the MCData disposition for read was requested by the user at MCData

#### 7.4.2.4 One-to-one short data service session
##### 7.4.2.4.1 General
A MCData user triggers an establishment of a MCData session with another
MCData user for the exchange of SDS data. The target MCData user may be
addressed using the functional alias that can be shared with other MCData
users.
##### 7.4.2.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.4.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating data communication session with another MCData user for exchanging
at least one SDS data transaction between them, with or without disposition
request using MCData-SDS-1 and MCData-SDS-2 or MCData-SDS-3 reference points.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCData service.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.4.2-1: One-to-one short data service session
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate an SDS data communication
session request for the chosen MCData user.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData session data request towards the MCData
server. The MCData session data request contains one MCData user for one-to-
one data communication as selected by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData
session data request contains conversation identifier for message thread
indication. The MCData session data request may include additional
implementation specific information in the application metadata container.
MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within the SDS
data transfer and addresses the target MCData client 2 using a functional
alias.
a) If the MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
short data service communication or MCData emergency state is already set for
the MCData client 1 (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData session data request shall contain emergency indicator; and
ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client is
retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData session data request. The MCData server also checks
whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or
content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege.
MCData server determines the eligible MCData user(s) after policy assertion
for sending the MCData session data request. MCData server also verifies
whether the provided functional alias of MCData client 1, if present, can be
used and has been activated for the user. If functional alias is used to
address that target MCData user, the MCData server resolves the functional
alias to the corresponding MCData ID(s) for which the functional alias is
active and proceed with step 4 otherwise proceed with step 6. The MCData
server allows only two participating MCData clients for a standalone short
data service.
NOTE 2: The MCData server prioritizes the MCData emergency communication over
the other MCData communication. How the MCData server prioritizes MCData
emergency communication is not in the scope of the present document.
NOTE 3: If the MCData server detects that the functional alias used as the
target of the MCData session data request is simultaneously active for
multiple MCData users, then the MCData server can proceed by selecting an
appropriate MCData ID based on some selection criteria. The selection of an
appropriate MCData ID is left to implementation. These selection criteria can
include rejection of the SDS data transfer request, if no suitable MCData ID
is selected.
4\. The MCData server responds back to MCData client 1 with a functional alias
resolution response message that contains the resolved MCData ID.
5\. If the MCData server replies with a MCData functional alias resolution
response message, the MCData client 1 abandons the MCData session data request
in step 2 and sends a new MCData session data request towards the resolved
MCData ID.
6\. MCData server initiates the MCData session data request towards the MCData
users determined. The MCData session data request towards the MCData user
contains the emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData
session data request from MCData client 1.
NOTE 4: MCData client 2 corresponds to the MCData user(s) after resolution of
the functional alias.
NOTE 5: MCData client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCData session data request containing the emergency indicator.
7\. If the emergency indicator is present, the receiving MCData client 2
notifies the user about the incoming MCData session data request.
8\. The receiving MCData client 2 accepts the MCData session data request and
responds with MCData session data response towards MCData server.
9\. MCData server forwards the MCData client 2 accepted response to the MCData
user initiating the MCData session data request.
10\. and 11. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 have successfully established
media plane for data communication and either MCData client can transmit SDS
data. The MCData data request may contain disposition request if indicated by
the client sending data. If MCData data disposition was requested by the user,
then the receiving MCData client initiates a MCData data disposition
notification for delivery, read reports to the disposition requesting user.
The MCData data disposition notification from MCData user may be stored by the
MCData server for disposition history interrogation from authorized users.
12\. and 13. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not
application data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of
MCData client 2 may be notified, otherwise the MCData user of MCData client 2
shall not be notified.
14\. After SDS data transaction is complete, the established media plane is
released.
#### 7.4.2.5 Group standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.2.5.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone SDS to a selected group results in
affiliated group members receiving the SDS data. The SDS payload data size is
assumed to be below the configured maximum payload data size for SDS over
signalling control plane.
##### 7.4.2.5.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.5.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating group standalone MCData data communication with or without
disposition request, to a group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData clients 1 to n belong to the same group and are
already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.5.2-1: Group standalone SDS using signalling control plane
1\. The user at MCData client 1 initiates an SDS data transfer to multiple
MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by MCData group ID)
and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group standalone data request towards the
MCData server. The MCData group data request contains MCData group ID as
selected by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData group standalone data
request contains conversation identifier for message thread indication. The
MCData session data request may include additional implementation specific
information in the application metadata container. The MCData group standalone
data request may contain disposition request if indicated by the user at
MCData client 1. MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias
within the SDS data transfer.
> If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency short
> data service communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for
> the MCData client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group standalone data request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii) the MCData group standalone data request shall set an alert indicator if
configured to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an MCData
standalone data request for the emergency short data service communication;
iii) if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets
its MCData emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled; and
iv) once an MCData emergency communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until cancelled.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril short
data service communication:
i) the MCData group standalone data request shall contain imminent peril
indicator; and
ii) once an MCData imminent peril communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled.
2a. If either emergency indicator or imminent peril indicator is present in
the received MCData group standalone data request, the MCData server
implicitly affiliates MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not
already affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group standalone data request. The MCData server
resolves the MCData group ID to determine the members of that group and their
affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server.
The MCData server also checks whether any policy is to be asserted to limit
certain types of message or content to certain members due, for example, to
location or user privilege or affiliation. MCData server also verifies whether
the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated
for the user.
i) If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
emergency state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
emergency state until cancelled; and
ii) If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
imminent peril state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until cancelled.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone data request towards
each MCData client determined in Step 3. The MCData ID list shall not be
included in a unicast downlink delivery to an individual MCData client. The
Disposition Type IE shall not be included in a unicast downlink delivery to
MCData clients who are not in the MCData ID list in step 2. The MCData group
standalone data request towards each MCData client contains:
i) an emergency indicator, if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone data request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator, if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone data request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator, if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group standalone data request from the MCData client 1.
5\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData
clients 2 to n may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for MCData
user consumption, then the MCData user of MCData clients 2 to n shall not be
notified. The action taken when the payload contains application data or
command instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload.
Payload content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known
local non-MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the MCData
client 2 to start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start
application) and shall pass the payload content to the just started
application.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client(s) initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
7\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.
NOTE 1: On receiving MCData group standalone data request over MBMS, the
receiving MCData client(s) shall check if the MCData ID list IE is included
the receiving MCData client shall check if its own MCData ID is in the list.
If not, step 6 and 7 are not required.
8\. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from MCData client may be
stored by the MCData server for disposition history interrogation from
authorized MCData users. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
9\. Aggregated or individual MCData data disposition notification(s) is sent
to the disposition requesting user at MCData client 1.
#### 7.4.2.6 Group standalone short data service using media plane
##### 7.4.2.6.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone SDS to a selected group results in
affiliated group members receiving the SDS data. The SDS payload data size is
assumed to be above the configured maximum payload data size for SDS over
signalling control plane.
##### 7.4.2.6.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.6.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating group standalone MCData data communication with or without
disposition request to a group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData client 1 to n belong to the same group and are
already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.6.2-1: Group standalone SDS using media plane
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate a SDS data transfer request
to multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by
MCData group ID) and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group session standalone data request
towards the MCData server. The MCData group session standalone data request
contains target recipient(s) as selected by the user at MCData client 1. The
MCData session group standalone data request contains conversation identifier
for message thread indication. The MCData session group standalone data
request may include additional implementation specific information in the
application metadata container. The MCData session group standalone data
request may contain disposition request if indicated by the user at MCData
client 1. MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within
the SDS data transfer.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency short data
service communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for MCData
client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group session standalone data request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii) the MCData group session standalone data request shall set the alert
indicator if configured to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an
MCData standalone data request for the emergency short data service
communication;
iii) if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets
its MCData emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled; and
iv) once an MCData emergency communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until cancelled.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril short
data service communication:
i) the MCData group session standalone data request shall contain an imminent
peril indicator; and
ii) once an MCData imminent peril communication has been initiated, the MCData
group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled.
2a. If either an emergency indicator or an imminent peril indicator is present
in received MCData group session standalone data request, the MCData server
implicitly affiliates MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not
already affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData session group standalone data request. The MCData
server resolves the MCData group ID to determine the members of that group and
their affiliation status, based on the information from the group management
server. The MCData server also checks whether any policy is to be asserted to
limit certain types of message or content to certain members due, for example,
to location or user privilege. MCData server also verifies whether the
provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for
the user.
i) if an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group session
standalone data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
emergency state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
emergency state until cancelled; and
ii) if an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
session standalone data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-
progress imminent peril state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-
progress imminent peril state until cancelled.
3a. The MCData server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for
all participants in the MCData group.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData group session standalone data request
towards each MCData user determined in Step 3. The MCData ID list shall not be
included in a unicast downlink delivery to an individual MCData client. The
Disposition Type IE shall not be included in a unicast downlink delivery to
MCData clients who are not in the MCData ID list in step 2. The MCData group
session standalone data request towards each MCData client contains:
i) an emergency indicator, if it is present in the received MCData group
session standalone data request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator, if it is present in the received MCData group
session standalone data request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator, if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group session standalone data request from MCData client 1.
5\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n automatically accepts the MCData group
session standalone data request and responds with MCData group standalone data
response towards MCData server.
6\. MCData server forwards the MCData clients 2 to n accepted response to the
MCData user initiating the MCData group session standalone data request.
NOTE 1: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 7
depending on the conditions to proceed with the data transmission.
7\. MCData client 1 and MCData server have successfully established media
plane for data communication and the MCData client 1 transmits the SDS data.
8\. MCData server distributes the data received from MCData client 1 to MCData
clients 2 to n over the established media plane. After completion of the
MCData transfer from MCData client 1, media plane resources associated to the
data communication are released.
NOTE 2: MCData server is not required to wait for the complete reception of
SDS data from MCData client 1 prior to initiating transmission to MCData
client 2 to n.
9\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData client
2 to n may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for MCData user
consumption, then the MCData user of MCData client 2 to n shall not be
notified. The action taken when the payload contains application data or
command instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload.
Payload content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known
local non-MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the MCData
client 2 to start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start
application) and shall pass the payload content to the just started
application.
10\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client(s) initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
11\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.
NOTE 3: On receiving MCData group standalone data request over MBMS, the
receiving MCData client(s) shall check if the MCData ID list IE is included
the receiving MCData client shall check if its own MCData ID is in the list.
If not, step 6 and 7 are not required.
12\. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from MCData client may be
stored by the MCData server for disposition history interrogation from
authorized MCData users. The MCData data disposition notification(s) from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
13\. Aggregated or individual MCData data disposition notification(s) is sent
to the disposition requesting user at MCData client 1.

1\. MCData users on MCData client 1 to n belong to the same group and are
already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.4.2.7.2-1: Group SDS session
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate a SDS group data transfer
request to multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified
by MCData group ID) and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group data request towards the MCData
server. The MCData group data request contains MCData group ID as selected by
the user at MCData client 1. The MCData session data request contains
conversation identifier for message thread indication. The MCData group data
request may include additional implementation specific information in the
application metadata container. MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a
functional alias within the SDS data transfer.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency short data
service communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for the
MCData client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group data request shall contain an emergency indicator;
ii) the MCData group data request shall set an alert indicator if configured
to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an MCData standalone data
request for the emergency short data service communication; and
iii) if MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state of MCData client 1 is
retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril short
data service communication:
i) the MCData group data request shall contain an imminent peril indicator.
2a. If either emergency indicator or imminent peril indicator is present in
received MCData group data request, the MCData server implicitly affiliates
MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not already affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group data request. The MCData server resolves the
MCData group ID to determine the members of that group and their affiliation
status, based on the information from the group management server. The MCData
server also checks whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types
of message or content to certain members due, for example, to location or user
privilege. MCData server also verifies whether the provided functional alias,
if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
i) if an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group data
request and if MCData group is not in in-progress emergency state, the MCData
group is considered to be in the in-progress emergency state until cancelled;
NOTE 2: While the MCData group is in the in-progress emergency state, all
types of MCData communications within the group are processed as emergency
group communications by the MCData server. MCData group members that are not
in the emergency state do not indicate emergency in group communication
requests.
ii) if an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
data request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress imminent peril,
the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress imminent peril state
until cancelled;
3a. The MCData server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for
all participants in the MCData group.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData group data request towards each MCData
user determined in Step 3. The MCData group data request towards each MCData
client contains:
i) an emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData group data
request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
data request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group data request from MCData client 1;
5\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n optionally notify the user about the
incoming MCData session data request.
6\. The receiving MCData client 2 to n accept or reject the MCData group data
request and the corresponding result is in the MCData group data response
towards MCData server.
7\. MCData server forwards the MCData group data response received from MCData
client 2 to n to the MCData user initiating the MCData session data request.
NOTE 3: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the data transmission.
8\. MCData client 1 and the MCData group data request accepted clients have
successfully established media plane for data communication and either MCData
client can transmit SDS data. The MCData data request may contain disposition
request if indicated by the client sending data. If the payload is for MCData
user consumption (e.g. is not application data, is not command instructions,
etc.) then the SDS data receiving MCData users may be notified, otherwise
those MCData users shall not be notified.
9\. If MCData data disposition was requested by the user, then the SDS data
receiving MCData client initiates a MCData data disposition notification for
delivery, read reports to the disposition requesting user. The MCData data
disposition notification from the receiving MCData clients may be stored by
the MCData server for disposition history interrogation from authorized users.
10\. Based on the MCData user action or conditions to release, the established
media plane for SDS data exchange is released.

MCData user is upgrading an ongoing MCData one-to-one SDS communication to an
MCData emergency one-to-one SDS communication. This procedure is applicable
only when MCData one-to-one SDS communication is established as described in
subclause 7.4.2.3 \"One-to-one standalone short data service using media
plane\" or as described in subclause 7.4.2.4 \"One-to-one short data service
session\".
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the MCData one-to-one SDS communication belong to the same
MCData system.
2\. MCdata one-to-one SDS communication is already in progress.
Figure 7.4.2.8.2-1 MCData one-to-one SDS communication upgraded to MCData
emergency one-to-one SDS communication
1\. The MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an emergency. MCData client 1
sets its MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client 1
is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
2\. MCData client 1 requests the MCData server to upgrade the one-to-one
MCData SDS communication to in-progress emergency by sending a MCData one-to-
one SDS communication upgrade request.
3\. The MCData server sends the MCData one-to-one SDS communication upgrade
request towards MCData client 2, the MCData client of the other participant.
NOTE 2: MCData client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCData one-to-one SDS communication upgrade request containing
the emergency indicator.
4\. The MCData user is notified of the in-progress emergency of the MCData
emergency one-to-one SDS communication.
5\. The receiving MCData client acknowledges the MCData one-to-one SDS
communication upgrade request and sends MCData one-to-one SDS communication
upgrade response to the MCData server.
6\. The MCData server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for both
participants of the MCData one-to-one SDS communication. The priority is
retained until the communication session ends.
7\. The MCData server sends MCData one-to-one SDS communication upgrade
response to MCData client 1.
8\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 continue with the MCData one-to-one
SDS communication, which has been transformed into an MCData emergency one-to-
one SDS communication.
#### 7.4.2.9 Group SDS communication upgrade to a group emergency SDS
communication
##### 7.4.2.9.1 General
This clause is for adding procedures related to upgrading an existing MCData
group SDS communication to an MCData emergency group SDS communication.
##### 7.4.2.9.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.9.2-1 describes the case where an authorized
MCData user is upgrading an ongoing MCData group SDS communication to an
MCData emergency group SDS communication. This procedure is applicable only
when group MCData communication is established as described in subclause
7.4.2.6 \"Group standalone short data service using media plane\" or as
described in subclause 7.4.2.7 \"Group short data service session\".
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCData server is shown in place of a user
home MCData server and a group hosting MCData server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 affiliated to that MCData
group.
2\. All members of the MCData group belong to the same MCData system.
3\. MCData group SDS communication is already in progress.
4\. The initiating MCData client 1 has been configured to send an MCData
emergency alert when upgrading an MCData emergency group communication.
Figure 7.4.2.9.2-1: MCData group SDS communication upgraded to MCData
emergency group SDS communication
1\. The MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCData
client 1 sets its MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData
client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client
1.
NOTE 2: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
2\. MCData client 1 requests the MCData server to upgrade the MCData group to
an in-progress emergency state by sending a MCData group SDS communication
upgrade request. The MCData client 1 sets the emergency indicator in the
request. If configured to send an MCData alert when initiating an MCData
emergency group SDS upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an
MCData alert is to be initiated.
3\. The MCData server sets the emergency state of the MCData group and adjusts
the priority of the underlying bearer for all or selected participants in the
MCData group SDS communication that receive the communication over unicast.
NOTE 3: The determination of the selected participants whose bearers have to
be upgraded is left to implementation.
NOTE 4: While the MCData group is in the in-progress emergency state, all
types of MCData communications within the group are processed as emergency
group communications by the MCData server. MCData group members that are not
in the emergency state do not indicate emergency in group communication
requests.
4\. MCData server sends the MCData group SDS communication upgrade request
towards the MCData clients of each of those affiliated MCData group members.
The request contains an indication of an MCData emergency alert if the request
from the originator indicated MCData emergency alert.
5\. MCData users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the MCData
group.
6\. The receiving MCData clients send the MCData group SDS communication
upgrade response to the MCData server to acknowledge the MCData group
emergency request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCData server sends the MCData group SDS communication upgrade
response to the MCData user 1 to confirm the upgrade request.
NOTE 5: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 continue with the MCData
group SDS communication, which has been transformed into an MCData emergency
group SDS communication.
#### 7.4.2.10 Group SDS communication in-progress emergency group state cancel
##### 7.4.2.10.1 General
This clause describes procedures related to MCData in-progress emergency group
state cancel. The emergency state of the group can also be cancelled by the
group FD in-progress emergency state cancellation procedure in subclause
7.5.2.13.2, or by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP
TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.
##### 7.4.2.10.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.4.2.10.2-1 describes the case where an authorized
MCData user cancels MCData group\'s in-progress emergency.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 affiliated to that MCData
group.
2\. All members of the MCData group belong to the same MCData system.
3\. MCData group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.
4\. The MCData group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized
bearer support.
5\. MCData client 1 previously initiated the in-progress emergency for the
group.
Figure 7.4.2.10.2-1: MCData group SDS in-progress emergency group state cancel
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData group SDS in-progress
emergency group state cancel.
NOTE 1: An MCData user authorized to cancel in-progress emergencies on the
MCData group can also be authorised to cancel the MCData emergency alert in
addition to the initiator. However, only the initiator can cancel the
initiator\'s local MCData emergency state.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends an MCData group SDS communication in-progress
priority state cancel request to the MCData server. The MCData client 1 also
resets the emergency indicator in the request to inform MCData server about
cancellation of in-progress emergency group state.
NOTE 2: If an MCData emergency alert relating to MCData client 1 is in effect
together with an MCData in-progress emergency group state on the MCData group,
the MCData emergency alert of MCData client 1 can be cancelled at the same
time. In that case, the MCData group SDS in-progress priority group state
cancel request carries an indication that the emergency alert of MCData client
1 is also being cancelled.
NOTE 3: If an MCData group SDS communication in-progress priority state cancel
request is received by the MCData server while a group member that is in the
emergency state is transmitting, the MCData group SDS communication in-
progress priority state cancel request is rejected by the MCData server.
3\. The MCData server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCData server cancels/resets the
emergency in-progress state of the MCData group.
4\. The MCData server sends an MCData group SDS in-progress priority state
cancel request to the MCData group members.
5\. MCData group members are notified of the MCData group SDS in-progress
emergency state cancel.
6\. The receiving MCData clients send the MCData group SDS in-progress
priority state cancel response to the MCData server to acknowledge the MCData
in-progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCData server sends the MCData group SDS in-progress priority state
cancel response to the MCData user 1 to confirm the MCData in-progress
emergency group state cancel. If the MCData in-progress emergency group state
cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCData
client 1 resets its local emergency status.
NOTE 4: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
#### 7.4.2.11 Group SDS communication upgrade to an imminent peril group SDS
communication
##### 7.4.2.11.1 General
This clause is for adding procedures related to upgrade to an imminent peril
group SDS communication.
##### 7.4.2.11.2 Procedure
This procedure is applicable only when group MCData SDS communication is
established as described in subclause 7.4.2.6 \"Group standalone short data
service using media plane\" or as described in subclause 7.4.2.7 \"Group short
data service session\". The MCData service shall support the procedures and
related information flows as specified in subclause 7.4.2.9 \"Group SDS
communication upgrade to a group SDS emergency communication\" with the
following clarifications:
\- In step 2), the MCData client 1 sets the imminent peril indicator;
\- In step 3), the bearers\' priority is adjusted as necessary, to correspond
to an imminent peril priority which could be different than the setting used
in the procedure in subclause 7.4.2.9; and
\- In step 5), MCData users are notified of the in-progress imminent peril
state of the MCData group.
#### 7.4.2.12 Group SDS communication in-progress imminent peril group state
cancel
##### 7.4.2.12.1 General
This clause is for adding procedures related to group SDS communication in-
progress imminent peril group state cancel.
##### 7.4.2.12.2 Procedure
The MCData service shall support the procedures and related information flows
as specified in subclause 7.4.2.10 \"Group SDS communication in-progress
emergency group state cancel\" with the following clarifications:
\- In step 2), the MCData client 1 sets imminent peril indicator; and
\- In step 5), MCData users are notified of the group SDS communication in-
progress imminent peril state cancel.
#### 7.4.2.13 Providing data for a user entering an ongoing MCData group
conversation
##### 7.4.2.13.1 General
The MCData service shall support mechanisms that allow a MCData user be
presented with the whole content of a group conversation in a group that he is
a member of. This includes the content (messages) exchanged before the MCData
user joins the group conversation.
##### 7.4.2.13.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.2.13.2-1 describes procedures for a MCData user joining late a
group conversation.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData group is provisioned for lossless communication.
2\. All members of the MCData group have an account created in the MCData
message store.
3\. MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 are members of the
same MCData group,

and affiliated to the MCData group.
5\. MCData client 3 is served by MCData server 2 and has not affiliated to the
MCData group yet.
> NOTE 1: The interactions of MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 to MCData
> message store are not shown in the figure.
Figure 7.4.2.13.2-1: Providing data for a user entering an ongoing MCData
group conversation
1\. A group conversation is initiated according to procedures in subclause
7.4.2.6, and all members of the group are invited into the communication
whether affiliated or not. As MCData user 3 is not affiliated at this time,
MCData server 2 accepts the invitation to the group conversation on behalf of
MCData user 3.
2\. The media plane is established for the group conversation. MCData server 2
is in the media plane to receive the conversation on behalf of MCData user 3.
3\. MCData server 2 stores the received conversation to MCData user 3 account
in the MCData message store.
NOTE 2: If the received conversation requests delivery notification the MCData
server 2 will send message delivered to the message sender. If the received
conversation requests read notification the MCData client 3 will send message
read to the message sender once it has presented the message to the user.
4\. MCData user 3 is online and using MCData client 3 to affiliate to the
MCData group.
5\. MCData client 3, through the message store client, synchronizes with the
MCData user 3 account in the MCData message store.
6\. MCData server 2 invites MCData client 3 to the MCData group conversation.
7\. MCData user 3 joins the MCData group conversation.

#### 7.4.3.3 One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.3.3.1 General
This subclause describes the detailed procedures for the scenario where SDS
data is to be sent to MCData user in off-network.
##### 7.4.3.3.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.3.3.2-1 describes procedures for an off-network MCData client 1
initiating one-to-one MCData data communication for sending standalone SDS
data to other MCData client, with or without disposition request. Standalone
refers to sending unidirectional data in one transaction. The SDS data size is
assumed to be pre-configured.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user 1 has initiated communication for sending standalone SDS data
to other MCData user 2.
2\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are members of the same ProSe
Discovery group and are ProSe 1:1 direct communication capable.
3\. MCData client 1 has discovered MCData client 2 in proximity, associated
with MCData user B, using ProSe Discovery procedures.
Figure 7.4.3.3.2-1: One-to-one standalone short data service using signalling
control plane
1\. MCData client 1 checks whether the MCData user 1 is authorized to send
MCData standalone data request.
2\. If MCData user 1 is authorised MCData client 1 sends a MCData standalone
data request towards the MCData client 2. The MCData standalone data request
contains conversation identifier for message thread indication. The MCData
standalone data request may include additional implementation specific
information in the application metadata container. The MCData standalone data
request may contain disposition request if indicated by the user at MCData
client 1. If MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
communication, then emergency indicator is included in the MCData standalone
data request. If an MCData emergency state is not set already when MCData
emergency communication is initiated, the MCData client 1 sets its MCData
emergency state and is retained until explicitly cancelled. The value of ProSe
Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to the state of the MCData
communication.
3\. On receiving a MCData standalone data request, the MCData client 2 checks
whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or
content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege.
4\. If the policy assertion is positive and the payload is for MCData user
consumption (e.g. is not application data, is not command instructions, etc.)
then the MCData user of MCData client 2 may be notified. Otherwise if the
payload is not for MCData user consumption, then the MCData user of MCData
client 2 shall not be notified. The action taken when the payload contains
application data or command instructions are specific based on the contents of
the payload. Payload content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to
a known local non-MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the
MCData client 2 to start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start
application) and shall pass the payload content to the just started
application.
NOTE: If the policy assertion was negative, the MCData client 2 sends an
appropriate notification to MCData client 1.
5\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report.
6\. If the MCData data disposition for read was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then once the receiving user reads the data, the receiving
MCData client 2 initiates a MCData data disposition notification for read
report.
#### 7.4.3.4 Group standalone short data service using signalling control
plane
##### 7.4.3.4.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone SDS to a selected group results in off-
network MCData group members receiving the SDS data.
##### 7.4.3.4.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.3.4.2-1 describes procedures for an off-network MCData client 1
initiating group MCData data communication for sending SDS data to a MCData
group, with or without disposition request. The SDS data size limit is pre-
configured.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user 1 has initiated group communication for sending SDS data to
the MCData group.
2\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCData
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCData
client 1.
3\. MCData client 1 to MCData client N are members of the same MCData group.
Figure 7.4.3.4.2-1: Group standalone short data service using signalling
control plane
1\. MCData client 1 checks whether the MCData user 1 is authorized to send
MCData group standalone data request.
2\. If MCData user 1 is authorised MCData client 1 sends a MCData group
standalone data request towards the MCData group. The MCData group standalone
data request contains conversation identifier for message thread indication.
The MCData group standalone data request may include additional implementation
specific information in the application metadata container. The MCData group
standalone data request may contain disposition request if indicated by the
user at MCData client 1. If MCData group standalone data request contains
disposition request, MCData group standalone data request shall also contain
the IP address of the MCData client 1. If MCData user at the MCData client 1
initiates an MCData emergency communication, then the emergency indicator or
the imminent peril indicator is included in the MCData standalone data
request. If an MCData emergency state is not set already when MCData emergency
communication is initiated, the MCData client 1 sets its MCData emergency
state and is retained until explicitly cancelled. The value of ProSe Per
Packet Priority is upgraded according to the state of the MCData
communication.
3\. On receiving a MCData group standalone data request, the MCData clients
check whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message
or content to certain members due, for example, to location or user privilege.
4\. If the policy assertion is positive and the payload is for MCData user
consumption (e.g. is not application data, is not command instructions, etc.)
then the MCData user may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for
MCData user consumption, then the MCData user shall not be notified. The
action taken when the payload contains application data or command
instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload. Payload

#### 7.4.3.6 Group standalone short data service with MCData message store
##### 7.4.3.6.1 General
A MCData user\'s off-network communication needs to be part of his
communication history when the MCData user has an account in the MCData
message store.
##### 7.4.3.6.2 Procedure
Figure 7.4.3.6.2-1 describes procedures of a MCData user, MCData user 2, that
has an account in MCData message store and how his off-network SDS group
communication is stored in his account in the MCData message store. All other
MCData clients in the figure follow the procedures described in subclause
7.4.3.4.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user 1 to N are in an off-network group communication.
2\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCData
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured to MCData
client 1 to N.
3\. MCData client 1 to N are members of the same MCData group.
4\. MCData user 2 has an account in the MCData message store.
Figure 7.4.3.6.2-1: Group standalone short data service with MCData message
store
1\. MCData client 1 to MCData client N are in an off-network group
communication according to the procedures in subclause 7.4.3.4, SDS are
exchanged among all MCData clients.
2\. If the SDS is for MCData user consumption, the SDS is stored in the local
message store on the MCData UE of MCData user 2.
NOTE: A pre-configured folder for off-network communication objects can be
provisioned both on the UE and the user account on the MCData message store to
be used for synchronization.
3\. The off-network group communication comes to an end.
4\. The MCData user 2 connects back to the network.
5\. The MCData user 2 decides to keep the off-network communication in his
account on the MCData message store. The message store client 2 uploads the
off-network communication objects from the local message store to the MCData
message store.

#### 7.5.2.2 File upload using HTTP
##### 7.5.2.2.1 General
The media storage client uses HTTP for a standalone data file upload towards
the MCData content server.
##### 7.5.2.2.2 Procedure for uploading the file residing in the local storage
of the MCData UE without QoS
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.2.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
uploading a file to media storage function on the MCData content server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user on the media storage client is registered for receiving
MCData service.
2\. The MCData content server has the ability to verify if the requesting
MCData user is authorised to upload.
Figure 7.5.2.2.2-1: Uploading of the file residing in MCData UE using HTTP
1\. The user at the media storage client initiates a file upload request of
the chosen file. If MCData emergency state is already set for the media
storage client (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert), the media
storage client sets emergency indicator in the request. The media storage
client verifies that the size of the file is within the maximum data size for
FD for the intended MCData FD request (by checking the group configuration for
a group FD request and by checking the service configuration for a one-to-one
FD request).
2\. The file to be uploaded is received by the media storage client and sent
to the media storage function on the MCData content server for storing using
the MCData upload data request.
3\. The MCData content server stores the file and provides a MCData upload
data response indicating success (along with file URL to the media storage
client) or failure.
##### 7.5.2.2.3 Procedure for uploading the file residing in the MCData
message store
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.2.3-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
uploading a file to media storage function on the MCData content server from
his or her MCData message store account.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The Media storage client knows the URL of the file residing in the MCData
message store account of the user.
Figure 7.5.2.2.3-1: Uploading of the file residing in MCData message store
using HTTP
1\. The user at the media storage client initiates a file upload request of
the file residing in his MCData message store account.
2\. The URL of the file which needs to be retrieved from the MCData message
store account of the user is sent to the media storage function on the MCData
content server using the MCData upload data request.
3\. The MCData content server fetches the file from the MCData message store
account of the user using the URL provided in the MCData upload data request.
4\. The MCData content server stores the retrieved file content into its
repository.
5\. The MCData content provides a MCData upload data response indicating
success (along with file URL to the media storage client) or failure.
##### 7.5.2.2.4 Procedure for file upload including request of network
resources with required QoS
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.2.4-1 describes the case where an MCData client
sends a request to the MCData server for the upload of a file from the media
storage client on the MCData client to the media storage function on the
MCData content server. The MCData server can, therefore, request network
resources with the required QoS for the corresponding file upload.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user on the MCData client is registered on the MCData server
for receiving MCData service.
2\. The MCData client is required to upload a file to the MCData content
server over network resources with required QoS.
3\. The MCData client knows its IP address/port to be used for the file upload
as well as the URI or IP address/port of the target MCData content server.
NOTE: How the MCData client knows the IP addresses and ports to be used for
the file upload is implementation specific and out of the scope of this
specification.
Figure 7.5.2.2.4-1: File upload using HTTP over network resources with
required QoS
1\. The MC user on the MCData client intends to upload a file to the MCData
content server for file distribution. The MCData client verifies that the size
of the file is within the maximum data size for FD for the intended MCData FD
request (e.g., by checking the group configuration for a group FD request or
the service configuration for a one-to-one FD request). If the MCData
emergency state is already set for the MCData client, the MCData client sets
the emergency indicator in the request.
2\. The MCData client sends the MCData file upload request to the MCData
server. This request contains information about the MCData client (including
IP address and port to be used for the file upload), and the target MCData
content server (including associated URI or IP address, and port).
3\. The MCData server verifies that the corresponding MCData client is
authorized to upload files to the corresponding MCData content server.
4\. If the MCData client is authorized for the file upload, the MCData server
sends a request to the 3GPP system for the allocation of network resources
with the required QoS for the corresponding file upload communication between
the MCData client and the MCData content server. For that, the MCData server
performs policy and charging control (PCC) procedures, e.g., over the Rx
reference point as described in 3GPP TS 23.203 [14] for the case of an EPS
system.
5\. The MCData server sends a MCData file upload response to the MCData client
indicating if it can proceed with the file upload to the MCData content
server.
6\. The media storage client on the MCData client sends an MCData upload data
request to the media storage function on the MCData content server to upload
the file.
7\. The MCData content server provides an MCData upload data response to the
MCData client indicating if the file was successfully stored (along with file
URL) or failure.
8\. The MCData client provides to the MCData server an MCData file upload
completion status indicating that the file upload is completed.
9\. Based on the MCData file upload completion status, the MCData server
requests to the 3GPP system to release the network resources allocated for the
corresponding file upload.
#### 7.5.2.3 File download using HTTP
##### 7.5.2.3.1 General
The media storage client uses HTTP for a standalone data file download from
the MCData content server.
##### 7.5.2.3.2 Procedure for file download from the MCData content server
without QoS
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.3.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
downloading a file from the media storage function of the MCData content
server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user on the media storage client is registered for receiving
MCData service.
Figure 7.5.2.3.2-1: File download using HTTP
1\. The user at the media storage client initiates a file download request
available at the indicated URL.
2\. The file available at the URL (received in MCData FD request or MCData
group standalone FD request) is requested to be downloaded by the media
storage client from the media storage function on the MCData content server
using a MCData download data request. If emergency indicator is set in
received in MCData FD request or MCData group standalone FD request, the media
storage client sets emergency indicator in MCData download data request.
NOTE: The media storage client can perform partial download requests to
complete the missing parts after an incomplete file transfer.
3\. The media storage function on the MCData content server may apply
reception control policy and provides a MCData download data response
including the file to the media storage client.
##### 7.5.2.3.3 Procedure for file download including request of network
resources with required QoS
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.3.3-1 describes the case where an MCData client
sends a request to the MCData server for the download of a file from the media
storage client on the MCData client to the media storage function on the
MCData content server. The MCData server can, therefore, request network
resources with the required QoS for the corresponding file download.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user on the MCData client is registered on the MCData server
for receiving MCData service.
2\. The MCData client has been requested to download a file using HTTP and has
received the corresponding file URL (via an MCData FD request or MCData group
standalone FD request).
3\. The MCData client is required to download a file from the MCData content
server over network resources with required QoS.
NOTE 1: It is implementation specific whether an MCData system enables that
network resources with required QoS are required for file downloads.
4\. The MCData client knows its IP address/port to be used for the file
download as well as the URI or IP address/port of the target MCData content
server.
NOTE 2: How the MCData client knows the IP addresses and ports to be used for
the file download is implementation specific and out of the scope of this
specification.
Figure 7.5.2.3.3-1: File download using HTTP over network resources with
required QoS
1\. The MC user on the MCData client intends to download a file from the
MCData content server based on a received MCData FD request or MCData group
standalone FD request. If the MCData emergency state is already set for the
MCData client, the MCData client sets the emergency indicator in the request.
2\. The MCData client sends the MCData file download request to the MCData
server. This request contains information about the MCData client (including
IP address and port to be used for the file download), and the target MCData
content server (including associated URI or IP address, and port). The request
also contains the corresponding file URL on the MCData content server.
3\. The MCData server may verify, based on the received file URL, whether the
file is available in the MCData content server via the MCData-FD-5 reference
point. For that, the MCData server sends an MCData file availability request
to the MCData content server. Upon the receipt of the request, the MCData
content server provides an MCData file availability response to the MCData
server. If the MCData server identifies that the corresponding file is not
available in the MCData content server, the MCData server provides a response
to the MCData client indicating that the file download request cannot proceed
due to the unavailability of the file in the MCData content server.
4\. The MCData server verifies that the corresponding MCData client is
authorized to download the file from the corresponding MCData content server.
5\. If the MCData client is authorized for the file download, the MCData
server sends a request to the 3GPP system for the allocation of network
resources with the required QoS for the corresponding file download
communication between the MCData client and the MCData content server. For
that, the MCData server performs policy and charging control (PCC) procedures,
e.g., over the Rx reference point as described in 3GPP TS 23.203 [14] for the
case of an EPS system.
6\. The MCData server sends a MCData file download response to the MCData
client indicating whether it can proceed with the file download from the
MCData content server.
7\. The media storage client on the MCData client sends an MCData download
data request to the media storage function on the MCData content server to
download the corresponding file.
8\. The MCData content server provides an MCData download data response to the
MCData client including the file for the case of a successful response.
9\. The MCData client provides to the MCData server an MCData download
completed report indicating that the file download is completed.
10\. Based on the MCData download completed report, the MCData server requests
to the 3GPP system to release the network resources allocated for the
corresponding file download.
#### 7.5.2.4 One-to-one file distribution using HTTP
##### 7.5.2.4.1 General
The MCData client uses HTTP file distribution to download a file that is
uploaded by another MCData client. The procedure is appropriate for both
mandatory and non-mandatory download cases. The target MCData user may be
addressed using the functional alias that can be shared with other MCData
users.
##### 7.5.2.4.2 Procedure for single MCData system
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.4.2-1 describes the case where a MCData user is
initiating one-to-one data communication for sending file to the other MCData
user, with or without download completed report request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 and the MCData client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCData service.
2\. The file to be distributed is uploaded to media storage function on MCData
content server using the procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
3\. The MCData client may have activated functional alias to be used.
4\. The MCData server has subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.5.2.4.2-1: One-to-one file distribution using HTTP
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
the chosen MCData user.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends a MCData FD request towards the MCData server.
The MCData FD request contains content payload in the form of file URL and may
contain the file metadata information. The MCData FD request contains one
MCData user for one-to-one data communication as selected by the user at
MCData client 1. The MCData FD request contains conversation identifier for
message thread indication. The MCData FD request may include additional
implementation specific information in the application metadata container. If
MCData user at MCData client 1 has requested to mandatory download at the
recipient side, then MCData FD request contains mandatory download indication.
If the MCData user at MCData client has requested to deposit the file content
into his/her MCData message store account, then MCData FD request contains
deposit file indication set. The MCData FD request may contain download
completed report indication if selected by the user at MCData client 1. The
MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within the FD
data transfer and may address the target MCData client 2 using a functional
alias.
a) If the MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
file distribution using HTTP or MCData emergency state is already set for the
MCData client 1 (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData FD request shall contain emergency indicator; and
ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client 1 is
retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData FD request and that the size of the file is below
maximum data size for FD from the service configuration. MCData server
verifies whether the provided functional alias of MCData client 1, if present,
can be used and has been activated for the user. If functional alias is used
to address that target MCData user, the MCData server resolves the functional
alias to the corresponding MCData IDs for which the functional alias is active
and proceed with step 4 otherwise proceed with step 6.
NOTE 2: If the MCData server detects that the functional alias used as the
target of the MCData FD request is simultaneously active for multiple MCData
users, then the MCData server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCData
ID based on some selection criteria. The selection of an appropriate MCData ID
is left to implementation. These selection criteria can include rejection of
the MCData FD request, if no suitable MCData ID is selected.
4\. The MCData server may verify whether the corresponding file is available
in the MCData content server (not shown in the figure) via the MCData-FD-5
reference point using the received file URL in the MCData FD request. For
that, the MCData server sends an MCData file availability request to the
MCData content server. Upon the receipt of the request, the MCData content
server provides an MCData file availability response to the MCData server. If
the MCData server identifies that the corresponding file is not available in
the MCData content server, the MCData server provides a response to the MCData
client 1 indicating that the file distribution request cannot proceed due to
the unavailability of the file in the MCData content server.
5\. The MCData server responds back to MCData client 1 with a functional alias
resolution response message that contains the resolved MCData ID.
6\. If the MCData server replies with a MCData functional alias resolution
response message, the MCData client 1 assumes the MCData FD request in step 2
is rejected and sends a new MCData FD request towards the resolved MCData ID.
7\. MCData server initiates the MCData FD request towards MCData client 2\.
The MCData FD request towards the MCData user contains an emergency indicator
if it is present in the received MCData FD request from MCData client 1. If
the deposit file indication information element is set to true in the received
MCData FD request, MCData server shall follow the procedure as defined in the
subclause 7.13.3.8 with the retrieve file indication element set to true while
depositing this MCData communication to the MCData message store account of
the user at MCData client 1.
NOTE 3: MCData client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCData FD request containing the emergency indicator.
8\. The receiving MCData client 2 notifies the user about the incoming MCData
FD request (including file metadata, if present) which may be either accepted
or rejected or ignored.
9\. The MCData user 2 may provide a response (accept or reject) or not
(ignore) to the notification, then MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD
response to the MCData server. The MCData client 2 automatically sends an
accepted MCData FD response when the received request includes a mandatory
download indication.
10\. The MCData server forwards the MCData FD response to the MCData client 1.
11\. The Media storage client on the MCData client 2 downloads the file from
the MCData content server using the procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.3,
either automatically (for mandatory download) or based upon the MCData user 2
subsequent action. The MCData client 2 records file download completed and
notifies the MCData user 2.
12\. The MCData client 2 provides an MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed, if requested by the user at MCData client
1.
13\. The received MCData file download completed report from the MCData client
2 may be stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from
authorized MCData users. The MCData download completed report is sent by the
MCData server to the MCData user at MCData client 1, if requested by the
MCData client 1.
##### 7.5.2.4.3 Procedure with interconnection between MCData systems
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.4.3-1 describes the case where a MCData user
initiates a one-to-one data communication for sending a file to another MCData
user where that other MCData user is receiving MCData service on a partner
MCData system, and where interconnection is in use between the two MCData
systems. In this procedure, the file has not previously been downloaded in the
partner MC system.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 and the MCData client 2 are
already service authorized and receiving MCData service. MCData client 1 is
receiving service on its primary MCData system, and MCData client 2 is
receiving MCData service in the partner MCData system of MCData client 1.
2\. The file to be distributed has been uploaded to the media storage function
on the MCData content server in the primary MCData system of MCData client 1
using the procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
3\. There is a service agreement between the primary and partner MCData
systems to allow files to be shared between MCData content servers in the two
systems.
4\. The MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be used.
5\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.5.2.4.3-1: One-to-one file distribution using HTTP with
interconnection
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
the MCData user at MCData client 2.
2\. MCData client 1 sends an MCData FD request towards the primary MCData
server. The MCData FD request contains content payload in the form of a file
URL with the necessary access authorization information and may contain the
file metadata information. The MCData FD request indicates the target MCData
user for the one-to-one data communication. The MCData FD request contains a
conversation identifier for message thread indication. If the MCData user at
MCData client 1 has requested to mandatory download at the recipient side,
then the MCData FD request contains the mandatory download indication. The
MCData FD request may contain a request for a download completed report
indication if selected by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData user at
MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within the FD data transfer and
may address the target MCData client 2 using a functional alias.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send the MCData FD request and that the size of the file is
below maximum data size for FD from the service configuration. MCData server
verifies whether the provided functional alias of MCData client 1, if present,
can be used and has been activated for the user.
4\. The MCData server may verify whether the corresponding file is available
in the MCData content server via the MCData-FD-5 reference point using the
received file URL in the MCData FD request. For that, the MCData server sends
an MCData file availability request to the MCData content server. Upon the
receipt of the request, the MCData content server provides an MCData file
availability response to the MCData server. If the MCData server identifies
that the corresponding file is not available in the MCData content server, the
MCData server provides a response to the MCData client 1 indicating that the
file distribution request cannot proceed due to the unavailability of the file
in the MCData content server.
5\. The MCData server in the primary MCData system initiates the MCData FD
request towards the MCData server in the partner MCData system, which contains
the URL of the file which is stored in the primary MCData content server. The
request includes the necessary access authorization information as MCData
client 2 will retrieve the file while receiving service in the partner MCData
system.
NOTE 1: The contents of and mechanisms to use the authorization information
are outside the scope of the present document.
NOTE 2: With the use of the functional alias for addressing the target MCData
clients, the partner MCData system is to be determined by the primary MCData
system.
6\. If functional alias is used to address that target MCData user, the MCData
server in the partner MCData system resolves the MCData IDs of the functional
alias. The resulting list contains all associated MCData IDs/MCData users that
may share this functional alias. The MCData server in the partner MCData
system now checks which MCData users have FD capabilities and which are
authorized to receive a file. The partner MCData server sends the MCData FD
request to the MCData users determined. The file URL being provided in MCData
FD request to the MCData users determined is prepended with server URI of the
partner MCData content server, such that the URL identifies a file location in
the partner MCData content server.
NOTE 3: Determination of the target MCData client is based on the associated
MCData IDs that share a functional alias and other criteria.
7\. The receiving MCData client 2 may notify the user about the incoming
MCData FD request (including file metadata, if present) which may be either
accepted, rejected or ignored.
8\. The MCData user 2 may provide a response (accept or reject) or not
(ignore) to the notification, then the MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD
response to the partner MCData server. The MCData client 2 automatically sends
an accepted MCData FD response when the received request includes a mandatory
download indication.
9\. The partner MCData server forwards the MCData FD response to the MCData
server in the primary MCData system.
10\. The primary MCData server forwards the MCData FD response to MCData
client 1.
11\. MCData client 2 requests the file from the partner MCData content server.
NOTE 4: Step 11 may occur any time after step 8, before or after steps 9 and
10.
12\. The partner MCData content server checks whether the file is stored
locally, and if this is not the case, sends an MCData file retrieve request to
the primary MCData content server. The MCData file retrieve request contains
the URL of the file location in the primary MCData system, generated by
removing the prepended local path from the requested URL.
NOTE 5: The means of proving authorization for the request is outside the
scope of the present document.
13\. The primary MCData content server responds to the partner MCData content
server with an MCData file retrieve response which contains the content of the
file to be retrieved. File metadata may include the lifetime of the file. The
primary MCData content server records that the file has been sent to the
indicated partner MCData system.
NOTE 6: The partner MCData content server may store the local copy of the file
in case future requests arise until the expiry time sent from primary MCData
system for the file is reached or until a request is received to delete the
file.
14\. The partner MCData content server sends the file to MCData client 2 in
the MCData download data response. MCData client 2 records file download
completed and notifies MCData user 2.
15\. The MCData client 2 provides an MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed, if this was requested by the user at MCData
client 1 in the initial MCData FD request.
16\. The MCData download completed report is sent to the primary MCData
server. The partner MCData server may store the download completed report for
download history interrogation from authorized MCData users in the partner
MCData system.
17\. The received MCData download completed report is sent by the primary
MCData server to the MCData user at MCData client 1, if requested by the
MCData client 1. The MCData file download completed report from the MCData
client 2 may be stored by the primary MCData server for download history
interrogation from authorized MCData users in the primary MCData system.
#### 7.5.2.5 One-to-one file distribution using media plane
##### 7.5.2.5.1 General
The MCData client uses the media plane for a standalone data file download
from another MCData client. The procedure is appropriate for both mandatory
and non-mandatory download cases. The target MCData user may be addressed
using the functional alias that can be shared with other MCData users.
##### 7.5.2.5.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.5.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating one-to-one data communication for sending file to the other MCData
user, with or without download completed report request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 and the MCData client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCData service.
2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server has subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.5.2.5.2-1: One-to-one file distribution using media plane
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
the chosen MCData user.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData FD request towards the MCData server. File
metadata information is included in the SDP. The MCData FD request contains
one MCData user for one-to-one data communication as selected by the user at
MCData client 1. The MCData FD request contains conversation identifier for
message thread indication. The MCData FD request may include additional
implementation specific information in the application metadata container.
MCData FD request may contain mandatory download indication. The MCData FD
request may contain download completed report indication if selected by the
user at MCData client 1. MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a
functional alias within the FD data transfer and may address the target MCData
client 2 using a functional alias.
a) If the MCData user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency
file distribution communication or MCData emergency state is already set for
the MCData client 1 (due to previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) The MCData FD request shall contain emergency indicator; and
ii) If MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client 1 is
retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData FD request. MCData server verifies whether the
provided functional alias of MCData client 1, if present, can be used and has
been activated for the user. If functional alias is used to address that
target MCData user, the MCData server resolves the functional alias to the
corresponding MCData ID(s) for which the functional alias is active and
proceed with step 4 otherwise proceed with step 6.
NOTE 2: If the MCData server detects that the functional alias used as the
target of the MCData FD request is simultaneously active for multiple MCData
users, then the MCData server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCData
ID based on some selection criteria. The selection of an appropriate MCData ID
is left to implementation. These selection criteria can include rejection of
the MCData FD request, if no suitable MCData ID is selected.
4\. The MCData server responds back to MCData client 1 with a functional alias
resolution response message that contains the resolved MCData ID.
5\. If the MCData server replies with a MCData functional alias resolution
response message, the MCData client 1 assumes the MCData FD request in step 2
is rejected and sends a new MCData FD request towards the resolved MCData ID.
6\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control and the
necessary policy to ensure that appropriate data is transmitted between the
MCData UEs.
7\. MCData server initiates the MCData FD request towards the MCData users
determined. The MCData FD request towards the MCData user contains the
emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData FD request from
MCData client 1.
NOTE 3: MCData client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCData FD request containing the emergency indicator.
8\. The receiving MCData client 2 notifies the user about the incoming MCData
FD request which may be either accepted or rejected or ignored. If the request
includes mandatory download indication in the MCData FD request an accepted
response is assumed.
9\. If the target MCData user 2 provides a response (accept or reject) to the
notification, then MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD response to the MCData
server. MCData client 2 automatically sends accepted MCData FD response when
the incoming request included mandatory download indication.
10\. MCData server forwards the MCData FD response from MCData client 2 back
to MCData client 1.
11\. MCData client 1 distributes the file over the established media plane to
MCData server.
12\. MCData server distributes the file received from MCData client 1 to
MCData client 2 over the established media plane. File download report is
shared by the MCData client 2, if requested by the user at MCData client 1.
After file transaction is completed, the media plane is released. The MCData
client 2 records file download completed and notifies MCData user 2.
NOTE 4: MCData server is not required to wait for the complete download of
file from MCData client 1 prior to initiating file distribution to MCData
client 2.
13\. MCData client 2 initiates a MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed, if requested by the user at MCData client
1.
14\. The MCData file download completed report from MCData client may be
stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from the
authorized MCData users. MCData download completed report is sent by the
MCData server to the user at MCData client 1.
#### 7.5.2.6 Group standalone file distribution using HTTP
##### 7.5.2.6.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone FD using HTTP to a selected group,
results in affiliated group members receiving the file data.
##### 7.5.2.6.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.6.2-1 describes the case where a MCData user is
initiating group standalone data communication for sending a file to multiple
MCData users, with or without download completed report request from the
MCData user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData clients 1 to n belong to the same MCData
group and are already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated
to the group.
2\. The file to be distributed is uploaded to the media storage function on
the MCData content server using the procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
3\. The MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be used.
> 4\. The MCData server has subscribed to the MCData functional alias
> controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
> activation updates.
Figure 7.5.2.6.2-1: Group standalone FD using HTTP
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by MCData
group ID) and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends a MCData group standalone FD request towards the
MCData server. The MCData FD request contains content payload in the form of
file URL and may contain the file metadata information. The MCData group
standalone data request contains either the selected MCData group ID or the
target recipients as selected by the user at MCData client 1. The MCData group
standalone FD request contains conversation identifier for message thread
indication. The MCData group standalone FD request may include additional
implementation specific information in the application metadata container. If
MCData user at MCData client 1 has requested to mandatory download at the
recipient side, then MCData group standalone FD request contains mandatory
download indication. The MCData group standalone FD request may contain a
download completed report indication if selected by the user at MCData client
1. The MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias within
the FD data transfer. If the MCData user at MCData client has requested to
deposit the file content into his/her MCData message store account, then
MCData FD request contains deposit file indication set.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency FD
communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for the MCData
client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group standalone FD request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii) the MCData group standalone FD request shall set an alert indicator if
configured to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an MCData group
standalone FD request for the emergency FD communication; and
iii) if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets
its MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client 1 is
retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril FD
communication:
i) the MCData group standalone FD request shall contain an imminent peril
indicator.
2a. If either emergency indicator or imminent peril indicator is present in
the received MCData group standalone FD request, the MCData server implicitly
affiliates MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not already
affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send an MCData group standalone FD request and that the size of
the file is below maximum data size for FD from the group configuration.
MCData server verifies whether the provided functional alias, if present, can
be used and has been activated for the user. If the MCData group ID is used,
the MCData server resolves the MCData group ID to determine the members of
that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from the
group management server.
i) If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
emergency state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
emergency state until cancelled; and
NOTE 2: While the MCData group is in the in-progress emergency state, all
types of MCData communications within the group are processed as emergency
group communications by the MCData server. MCData group members that are not
in the emergency state do not indicate emergency in group communication
requests.
ii) If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
imminent peril state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until cancelled.
4\. The MCData server may verify whether the corresponding file is available
in the MCData content server (not shown in the figure) via the MCData-FD-5
reference point using the received file URL in the MCData group standalone FD
request. For that, the MCData server sends an MCData file availability request
to the MCData content server. Upon the receipt of the request, the MCData
content server provides an MCData file availability response to the MCData
server. If the MCData server identifies that the file is not available in the
MCData content server, the MCData server provides a response to the MCData
client 1 indicating that the file distribution request cannot proceed due to
the unavailability of the file in the MCData content server and skip rest of
the steps. If the deposit file indication information element is set to true
in the received MCData FD request, MCData server shall follow the procedure as
defined in the subclause 7.13.3.8 with the retrieve file indication element
set to true while depositing this MCData communication to the MCData message
store account of the user at MCData client 1.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone FD request towards
each MCData user determined in step 3. The MCData group standalone FD request
towards each MCData client contains:
i) an emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group standalone FD request from the MCData client 1.
6\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n notify the user about the incoming
MCData group standalone FD request (including file metadata, if present) which
may be either accepted or rejected or ignored.
7\. If the target MCData user on MCData clients 2 to n provides a response
(accept or reject) to the notification, then respective MCData client sends
the MCData group standalone FD response to the MCData server. MCData client 2
to n automatically sends accepted MCData group standalone FD response when the
incoming request included mandatory download indication.
8\. The MCData server forwards the MCData group standalone FD responses to the
MCData client 1.
NOTE 3: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 9
depending on the conditions to proceed with the file transmission.
9\. The media storage client on the MCData client(s) accepting the request
downloads the file from the MCData content server (not shown in the figure)
using the procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.3, either automatically (for
mandatory download) or based upon the MCData user subsequent action. The
MCData clients successfully receiving the file through the media storage
clients, record file download completed and notify the MCData users.
10\. The MCData clients, receiving the file through the media storage client,
provide MCData download completed reports for reporting file download
completed, if requested by the user at MCData client 1.
11\. The MCData file download completed reports from MCData clients may be
stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from the
authorized MCData users. The MCData file download completed report from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
12\. Aggregated or individual MCData download completed reports are sent by
the MCData server to the MCData user at MCData client 1, if requested by the
MCData client 1.
#### 7.5.2.7 Group standalone file distribution using media plane
##### 7.5.2.7.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone FD using media plane to a selected group,
results in affiliated group members receiving the file data.
##### 7.5.2.7.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.7.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user is
initiating group standalone data communication for sending file to multiple
MCData users, with or without download completed report request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 to n belong to the same group and
are already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
> 2\. Optionally, the MCData client may have an activated functional alias to
> be used.
3\. The MCData server has subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.5.2.7.2-1: Group standalone FD using media plane
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates a file distribution request to
multiple MCData users selecting a pre-configured group (identified by MCData
group ID) and optionally particular members from that group.
2\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData group standalone FD request towards the
MCData server. File metadata information is included in the SDP. The MCData
group standalone data request contains target recipient(s) as selected by the
user at MCData client 1. The MCData group standalone FD request contains
conversation identifier for message thread indication. The MCData group
standalone FD request may include additional implementation specific
information in the application metadata container. MCData group standalone FD
request may contain mandatory download indication. The MCData group standalone
FD request may contain download completed report indication if selected by the
user at MCData client 1. MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a
functional alias within the FD data transfer.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency file
distribution communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for
the MCData client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i) the MCData group standalone FD request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii) the MCData group standalone FD request shall set an alert indicator if
configured to send an MCData emergency alert while initiating an MCData group
standalone FD request for the emergency file distribution service
communication; and
iii) if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets
its MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData imminent peril file
distribution communication:
i) the MCData group standalone FD request shall contain an imminent peril
indicator.
2a. If either emergency indicator or imminent peril indicator is present in
the received MCData group standalone data request, the MCData server
implicitly affiliates MCData client 1 to the MCData group if the client is not
already affiliated.
3\. MCData server checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to send MCData group standalone FD request. MCData server verifies
whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been
activated for the user. The MCData server resolves the MCData group ID to
determine the members of that group and their affiliation status, based on the
information from the group management server.
i) If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
emergency state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
emergency state until cancelled; and
NOTE 2: While the MCData group is in the in-progress emergency state, all
types of MCData communications within the group are processed as emergency
group communications by the MCData server. MCData group members that are not
in the emergency state do not indicate emergency in group communication
requests.
ii) If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request and if the MCData group is not in the in-progress
imminent peril state, the MCData group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until cancelled.
4\. The MCData server also applies transmission and reception control and the
necessary policy to ensure that appropriate data is transmitted between the
MCData UEs.
5\. MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone FD request towards
each MCData user determined in step 3. The MCData group standalone data
request towards each MCData client contains:
i) an emergency indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request from the MCData client 1;
ii) an imminent peril indicator if it is present in the received MCData group
standalone FD request from the MCData client 1; and
iii) an alert indicator if requested to initiate an emergency alert in the
received MCData group standalone FD request from the MCData client 1.
6\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n notifies the user about the incoming
MCData group standalone FD request which may be either accepted or rejected or
ignored. If the request includes mandatory download indication in the MCData
group standalone FD request an accepted response is assumed.
7\. If the target MCData user on MCData clients 2 to n provides a response
(accept or reject) to the notification, then the respective MCData client
sends the MCData group standalone FD response to the MCData server. MCData
client 2 to n automatically sends accepted MCData group standalone FD response
when the incoming request included mandatory download indication.
8\. MCData server forwards the MCData group standalone FD response to the
MCData client 1.
NOTE 3: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 9
depending on the conditions to proceed with the file transmission.
9\. MCData client 1 and MCData server have successfully established media
plane for file transmission and the MCData client 1 transmits the file data.
10\. MCData server distributes the file received from MCData client 1 to
MCData clients 2 to n over the established media plane. Distribution of file
can be via unicast or via MBMS bearer(s). For distribution via MBMS bearer(s),
the procedure described in subclause 7.3 Use of MBMS transmission (on-network)
is executed. File download report is shared by the receiving MCData clients,
if requested by the user at MCData client 1\. After file transaction is
completed, the media plane is released.
NOTE 4: MCData server is not required to wait for the complete download of
file from MCData client 1 prior to initiating file distribution to MCData
client 2.
11\. The MCData clients successfully receiving the file, records file download
completed and notifies MCData user.
12\. MCData client 2 initiates a MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed, if requested by the user at MCData client
1.
13\. The MCData file download completed report(s) from MCData client(s) may be
stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from the
authorized MCData users. The MCData file download completed report from each
MCData user may be aggregated.
14\. Aggregated or individual MCData file download completed report is sent to
the disposition requesting user at MCData client 1.
#### 7.5.2.8 File removal using HTTP by authorized user
##### 7.5.2.8.1 General
The media storage client uses HTTP to remove a file that was previously
uploaded to the MCData content server.
##### 7.5.2.8.2 Procedure for single MCData system
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.8.2-1 describes the case where a MCData user is
removing the file that was previously uploaded to the MCData content server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user on the media storage client is registered for receiving
MCData service.
2\. The file has been successfully uploaded by the MCData user using the
procedures defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
3\. The MCData content server has the ability to verify if the requesting
MCData user is authorised to remove.
Figure 7.5.2.8.2-1: File removal using HTTP by authorised user
1\. The user on the media storage client decides to remove a file that was
previously uploaded.
2\. The URL of the file to be removed is included in the request sent to the
media storage function on the MCData content server.
3\. The MCData content server remove the file indicated by the URL.
4\. The MCData content server informs the media storage client if the file is
successfully removed.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS if and how the recipients of the file URL need to be

#### 7.5.2.9 Void
#### 7.5.2.10 Group standalone file distribution using the MBMS download
delivery method
##### 7.5.2.10.1 General
The initiation of a group standalone FD to a selected group results in
affiliated group members receiving the file data over MBMS.
The first steps of the procedure are identical to the procedure Group
standalone file distribution using HTTP (7.5.2.6). Based on the density and
distribution of target group members, the MCData server may decide to deliver
the file over MBMS.
The MBMS download delivery method is described in clause 7 of 3GPP TS 26.346
[21].
##### 7.5.2.10.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.10.2-1 describes the case where a MCData user is
initiating group standalone data communication for sending a file to multiple
MCData users, with or without download completed report request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users on the MCData client 1 to n belong to the same group and
are already registered for receiving MCData service and affiliated.
2\. The file to be distributed is uploaded to the media storage function on
the MCData content server using the procedure defined in subclause 7.5.2.2.
Figure 7.5.2.10.2-1: Group standalone FD using the MBMS download delivery
method
1-3. Steps 1-3 are the same as in the procedure for Group standalone FD using
HTTP (7.5.2.6).
4\. The MCData server executes the procedure described in subclause 7.3.5. The
MCData server defines, in the MBMS session properties (subclause 5.4 of 3GPP
TS 26.348 [19]), the ingest mode to provide the file into the BM‑SC via xMB‑U.
As described in clause 7.3.5.3.3, the MCData server decides how the file
stored in the MCData content server is provided for distribution over the MBMS
session.
If the pull ingest mode is defined, the MCData server may provide in this step
the file list. As described in 3GPP TS 26.348 [19], the file list includes,
among other information, the file URL to be used by the BM‑SC to fetch the
file and the earliest fetch time. The earliest fetch time may be configured
with a long enough delay so that the MBMS session is established and steps 6
to 8 are executed before the delivery over MBMS. The MCData server can also
update the MBMS session with the file list in a later step.
If the push ingest mode is defined, the MCData server obtains the URL from the
BM‑SC to be used to push the file via xMB‑U. The MCData server ingests the
content into the BM‑SC after the MBMS session is established and steps 6 to 8
are performed.
5\. The MCData server initiates the MCData group standalone FD over MBMS
request towards each MCData user determined in step 3. The request is sent
over unicast or within an MBMS bearer for application level control
signalling.
6\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n notify the users about the incoming
MCData group standalone FD request (including file metadata, if present).
7\. The MCData clients 2 to n automatically send accepted MCData group
standalone FD response when the incoming request included mandatory download
indication.
NOTE 1: When the UE is in idle mode, MCData clients may skip step 8.
NOTE 2: If the pull ingest mode was defined in step 5 and the file list has
not been provided yet, the MCData server updates the MBMS session with the
file list. If the push ingest mode was defined, the MCData server can start
pushing the file for distribution over MBMS.
8\. The MCData server forwards the MCData group standalone FD responses to the
MCData client 1.
NOTE 3: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 6, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the file transmission.
9\. The MCData clients receive the file delivered over MBMS.
10\. If losses occurred during the file delivery over MBMS, the MCData clients
may download the missing parts using the procedures defined in subclause
7.5.2.3.
NOTE 4: If the file is not successfully received over MBMS, e.g. due to a poor
MBMS reception quality, the media storage client of the MCData client(s) can
download the file using the procedure defined in subclause 7.5.2.3.
11\. The MCData clients, after reception, initiate MCData download completed
reports for reporting file download completed, if requested by the user at
MCData client 1.
12\. The MCData file download completed reports from the MCData clients may be
stored by the MCData server for download history interrogation from authorized
MCData users. The MCData file download completed report from each MCData user
may be aggregated.
13\. Aggregated or individual MCData download completed reports are sent by
the MCData server to the MCData user at MCData client 1.

one FD communication to an emergency one-to-one FD communication.
##### 7.5.2.11.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.11.2-1 describes the case where an authorized
MCData user is upgrading a MCData one-to-one FD communication to a MCData
emergency one-to-one FD communication. This procedure is applicable only when
MCData one-to-one file distribution communication is established as described
in subclause 7.5.2.5 \"One-to-one file distribution using media plane\".
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the one-to-one FD communication belong to the same MCData
system.
2\. One-to-one FD communication is already in progress.
Figure 7.5.2.11.2-1 One-to-one FD communication upgrade to an emergency one-
to-one FD communication
1\. The MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an emergency. MCData client 1
sets its MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client
is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
2\. MCData client 1 requests the MCData server to upgrade the MCData one-to-
one FD communication to in-progress emergency by sending a MCData one-to-one
FD upgrade request.
3\. The MCData server sends the MCData one-to-one FD upgrade request towards
MCData client 2.
NOTE 2: MCData client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCData one-to-one FD upgrade request containing the emergency
indicator.
4\. The MCData user of MCData client 2 is notified of the in-progress
emergency of the MCData emergency one-to-one FD communication.
5\. The MCData client 2 acknowledges the MCData one-to-one FD upgrade request
and sends MCData one-to-one FD upgrade response to the MCData server.
6\. The MCData server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for both
participants of the MCData one-to-one FD communication. The priority is
retained until the communication ends.
7\. The MCData server sends MCData one-to-one FD upgrade response to MCData
client 1.
8\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 continue with the MCData one-to-one FD
communication, which has been transformed into an MCData emergency one-to-one
FD communication.
#### 7.5.2.12 Group FD communication upgrade to an emergency group FD
communication
##### 7.5.2.12.1 General
This clause is for adding procedures related to upgrading an existing MCData
group FD communication to an MCData emergency group FD communication.
##### 7.5.2.12.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.12.2-1 describes the case where an authorized
MCData user is upgrading an onging MCData group FD communication to an MCData
emergency group FD communication. This procedure is applicable only when group
MCData FD communication is established as described in subclause 7.5.2.7
\"Group standalone file distribution using media plane\".
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCData server is shown in place of a user
home MCData server and a group hosting MCData server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 are affiliated to that
MCData group.
2\. All members of the MCData group belong to the same MCData system.
3\. An MCData group FD communication is already in progress.
4\. The initiating MCData client 1 has been configured to send an MCData
emergency alert when upgrading an MCData emergency group communication.
Figure 7.5.2.12.2-1: MCData group FD communication upgraded to an MCData
emergency group FD communcation
1\. The MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCData
client 1 sets its MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData
client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client
1.
NOTE 2: While MCData client 1 is in the emergency state, all types of MCData
one-to-one and group communications initiated by MCData client 1 are initiated
as MCData emergency communications.
2\. MCData client 1 requests the MCData server to upgrade the MCData group to
an in-progress emergency state by sending a MCData group FD upgrade request.
The MCData client 1 sets the emergency indicator in the request. If configured
to send an MCData alert when initiating an MCData emergency upgrade, the
request also contains an indication that an MCData alert is to be initiated.
3\. The MCData server sets the emergency state of the MCData group and adjusts
the priority of the underlying bearer for all or selected participants in the
MCData group FD communication that receive the communication over unicast.
NOTE 3: The determination of the selected participants whose bearers have to
be upgraded is left to implementation.
NOTE 4: While the MCData group is in the in-progress emergency state, all
types of MCData communications within the group are processed as emergency
group communications by the MCData server. MCData group members that are not
in the emergency state do not indicate emergency in group communication
requests.
4\. MCData server sends the MCData group FD upgrade request towards the MCData
clients of each of those affiliated MCData group members. The request contains
an indication of an MCData emergency alert if the request from the originator
indicated MCData emergency alert.
5\. MCData users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the MCData
group.
6\. The receiving MCData clients send the MCData group FD upgrade response to
the MCData server to acknowledge the MCData group emergency request. For a
multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCData server sends the MCData group FD upgrade response to the MCData
user 1 to confirm the upgrade request.
NOTE 5: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 continue with the MCData
group FD communication, which has been transformed into an MCData emergency
group FD communication.
#### 7.5.2.13 Group FD communication in-progress emergency group state cancel
##### 7.5.2.13.1 General
This clause describes procedures related to an MCData in-progress emergency
group state cancel. The emergency state of the group can also be cancelled by
the group SDS in-progress emergency state cancellation procedure in subclause
7.4.2.10.2, or by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP
TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.
##### 7.5.2.13.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.5.2.13.2-1 describes the case where an authorized
MCData user cancels MCData group\'s in-progress emergency.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 affiliated to that MCData
group.
2\. All members of the MCData group belong to the same MCData system.
3\. MCData group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.
4\. The MCData group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized
bearer support.
5\. MCData client 1 previously initiated the in-progress emergency for the
group.
Figure 7.5.2.13.2-1: MCData group FD in-progress emergency group state cancel
1\. The user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData group FD in-progress
emergency group state cancel.
NOTE 1: An MCData user authorized to cancel in-progress emergencies on the
MCData group can also be authorised to cancel the MCData emergency alert in
addition to the initiator. However, only the initiator can cancel the
initiator\'s local MCData emergency state.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends an MCData group FD in-progress priority state
cancel request to the MCData server. The MCData client 1 also resets emergency
indicator in the request to inform MCData server about cancellation of in-
progress emergency group state.
NOTE 2: If an MCData emergency alert relating to MCData client 1 is in effect
together with an MCData in-progress emergency group state on the MCData group,
the MCData emergency alert of MCData client 1 can be cancelled at the same
time. In that case, the MCData group FD in-progress priority group state
cancel request carries an indication that the emergency alert of MCData client
1 is also being cancelled.
NOTE 3: If an MCData group FD in-progress priority state cancel request is
received by the MCData server while a group member that is in the emergency
state is transmitting, the MCData group FD in-progress priority state cancel
request is rejected by the MCData server.
3\. The MCData server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCData server cancels/resets the
emergency in-progress state of the MCData group.
4\. The MCData server sends an MCData group FD in-progress priority state
cancel request to the MCData group members.
5\. MCData group members are notified of the MCData group FD in-progress
emergency state cancel.
6\. The receiving MCData clients send the MCData group FD in-progress priority
state cancel response to the MCData server to acknowledge the MCData in-
progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCData server sends the MCData group FD in-progress priority state
cancel response to the MCData user 1 to confirm the MCData in-progress
emergency group state cancel. If the MCData in-progress emergency group state
cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCData
client 1 resets its local emergency status.
NOTE 4: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.

##### 7.5.3.3.2 Procedure
Figure 7.5.3.3.2-1 describes procedures for an off-network MCData client 1
initiating one-to-one MCData data communication for sending standalone FD data
to other MCData client, with or without download completed report request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user 1 has initiated communication for sending standalone FD data
to other MCData user 2.
2\. MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 are members of the same ProSe
Discovery group and are ProSe 1:1 direct communication capable.
3\. MCData client 1 has discovered MCData client 2 in proximity, associated
with MCData user 2, using ProSe Discovery procedures.
Figure 7.5.3.3.2-1: One-to-one standalone file distribution using media plane
1\. MCData client 1 sends a MCData FD request towards the MCData client 2\.
File metadata information is included in the SDP. The MCData FD request
contains one MCData user for one-to-one data communication as selected by the
user at MCData client 1. The MCData FD request contains conversation
identifier for message thread indication. The MCData FD request may include
additional implementation specific information in the application metadata
container. MCData FD request may contain mandatory download indication. The
MCData FD request may contain download completed report indication if selected
by the user at MCData client 1.
2\. On receiving a MCData FD request, the MCData client 2 checks whether any
policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message or content to
certain members, for example, due to location or user privilege.
3\. The receiving MCData client 2 notifies the user about the incoming MCData
FD request which may be either accepted or rejected or ignored. MCData user
may not be sought consent if the request includes mandatory download
indication in the MCData FD request and instead only notify the MCData user
about file downloading.
4\. If the target MCData user 2 provides a response (accept or reject) to the
notification, then the MCData client 2 sends the MCData FD response to the
MCData client 1. MCData client 2 automatically sends accepted MCData FD
response when the incoming request included mandatory download indication.
5\. MCData client 1 distributes the file over the established media plane to
MCData client 2.
6\. The MCData client 2 records file download completed and notifies MCData
user 2. MCData client 2 initiates a MCData download completed report for
reporting file download completed, if requested by the user at MCData client
1.
#### 7.5.3.4 Group standalone file distribution using media plane

#### 7.6.2.2 Automatic transmission for SDS
##### 7.6.2.2.1 General
When SDS message is sent, the data is transferred from the sending MCData
client to the receiving MCData client without any request/grant procedure or
any explicit actions on the part of the receiving MCData client.
##### 7.6.2.2.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.6.2.2.2-1 describes the case where MCData SDS is
automatically transmitted to the selected recipient user or affiliated members
of the selected MCData group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user is configured with permission to transmit data.
2\. Optionally, MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.6.2.2.2-1: Automatic transmission for SDS
1\. MCData user selects the data to transmit and the recipient MCData user or
MCData group. The MCData user at MCData client 1 may include a functional
alias used within the SDS data transmission.
2\. MCData client checks for MCData user\'s permission to transmit data and
checks if the data size is less than the maximum data size for SDS. MCData
client calculates the total transmission request size and determines to select
one of the appropriate procedures described in subclause 7.4.2.2, 7.4.2.3,
7.4.2.5 or 7.4.2.6.
3\. Transmission control on the MCData server verifies if the MCData user is
authorized to transmit and the data size in the received transmission request
does not exceed the maximum data size for SDS. MCData server verifies whether
the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated
for the MCData user.
4\. MCData server may send one of the following MCData control indications:
a) If the MCData user does not have permission to transmit data to another
MCData user or MCData group then the \"No permission to transmit data\"
control indication is sent.
b) If the selected transmission is for a MCData group and there are no
affiliated group members, then the transmission control on MCData server sends
the \"No affiliated members found to the selected MCData group\" control
indication.
c) MCData server may queue the data transmit request for later transmission
with control indication \"Request to transmit is queued\".
Otherwise continue with step 5.
5\. MCData server automatically transmits the data and, if available, the
functional alias of the originating MCData client 1 to the selected MCData
user or the affiliated members or all group members (in the case of lossless
communication) of the selected MCData group according to the procedures
selected in step 2.
6\. The MCData server may store the data in temporary storage (e.g. if the
recipient is not available at the time of data delivery or network congestion
or data deferred by the user) and may send MCData indication to notify the
recipient of available data for retrieval:
a) If the timer expired for periodic announcement with the list of available
recently invited data communications, the recipient MCData client waiting to
receive the temporarily stored data receives MCData indication with the list
of available temporarily stored data waiting to download in the Deferred data
list .
b) If the temporarily stored data is expired, the data may be purged from the
temporary store and the recipient MCData user may be informed in MCData
indication with \"Data expired and not available to download anymore\" in the
Deferred data list.
#### 7.6.2.3 Send data with mandatory download
##### 7.6.2.3.1 General
The mandatory download procedure allows a sending MCData client to send data
to a receiving MCData client, where the receiving MCData client is compelled
to download the data.
##### 7.6.2.3.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.6.2.3.2-1 describes the case where MCData user is
using FD. The FD is subjected to transmission control prior to transmitting
data to the selected recipient user or affiliated members of the selected
MCData group for mandatory download.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user is configured with permission to transmit data.
2\. MCData administrator has configured maximum data size for FD.
3\. Maximum amount of data that a MCData user can transmit in a single request
is configured.
4\. Maximum amount of time that a MCData user can transmit in a single request
is configured.
5\. Optionally, MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be
used.
6\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.6.2.3.2-1: Send data with mandatory download
1\. MCData user selects the data to transmit, the recipient MCData user or
MCData group and the indication for mandatory download. The MCData user at
MCData client 1 may include a functional alias used within the FD data
transfer.
2\. MCData client has checked for MCData user\'s permission to transmit data.
MCData client calculates the total transmission request size and determines to
select one of the appropriate procedures described in subclause 7.5.2.4,
7.5.2.5, 7.5.2.6 or 7.5.2.7 and including the mandatory download indication.
3\. Transmission control on the MCData server verifies if the MCData user is
authorized to transmit, the data size in the received transmission request is
within the maximum size allowed for FD transmission and is within the maximum
amount of time that a MCData user can transmit in a single request. MCData
server verifies whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used
and has been activated for the MCData user.
4\. MCData server may send one of the following MCData control indications:
a) If the MCData user does not have permission to transmit data to another
MCData user or MCData group then the \"No permission to transmit data\"
control indication is sent.
b) If the data size requested to be transmitted is more than the maximum
amount of data that an MCData user can transmit in a single request, the
transmission control on MCData server rejects the data transmission request
and sends the rejection control indication \"Rejected due to exceeding data
transmit size\".
c) If the data transmission time exceeds the maximum amount of time that an
MCData user can transmit in a single request, the transmission control on
MCData server rejects the data transmission request and sends the rejection
control indication \"Rejected due to exceeding data transmit time\".
d) If the selected transmission is for a MCData group and there are no
affiliated group members, then the transmission control on MCData server sends
the \"No affiliated members found to the selected MCData group\" control
indication.
e) MCData server may queue the data transmit request for later transmission
with control indication \"Request to transmit is queued\".
Otherwise continue with step 5.
5\. MCData server transmits the data and, if available, the functional alias
of the originating MCData client 1 to the selected MCData user or the
affiliated members or all group members (in the case of lossless
communication) of the selected MCData group according to the procedures
selected in step 2 (where the recipient MCData client receives the data
automatically).
6\. The MCData server may store the data in temporary storage (e.g. if the
recipient is not available at the time of data delivery or network congestion
or data deferred by the user) and may send MCData indication to notify the
recipient of available data for retrieval:
a) If the timer expired for periodic announcement with the list of available
recently invited data communications, the recipient MCData client waiting to
receive the temporarily stored data receives MCData indication with the list
of available temporarily stored data waiting to download in the Deferred data
list .
b) If the temporarily stored data is expired, the data may be purged from the
temporary store and the recipient MCData user may be informed in MCData
indication with \"Data expired and not available to download anymore\" in the
Deferred data list.
#### 7.6.2.4 Send data without mandatory download
##### 7.6.2.4.1 General
The send data without mandatory download procedure allows the receiving MCData
client to accept download, defer download (i.e. no response) or refuse (e.g.
by the user deleting the notification item) the data sent from the sending
MCData client.
##### 7.6.2.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.6.2.4.2-1 describes the case where MCData user
selected data is subjected to transmission control prior to transmitting data
to the selected recipient user or affiliated members of the selected MCData
group for downloading with recipient MCData user consent.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData user is configured with permission to transmit data.
2\. Maximum amount of data or time that an MCData user can transmit in a
single request is configured.
3\. Time limit for the temporarily stored data waiting to be delivered to a
receiving user is configured.
4\. Optionally, MCData client may have an activated functional alias to be
used.
5\. The MCData server may have subscribed to the MCData functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.6.2.4.2-1: Send data without mandatory download
1\. MCData user selects the data to transmit and the recipient MCData user or
MCData group and does not select the mandatory download indication. The MCData
user at MCData client 1 may include a functional alias used within the data
transmission.
2\. MCData client has checked for MCData user\'s permission to transmit data
and the data size is within the maximum data size allowed. The MCData client
calculates the total transmission request size and determines to select
procedure described in subclause 7.5.2.4, 7.5.2.5, 7.5.2.6 or 7.5.2.7 and
without including the mandatory download indication.
3\. Transmission control on the MCData server verifies if the MCData user is
authorized to transmit, the data size in the received transmission request is
within the maximum data size allowed and is within the maximum amount of time
that a MCData user can transmit in a single request. MCData server verifies
whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been
activated for the MCData user.
4\. MCData server may send one of the following control indications:
a) If the MCData user does not have permission to transmit data to another
MCData user or MCData group then the \"No permission to transmit data\"
control indication is sent.
b) If the selected transmission is for a MCData group and there are no
affiliated group members, then the transmission control on MCData server sends
the \"No affiliated members found to the selected MCData group\" control
indication.
c) If the data size requested to be transmitted is more than the maximum
amount of data that an MCData user can transmit in a single request, the
transmission control on MCData server rejects the data transmission requests
and sends the rejection control indication \"Rejected due to exceeding data
transmit size\".
d) If the data transmission time exceeds the maximum amount of time that an
MCData user can transmit in a single request (applies to DS only), the
transmission control on MCData server rejects the data transmission request
and sends the rejection control indication \"Rejected due to exceeding data
transmit time\".
e) MCData server may queue the data transmit request for later transmission
with a control indication \"Request to transmit is queued\".
Otherwise, continue with step 5.
5\. MCData server transmits the data and, if available, the functional alias
of the originating MCData client 1 to the selected MCData user or the
affiliated members or all group members (in the case of lossless
communication) of the selected MCData group according to the procedures
selected in step 2 (where the recipient MCData client may receive the data
automatically).
6\. The MCData server may store the data in temporary storage (e.g. if the
recipient is not available at the time of data delivery or network congestion
or data deferred by the user) and may send MCData indication to notify the
recipient of available data for retrieval:
a) If the timer expired for periodic announcement with the list of available
recently invited data communications, the recipient MCData client waiting to
receive the temporarily stored data receives MCData indication with the list
of available temporarily stored data waiting to download in the Deferred data
list .
b) If the temporarily stored data is expired, the data may be purged from the
temporary store and the recipient MCData user may be informed in MCData
indication with \"Data expired and not available to download anymore\" in the
Deferred data list.

##### 7.7.2.2.2 Release of MCData communication using media plane
###### 7.7.2.2.2.1 General
The subclause describes the procedure for MCData user initiated MCData
communication release where MCData communication is established as SDS using
media plane or SDS session or file distribution using media plane.
NOTE: The release of MCData communication over MBMS is out of scope of the
current specification.
###### 7.7.2.2.2.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.7.2.2.2.2-1 describes signalling control plane
procedure for the case where MCData communication is ongoing and transmitting
participant initiates MCData communication release. The procedure is
applicable for one-to-one and group MCData communications.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData client 1 and client 2 are already registered for
receiving MCData service.
2\. MCData communication is established between MCData client 1 and MCData
client 2 and MCData client1 is the initiator of the MCData communication.
Figure 7.7.2.2.2.2-1: Release of MCData communication using media plane
1\. MCData user at MCData client 1 requests to release ongoing MCData
communication.
2\. MCData client 1 sends MCData communication release request towards MCData
server, for tearing down the communication with the other MCData client(s).
3\. MCData server sends MCData communication release request to all the
participants of the MCData communication.
4\. Recipient MCData clients notifies respective MCData user about the release
of MCData communication.
5\. MCData clients receiving the MCData communication release request provide
communication release response back towards MCData server.
6\. MCData server sends MCData communication release response back to MCData
client 1.
7\. All participants of the MCData communication have successfully released
the media plane resources associated with the MCData communication that is
released.
8\. MCData client 1 notifies the MCData user about the communication release.
##### 7.7.2.2.3 Release of MCData communication using HTTP
NOTE: The backward compatibility handling of this procedure is outside the
scope of the present document.
#### 7.7.2.3 MCData server initiated communication release without prior

##### 7.7.2.3.1 General
MCData server initiates the release of an ongoing MCData communication, since
at least one of the communication release conditions are met e.g. lack of
bearer capacity, limit for the maximum amount of data or time that a
participant transmits from a single request to transmit exceeded. Based on the
configuration, MCData server either pre-empts the MCData communication without
giving prior indication to MCData client or notifies the intent of release to
the MCData client initiating communication. Latter scenario allows the MCData
user to request for extension of MCData communication and defer the
communication release.
##### 7.7.2.3.2 Release of MCData communication using media plane
###### 7.7.2.3.2.1 General
The subclause describes the procedure for MCData server initiated MCData
communication release without prior indication, where MCData communication is

## 7.12 MCData resource management (on-network)
### 7.12.1 General
Procedures for resource management are defined in subclause 10.11 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [5].
### 7.12.2 Void
## 7.13 Operations on MCData message store
The MCData message store allows an MCData user to deposit his MCData
communication information (i.e. messages or files) securely and permanently
for later retrieval. During an active MCData communication, a message or a
file with its associated metadata is deposited as an object in the MCData
message store with an object identifier; this object identifier enabling a
direct access to that object. The objects in the MCData message store are
managed from both the MCData server and the message store client.
Each MCData user is allocated a dedicated and secured storage area (i.e. with
a user account) in the MCData message store. All MCData communications of a
MCData user can be stored in his dedicated storage area. The access to this
secured storage area is possible only after successful authentication and
authorization procedures. A message store client can create a local copy of
the stored objects into the device by synchronizing with the MCData message
store for the MCData user using the device.
### 7.13.1 MCData message store structure
MCData message store supports a tree like architecture to securely store
MCData communications for the MCData users. Figure 7.13.1 below illustrates
the high-level structure of a MCData message store:
Figure 7.13.1 Message store structure
As illustrated in Figure 7.13.1 all MCData user storage areas are accessed
only through the common root. The authorized MCData user shall only have the
access to the MCData user\'s storage area after the successful authentication
and authorization procedures. A MCData user shall not be able to access
objects stored for other MCData users.
The MCData user shall manage his stored objects using message store client
through the MCData-7 reference point. The MCData server shall use the MCData-8
reference point to deposit MCData communication information, during an active
MCData communication, into the designated MCData user\'s storage area in the
MCData message store.
One way to manage user stored objects is using folder hierarchy structure like
the popular email system today. Annex D provides a simple example of how it
will look like in deployment. When the user account is created in the MCData
message store, a default folder (such as Inbox) is also created to capture all
the objects during an active communication. To group relevant stored objects
together and provide easier navigation interactively, a MCData user can create
folders in his user account. Each folder is identified by its unique folder
identifier that is composed with the location of the folder and the name of
the folder. A folder may have child folders to further group the stored
objects in more meaningful ways. For example, the folder identifier of the
default Inbox folder is /MCDatamessagestore /MCDatauser1/Inbox. The folder
identifier /MCDatamessagestore/MCDatauser1/Squad1/20190225 points to a folder
named 20190225 which is a child folder of Squad1 folder in the MCData user1
user account.
NOTE: The details of how the objects are stored in the MCData message store is
out of scope of the present document.
### 7.13.2 Authentication and authorization
The MCData message store shall authenticate the credential of MCData server or
the authorized MCData user before authorizing access to the MCData user\'s
storage area. The success of authentication and authorization shall allow
access to that MCData user\'s storage area only.
NOTE: The authentication and authorization aspects of MCData message store
access and its operational supports are the responsibility of SA3 and thus
outside the scope of the present document.
### 7.13.3 Manage MCData message store
#### 7.13.3.1 Information flows for managing MCData message store
##### 7.13.3.1.1 MCData retrieve a stored object request
Table 7.13.3.1.1-1 describes the information flow for the MCData retrieve a

(such as WebSockets) the message notification client requests the MCData
notification server to start the PUSH notification service with its specific
protocol that is outside the scope of this specification.
5\. The message store client sends the Subscribe for notification request to
the MCData message store asking to be notified if there are changes to its
message store account. The callback URL returned from the MCData notification
server in step 3 is included in the request for the MCData message store to
use to send notification messages.

### 7.13.6 Interconnection and migration with MCData message store
#### 7.13.6.1 Interconnection
There is no interconnection of MCData message stores, as there are no defined
reference points providing connection between message stores in different
MCData systems.
#### 7.13.6.2 Migration
A migrated MCData user may be provided with access to a local message store by
the partner MCData system of the migrated MCData user. The MCData user is
identified by the MCData ID used in the partner MCData system by that migrated
MCData user in order to access the message store. There is no connection
between this message store in the partner MCData system of the migrated MCData
user and any message store that the MCData user has access to in the primary
MCData system of that MCData user, and therefore access to a message store in
the partner MCData system does not provide a means of accessing stored content
in the primary MCData system of the migrated MCData user.
A migrated MCData user may be provided with a means of access to the message
store in the primary MCData system of that MCData user, e.g. by providing the
MCData user with a suitable APN and appropriate IP routing, or by use of the
MCData IP connectivity service. Such access is outside the scope of the
present document.
## 7.14 IP connectivity
### 7.14.1 General
IP data shall be exchanged between two or more data hosts. The MCData client
as the link between data host and MC system enables the exchange of IP Data.
For addressing the corresponding MCData users either MCData ID or the
functional alias can be used independently of each other. The MCData server
provides the mechanisms to establish the association between MCData ID and
corresponding functional alias.

##### 7.14.2.2.1 General
IP connectivity service capabilities enables MCData unaware data hosts to use
usual MCData service capabilities, e.g. data communication between them. This
subclause describes the establishment of a point-to-point connection between
two IP connectivity clients using the media plane for IP Data transmission.
The target MCData user may be addressed using the functional alias that can be
shared by multiple MCData users.
In order not to violate the point-to-point principle when a functional alias
is shared, only two MCData user can participate to a point-to-point IP
connectivity session. If the MCData server detects that the functional alias
used as the target of the MCData FD request is simultaneously active for
multiple MCData users, then the MCData server can proceed by selecting an
appropriate MCData ID based on some selection criteria. The selection of an
appropriate MCData ID is left to implementation. These selection criteria can
include rejection of the IP connectivity request, if no suitable MCData ID is
selected.
##### 7.14.2.2.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.14.2.2.2-1 describes the case where an IP
connectivity capable MCData client is initiating a point-to-point IP
connectivity with another IP connectivity capable MCData client.

functional alias to the corresponding MCData ID(s) for which the functional
alias is active and proceed with step 4 otherwise proceed with step 6.
4\. The MCData server responds back to MCData client 1 with a functional alias
resolution response message that contains the resolved MCData ID.
5\. If the MCData server replies with a MCData functional alias resolution
response message, the MCData client 1 assumes the MCData IPcon point-to-point
request in step 2 is rejected and sends a new MCData IPcon point-to-point
request towards the resolved MCData ID.
6\. MCData server initiates the MCData IPcon point-to-point request towards
the determined MCData client 2.
NOTE: MCData client 2 corresponds to the MCData user(s) after resolution of
the functional alias.
7\. MCData client 2 sends a MCData IPcon point-to-point response to the MCData
server that contains the information if the request is accepted or the reason
of rejection. If accepted, the MCData client 2 may include the data
transmission time limit.

service and forward the received IP data to the linked data hosts.
## 7.15 Location information (on-network)
The MCData system makes use of all of the procedures for location management
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5], utilising the CSC-14 reference point
between the location management client and location management server and the
CSC‑15 reference point between the MCData server and location management
server.
\- The MC service client is the MCData client;
\- The MC service server is the MCData server;
\- The MC service group is the MCData group;
\- The MC service ID is the MCData ID; and
\- The MC service group ID is the MCData group ID.
## 7.16 Use of ProSe capabilities in off-network MCData communications
### 7.16.1 General
When an MCData user using a ProSe-enabled UE wants to communicate with a
specific MCData group or MCData user using ProSe capabilities, the MCData
client enables the use of the ProSe layer procedures for public safety, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].
For an off-network MCData group communication, the MCData client obtains
configuration data such as the user info ID of the MCData user sending data
and the ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID associated
to the target MCData group (as described in clause 8.1.3.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280
[5]), and provides it to the ProSe layer. The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID of the
target MCData group may be used by the ProSe layer as the target group info
and the discovery group ID (defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).
Prior to initiating an off-network MCData group communication, a group member
discovery procedure may be initiated to identify whether other members of the
target MCData group are in the proximity of the MCData user sending data, as
described in the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure in
3GPP TS 23.303 [7]. The off-network MCData group communication using the ProSe
capability is based on the one-to-many ProSe direct communication procedure
for public safety use described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].
For an off-network one-to-one MCData communication, the MCData client obtains
configuration data such as the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID of
the target MCData user from the \"List of MCData users this MCData user is
authorized to initiate a one to-one communication\" in the MCData user profile
and requests the IP address of the MCData UE associated with the target MCData
user from the ProSe layer.
The MCData client enables the ProSe layer to determine the IP address for the
communication with the target MCData UE by providing the ProSe discovery group
ID and user info ID (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) associated to the
target MCData user. This may trigger the ProSe direct discovery for public
safety use procedure to identify whether the target MCData user is in the
proximity of the MCData user sending data. The user info ID of the target
MCData user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.303 [7]).
The ProSe layer can then provide the IP address related to the target MCData
user to the MCData client to initiate the off-network one-to-one MCData
communication based on the one-to-one ProSe direct communication procedure
described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].
### 7.16.2 Procedures
The off-network MCData communication procedures using the ProSe capabilities
are described within the corresponding clauses of each MCData capability, e.g.
SDS procedures for off-network are described in clause 7.4.3 and file
distribution procedures for off-network are described in clause 7.5.3.
## 7.17 Ad hoc group data communication
### 7.17.1 General
This subclause contains procedures for ad hoc group data communication across
a single MCData system for both SDS and FD services, and associated functions
such as emergency data communication, Imminent peril data communication and
others.
The ad hoc group data communications can use the participants list provided by
either an initiator of the data communication or MCData server. The MCData
server can use the criteria provided by the initiator of the data
communication to determine the participants list along with its own criteria
or local policies. The resulting ad hoc group uses the configuration of a
separate preconfigured MCData group.
NOTE 1: A preconfigured group which is intended only to provide configuration
for the ad hoc group is identified by a parameter in the group configuration
described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
The preconfigured MCData group that provides the configuration is not used for
the MCData group communication, it only provides configuration for one or more
adhoc group data communications. The MCData group ID of the ad hoc group data
communication is provided by the MCData server when the ad hoc group data
communication is originated. In order to establish security context for the
end-to-end secured ad hoc group data communication, the security related
information is used from this preconfigured group.
NOTE 2: The configurations defined for the adhoc group data communication in
user profile and service configuration document as described in the Annex A.3
and A.5 is applicable only for single MCData system.

### 7.17.3 Common Ad hoc group data communication procedures
#### 7.17.3.1 Ad hoc group data communication procedures in single MCData
system
##### 7.17.3.1.1 Ad hoc group data communication setup
Figure 7.17.3.1.1-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group data communication
setup procedure initiated by an authorized user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The authorized user at MCData client 1 wants to invite MCData users at
MCData client 2, MCData client 3 and MCData client 4 for the ad hoc group data
communication or to invite the ad hoc group member if the ad hoc group call
follows an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCData client 1 is aware of the
ad hoc group ID.
2\. Number of participants being invited for the ad hoc group data
communication is within the limit.
3\. End-to-End encryption is supported for this ad hoc group data
communication.
4\. MCData client 1 is aware of the MCData IDs of the participants.
NOTE 1: Selection of MCData IDs of the participants can be manual or from the
user profile configuration data or by any other means. This is left for the
implementation.
5\. The pre-configured group identity and pre-configured group configuration
to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in MCData client and
other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security
related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group
communication.
Figure 7.17.3.1.1-1: Ad hoc group data communication setup
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group data
communication. The MCData client 1 initiates the ad hoc group data
communication by sending the ad hoc group data session request containing the
list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency
alert to the MCData server. Encryption supported information element shall be
set to true since end-to-end encryption is supported. An SDP offer containing
the MCData client media parameters is included. If the MCData user of MCData
client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group data session
request contains that functional alias.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency ad hoc
group data communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for the
MCData client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i. the MCData ad hoc group data session request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii. if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client 1 is
retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
2\. If the ad hoc group communication is supported, the MCData server verifies
whether the user at MCData client 1 is authorized to initiate an ad hoc group
data session request. If not authorized, the MCData server rejects the ad hoc
group data session request as specified in the step 3. The MCData server
accepts the ad hoc group data session request if the ad hoc group data
communication is supported and authorized. If authorised, it validates whether
the number of invited participants is within the configured limit before
proceeding with the data communication setup.
If functional alias is present, the MCData server checks whether the provided
functional alias allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
If location information was included in the ad hoc group data session request,
the MCData server checks the privacy policy of the MCData user to decide if
the location information of MCData client 1 can be provided to other users on
the ad hoc group data communication (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to
provide location information to other MCData users on a data communication
when talking\").
> If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData ad hoc group
> data session request, the MCData ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-
> progress emergency state until this ad hoc group data communication is
> terminated; and
>
> If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData ad hoc
> group data session request, the MCData ad hoc group is considered to be in
> the in-progress imminent peril state until this ad hoc group data
> communication is terminated.
If the information received in the request in step 1 does not contain an ad
hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCData server forms the
ad hoc group by using received information, and determines the preconfigured
group to be used for the configuration of the ad hoc group. The MCData server
assigns a MCData group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.
> The MCData server considers the ad hoc group data communication participants
> as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
>
> 3\. The MCData server shall send the ad hoc group data session request
> return message to MCData client 1 containing the below:
i. The MCData ad hoc group ID, either generated by the MCData server, if not
included in the ad hoc group call request of step 1, or if the provided MCData
ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the MCData server; or provided by the
MCData client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency
alert;
ii. The group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group
communication (only included when the ad hoc group data session is
authorized); and
iii. Result of whether the ad hoc group data session request is authorized or
not
> If the ad hoc group data session request is not authorized, the MCData
> server and MCData client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4a-4c. The MCData server sends the ad hoc group data session requests towards
the MCData clients of the invited users based on step 1. While sending the ad
hoc group data session requests, the MCData server shall remove the
information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCData
clients (e.g. MCData ID list of the users who are required to acknowledge)
5a-5c. The receiving MCData clients notify their corresponding MCData user
about the incoming ad hoc group data session request with the information of
the MCData group ID for the ad hoc group.
6a-6c. The receiving MCData clients may accept or reject the ad hoc group data
session requests and send ad hoc group data session responses to the MCData
server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding
MCData user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the
MCData server.
7\. The MCData server sends the ad hoc group data session response to MCData
client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful data
communication establishment.
NOTE 2: Steps 5 to step 7 can start to occur before all of step 4 is completed
since the MCData server do not require to wait for the previous ad hoc group
data session request to complete before sending the ad hoc group data session
request to another participant.
8\. If the initiating MCData user requires the acknowledgement from the
invited MCData users, and the required MCData users do not acknowledge the
data session setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged data
communication setup timeout\"), then the MCData server may proceed with or
abandon the data session and then notify the initiating MCData user that the
acknowledgements did not include all required members according to ad hoc
group data communication policy from the user profile configuration. The
MCData server may notify the initiating MCData user of all MCData users who
did not acknowledge the ad hoc group data session request within the
configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCData user
by the MCData server more than once during the data communication when MCData
users join or leave the MCData ad hoc group data communication.
9\. MCData client 1, MCData client 2, MCData client 3 and MCData client 4
establish media plane for data communication.
NOTE 3: Step 9 can occur any time following step 7 if the conditions to
proceed with the data communication are met.
##### 7.17.3.1.2 Release ad hoc group data communication
The procedure focuses on the case where the MCData server releases an ongoing
MCData ad hoc group data communication for all the participants of that ad hoc
group data communication, since at least one of the release conditions are met
e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving.
Figure 7.17.3.1.2-1 below illustrates the signalling control plane procedure
for the MCData server initiating termination of an ongoing ad hoc group data
communication.
Figure 7.17.3.1.2-1: Release ad hoc group data communication
1\. It is assumed that MCData users on MCData client 1, client 2 and client 3
are already part of the ongoing ad hoc group data communication.
2\. MCData server would like to release the MCData ad hoc group data
communication which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant
leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving.
3\. MCData server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group data
communication and generates ad hoc group data session release request to
release ongoing data communication. The MCData server cancels the in-progress
emergency state or in-progress imminent peril state of the ad hoc group if the
ad hoc group data communication is an emergency or imminent peril data
communication respectively.
4\. MCData server sends ad hoc group data session release request via SIP core
towards each participant of the ongoing ad hoc group data communication.
5\. MCData users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group data
communication.
6\. MCData client(s) receiving ad hoc group data session release request,
acknowledge towards the MCData server by sending an ad hoc group data session
release response.
NOTE: If the initiator of the ad hoc group data communication does not supply
the participants list, the MCData client(s) may choose to store the list of
participants for easy re-initiation of another ad hoc group data communication
with the same participants.
7\. MCData client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group data communication that
is terminated and the ad hoc group ceases to exist (i.e., further data
communication is not possible over the same ad hoc group), otherwise if the ad
hoc group data communication follows an ad hoc group emergency alert the ad
hoc group continues to exist (i.e., further data communication is possible
over the same ad hoc group).
##### 7.17.3.1.3 Ad hoc group data communication setup with MCData server
determining the participants lists
Figure 7.17.3.1.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group data communication
setup procedure initiated by the MCData user and MCData client 1 wherein the
list of participants is determined by the MCData server based on the citeria
received from the MCData client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData user at MCData client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc group
data communication.
2\. The MCData user at MCData client 1 wants to invite MCData users who are
satisying certain criteria for the ad hoc group data communication.
Figure 7.17.3.1.3-1: Ad hoc group data communication participants determined
by MCData server
1\. User at MCData client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group data
communication in-order to invite the participants satisfying specific
criteria. The MCData client 1 initiates the ad hoc group data communication by
sending the ad hoc group data session request containing the details of the
criteria to be applied by the MCData server for determining the participants
list. If end-to-end encryption is supported, the Encryption supported
information element shall be set to true and pre-configured MCData group whose
configuration is to be applied is included. An SDP offer containing the MCData
client media parameters is included. If the MCData user of MCData client 1 has
selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group data session request
contains that functional alias.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an MCData emergency ad hoc
group data communication or the MCData emergency state is already set for the
MCData client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency alert):
i. the MCData ad hoc group data session request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii. if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state of MCData client 1 is
retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCData client 1.
2\. If the ad hoc group data communication is supported, the MCData server
verifies whether the user at MCData client 1 is authorized to initiate an ad
hoc group data communication. If not authorized, the MCData server rejects the
ad hoc group data session request as specified in the step 3. The MCData
server accepts the ad hoc group data session request if the ad hoc group data
communication is supported and authorized.
If functional alias is present, the MCData server checks whether the provided
functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
If location information was included in the ad hoc group data session request,
the MCData server checks the privacy policy of the MCData user to decide if
the location information of MCData client 1 can be provided to other users on
the data communication (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location
information to other MCData users on a data communication when talking\").
If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCData ad hoc group data
session request, the MCData ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-
progress emergency state until this ad hoc group data communication is
terminated;
If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCData ad hoc group
data session request, the MCData ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-
progress imminent peril state until this ad hoc group data communication is
terminated. and
If the information received in the request in step 1 does not contain an ad
hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCData server forms the
ad hoc group by using received information, and determines the preconfigured
group to be used for the configuration of the ad hoc group. The MCData server
assigns a MCData group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group. Further, the ad
hoc group participants are included to ad hoc group once determined as
specified in the step 4.
3\. The MCData server shall send the ad hoc group data session request return
message to MCData client 1 containing the below:
i. The MCData ad hoc group ID, either generated by the MCData server, if not
included in the ad hoc group call request of step 1, or if the provided MCData
ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the MCData server, or provided by the
MCData client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency
alert;
ii. The group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group
communication (only included when the ad hoc group data session is
authorized); and
iii. Result of whether the ad hoc group data session request is authorized or
not
If the ad hoc group data session request is not authorized, the MCData server
and MCData client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4\. The MCData server determines the list of participants to be invited for
the ad hoc group data communication based on the information present in the
information element Criteria for determining the participants. This
information element could carry either criteria or indicator identifying pre-
defined criteria or a combination of both.
NOTE 1: The content of the Criteria information element, the details of the
pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MCData server determines the list
of participants are left to implementation.
5\. The MCData server sends the ad hoc group data session requests towards the
MCData clients 2 and 3. While sending the ad hoc group data session requests,
the MCData server shall remove the information elements that are not required
to be conveyed to the target MCData clients. This request carries the pre-
configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group
data communication if end-to-end encryption is requested. The MCData server
considers the ad hoc group data communication participants as implicitly
affiliated to the ad hoc group.
6\. The receiving MCData clients notify their corresponding MCData user about
the incoming ad hoc group data communication.
7\. The receiving MCData clients may accept or reject the ad hoc group data
session requests and send ad hoc group data session responses to the MCData
server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding
MCData user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the
MCData server.
8\. The MCData server sends the ad hoc group data session response to MCData
client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful data
communication establishment.
9\. The MCData server may notify the initiating MCData user of all MCData
users who acknowledged the ad hoc group data session request and joined the ad
hoc group data communication. This notification may be sent to the initiating
MCData user by the MCData server more than once during the data communication
when MCData users join or leave the MCData ad hoc group data communication. If
the authorized users (not shown in figure) are configured to receive the
participants information of ad hoc group data communication, the MCData server
provides ad hoc group data session notify about all MCData users who
acknowledged the ad hoc group data session request and joined the ad hoc group
data communication, and when MCData users joins or leaves the MCData ad hoc
group data communication.
NOTE 2: The authorized user can learn who is currently affiliated to the
current adhoc group data communication.
10\. MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 establish media
plane resources.
##### 7.17.3.1.4 Modification of ad hoc group data communication participants
by the initiator

verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCData server.
11\. The MCData server may notify the initiating MCData user of all the users
who are added to the on-going ad hoc group data communication. This
notification may be sent to the initiating MCData user by the MCData server
more than once during the data communication when MCData users join or leave
the ad hoc group data communication.
12\. The MCData server may notify the participants about the change in the
participants list of on-going ad hoc group data communication.
##### 7.17.3.1.5 Modification of ad hoc group data communication participants
by the MCData server

#### 7.17.3.2 Ad hoc group data communication involving multiple MC systems
##### 7.17.3.2.1 Procedure for ad hoc group data communication setup --
Participants list provided by the Initiator
Figure 7.17.3.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for ad hoc group data
communication setup procedure initiated by an authorized user wherein either a
list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency
alert is provided by the authorised user and the determined MCData users are
from multiple MCData systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MC system shares
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The authorized MCData user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.
3\. The MCData server of the primary MC system is where the authorized MCData
user/dispatcher creates the ad hoc group.
4\. Some users of the ad hoc group belong to partner MC systems.
5\. The preconfigured group identity and preconfigured group configuration
(e.g. security related information) to be used for an ad hoc group have been
preconfigured in the MCData client and other participants of ad hoc group have
also received the relevant security related information to allow them to
communicate in an ad hoc group communication.
6\. If an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert is used to
invite the ad hoc group members, MCData client is aware of the ad hoc group
ID.
Figure 7.17.3.2.1-1: Ad hoc group data communication setup
1\. The MCData client of the authorized user initiates an ad hoc group data
communication with multiple users from primary and partner MC systems. An ad
hoc group data session request message with the information of the
participants MCData IDs or an ad hoc group ID if the ad hoc group call follows
an ad hoc group emergency alert is routed to the MCData server of the primary
MC system.
2\. If the ad hoc group call is supported, the MCData server of the primary MC
system verifies whether the user at MCData client is authorized to initiate an
ad hoc group communication. If not authorized, the MCData server of the
primary MC system rejects the ad hoc group data session request as specified
in the step 3.
If the information received in the request in step 1 does not contain an ad
hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCData server of the
primary MC system forms the ad hoc group by using information received in step
1 and further determines the preconfigured group to be used for the
configuration (e.g. security related information). The MCData server assigns
an MCData ad hoc group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.
If no MCData ad hoc group ID was included in the ad hoc group data session
request of step 1, or if the provided MCData ad hoc group ID is not accepted
by the MCData server, the MCData server assigns a MCData group ID for the
newly formed ad hoc group. The MCData server considers the ad hoc group
communication participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
NOTE 1: The newly formed ad hoc group information including the MCData group
ID and the list of users is held in dynamic data in the MCData server.
3\. The MCData server shall send the ad hoc group data session request return
message to MCData client containing the below:
i. The MCData ad hoc group ID either generated by the MCData server or
provided by the MCData client if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group
emergency alert (only included when the ad hoc group data session request is
authorized);
ii. The group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group
data communication (only included when the ad hoc group data session request
is authorized); and
iii. Result of whether the ad hoc group data session request is authorized or
not.
If the ad hoc group data session request is not authorized, MCData client 1
shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4\. The MCData server of the primary MC system sends the ad hoc group data
session request to the group members of the ad hoc group belonging to the
primary MC system. While sending the ad hoc group data session requests, the
MCData server shall remove the information elements that are not required to
be conveyed to the target MCData clients (e.g. MCData ID list of the users who
are required to acknowledge).
5a-5b. The MCData clients receive in the ad hoc group data session request
with the information of the MCData group ID for the ad hoc group and further
notify their corresponding MCData user. The group members of the ad hoc group
of the primary MC system may accept or reject the ad hoc group data session
requests and respond with the ad hoc group data session responses.
6\. The primary MCData server further initiates an ad hoc group data session
request message to the MCData users of the partner MC system. The ad hoc group
data session request message is routed to the MCData users via the MCData
server of the partner MC system.
7a-7b. The MCData clients receive in the ad hoc group data session request the
information of the MCData group ID for the ad hoc group and further notify
their corresponding MCData user. The MCData users upon receipt of the
invitation may accept or reject the ad hoc group data session requests, and
respond with the ad hoc group data session responses. The ad hoc group data
session response message is routed to the MCData server of the primary MC
system via the MCData server of the partner MC system.
8\. The MCData server of the primary MC system provides an ad hoc group data
session response message to the MCData client of the authorized MCData user
upon receiving response to the corresponding ad hoc group data session request
in step 1. The ad hoc group data session response will consist of the success
or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of failure.
NOTE 2: The ad hoc group data session response messages may be used by The
MCData client of the authorized user to determine if the ad hoc group
communication will proceed.
9\. Upon successful ad hoc group data session setup, a group data
communication is established amongst the group members from primary and
partner MC systems. The media plane resources for data communication are
established.
##### 7.17.3.2.2 Procedure for ad hoc group data communication release by
MCData server -- Participants list provided by the Initiator
This procedure focuses on the case where an MCData server initiates the
termination of an ongoing MCData ad hoc group data communication for all the
participants of that group data communication, since at least one of the
termination conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant
leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number
of affiliated MCData group members are not present.
Procedures in figure 7.17.3.2.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCData server initiating termination of an ongoing MCData ad hoc group
data communication.
Pre-condition:
\- The MCData client 1 and MCData client 2 belong to primary MC system. The
MCData client 3 belongs to partner MC system.
\- The MCData users on MCData client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part
of the ongoing ad hoc group data communication (e.g. as a result of ad hoc
group data communication setup as specified in clause 7.17.3.2.1).
Figure 7.17.3.2.2-1: Ad hoc group data communication release
1\. The MCData server determines to release the ongoing ad hoc group data
communication e.g., due to a hang timer expiry, last participant leaving,
second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or a minimum number of
affiliated MCData group members not present.
2\. The MCData server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group
data communication and generates ad hoc group data session release request to
release ongoing data communication.
3\. The MCData server sends an ad hoc group data session release request to
each participant of the ongoing group data communication. If the participants
belong to the partner MC system, then the ad hoc group data session release
request is routed to the MCData clients of the partner MC system via the
partner MCData server.
4\. The MCData users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group data
communication.
5\. The MCData client(s), send an acknowledgment to the MCData server by
sending an ad hoc group data session release response.
6\. The MCData client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released
media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group data communication that
is terminated. The primary MCData server removes the ad hoc group information
from the dynamic data and thus the ad hoc group ceases to exist.
##### 7.17.3.2.3 Ad hoc group data communication setup -- Participants list
determined by the MCData server
Figure 7.17.3.2.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group data communication
setup procedure initiated by an authorized user wherein the list of
participants is determined by the MCData server based on the citeria received
from the MCData client and determined MCData users are from multiple MCData
systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MC system share
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The authorized MCData user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.
3\. The MCData server 1 of the primary MC system is where the authorized
MCData user/dispatcher creates the ad hoc group.
4\. Some users of the ad hoc group may belong to MCData server 2 of the
partner MC systems.
5\. The pre-configured group identity and pre-configured group configuration
to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in MCData client and
other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security
related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group
communication.
Figure 7.17.3.2.3-1: Ad hoc group data communication setup involving multiple
MCData systems
1-3. Same as described in subclause 7.17.3.1.1.
4\. The MCData server 1 determines the list of participants from the primary
MC system and determines the partner MC system to be involved in the ad hoc
group data communication based on the information present in the information
element Criteria for determining the participants. This information element
carries the criteria, indicator identifying pre-defined criteria, or a
combination of both.
NOTE 1: The content of the Criteria information element, the details of the
pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MCData server determines the list
of participants are left to implementation.
5\. The MCData server 1 needs to involve the partner MC system based on the
agreement and based on the criteria for determining the participants list, it
sends the ad hoc group data session get userlist request to the MCData server
2. This request carries the criteria specified in the step 1.
6\. MCData server 2 evaluates the criteria and determines the participants
satisfying the criteria (i.e. MCData client 3 and MCData client 4) and sends
the response containing the list of MCData users satisfying the criteria. The
MCData server 2 may apply local policies if any while determining the
participants satisfying the criteria.
7\. The MCData server 1 compiles the list of participants to be invited for
the ad hoc group data communication including the participants from both
primary and partner MC system.
8a-8b. The MCData server 1 sends the ad hoc group data session request towards
the MCData client 3 and MCData client 4. While sending the ad hoc group data
session request, the MCData server shall remove the information elements that
are not required to be conveyed to the target MCData clients. This request
carries the pre-configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for
this ad hoc group data communication if end-to-end encryption is requested.
The MCData server 1 considers the ad hoc group communication participants as
implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
9\. The MCData server 1 sends the ad hoc group data session request towards
the MCData client 2. While sending the ad hoc group data session request, the
MCData server shall remove the information elements that are not required to
be conveyed to the target MCData clients. This request carries the pre-
configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group
data communication if end-to-end encryption is requested.
10a-10c. The MCData clients receive incoming ad hoc group data communication
and further notify their corresponding MCData users.
11\. The MCData client 2 accepts the ad hoc group data session request, and
sends ad hoc group data session response to the MCData server 1.
12\. The MCData client 3 accepts the ad hoc group data session request, and
sends ad hoc group data session response to the MCData server 1.
13\. The MCData client 4 accepts the ad hoc group data session request, and
sends ad hoc group data session response to the MCData server 1.
14\. The MCData server 1 sends the ad hoc group data session response to
MCData client 1 through the signalling path to inform about result of the
participants responses.
15\. The MCData server 1 may notify the initiating MCData user of all MCData
users who acknowledged the ad hoc group data session request and joined the ad
hoc group data communication. The MCData server 1 more than once during the
data communication may send this notification to the initiating MCData user
whenever an MCData user joins or leaves the MCData ad hoc group data
communication. If the authorized users (not shown in figure) are configured to
receive the participants information of ad hoc group data communication, the
MCData server provides ad hoc group data session notify about all MCData users
who acknowledged the ad hoc group data session request and joined the ad hoc
group data communication, and when MCData users joins or leaves the MCData ad
hoc group data communication.
16\. The MCData client 1, MCData client 2, MCData client 3 and MCData client 4
establish media plane resources for data communication.
NOTE 2: The ad hoc group data session request and response exchanged between
MCData server 1 of primary MC system and MCData client 3/MCData client 4 will
always traversal through the MCData server 2.

##### 7.17.6.2.1 Determine the ad hoc group and preconfigured group for end-
to-end encryption
The procedure in figure 7.17.6.2.1-1 describes about determining the MCData ad
hoc group ID and preconfigured group identity of preconfigured group from
which the configurations to be used (e.g. security related information).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCData users belong to primary MCData system and partner MCData system
and already registered for receiving MCData service.
NOTE 1: Selection of MCData IDs of the ad hoc group members receiving the SDS
data can be manual or from the user profile configuration data or by any other
means. This is left for the implementation.
2\. Number of ad hoc group members receiving the SDS data should be within the
configured limit.
Figure 7.17.6.2.1-1: Determine ad hoc group and preconfigured group
1\. The user at MCData client 1 wants to initiate an SDS data transfer to
multiple MCData users with/without end-to-end encryption supported, and either
by providing the list of MCData users in the request or by providing the
certain criteria in the request.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends a Determine ad hoc group request towards the
MCData server of the primary MCData system. The Determine ad hoc group request
contains either the criteria to be applied by the MCData server of the primary
MCData system for determining the list of MCData users or the list of MCData
users as selected by the user at MCData client 1. The request may also contain
the indicator for data transfer is for emergency, imminent peril and the
application identifier for which the data transfer is intended.
3\. If the ad hoc group communication is supported, the MCData server of the
primary MCData system checks whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is
authorized to initiate a Determine ad hoc group request. If not authorized,
the MCData server rejects the Determine ad hoc group request as specified in
the step 9. If the request contains the list of MCData users as selected by
the user at MCData client 1, the MCData server of the primary MCData system
validates whether the number of MCData users provided in the request are
within the configured limit. If not within the configured limit, the MCData
server rejects the Determine ad hoc group request as specified in the step 9.
4\. If the request contains the criteria, the MCData server of primary MCData
system determines the list of MCData users for ad hoc group standalone short
data service from the primary MCData system and determines the partner MCData
system to be involved in the ad hoc group standalone short data service based
on the criteria and according to local policy if required. This information
element to determine the ad hoc group member contains the criteria, indicator
identifying pre-defined criteria, or a combination of both.
NOTE 1: The values of criteria, indicator identifying pre-defined criteria and
determining the list of participants using these values by MCData server is
left to implementation.
5\. The MCData server of primary MCData system involves the partner MCData
system based on the agreement, based on the criteria for determining the list
of MCData users, and according to local policy if required. It sends the ad
hoc group standalone data get userlist request to the MCData server of partner
MCData system. This request carries the criteria received in the Determine ad
hoc group request.
6\. The MCData server of partner MCData system determines the list of MCData
users satisfying the criteria and sends the response containing the list of
MCData users satisfying the criteria. The MCData server of partner MCData
system may apply local policies if any while determining the participants
satisfying the criteria. The determination of list of MCData users is
performed only once.
7\. The MCData server of primary MCData system compiles the list of MCData
users for ad hoc group standalone short data service from primary MCData
system and from partner MCData system, if requested.
NOTE 2: The step 4 to step 7 are applicable if the request contains the
criteria for determining the ad hoc group members from primary system and may
be from partner system.
8\. The MCData server of the primary MCData system forms the ad hoc group by
using MCData users\' information received in the Determine ad hoc group
request and list of MCData users to be part of ad hoc group. The MCData server
further determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration
(e.g. security related information) of the ad hoc group if end-to-end
encryption is required. The MCData server selects an MCData ad hoc group ID
for the newly formed ad hoc group and optionally assign the time to live
value. The ad hoc group members can communicate in the ad hoc group until the
time to live value is expired. The MCData server ensure the list of MCData
users determined in the step 7 are within the configured limit.
NOTE 3: How the MCData server decides list of participants is implementation
specific.
9\. The MCData server of the primary MCData system send the Determine ad hoc
group response message to MCData client 1 containing the below:
i. The MCData ad hoc group ID (only included when the Determine ad hoc group
request is succesful);
ii. The MCData group ID of the pre-configured group whose configuration is to
be applied for this Ad hoc group standalone short data service if end-to-end
encryption is required (only included when the Determine ad hoc group request
is succesful); and
iii. Result of whether the Determine ad hoc group request successful or
failure.
> If the Determine ad hoc group request not authorized or result not
> succesful, the MCData client 1 shall not proceed with remaining steps for
> the data transfer as specified in the clause 7.17.6.3 and 7.17.6.4.
#### 7.17.6.3 Ad hoc group standalone short data service using signalling
control plane involving single MCData system
##### 7.17.6.3.1 General
The initiation of Ad hoc group standalone short data service using signalling
control plane results in ad hoc group members from single MCData system
receiving the SDS data. The SDS payload data size is assumed to be below the
configured maximum payload data size for SDS over signalling control plane.
##### 7.17.6.3.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.17.6.3.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user
is initiating ad hoc group standalone short data service using signalling
control plane with or without disposition request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCData users on MCData clients 1 to n belong to the same MCData system and
are already registered for receiving MCData service.
2\. Number of ad hoc group members receiving the SDS data is within the
configured limit.
3\. The preconfigured group identity and preconfigured group configuration
(e.g. security related information) to be used for an ad hoc group have been
preconfigured in the MCData client and other MCData users of ad hoc group have
also received the relevant security related information.
Figure 7.17.6.3.2-1: Ad hoc group standalone short data service involving
single MCData system
1\. The user at MCData client 1 wants initiates an SDS data transfer to ad hoc
group members from primary MCData system.
2\. The MCData client 1 shall determine the preconfigured group if end-to-end
encryption is required and an ad hoc group by executing the procedures as
described in the clause 7.17.6.2.
3\. MCData client 1 sends an Ad hoc group standalone data request towards the
MCData server. The request shall contain the MCData ad hoc group ID as
determined in the step 2, the conversation identifier for message thread
indication, may include additional implementation specific information in the
application metadata container, may contain disposition request if indicated
by the user at MCData client 1 and may include associated functional alias of
the user at MCData client 1. If end-to-end encryption is required, the request
shall contain the Preconfigured MCData group ID as determined in the step 2.
If the end-to-end encryption is not required then include the payload without
encryption and if required then include the payload with encryption based on
the Preconfigured MCData group ID as determined in the step 2.
> If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an emergency ad hoc group
> standalone short data service or the MCData emergency state is already set
> for the MCData client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCData emergency
> alert):
i) the Ad hoc group standalone data request shall contain an emergency
indicator;
ii) if the MCData emergency state is not set already, MCData client 1 sets its
MCData emergency state. The MCData emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled; and
iii) once an emergency SDS data transfer has been initiated, the ad hoc group
is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until SDS data transfer
is completed and the time to live value of ad hoc group expires.
If the MCData user at MCData client 1 initiates an imminent peril ad hoc group
standalone short data service:
i) the Ad hoc group standalone data request shall contain imminent peril
indicator; and
ii) once an emergency SDS data transfer has been initiated, the ad hoc group
is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until SDS data
transfer is completed and the time to live value of ad hoc group expires.
4\. If the ad hoc group communication is supported, the MCData server checks
whether the MCData user at MCData client 1 is authorized to send Ad hoc group
standalone data request. If not authorized, the MCData server rejects the Ad
hoc group standalone data request as specified in the step 9. The MCData
server checks whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of
message or content to certain members, for example, to location or user
privilege. The MCData server also verifies whether the provided functional
alias can be used and has been activated for the user.
5\. The MCData server considers the the ad hoc group memebers as implicitly
affiliated to the ad hoc group.
i) If an emergency indicator is present in the received Ad hoc group
standalone data request and if the ad hoc group is not in the in-progress
emergency state, the ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
emergency state until SDS data transfer is completed and the time to live
value of ad hoc group expires; and
ii) If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received Ad hoc group
standalone data request and if the ad hoc group is not in the in-progress
imminent peril state, the ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until SDS data transfer is completed and the time to live
value of ad hoc group expires; and
6\. The MCData server initiates a Ad hoc group standalone data request towards
each of the target MCData users. While sending the Ad hoc group standalone
data request, the MCData server shall remove the information elements that are
not required to be conveyed to the target MCData clients (e.g. MCData ID
list). The request should contain the ad hoc group ID, pre-configured group if
end-to-end encryption is required and time to live value for the ad hoc group.
The primary MCData server removes the ad hoc group information from the
dynamic data once the time to live value is expired and thus the ad hoc group
ceases to exist then the procedure stops.
7\. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData
clients 2 to n may be notified. Otherwise if the payload is not for MCData
user consumption, then the MCData user of MCData clients 2 to n shall not be
notified. The action taken when the payload contains application data or
command instructions are specific based on the contents of the payload.
Payload content received by MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known
local non-MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the MCData
client 2 to start the local non-MCData application (i.e., remote start
application) and shall pass the payload content to the just started
application.
8\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData client(s) initiates a MCData data
disposition notification for delivery report as described in the step 6 to
step 9 of clause 7.4.2.5.2.
#### 7.17.6.4 Ad hoc group standalone short data service using signalling
control plane involving multiple MCData system
##### 7.17.6.4.1 General
The initiation of Ad hoc group standalone short data service using signalling
control plane results in ad hoc group members from multiple MCData system
receiving the SDS data. The SDS payload data size is assumed to be below the
configured maximum payload data size for SDS over signalling control plane.
##### 7.17.6.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.17.6.4.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user
is initiating ad hoc group standalone short data service using signalling
control plane with or without disposition request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCData systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MCData system
share their users\' information to the primary MCData system.
2\. MCData users on MCData clients 1 to M belong to the primary MCData system
and MCData users on MCData clients 1 to N belong to the partner MCData system
and are already registered for receiving MCData service.
3\. The MCData server of the primary MCData system is where the authorized
MCData user/dispatcher creates the ad hoc group.
4\. Number of ad hoc group members receiving the SDS data is within configured
limit.
5\. The preconfigured group identity and preconfigured group configuration
(e.g. security related information) to be used for an ad hoc group have been
preconfigured in the MCData client and other MCData users of ad hoc group have
also received the relevant security related information.
Figure 7.17.6.4.2-1: Ad hoc group standalone short data service involving
multiple MCData system
1\. The user at MCData client 1 of the primary MCData system wants initiates
an SDS data transfer to ad hoc group members from primary and partner MCData
systems.
2-5. Same steps as described in the steps 2 to 5 of clause 7.17.6.3.2.
6-6a. The MCData server of the primary MCData system initiates an Ad hoc group
standalone data request towards each of the target MCData users in the primary
MCData system and the partner MCData system. While sending the Ad hoc group
standalone data requests, the MCData server of the primary MCData system shall
remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the
target MCData clients (e.g. MCData ID list). The request should contain the ad
hoc group ID, pre-configured group if end-to-end encryption is required and
time to live value for the ad hoc group. The primary MCData server removes the
ad hoc group information from the dynamic data once the time to live value is
expired and thus the ad hoc group ceases to exist then the procedure stops.
7-7a. If the payload is for MCData user consumption (e.g. is not application
data, is not command instructions, etc.) then the MCData user of MCData
clients 2 to M and MCData clients 1 to N may be notified. Otherwise if the
payload is not for MCData user consumption, then the MCData user of MCData
clients 2 to M and MCData clients 1 to N shall not be notified. The action
taken when the payload contains application data or command instructions are
specific based on the contents of the payload. Payload content received by
MCData clients 2 to M and MCData clients 1 to N which is addressed to a known
local non-MCData application that is not yet running shall cause the clients 2
to M and MCData clients 1 to N to start the local non-MCData application
(i.e., remote start application) and shall pass the payload content to the
just started application.
8\. If the MCData data disposition for delivery was requested by the user at
MCData client 1 of the primary MCData system, then the receiving MCData
client(s) initiates a MCData data disposition notification for delivery report
as described in the step 6 to step 9 of clause 7.4.2.5.2.
###### ## Annex A (normative): MCData related configuration data
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
for the MCData service, which belongs to one of the following categories:
\- MCData UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MCData user profile configuration data (see subclause A.3);
\- MCData related group configuration data (see subclause A.4); and
\- MCData service configuration data (see subclause A.5).
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both on network and off network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCData UE,
MCData group, MCData user and MCData service configuration data refers to the
information that will be stored against each MCData UE, MCData group, MCData
user and MCData service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network
and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration
category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data
category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.282
[3] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] or the corresponding subclause from either the
present document or the referenced document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the
configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-
network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within
the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character
\">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level.
Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\"
character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MCData UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MCData UE configuration data
The general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5].
Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCData UE after MCData
authorization.
Data in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference
point. Table A.2-1 contains the UE configuration required to support the use
of off-network MCData service.

# A.3 MCData user profile configuration data
The general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]. The MCData user profile configuration data is
stored in the MCData user database. The MCData server obtains the MCData user
profile configuration data from the MCData user database (MCData-2).
Tables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCData user profile configuration required
to support the use of on-network MCData service. Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3
contain the MCData user profile configuration required to support the use of
off-network MCData service. Data in table A.3-1 and A.3-3 can be configured
offline using the CSC-11 reference point.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Transmission control for MCData
# B.1 Overview of transmission control process
The MCData server may receive several simultaneous requests for data
transmission, which may be associated with different types of communication
e.g. group, private, 1-to-many. For each communication, how the requests are
processed may be different. The requests that are not authorized shall be
rejected by the transmission control function. For message requests over the
signalling control plane, the processing should be immediate and is delivered
to the recipients either via unicast or broadcast. However, for message
requests over the media plane, transmission control arbitration (see Annex
B.2) will be necessary. Subsequent to transmission control arbitration, and
subject to the policy e.g. store and forward, the data is either delivered
directly to the recipient MCData user or stored in the network repository and
a corresponding URL is delivered. The end-to-end transmission control process
is illustrated in figure B.1-1.
Figure B.1-1: Transmission control process
# B.2 Transmission control arbitration
The transmission control arbitration is a central function of the transmission
control process and is implementation specific. In a typical deployment,
multiple or simultaneous requests can be received at the transmission control
arbitration function. Each of these requests may be categorized into different
request types with different queuing priorities, and therefore each request
type will be maintained with separate queues. Each request shall not be
present in more than one queue at any given time. The queue types and the
order of queues may be configured by the MCData administrator, as described
below.
\- Transmission control queue: It is the primary queue from which the request
is processed for transmission e.g. emergency communication requests may result
in this queue and processed at the highest priority.
\- Communication type queue: This queue may be sorted in the order of the
communication type associated with the request. For example, the group
communication requests may always take precedence over one-to-many or private
communication requests.
\- Static attribute queue: This queue may be formed based on the static
attributes associated with the request e.g. group priority, user priority,
which may be pre-configured by the MCData administrator.
\- Dynamic attribute queue: This queue may be formed based on the dynamic
attributes associated with the request e.g. location of the sending user,
content size, etc.
###### ## Annex C: Void
###### ## Annex D (informative): Example of a User Message Storage Area
The figure in subclause 7.13.1 illustrates the high-level structure of the
MCData message store where objects are stored in a flat structure in the user
storage area. This flat data structure provides maximum flexibility for UI
implementation to present stored objects to the user. However, a folder
hierarchy structure provides a better visual presentation of the stored
objects to the MCData user.
Figure D-1: User message storage area example
In figure D-1 the MCData user 1 message storage area in the MCData message
store is constructed in folder hierarchical way. A system default folder,
Inbox, is configured to receive all new objects coming from active
communications. The MCData user 1 creates Group 1, Group 2 and Group N folders
to store communication history for different group communications that he is a
member of. Once the Group 1 folder is created the MCData user 1 can then move
all the objects related to Group 1 communication from the Inbox to the Group 1
folder. The MCData user 1 can also create child folders in Group 1 folder to
further divide the stored objects into different groupings such as with
different subjects, Subject 1 and Subject 2. Similarly, the MCData user 1
creates child folders, Date 1 and Date 2, in Group N folder to store
communication history in group N occurred in different dates. With this
hierarchical folder structure, the MCData user 1 can browse his user account
in the MCData message store interactively and navigate to the information he
would like to see. For example, the MCData user 1 can start with the top-level
root folder and traverse down the folder hierarchy to reach to Date 2 folder
and see the communication history of group N in that particular date.
