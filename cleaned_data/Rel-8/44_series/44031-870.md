# 2 Functionality of Protocol
## 2.1 General
The present document defines one generic RRLP message that is used to transfer
Location Services (LCS) related information between the Mobile Station (MS)
and the Serving Mobile Location Centre (SMLC). Usage of the RRLP protocol on a
general level is described in 3GPP TS 43.059 that includes Stage 2 description
of LCS.
One message includes one of the following components:
\- Measure Position Request;
\- Measure Position Response;
\- Assistance Data;
\- Assistance Data Acknowledgement;
\- Protocol Error;
\- Positioning Capability Request;
\- Positioning Capability Response.
Next sub-clauses describe the usage of these components.
Delivery of components may be supported in the RRLP level using pseudo-
segmentation by sending several shorter messages instead of one long message.
Any assistance data that is successfully delivered to an MS and acknowledged
prior to the interruption of the positioning procedure by an event like
handover, or by any other event that causes an MS to terminate the positioning
procedure or delivery of assistance data (see 3GPP TS 43.059), shall be
retained by the MS and need not be resent by the SMLC when positioning or
delivery of assistance data is again re-attempted.
The RRLP maximum PDU size is 242 octets. If the amount of data that needs to
be sent is larger than RRLP maximum PDU size, the RRLP pseudo-segmentation
shall be used. The RRLP pseudo-segmentation is the use of several RRLP
components (one in each RRLP message) to deliver a large amount of
information. For SMLC to MS messages, the Assistance Data component is the one
that is sent several times in order to deliver the information. For MS to SMLC
messages, the Measure Position Response component may be sent twice in order
to deliver the information. Legacy MS and SMLC (3GPP Rel-4 or older) may send
RRLP components that are larger than the RRLP maximum PDU size. In this case
lower level segmentation will be used.
## 2.2 Position Measurement Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to request for position
measurement data or location estimate from the MS, and the MS to respond to
the request with measurements or location estimate.
Figure 2.1: Position Measurement procedure
1\. The Measure Position Request component and any Assistance Data Delivery
Procedure may be preceded by a Positioning Capability Transfer procedure (see
sub-clause 2.3a) to transfer the MS positioning capabilities to the SMLC.
2\. The Measure Position Request component may be preceded by an Assistance
Data Delivery Procedure (see sub-clause 2.3) to deliver some or all of the
entire set of assistance data that is needed by the subsequent positioning
procedure (steps 3-5).
3\. The SMLC sends the Measure Position Request component in a RRLP message to
the MS. The component includes QoS, other instructions, and possible
assistance data to the MS. The RRLP message contains a reference number and an
extended reference ID of the request.
4\. The MS sends a RRLP message containing the Protocol Error component to the
SMLC, if there is a problem that prevents the MS to receive a complete and
understandable Measure Position Request component. The RRLP message contains
the reference number and, if available, the extended reference ID included in
the Measure Position Request received incomplete. The Protocol Error component
includes a more specific reason. When the SMLC receives the Protocol Error
component, it may try to resend the Measure Position Request (go back to the
step 3), abort location, or start a new position measurement procedure (e.g.
with updated assistance data).
5\. The MS tries to perform the requested location measurements, and possibly
calculates it own position. When the MS has location measurements, location
estimate, or an error indication (measurements/location estimation not
possible), it sends the results in the Measure Position Response component to
the SMLC. The RRLP message contains the reference number and, if received, the
extended reference ID of the request originally received in the step 3. The MS
may optionally send one additional Measure Position Response component in a
second RRLP message to the SMLC if the amount of information it needs to
transfer to the SMLC is too large to fit into one single Measure Position
Response component (uplink RRLP pseudo-segmentation). This RRLP message also
contains the reference number and, if received, the extended reference ID of
the request originally received in the step 3. If two components are sent, the
MS shall indicate in the first component that it is the first of many
components and in the second one that it is the second of many components. If
there is a problem that prevents the SMLC to receive a complete and
understandable Measure Position Response component, the SMLC may decide to
abort location, or start a new position measurement procedure instead. If
additional Measure Position Response components are received by the SMLC after
the 1^st^ and optional 2^nd^ one, they shall be ignored.
## 2.3 Assistance Data Delivery Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to send assistance data to
the MS related to position measurement and/or location calculation. Notice
that RRLP protocol is not used by the MS to request assistance data, only to
deliver it to the MS. The entire set of assistance data (i.e. the total amount
of assistance data that the SMLC has decided to send in the current procedure)
may be delivered in one or several Assistance Data components. In this case
steps 1 and 3 below may be repeated several times by the SMLC. If several
components are sent, the SMLC shall await the acknowledgement of each
component before the next Assistance Data component is sent. If Assistance
Data Delivery is used as part of the Position Measurement Procedure, as
described in sub-clause 2.2, then some assistance data may be delivered in the
final RRLP Measure Position Request.
Figure 2.2: Assistance Data Delivery procedure
1\. The SMLC sends the Assistance Data component to the MS. The component
includes assistance data for location measurement and/or location calculation.
The RRLP message contains a reference number and an extended reference ID of
the delivery. The More Assistance Data To Be Sent Element in the Assistance
Data component is used by the SMLC to indicate to the MS if either more
Assistance Data components (in the current Assistance Data Delivery procedure)
or a final RRLP Measure Position Request (if the Assistance Data Delivery
Procedure forms part of a Position Measurement procedure as described in sub-
clause 2.2) will be sent.
2\. The MS sends a RRLP message containing the Protocol Error component to the
SMLC, if there is a problem that prevents the MS to receive a complete and
understandable Assistance Data component. The RRLP message contains the
reference number and, if available, the extended reference ID included in the
Assistance Data component received incomplete. The Protocol Error component
includes a more specific reason. When the SMLC receives the Protocol Error
component, it may try to resend the Assistance Data component (go back to the
step 1), send a new measure Assistance Data set (e.g. with updated assistance
data), or abort the delivery.
3\. When the MS has received a complete Assistance Data component, it send the
Assistance Data Acknowledgement component to the SMLC. The RRLP message
contains the reference number of the Assistance Data originally received in
step 1.
## 2.3a Positioning Capability Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to obtain the positioning
capabilities of the MS, the types of assistance supported and the types of
assistance data that may be needed from the SMLC. MS support for this
procedure can be indicated to the SMLC using the MS Classmark 3 IE for GSM
(see 3GPP TS 24.008), the PS LCS Capability IE for GERAN Gb mode (see 3GPP TS
24.008) and the MS Positioning Capability IE for GERAN Iu mode (see 3GPP TS
44.118).
Figure 2.3: Positioning Capability Transfer procedure
1\. The SMLC sends the Positioning Capability Request component to the MS. The
RRLP message contains a reference number and an extended reference ID of the
request. The message may contain indication of GANSS positioning support.
2\. The MS sends a RRLP message containing the Protocol Error component to the
SMLC, if there is a problem that prevents the MS to receive a complete and
understandable Positioning Capability Request component. The RRLP message
contains the reference number and the extended reference ID included in the
Positioning Capability Request component. The Protocol Error component
includes a more specific reason. When the SMLC receives the Protocol Error
component, it may try to resend the Positioning Capability Request component
(go back to the step 1) or abort the request.
3\. When the MS has received a complete Positioning Capability Request
component, it sends the Positioning Capability Response component to the SMLC.
The component shall include the positioning capabilities of the MS and the
types of supported assistance data. The component may include the types of
assistance needed by the MS to obtain a location estimate or positioning
measurements. The RRLP message also contains the reference number and extended
Reference ID of the Positioning Capability Request originally received in step
1.
## 2.4 (void)
## 2.5 Error Handling Procedures
### 2.5.1 General
In this sub-clause it is described how a receiving entity behaves in cases
when it receives erroneous data or detects that certain data is missing.
### 2.5.1a Message Too Short
When MS receives a RRLP message, that is too short to contain all mandatory
IEs, the MS sends a Protocol Error component with indication \"Message Too
Short\". If the Reference Number can be found, it is included. If the
Reference Number is not available, the Reference Number of the RRLP message
carrying the Protocol Error component is set to \'0\'. If the Extended
Reference IE can be found, it shall be included in the returned Protocol Error
Component. If the Extended Reference IE is not available, an Extended
Reference IE shall not be included. The original sending entity that receives
the Protocol Error, may then resend the original message, or abort the
procedure.
### 2.5.2 Unknown Reference Number
A SMLC detects that it has received a RRLP message with an unknown or invalid
Reference Number, when one or more of the following conditions occur:
\- a Measure Position Response, Assistance Data Acknowledgement, Positioning
Capability Response or Protocol Error component is received with a Reference
Number that the SMLC has not sent in a Measure Position Request, Assistance
Data or Positioning Capability Request component during a pending Position
Measurement, Assistance Data Delivery or Positioning Capability Transfer
procedure.
\- a Measure Position Response, Positioning Capability Response or Protocol
Error component is received with an Extended Reference IE value that the SMLC
has not sent in a Measure Position Request, Assistance Data or Positioning
Capability Request component during a pending Position Measurement, Assistance
Data Delivery or Positioning Capability Transfer procedure.
\- a Measure Position Response, Positioning Capability Response or Protocol
Error component is received with a Reference Number and an Extended Reference
IE value that the SMLC has not sent together in the same Measure Position
Request, the same Assistance Data or the same Positioning Capability Request
component during a pending Position Measurement, Assistance Data Delivery or
Positioning Capability Transfer procedure.
The SMLC shall then discard the message. If the SMLC receives a Measure
Position Response or a Protocol Error component containing no Extended
Reference ID, then the SMLC shall assume that the target MS is for Release 4
or earlier and shall only verify the received Reference Number.
### 2.5.3 Missing Information Element or Component Element
When MS receives a RRLP message, that does not contain IEs or component
elements expected to be present, the MS sends a Protocol Error component with
indication \"Missing Information Element or Component Element\". If the
Reference Number can be found, it is included. If the Reference Number is not
available, the Reference Number of the RRLP message carrying the Protocol
Error component is set to \'0\'. If the Extended Reference IE can be found, it
shall be included in the returned Protocol Error Component. If the Extended
Reference IE is not available, an Extended Reference IE shall not be included.
The SMLC that receives the Protocol Error, may then resend the original
message, or abort the procedure.
### 2.5.4 Incorrect Data
When MS receives a RRLP message, that is contains IEs or elements of
components that are syntactically incorrect, the MS sends a Protocol Error
component with indication \"Incorrect Data\". If the Reference Number can be
found, it is included. If the Reference Number is not available, the Reference
Number of the RRLP message carrying the Protocol Error component is set to
\'0\'. If the Extended Reference IE can be found, it shall be included in the
returned Protocol Error Component. If the Extended Reference IE is not
available, an Extended Reference IE shall not be included. The SMLC that
receives the Protocol Error, may then resend the original message, or abort
the procedure.
### 2.5.5 Repeated Component
When after the reception of a Measure Position Request component, but before
responding with a Measure Position Response or a Protocol Error component, the
MS receives a new RRLP message with the Measure Position Request component, it
acts as follows:
\- if the old and new Measure Position Request components have the same
Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE, the MS
ignores the later component;
\- if the old and new Measure Position Request components have different
Reference Numbers or, if included, different Extended Reference IEs or if one
Measure Position Request component (old or new) contains an Extended Reference
IE but the other component does not, the MS aborts activity for the former
component, and starts to acts according to the later component, and sends a
response to that.
When after the reception of an Assistance Data component, but before
responding with an Assistance Data Acknowledgement or a Protocol Error
component, the MS receives a new RRLP message with the Assistance Data
component, it acts as follows:
\- if the old and new Assistance Data components have the same Reference
Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE and if pseudo-
segmentation does not apply (see sub-clause 2.5.9), the MS ignores the later
component;
\- if the old and new Assistance Data components have different Reference
Numbers or, if included, different Extended Reference IEs or if one Assistance
Data component (old or new) contains an Extended Reference IE but the other
component does not, the MS ignores the former component and sends an
acknowledgement to the latter component.
When after the reception of a Positioning Capability Request component, but
before responding with a Positioning Capability Response or a Protocol Error
component, the MS receives a new RRLP message with the Positioning Capability
Request component, it acts as follows:
\- if the old and new Positioning Capability Request components have the same
Reference Number and the same Extended Reference IE, the MS ignores the later
component;
\- if the old and new Positioning Capability Request components have different
Reference Numbers or different Extended Reference IEs, the MS aborts activity
for the former component, starts to act according to the later component and
sends a response to that.When after the reception of a Measure Position
Response component, the SMLC receives a new RRLP message with the Measure
Position Response component, it acts as follows:
\- if the old and new Measure Position Response components have the same
Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE values, the
SMLC may ignore the later component.
### 2.5.6 (void)
### 2.5.7 Missing Component
When the SMLC sends a Measure Position Request component to the MS, it starts
a timer. If the timer expires before the SMLC receives the last Measure
Position Response component or a Protocol Error component from the MS with the
same Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE value
as in the sent component, it may abort location attempt or send a new Measure
Position Request.
When the SMLC receives a Measure Position Response component with the same
Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE value as in
the sent component indicating that it is the second of many segments, but the
first of the many segments was never received by the SMLC, it may abort
location attempt or send a new Measure Position Request.
When the SMLC sends a Assistance Data component to the MS, it starts a timer.
If the timer expires before the SMLC receives a Assistance Data
Acknowledgement or Protocol Error component from the MS with the same
Reference Number as in the sent component and, in the case of a Protocol Error
component, either the same extended reference ID as in the sent component or
no extended reference ID, it may abort delivery attempt or send a new
Assistance Data.
When the SMLC sends a Positioning Capability Request component to the MS, it
starts a timer. If the timer expires before the SMLC receives a Positioning
Capability Response or Protocol Error component from the MS with the same
Reference Number and the same Extended Reference ID as in the sent component,
it may abort the Positioning Capability Transfer Procedure attempt or send a
new Positioning Capability Request.
### 2.5.8 Unforeseen Component
When the MS receives a complete Assistance Data pseudo-segmentation sequence
or an Assistance Data component that was sent without pseudo-segmentation,
that it is not expecting, MS may discard it.
### 2.5.8a RRLP Procedure
The MS and SMLC shall only support one RRLP procedure at a time for either
positioning, delivery of assistance data or positioning capability transfer.
The normal sequence of events for either procedure is defined in sub-clause
2.2, sub-clause 2.3 or sub-clause2.3a, respectively. If the MS is engaged in
an RRLP procedure and receives a correctly encoded RRLP message from the SMLC
that starts a new procedure, the MS shall abort the first procedure without
sending a response and start the second.
### 2.5.9 Pseudo-Segmentation
When the SMLC employs pseudo-segmentation to send an RRLP Measure Position
Request message or an RRLP Assistance Data message, the SMLC shall send one or
more RRLP Assistance Data components followed by:
\- a final RRLP Measure Position Request component (see sub-clause 2.2) or
\- a final RRLP Assistance Data component (see sub-clause 2.3).
The SMLC shall indicate in all but the final component (Measure Position
Request or Assistance Data, respectively) that more components are on the way.
When an MS receives an Assistance Data component indicating that more
components are on the way, the MS may store the contents of the component. If
the MS receives a subsequent Assistance Data component or a final Measure
Position Request component that is correctly encoded, the MS shall assume that
the new component continues the pseudo-segmentation of the earlier component
and may then store the contents of the new component. If the new component is
an Assistance Data component indicating that no more components are on the way
or if it is a Measure Position Request, the MS shall assume that pseudo-
segmentation is complete. The MS may then employ the rules defined in sub-
clause 2.5.5 to verify if the new message is a repeated duplicate of a
previous message.
# 3 Message Structure
## 3.1 General Format of RRLP Message
The general format of the RRLP message is given below, and based on:
\- ITU-T Recommendation X.680;
\- ITU-T Recommendation X.691;
and is consistent with these ITU-T recommendations. Also further definitions
in the present document are based on ASN.1/94 defined in ITU-T Recommendation
X.680 (ASN.1 1994). BASIC-PER, unaligned variant is used. Both RRLP ASN.1
modules, RRLP-Messages and RRLP-Components, are based on recommendations
presented above.
ASN.1 identifiers have the same name as the corresponding parameters
(information elements of the RRLP message, components, elements of components,
fields of component elements etc) in other parts of the present document,
except for the differences required by the ASN.1 notation (blanks between
words are removed, the first letter of the first word is lower-case and the
first letter of the following words are capitalized, e.g. \"Reference Number\"
is mapped to \"referenceNumber\"). In addition some words may be abbreviated
as follows:
msr measure
req request
rsp response
nbr number
ack acknowledgement
Ellipsis Notation shall be used in the same way as described in 3GPP TS 29.002
and shall be supported on the radio interface by the MS and the network for
all operations defined in the present document.

+-----------------------------------------------------+ | RRLP-Messages | | | | -- { RRLP-messages } | | | | DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::= | | | | BEGIN | | | | IMPORTS | | | | MsrPosition-Req, MsrPosition-Rsp, AssistanceData, | | | | ProtocolError, PosCapability-Req, PosCapability-Rsp | | | | FROM | | | | RRLP-Components -- { RRLP-Components } | | | | ; | | | | PDU ::= SEQUENCE { | | | | referenceNumber INTEGER (0..7), | | | | component RRLP-Component | | | | } | | | | RRLP-Component ::= CHOICE { | | | | msrPositionReq MsrPosition-Req, | | | | msrPositionRsp MsrPosition-Rsp, | | | | assistanceData AssistanceData, | | | | assistanceDataAck NULL, | | | | protocolError ProtocolError, | | | | ..., | | | | posCapabilityReq PosCapability-Req, | | | | posCapabilityRsp PosCapability-Rsp | | | | } | | | | END | +-----------------------------------------------------+
The message consists of two information elements, that are further described
in the following sub-clauses.
## 3.2 Reference Number IE
This element is mandatory, and appears only once per RRLP message. It has the
range from 0 to 7. Value 0 is reserved for indicating unknown Reference
Number. Its ASN.1 definition is in sub-clause 3.1. This element contains the
Reference Number that shall be used as follows:
\- in the Position Measurement procedure the SMLC shall select any number
within the range 1- 7 that it is not already using with the particular MS. The
Reference Number serves as an identification of the Measure Position request
component that it sends to the MS. When the MS responds either with the
Measure Position Response component, or the Protocol Error component, it shall
use the same Reference Number value and, if an Extended Reference ID was
included by the SMLC, the same Extended Reference ID to identify to which
Measure Position Request it is responding, if the Reference Number has been
obtained. If the MS has not been able to decode the Reference Number (e.g. IE
missing), it shall use \'0\' as the Reference number in the response. This
mechanism helps for example in the cases where the SMLC sends a Measure
Position Request to the MS, and before it receives the Response, it needs to
send another Request (e.g. assistance data changes). Then the SMLC can
identify to which Request the Response is related to;
\- in the Assistance Data Delivery procedure the SMLC shall select any number
within the range 1 - 7 that it is not already using with the MS. The Reference
Number serves as an identification of the Assistance Data component that it
sends to the MS. When the MS responds either with the Assistance Data
Acknowledgement component or the Protocol Error component, it shall use the
same Reference Number value if the Reference Number has been obtained and, in
the case of Protocol Error, if an Extended Reference ID was included by the
SMLC, the same Extended Reference ID to identify to which Assistance Data
component it is responding,. If the MS has not been able to decode the
Reference Number (e.g. IE missing), it shall use \'0\' as the Reference number
in the response.
\- in the Position Capability Transfer procedure the SMLC shall select any
number within the range 1 - 7 that it is not already using with the MS. The
Reference Number serves as an identification of the Positioning Capability
Request component that it sends to the MS. When the MS responds either with
the Positioning Capability Response component, or the Protocol Error
component, it shall use the same Reference Number value if the Reference
Number has been obtained and the same Extended Reference ID value if that has
been obtained to identify to which Positioning Capability Request component it
is responding. If the MS has not been able to decode the Reference Number
(e.g. IE missing), it shall use \'0\' as the Reference number in the response.
> \- the SMLC shall use the same Reference Number and same Extended Reference
> ID to resend any RRLP component for which a response was not received from
> the MS.
>
> \- the SMLC shall use a different Reference Number to that in any RRLP
> component for which a response was not received from the MS if the SMLC
> aborts an existing RRLP procedure and starts a new procedure.
>
> \- the SMLC may use the same Reference Number and same Extended Reference ID
> or different Reference Numbers and Extended Reference IDs for different RRLP
> components within the same pseudo-segmentation sequence.
In all RRLP messages except Assistance Data Acknowledgement, the Reference
Number IE shall be supplemented by an Extended Reference IE in order to
distinguish valid from invalid RRLP responses at the SMLC and duplicate from
non-duplicate RRLP commands at the MS. In order to remain backward compatible,
the receiving entity shall be able to receive Measure Position Request,
Measure Position Response, Assistance Data and Protocol Error messages without
the Extended Reference IE. The ASN.1 definition of the Extended Reference IE
is given in sub-clause 5.1 and the procedures associated with sending and
receiving it are given in clause 2 and in Annex A, sub-clauses A.2.2.5,
A.3.2.7 and A.6.6.
## 3.3 Component IE
This element is mandatory, and appears only once per RRLP message. It contains
the actual component to be transferred.
Different components are described further in Chapter 4. This IE contains only
one component, i.e. it is not possible to include two or more components.
# 4 Components
This ASN.1 module contains the definitions of the components and datatypes
defined in the components.

## 4.1 Measure Position Request
This component is used by the SMLC to request location measurements or a
location estimate from the MS. It includes QoS, other instructions, and

# 6 TOM Protocol Header for RRLP Transport
## 6.1 General
For the specification of the TOM protocol, see 3GPP TS 44.064.
## 6.2 Remaining Octets of TOM Protocol Header for RRLP
The number of remaining octet following the first octets of the TOM protocol
header for RRLP is one. The encoding of this octet is defined in the figure
6.1 and the table 6.1.
Figure 6.1: Remaining Octets of TOM Protocol Header for RRLP
Table 6.1: C/R bit content
* * *
C/R UI frame information field 0 Command (SMLC to MS) or Final Response (MS to
SMLC) 1 Not Command or Final Response
* * *
The setting of the C/R flag is provided by the sending RRLP entity, for
further details see 3GPP TS 43.059.
The Spare bits shall be ignored by the receiver and set to 0 by the sender. If
a protocol header with more than one remaining octet of the TOM protocol
header is received, the additional octets after the first remaining octet
shall be ignored by the receiver.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Description of Components
## A.1 Introduction
This annex describes the contents of components.
## A.2 Measure Position Request
### A.2.1 General
The Measure Position Request is a RRLP component from the SMLC to the MS. This
component is common to E-OTD,GPS and GANSS (Galileo and Additional Navigation
Satellite Systems) location methods. As a response to this component, the MS
performs E-OTD,GPS or GANSS measurements and possibly calculates its own
position, if the MS and/or the network support these options. It contains the
following elements.

### A.2.2 Elements
#### A.2.2.1 Positioning Instructions Element
The purpose of Positioning Instructions element is to express the
allowed/required location method(s), and to provide information required QoS.
This element is mandatory in the Measure Position Request message, and
contains the following fields:
**Method Type**
This field indicates whether MS based or assisted version is
allowed/requested. If the Positioning Methods field includes more than one
method, the Method Type applies to all of them. This field is mandatory, and
has the following values:
\'0\': MS assisted;
\'1\': MS based;
\'2\': MS based is preferred, but MS assisted is allowed;
\'3\': MS assisted is preferred, but MS based is allowed.
In GPS positioning methods, 'MS based' may indicate either MS Based Assisted
GPS method or Conventional GPS method. If 'MS based is indicated with no GPS
assistance data then the MS may interpret this as either Conventional GPS or
MS based A-GPS without assistance data. The same interpretation applies also
to the GANSS positioning method.
**Positioning Methods**
This field indicates which location method or methods should be used. This
field is mandatory.
\'0\': E-OTD;
\'1\': GPS;
\'2\': E-OTD or GPS (i.e. both can be reported).
NOTE: If the selected positioning method is 'GPS' or 'E-OTD or GPS', the field
GANSS Positioning Method, if present in a Measure Position Request component,
indicates request of GANSS method and indicates the allowed satellite systems.
**Response Time**
This field indicates the desired response time. However, when performing
measurements, the desired response time may be exceeded. This field is
mandatory.
The response time is 2^N^ seconds, where N is the value in this field. Thus
the desired maximum response time can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128
seconds.
Range: 0-7
**Accuracy**
This field indicates the required accuracy of the location estimate. This is
field is mandatory when Method Type is \'1\', \'2\', or \'3\' and optional
when Method Type is \'0\'.
This field is 7 bit Uncertainty Code as defined in 3GPP TS 23.032.
**Multiple Sets**
This field indicates whether MS is requested to send multiple _E-OTD/GPS/GANSS
Measurement Information Sets_. The maximum number of measurement sets is
three. This is field is mandatory. MS is expected to include the current
measurement set. Additionally MS may include historical measurement sets, or
measure new additional sets if the response time allows that.
\'0\': multiple IEs can be send;
\'1\': sending of multiple sets is not allowed.
**Environment Characterization**
Environment Characterization field provides the MS with information about
expected multipath and NLOS in the current area. This field is optional.
\'0\': possibly heavy multipath and NLOS conditions (e.g. bad urban or urban).
\'1\': no or light multipath and usually LOS conditions (e.g. suburban or
rural).
\'2\': not defined or mixed environment.
\'3\': reserved for future use.
#### A.2.2.1a GANSS Positioning Method Element
This bit map indicates the satellite systems allowed by the SMLC corresponding
to allowance of 'GPS' in the Positioning Methods field. Each bit is of type
Boolean, where TRUE ('1') means the particular satellite system is allowed.
For example EOTD + Galileo method can be indicated by setting 'E-OTD or GPS'
in Positioning Methods and setting only the 'bit 1' to TRUE value in the GANSS
Positioning Method element. The MS shall not request assistance data or report
measurements for the systems that are not indicated in the bit map.
NOTE: Bit 0 of this bit map shall not be the only one set to TRUE ('1').
\'bit 0\': GPS;
\'bit 1\': Galileo;
'bit 2': SBAS (WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, GAGAN);
'bit 3': Modernized GPS (L1C, L2C, L5);
'bit 4': QZSS;
'bit 5': GLONASS;
\'bit 6-15\': Reserved for future GNSSes.
#### A.2.2.2 E-OTD Reference BTS for Assistance Data Element
The RTD and 51 multiframe offset values in the E-OTD Measurement Assistance
Data element and the E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data for System Information
List element are calculated relative to the BTS indicated in this element.
Also the E-OTD Measurement Assistance data for System Information List
element, if present, refers to the System Information Neighbor List of this
reference BTS.
Inclusion of this parameter is mandatory for E-OTD since it is not possible to
reliably default to the current serving BTS for the target MS, as there is a
small chance that the SMLC does not know this. If the E-OTD Measurement
Assistance data for System Information List element is present, the current
serving cell must be the same as reference BTS identified in this element.
**BCCH Carrier**
This field indicates the absolute RF channel number of BCCH of the reference
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 1023
**BSIC**
This field indicates the BSIC (Base Station Identity Code) of the reference
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 63
**Time Slot Scheme**
The Time Slot Scheme field indicates the type of transmission scheme the
reference BTS is using. If the MS measures BTSs signals from time slots other
than 0 or 4, and it is informed about the burst length schemes used by BTSs,
then it can compensate for the possible error. (This is necessary if the MS
averages bursts from different time slots, and the BTS uses varying lengths of
bursts.) This field is mandatory.
\'0\' = all time slots are 156.25 bits long.
\'1\' = time slots 0 and 4 are 157 bits long and other time slots are 156 bits
long.
**BTS Position**
This field contains the BTS position in the format defined in 3GPP TS 23.032.
This field is optional, but should be present for MS based E-OTD positioning.
The allowed shapes are:
\- ellipsoid point;
\- ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid.
#### A.2.2.3 E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data Element
This element identifies BTSs that are used for E-OTD measurements. This
element helps the MS to make measurements from neighbor BTS (even below
decoding level). This element is optional in the Measure Position Request
component. The presence of this element means that the MS should try to
measure the E-OTD values between the reference BTS and the BTSs identified in
this element.
This element is used to deliver E-OTD measurement assistance data for those
BTSs, that are not included in the System Information Neighbor List of the
reference BTS, if necessary.
The RTD and 51 multiframe offset values are calculated relative to the BTS
indicated in the E-OTD Reference BTS for Assistance Data element. This element
contains the following fields.
**Number of BTSs**
This field indicates how many BTSs are included in this IE. This field is
mandatory. The maximum number of BTSs in this message for whom the assistance
data can be given is 16 (reference BTS and 15 neigbour BTSs). Thus the sum of
**Number of BTSs** field in this IE and total amount of **E-OTD Neighbor
present** bits with value \'1\' in **E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data for
System Information List IE** can be at a maximum 15.
Range: 1 to 15.
The following fields are repeated for the number of BTSs included in the
Number of BTSs field.
**BCCH Carrier**
This field indicates the absolute RF channel number of BCCH of the particular
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 1023
**BSIC**
This field indicates the BSIC (Base Station Identity Code) of the particular
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 63
**Multiframe Offset**
This field indicates the frame difference between the start of the 51
multiframes frames being transmitted from this BTS and the reference BTS. The
multiframe offset is defined as T~BTS~ - T~Ref~, where T~BTS~ is the time of
the start of the 51 multiframe in the BTS in question, and T~Ref~ is the time
of the start of the 51 multiframe in the reference BTS. This field is
mandatory. Multiframe Offset may be used to calculate the Expected Multiframe
Offset (the Multiframe Offset value that MS is expected to measure between
this BTS and reference BTS in its current estimated location).
Expected Multiframe Offset = (Multiframe Offset + Adjustment) modulo 51
Adjustment = 1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD >= 850
Adjustment = -1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD =\ 30 bit.
NOTE: If uncertainty in MS\'s location is x bits, uncertainty in Expected OTD
is 2*x (in the worst case). When the uncertainty is given with value '7' no
upper bound exist for the uncertainty.
The following fields tell the coordinates of neighbor BTSs that are used for
E-OTD measurements, and also fine RTD values. This information allows the MS
to calculate its own location. These fields (Fine RTD, Relative north,
Relative east and Relative altitude) are optional. All of Fine RTD, Relative
north, and Relative east fields must be present, if some of them is included.
**Fine RTD**
This field indicates the fine RTD value between this BTS and reference BTS. It
provides the 1/256 bit duration resolution to the value expressed in the
corresponding Rough RTD field. This RTD value is the RTD value of TS0s (i.e.
the difference in starting of TS0), not only the RTD between starts of bursts.
The RTD is defined as T~BTS~ - T~Ref~, where T~BTS~ is the time of the start
of TS0 in the BTS in question, and T~Ref~ is the time of the start of the TS0
in the reference BTS. This field is optional.
Range: 0 - 255
**Relative North**
This field indicates the distance of the neighbor BTS from the reference BTS
in north- (negative values mean south) direction. This field is optional. The
units are 0.03 seconds. The used reference ellipsoid is WGS 84 ellipsoid.
Range: -200000...200000
**Relative East**
This field indicates the distance of the neighbor BTS from the reference BTS
in east (negative values mean west) direction. This field is optional. The
units are 0.03 seconds. The used reference ellipsoid is WGS 84 ellipsoid.
Range: -200000 ... 200000
**Relative Altitude**
This field indicates the altitude of the neighbor BTS relative to the
reference BTS in meters. This field is optional.
Range: -4000 .. 4000 meters
#### A.2.2.4 E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data for System Information List
Element
This element identifies those BTSs in the System Information Neighbor List
that are used for E-OTD measurements. The System Information Neighbor Lists,
to which this assistance data is given, are System Information Neighbor Lists
that are sent in the dedicated mode, packet idle mode, packet transfer mode,
or dual transfer mode. This element helps the MS to make measurements from
those neighbor BTS (even below decoding level). This element is optional in
the Measure Position Request component. The presence of this element means
that the MS should use the BTSs identified here to the E-OTD measurements.
The RTD and 51 multiframe offset values are calculated relative to the
reference BTS. This element contains the following fields.
**Number of Neighbors**
This field indicates how many neighbors are included in this IE.
Range: 1-32
The following fields are repeated for the number indicated in the Number of
Neighbors field.
**E-OTD Neighbor present**
This field indicates whether the information concerning a certain BTS in the
Neighbor List is present. Altogether no more than 15 BTS can have the
indication \"Neighbor is included\". The maximum number of BTSs in this
message for whom the assistance data can be given is 16 (reference BTS and 15
neigbour BTSs). Thus the sum of total amount of **E-OTD Neighbor present**
bits with value \'1\' in this IE and **Number of BTSs** field in **E-OTD
Measurement Assistance Data IE** can be at a maximum 15.
\'0\' Neighbor not included;
\'1\' Neighbor is included.
The following fields (BSIC, Multiframe Offset, Time Slot Sscheme and Rough
RTD) are included if E-OTD neighbor present field is set to \'1\'.
**BSIC**
This field indicates the BSIC (Base Station Identity Code) of the particular
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 63
**Multiframe Offset**
This field indicates the frame difference between the start of the 51
multiframes frames being transmitted from this BTS and the reference BTS. The
multiframe offset is defined as T~BTS~ - T~Ref~, where T~BTS~ is the time of
the start of the 51 multiframe in the BTS in question, and T~Ref~ is the time
of the start of the 51 multiframe in the reference BTS. This field is
mandatory. Multiframe Offset may be used to calculate the Expected Multiframe
Offset (the Multiframe Offset value that MS is expected to measure between
this BTS and reference BTS in its current estimated location).
Expected Multiframe Offset = (Multiframe Offset + Adjustment) modulo 51
Adjustment = 1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD >= 850
Adjustment = -1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD =\ 30 bit.
NOTE: If uncertainty in MS\'s location is x bits, uncertainty in Expected OTD
is 2*x (in the worst case). When the uncertainty is given with value '7' no
upper bound exist for the uncertainty.
The following fields tell the coordinates of neighbor BTSs that are used for
E-OTD measurements, and also fine RTD values. This information allows the MS
to calculate its own location. These fields (Fine RTD, Relative north,
Relative east and Relative altitude) are optional. All of Fine RTD, Relative
north, and Relative east fields must be present, if some of them is included.
**Fine RTD**
This field indicates the fine RTD value between this BTS and reference BTS. It
provides the 1/256 bit duration resolution to the value expressed in the
corresponding Rough RTD field. This RTD value is the RTD value of TS0s (i.e.
the difference in starting of TS0), not only the RTD between starts of bursts.
The RTD is defined as T~BTS~ - T~Ref~, where T~BTS~ is the time of the start
of TS0 in the BTS in question, and T~Ref~ is the time of the start of the TS0
in the reference BTS. This field is optional.
Range: 0 - 255

**Relative East**
This field indicates the distance of the neighbor BTS from the reference BTS
in east (negative values mean west) direction. This field is optional. The
units are 0.03 seconds. The used reference ellipsoid is WGS 84 ellipsoid.
Range: -200000 ... 200000
**Relative Altitude**
This field indicates the altitude of the neighbor BTS relative to the
reference BTS in meters. This field is optional.
Range: -4000 .. 4000 meters
#### A.2.2.4a GPS Time Assistance Measurement Request element
This component does not have any information contents. If this component is
present, the MS is requested to return GPS time assistance measurements.
#### A.2.2.4b GPS Reference Time Uncertainty element
This element provides the accuracy of the relation GPS and GSM time in the
Reference Time field in GPS Assistance Data IE. If GPS TOW is the given GPS
time, then the true GPS time, corresponding to the provided GSM time as
observed at the MS location, lies in the interval (GPS TOW - GPS Reference
Time Uncertainty, GPS TOW + GPS Reference Time Uncertainty). An entity that
supports this element shall always include it when appropriate. This means
that when the element is expected but is not received, lack of support at the
sender can be assumed and some implementation dependent default interpretation
can then be applied.
The uncertainty _r_ , expressed in microseconds, is mapped to a number K, with
the following formula:
_r_ = C*(((1+x)^K^)-1)
with C = 0.0022 and x = 0.18. With 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 127, a suitably useful range
between 0 and 3 second is achieved for the uncertainty, while still being able
to code down to values as small as 0.3 nanoseconds. To encode any higher value
of uncertainty than that corresponding in the above formula to K=127, the same
value, K=127, shall also be used. The uncertainty is then coded on 7 bits, as
the binary encoding of K.

#### A.2.2.4c Velocity Request element
If this element is present, the MS is requested to return a velocity estimate
along with the location estimate. Requesting velocity does not guarantee its
delivery, if conditions support its availability and it is requested it will
be provided.
#### A.2.2.4d GANSS Carrier-Phase Measurement Request Element
This component does not have any information contents. If this component is
present, the MS is requested to return carrier phase measurements in the GANSS
Measurement Information IE.
#### A.2.2.4e GANSS TOD - GSM Time Association Request Element
This component does not have any information contents. If this component is
present, the MS is requested to return GANSS TOD - GSM time association
measurements. Only either GPS Timing Assistance Measurement Request Element or
GANSS TOD - GSM Time Association Measurement Request should be present in
Measure Position Request.
#### A.2.2.4f Required Response Time
This element indicates the maximum response time that shall be allowed for the
positioning request in the MS. When this element is received, the MS shall
send an RRLP Measure Position Response before the required response time has
elapsed.
When this element is received, the MS shall ignore the Response Time field in
the Positioning Instructions element.
The Required Response Time has a value from 1 to 128 seconds.
#### A.2.2.4g GANSS Multi-frequency Measurement Request Element
This component does not have any information contents.
If this component is present, the MS is requested to return measurements
performed on multiple GANSS signal types if the MS supports this capability.
If this component is not present, the MS shall report only one signal type for
each GANSS.
If SMLC has indicated supported signal types in Positioning Capability
Request, the MS shall only report signals that are supported by SMLC.
#### A.2.2.5 Extended Reference IE
This element is mandatory in any RRLP Measure Position Request component, any
RRLP Assistance Data component, any RRLP Positioning Capability Request
component and any RRLP Positioning Capability response component.
NOTE: For reasons of backward compatibility, the IE is not defined for a
Release 4 or earlier SMLC and would be ignored, when received, by a Release 4
or earlier MS. Additionally, other requirements associated with this IE would
not be supported by a Release 4 or earlier MS or SMLC.
The Extended Reference IE contains the following elements:
SMLC code: an integer in the range 0-63 distinguishing any SMLC from other
neighbour SMLCs in the same Routing Area. Each SMLC is assigned a specific
SMLC ID value. The values assigned to neighbour SMLCs in the same Routing Area
between which inter-NSE cell change is possible should be different.
Transaction ID: an integer in the range 0-262143 distinguishing different RRLP
transactions in different MSs currently being served by the same SMLC. An SMLC
shall assign a different transaction ID to each currently open RRLP
transaction for positioning and assistance data delivery among all target MSs.
When any RRLP transaction for any MS is completed in the SMLC (e.g. the MS has
sent a correctly formatted RRLP Measure Position Response or Assistance Data
Ack.) or if the transaction is aborted (e.g. SMLC timeout on an RRLP
response), the associated transaction ID value shall become free and may be
later assigned to a new RRLP transaction by the SMLC. When any transaction ID
value becomes free, an SMLC should attempt to wait for at least 128 seconds
(the maximum defined RRLP response time from an MS) before reassigning the
same value.
## A.3 Measure Position Response

the BCCH allocation list (System Information Neighbor List) of the serving BTS
.
This field is conditional and included only if CellIdType is set to \'3\'.
Range: 1-32
#### A.3.2.3 E-OTD Measurement Information Element
The purpose of the E-OTD Measurement Information element is to provide OTD
measurements of signals sent from the reference and neighbor based stations.
The length of this element depends on the number of neighbor cells for which
OTD measurements have been collected. This element is optional in the Measure
Position Response component. It is included in the Measure Position Response
component, if the network has requested the mobile to perform the MS assisted
E-OTD method. BTSs which cannot be measured or whose measurements are
excessively inaccurate need not be reported. The MS may include measurements
for other BTSs not given in the assistance data by the SMLC.
The E-OTD and 51 multiframe offset values are reported relative to the
reference BTS as defined in the previous sub-clauses.
The following fields are repeated for each measurement set.
**Reference Frame Number**
This field indicates the frame number of the last measured burst from the

the measurements. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 42431
**Reference Time Slot**
Reference Time Slot indicates the time slot modulo 4 relative to which the MS
reports the reference BTS measurements. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 to 3
NOTE 1: If MS does not know timeslot scheme, the MS reports the used timeslot.
MS can only report results based on one time slot (N) or two time slots (N and
N+4). If the MS knows the timeslot scheme, it can make measurements from
several timeslots and reports that the used timeslot is zero (and makes
correction).
**Reference Quality**
Reference Quality field includes the standard deviation of the TOA
measurements from the reference BTS with respect to T~Ref~ (where T~Ref~ is
the time of arrival of signal from the reference BTS used to calculate the OTD
values). This field is optional. The Reference Quality field can be used to
evaluate the reliability of E-OTD measurements in the SMLC and in weighting of
the E-OTD values in the location calculation.
Following linear 5 bit encoding is used:
\'00000\' 0 - (R*1-1) meters;
\'00001\' R*1 - (R*2-1) meters;
\'00010\' R*2 - (R*3-1) meters;
...
\'11111\' R*31 meters or more.
where R is the resolution defined by Std Resolution field. For example, if
R=20 meters, corresponding values are 0 - 19 meters, 20 - 39 meters, 40 - 59
meters, ..., 620+ meters.
**Number of Measurements**
Number of Measurements for the Reference Quality field is used together with
Reference Quality to define quality of the reference base site TOA. The field
indicates how many measurements have been used in the MS to define the
standard deviation of the measurements. Following 3 bit encoding is used:
\'000\': 2-4;
\'001\': 5-9;
\'010\': 10-14;

1\. There shall be no repetition of data for the same satellite.
2\. Optional and conditional elements in the parameter not associated with a
particular satellite shall each appear in at most one RRLP segment.
3\. Any mandatory element not associated with a particular satellite shall
assume consistent values in the case of an element related to current GPS time
and the same value otherwise.
4\. The maximum number of satellites defined in sub-clause 5.1 for which data
can be included for any parameter in one RRLP segment shall apply also when
counted over all RRLP segments.
**Reference** **Time**
These fields specify the relationship between GPS time and air-interface
timing of the BTS transmission in the reference cell. These fields occur once
per message; some are mandatory and some are conditional, as shown in table
A.14. Note that Reference Time may also be present within the Acquisition
Assistance parameter. In such a case, the SMLC shall ensure consistency.

**GPS Week**
This field specifies the GPS week number of the assistance being provided. GPS
Week eliminates one-week ambiguities from the time of the GPS assistance. This
field is mandatory.
**GPS** **TOW**
The GPS TOW (time-of-week) is a mandatory field and is specified with 80 msec
resolution. When GSM Time Present is \"1\", GPS TOW and BCCH/BSIC/FNm/TN/BN
IEs provide a valid relationship between GPS and GSM time, as seen at the
approximate location of the MS, ie the propagation delay from BTS to MS shall
be compensated for by the SMLC. Depending on implementation, the relation
between GPS and GSM time may have varying accuracy. Therefore, the uncertainty
of the timing relation may be provided in the optional field GPS Reference
Time Uncertainty. If the propagation delay from BTS to MS is not accurately
known, the SMLC shall use the best available approximation of the propagation
delay and take the corresponding delay uncertainty into account in the
calculation of the field GPS Reference Time Uncertainty. When GSM Time Present
is \"0\", GPS TOW is an estimate of current GPS time of week at time of
reception of the RRLP segment containing this data by the MS. The SMLC should
achieve an accuracy of +/- 3 seconds for this estimate including allowing for
the transmission delay between SMLC and MS of the RRLP segment containing GPS
TOW. Note that the MS should further compensate GPS TOW for the time between
the reception of the segment containing GPS TOW and the time when the GPS TOW
field is used.
**BCCH Carrier/BSIC/FNm/TN/BN**
These fields specify the state of the GSM frame number, timeslot number, and
bit number, respectively, of the reference BTS with the specified BCCH carrier
and BSIC at the time that correspond to GPS TOW. The SMLC shall use the
current serving BTS as the reference BTS. The frame number field is given
modulo 2^21^, i.e., the MSB of the GSM frame number is truncated. The MS shall
interpret FNm as the most recent of the two possible frame numbers that FNm
could represent. The target MS has the option of rejecting a GPS position
request or GPS assistance data if the reference BTS is not the serving BTS.
**GPS TOW Assist**
This field contains several fields in the Telemetry (TLM) Word and Handover
Word (HOW) that are currently being broadcast by the respective GPS
satellites. Combining this information with GPS TOW enables the MS to know the
entire 1.2-second (60-bit) pattern of TLM and HOW that is transmitted at the
start of each six-second subframe by the particular GPS satellite. This field
contains information for each of N_SAT satellites, and optional. The
individual fields for each satellite in the message are shown in table A.15a.

being broadcast by the GPS satellite identified by the particular SatID, with
the MSB occurring first in the satellite transmission.
**Anti-Spoof/Alert**
These fields contain the Anti-Spoof and Alert flags that are being broadcast
by the GPS satellite identified by SatID.
**TLM Reserved**
These fields contain the two reserved bits in the TLM Word being broadcast by
the GPS satellite identified by SatID, with the MSB occurring first in the
satellite transmission.
**Reference** **Location**
The Reference Location field contains a 3-D location (with uncertainty)
specified as per 3GPP TS 23.032. The purpose of this field is to provide the
MS with a priori knowledge of its location in order to improve GPS receiver
performance. The allowed shape is 3-D location with uncertainty (ellipsoid
point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid).
**DGPS Corrections**
These fields specify the DGPS corrections to be used by the MS. All fields are
mandatory when DGPS Corrections are present in the GPS Assistance Data.

**GPS TOW**
This field indicates the baseline time for which the corrections are valid.
**Status/Health**
This field indicates the status of the differential corrections contained in
the broadcast message. The values of this field and their respective meanings
are shown below in table A.16.
Table A.16: Values of Status/Health IE
* * *
Code Indication 000 UDRE Scale Factor = 1.0 001 UDRE Scale Factor = 0.75 010

0.2 101 UDRE Scale Factor = 0.1 110 Reference Station Transmission Not
Monitored 111 Data is invalid - disregard
* * *
The first six values in this field indicate valid differential corrections.
When using the values described below, the \"UDRE Scale Factor\" value is
applied to the UDRE values contained in the message. The purpose is to
indicate an estimate in the amount of error in the corrections.
The value \"110\" indicates that the source of the differential corrections
(e.g., reference station or external DGPS network) is currently not being
monitored. The value \"111\" indicates that the corrections provided by the
source are invalid, as judged by the source. In the later case, the message
shall contain no corrections for individual satellites. Any MS that receives
DGPS Corrections in a GPS Assistance Data IE shall contain the appropriate
logic to properly interpret this condition and look for the next IE.
**N_SAT**
This field indicates the number of satellites for which differential
corrections are available. Corrections for up to 16 satellites.
**SatID**
This field identifies the satellite for which the corrections are applicable.
The values ranging from 0 to 63 represent satellite PRNs ranging from 1 to 64,
respectively.
**IODE**
This IE is the sequence number for the ephemeris for the particular satellite.
The MS can use this IE to determine if new ephemeris is used for calculating
the corrections that are provided in the broadcast message. This eight-bit IE
identifies a particular set of ephemeris data for a GPS satellite and may
occupy the numerical range of [0, 255]. The transmitted IODE value will be
different from any value transmitted by the GPS satellite during the preceding
six hours. For more information about this field can be found from RTCM-SC104.
**User Differential Range Error** **(UDRE)**
This field provides an estimate of the uncertainty (1-Ïƒ) in the corrections
for the particular satellite. The value in this field shall be multiplied by
the UDRE Scale Factor in the common Corrections Status/Health field to
determine the final UDRE estimate for the particular satellite. The meanings
of the values for this field are described in table A.18.

PR~m~(_t_ ~1,~ IODE), by
PR(_t_ ~1,\ IODE~) = PR~m~(_t_ ~1,\ IODE~) + PRC(_t_ ~1,\ IODE~) .
The SMLC shall always send the RRC value that corresponds to the PRC value
that it sends (see above for details). The MS shall only use the RRC value
when the IODE value received matches its available navigation model.
**Delta Pseudo-Range Correction 2 (Delta PRC2)**
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall
ignore it.
**Delta Pseudo-Range Rate Correction 2 (Delta RRC2)**
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall
ignore it.
**Delta Pseudo-Range Correction 3 (Delta PRC3)**
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall
ignore it.
**Delta Pseudo-Range Rate Correction 3 (Delta RRC3)**
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall
ignore it.
**Navigation** **Model**
This set of fields contains information required to manage the transfer of
precise navigation data to the GPS-capable MS. In response to a request from
an MS for GPS assistance data, the SMLC shall determine whether to send the
navigation model for a particular satellite to an MS based upon factors like
the T-Toe limit specified by the MS and any request from the MS for DGPS (also
see above). This information includes control bit fields as well as satellite
ephemeris and clock corrections. The individual fields are given in Table A.19
below, and the conditions for their presence is discussed below.

**Num_Sats_Total**
This field specifies the number of satellites that are included in the
provided Navigation Model. A range of 1-16 is available. This field is
mandatory when the Navigation Model field is included in the message.
**SatID**
This field identifies the satellite for which the assistance is applicable.
This value is the same as the PRN number provided in the navigation message
transmitted by the particular satellite. The range is 0 to 63, with 0-31
indicating GPS satellites 1-32, respectively, and 32-63 indicating satellites
in future augmentation systems (e.g., WAAS or EGNOS). This field is mandatory
for each included satellite.
**Satellite** **Status**
This field is a two-bit value that indicates the status of the Navigation
Model for the particular satellite specified by SatID. This field is mandatory
for each included satellite. The MS shall interpret the combinations of the
two bits as follows.
Table A.20: Satellite Status (per-satellite field)
* * *
MSB LSB Interpretation 0 0 New satellite, new Navigation Model 0 1 Existing
satellite, same Navigation Model 1 0 Existing satellite, new Navigation Model
1 1 Reserved
* * *
This Satellite Navigation Model and associated bit fields include the
parameters that accurately model the orbit and clock state of the particular
satellite. For the particular satellite, these fields are conditional based on
the value of Satellite Status for that satellite. The fields are absent when
Satellite Status is \"01\", and present for all other values. The format for
the ephemeris, clock corrections, and associate bits are specified in ICD-
GPS-200.
**Ionospheric** **Model**
The Ionospheric Model contains fields needed to model the propagation delays
of the GPS signals through the ionosphere. The information elements in this
field are shown in table A.21. Proper use of these fields allows a
singleâ€‘frequency GPS receiver to remove approximately 50 % of the ionospheric
delay from the range measurements. The Ionospheric Model is valid for the
entire constellation and changes slowly relative to the Navigation Model. All
of the fields must be included when Ionospheric Model is present.

**Almanac**
These fields specify the coarse, long-term model of the satellite positions
and clocks. These fields are given in table A.23. With one exception (Î´i),
these parameters are a subset of the ephemeris and clock correction parameters
in the Navigation Model, although with reduced resolution and accuracy. The
almanac model is useful for receiver tasks that require coarse accuracy, such
as determining satellite visibility. The model is valid for up to one year,
typically. Since it is a long-term model, the field should be provided for all
satellites in the GPS constellation. All fields in the Almanac are mandatory
when the Almanac is present. The fields t~oa~ and WN~a~ specify the GPS time-
of-week and week number, respectively, that are the reference points for the
Almanac parameters.
The Almanac also is useful as an acquisition aid for network-based GPS
methods. Given a recent Almanac (\ _t_ ~0~, the corrections for IOD are estimated by
PRC(_t_ ~1,\ IOD~) = PRC(_t_ ~0,\ IOD~) + RRC(_t_ ~0,\ IOD~)â‹…(_t_ ~1~ - _t_
~0~) ,
and the MS uses this to correct the pseudorange it measures at _t_ ~1~,
PR~m~(_t_ ~1,~ IOD), by
PR(_t_ ~1,\ IOD~) = PR~m~(_t_ ~1,\ IOD~) + PRC(_t_ ~1,\ IOD~) .
The SMLC shall always send the RRC value that corresponds to the PRC value
that it sends (see above for details). The MS shall only use the RRC value
when the IOD value received matches its available navigation model.
**GANSS Navigation** **Model**
This set of fields contains information required to manage the transfer of
precise navigation data to the GANSS-capable MS. In response to a request from
a MS for GANSS Assistance Data, the SMLC shall determine whether to send the
navigation model for a particular satellite to an MS based upon factors like
the T-Toe limit specified by the MS and any request from the MS for DGANSS
(also see above). This information includes control bit fields as well as
satellite ephemeris and clock corrections and clock and orbit accuracy models.
GANSS Orbit Model can be given in Keplerian parameters or as state vector in
Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed coordinates, dependent on the GANSS-ID and the MS
capabilities. The meaning of these parameters is defined in relevant ICDs of
the particular GANSS and GNSS specific interpretations apply. For example,
Modernized GPS and QZSS use the same model parameters but some parameters have
a different interpretation [16].
GANSS Navigation Model element can contain data up to at most 32 satellites.
The individual fields are given in Table A.46 and the conditions for their
presence is discussed below.

field is mandatory when the GANSS Navigation Model field is included in the
GANSS Assistance Data message.

from satellite broadcast data or are given in a format not native to the
GANSS.

**SV Health and SV Health_MSB**
**This parameter gives information about the satellite's current health. The
health values are GNSS system specific. The SV Health bits have the encoding
as in Table A.48.1 for a particular GANSS. The SV Health_MSB may be present
for some GANSS or signals as defined in Table A.48.1. If SV Health_MSB is
present, the total SV Health information is created by appending the SV Health
field to the SV Health_MSB field.**

**GANSS Real-Time Integrity**
Integrity Monitor (IM) shall detect unhealthy (e.g., failed/failing) satellite
signals and also shall inform users of measurement quality in DGANSS modes
when satellite signals are healthy. Excessively large pseudo range errors, as
evidenced by the magnitude of the corresponding DGANSS correction, shall be
used to detect failed satellite signals. Unhealthy satellite signals should be
detected within 10 seconds of the occurrence of the satellite signal failure.
When unhealthy (e.g., failed/failing) satellite signals are detected, the
assistance and/or DGANSS correction data shall not be supplied for these
satellite signals. When the error in the IM computed position is excessive for
solutions based upon healthy satellite signals only, DGANSS users shall be
informed of measurement quality through the supplied UDRE values. After bad
satellite signals have been indicated in the Real Time Integrity field, if the
satellite signals return to healthy condition for some period of time, the
indications for them shall be removed from this field.
GANSS Real-Time Integrity field of the GANSS Assistance Data Information
Element contains parameters that describe the real-time status of the GANSS
constellations. Primarily intended for non-differential applications, the
real-time integrity of the satellite constellation is of importance as there
is no differential correction data by which the mobile can determine the
soundness of each satellite signal. GANSS Real-Time Integrity data
communicates the health of the GNSS signals to the mobile in real-time. The
format is shown in Table A.50. The SMLC shall always transmit the GANSS Real
Time Integrity field with the current list of unhealthy signals, for any GANSS
positioning attempt and whenever GANSS Assistance Data is sent. If the number
of bad signals (NBS) is zero, then the GANSS Real Time Integrity field shall
be omitted.

means that all signals on the specific SV are bad.** The interpretation of
Bad_GNSS_Signal_ID is listed in Table A.59. If the satellite in question
belongs to the modernized GPS constellation and has some healthy signals but
bad L1C/A signal, Bad_GNSS_Signal_ID shall be present but may have all the
bits set to '0'. Status of L1C/A signal shall be indicated with Real-Time
Integrity IE in GPS Assistance Data Element.
**GANSS Data Bit Assistance**
This element provides data bit assistance data for specific satellite signals
for data wipe-off. The data bits included in the assistance data depends on

In case of Galileo, it contains the FEC encoded and interleaved modulation
symbols. The logical levels 1 and 0 correspond to signal levels -1 and +1,
respectively. In case of Modernized GPS L1C, it contains the encoded and
interleaved modulation symbols as defined in [14] section 3.2.3.1.
In case of Modernized GPS L2C, it contains either the NAV data modulation
bits, the FEC encoded NAV data modulation symbols, or the FEC encoded CNAV

**GANSS Reference Measurement Information**
**This field provides reference code and Doppler measurement information of
visible satellites of a GANSS constellation. The information can be used as
acquisition assistance to improve the sensitivity of the receiver.**
**These** parameters describe the range and optionally the derivatives from
respective satellites to the GANSS Reference Location at the GANSS Reference
Time. The code phase and Doppler fields are aligned with the time provided in
GANSS Reference Time. Figure A.4a illustrates the relation between some of the
fields with respect to the GANSS TOD.
If GPS Acquisition Assistance is included the Reference Time included in the
GPS Acquisition Assistance is also valid for the GANSS Reference Measurement
fields and the parameters are referenced to GPS TOW. Figure A.4b illustrates
the relation between some of the fields with respect to GPS TOW.
The parameters are given in units of ms and m/s which makes it possible to
convert the values to any nominal frequency and chipping and code rate.

**Azimuth**
This field contains the azimuth angle. An angle of x degrees means the
satellite azimuth a is in the range (x â‰¤ a \< x+11.25) degrees. This field is
optional.
Range: 0 - 348.75 degrees.
**Elevation**
This field contains the elevation angle. An angle of y degrees means the
satellite elevation e is in the range (y â‰¤ e \< y+11.25) degrees except for y

**GANSS Almanac Model**
These fields specify the coarse, long-term model of the satellite positions
and clocks. These fields are given in Table A.54. The meaning of these
parameters is defined in relevant ICDs of the particular GANSS and GNSS
specific interpretations apply. For example, Modernized GPS and QZSS use the
same model parameters but some parameters have a different interpretation
[16].
GANSS Almanac Model is useful for receiver tasks that require coarse accuracy,
such as determining satellite visibility. The model is valid for up to few
weeks, typically. Since it is a long-term model, the field should be provided
for all satellites in the GNSS constellation.

**GANSS Ephemeris Extension**
The GANSS Ephemeris extension contains parameters designed to extend the time
of applicability of the Ephemeris terms by the continuous addition of the
delta ephemeris terms to the respective terms of the referenced ephemeris.
This message can provide extension information for every satellite for many
days into the future; doing so may create a large message, thus care must be
taken to consider the transport bandwidth. The SMLC can limit the duration of
the extension to decrease the message size. For example if the extension
duration is limited to twelve hours the payload will be approximately 2,000
octets, for a typical 27 satellite constellation.

**GANSS Delta Element List**
GANSS Delta Element List is a list of GANSS Ephemeris Delta Elements
**Ephemeris Delta Element**
Each GANSS Ephemeris Delta element is uniquely identified by the pair (seqNum,
sv_ID) and it is defined as a structure as shown in table A.55.11. The MS
should parse the octet string according to the fields specified in table
A.55.4. Each element in table A.55.4 but for seqNum and sv_ID should be
treated as a signed integer. Each Ephemeris delta is transmitted as an octet
string of up to 49 octets. The actual number of octets is determined by the
size of the bit fields in the GPS_Ephemeris_Delta_Sizes table (table A.55.9).
Each set of up to 49 octets represents a single extension for a single
satellite vehicle. Each set encodes the satellite vehicle ID and the sequence
number. The sequence number specifies the order in which the individual
ephemeris extension elements are assembled as time marches forward to create
the next ephemeris. The sequence number is the same for all satellite vehicle
IDs for a particular update period.

(1) The number of bits of each signed integer field is variable and it is
indicated once for all numEphemerisDeltas by the structure
ephemerisDeltasSizes. When the ephemerisDeltaSizes field is not present, the
values found in the columns "Default # Bits" shall be used.
(2) The scale factor of each parameter is variable around the default scale
factor. The variation for each field is indicated once for all
numEphemerisDeltas by the structure ephemerisDeltasScales. For example, if the
scale factor modifier for delta_omega has a value of 4, the scale factor for
delta_omega is 2^4^ * 2^-31^. When the ephemerisDeltaScales is not used, the
values found in the column "Default Scale" shall be used.
**sequenceNum**
This field indicates the order of the Ephemeris delta terms. The ephemeris
constructed for use in satellite positioning is built by adding the delta
terms to the referenced GANSS_Navigation Model in the order dictated by this
sequence number. The sequence number shall remain the same for each svID in a
group of Ephemeris Deltas corresponding to a particular update epoch.
**svID**
This field identifies the satellite ID within a particular sequenceNum.
These fields, with the exception of sequenceNum and svID, specify the deltas
to be added to the existing Ephemeris to create a new Ephemeris suite that is
extended from its predecessor by the time provided in the "validityPeriod"
parameter. To compute the time of ephemeris for the newly constructed
ephemeris, validityPeriod is added to the preceding toe. The ephemeris time of
clock (toc) is set equal to the toe.
For each of the other ephemeris terms the corresponding delta ephemeris term
is added in order to create the updated ephemeris. The terms delta_M0,
delta_i0, and delta_OMEGA0 of the delta ephemeris must be extrapolated prior
to the addition of the delta terms as follows:
Where $m$ is the WGS 84 value of the earth's gravitational constant for GANSS
user, and A~(i)~ is the semi-major axis associated with this satellite's
update. The extrapolation of delta_M0, uses the prior set's sqrtA term to
compute A~(i)~ .
OMEGA0~(i+1)~=OMEGA0~(i)~ +deltaOMEGA0~(i)~+OMEGAdot~(i)~*dt
i0 ~(i+1)~ = i0~(i)~ + delta_i0~(i)~+Idot~(i)~ * dt
Where dt is equal to validityPeriod*3600. The terms af0, and af1 from the
GANSS clock model must be extrapolated as follows:
af0~(i+1)~ = af0~(i)~ + af1~(i)~* dt + af2~(i)~*dt^2^
af1~(i+1)~ = af1~(i)~ + 2 * af2~(i)~ * d**t**
af2~(i+1)~ = af2~(i)~
Where af0, af1, and af2 are the clock model terms as shown in table A.49.1.
The following demonstrates the application of the ephemeris extension
technique. Assume the validityPeriod = 5, representing: (5+1)hours = 6 hours,
and the GANSS Navigation model for a particular satellite, identified by the
reference IOD has a toe = 0 seconds.
The toe for sequenceNumber 1 is computed by adding the validityPeriod to the
initial toe of 0 as 0 + 6 hours =0 + 21600 seconds. The new ephemeris is
constructed by adding the delta ephemeris terms from set 1 to the reference
ephemeris creating the new ephemeris, which will be used for the next six
hours. For the five terms listed above (delta_M0, delta_i0, delta_OMEGA0, af0,
and af1) the extrapolation described must occur prior to the addition of the
delta term. Of course if one of these three delta ephemeris terms was provided
in full via the exception table then the extrapolation is unnecessary and the
exception term combined with the delta_ephemeris term is used directly.
The next ephemeris computation will occur by adding the validityPeriod to the
current toe of 21600 as: 21600 + 6 hours = 21600 + 21600 = 43200. The
ephemeris delta terms from set two are added to the ephemeris resulting from
the prior addition to create the next ephemeris. This is done for each
satellite vehicle ID listed in the provided satellite list indicated in the
ganssSatRef field.
**GANSS Ephemeris Extension check**
The GANSS Ephemeris Extension check provides information about non foreseen
events that occurred during the period starting at the ganssBeginTime to the
current time. An event is signified through a bit string . Each bits refers to
one PRN. If a bit is set to one, this means that the ephemeris extension is no
longer valid for this specific PRN. In order to indicate planned future
manuvers an end time is provided. The SMLC can indicate that a future event is
planned between the current time and the end time of this ephemeris extension.

needed to relate GNSS system time to Universal Time Coordinate (UTC), as
defined in [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Only one parameter set can be included in
one GANSS Additional UTC Model and which set of parameters to include depends
on the GANSS-ID and MS capabilities.

##### GANSS Additional Assistance Data Choices {#ganss-additional-assistance-
data-choices .H6}
For GANSS Assistance Data elements for which multiple choices exist (GANSS
Clock Model (Table A.49.1), GANSS Orbit Model (Table A.49.2), GANSS Almanac
Model (Table A.54), and GANSS UTC Model/Additional UTC Model (Table
A.55/A.55.17)) the MS and SMLC shall support the native formats choice as
defined in the relevant ICDs for each GANSS signal. The MS can indicate which
additional non-native choice(s) is(are) supported for a particular GANSS using
a bit map with one bit per model where a one value indicates support and a
zero value no support. Note that native support need not be indicated in this
bit map.

#### A.8.2.3 Assistance Data Needed
This element indicates the types of assistance data that the MS may need to
obtain a location estimate or positioning measurements. The MS shall use this
IE to indicate to the SMLC all the supported assistance data types for which
the MS does not have current versions using the assistance data request IEs
defined in 3GPP TS 49.031. The SMLC can then decide which subset of these
assistance data types if any to download. The IE is encoded using the request
for assistance data IEs defined for GPS and GANSS in 3GPP TS 49.031, with the
following exceptions:
Requested GPS Assistance Data (clause 10.10 in 3GPP TS 49.031):
\- If the MS supports Navigation Model (Bit D), Ephemeris Extension (Bit J),
and Ephemeris Extension Check (Bit K), all three bits D, J, and K can be set
to value 1 if the MS has no current versions of these assistance data types.
If bit D is set to value 1, the coding of octets 5 to 8+2n shall be according
to Figure 10.10.2 in clause 10.10 of 3GPP TS 49.031.
Requested GANSS Assistance Data (clause 10.31 in 3GPP TS 49.031):
\- If the MS supports Navigation Model (Bit M), Ephemeris Extension (Bit N),
and Ephemeris Extension Check (Bit R), all three bits M, N, and R can be set
to value 1 if the MS has no current versions of these assistance data types.
\- If the MS supports GANSS Ephemeris Extension (Bit N) and the MS has no
current version of this assistance data type, bit N shall be set to value 1
but the corresponding extension octets in Figure 10.31.3d of 3GPP TS 49.031
shall be omitted.
\- If the MS supports GANSS Data Bit Assistance (Bit Q) and the MS has no
current version of this assistance data type, bit Q shall be set to value 1
but the corresponding extension octets in Figure 10.31.3c of 3GPP TS 49.031
shall be omitted.
\- If the MS supports GANSS Ephemeris Extension Check (Bit R) and the MS has
no current version of this assistance data type, bit R shall be set to value 1
but the corresponding extension octets in Figure 10.31.3e of 3GPP TS 49.031
shall be omitted.
