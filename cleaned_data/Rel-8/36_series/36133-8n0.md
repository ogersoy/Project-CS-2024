## 3.4 Test tolerances
The requirements given in the present document make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 36.521-3 [23] defines the test
tolerances. These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The test tolerances are then added to the limits in this specification to
create test limits. The measurement results are compared against the test
limits as defined by the shared risk principle.
Shared Risk is defined in [ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5].
# 4 E-UTRAN RRC_IDLE state mobility
## 4.1 Cell Selection
After a UE has switched on and a PLMN has been selected, the Cell selection
process takes place, as described in TS36.304. This process allows the UE to
select a suitable cell where to camp on in order to access available services.
In this process the UE can use stored information (_Stored information cell
selection_) or not (_Initial cell selection_).
## 4.2 Cell Re-selection
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable cell
and camp on it.
When the UE is in either _Camped_ _Normally_ state or _Camped on Any Cell_
state on a cell, the UE shall attempt to detect, synchronise, and monitor
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated by the serving
cell. For intra-frequency and inter-frequency cells the serving cell may not
provide explicit neighbour list but carrier frequency information and
bandwidth information only. UE measurement activity is also controlled by
measurement rules defined in TS36.304, allowing the UE to limit its
measurement activity.
### 4.2.2 Requirements
[Editor's Note: Requirements for multiple Tx antennas are still FFS. So far
only 1Tx antenna case has been considered.The number of Tx antennas and
possibly CP length may need to be provided per frequency layer. Details are
FFS. Low mobility and high mobility requirements are still FFS]
The UE shall search every layer of higher priority at least every
T~higher_priority_search~ = (60 * N~layers~) seconds, where N~layers~ is the
total number of configured higher priority E-UTRA, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD,
CDMA2000 1x and HRPD carrier frequencies and is additionally increased by one
if one or more groups of GSM frequencies is configured as a higher priority.
_Editors note: The measurement of cells that are detected in this search is
still to be described_.
#### 4.2.2.1 Measurement and evaluation of serving cell
The UE shall measure the RSRP level of the serving cell and evaluate the cell
selection criterion S defined in [1] for the serving cell at least every DRX
cycle.
The UE shall filter the RSRP measurements of the serving cell using at least 2
measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the filtering, at least
two measurements shall be spaced by, at least DRX cycle/2.
If the UE has evaluated in N~serv~ consecutive DRX cycles that the serving
cell does not fulfil the cell selection criterion S, the UE shall initiate the
measurements of all neighbour cells indicated by the serving cell, regardless
of the measurement rules currently limiting UE measurement activities.
If the UE in RRC_IDLE has not found any new suitable cell based on searches
and measurements using the intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT
information indicated in the system information for 10 s, the UE shall
initiate cell selection procedures for the selected PLMN as defined in [1].

#### 4.2.2.2 Void
#### 4.2.2.3 Measurements of intra-frequency E-UTRAN cells
The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform RSRP
measurements of identified intra-frequency cells without an explicit intra-
frequency neighbour list containing physical layer cell identities.
The UE shall be able to evaluate whether a newly detectable intra-frequency
cell meets the reselection criteria defined in TS36.304 within
T~detect,EUTRAN_Intra~ when that Treselection= 0 . An intra frequency cell is
considered to be detectable if:
\- RSRP\|~dBm~ [>]{.underline} -124 dBm for Bands 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -123 dBm for Bands 9 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -122 dBm for Bands 2, 5, 7 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -121 dBm for Bands 3, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4
dB,
\- SCH_RP\|~dBm~ [>]{.underline} -124 dBm for Bands 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 33, 34,
35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
> \- SCH_RP\|~dBm~≥-123 dBm for Band 9 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
>
> \- SCH_RP \|~dBm~≥ -122 dBm for Bands 2, 5, 7 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
>
> \- SCH_RP \|~dBm~≥ -121 dBm for Bands 3, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥
> -4 dB.
The UE shall measure RSRP at least every T~measure,EUTRAN_Intra~ (see table
4.2.2.3-1) for intra-frequency cells that are identified and measured
according to the measurement rules.
The UE shall filter RSRP measurements of each measured intra-frequency cell
using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the
filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
T~measure,EUTRAN_Intra~/2
The UE shall not consider a E-UTRA neighbour cell in cell reselection, if it
is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system information of
the serving cell.
For an intra-frequency cell that has been already detected, but that has not
been reselected to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable
of evaluating that the intra-frequency cell has met reselection criterion
defined [1] within T~evaluate,E-UTRAN_intra~ when T~reselection~ = 0 as
specified in table 4.2.2.3-1 provided that the cell is at least 3dB better
ranked. When evaluating cells for reselection, the side conditions for RSRP
and SCH apply to both serving and non-serving intra-frequency cells.
If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the intra-frequency cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this intra-
frequency cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains better ranked
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.

#### 4.2.2.4 Measurements of inter-frequency E-UTRAN cells
The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform RSRP
measurements of identified inter-frequency cells if carrier frequency
information is provided by the serving cell, even if no explicit neighbour
list with physical layer cell identities is provided.
If the S~ServingCell~ of the E-UTRA serving cell is greater than
S~nonintrasearch~ then the UE shall search for inter-frequency layers of
higher priority at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2.
If the S~ServingCell~ of the E-UTRA serving cell is less than or equal to
S~nonintrasearch~ then the UE shall search for and measure inter-frequency
layers of higher, equal or lower priority in preparation for possible
reselection. In this scenario, the minimum rate at which the UE is required to
search for and measure higher priority layers shall be the same as that
defined below.
The UE shall be able to evaluate whether a newly detectable inter-frequency
cell meets the reselection criteria defined in TS36.304 within K~carrier~ *
T~detect,EUTRAN_Inter~ if at least carrier frequency information is provided
for inter-frequency neighbour cells by the serving cells when T~reselection~ =
0 provided that the reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least 5dB
for reselections based on ranking or 6dB for reselections based on absolute
priorities. The parameter K~carrier~ is the number of E-UTRA inter-frequency
carriers indicated by the serving cell. An inter-frequency cell is considered
to be detectable if:
\- RSRP\|~dBm~ ≥ -124 dBm for Bands 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
39, 40 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -123 dBm for Bands 9 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -122 dBm for Bands 2, 5, 7 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
\- RSRP\|~dBm~≥ -121 dBm for Bands 3, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17 and RSRP Ês/Iot ≥ -4
dB,
\- SCH_RP\|~dBm~ ≥ -124 dBm for Bands 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
39, 40 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
> \- SCH_RP\|~dBm~≥-123 dBm for Band 9 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
>
> \- SCH_RP \|~dBm~≥ -122 dBm for Bands 2, 5, 7 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -4 dB,
>
> \- SCH_RP \|~dBm~≥ -121 dBm for Bands 3, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17 and SCH Ês/Iot ≥
> -4 dB.
When higher priority cells are found by the higher priority search, they shall
be measured at least every T~measure,E-UTRAN_Inter~ . If, after detecting a
cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not
occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell
to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum
measurement filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still
be met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring
the cell. If the UE detects on a E-UTRA carrier a cell whose physical identity
is indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell, the UE is not required to perform
measurements on that cell.
The UE shall measure RSRP at least every K~carrier~ * T~measure,EUTRAN_Inter~
(see table 4.2.2.4-1) for identified lower or equal priority inter-frequency
cells. If the UE detects on a E-UTRA carrier a cell whose physical identity is
indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell, the UE is not required to perform
measurements on that cell.
The UE shall filter RSRP measurements of each measured higher, lower and equal
priority inter-frequency cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of
measurements used for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced
by at least T~measure,EUTRAN_Inter~/2.
The UE shall not consider a E-UTRA neighbour cell in cell reselection, if it
is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system information of
the serving cell.
For an inter-frequency cell that has been already detected, but that has not
been reselected to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable
of evaluating that the inter-frequency cell has met reselection criterion
defined TS 36.304 within K~carrier~ * T~evaluate,E-UTRAN_Inter~ when
T~reselection~ = 0 as specified in table 4.2.2.4-1 provided that the
reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least 5dB for reselections based
on ranking or 6dB for reselections based on absolute priorities. When
evaluating cells for reselection, the side conditions for RSRP and SCH apply
to both serving and inter-frequency cells.
If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this inter-
frequency cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains better ranked
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.

#### 4.2.2.5 Measurements of inter-RAT cells
If the S~ServingCell~of the E-UTRA serving cell is greater than
S~nonintrasearch~ then ythe UE shall search for inter-RAT layers of higher
priority at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2.
If the S~ServingCell~of the E-UTRA serving cell is less than or equal to
S~nonintrasearch~then the UE shall search for and measure inter-RAT layers of
higher, lower priority in preparation for possible reselection. In this
scenario, the minimum rate at which the UE is required to search for and
measure higher priority inter-RAT layers shall be the same as that defined
below for lower priority RATs.
##### 4.2.2.5.1 Measurements of UTRAN FDD cells
When the measurement rules indicate that UTRA FDD cells are to be measured,
the UE shall measure CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP of detected UTRA FDD cells in
the neighbour frequency list at the minimum measurement rate specified in this
section. The parameter N~UTRA_carrier~ is the number of carriers used in the
neighbour frequency list. The UE shall filter CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP
measurements of each measured UTRA FDD cell using at least 2 measurements.
Within the set of measurements used for the filtering, at least two
measurements shall be spaced by at least half the minimum specified
measurement period.
The UE shall evaluate whether newly detectable UTRA FDD cells have met the
reselection criteria in TS 36.304 within time (N~UTRA_carrier~) *
T~detectUTRA_FDD~ when the S~ServingCell~ of the E-UTRA serving cell is less
than S~nonintrasearch~ when Treselection~RAT~ = 0 provided that the
reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least 6dB.
Cells which have been detected shall be measured at least every
(N~UTRA_carrier~) * T~measureUTRA_FDD~ when the S~ServingCell~ of the E-UTRA
serving cell is less than S~nonintrasearch~.
When higher priority UTRA FDD cells are found by the higher priority search,
they shall be measured at least every T~measure,UTRA_FDD~. If, after detecting
a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not
occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell
to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum
measurement filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still
be met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring
the cell.
For a cell that has been already detected, but that has not been reselected
to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating
that an already identified UTRA FDD cell has met reselection criterion defined
in 3GPP TS 36.304 [1] within (N~UTRA_carrier~) * T~evaluateUTRA_FDD~ when
T~reselection~ = 0 as speficied in table 4.2.2.5.1-1 provided that the
reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least 6dB.

##### 4.2.2.5.2 Measurements of UTRAN TDD cells
When the measurement rules indicate that UTRA TDD cells are to be measured,
the UE shall measure P-CCPCH RSCP of detected UTRA TDD cells in the neighbour
frequency list at the minimum measurement rate specified in this section. The
parameter N~UTRA_carrier_TDD~ is the number of carriers in the neighbour
frequency list. The UE shall filter P-CCPCH RSCP measurements of each measured
UTRA TDD cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements
used for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
half the minimum specified measurement period. P-CCPCH RSCP of UTRAN TDD cells
shall not be filtered over a longer period than that specified in table
4.2.2.5.2-1.
The UE shall evaluate whether newly detectable UTRA TDD cells have met the
reselection criteria in TS 36.304 within time (N~UTRA_carrier_TDD~) *
T~detectUTRA_TDD~ when the S~ServingCell~ of the E-UTRA serving cell is less
than S~nonintrasearch~ when T~reselection~ = 0 provided that the reselection
criteria is met by a margin of at least 6dB.
Cells which have been detected shall be measured at least every
(N~UTRA_carrier_TDD~) * T~measureUTRA_TDD~ when the S~ServingCell~ of the
E-UTRA serving cell is less than S~nonintrasearch~.
When higher priority UTRA TDD cells are found by the higher priority search,
they shall be measured at least every T~measure,UTRA_TDD~. If, after detecting
a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not
occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell
to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum
measurement filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still
be met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring
the cell.
For a cell that has been already detected, but that has not been reselected
to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating
that an already identified UTRA TDD cell has met reselection criterion defined
in [1] within N~UTRA_carrier_TDD~ *T~evaluateUTRA_TDD~ when T~reselection~ = 0
as specified in table 4.2.2.5.2-1 provided that the reselection criteria is
met by a margin of at least 6dB.

##### 4.2.2.5.3 Measurements of GSM cells
When the measurement rules defined in [1] indicate that E-UTRAN inter-
frequencies or inter-RAT frequency cells are to be measured, the UE shall
measure the signal level of the GSM BCCH carriers if the GSM BCCH carriers are
indicated in the measurement control system information of the serving cell.
GSM BCCH carriers of lower priority than the serving cell shall be measured at
least every T~measure,GSM~ (see table 4.2.2.5.3-1).
When higher priority GSM BCCH carriers are found by the higher priority
search, they shall be measured at least every T~measure,GSM,~ and the UE shall
decode the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier. If, after detecting a cell in a
higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not occurred
then the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell to
evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection, or to continuously verify the
BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier every 30s. However, the minimum measurement
filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still be met by
the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring the cell.
The UE shall maintain a running average of 4 measurements for each GSM BCCH
carrier. The measurement samples for each cell shall be as far as possible
uniformly distributed over the averaging period.
If continuous GSM measurements are required by the measurement rules in [1],
the UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC at least every 30 seconds for each of
the 4 strongest GSM BCCH carriers. If a change of BSIC is detected for one GSM
cell then that GSM BCCH carrier shall be treated as a new GSM neighbour cell.
If the UE detects on a BCCH carrier a BSIC which is indicated as not allowed
for that carrier in the measurement control system information of the serving
cell, the UE is not required to perform BSIC re-confirmation for that cell.
The UE shall not consider the GSM BCCH carrier in cell reselection, if the UE
cannot demodulate the BSIC of that GSM BCCH carrier. Additionally, the UE
shall not consider a GSM neighbour cell in cell reselection, if it is
indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system information of the
serving cell.

S~nonintrasearch~, the UE shall search for CDMA2000 HRPD layers of higher
priority at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is defined in section 4.2.2.
For CDMA2000 HRPD cells which have been detected, the UE shall measure
CDMA2000 HRPD Pilot Strength at least every (Number of HRPD Neighbor
Frequency)*T~measureHRPD~, when the S~ServingCell~ of the E-UTRA serving cell
is less than or equal to S~nonintrasearch~.
The UE shall be capable of evaluating that the CDMA2000 HRPD cell has met cell
reselection criterion defined in [1] within T~evaluateHRPD~.

In order to perform measurement and cell reselection to cdma2000 1X cell, the
UE shall acquire the timing of cdma2000 1X cells.
When the measurement rules indicate that cdma2000 1X cells are to be measured,
the UE shall measure cdma2000 1x RTT Pilot Strength of cdma2000 1X cells in
the neighbour cell list at the minimum measurement rate specified in this
section.
The parameter 'Number of CDMA2000 1X Neighbor Frequency', which is transmitted
on E-UTRAN BCCH, is the number of carriers used for all cdma2000 1X cells in
the neighbour cell list.
If S~ServingCell~ of the E-UTRA serving cell is greater than
S~nonintrasearch~, the UE shall search for cdma2000 1X layers of higher
priority at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is defined in section 4.2.2.
For CDMA2000 1X cells which have been detected, the UE shall measure CDMA2000
1xRTT Pilot Strength at least every (Number of CDMA2000 1X Neighbor
Frequency)*T~measureCDMA2000_1X~, when the S~ServingCell~ of the E-UTRA
serving cell is less than or equal to S~nonintrasearch~.
The UE shall be capable of evaluating that the cdma2000 1X cell has met cell
reselection criterion defined in [1] within T~evaluateCDMA2000_1X~.

#### 4.2.2.6 Evaluation of cell re-selection criteria
The UE shall evaluate the intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cell
reselection criteria defined in [1] at least every DRX cycle. When a non zero
value of T~reselection~ is used, the UE shall only perform reselection on an
evaluation which occurs simultaneously to, or later than the expiry of the
T~reselection~ timer.
#### 4.2.2.7 Maximum interruption in paging reception
UE shall perform the cell re-selection with minimum interruption in monitoring
downlink channels for paging reception.

start monitoring downlink channels of the target intra-frequency and inter-
frequency cell for paging reception. The interruption time shall not exceed
T~SI-EUTRA~ + 50 ms.
At inter-RAT cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor the downlink of serving
cell for paging reception until the UE is capable to start monitoring downlink
channels for paging reception of the target inter-RAT cell. For E-UTRAN to
UTRA cell re-selection the interruption time must not exceed T~SI-UTRA~ + 50
ms. For E-UTRAN to GSM cell re-selection the interruption time must not exceed
T~BCCH~ + 50 ms.
T~SI-EUTRA~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure

T~SI-UTRA~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure
delay of system information blocks defined in [7] for a UTRAN cell.
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from a GSM cell defined
in [8].
These requirements assume sufficient radio conditions, so that decoding of
system information can be made without errors and does not take into account
cell re-selection failure.
At cell re-selection to HRPD, the UE shall monitor the downlink of serving
cell for paging reception until the UE is capable of starting to monitor
downlink channels for paging reception of the target HRPD cell. For HRPD cell
re-selection the interruption time must not exceed T~SI-HRPD~ + 50 ms.
T~SI-HRPD~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the upper layer
(Layer 3) procedure delay of system information blocks defined in [11] in for
HRPD cell.

includes serving layer, comprising of any above defined combination of E-UTRA
FDD, E-UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, GSM (one GSM layer corresponds to 32
cells) , cdma2000 1x and HRPD layers.
#### 4.2.2.10 Reselection to CSG cells
Note: Requirements in this section are minimum requirements defined to ensure
the testability of autonomous CSG search. Further information on autonomous
search times in practical deployments is available in [25].
Reselection from non CSG to CSG cells may be performed using UE autonomous
search as defined in [1] when at least one CSG ID is included in the UE's
**CSG** white**list**. The requirements in this section are valid for
reselection to CSG cells previously visited by the UE when the radio
configuration parameters, including the carrier frequency and physical cell
identity of the CSG cell, non CSG cell and other neighbour cells are unchanged
from the most recent previous visit.
NOTE: The UE autonomous search function, per UE implementation, determines
when and/or where to search for allowed CSG cells.
##### 4.2.2.10.1 Reselection from a non CSG to an inter-frequency CSG cell
The UE shall perform search and reselection to an allowed inter-frequency CSG
cell that has met CSG reselection criterion defined in [1] and that is in its
whitelist, within 6 minutes in the conditions shown in table 4.2.2.10.1-1.
There is no need for statistical testing of this requirement.

## 5.1 E-UTRAN Handover
### 5.1.1 Introduction
### 5.1.2 Requirements
#### 5.1.2.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- FDD
The requirements in this section are applicable to both intra-frequency and
inter-frequency handovers.
##### 5.1.2.1.1 Handover delay
Procedure delays for all procedures that can command a handover are specified
in [2].
When the UE receives a RRC message implying handover the UE shall be ready to
start the transmission of the new uplink PRACH channel within D~handover~
seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command.
Where:
D~handover~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay to be defined in section
11.2 in 3GPP TS 36.331 [2] plus the interruption time stated in section
5.1.2.1.2.
##### 5.1.2.1.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between end of the last TTI containing the
RRC command on the old PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission of the
new PRACH, excluding the RRC procedure delay. This requirement applies when UE
is not required to perform any synchronisation procedure before transmitting
on the new PRACH.
When intra-frequency or inter-frequency handover is commanded, the
interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt
Tinterrupt = T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms
Where:
> T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the target
> cell is not already known when the handover command is received by the UE.
> If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target cell is
> unknown and signal quality is sufficient for successful cell detection on
> the first attempt, then T~search~ = 80 ms. Regardless of whether DRX is in
> use by the UE, T~search~ shall still be based on non-DRX target cell search
> times
T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH
occasion in the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.
> NOTE: The actual value of T~IU~ shall depend upon the PRACH configuration
> used in the target cell.
>
> In the interruption requirement a cell is known if it has been meeting the
> relevant cell identification requirement during the last 5 seconds otherwise
> it is unknown. Relevant cell identification requirements are described in
> Section 8.1.2.2.1 for intra-frequency handover and Section 8.1.2.3.1 for
> inter-frequency handover.
#### 5.2.2.2 E-UTRAN FDD -- TDD
The requirements in this section are applicable to handover from FDD to TDD.
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and TDD.
The requirements in section 5.2.2.4 apply for this section.
##### 5.2.2.2.1 (Void)
##### 5.2.2.2.2 (Void)
#### 5.2.2.3 E-UTRAN TDD -- FDD
The requirements in this section are applicable to handover from TDD to FDD.
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and TDD.
The requirements in section 5.1.2.1 apply for this section.
##### 5.2.2.3.1 (Void)
##### 5.2.2.3.2 (Void)
#### 5.2.2.4 E-UTRAN TDD -- TDD
The requirements in this section are applicable to both intra-frequency and
inter-frequency handovers.
#### 5.2.2.4.1 Handover delay
Procedure delays for all procedures that can command a handover are specified
in 3GPP TS 36.331 [2].
When the UE receives a RRC message implying handover, the UE shall be ready to
start the transmission of the new uplink PRACH channel within D~handover~
seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command.
Where:
D~handover~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay to be defined in section
11.2 in 3GPP TS36.331 [2] plus the interruption time stated in section 5.
2.2.4.2.
##### 5.2.2.4.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between end of the last TTI containing the
RRC command on the old PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission of the
new PRACH, excluding the RRC procedure delay. This requirement applies when UE
is not required to perform any synchronisation procedure before transmitting
on the new PRACH.
When intra-frequency or inter-frequency handover is commanded, the
interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt
Tinterrupt = T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms
Where

occasion in the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.

In the interruption requirement a cell is known if it has been meeting the
relevant cell identification requirement during the last 5 seconds otherwise
it is unknown. Relevant cell identification requirements are described in
Section 8.1.2.2.2 for intra-frequency handover and Section 8.1.2.3.4 for
inter-frequency handover.
## 5.3 Handover to other RATs
### 5.3.1 E-UTRAN - UTRAN FDD Handover
#### 5.3.1.1 Introduction
The purpose of inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN FDD is to change the
radio access mode from E-UTRAN to UTRAN FDD. The handover procedure is
initiated from E-UTRAN with a RRC message that implies a hard handover as
described in [2].
##### 5.3.1.1.1 Handover delay
When the UE receives a RRC message implying handover to UTRAN the UE shall be
ready to start the transmission of the new UTRA uplink DPCCH within
D~handover~ seconds from the end of the last E-UTRAN TTI containing the RRC
MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command.
where:
\- D~handover~ equals the RRC procedure delay, which is 50 ms plus the
interruption time stated in section 5.3.1.1.2.
##### 5.3.1.1.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between the end of the last TTI containing
the RRC command on the E-UTRAN PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission
on the uplink DPCCH in UTRAN FDD, excluding the RRC procedure delay. The
interruption time depends on whether the target cell is known to the UE or
not.
The target cell is known if it has been measured by the UE during the last 5
seconds otherwise it is unknown. The UE shall always perform a UTRA
synchronisation procedure as part of the handover procedure.
If the target cell is known the interruption time shall be less than
Tinterrupt1
Tinterrupt1 = T~IU~+T~sync~+50+ 10*F~max~ ms
If the target cell is unknown the interruption time shall be less than
Tinterrupt2
> Tinterrupt2 = T~IU~+T~sync~+150 + 10*F~max~ ms
This requirement shall be met, provided that there is one target cell in the
MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command. Performance requirements for E-UTRA to UTRA soft
handover are not specified. When UE is connected to an E-UTRA cell, UTRA SFN
timing measurements are not reported. This implies that the timing of the DPCH
of the UTRA target cells in the active set cannot be configured by UTRAN to
guarantee that all target cells fall within the UE reception window of T~0~
+/- 148 chips.
Where:
T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty when changing the timing from the
E-UTRAN to the new UTRAN cell. T~IU~ can be up to one UTRA frame (10 ms).
F~max~ denotes the maximum number of radio frames within the transmission time
intervals of all transport channels that are multiplexed into the same CCTrCH
on the UTRA target cell.
T~sync~ is the time required for measuring the downlink DPCCH channel as
stated in 3GPP TS 25.214 section 4.3.1.2 [20]. In case higher layers indicate
the usage of a post-verification period T~sync~=0 ms. Otherwise T~sync~=40 ms.
The phase reference is the primary CPICH.
The requirements in this section assume that N312 has the smallest possible
value i.e. only one insync is required.
### 5.3.2 E-UTRAN - UTRAN TDD Handover
#### 5.3.2.1 Introduction
The purpose of inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN TDD is to change the
radio access mode from E-UTRAN to UTRAN TDD. The handover procedure is
initiated from E-UTRAN with a RRC message that implies a hard handover as
described in [2].
#### 5.3.2.2 Requirements
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting E-UTRAN and
UTRAN TDD.
##### 5.3.2.2.1 Handover delay
When the UE receives a RRC message implying E-UTRAN/UTRAN TDD handover the UE
shall be ready to start the transmission of the new uplink DPCH or the SYNC-UL
within D~handover~ seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command.
Where:
\- D~handover~ equals the RRC procedure delay, which is 50 ms plus the
interruption time stated in section 5.3.2.2.
##### 5.3.2.2.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between the end of the last TTI containing
the RRC command on the E-UTRAN PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission
on the uplink DPCH or the SYNC-UL in UTRAN TDD, excluding the RRC procedure
delay. The interruption time depends on whether the target cell is known to
the UE or not.
The UE shall always perform a UTRA synchronisation procedure as part of the
handover procedure.
If the target cell has been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds, the
interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt1
T~interrupt1~= T~offset~+T~UL~+30*F~SFN~+20 +10*F~max~ ms
If the target cell has not been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds,
the interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt2
T~interrupt2~= T~offset~+T~UL~+30*F~SFN~+180 +10*F~max~ ms
Where:
T~offset~ Equal to 10 ms, the frame timing uncertainty between the old cell
and the target cell and the time that can elapse until the appearance of a
Beacon channel
T~UL~ Equal to 10 ms, the time that can elapse until the appearance of the UL
timeslot in the target cell
F~SFN~ Equal to 1 if SFN decoding is required and equal to 0 otherwise
F~max~ denotes the maximum number of radio frames within the transmission time
intervals of all transport channels that are multiplexed into the same CCTrCH.
The interruption time requirements for an unknown target cell shall apply only
if the signal quality of the unknown target cell is sufficient for successful
synchronisation with one attempt.
### 5.3.3 E-UTRAN - GSM Handover
#### 5.3.3.1 Introduction
The purpose of inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN to GSM is to transfer a
connection between the UE and E-UTRAN to GSM. The handover procedure is
initiated from E-UTRAN with a RRC message (MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA). The
procedure is described in in 3GPP TS 36.331 [2].
#### 5.3.3.2 Requirements
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting E-UTRAN and GSM.
The requirements given below in Tables 5.3.3.2.1-1 and 5.3.3.2.2-1 for the
case where the UE has not synchronised to the GSM cell before receiving the
RRC MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command are valid when the signal quality of the GSM
cell is sufficient for successful synchronisation with one attempt. If the UE
is unable to synchronise to the GSM cell on the first attempt, it shall
continue to search for synchronisation information for up to 800 ms duration.
If after 800 ms the UE has not synchronised to the GSM cell it shall follow
the handover failure procedure specified in [2].
##### 5.3.3.2.1 Handover delay
When the UE receives a RRC MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA command the UE shall be ready
to transmit (as specified in [10]) on the channel of the new RAT within the
value in table 5.3.3.2.1-1 from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command. The UE shall process the RRC procedures for the MOBILITY FROM E-UTRA
command within 50 ms, which is noted as RRC procedure delay.

* * *
##### 5.3.3.2.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between the end of the last TTI containing
the RRC command on the E-UTRAN PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission
on the uplink channel in GSM, excluding the RRC procedure delay. The
interruption time depends on whether the UE has synchronized to the target GSM
cell or not and shall be less than the value specified in table 5.3.3.2.2-1.

## 5.4 Handover to Non-3GPP RATs
### 5.4.1 E-UTRAN -- HRPD Handover

The handover delay (D~handover~) is defined as the sum of the RRC procedure
delay, which is 50 ms and the interruption time specified in section

When the UE receives a RRC message implying handover to HRPD, the UE shall be
ready to start the transmission of the new reverse control channel in HRPD
within D~handover~ from the end of the last E-UTRAN TTI containing the RRC
command.
##### 5.4.1.1.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between the end of the last TTI containing
the RRC command on the E-UTRAN PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission
of the reverse control channel in HRPD, excluding the RRC procedure delay. The
interruption time depends on whether the target cell is known to the UE or
not.
An HRPD cell is known if it has been measured by the UE during the last 5
seconds otherwise it is unknown. Under the reference conditions specified in
sub-clause 6.6 of [13], the interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt

where srch_win_o is the number of HRPD chips indicated by the search window
for unknown target HRPD cells in the message
KC It is the number of known target HRPD cells in the message, and
OC It is the number of unknown target HRPD cells in the message.
Note: An additional delay in the interruption time may occur due to the
reverse link silence interval [11], which is specific to HRPD.

RRC re-establishment; N~freq~ = 1 if the target cell is known.
There is no requirement if the target cell does not contain the UE context.
## 6.2 Random Access
### 6.2.1 Introduction
The random access procedure is used when establishing the layer 1
communication between the UE and E-UTRAN. The random access is specified in
section 6 of TS 36.213[3] and the control of the RACH transmission is
specified in section 5.1 of TS 36.321[17].
### 6.2.2 Requirements

#### 6.2.2.1 Contention based random access
##### 6.2.2.1.1 Correct behaviour when receiving Random Access Response

the msg3 if the Random Access Response contains a Random Access Preamble
identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble.

# 7 Timing and signalling characteristics
## 7.1 UE transmit timing
### 7.1.1 Introduction
The UE shall have capability to follow the frame timing change of the
connected eNode B. The uplink frame transmission takes place $(N_{\text{TA}} +
N_{\text{TA\ offset}}) \times T_{s}$ before the reception of the first
detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink frame from the reference
cell UE initial transmit timing accuracy, maximum amount of timing change in
one adjustment, minimum and maximum adjustment rate are defined in the
following requirements.
### 7.1.2 Requirements
The UE initial transmission timing error shall be less than or equal to ±T~e~
where the timing error limit value T~e~ is specified in Table 7.1.2-1. This
requirement applies when it is the first transmission in a DRX cycle for
PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS or it is the PRACH transmission. The reference point for
the UE initial transmit timing control requirement shall be the downlink
timing minus $(N_{\text{TA_Ref}} + N_{\text{TA\ offset}}) \times T_{s}$. The
downlink timing is defined as the time when [the first detected path (in
time)] of the corresponding downlink frame is received from the reference
cell. _N_ ~TA_Ref~ for PRACH is defined as 0. $(N_{\text{TA_Ref}} +
N_{\text{TA\ offset}})$ (in _T~s~_ units) for other channels is the difference
between UE transmission timing and the Downlink timing immediately after when
the last timing advance in section 7.3 was applied. _N_ ~TA_Ref~ for other
channels is not changed until next timing advance is received.
Table 7.1.2-1: T~e~ Timing Error Limit
* * *
Downlink Bandwidth (MHz) T~e_~ 1.4 24*T~S~ ≥3 12*T~S~ Note: T~S~ is the basic
timing unit defined in TS 36.211
* * *
When it is not the first transmission in a DRX cycle or there is no DRX cycle,
and when it is the transmission for PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS transmission, the UE
shall be capable of changing the transmission timing according to the received
downlink frame except when the timing advance in section 7.3 is applied. When
the transmission timing error between the UE and the reference timing exceeds
±T~e~ the UE is required to adjust its timing to within ±T~e~. The reference
timing shall be $(N_{\text{TA_Ref}} + N_{\text{TA\ offset}}) \times T_{s}$
before the downlink timing. All adjustments made to the UE uplink timing shall
follow these rules:
1) The maximum amount of the magnitude of the timing change in one adjustment
shall be T~q~ seconds.
2) The minimum aggregate adjustment rate shall be 7*T~S~ per second.
3) The maximum aggregate adjustment rate shall be T~q~ per 200ms.
where the maximum autonomous time adjustment step T~q~ is specified in Table
7.1.2-2.

* * *
## 7.2 UE timer accuracy
### 7.2.1 Introduction
UE timers are used in different protocol entities to control the UE behaviour.
### 7.2.2 Requirements
For UE timers specified in section 7.3 in [2], UE shall comply with the timer
accuracies according to Table 7.2.2-1.
The requirements are only related to the actual timing measurements internally
in the UE. They do not include the following:
\- Inaccuracy in the start and stop conditions of a timer (e.g. UE reaction
time to detect that start and stop conditions of a timer is fulfilled), or
\- Inaccuracies due to restrictions in observability of start and stop
conditions of a UE timer (e.g. TTI alignment when UE sends messages at timer
expiry).

## 7.5 Synchronization Requirements for E-UTRAN to 1xRTT and HRPD Handovers
### 7.5.1 Introduction
This section contains the synchronization requirements for eNodeB capable of
supporting E-UTRAN to CDMA 1xRTT and HRPD handovers. To facilitate E-UTRAN to
CDMA 1xRTT and HRPD handovers, the CDMA System Time reference needs to be
provided to the UE in order for the UE to report the pilot PN phases of the
target 1xRTT or HRPD cells. This is achieved through the SIB8 message
broadcasted by the serving eNodeB:
> If the eNodeB is synchronized to the GPS time then the size of CDMA System
> Time information is 39 bits and the unit is 10 ms based on a 1.2288 Mcps
> chip rate.
>
> If the eNodeB is not synchronized to the GPS time then the size of CDMA
> System Time information is 49 bits and the unit is 8 CDMA chips based on
> 1.2288 Mcps chip rate.
The CDMA system time reference provided by the serving eNodeB has to be within
a certain level of accuracy in order to facilitate accurate reporting of the
pilot PN phases of the target 1xRTT or HRPD cells and enable reliable handover
to the 1xRTT or HRPD networks.
### 7.5.2 eNodeB Synchronization Requirements
#### 7.5.2.1 Synchronized E-UTRAN
The eNodeB shall be synchronized to the GPS time. With external source of CDMA
System Time disconnected, the eNodeB shall maintain the timing accuracy within
±10 μs of CDMA System Time for a period of not less than 8 hours.
The timing deviation between the SFN boundary at or immediately after the
ending boundary of the SI-window in which _SystemInformationBlockType8_
(containing the broadcasted CDMA System Time with 10-ms granularity) is
transmitted and the broadcasted CDMA System Time shall be within 10 μs.
#### 7.5.2.2 Non-Synchronized E-UTRAN
The timing deviation between the SFN boundary at or immediately after the end
of the boundary of the SI-window in which _SystemInformationBlockType8_
(containing the broadcasted CDMA System Time with 8-chip granularity) is
transmitted and the broadcasted CDMA System Time shall be within 10 μs. With
external source of CDMA System Time disconnected the SFN boundary at or
immediately after the broadcasted CDMA System Time in the SIB8 message shall
maintain the timing accuracy within ±10 μs of CDMA System Time for a period of
not less than 8 hours.
## 7.6 Radio Link Monitoring
### 7.6 .1 Introduction
The UE shall monitor the downlink link quality based on the cell-specific
reference signal in order to detect the downlink radio link quality of the
serving cell as specified in [3].
The UE shall estimate the downlink radio link quality and compare it to the
thresholds Q~out~ and Q~in~ for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link
quality of the serving cell.
The threshold Q~out~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio link
cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to 10% block error rate of a
hypothetical PDCCH transmission taking into account the PCFICH errors with
transmission parameters specified in Table 7.6.1-1.
The threshold Q~in~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio link
quality can be significantly more reliably received than at Q~out~ and shall
correspond to 2% block error rate of a hypothetical PDCCH transmission taking
into account the PCFICH errors with transmission parameters specified in Table
7.6.1-2.

strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier having the highest
measured GSM carrier RSSI value. The parameter N~freq~ is defined in section
8.1.2.1.1.
If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE shall
continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH carrier, in signal
strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has been

corresponding to the non DRX requirements as specified in section
8.1.2.4.5.1.2.2 shall apply.
For DRX cycle length > 40 ms, at least every N~freq~*30 seconds, the UE shall
attempt to decode the BSIC of each identified GSM cell.If the UE fails to
decode the BSIC after two successive attempts or if the UE has not been able
to re-confirm the BSIC for a GSM cell within N~freq~*60 seconds, the UE shall
abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM cell shall
be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the GSM cell shall be

reporting criteria are fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event that
will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes that
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the
DCCH.
The event triggered reporting delay requirement is valid when the UE for each
GSM carrier in the monitored set can take the required number of samples
during the measurement period T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ (see section

## 8.2 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria
### 8.2.1 Introduction
This section contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of event
triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement configuration
does not exceed the requirements stated in section 8.2.2, the UE shall meet
the performance requirements defined in section 9.
The UE can be requested to make measurements under different measurement
identities defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 [2]. Each measurement identity
corresponds to either event based reporting, periodic reporting or no
reporting. In case of event based reporting, each measurement identity is
associated with an event. In case of periodic reporting, a measurement
identity is associated with one periodic reporting criterion. In case of no
reporting, a measurement identity is associated with one no reporting
criterion.
The purpose of this section is to set some limits on the number of different
event, periodic and no reporting criteria the UE may be requested to track in
parallel.
### 8.2.2 Requirements
In this section a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event (in the
case of event based reporting), or one periodic reporting criterion (in case
of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion (in case of no
reporting). For event based reporting, each instance of event, with the same
or different event identities, is counted as separate reporting criterion in
table 8.2.2-1.
The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to table 8.2.2-1. For the measurement categories
belonging to measurements on: E-UTRA intra-frequency cells, E-UTRA inter
frequency cells, and inter-RAT per supported RAT, the UE need not support more
than 21 reporting criteria in total.
Table 8.2.2-1: Requirements for reporting criteria per measurement category
* * *
Measurement category E~cat~ Note Intra-frequency 9 E-UTRA intra-frequency
cells Inter-frequency 7 E-UTRA inter-frequency cells Inter-RAT (E-UTRAN FDD or
TDD, UTRAN FDD, UTRAN TDD, GSM, cdma2000 1 x RTT and HRPD) 5 Only applicable
for UE with this (inter-RAT) capability. This requirement (**E~cat~** = 5) is
per supported RAT.
* * *
# 9 Measurements performance requirements for UE
One of the key services provided by the physical layer is the measurements
used to trigger or perform a multitude of functions. Both the UE and the
E-UTRAN are required to perform measurements. The physical layer measurement
model and a complete list of measurements are specified in [24] and [22]
respectively. The physical layer measurements are described and defined in
[4]. In this clause for each measurement the relevant requirements on the
measurement period, reporting range, granularity and performance in terms of
accuracy are specified.
Since the UE reference sensitivity requirements are different depending on
supported band, this is noted in each case with definition of the range Io for
each frequency band. Definitions of each frequency bands can be found in [5].
The accuracy requirements in this clause are applicable for AWGN radio
propagation conditions and assume independent interference (noise) at each
receiver antenna port.
## 9.1 E-UTRAN measurements
The requirements in this clause are applicable for a UE:
\- in state RRC_CONNECTED
\- performing measurements with appropriate measurement gaps as defined in
Section 8.1.2.1.
\- that is synchronised to the cell that is measured.
The reported measurement result after layer 1 filtering shall be an estimate
of the average value of the measured quantity over the measurement period. The
reference point for the measurement result after layer 1 filtering is referred
to as point B in the measurement model described in [24].
The accuracy requirements in this clause are valid for the reported
measurement result after layer 1 filtering. The accuracy requirements are
verified from the measurement report at point D in the measurement model
having the higher layer filtering disabled.
### 9.1.2 Intra-frequency RSRP Accuracy Requirements
#### 9.1.2.1 Absolute RSRP Accuracy
The absolute accuracy of RSRP is defined as the RSRP measured from a cell on
the same frequency as that of the serving cell.

## A.3.2 OFDMA Channel Noise Generator (OCNG)
### A.3.2.1 OCNG Patterns for FDD
The following OCNG patterns are used for modelling allocations to virtual UEs
(which are not under test) and/or allocations used for MBSFN. The OCNG pattern
for each sub frame specifies the allocations that shall be filled with OCNG,
and furthermore, the relative power level of each such allocation.
In each test case the OCNG is expressed by parameters OCNG_RA and OCNG_RB
which together with a relative power level ($\gamma$) specifies the PDSCH
EPRE-to-RS EPRE ratios in OFDM symbols without and with reference symbols,
respectively. The relative power, which is used for modelling boosting per
virtual UE allocation, is expressed by:
where $\gamma_{i}$ denotes the relative power level of the i:th virtual UE.
The parameter settings of OCNG_RA, OCNG_RB, and the set of relative power
levels $\gamma$are chosen such that when also taking allocations to the UE
under test into account, as given by a PDSCH reference channel, a constant
transmitted power spectral density that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is
targeted.
Moreover the OCNG pattern is accompanied by a PCFICH/PDCCH/PHICH reference
channel which specifies the control region. The number of PDCCH OFDM symbols
in the non-MBSFN subframes is the same as specified in the RMC used in the
test. The number of PDCCH OFDM symbols in the MBSFN subframe is the maximal
allowed according to 3GPP TS 36.213 [16]. For any aggregation and PHICH
allocation, the PDCCH and any unused PHICH groups are padded with resource
element groups with a power level given by PDCCH_RA/RB and PHICH_RA/RB as
specified in the test case such that a total power spectral density in the
control region that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is targeted.
The system information is scheduled in the allocations reserved for the OCNG
patterns, in the subframes not configured for MBSFN. For this purpose the
number of the RB-s allocated with PDSCH defined in the OCNG pattern can be
reduced as necessary.

Note 1: These physical resource blocks are assigned to an arbitrary number of virtual UEs with one PDSCH per virtual UE; the data transmitted over the OCNG PDSCHs shall be uncorrelated pseudo random data, which is QPSK modulated. The parameter _γ_ PRBis used to scale the power of PDSCH. Note 2: Each physical resource block (PRB) is assigned to MBSFN transmission. The data in each PRB shall be uncorrelated with data in other PRBs over the period of any measurement. The MBSFN data shall be QPSK modulated. PMCH symbols shall not contain cell-specific Reference Signals. PMCH subframes shall contain cell-specific Reference Signals only in the first symbol of the first time slot. The parameter _γ_ PRBis used to scale the power of PMCH. Note 3: If two or more transmit antennas with CRS are used in the test, the PDSCH part of OCNG shall be transmitted to the virtual users by all the transmit antennas with CRS and according to the antenna transmission mode 2. The parameter _γ_ PRB applies to each antenna port separately, so the transmit power of the PDSCH part of OCNG is equal between all the transmit antennas with CRS used in the test. The antenna transmission modes are specified in section 7.1 in 3GPP TS 36.213. Note 4: 0dB for 1 transmit antenna with CRS, +3dB for 2 transmit antennas with CRS N: Normal N/A: Not Applicable |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### A.3.2.2 OCNG Patterns for TDD
The following OCNG patterns are used for modelling allocations to virtual UEs
(which are not under test). The OCNG pattern for each sub frame specifies the
allocations that shall be filled with OCNG, and furthermore, the relative
power level of each such allocation.
In each test case the OCNG is expressed by parameters OCNG_RA and OCNG_RB
which together with a relative power level ($\gamma$) specifies the PDSCH
EPRE-to-RS EPRE ratios in OFDM symbols without and with reference symbols,
respectively. The relative power, which is used for modelling boosting per
virtual UE allocation, is expressed by:
where $\gamma_{i}$ denotes the relative power level of the i:th virtual UE.
The parameter settings of OCNG_RA, OCNG_RB, and the set of relative power
levels $\gamma$are chosen such that when also taking allocations to the UE
under test into account, as given by a PDSCH reference channel, a transmitted
power spectral density that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is targeted.
Moreover the OCNG pattern is accompanied by a PCFICH/PDCCH/PHICH reference
channel which specifies the control region. The number of PDCCH OFDM symbols
in the non-MBSFN subframes is the same as specified in the RMC used in the
test. The number of PDCCH OFDM symbols in the MBSFN subframe is the maximal
allowed according to 3GPP TS 36.213 [16]. For any aggregation and PHICH
allocation, the PDCCH and any unused PHICH groups are padded with resource
element groups with a power level given by PDCCH_RA/RB and PHICH_RA/RB as
specified in the test case such that a total power spectral density in the
control region that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is targeted.
The system information is scheduled in the allocations reserved for the OCNG
patterns, in the subframes not configured for MBSFN. For this purpose the
number of the RB-s allocated with PDSCH defined in the OCNG pattern can be
reduced as necessary.

#### A.4.2.1.2 Test Requirements
The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the time
from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell
2, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell shall be less than 34
s.
The cell reselection delay to an already detected cell is defined as the time
from the beginning of time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell
1, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay to an already detected cell shall be less than 8
s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell can be expressed
as: T~detect,EUTRAN_Intra~ + T~SI~, and to an already detected cell can be
expressed as: T~evaluateFDD,intra~ + T~SI~,
Where:
> T~detect,EUTRAN_Intra~ See Table 4.2.2.3-1 in section 4.2.2.3
>
> T~evaluateFDD,intra~ See Table 4.2.2.3-1 in section 4.2.2.3
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 33.28 s, allow 34 s for the cell re-selection delay to a
newly detectable cell and 7.68 s, allow 8 s for the cell re-selection delay to
an already detected cell in the test case.

#### A.4.2.3.2 Test Requirements
The cell reselection delay to higher priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 2, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay to higher priority shall be less than 68 s.
The cell reselection delay to lower priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T1, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 1, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay to lower priority shall be less than 8 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to higher priority cell can be expressed as:
**T~higher_priority_search~** \+ T~evaluateFDD,inter~ + T~SI~ , and to lower
priority cell can be expressed as: T~evaluateFDD,inter~ + T~SI~,
Where:
> **T~higher_priority_search~ See section 4.2.2**
>
> T~evaluateFDD,inter~ See Table 4.2.2.4-1 in section 4.2.2.4
>
> T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
> be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this test
> case.
This gives a total of 67.68 s for higher priority cell search and 7.68 s for
lower priority cell search, allow 68 s for higher priority cell and 8 s for
lower priority cell in the test case.

#### A.4.3.3.2 Test Requirements
The cell reselection delay to lower priority is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on cell 2, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message on cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay to lower priority shall be less than 21 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to lower priority cell can be expressed as:
T~evaluateUTRA_FDD~ + T~SI-UTRA~
Where:
> T~evaluateUTRA-FDD~ See Table 4.2.2.5.1-1
>
> T~SI-UTRA~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
> needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this
> test case.
This gives a total of 20.48 s for lower priority cell reselection, allow 21 s.

## A.4.4 E-UTRAN to GSM Cell Re-Selection
### A.4.4.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- GSM:
#### A.4.4.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to GSM cell re-
selection delay reported in section 4.2.2.5.
This scenario implies the presence of 1 E-UTRAN serving cell, and 1 GSM cell
to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1
E-UTRA carrier and 12 GSM cells. Test parameters are given in Table,
A.4.4.1-1, A.4.4.1-2, A.4.4.1-3. E-UTRA FDD cell (Cell 1) and GSM cell (cell
2) shall belong to different Location Areas. The test comprises two successive
time periods, T1 and T2. During initialization before the start of the test,
the UE is camped on cell 1. By the end of T1, the UE has identified BSIC on
the GSM BCCH carrier of cell 2 but the signal levels do not meet the
reselection criterion during T1. At the start of T2, the signal levels change
such that cell 2 satisfies reselection criterion. The GSM layer is configured
at a lower priority than the serving E-UTRA FDD layer.

### A.5.1.2.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 50 ms from the
beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay **= 15 ms and is specified in section 11.2 in [2].**
**T~interrupt~** = 35 ms in the test; **T~interrupt~** is defined in section
5.2.2.4.2.
This gives a total of 50 ms.
## A.5.1.3 E-UTRAN FDD -- FDD Inter frequency handover
### A.5.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the FDD-FDD inter-frequency
handover requirements specified in section 5.1.2.1.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA FDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.5.1.3.1-1 and A.5.1.3.1-2. PDCCHs indicating new
transmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would not
enter the DRX state. The test consists of three successive time periods, with
time durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration
T1, the UE does not have any timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2
becomes detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement
report. Gap pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1
is configured before T2 begins to enable inter-frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event A3. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE.

### A.5.1.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 50 ms from the
beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay **= 15 ms and is specified in section 11.2 in [2].**
**T~interrupt~** = 35 ms in the test; **T~interrupt~** is defined in section
5.1.2.1.2.
This gives a total of 50 ms.
## A.5.1.4 E-UTRAN TDD -- TDD Inter frequency handover
### A.5.1.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the TDD-TDD inter frequency
handover requirements specified in section 5.2.2.4.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA TDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables Table A.5.1.4.1-1 and Table A.5.1.4.1-2. PDCCHs
indicating new transmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE
would not enter the DRX state. The test consists of three successive time
periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of
time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.
E-UTRAN shall send a RRC message implying handover to cell 2. The RRC message
implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after the UE has
reported Event A3.

### A.5.1.5 E-UTRAN FDD -- FDD Inter frequency handover: unknown target cell
#### A.5.1.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the FDD-FDD inter-frequency handover requirements for
the case when the target cell is unknown as specified in section 5.1.2.1.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA FDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.5.1.5.1-1 and A.5.1.5.1-2. No gap patterns are
configured in the test case. The test consists of two successive time periods,
with time durations of T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration
T1, the UE does not have any timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2
becomes detectable and the UE is expected to detect and start to transmit the
PRACH to Cell 2.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T1. The
start of T2 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC message
implying handover is sent to the UE.

### A.5.1.5.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 130 ms from the
beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**_T~interrupt~_** , where:
RRC procedure delay = 15 ms, which is specified in **section 11.2 in [2].**
**_T~interrupt~_** = 115 ms in the test. See section 5.1.2.1.2
This gives a total of 130 ms.
### A.5.1.6 E-UTRAN TDD -- TDD Inter frequency handover; unknown Target Cell
#### A.5.1.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the TDD-TDD inter-frequency handover requirements for
the case when the target cell is unknown as specified in section 5.2.2.4.
The test scenario comprises of two E-UTRA TDD carriers and one cell on each
carrier as given in tables A.5.1.6.1-1 and A.5.1.6.1-2. No gap patterns are
configured in the test case. The test consists of two successive time periods,
with time durations of T1, T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1,
the UE does not have any timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2
becomes detectable and the UE receives a RRC handover command from the
network. The start of T2 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying handover is sent to the UE.

## A.5.2 E-UTRAN Handover to other RATs
### A.5.2.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- UTRAN FDD Handover
#### A.5.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to UTRAN FDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.3.1.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.2.1.1-1, A.5.2.1.1-2 and
A.5.2.1.1-3. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap
pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured
before T2 begins to enable inter-RAT frequency monitoring.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event B2. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. The
handover message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

### A.5.2.2 E-UTRAN TDD - UTRAN FDD Handover
#### A.5.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the E-UTRAN TDD -- UTRAN FDD handover requirements
specified in section 5.3.1.
The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRAN TDD cell and one UTRAN FDD cell as
given in the tables A.5.2.2.1-1, A5.2.2.1-2 and A.5.2.2.1-3. The test consists
of three successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any timing
information of cell 2. Gap pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in
Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured before the start of T2 to enable the monitoring
of UTRAN FDD. A neighbouring cell list, including the UTRAN cell (cell2),
shall be sent to the UE before T2 starts. During the time T2 cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send the measurement report. A
RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during T2, after the UE
has reported event B2. The start of T3 is the instant when the last TTI
containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. The handover
message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

##### A.5.2.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall begin to send access bursts on the new DCCH of the target cell
less than 100 ms from the beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The test requirement in this test case is expressed as:
T~Handover\ delay~ = 90 ms (Table 5.3.3.2.1-1) + T~offset~ + T~UL~
T~offset~ : Equal to 4.65 ms, GSM timing uncertainty between the time from
when the UE is ready to transmit until the start of the next timeslot in GSM
26 multiframe structure
T~UL~: Equal to 4.65 ms, the time the UE has to wait in case the next timeslot
is an idle frame or a SACCH frame.
This gives a total of 99.3 ms, allow 100 ms in the test case.

###### A.5.2.5.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to UTRAN TDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.3.2.
The test scenario comprises of two cells, E-UTRA TDD cell1 and UTRA TDD cell2.
The test consists of three successive time periods, with time durations of T1,
T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have
any timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes detectable and
the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap pattern
configuration with id #1 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured before
T2 begins to enable inter-RAT frequency monitoring. The test parameters are
given in Tables A.5.2.5.1-1, A.5.2.5.1-2 and A.5.2.5.1-3.
A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2,
after the UE has reported Event B2. The start of T3 is the instant when the
last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE. The
handover message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

##### A.5.2.5.2.1 Void
##### A.5.2.5.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option
The UE shall start to transmit the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS to Cell 2
less than 120 ms from the beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay **= 50 ms, which is specified in section** 5.3.2.2.1**.**
**T~interrupt~** is defined in section 5.3.2.2.2. **T~interrupt~** = 70 ms in
the test as following:
T~interrupt1~= T~offset~+T~UL~+30*F~SFN~+20 +10*F~max~ ms
T~offset~ = 10 ms; T~UL~ = 10 ms; and F~SFN~ = 1 for UE decoding SFN; F~max~ =
0 for SYNCH-UL sequence transmition.

##### A.5.2.5.2.3 Void
#### A.5.2.6 E-UTRAN TDD - GSM Handover
##### A.5.2.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN to GSM cell handover
delay specified in section 5.3.3.
The test parameters are given in Table A.5.2.6.1-1, A.5.2.6.1-2 and
A.5.2.6.1-3 below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event B1 shall be used. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing
information of cell 2.
The RRC message implying handover to cell 2 shall be sent to the UE during
period T2, after the UE has reported Event B1. The start of T3 is defined as
the end of last E-UTRAN TTI containing the RRC message implying handover.
The requirements are also applicable for a UE not requiring measurement gap,
in which case no measurement gap pattern should be sent for the parameters
specified in Table A.5.2.6.1-1.

less than 200 ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The test requirement in this test case is expressed as:
T~Handover\ delay~ = 190 ms (Table 5.3.3.2.1-1) + T~offset~ + T~UL~
T~offset~: Equal to 4.65 ms is the GSM timing uncertainty from the time when
the UE is ready to transmit until the start of the next timeslot in GSM 26
multiframe structure
T~UL~: Equal to 4.65 ms is the time the UE has to wait in case the next
timeslot is an idle frame or a SACCH frame.
This gives a total of 199.3 ms, allow 200 ms in the test case.
### A.5.2.9 E-UTRAN TDD - GSM Handover; Unknown Target Cell
#### A.5.2.9.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the E-UTRAN TDD to GSM handover requirements for the
case when the target GSM cell is unknown as specified in section 5.3.3.
The test parameters are given in Table A.5.2.9.1 -1, A.5.2.9.1 -2 and
A.5.2.9.1 -3 below. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE
will not have any timing information of cell 2. Starting T2, cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE receives a RRC handover command from the network. The
start of T2 is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC message
implying handover is sent to the UE. No Gap pattern configuration shall be
used.

#### A.5.2.10.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS to Cell 2
less than 280 ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The handover delay can be expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
**T~interrupt~** , where:
RRC procedure delay = 50 ms, which is specified in section 5.3.2.2.1.
**T~interrupt~** is defined in section 5.3.2.2.2. **T~interrupt~** = 230 ms in
the test as following:
T~interrupt1~= T~offset~+T~UL~+30*F~SFN~+180 +10*F~max~ ms
T~offset~ = 10 ms; T~UL~ = 10 ms; and F~SFN~ = 1 for UE decoding SFN; F~max~ =
0 for SYNCH-UL sequence transmition.
This gives a total of 280 ms.
#### A.5.3 E-UTRAN Handover to Non-3GPP RATs
#### A.5.3.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- HRPD Handover
#### A.5.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to HRPD handover
requirements specified in section 5.4.1.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3.1.1-1, A.5.3.1.1-2 and
A.5.3.1.1-3. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes
detectable and the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report. Gap
pattern configuration with id #0 as specified in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is configured

#### A.5.3.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the E-UTRAN FDD to HRPD handover
requirements for the case when the target HRPD cell is unknown as specified in
section 5.4.1.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3.3.1-1, A.5.3.3.1-2 and
A.5.3.3.1-3. The test consists of two successive time periods, with time
durations of T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE
does not have any timing information of cell 2. During time period T1, message
containing Information Element _systemTimeInfo_ as defined in section 6.3.1 of
TS 36.331 [2] shall be sent by the System Simulator (SS). No gap patterns are
configured in the test case. No HRPD neighbour cell list shall be provided to
the UE.
A RRC message implying handover to the unknown HRPD cell shall be sent to the
UE towards the end of the time period T1. The start of T2 is the instant when
the last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE.
The handover message shall contain cell 2 as the target cell.

#### A.6.1.1.2 Test Requirements
The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of time
period T3, to the moment when the UE starts to send PRACH preambles to cell 2
for sending the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message to cell 2.
The RRC re-establishment delay to a known E-UTRA FDD intra frequency cell
shall be less than 1.5 s.
The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.
NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the following
expression:
T~re-establish_delay~= T~UL_grant~ + T~UE_re-establish_delay~.
Where:
T~UL_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from
the target cell. The PRACH reception at the system simulator is used as a
trigger for the completion of the test; hence T~UL_grant~ is not used.
T~UE_re-establish_delay~ = 50 ms + N~freq~* _T~search~_ \+ T~SI~ + T~PRACH~
N~freq~ = 1
_T~search~_ = 100 ms
T~SI~ _= 1280 ms; it is the_ time required for receiving all the relevant
system information as defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 for the target E-UTRAN FDD
cell.
T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.
This gives a total of 1445 ms, allow 1.5 s in the test case.
### A.6.1.2 E-UTRAN FDD Inter-frequency RRC Re-establishment
#### A.6.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose is to verify that the E-UTRA FDD inter-frequency RRC re-
establishment delay is within the specified limits. These tests will verify
the requirements in section 6.1.2.
The test parameters are given in table A.6.1.1.2-1 and table A.6.1.1.2-2
below. The test consists of 3 successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is
the active cell, is deactivated. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of radio link failure. At the start of time period T3, cell 2,
which is the neighbour cell, is activated.

#### A.6.1.3.2 Test Requirements
The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of time
period T3, to the moment when the UE starts to send PRACH preambles to cell 2
for sending the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message to cell 2.
The RRC re-establishment delay to a known E-UTRA TDD intra frequency cell
shall be less than 1.5 s.
The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.
NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the following
expression:
T~re-establish_delay~= T~UL_grant~ + T~UE_re-establish_delay~.
Where:
T~UL_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from
the target cell. The PRACH reception at the system simulator is used as a
trigger for the completion of the test; hence T~UL_grant~ is not used.
T~UE_re-establish_delay~ = 50 ms + N~freq~* _T~search~_ \+ T~SI~ + T~PRACH~
N~freq~ = 1
_T~search~_ = 100 ms
T~SI~ _= 1280 ms; it is the_ time required for receiving all the relevant
system information as defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 for the target E-UTRAN TDD
cell.
T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.
This gives a total of 1445 ms, allow 1.5 s in the test case.
### A.6.1.4 E-UTRAN TDD Inter-frequency RRC Re-establishment
#### A.6.1.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose is to verify that the E-UTRA TDD inter-frequency RRC re-
establishment delay is within the specified limits. These tests will verify
the requirements in section 6.1.2.
The test parameters are given in table A.6.1.4.1-1 and table A.6.1.4.1-2
below. The test consists of 3 successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is
the active cell, is deactivated. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of radio link failure. At the start of time period T3, cell 2,
which is the neighbour cell, is activated.

#### A.6.1.4.2 Test Requirements
The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of time
period T3, to the moment when the UE starts to send PRACH preambles to cell 2
for sending the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message to cell 2.
The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown E-UTRA TDD inter frequency cell
shall be less than 3 s.
The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.
NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the following
expression:
T~re-establish_delay~= T~UL_grant~ + T~UE_re-establish_delay~.
Where:
T~UL_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink grant from
the target cell. The PRACH reception at the system simulator is used as a
trigger for the completion of the test; hence T~UL_grant~ is not used.
T~UE_re-establish_delay~ = 50 ms + N~freq~* _T~search~_ \+ T~SI~ + T~PRACH~
N~freq~ = 2
_T~search~_ = 800 ms
T~SI~ _= 1280 ms; it is the_ time required for receiving all the relevant
system information as defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 for the target E-UTRAN TDD
cell.
T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random access

A.6.2.1.2 Test Requirements
Contention based random access is triggered by _not_ explicitly assigning a
random access preamble via dedicated signalling in the downlink.
#### A.6.2.1.2.1 Random Access Response Reception
To test the UE behavior specified in Subclause 6.2.2.1.1 the System Simulator
shall transmit a Random Access Response containing a Random Access Preamble
identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble after 5
preambles have been received by the System Simulator. In response to the first
4 preambles, the System Simulator shall transmit a Random Access Response
_not_ corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble.
The UE may stop monitoring for Random Access Response(s) and shall transmit
the msg3 if the Random Access Response contains a Random Access Preamble
identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble.
The UE shall re-select a preamble and transmit with the calculated PRACH
transmission power when the backoff time expires if all received Random Access
Responses contain Random Access Preamble identifiers that do not match the
transmitted Random Access Preamble.
In addition, the power applied to all preambles shall be in accordance with
what is specified in Subclause 6.2.2. The power of the first preamble shall be
-30 dBm. The power of the first preamble shall be -30 dBm with an accuracy
specified in section 6.3.5.1.1 of 3GPP TS 36.101 [5]. The relative power
applied to additional preambles shall have an accuracy specified in section
6.3.5.2.1 of 3GPP TS 36.101 [5].
The transmit timing of all PRACH transmissions shall be within the accuracy
specified in Subclause 7.1.2.
#### A.6.2.1.2.2 No Random Access Response Reception
To test the UE behavior specified in subclause 6.2.2.1.2 the System Simulator
shall transmit a Random Access Response containing a Random Access Preamble
identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble after 5
preambles have been received by the System Simulator. The System Simulator
shall _not_ respond to the first 4 preambles.
The UE shall re-select a preamble and transmit with the calculated PRACH
transmission power when the backoff time expires if no Random Access Response
is received within the RA Response window.
In addition, the power applied to all preambles shall be in accordance with
what is specified in Subclause 6.2.2. The power of the first preamble shall be
-30 dBm with an accuracy specified in section 6.3.5.1.1 of 3GPP TS 36.101 [5].
The relative power applied to additional preambles shall have an accuracy
specified in section 6.3.5.2.1 of 3GPP TS 36.101 [5].
The transmit timing of all PRACH transmissions shall be within the accuracy
specified in Subclause 7.1.2.
#### A.6.2.1.2.3 Receiving a NACK on msg3
To test the UE behavior specified in subclause 6.2.2.1.3 the System Simulator
shall NACK _all_ UE msg3 following a successful Random Access Response.
The UE shall re-transmit the msg3 upon the reception of a NACK on msg3 until
the maximum number of HARQ re-transmissions is reached.
##### A.6.2.1.2.4 Reception of an Incorrect Message over Temporary C-RNTI
To test the UE behavior specified in Subclause 6.2.2.1.5 the System Simulator
shall send a message addressed to the temporary C-RNTI with a UE Contention
Resolution Identity included in the MAC control element _not_ matching the
CCCH SDU transmitted in msg3 uplink message.
The UE shall re-select a preamble and transmit with the calculated PRACH
transmission power when the backoff time expires unless the received message
includes a UE Contention Resolution Identity MAC control element and the UE
Contention Resolution Identity included in the MAC control element matches the
CCCH SDU transmitted in the uplink message.
##### A.6.2.1.2.5 Reception of a Correct Message over Temporary C-RNTI
To test the UE behavior specified in Subclause 6.2.2.1.5 the System Simulator
shall send a message addressed to the temporary C-RNTI with a UE Contention
Resolution Identity included in the MAC control element matching the CCCH SDU
transmitted in the msg3 uplink message.
The UE shall send ACK if the Contention Resolution is successful.
##### A.6.2.1.2.6 Contention Resolution Timer expiry
To test the UE behavior specified in Subclause 6.2.2.1.6 the System Simulator
shall _not_ send a response to a msg3.
The UE shall re-select a preamble and transmit with the calculated PRACH
transmission power when the backoff time expires if the Contention Resolution
Timer expires.
#### A.6.2.2 E-UTRAN FDD -- Non-Contention Based Random Access Test
#### A.6.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the behavior of the random access
procedure is according to the requirements and that the PRACH power settings
and timing are within specified limits. This test will verify the requirements
in Section 6.2.2 and Section 7.1.2 in an AWGN model.
For this test a single cell is used. The test parameters are given in tables

#### A.7.2 UE Timing Advance
#### A.7.2.1 E-UTRAN FDD -- UE Timing Advance Adjustment Accuracy Test
#### A.7.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of the test is to verify E-UTRAN FDD Timing Advance adjustment
accuracy requirements, defined in section 7.3.2.2, in an AWGN model.
The test parameters are given in tables A.7.2.1.1-1, A.7.2.1.1-2, and
A.7.2.1.1-3. The test consists of two successive time periods, with time
duration of T1 and T2 respectively. In each time period, timing advance
commands are sent to the UE and Sounding Reference Signals (SRS), as specified
in table A.7.2.1.1-3, are sent from the UE and received by the test equipment.
By measuring the reception of the SRS, the transmit timing, and hence the
timing advance adjustment accuracy, can be measured.
During time period T1, the test equipment shall send one message with a Timing
Advance Command MAC Control Element, as specified in Section 6.1.3.5 in TS
36.321. The Timing Advance Command value shall be set to 31, which according
to Section 4.2.3 in TS 36.213 results in zero adjustment of the Timing
Advance. In this way, a reference value for the timing advance used by the UE
is established.
During time period T2, the test equipment shall send a sequence of messages
with Timing Advance Command MAC Control Elements, with Timing Advance Command
value specified in table A.7.2.1.1-2. This value shall result in changes of
the timing advance used by the UE, and the accuracy of the change shall then
be measured, using the SRS sent from the UE.
As specified in Section 7.3.2.1, the UE adjusts its uplink timing at sub-frame
n+6 for a timing advance command received in sub-frame n. This delay must be
taken into account when measuring the timing advance adjustment accuracy, via
the SRS sent from the UE.
The UE Time Alignment Timer, described in Section 5.2 in TS 36.321, shall be
configured so that it does not expire in the duration of the test.

#### A.7.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of the test is to verify E-UTRAN TDD Timing Advance adjustment
accuracy requirements, defined in section 7.3.2.2, in an AWGN model.
The test parameters are given in tables A.7.2.2.1-1, A.7.2.2.1-2, and
A.7.2.2.1-3. The test consists of two successive time periods, with time
duration of T1 and T2 respectively. In each time period, timing advance

By measuring the reception of the SRS, the transmit timing, and hence the
timing advance adjustment accuracy, can be measured.
During time period T1, the test equipment shall send one message with a Timing
Advance Command MAC Control Element, as specified in Section 6.1.3.5 in TS
36.321. The Timing Advance Command value shall be set to 31, which according
to Section 4.2.3 in TS 36.213 results in zero adjustment of the Timing

is established.
During time period T2, the test equipment shall send a sequence of messages

value specified in table A.7.2.1.1-2. This value shall result in changes of
the timing advance used by the UE, and the accuracy of the change shall then
be measured, using the SRS sent from the UE.
As specified in Section 7.3.2.1, the UE adjusts its uplink timing at sub-frame
n+6 for a timing advance command received in sub-frame n. This delay must be
taken into account when measuring the timing advance adjustment accuracy, via

#### A.7.2.2.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall apply the signalled Timing Advance value to the transmission
timing at the designated activation time i.e. 6 sub frames after the reception
of the timing advance command.
The Timing Advance adjustment accuracy shall be within the limits specified in
section 7.3.2.2.
## A.7.3 Radio Link Monitoring
In the following section, any uplink signal transmitted by the UE is used for
detecting the In-/Out-of-Sync state of the UE. In terms of measurement, the
uplink signal is verified on the basis of the UE output power:
> \- UE output power higher than Transmit OFF power -50 dBm (as defined in TS
> 36.101 [5] clause 6.3.3.1) means uplink signal
>
> \- UE output power equal to or less than Transmit OFF power -50 dBm (as
> defined in TS 36.101 [5] clause 6.3.3.1) means no uplink signal
### A.7.3.1 E-UTRAN FDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for Out-of-sync
#### A.7.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN FDD radio link
monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.1.1-1, A.7.3.1.1-2 and
A.7.3.1.1-3 below. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in
the test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure A.7.3.1.1-4 shows the variation
of the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync
states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting
in PUCCH 1-0 mode with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms.

Figure A.7.3.1.1-4 SNR variation for out-of-sync testing
#### A.7.3.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3 shall be as
follows:
During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall transmit
uplink signal at least in all subframes configured for CQI transmission
according the configured CQI reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
The UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time point C (240ms
after the start of time duration T3).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.

### A.7.3.2 E-UTRAN FDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for In-sync
#### A.7.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN FDD radio link
monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.2.1-1 and A.7.3.2.1-2 below.
There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the test. The test
consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 respectively. Figure A.7.3.2.1-3 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the
start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized to cell 1.
The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0 mode with a
reporting periodicity of 2 ms.

Note 1: OCNG shall be used such that the resources in cell # 1 are fully allocated and a constant total transmitted power spectral density is achieved for all OFDM symbols. Note 2: The uplink resources for CQI reporting are assigned to the UE prior to the start of time period T1. Note 3: The timers and layer 3 filtering related parameters are configured prior to the start of time period T1. Note 4: The signal contains PDCCH for UEs other than the device under test as part of OCNG. Note 5: SNR levels correspond to the signal to noise ratio over the cell-specific reference signal REs. Note 6: The SNR in time periods T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 is denoted as SNR1, SNR2, SNR3, SNR4 and SNR5 respectively in figure A.7.3.2.1-3. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Figure A.7.3.2.1-3 SNR variation for in-sync testing
#### A.7.3.2.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
shall be as follows:
During the period from time point A to time point F (420 ms after the start of
time duration T5) the UE shall transmit uplink signal at least in all
subframes configured for CQI transmission according to the configured CQI
reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.3 E-UTRAN TDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for Out-of-sync
#### A.7.3.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD radio link
monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.3.1-1, A.7.3.3.1-2 and
A.7.3.3.1-3 below. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in
the test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure A.7.3.3.1-4 shows the variation
of the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync
states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting
in PUCCH 1-0 mode with a reporting periodicity of 1 ms.

Figure A.7.3.3.1-4. SNR variation for out-of-sync testing
#### A.7.3.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3 shall be as
follows:
During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall transmit
uplink signal at least in all uplink subframes configured for CQI transmission
according to the configured CQI reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
The UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time point C (240ms
after the start of the time duration T3).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
[]{.underline}
### A.7.3.4 E-UTRAN TDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for In-sync
#### A.7.3.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD radio link
monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.4.1-1 and A.7.3.4.1-2 below.
There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the test. The test
consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 respectively. Figure A.7.3.4.1-3 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the
start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized to cell 1.
The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0 mode with a
reporting periodicity of 1 ms.

Note 1: For the special subframe configuration see table 4.2-1 in 3GPP TS 36.211. Note 2: For the uplink-downlink configuration see table 4.2-2 in 3GPP TS 36.211. Note 3: OCNG shall be used such that the resources in cell # 1 are fully allocated and a constant total transmitted power spectral density is achieved for all OFDM symbols. Note 4: The uplink resources for CQI reporting are assigned to the UE prior to the start of time period T1. Note 5: The timers and layer 3 filtering related parameters are configured prior to the start of time period T1. Note 6: The signal contains PDCCH for UEs other than the device under test as part of OCNG. Note 7: SNR levels correspond to the signal to noise ratio over the cell-specific reference signal REs. Note 8: The SNR in time periods T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 is denoted as SNR1, SNR2, SNR3, SNR4 and SNR5 respectively in figure A.7.3.4.1-3. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Figure A.7.3.4.1-3. SNR variation for in-sync testing
#### A.7.3.4.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
shall be as follows:
During the period from time point A to time point F (420 ms after the start of
time duration T5) the UE shall transmit uplink signal at least in all uplink
subframes configured for CQI transmission according to the configured CQI
reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.5 E-UTRAN FDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for Out-of-sync in DRX
#### A.7.3.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell when DRX is used. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN
FDD radio link monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.5.1-1, A.7.3.5.1-2, A.7.3.5.1-3
and A.7.3.5.1-4. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the
test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure A.7.3.5.1-5 shows the variation of the
downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized
to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0
mode with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is
enabled and DRX inactivity timer has already been expired, i.e. UE tries to
decode PDCCH and to send periodic CQI during the period when On-duration timer
is running. Time alignment timers shall be set to "infinity" so that UL timing
alignment is maintained during the test.

Figure A.7.3.5.1-5 SNR variation for out-of-sync testing in DRX
#### A.7.3.5.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3 shall be as
follows:
In test 1 and test 2 during the period from time point A to time point B the
UE shall transmit uplink signal at least once every DRX cycle, in the On-
duration part of the cycle in the subframe according the configured CQI
reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
In test 1 the UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (duration D~1~ = 900 ms after the start of time duration T3).
In test 2 the UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (duration D~1~ = 6500 ms after the start of time duration T3).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.6 E-UTRAN FDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for In-sync in DRX
#### A.7.3.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell when DRX is used. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN
FDD radio link monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.6.1-1, A.7.3.6.1-2, A.7.3.6.1-3
and A.7.3.6.1-4. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the
test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure A.7.3.6.1-5 shows the variation of
the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized
to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0
mode with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is
enabled and DRX inactivity timer has already been expired, i.e. UE tries to
decode PDCCH and to send periodic CQI during the period when On-duration timer
is running. Time alignment timers shall be set to "infinity" so that UL timing
alignment is maintained during the test.

Figure A.7.3.6.1-5 SNR variation for in-sync testing in DRX
#### A.7.3.6.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
shall be as follows:
During the time duration T1 to T5 the UE shall transmit uplink signal at least
once every DRX cycle, in the On-duration part of the cycle in the subframe
according the configured CQI reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### A.7.3.7 E-UTRAN TDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for Out-of-sync in DRX
#### A.7.3.7.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell when DRX is used. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN
TDD radio link monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.7.1-1, A.7.3.7.1-2, A.7.3.7.1-3
and A.7.3.7.1-4. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the
test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure A.7.3.7.1-5 shows the variation of the
downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized
to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0
mode with a reporting periodicity of 1 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is
enabled and DRX inactivity timer has already been expired, i.e. UE tries to
decode PDCCH and to send periodic CQI during the period when On-duration timer
is running. Time alignment timers shall be set to "infinity" so that UL timing
alignment is maintained during the test.

Figure A.7.3.7.1-5 SNR variation for out-of-sync testing in DRX
#### A.7.3.7.2 Test Requirements
The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3 shall be as
follows:
In test 1 and test 2 during the period from time point A to time point B the
UE shall transmit uplink signal at least once every DRX cycle, in the On-
duration part of the cycle in the uplink subframe according to the configured
CQI reporting mode (PUCCH 1-0).
In test 1 the UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (duration D~1~ = 900 ms after the start of time duration T3).
In test 2 the UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (duration D~1~ = 6500 ms after the start of time duration T3).
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
### **A.7.3.8 E-UTRAN TDD Radio Link Monitoring Test for In-sync in DRX**
#### A.7.3.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the out of
sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell when DRX is used. This test will partly verify the E-UTRAN
TDD radio link monitoring requirements in section 7.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.3.8.1-1, A.7.3.8.1-2, A.7.3.8.1-3
and A.7.3.8.1-4. There is one cell (cell 1), which is the active cell, in the
test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure A.7.3.8.1-5 shows the variation of
the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized
to cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CQI reporting in PUCCH 1-0
mode with a reporting periodicity of 1 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is
enabled and DRX inactivity timer has already been expired, i.e. UE tries to
decode PDCCH and to send periodic CQI during the period when On-duration timer
is running. Time alignment timers shall be set to "infinity" so that UL timing

#### A.8.1.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time period
T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTI~DCCH~
higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI insertion
uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.1.2 E-UTRAN FDD-FDD intra-frequency event triggered reporting under
fading propagation conditions in synchronous cells
#### A.8.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event. This test will partly verify the FDD intra-frequency cell search
requirements in section 8.1.2.2.1.1
The test parameters are given in Table A.8.1.2.1-1 and A.8.1.2.1-2 below. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. PDCCHs indicating new transmissions
or retransmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would not
enter the DRX state. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time duration T1, the UE
shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.1.2.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time period
T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTI~DCCH~
higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI insertion
uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.1.3 E-UTRAN FDD-FDD intra-frequency event triggered reporting under
fading propagation conditions in synchronous cells with DRX
#### A.8.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of the two tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting
of an event in DRX. The tests will partly verify the FDD-FDD intra-frequency
cell search in DRX requirements in section 8.1.2.2.1.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.1.3.1-1, A.8.1.3.1-2, A.8.1.3.1-3
and A.8.1.3.1-4. In the measurement control information, it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively.
During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell
2.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer to
keep UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource
at every DRX cycle.
In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE needs to use RACH
to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.

#### A.8.1.3.2 Test Requirements
In Test 1, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time period
T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2 to the moment when the UE send the measurement report on
PUSCH.
In Test 2, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 25600 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2 to the moment when the UE starts to send preambles
on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to send the
measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report.

#### A.8.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event. This test will partly verify the TDD intra-frequency cell search
requirements in section 8.1.2.2.2.1.
The test parameters are given in Table A.8.2.1.1-1 and A.8.2.1.1-2 below. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. PDCCHs indicating new transmissions
or retransmissions should be sent continuously to ensure that the UE would not
enter the DRX state. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time duration T1, the UE
shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.1.3.1-1, A.8.1.3.1-2, A.8.1.3.1-3
and A.8.1.3.1-4. In the measurement control information, it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively.
During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell
2.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle.
In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE needs to use RACH
to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.

#### A.8.2.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test 1, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time period
T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2 to the moment when the UE send the measurement report on
PUSCH.
In Test 2, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 25600 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2 to the moment when the UE starts to send preambles
on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to send the
measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report.

#### A.8.3.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 3840 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send the measurement
report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 20*1280ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report
### A.8.3.3 E-UTRAN FDD-FDD inter-frequency event triggered reporting under
AWGN propagation conditions in asynchronous cells with DRX when L3 filtering
is used
#### A.8.3.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX when L3 filtering is used. This test will partly verify the
FDD-FDD inter-frequency cell search in DRX requirements in section 8.1.2.3.1.2
and the UE behaviour with the _filterCoefficent_ defined in [2].
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.3.3.1-1, A.8.3.3.1-2, A.8.3.3.1-3
and A.8.3.3.1-4. In the measurement control information, it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 and the filter coefficient
is used. The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, and T2 respectively. In this test, there are two cells on different
carrier frequencies and gap pattern configuration # 1 as defined in Table
8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE needs to use RACH to obtain
UL allocation for measurement reporting.

### A.8.4.2 E-UTRAN TDD-TDD Inter-frequency event triggered reporting when DRX
is used under fading propagation conditions in synchronous cells
#### A.8.4.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These test will partly verify the TDD-TDD inter-frequency
cell search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.3.
The common test parameters are given in Tables A.8.4.2.1-1 and A.8.4.2.1-2.
DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table A.8.4.2.1-3 and time
alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters in Table
A.8.4.2.1-4. In these tests, there are two cells on different carrier
frequencies and gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is
provided.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time aligmend. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The tests consists of two
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During
time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.4.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 3840 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send the measurement
report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 20*1280ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event A3 measurement report
### A.8.4.3 E-UTRAN TDD-TDD inter-frequency event triggered reporting under
AWGN propagation conditions in synchronous cells with DRX when L3 filtering is
used
#### A.8.4.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX when L3 filtering is used. This test will partly verify the
TDD-TDD inter-frequency cell search in DRX requirements in section 8.1.2.3.2.2
and the UE behaviour with the filterCoefficent defined in [2].
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.4.3.1-1, A.8.4.3.1-2, A.8.4.3.1-3
and A.8.4.3.1-4. In the measurement control information, it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 and the filter coefficient
is used. The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, and T2 respectively. In this test, there are two cells on different
carrier frequencies and gap pattern configuration # 1 as defined in Table
8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The uplink time alignment is not maintained and UE needs to use RACH to obtain
UL allocation for measurement reporting.

#### A.8.5.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 4800 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
> NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
> 2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of
> TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
### A.8.5.2 E-UTRAN FDD - UTRAN FDD SON ANR cell search reporting under AWGN
propagation conditions
#### A.8.5.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
the strongest UTRAN cell for SON automatic neighbour relations. This test will
partly verify the E-UTRAN FDD - UTRAN FDD cell search requirements for
identification of a new UTRA FDD cell for SON given in section 8.1.2.4.7.1.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.5.2.1-1, A.8.5.2.1-2 and
A.8.5.2.1-3 below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to
the UE that periodical reporting with the purpose 'reportStrongestCellsForSON'
is used. The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, and T2 respectively. Prior to the start of time period T1, an
interRATperiodic measurement reporting configuration with purpose
reportStrongestCellsForSON is configured, and linked to a UTRA measurement
object corresponding to channel UARFCN 1. During time duration T1, the UE
shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.5.2.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send the first measurement report containing the primary
scrambling code of cell 2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 4800
ms from the beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct measurement reports observed with this delay during
repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

### A.8.5.3 E-UTRAN FDD-UTRAN FDD event triggered reporting when DRX is used
under fading propagation conditions
#### A.8.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These tests will partly verify the E-UTRAN FDD-UTRAN FDD cell
search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.4.1.2.
In these tests, there are two cells, one E-UTRAN cell and one UTRAN cell, and
gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The common test parameters are given in Table A.8.5.3.1-1. Cell specific test
parameters are given in Table A.8.5.3.1-2 for E-UTRAN and in Table A.8.5.3.1-5
for UTRAN. DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table
A.8.5.2.1-3 and time alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters
in Table A.8.5.2.1-4.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time alignment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event B1 is used. The tests consist of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.5.3.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 2400 ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE sends the measurement
report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 20*1280ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event B1 measurement report

#### A.8.7.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These tests will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD to UTRAN TDD
inter-RAT cell search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.4.3.2
under fading propagation conditions.
The common test parameters are given in Tables A.8.7.2.1-1, A.8.7.2.1-2 and
A.8.7.2.1-3. DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table
A.8.7.2.1-4 and time alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters
in Table A.8.7.2.1-5. In these tests, there are two cells, 1 E-UTRAN TDD
serving cell and 1 UTRAN TDD cell to be searched, Gap pattern configuration #
0 as defined in table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time aligmend. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time aligment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event B1 is used. The tests consist of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.7.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 6400ms from the beginning of time period
T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send the measurement report on
PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 25.6s from the beginning of time period
T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send preambles on the
PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to send the measurement
report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event B1 measurement report
### A.8.7.3 E-UTRAN TDD - UTRAN TDD SON ANR cell search reporting in AWGN
propagation conditions
#### A.8.7.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
the strongest UTRAN TDD cell for SON automatic neighbour relations. This test
will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD - UTRAN TDD cell search requirements for
identification of a new UTRA TDD cell for SON given in section 8.1.2.4.13.
In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
periodical reporting with the purpose 'reportStrongestCellsForSON' is used.
The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1,
and T2 respectively. Prior to the start of time period T1, an interRATperiodic
measurement reporting configuration with purpose reportStrongestCellsForSON is
configured, and linked to a UTRA measurement object corresponding to channel
UARFCN 1. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of cell 2.

### A.8.8.2 E-UTRAN FDD-GSM event triggered reporting when DRX is used in AWGN
#### A.8.8.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These tests will partly verify the E-UTRAN FDD-GSM cell
search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.4.5.2.
In these tests, there are two cells, one E-UTRAN cell and one GSM cell, and
gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The common test parameters are given in Table A.8.8.2.1-1. Cell specific test
parameters are given in Table A.8.8.2.1-2 for E-UTRAN and in Table A.8.8.2.1-5
for GSM. DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table A.8.8.2.1-3
and time alignment timer and scheduling request related parameters in Table
A.8.8.2.1-4.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time alignment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event B1 is used. The tests consist of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.8.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report including
BSIC of cell # 2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 3120 ms from
the beginning of time period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as
the time from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send
the measurement report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 42.8 seconds from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event B1 measurement report

the E-UTRAN TDD - GSM cell search requirements in section 8.1.2.4.6.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.10.1.1-1, A.8.8.1.1-2 and
A.8.10.1.1-3 below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event B1 is used. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively.
During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell
2.

#### A.8.10.1.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report including the
valid BSIC of cell # 2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 3120 ms
from the beginning of time period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
> NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
> 2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of
> TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.
NOTE 2: The delay for GSM cell identification with BSIC verified is equal to
3120 ms, which is the sum of the event triggered measurement reporting delay
and the initial BSIC identification delay.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay = 2*T~Measurement\ Period,\
GSM~ = 2* 480ms =960ms.
Initial BSIC identification delay = 2160 ms.
### A.8.10.2 E-UTRAN TDD-GSM event triggered reporting when DRX is used in
AWGN
#### A.8.10.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event in DRX. These tests will partly verify the E-UTRAN TDD-GSM cell
search requirements when DRX is used in section 8.1.2.4.6.
In these tests, there are two cells, one E-UTRAN cell and one GSM cell, and
gap pattern configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
The common test parameters are given in Table A.8.10.2.1-1. Cell specific test
parameters are given in Table A.8.10.2.1-2 for E-UTRAN and in Table
A.8.10.2.1-5 for GSM. DRX configuration for Test1 and Test2 are given in Table
A.8.10.2.1-3 and time alignment timer and scheduling request related
parameters in Table A.8.10.2.1-4.
In Test 1 UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time aligment timer to keep
UE uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH resource at
every DRX cycle. In Test 2 the uplink time alignment is not maintained and UE
needs to use RACH to obtain UL allocation for measurement reporting.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event B1 is used. The tests consist of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.8.10.2.2 Test Requirements
In Test1 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report including
BSIC of cell # 2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 3120 ms from
the beginning of time period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as
the time from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE send
the measurement report on PUSCH.
In Test2 the UE shall send one Event B1 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 42.8 seconds from the beginning of time
period T2. The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time from the
beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for scheduling request (SR) to obtain allocation to
send the measurement report on PUSCH.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE 1: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to one DRX
cycle higher than the measurement reporting delays above because UE is allowed
to delay the initiation of the measurement reporting procedure to the next
until the Active Time.
NOTE 2: In order to calculate the rate of correct events the system simulator
shall verify that it has received correct Event B1 measurement report

#### A.8.11.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
two events. This test will partly verify the TDD-TDD inter-frequency cell
search requirements in section 8.1.2.3.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.11.2.1-1 and A.8.11.2.1-2. In this
test, there are three cells on different carrier frequencies and gap pattern
configuration # 0 as defined in Table 8.1.2.1-1 is provided.
In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2 respectively. During time
duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing information of cell 2 and cell
3.

#### A.8.11.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 7680 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall send one Event B2 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 4800 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2xTTI~DCCH~
higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI insertion
uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

case
#### A.8.11.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of an event when
doing inter frequency measurements and UTRA TDD measurements. The test will
partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.3.2 combined 8.1.2.4.3 under
fading propagation conditions.
This test scenario comprised of 2 E-UTRA TDD cells operating on different
frequency, and 1 UTRA TDD cell. Test parameters are given in table
A.8.11.4.1-1, A.8.11.4.1-2, and A.8.11.4.1-3. Gap pattern configuration #0 as
defined in section 8.1.2.1 is provided.
The test consists of 2 successive time periods, with time duration T1 and T2.
In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event A3 and B2 shall be used.
