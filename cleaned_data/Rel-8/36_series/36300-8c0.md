# 4 Overall architecture
The E-UTRAN consists of eNBs, providing the E-UTRA user plane
(PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY) and control plane (RRC) protocol terminations towards the
UE. The eNBs are interconnected with each other by means of the X2 interface.
The eNBs are also connected by means of the S1 interface to the EPC (Evolved
Packet Core), more specifically to the MME (Mobility Management Entity) by
means of the S1-MME and to the Serving Gateway (S-GW) by means of the S1-U.
The S1 interface supports a many-to-many relation between MMEs / Serving
Gateways and eNBs.
The E-UTRAN architecture is illustrated in Figure 4 below.
Figure 4-1: Overall Architecture
## 4.1 Functional Split
The eNB hosts the following functions:
\- Functions for Radio Resource Management: Radio Bearer Control, Radio
Admission Control, Connection Mobility Control, Dynamic allocation of
resources to UEs in both uplink and downlink (scheduling);
\- IP header compression and encryption of user data stream;
\- Selection of an MME at UE attachment when no routing to an MME can be
determined from the information provided by the UE;
\- Routing of User Plane data towards Serving Gateway;
\- Scheduling and transmission of paging messages (originated from the MME);
\- Scheduling and transmission of broadcast information (originated from the
MME or O&M);
\- Measurement and measurement reporting configuration for mobility and

retransmission);
\- Tracking Area list management (for UE in idle and active mode);
\- PDN GW and Serving GW selection;
\- MME selection for handovers with MME change;
\- SGSN selection for handovers to 2G or 3G 3GPP access networks;
\- Roaming;
\- Authentication;
\- Bearer management functions including dedicated bearer establishment;
\- Support for ETWS message transmission.
The Serving Gateway (S-GW) hosts the following functions (see 3GPP TS 23.401
[17]):
> \- The local Mobility Anchor point for inter-eNB handover;
>
> \- Mobility anchoring for inter-3GPP mobility;
>
> \- E-UTRAN idle mode downlink packet buffering and initiation of network
> triggered service request procedure;
>
> \- Lawful Interception;

> \- Packet routeing and forwarding;
>
> \- Transport level packet marking in the uplink and the downlink;
>
> \- Accounting on user and QCI granularity for inter-operator charging;
>
> \- UL and DL charging per UE, PDN, and QCI.
The PDN Gateway (P-GW) hosts the following functions (see 3GPP TS 23.401
[17]):
> \- Per-user based packet filtering (by e.g. deep packet inspection);
>
> \- Lawful Interception;

This is summarized on the figure below where yellow boxes depict the logical
nodes, white boxes depict the functional entities of the control plane and
blue boxes depict the radio protocol layers.
NOTE: it is assumed that no other logical E-UTRAN node than the eNB is needed
for RRM purposes. Moreover, due to the different usage of inter-cell RRM
functionalities, each inter-cell RRM functionality should be considered
separately in order to assess whether it should be handled in a centralised
manner or in a distributed manner.
NOTE: MBMS related functions in E-UTRAN are described separately in subclause
15.

## 4.2 Interfaces
### 4.2.1 S1 Interface
### 4.2.2 X2 Interface
## 4.3 Radio Protocol architecture
In this subclause, the radio protocol architecture of E-UTRAN is given for the
user plane and the control plane.
### 4.3.1 User plane
The figure below shows the protocol stack for the user-plane, where PDCP, RLC
and MAC sublayers (terminated in eNB on the network side) perform the
functions listed for the user plane in subclause 6, e.g. header compression,
ciphering, scheduling, ARQ and HARQ;
Figure 4.3.1-1: User-plane protocol stack
### 4.3.2 Control plane
The figure below shows the protocol stack for the control-plane, where:
\- PDCP sublayer (terminated in eNB on the network side) performs the
functions listed for the control plane in subclause 6, e.g. ciphering and
integrity protection;
\- RLC and MAC sublayers (terminated in eNB on the network side) perform the
same functions as for the user plane;
\- RRC (terminated in eNB on the network side) performs the functions listed
in subclause 7, e.g.:
\- Broadcast;
\- Paging;
\- RRC connection management;
\- RB control;
\- Mobility functions;
\- UE measurement reporting and control.
\- NAS control protocol (terminated in MME on the network side) performs among
other things:
\- EPS bearer management;
\- Authentication;
\- **ECM-IDLE** mobility handling;
\- Paging origination in **ECM-IDLE** ;
\- Security control.
NOTE: the NAS control protocol is not covered by the scope of this TS and is
only mentioned for information.
Figure 4.3.2-1: Control-plane protocol stack
## 4.4 Synchronization
Diverse methods and techniques are preferred depending on synchronization
requirements. As no single method can cover all E-UTRAN applications a logical
port at eNB may be used for reception of timing and/or frequency and/or phase
inputs pending to the synchronization method chosen.
## 4.5 IP fragmentation
Fragmentation function in IP layer on S1 and X2 shall be supported.
Configuration of S1-U (X2-U) link MTU in the eNB/ S-GW according to the MTU of
the network domain the node belongs to shall be considered as a choice at
network deployment. The network may employ various methods to handle IP
fragmentation, but the specific methods to use are implementation dependant.
At the establishment/modification of an EPS bearer, the network may signal a
value that is to be used as MTU by the UE IP stack (it is FFS how the
requirement on the UE should be formulated). It is also FFS if the MTU is
signalled by the MME or the eNB.
## 4.6 Support of HeNBs
### 4.6.1 Architecture
Figure 4.6.1-1 shows a logical architecture for the HeNB that has a set of S1
interfaces to connect the HeNB to the EPC.
The configuration and authentication entities as shown here should be common
to HeNBs and HNBs.
Figure 4.6.1-1: E-UTRAN HeNB Logical Architecture
The E-UTRAN architecture may deploy a Home eNB Gateway (HeNB GW) to allow the
S1 interface between the HeNB and the EPC to scale to support a large number
of HeNBs. The HeNB GW serves as a concentrator for the C-Plane, specifically
the S1-MME interface. The S1-U interface from the HeNB may be terminated at
the HeNB GW, or a direct logical U-Plane connection between HeNB and S-GW may
be used (as shown in Figure 4.6.1-1).
This version of the specification does not support X2 connectivity of HeNBs.
The S1 interface is defined as the interface:
\- Between the HeNB GW and the Core Network,
\- Between the HeNB and the HeNB GW,
\- Between the HeNB and the Core Network,
\- Between the eNB and the Core Network.
The HeNB GW appears to the MME as an eNB. The HeNB GW appears to the HeNB as
an MME. The S1 interface between the HeNB and the EPC is the same whether the
HeNB is connected to the EPC via a HeNB GW or not.
The HeNB GW shall connect to the EPC in a way that inbound and outbound
mobility to cells served by the HeNB GW shall not necessarily require inter
MME handovers. One HeNB serves only one cell.
The functions supported by the HeNB shall be the same as those supported by an
eNB (with the possible exception of NNSF) and the procedures run between a
HeNB and the EPC shall be the same as those between an eNB and the EPC.
Figure 4.6.1-2: Overall E-UTRAN Architecture with deployed HeNB GW.
### 4.6.2 Functional Split
The HeNB hosts the same functions as an eNB as described in section 4.1, with
the following additional specifications in case of connection to the HeNB GW:
\- Discovery of a suitable Serving HeNB GW
\- A HeNB shall only connect to a single HeNB GW at one time, namely no S1
Flex function shall be used at the HeNB in case of connection to the HeNB GW.
\- If the HeNB is connected to a HeNB GW, it will not simultaneously connect
to another HeNB GW, or another MME.
\- The TAC and PLMN ID used by the HeNB shall also be supported by the HeNB
GW.
\- When the HeNB connects to a HeNB GW, selection of an MME at UE attachment
is hosted by the HeNB GW instead of the HeNB;
\- HeNBs may be deployed without network planning. A HeNB may be moved from
one geographical area to another and therefore it may need to connect to
different HeNB GWs depending on its location.
The HeNB GW hosts the following functions:
\- Relaying UE-associated S1 application part messages between the MME serving
the UE and the HeNB serving the UE;
\- Terminating non-UE associated S1 application part procedures towards the
HeNB and towards the MME. Note that when a HeNB GW is deployed, non-UE
associated procedures shall be run between HeNBs and the HeNB GW and between
the HeNB GW and the MME.
\- Optionally terminating S1-U interface with the HeNB and with the S-GW.
\- Supporting TAC and PLMN ID used by the HeNB.
\- X2 interfaces shall not be established between the HeNB GW and other nodes.
\- Optionally performing paging optimisation in case the Allowed CSG List of
the paged UE is included in the PAGING message.
In addition to functions specified in section 4.1, the MME hosts the following
functions:
\- Access control for UEs that are members of Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG).
\- Optionally performing paging optimisation.
NOTE: The MME or HeNB GW should not include the Allowed CSG List when sending
the paging message directly to an untrusted HeNB or eNB.
### 4.6.3 Interfaces
#### 4.6.3.1 Protocol Stack for S1 User Plane
The S1-U data plane is defined between the HeNB, HeNB GW and the S-GW. The
figures below shows the S1-U protocol stack with and without the HeNB GW.
Figure 4.6.3.1-1: User plane for S1-U interface for HeNB without HeNB GW
Figure 4.6.3.1-2: User plane for S1-U interface for HeNB with HeNB GW
The HeNB GW may optionally terminate the user plane towards the HeNB and
towards the S-GW, and provide a relay function for relaying User Plane data
between the HeNB and the S-GW.
#### 4.6.3.2 Protocol Stacks for S1 Control Plane
The two figures below show the S1-MME protocol stacks with and without the
HeNB GW.
When the HeNB GW is not present (Fig. 4.6.3.2-1), all the S1 procedures are
terminated at the HeNB and the MME.
When present (Fig. 4.6.3.2-2), the HeNB GW shall terminate the non-UE-
dedicated procedures -- both with the HeNB, and with the MME. The HeNB GW
shall provide a relay function for relaying Control Plane data between the
HeNB and the MME. The scope of any protocol function associated to a non-UE-
dedicated procedure shall be between HeNB and HeNB GW and/or between HeNB GW
and MME.
Any protocol function associated to an UE-dedicated-procedure shall reside
within the HeNB and the MME only.

the HeNB GW

# 5 Physical Layer for E-UTRA
Downlink and uplink transmissions are organized into radio frames with 10 ms
duration. Two radio frame structures are supported:
\- Type 1, applicable to FDD,
\- Type 2, applicable to TDD.
Frame structure Type 1 is illustrated in Figure 5.1-1. Each 10 ms radio frame
is divided into ten equally sized sub-frames. Each sub-frame consists of two
equally sized slots. For FDD, 10 subframes are available for downlink
transmission and 10 subframes are available for uplink transmissions in each
10 ms interval. Uplink and downlink transmissions are separated in the
frequency domain.
Figure 5.1-1: Frame structure type 1
Frame structure Type 2 is illustrated in Figure 5.1-2. Each 10 ms radio frame
consists of two half-frames of 5 ms each. Each half-frame consists of eight
slots of length 0.5 ms and three special fields: DwPTS, GP and UpPTS. The
length of DwPTS and UpPTS is configurable subject to the total length of
DwPTS, GP and UpPTS being equal to 1ms. Both 5ms and 10ms switch-point
periodicity are supported. Subframe 1 in all configurations and subframe 6 in
configuration with 5ms switch-point periodicity consist of DwPTS, GP and
UpPTS. Subframe 6 in configuration with 10ms switch-point periodicity consists
of DwPTS only. All other subframes consist of two equally sized slots.
For TDD, GP is reserved for downlink to uplink transition. Other
Subframes/Fields are assigned for either downlink or uplink transmission.
Uplink and downlink transmissions are separated in the time domain.

The physical channels of E-UTRA are:
**Physical broadcast channel (PBCH)**
\- The coded BCH transport block is mapped to four subframes within a 40 ms
interval;
\- 40 ms timing is blindly detected, i.e. there is no explicit signalling
indicating 40 ms timing;
\- Each subframe is assumed to be self-decodable, i.e. the BCH can be decoded
from a single reception, assuming sufficiently good channel conditions.
**Physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH)**
\- Informs the UE about the number of OFDM symbols used for the PDCCHs;
\- Transmitted in every downlink or special subframe.
**Physical downlink control channel (PDCCH)**
\- Informs the UE about the resource allocation of PCH and DL-SCH, and Hybrid
ARQ information related to DL-SCH;
\- Carries the uplink scheduling grant.
**Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH)**
\- Carries Hybrid ARQ ACK/NAKs in response to uplink transmissions.
**Physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH)**
\- Carries the DL-SCH and PCH.
**Physical multicast channel (PMCH)**
\- Carries the MCH.
**Physical uplink control channel (PUCCH)**
\- Carries Hybrid ARQ ACK/NAKs in response to downlink transmission;
\- Carries Scheduling Request (SR);
\- Carries CQI reports.
**Physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH)**
\- Carries the UL-SCH.
**Physical random access channel (PRACH)**
\- Carries the random access preamble.
## 5.1 Downlink Transmission Scheme
### 5.1.1 Basic transmission scheme based on OFDM
The downlink transmission scheme is based on conventional OFDM using a cyclic
prefix. The OFDM sub-carrier spacing is _âˆ†f_ = 15 kHz. 12 consecutive sub-
carriers during one slot correspond to one downlink _resource block_. In the
frequency domain, the number of resource blocks, N~RB~, can range from N~RB-
min~ = 6 to N~RB-max~ = 110.
In addition there is also a reduced sub-carrier spacing _âˆ†f~low~_ = 7.5 kHz,
only for MBMS-dedicated cell.
In the case of 15 kHz sub-carrier spacing there are two cyclic-prefix lengths,
corresponding to seven and six OFDM symbols per slot respectively.
\- Normal cyclic prefix: T~CP~ = 160Ã—Ts (OFDM symbol #0) , T~CP~ = 144Ã—Ts
(OFDM symbol #1 to #6)
\- Extended cyclic prefix: T~CP-e~ = 512Ã—Ts (OFDM symbol #0 to OFDM symbol #5)
where T~s~ = 1/ (2048 Ã— âˆ†f)
In case of 7.5 kHz sub-carrier spacing, there is only a single cyclic prefix
length T~CP-low~ = 1024Ã—Ts, corresponding to 3 OFDM symbols per slot.
In case of FDD, operation with half duplex from UE point of view is supported.
### 5.1.2 Physical-layer processing
The downlink physical-layer processing of transport channels consists of the
following steps:
\- CRC insertion: 24 bit CRC is the baseline for PDSCH;
\- Channel coding: Turbo coding based on QPP inner interleaving with trellis
termination;
\- Physical-layer hybrid-ARQ processing;
\- Channel interleaving;
\- Scrambling: transport-channel specific scrambling on DL-SCH, BCH, and PCH.
Common MCH scrambling for all cells involved in a specific MBSFN transmission;
\- Modulation: QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM;
\- Layer mapping and pre-coding;
\- Mapping to assigned resources and antenna ports.
### 5.1.3 Physical downlink control channel
The downlink control signalling (PDCCH) is located in the first _n_ OFDM
symbols where _n_ â‰¤ 4 and consists of:
\- Transport format and resource allocation related to DL-SCH and PCH, and
hybrid ARQ information related to DL-SCH;
\- Transport format, resource allocation, and hybrid-ARQ information related
to UL-SCH;
Transmission of control signalling from these groups is mutually independent.
Multiple physical downlink control channels are supported and a UE monitors a
set of control channels.
_Control channels_ are formed by aggregation of _control channel elements,
each control channel element consisting of a set of resource elements.
Different code rates for the control channels are realized by aggregating
different numbers of control channel elements._
QPSK modulation is used for all control channels.
Each separate control channel has its own set of x-RNTI.
There is an implicit relation between the uplink resources used for
dynamically scheduled data transmission, or the DL control channel used for
assignment, and the downlink ACK/NAK resource used for feedback
### 5.1.4 Downlink Reference signal
The downlink reference signals consist of known reference symbols inserted in
the first and third last OFDM symbol of each slot. There is one reference
signal transmitted per downlink antenna port. The number of downlink antenna
ports equals 1, 2, or 4. The two-dimensional reference signal sequence is
generated as the symbol-by-symbol product of a two-dimensional orthogonal
sequence and a two-dimensional pseudo-random sequence. There are 3 different
two-dimensional orthogonal sequences and 170 different two-dimensional pseudo-
random sequences. Each cell identity corresponds to a unique combination of
one orthogonal sequence and one pseudo-random sequence, thus allowing for 504
unique cell identities 168 cell identity groups with 3 cell identities in each
group).
Frequency hopping can be applied to the downlink reference signals. The
frequency hopping pattern has a period of one frame (10 ms). Each frequency
hopping pattern corresponds to one cell identity group.
The downlink MBSFN reference signals consist of known reference symbols
inserted every other sub-carrier in the 3rd, 7th and 11th OFDM symbol of sub-
frame in case of 15kHz sub-carrier spacing and extended cyclic prefix
### 5.1.5 Downlink multi-antenna transmission
Multi-antenna transmission with 2 and 4 transmit antennas is supported. The
maximum number of codeword is two irrespective to the number of antennas with
fixed mapping between code words to layers.
Spatial division multiplexing (SDM) of multiple modulation symbol streams to a
single UE using the same time-frequency (-code) resource, also referred to as
Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO) is supported. When a MIMO channel is solely
assigned to a single UE, it is known as SU-MIMO. Spatial division multiplexing
of modulation symbol streams to different UEs using the same time-frequency
resource, also referred to as MU-MIMO, is also supported. There is semi-static
switching between SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO per UE.
In addition, the following techniques are supported:
\- Code-book-based pre-coding with a single pre-coding feedback per full
system bandwidth when the system bandwidth (or subset of resource blocks) is
smaller or equal to12RB and per 5 adjacent resource blocks or the full system
bandwidth (or subset of resource blocks) when the system bandwidth is larger
than 12RB.
\- Rank adaptation with single rank feedback referring to full system
bandwidth. Node B can override rank report.
### 5.1.6 MBSFN transmission
MBSFN is supported for the MCH transport channel. Multiplexing of transport
channels using MBSFN and non-MBSFN transmission is done on a per-sub-frame
basis. Additional reference symbols, transmitted using MBSFN are transmitted
within MBSFN subframes.
### 5.1.7 Physical layer procedure
#### 5.1.7.1 Link adaptation
Link adaptation (AMC: adaptive modulation and coding) with various modulation
schemes and channel coding rates is applied to the shared data channel. The
same coding and modulation is applied to all groups of resource blocks
belonging to the same L2 PDU scheduled to one user within one TTI and within a
single stream.
#### 5.1.7.2 Power Control
Downlink power control can be used.
#### 5.1.7.3 Cell search
Cell search is the procedure by which a UE acquires time and frequency
synchronization with a cell and detects the Cell ID of that cell. E-UTRA cell
search supports a scalable overall transmission bandwidth corresponding to 72
sub-carriers and upwards.
E-UTRA cell search is based on following signals transmitted in the downlink:
the primary and secondary synchronization signals, the downlink reference
signals.
The primary and secondary synchronization signals are transmitted over the
centre 72 sub-carriers in the first and sixth subframe of each frame.
Neighbour-cell search is based on the same downlink signals as initial cell
search.
### 5.1.8 Physical layer measurements definition
The physical layer measurements to support mobility are classified as:
\- within E-UTRAN (intra-frequency, inter-frequency);
\- between E-UTRAN and GERAN/UTRAN (inter-RAT);
\- between E-UTRAN and non-3GPP RAT (Inter 3GPP access system mobility).
For measurements within E-UTRAN at least two basic UE measurement quantities
shall be supported:
\- Reference symbol received power (RSRP);
\- E-UTRA carrier received signal strength indicator (RSSI).
## 5.2 Uplink Transmission Scheme
### 5.2.1 Basic transmission scheme
For both FDD and TDD, the uplink transmission scheme is based on single-
carrier FDMA, more specifically DFTS-OFDM.
Figure 5.2.1-1: Transmitter scheme of SC-FDMA
The uplink sub-carrier spacing _âˆ†f_ = 15 kHz. The sub-carriers are grouped
into sets of 12 consecutive sub-carriers, corresponding to the uplink resource
blocks. 12 consecutive sub-carriers during one slot correspond to one uplink
_resource block_. In the frequency domain, the number of resource blocks,
N~RB~, can range from N~RB-min~ = 6 to N~RB-max~ = 110.
There are two cyclic-prefix lengths defined: Normal cyclic prefix and extended
cyclic prefix corresponding to seven and six SC-FDMA symbol per slot
respectively.
\- Normal cyclic prefix: T~CP~ = 160Ã—Ts (SC-FDMA symbol #0) , T~CP~ = 144Ã—Ts
(SC-FDMA symbol #1 to #6)
\- Extended cyclic prefix: T~CP-e~ = 512Ã—Ts (SC-FDMA symbol #0 to SC-FDMA
symbol #5)
### 5.2.2 Physical-layer processing
The uplink physical layer processing of transport channels consists of the
following steps:
\- CRC insertion: 24 bit CRC is the baseline for PUSCH;
\- Channel coding: turbo coding based on QPP inner interleaving with trellis
termination;
\- Physical-layer hybrid-ARQ processing;
\- Scrambling: UE-specific scrambling;
\- Modulation: QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM (64 QAM optional in UE);
\- Mapping to assigned resources and antennas ports.
### 5.2.3 Physical uplink control channel
The PUCCH shall be mapped to a control channel resource in the uplink. A
control channel resource is defined by a code and two resource blocks,
consecutive in time, with hopping at the slot boundary.
Depending on presence or absence of uplink timing synchronization, the uplink
physical control signalling can differ.
In the case of time synchronization being present, the outband control
signalling consists of:
\- CQI;
\- ACK/NAK;
\- Scheduling Request (SR).
The CQI informs the scheduler about the current channel conditions as seen by
the UE. If MIMO transmission is used, the CQI includes necessary MIMO-related
feedback.
The HARQ feedback in response to downlink data transmission consists of a
single ACK/NAK bit per HARQ process.
PUCCH resources for SR and CQI reporting are assigned and can be revoked
through RRC signalling. An SR is not necessarily assigned to UEs acquiring
synchronization through the RACH (i.e. synchronised UEs may or may not have a
dedicated SR channel). PUCCH resources for SR and CQI are lost when the UE is
no longer synchronized.
### 5.2.4 Uplink Reference signal
Uplink reference signals [for channel estimation for coherent demodulation]
are transmitted in the 4-th block of the slot [_assumed normal CP_]. The
uplink reference signals sequence length equals the size (number of sub-
carriers) of the assigned resource.
The uplink reference signals are based on prime-length Zadoff-chu sequences
that are cyclically extended to the desired length.
Multiple reference signals can be created:
\- Based on different Zadoff-Chu sequence from the same set of Zadoff-Chu
sequences;
\- Different shifts of the same sequence.
### 5.2.5 Random access preamble
The physical layer random access burst consists of a cyclic prefix, a
preamble, and a guard time during which nothing is transmitted.
The random access preambles are generated from Zadoff-Chu sequences with zero
correlation zone, ZC-ZCZ, generated from one or several root Zadoff-Chu
sequences.
### 5.2.6 Uplink multi-antenna transmission
The baseline antenna configuration for uplink MIMO is MU-MIMO. To allow for
MU-MIMO reception at the Node B, allocation of the same time and frequency
resource to several UEs, each of which transmitting on a single antenna, is
supported.
Closed loop type adaptive antenna selection transmit diversity shall be
supported for FDD (optional in UE).
### 5.2.7 Physical channel procedure
#### 5.2.7.1 Link adaptation
Uplink link adaptation is used in order to guarantee the required minimum
transmission performance of each UE such as the user data rate, packet error
rate, and latency, while maximizing the system throughput.
Three types of link adaptation are performed according to the channel
conditions, the UE capability such as the maximum transmission power and
maximum transmission bandwidth etc., and the required QoS such as the data
rate, latency, and packet error rate etc. Three link adaptation methods are as
follows.
\- Adaptive transmission bandwidth;
\- Transmission power control;
\- Adaptive modulation and channel coding rate.
#### 5.2.7.2 Uplink Power control
Intra-cell power control: the power spectral density of the uplink
transmissions can be influenced by the eNB.
#### 5.2.7.3 Uplink timing control
The timing advance is derived from the UL received timing and sent by the eNB
to the UE which the UE uses to advance/delay its timings of transmissions to
the eNB so as to compensate for propagation delay and thus time align the
transmissions from different UEs with the receiver window of the eNB.
The timing advance command is on a per need basis with a granularity in the
step size of 0.52 Î¼s (16Ã—T~s~).
## 5.3 Transport Channels
The physical layer offers information transfer services to MAC and higher
layers. The physical layer transport services are described by _how_ and with
what characteristics data are transferred over the radio interface. An
adequate term for this is "Transport Channel".
NOTE: This should be clearly separated from the classification of _what_ is
transported, which relates to the concept of logical channels at MAC sublayer.
Downlink transport channel types are:
1\. **Broadcast Channel (BCH)** characterised by:
\- fixed, pre-defined transport format;
\- requirement to be broadcast in the entire coverage area of the cell.
2\. **Downlink Shared Channel (DL-SCH)** characterised by:
\- support for HARQ;
\- support for dynamic link adaptation by varying the modulation, coding and
transmit power;
\- possibility to be broadcast in the entire cell;
\- possibility to use beamforming;
\- support for both dynamic and semi-static resource allocation;
\- support for UE discontinuous reception (DRX) to enable UE power saving.
NOTE: the possibility to use slow power control depends on the physical layer.
3\. **Paging Channel (PCH)** characterised by:
\- support for UE discontinuous reception (DRX) to enable UE power saving (DRX
cycle is indicated by the network to the UE);
\- requirement to be broadcast in the entire coverage area of the cell;
\- mapped to physical resources which can be used dynamically also for
traffic/other control channels.
4\. **Multicast Channel (MCH)** characterised by:
> \- requirement to be broadcast in the entire coverage area of the cell;
>
> \- support for MBSFN combining of MBMS transmission on multiple cells;
>
> \- support for semi-static resource allocation e.g. with a time frame of a
> long cyclic prefix.
Uplink transport channel types are:
1\. **Uplink Shared Channel (UL-SCH)** characterised by:
\- possibility to use beamforming; (likely no impact on specifications)
\- support for dynamic link adaptation by varying the transmit power and
potentially modulation and coding;
\- support for HARQ;
\- support for both dynamic and semi-static resource allocation.
NOTE: the possibility to use uplink synchronisation and timing advance depend
on the physical layer.
2\. **Random Access Channel(s) (RACH)** characterised by:
\- limited control information;
\- collision risk;
NOTE: the possibility to use open loop power control depends on the physical
layer solution.

# 6 Layer 2
Layer 2 is split into the following sublayers: Medium Access Control (MAC),
Radio Link Control (RLC) and Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP).
This subclause gives a high level description of the Layer 2 sub-layers in
terms of services and functions. The two figures below depict the PDCP/RLC/MAC
architecture for downlink and uplink, where:
\- Service Access Points (SAP) for peer-to-peer communication are marked with
circles at the interface between sublayers. The SAP between the physical layer
and the MAC sublayer provides the transport channels. The SAPs between the MAC
sublayer and the RLC sublayer provide the logical channels.
\- The multiplexing of several logical channels (i.e. radio bearers) on the
same transport channel (i.e. transport block) is performed by the MAC
sublayer;
\- In both uplink and downlink, only one transport block is generated per TTI
in the non-MIMO case.

NOTE: The eNB may not be able to guarantee that a L2 buffer overflow will
never occur. If such overflow occurs, UE may discard packets in the L2 buffer.
## 6.1 MAC Sublayer
This subclause provides an overview on services and functions provided by the
MAC sublayer.
### 6.1.1 Services and Functions
The main services and functions of the MAC sublayer include:

channel type is defined by what type of information is transferred.
A general classification of logical channels is into two groups:
\- Control Channels (for the transfer of control plane information);
\- Traffic Channels (for the transfer of user plane information).
There is one MAC entity per cell. MAC generally consists of several function
blocks (transmission scheduling functions, per UE functions, MAC control
functions, transport block generation...). Transparent Mode is only applied to
BCCH and PCCH.
#### 6.1.2.1 Control Channels
Control channels are used for transfer of control plane information only. The
control channels offered by MAC are:
**\- Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH)**
A downlink channel for broadcasting system control information.
**\- Paging Control Channel (PCCH)**
A downlink channel that transfers paging information and system information
change notifications. This channel is used for paging when the network does
not know the location cell of the UE.
**\- Common Control Channel (CCCH)**
Channel for transmitting control information between UEs and network. This
channel is used for UEs having no RRC connection with the network.
**\- Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH)**
A point-to-point bi-directional channel that transmits dedicated control
information between a UE and the network. Used by UEs having an RRC
connection.
#### 6.1.2.2 Traffic Channels
Traffic channels are used for the transfer of user plane information only. The
traffic channels offered by MAC are:
**\- Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH)**
A Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH) is a point-to-point channel, dedicated to
one UE, for the transfer of user information. A DTCH can exist in both uplink
and downlink.
### 6.1.3 Mapping between logical channels and transport channels
#### 6.1.3.1 Mapping in Uplink
The figure below depicts the mapping between uplink logical channels and
uplink transport channels:
Figure 6.1.3.1-1: Mapping between uplink logical channels and uplink transport
channels
In Uplink, the following connections between logical channels and transport
channels exist:
\- CCCH can be mapped to UL-SCH;
\- DCCH can be mapped to UL- SCH;
\- DTCH can be mapped to UL-SCH.
#### 6.1.3.2 Mapping in Downlink
The figure below depicts the mapping between downlink logical channels and
downlink transport channels:
Figure 6.1.3.2-1: Mapping between downlink logical channels and downlink
transport channels
In Downlink, the following connections between logical channels and transport
channels exist:
\- BCCH can be mapped to BCH;
\- BCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;
\- PCCH can be mapped to PCH;
\- CCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;
\- DCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;
\- DTCH can be mapped to DL-SCH.
## 6.2 RLC Sublayer
This subclause provides an overview on services, functions and PDU structure
provided by the RLC sublayer. Note that:
\- The reliability of RLC is configurable: some radio bearers may tolerate
rare losses (e.g. TCP traffic);
\- Radio Bearers are not characterized by a fixed sized data unit (e.g. a
fixed sized RLC PDU).
### 6.2.1 Services and Functions
The main services and functions of the RLC sublayer include:
\- Transfer of upper layer PDUs;
\- Error Correction through ARQ (only for AM data transfer);
\- Concatenation, segmentation and reassembly of RLC SDUs (only for UM and AM
data transfer);
\- Re-segmentation of RLC data PDUs (only for AM data transfer);
\- In sequence delivery of upper layer PDUs (only for UM and AM data
transfer);
\- Duplicate detection (only for UM and AM data transfer);
\- Protocol error detection and recovery;
\- RLC SDU discard (only for UM and AM data transfer);
\- RLC re-establishment.
### 6.2.2 PDU Structure
Figure 6.2.2-1 below depicts the RLC PDU structure where:
\- The PDU sequence number carried by the RLC header is independent of the SDU
sequence number (i.e. PDCP sequence number);
\- A red dotted line indicates the occurrence of segmentation;
\- Because segmentation only occurs when needed and concatenation is done in
sequence, the content of an RLC PDU can generally be described by the
following relations:
\- {0; 1} last segment of SDU~i~ + [0; n] complete SDUs + {0; 1} first segment
of SDU~i+n+1~ ; or
\- 1 segment of SDU~i~ .

\- Transfer of control plane data.
### 6.3.2 PDU Structure

specified in [15].
## 6.4 Void
# 7 RRC
This subclause provides an overview on services and functions provided by the
RRC sublayer.
## 7.1 Services and Functions
The main services and functions of the RRC sublayer include:
\- Broadcast of System Information related to the non-access stratum (NAS);
\- Broadcast of System Information related to the access stratum (AS);
\- Paging;
\- Establishment, maintenance and release of an RRC connection between the UE
and E-UTRAN including:
\- Allocation of temporary identifiers between UE and E-UTRAN;
\- Configuration of signalling radio bearer(s) for RRC connection:
\- Low priority SRB and high priority SRB.
\- Security functions including key management;
\- Establishment, configuration, maintenance and release of point to point
Radio Bearers;
\- Mobility functions including:
\- UE measurement reporting and control of the reporting for inter-cell and
inter-RAT mobility;
\- Handover;
\- UE cell selection and reselection and control of cell selection and
reselection;
\- Context transfer at handover.
\- QoS management functions;
\- UE measurement reporting and control of the reporting;
\- NAS direct message transfer to/from NAS from/to UE.
## 7.2 RRC protocol states & state transitions
RRC uses the following states:
\- **RRC_IDLE** :
\- PLMN selection;
\- DRX configured by NAS;
\- Broadcast of system information;
\- Paging;
\- Cell re-selection mobility;
\- The UE shall have been allocated an id which uniquely identifies the UE in
a tracking area;
\- No RRC context stored in the eNB.
\- **RRC_CONNECTED** :
\- UE has an E-UTRAN-RRC connection;
\- UE has context in E-UTRAN;
\- E-UTRAN knows the cell which the UE belongs to;
\- Network can transmit and/or receive data to/from UE;
\- Network controlled mobility (handover and inter-RAT cell change order to
GERAN with NACC);
\- Neighbour cell measurements;
\- At PDCP/RLC/MAC level:
\- UE can transmit and/or receive data to/from network;
\- UE monitors control signalling channel for shared data channel to see if
any transmission over the shared data channel has been allocated to the UE;
\- UE also reports channel quality information and feedback information to
eNB;
\- DRX period can be configured according to UE activity level for UE power
saving and efficient resource utilization. This is under control of the eNB.
## 7.3 Transport of NAS messages
The AS provides reliable in-sequence delivery of NAS messages in a cell.
During handover, message loss or duplication of NAS messages can occur.
In E-UTRAN, NAS messages are either concatenated with RRC messages or carried
in RRC without concatenation. Upon arrival of concurrent NAS messages for the
same UE requiring both concatenation with RRC for the high priority queue and
also without concatenation for the lower priority queue, the messages are
first queued as necessary to maintain in-sequence delivery.
In DL, when an EPS bearer establishment or release procedure is triggered, the
NAS message should normally be concatenated with the associated RRC message.
When the EPS bearer is modified and when the modification also depends on a
modification of the radio bearer, the NAS message and associated RRC message
should normally be concatenated. Concatenation of DL NAS with RRC message is
not allowed otherwise. In uplink concatenation of NAS messages with RRC
message is used only for transferring the initial NAS message during
connection setup. Initial Direct Transfer is not used in E-UTRAN and no NAS
message is concatenated with RRC connection request.
Multiple NAS messages can be sent in a single downlink RRC message during EPS
bearer establishment or modification. In this case, the order of the NAS
messages in the RRC message shall be kept the same as that in the
corresponding S1-AP message in order to ensure the in-sequence delivery of NAS
messages.
NOTE: NAS messages are integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP, in addition
to the integrity protection and ciphering performed by NAS.
## 7.4 System Information
System information is divided into the _MasterInformationBlock_ (MIB) and a
number of _SystemInformationBlocks_ (SIBs):
_\- MasterInformationBlock_ defines the most essential physical layer
information of the cell required to receive further system information;
\- _SystemInformationBlockType1_ contains information relevant when evaluating
if a UE is allowed to access a cell and defines the scheduling of other system
information blocks;
\- _SystemInformationBlockType2_ contains common and shared channel
information;
\- _SystemInformationBlockType3_ contains cell re-selection information,
mainly related to the serving cell;
\- _SystemInformationBlockType4_ contains information about the serving
frequency and intra-frequency neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-
selection (including cell re-selection parameters common for a frequency as
well as cell specific re-selection parameters);
\- _SystemInformationBlockType5 contains information about_ other Eâ€‘UTRA
frequencies and inter-frequency neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-
selection (including cell re-selection parameters common for a frequency as
well as cell specific re-selection parameters);
\- _SystemInformationBlockType6 contains information about_ UTRA frequencies
and UTRA neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-selection (including cell re-
selection parameters common for a frequency as well as cell specific re-
selection parameters);
\- _SystemInformationBlockType7 contains information about_ GERAN frequencies
relevant for cell re-selection (including cell re-selection parameters for
each frequency);
\- _SystemInformationBlockType8_ contains information about CDMA2000
frequencies and CDMA2000 neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-selection
(including cell re-selection parameters common for a frequency as well as cell
specific re-selection parameters);
\- _SystemInformationBlockType9_ contains a home eNB identifier (HNBID);
\- _SystemInformationBlockType10_ contains an ETWS primary notification;
\- _SystemInformationBlockType11_ contains an ETWS secondary notification.
The MIB is mapped on the BCCH and carried on BCH while all other SI messages
are mapped on the BCCH and dynamically carried on DL-SCH where they can be
identified through the SI-RNTI (System Information RNTI). Both the MIBand
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ use a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 40
and 80 ms respectively while the scheduling of other SI messages is flexible
and indicated by _SystemInformationBlockType1_.
The eNB may schedule DL-SCH transmissions concerning logical channels other
than BCCH in the same subframe as used for BCCH. The minimum UE capability
restricts the BCCH mapped to DL-SCH e.g. regarding the maximum rate.
The Paging message is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED
about a system information change.
System information may also be provided to the UE by means of dedicated
signalling e.g. upon handover.
## 7.5 Void
# 8 E-UTRAN identities
## 8.1 E-UTRAN related UE identities
The following E-UTRAN related UE identities are used at cell level:
\- C-RNTI: unique identification used for identifying RRC Connection and
scheduling;
\- Semi-Persistent Scheduling C-RNTI: unique identification used for semi-
persistent scheduling;
\- Temporary C-RNTI: identification used for the random access procedure;
\- TPC-PUSCH-RNTI: identification used for the power control of PUSCH;
\- TPC-PUCCH-RNTI: identification used for the power control of PUCCH;
\- Random value for contention resolution: during some transient states, the
UE is temporarily identified with a random value used for contention
resolution purposes.
## 8.2 Network entity related Identities
The following identities are used in E-UTRAN for identifying a specific
network entity [25]:
\- Globally Unique MME Identity (GUMMEI): used to identify MME globally. The
GUMMEI is constructed from the PLMN identity the MME belongs to, the group
identity of the MME group the MME belongs to and the MME code (MMEC) of the
MME within the MME group.
NOTE: a UE in **ECM-IDLE** establishing an RRC connection has to provide the
GUMMEI of its current MME to the eNB in order for the eNB to fetch the UE
context from the MME. Within the S-TMSI, one field contains the code of the
MME (MMEC) that allocated the S-TMSI. The code of MME is needed to ensure that
the S-TMSI remains unique in a tracking area shared by multiple MMEs.
\- E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier (ECGI): used to identify cells globally. The
ECGI is constructed from the PLMN identity the cell belongs to and the Cell
Identity (CI) of the cell. The included PLMN is the one given by the first
PLMN entry in SIB1, according to [16].
\- eNB Identifier (eNB ID): used to identify eNBs within a PLMN. The eNB ID is
contained within the CI of its cells.
\- Global eNB ID: used to identify eNBs globally. The Global eNB ID is
constructed from the PLMN identity the eNB belongs to and the eNB ID. The MCC
and MNC are the same as included in the E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier (ECGI).
\- Tracking Area identity (TAI): used to identify tracking areas. The TAI is
constructed from the PLMN identity the tracking area belongs to and the TAC
(Tracking Area Code) of the Tracking Area.
\- CSG identity (CSG ID): used to identify a CSG within a PLMN.
\- EPS Bearer ID / E-RAB ID:
\- The value of the E-RAB ID used at S1 and X2 interfaces to identify an E-RAB
allocated to the UE is the same as the EPS Bearer ID value used at the Uu
interface to identify the associated EPS Bearer (and also used at the NAS
layer as defined in [25]).
The following identities are broadcast in every E-UTRAN cell (SIB1): CI, TAC,
CSG ID (if any) and one or more PLMN identities.
# 9 ARQ and HARQ
E-UTRAN provides ARQ and HARQ functionalities. The ARQ functionality provides
error correction by retransmissions in acknowledged mode at Layer 2. The HARQ
functionality ensures delivery between peer entities at Layer 1.
## 9.1 HARQ principles
The HARQ within the MAC sublayer has the following characteristics:
\- N-process Stop-And-Wait;
\- HARQ transmits and retransmits transport blocks;
\- In the downlink:
\- Asynchronous adaptive HARQ;
\- Uplink ACK/NAKs in response to downlink (re)transmissions are sent on PUCCH
or PUSCH;
\- PDCCH signals the HARQ process number and if it is a transmission or
retransmission;
\- Retransmissions are always scheduled through PDCCH.
\- In the uplink:
\- Synchronous HARQ;
\- Maximum number of retransmissions configured per UE (as opposed to per
radio bearer);
\- Downlink ACK/NAKs in response to uplink (re)transmissions are sent on
PHICH;
\- HARQ operation in uplink is governed by the following principles
(summarized in Table 9.1-1):
1) Regardless of the content of the HARQ feedback (ACK or NACK), when a PDCCH
for the UE is correctly received, the UE follows what the PDCCH asks the UE to
do i.e. perform a transmission or a retransmission (referred to as adaptive
retransmission);
2) When no PDCCH addressed to the C-RNTI of the UE is detected, the HARQ
feedback dictates how the UE performs retransmissions:
\- NACK: the UE performs a non-adaptive retransmission i.e. a retransmission
on the same uplink resource as previously used by the same process;
\- ACK: the UE does not perform any UL (re)transmission and keeps the data in
the HARQ buffer. A PDCCH is then required to perform a retransmission i.e. a
non-adaptive retransmission cannot follow.
\- Measurement gaps are of higher priority than HARQ retransmissions: whenever
an HARQ retransmission collides with a measurement gap, the HARQ
retransmission does not take place.

## 9.2 ARQ principles
The ARQ within the RLC sublayer has the following characteristics:
\- ARQ retransmits RLC PDUs or RLC PDU segments based on RLC status reports;
\- Polling for RLC status report is used when needed by RLC;
\- RLC receiver can also trigger RLC status report after detecting a missing
RLC PDU or RLC PDU segment.
## 9.3 Void
# 10 Mobility
Load balancing is achieved in E-UTRAN with redirection mechanisms (upon RRC
establishment, in RRC_CONNECTED and upon RRC release) and through the usage of
inter-frequency and inter-RAT absolute priorities and inter-frequency Qoffset
parameters.
Measurements to be performed by a UE for mobility are classified in at least
three measurement types:
\- Intra-frequency E-UTRAN measurements;
\- Inter-frequency E-UTRAN measurements;
\- Inter-RAT measurements for UTRAN and GERAN;
\- Inter-RAT measurements of CDMA2000 HRPD or 1xRTT frequencies.
For each measurement type a measurement identity is used by E-UTRAN when
configuring measurements as well as by the UE when reporting results of the
measurements. Measurement quantities and reporting events are considered
separately for each measurement type. Measurement commands are used by E-UTRAN
to order the UE to start measurements, modify measurements or stop
measurements. Three reporting criteria are used: event triggered reporting,
periodic reporting and event triggered periodic reporting.
## 10.1 Intra E-UTRAN
In E-UTRAN RRC_CONNECTED state, network-controlled UE-assisted handovers are
performed and various DRX cycles are supported.
In E-UTRAN RRC_IDLE state, cell reselections are performed and DRX is
supported.
### 10.1.1 Mobility Management in ECM-IDLE
#### 10.1.1.1 Cell selection
The principles of PLMN selection in E-UTRA are based on the 3GPP PLMN
selection principles. Cell selection is required on transition from
EMM_DETACHED to EMM-REGISTERED and from ECM-IDLE or ECM-CONNECTED.
Cell selection:
\- The UE NAS identifies a selected PLMN and equivalent PLMNs;
\- The UE searches the E-UTRA frequency bands and for each carrier frequency
identifies the strongest cell. It reads cell system information broadcast to
identify its PLMN(s):
\- The UE may search each carrier in turn ("initial cell selection") or make
use of stored information to shorten the search ("stored information cell
selection").
\- The UE seeks to identify a suitable cell; if it is not able to identify a
suitable cell it seeks to identify an acceptable cell. When a suitable cell is
found or if only an acceptable cell is found it camps on that cell and
commence the cell reselection procedure:
\- A suitable cell is one for which the measured cell attributes satisfy the
cell selection criteria; the cell PLMN is the selected PLMN, registered or an
equivalent PLMN; the cell is not barred or reserved and the cell is not part
of a tracking area which is in the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming";
\- An acceptable cell is one for which the measured cell attributes satisfy
the cell selection criteria and the cell is not barred;
Transition to RRC_IDLE:
On transition from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE, a UE should camp on the last
cell for which it was in RRC_CONNECTED or a cell/any cell of set of cells or
frequency be assigned by RRC in the state transition message.
Recovery from out of coverage:
The UE should attempt to find a suitable cell in the manner described for
stored information or initial cell selection above. If no suitable cell is
found on any frequency or RAT the UE should attempt to find an acceptable
cell.
#### 10.1.1.2 Cell reselection
UE in RRC_IDLE performs cell reselection. The principles of the procedure are
the following:
\- The UE makes measurements of attributes of the serving and neighbour cells
to enable the reselection process:
\- There is no need to indicate neighbouring cell in the serving cell system
information to enable the UE to search and measure a cell i.e. E-UTRAN relies
on the UE to detect the neighbouring cells;
\- For the search and measurement of inter-frequency neighbouring cells, only
the carrier frequencies need to be indicated;
\- Measurements may be omitted if the serving cell attribute fulfils
particular search or measurement criteria.
\- Cell reselection identifies the cell that the UE should camp on. It is
based on cell reselection criteria which involves measurements of the serving
and neighbour cells:
\- Intra-frequency reselection is based on ranking of cells;
\- Inter-frequency reselection is based on absolute priorities where UE tries
to camp on highest priority frequency available. Absolute priorities for
reselection are provided only by the RPLMN and valid only within the RPLMN;
priorities are given by the system information and valid for all UEs in a
cell, specific priorities per UE can be signalled in the RRC Connection
Release message. A validity time can be associated with UE specific
priorities.
\- For inter-frequency neighbouring cells, it is possible to indicate layer-
specific cell reselection parameters (e.g., layer specific offset). These
parameters are common to all neighbouring cells on a frequency;
\- An NCL can be provided by the serving cell to handle specific cases for
intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells. This NCL contains cell specific
cell reselection parameters (e.g., cell specific offset) for specific
neighbouring cells;
\- Black lists can be provided to prevent the UE from reselecting to specific
intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells;
\- Cell reselection can be speed dependent (speed detection based on UTRAN
solution);
> \- Cell reselection parameters are applicable for all UEs in a cell, but it
> is possible to configure specific reselection parameters per UE group or per
> UE.
Cell access restrictions apply as for UTRAN, which consist of access class
(AC) barring and cell reservation (e.g. for cells \"reserved for operator
use\") applicable for mobiles in RRC_IDLE mode.

#### 10.1.1.4 Void
#### 10.1.1.5 Void
### 10.1.2 Mobility Management in ECM-CONNECTED
The Intra-E-UTRAN-Access Mobility Support for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED handles all
necessary steps for relocation/handover procedures, like processes that
precede the final HO decision on the source network side (control and
evaluation of UE and eNB measurements taking into account certain UE specific
area restrictions), preparation of resources on the target network side,
commanding the UE to the new radio resources and finally releasing resources
on the (old) source network side. It contains mechanisms to transfer context
data between evolved nodes, and to update node relations on C-plane and
U-plane.
In E-UTRAN RRC_CONNECTED state, network-controlled UE-assisted handovers are
performed and various DRX cycles are supported:
The UE makes measurements of attributes of the serving and neighbour cells to
enable the process:
\- There is no need to indicate neighbouring cell to enable the UE to search
and measure a cell i.e. E-UTRAN relies on the UE to detect the neighbouring
cells;
\- For the search and measurement of inter-frequency neighbouring cells, at
least the carrier frequencies need to be indicated;
\- Network signals reporting criteria for event-triggered and periodical
reporting;
\- An NCL can be provided by the serving cell to handle specific cases for
intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells. This NCL containa cell specific
cell reselection parameters (e.g. cell specific offset) for specific
neighbouring cells;
\- Black lists can be provided to prevent the UE from measuring specific
neighbouring cells.
Depending on whether the UE needs transmission/reception gaps to perform the
relevant measurements, measurements are classified as gap assisted or non-gap
assisted. A non-gap assisted measurement is a measurement on a cell that does
not require transmission/reception gaps to allow the measurement to be
performed. A gap assisted measurement is a measurement on a cell that does
require transmission/reception gaps to allow the measurement to be performed.
Gap patterns (as opposed to individual gaps) are configured and activated by
RRC.
#### 10.1.2.1 Handover
The intra E-UTRAN HO in RRC_CONNECTED state is UE assisted NW controlled HO,
with HO preparation signalling in E-UTRAN:
\- Part of the HO command comes from the target eNB and is transparently
forwarded to the UE by the source eNB;
\- To prepare the HO, the source eNB passes all necessary information to the
target eNB (e.g. E-RAB attributes and RRC context);
\- Both the source eNB and UE keep some context (e.g. C-RNTI) to enable the
return of the UE in case of HO failure;
\- UE accesses the target cell via RACH following a contention-free procedure
using a dedicated RACH preamble or following a contention-based procedure if
dedicated RACH preambles are not available:
\- the UE uses the dedicated preamble until the handover procedure is finished
(successfully or unsuccessfully);
\- If the RACH procedure towards the target cell is not successful within a
certain time, the UE initiates radio link failure recovery using the best
cell;
\- No ROHC context is transferred at handover.
##### 10.1.2.1.1 C-plane handling
The HO procedure is performed without EPC involvement, i.e. preparation
messages are directly exchanged between the eNBs. The release of the resources
at the source side during the HO completion phase is triggered by the eNB. The
figure below depicts the basic handover scenario where neither MME nor Serving
Gateway changes:
Figure 10.1.2.1.1-1: Intra-MME/Serving Gateway HO
Below is a more detailed description of the intra-MME/Serving Gateway HO
procedure:
0 The UE context within the source eNB contains information regarding roaming
restrictions which where provided either at connection establishment or at the
last TA update.
1 The source eNB configures the UE measurement procedures according to the
area restriction information. Measurements provided by the source eNB may
assist the function controlling the UE\'s connection mobility.
2 UE is triggered to send MEASUREMENT REPORT by the rules set by i.e. system
information, specification etc.
3 Source eNB makes decision based on MEASUREMENT REPORT and RRM information to
hand off UE.
4 The source eNB issues a HANDOVER REQUEST message to the target eNB passing
necessary information to prepare the HO at the target side (UE X2 signalling
context reference at source eNB, UE S1 EPC signalling context reference,
target cell ID, K~eNB*~, RRC context including the C-RNTI of the UE in the
source eNB, AS-configuration, E-RAB context and physical layer ID of the
source cell + MAC for possible RLF recovery). UE X2 / UE S1 signalling
references enable the target eNB to address the source eNB and the EPC. The
E-RAB context includes necessary RNL and TNL addressing information, and QoS
profiles of the E-RABs.
5 Admission Control may be performed by the target eNB dependent on the
received E-RAB QoS information to increase the likelihood of a successful HO,
if the resources can be granted by target eNB. The target eNB configures the
required resources according to the received E-RAB QoS information and
reserves a C-RNTI and optionally a RACH preamble. The AS-configuration to be
used in the target cell can either be specified independently (i.e. an
\"establishment\") or as a delta compared to the AS-configuration used in the
source cell (i.e. a \"reconfiguration\").
6 Target eNB prepares HO with L1/L2 and sends the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
to the source eNB. The HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message includes a
transparent container to be sent to the UE as an RRC message to perform the
handover. The container includes a new C-RNTI, target eNB security algorithm
identifiers for the selected security algorithms, may include a dedicated RACH
preamble, and possibly some other parameters i.e. access parameters, SIBs,
etc. The HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message may also include RNL/TNL
information for the forwarding tunnels, if necessary.
NOTE: As soon as the source eNB receives the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE, or
as soon as the transmission of the handover command is initiated in the
downlink, data forwarding may be initiated.
Steps 7 to 16 provide means to avoid data loss during HO and are further
detailed in 10.1.2.1.2 and 10.1.2.3.
7 The target eNB generates the RRC message to perform the handover, i.e
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including the
_mobilityControlInformation_ , to be sent by the source eNB towards the UE.
The source eNB performs the necessary integrity protection and ciphering of
the message. The UE receives the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message with
necessary parameters (i.e. new C-RNTI, target eNB security algorithm
identifiers, and optionally dedicated RACH preamble, target eNB SIBs, etc.)
and is commanded by the source eNB to perform the HO. The UE does not need to
delay the handover execution for delivering the HARQ/ARQ responses to source
eNB.
8 The source eNB sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target eNB to
convey the uplink PDCP SN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN transmitter
status of E-RABs for which PDCP status preservation applies (i.e. for RLC AM).
The uplink PDCP SN receiver status includes at least the PDCP SN of the first
missing UL SDU and may include a bit map of the receive status of the out of
sequence UL SDUs that the UE needs to retransmit in the target cell, if there
are any such SDUs. The downlink PDCP SN transmitter status indicates the next
PDCP SN that the target eNB shall assign to new SDUs, not having a PDCP SN
yet. The source eNB may omit sending this message if none of the E-RABs of the
UE shall be treated with PDCP status preservation.
9 After receiving the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including the
_mobilityControlInformation_ , UE performs synchronisation to target eNB and
accesses the target cell via RACH, following a contention-free procedure if a
dedicated RACH preamble was indicated in the _mobilityControlInformation_ , or
following a contention-based procedure if no dedicated preamble was indicated.
UE derives target eNB specific keys and configures the selected security
algorithms to be used in the target cell.
10 The target eNB responds with UL allocation and timing advance.
11 When the UE has successfully accessed the target cell, the UE sends the
_RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete_ message (C-RNTI) to confirm the
handover, along with an uplink Buffer Status Report, whenever possible, to the
target eNB to indicate that the handover procedure is completed for the UE.
The target eNB verifies the C-RNTI sent in the
_RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete_ message. The target eNB can now begin
sending data to the UE.
12 The target eNB sends a PATH SWITCH message to MME to inform that the UE has
changed cell.
13 The MME sends an UPDATE USER PLANE REQUEST message to the Serving Gateway.
14 The Serving Gateway switches the downlink data path to the target side. The
Serving gateway sends one or more \"end marker\" packets on the old path to
the source eNB and then can release any U-plane/TNL resources towards the
source eNB.
15 Serving Gateway sends an UPDATE USER PLANE RESPONSE message to MME.
16 The MME confirms the PATH SWITCH message with the PATH SWITCH ACKNOWLEDGE
message.
17 By sending UE CONTEXT RELEASE, the target eNB informs success of HO to
source eNB and triggers the release of resources by the source eNB. The target
eNB sends this message after the PATH SWITCH ACKNOWLEDGE message is received
from the MME.
18 Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the source eNB can
release radio and C-plane related resources associated to the UE context. Any
ongoing data forwarding may continue.
##### 10.1.2.1.2 U-plane handling
The U-plane handling during the Intra-E-UTRAN-Access mobility activity for UEs
in ECM-CONNECTED takes the following principles into account to avoid data
loss during HO:
\- During HO preparation U-plane tunnels can be established between the source
eNB and the target eNB. There is one tunnel established for uplink data
forwarding and another one for downlink data forwarding for each E-RAB for
which data forwarding is applied.
\- During HO execution, user data can be forwarded from the source eNB to the
target eNB. The forwarding may take place in a service and deployment
dependent and implementation specific way.
\- Forwarding of downlink user data from the source to the target eNB should
take place in order as long as packets are received at the source eNB from the
EPC or the source eNB buffer has not been emptied.
\- During HO completion:
\- The target eNB sends a PATH SWITCH message to MME to inform that the UE has
gained access and MME sends a USER PLANE UPDATE REQUEST message to the Serving
Gateway, the U-plane path is switched by the Serving Gateway from the source
eNB to the target eNB.
\- The source eNB should continue forwarding of U-plane data as long as
packets are received at the source eNB from the Serving Gateway or the source
eNB buffer has not been emptied.
For **RLC-AM bearers** :
\- For in-sequence delivery and duplication avoidance, PDCP SN is maintained
on a bearer basis and the source eNB informs the target eNB about the next DL
PDCP SN to allocate to a packet which does not have a PDCP sequence number yet
(either from source eNB or from the Serving Gateway).
\- For security synchronisation, HFN is also maintained and the source eNB
provides to the target one reference HFN for the UL and one for the DL i.e.
HFN and corresponding SN.
\- In both the UE and the target eNB, a window-based mechanism is needed for
duplication detection.
\- The occurrence of duplicates over the air interface in the target eNB is
minimised by means of PDCP SN based reporting at the target eNB by the UE. In
uplink, the reporting is optionally configured on a bearer basis by the eNB
and the UE should first start by transmitting those reports when granted
resources in the target eNB. In downlink, the eNB is free to decide when and
for which bearers a report is sent and the UE does not wait for the report to
resume uplink transmission.
\- The target eNB re-transmits and prioritizes all downlink PDCP SDUs
forwarded by the source eNB (i.e. the target eNB should send data with PDCP
SNs from X2 before sending data from S1), with the exception of PDCP SDUs of
which the reception was acknowledged through PDCP SN based reporting by the
UE.
\- The UE re-transmits in the target eNB all uplink PDCP SDUs starting from
the first PDCP SDU following the last consecutively confirmed PDCP SDU i.e.
the oldest PDCP SDU that has not been acknowledged at RLC in the source,
excluding the PDCP SDUs of which the reception was acknowledged through PDCP
SN based reporting by the target.
For **RLC-UM bearers** :
\- The PDCP SN and HFN are reset in the target eNB.
\- No PDCP SDUs are retransmitted in the target eNB.
\- The target eNB prioritize all downlink PDCP SDUs forwarded by the source
eNB if any (i.e. the target eNB should send data with PDCP SNs from X2 before
sending data from S1),.
\- The UE PDCP entity does not attempt to retransmit any PDCP SDU in the
target cell for which transmission had been completed in the source cell.
Instead UE PDCP entity starts the transmission with other PDCP SDUs.
#### 10.1.2.2 Path Switch
After the downlink path is switched at the Serving GW downlink packets on the
forwarding path and on the new direct path may arrive interchanged at the
target eNB. The target eNodeB should first deliver all forwarded packets to
the UE before delivering any of the packets received on the new direct path.
The method employed in the target eNB to enforce the correct delivery order of
packets is outside the scope of the standard.
In order to assist the reordering function in the target eNB, the Serving GW
shall send one or more \"end marker\" packets on the old path immediately
after switching the path for each E-RAB of the UE. The \"end marker\" packet
shall not contain user data. The \"end marker\" is indicated in the GTP
header. After completing the sending of the tagged packets the GW shall not
send any further user data packets via the old path.
Upon receiving the \"end marker\" packets, the source eNB shall, if forwarding
is activated for that bearer, forward the packet toward the target eNB.
On detection of an \"end marker\" the target eNB shall discard the end marker
packet and initiate any necessary processing to maintain in sequence delivery
of user data forwarded over X2 interface and user data received from the
serving GW over S1 as a result of the path switch.
On detection of the \"end marker\", the target eNB may also initiate the
release of the data forwarding resource. However, the release of the data
forwarding resource is implementation dependent and could also be based on
other mechanisms (e.g. timer-based mechanism).
EPC may change the uplink end-point of the tunnels with Path Switch procedure.
However, the EPC should keep the old GTP tunnel end-point(s) sufficiently long
time in order to minimise the probability of packet losses and avoid
unintentional release of respective E-RAB(s).
#### 10.1.2.3 Data forwarding
##### 10.1.2.3.1 For RLC-AM DRBs
Upon handover, the source eNB may forward in order to the target eNB all
downlink PDCP SDUs with their SN that have not been acknowledged by the UE. In
addition, the source eNB may also forward without a PDCP SN fresh data
arriving over S1 to the target eNB.
NOTE: Target eNB does not have to wait for the completion of forwarding from
the source eNB before it begins transmitting packets to the UE.
The source eNB discards any remaining downlink RLC PDUs. Correspondingly, the
source eNB does not forward the downlink RLC context to the target eNB.
NOTE: Source eNB does not need to abort on going RLC transmissions with the UE
as it starts data forwarding to the target eNB.
Upon handover, the source eNB forwards to the Serving Gateway the uplink PDCP
SDUs successfully received in-sequence until the sending of the Status
Transfer message to the target eNB. Then at that point of time the source eNB
stops delivering uplink PDCP SDUs to the S-GW and shall discard any remaining
uplink RLC PDUs. Correspondingly, the source eNB does not forward the uplink
RLC context to the target eNB.
Then the source eNB shall either:
\- discard the uplink PDCP SDUs received out of sequence if the source eNB has
not accepted the request from the target eNB for uplink forwarding or if the
target eNB has not requested uplink forwarding for the bearer during the
Handover Preparation procedure,
\- forward to the target eNB the uplink PDCP SDUs received out of sequence if
the source eNB has accepted the request from the target eNB for uplink
forwarding for the bearer during the Handover Preparation procedure.
The PDCP SN of forwarded SDUs is carried in the \"PDCP PDU number\" field of
the GTP-U extension header. The target eNB shall use the PDCP SN if it is
available in the forwarded GTP-U packet.
In-sequence delivery of upper layer PDUs during handover is based on a
continuous PDCP SN and is provided by the \"in-order delivery and duplicate
elimination\" function at the PDCP layer:
\- in the downlink, the \"in-order delivery and duplicate elimination\"
function at the UE PDCP layer guarantees in-sequence delivery of downlink PDCP
SDUs;
\- in the uplink, the \"in-order delivery and duplicate elimination\" function
at the target eNB PDCP layer guarantees in-sequence delivery of uplink PDCP
SDUs.
After handover, when the UE receives a PDCP SDU from the target eNB, it can
deliver it to higher layer together with all PDCP SDUs with lower SNs
regardless of possible gaps.
##### 10.1.2.3.2 For RLC-UM DRBs
Upon handover, the source eNB does not forward to the target eNB downlink PDCP
SDUs for which transmission had been completed in the source cell. PDCP SDUs
that have not been transmitted may be forwarded. In addition, the source eNB
may forward fresh downlink data arriving over S1 to the target eNB. The source
eNB discards any remaining downlink RLC PDUs. Correspondingly, the source eNB
does not forward the downlink RLC context to the target eNB.
Upon handover, the source eNB forwards all uplink PDCP SDUs successfully
received to the Serving Gateway (i.e. including the ones received out of
sequence) and discards any remaining uplink RLC PDUs. Correspondingly, the
source eNB does not forward the uplink RLC context to the target eNB.
##### 10.1.2.3.3 SRB handling
With respect to SRBs, the following principles apply at HO:
\- No forwarding or retransmissions of RRC messages in the target;
\- The PDCP SN and HFN are reset in the target.
#### 10.1.2.4 Void
#### 10.1.2.5 Void
#### 10.1.2.6 Void
#### 10.1.2.7 Timing Advance
In RRC_CONNECTED, the eNB is responsible for maintaining the timing advance.
In some cases (e.g. during DRX), the timing advance is not necessarily always
maintained and the MAC sublayer knows if the L1 is synchronised and which
procedure to use to start transmitting in the uplink:
\- as long as the L1 is non-synchronised, uplink transmission can only take
place on PRACH.
For one UE, cases where the UL synchronisation status moves from
\"synchronised\" to \"non-synchronised\" include:
\- Expiration of a timer;
\- Non-synchronised handover;
The value of the timer is either UE specific and managed through dedicated
signalling between the UE and the eNB, or cell specific and indicated via
broadcast information. In both cases, the timer is normally restarted whenever
a new timing advance is given by the eNB:
\- restarted to a UE specific value if any; or
\- restarted to a cell specific value otherwise.
Upon DL data arrival, dedicated signature on PRACH can be allocated by the eNB
to UE. When a dedicated signature on PRACH is allocated, the UE shall perform
the corresponding random access procedure regardless of its L1 synchronisation
status.
Timing advance updates are signalled by the eNB to the UE in MAC PDUs
addressed via C-RNTI.
### 10.1.3 Measurements
Measurements to be performed by a UE for intra/inter-frequency mobility can be
controlled by E-UTRAN, using broadcast or dedicated control. In RRC_IDLE
state, a UE shall follow the measurement parameters defined for cell
reselection specified by the E-UTRAN broadcast. The use of dedicated
measurement control for RRC_IDLE state is possible through the provision of UE
specific priorities (see sub-clause 10.2.4). In RRC_CONNECTED state, a UE
shall follow the measurement configurations specified by RRC directed from the
E-UTRAN (e.g. as in UTRAN MEASUREMENT_CONTROL).
Intra-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements and inter-frequency neighbour
(cell) measurements are defined as follows:
\- Intra-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements: Neighbour cell measurements
performed by the UE are intra-frequency measurements when the current and
target cell operates on the same carrier frequency. The UE shall be able to
carry out such measurements without measurement gaps.
\- Inter-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements: Neighbour cell measurements
performed by the UE are inter-frequency measurements when the neighbour cell
operates on a different carrier frequency, compared to the current cell. The
UE should not be assumed to be able to carry out such measurements without
measurement gaps.
Whether a measurement is non gap assisted or gap assisted depends on the UE\'s
capability and current operating frequency. The UE determines whether a
particular cell measurement needs to be performed in a transmission/reception
gap and the scheduler needs to know whether gaps are needed:
\- Same carrier frequency and cell bandwidths (Scenario A): an intra-frequency
scenario; not measurement gap assisted.
\- Same carrier frequency, bandwidth of the target cell smaller than the
bandwidth of the current cell (Scenario B): an intra-frequency scenario; not
measurement gap assisted.
\- Same carrier frequency, bandwidth of the target cell larger than the
bandwidth of the current cell (Scenario C): an intra-frequency scenario; not
measurement gap assisted.
\- Different carrier frequencies, bandwidth of the target cell smaller than
the bandwidth of the current cell and bandwidth of the target cell within
bandwidth of the current cell (Scenario D): an inter-frequency scenario;
measurement gap-assisted scenario.
\- Different carrier frequencies, bandwidth of the target cell larger than the
bandwidth of the current cell and bandwidth of the current cell within
bandwidth of the target cell (Scenario E): an inter-frequency scenario;
measurement gap-assisted scenario.
\- Different carrier frequencies and non-overlapping bandwidth, (Scenario F):
an inter-frequency scenario; measurement gap-assisted scenario.
Figure 10.1.3-1: Inter and Intra-frequency measurements scenarios
Measurement gaps patterns are configured and activated by RRC.
#### 10.1.3.1 Intra-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements
In a system with frequency reuse = 1, mobility within the same frequency layer
(i.e. between cells with the same carrier frequency) is predominant. Good
neighbour cell measurements are needed for cells that have the same carrier
frequency as the serving cell in order to ensure good mobility support and
easy network deployment. Search for neighbour cells with the same carrier
frequency as the serving cell, and measurements of the relevant quantities for
identified cells are needed.
NOTE: To avoid UE activity outside the DRX cycle, the reporting criteria for
neighbour cell measurements should match the used DRX cycle.
#### 10.1.3.2 Inter-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements
Regarding mobility between different frequency layers (i.e. between cells with
a different carrier frequency), UE may need to perform neighbour cell
measurements during DL/UL idle periods that are provided by DRX or packet
scheduling (i.e. gap assisted measurements).
### 10.1.4 Paging and C-plane establishment
Paging groups (where multiple UEs can be addressed) are used on PDCCH:
\- Precise UE identity is found on PCH;
\- DRX configurable via BCCH and NAS;
\- Only one subframe allocated per paging interval per UE;
\- The network may divide UEs to different paging occasions in time;
\- There is no grouping within paging occasion;
\- One paging RNTI for PCH.
### 10.1.5 Random Access Procedure
The random access procedure is characterized by:
\- Common procedure for FDD and TDD;
\- One procedure irrespective of cell size;
The random access procedure is performed for the following five events:
\- Initial access from RRC_IDLE;
\- RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure;
\- Handover;
\- DL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access procedure;
> \- E.g. when UL synchronisation status is "non-synchronised";
\- UL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access procedure;
> \- E.g. when UL synchronisation status is \"non-synchronised\" or there are
> no PUCCH resources for SR available.
Furthermore, the random access procedure takes two distinct forms:
\- Contention based (applicable to all five events);
\- Non-contention based (applicable to only handover and DL data arrival).
Normal DL/UL transmission can take place after the random access procedure.
#### 10.1.5.1 Contention based random access procedure
The contention based random access procedure is outlined on Figure 10.1.5.1-1
below:
Figure 10.1.5.1-1: Contention based Random Access Procedure
The four steps of the contention based random access procedures are:
1) Random Access Preamble on RACH in uplink:
> \- There are two possible groups defined and one is optional. If both groups
> are configured the size of message 3 and the pathloss are used to determine
> which group a preamble is selected from. The group to which a preamble
> belongs provides an indication of the size of the message 3 and the radio
> conditions at the UE. The preamble group information along with the
> necessary thresholds are broadcast on system information.
2) Random Access Response generated by MAC on DL-SCH:
\- Semi-synchronous (within a flexible window of which the size is one or more
TTI) with message 1;
\- No HARQ;
\- Addressed to RA-RNTI on PDCCH;
> \- Conveys at least RA-preamble identifier, Timing Alignment information,
> initial UL grant and assignment of Temporary C-RNTI (which may or may not be
> made permanent upon Contention Resolution);
\- Intended for a variable number of UEs in one DL-SCH message.
3) First scheduled UL transmission on UL-SCH:
\- Uses HARQ;
\- Size of the transport blocks depends on the UL grant conveyed in step 2 and
is at least 80 bits.
\- For initial access:
> \- Conveys the RRC Connection Request generated by the RRC layer and
> transmitted via CCCH;
>
> \- Conveys at least NAS UE identifier but no NAS message;
>
> \- RLC TM: no segmentation;
\- For RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure:
\- Conveys the RRC Connection Re-establishment Request generated by the RRC
layer and transmitted via CCCH;
\- RLC TM: no segmentation;
\- Does not contain any NAS message.
\- After handover, in the target cell:
\- Conveys the ciphered and integrity protected RRC Handover Confirm generated
by the RRC layer and transmitted via DCCH;
\- Conveys the C-RNTI of the UE (which was allocated via the Handover
Command);
\- Includes an uplink Buffer Status Report when possible.
\- For other events:
\- Conveys at least the C-RNTI of the UE.
4) Contention Resolution on DL:
\- Early contention resolution shall be used i.e. eNB does not wait for NAS
reply before resolving contention
\- Not synchronised with message 3;
\- HARQ is supported;
\- Addressed to:
\- The Temporary C-RNTI on PDCCH for initial access and after radio link
failure;
\- The C-RNTI on PDCCH for UE in RRC_CONNECTED;
\- HARQ feedback is transmitted only by the UE which detects its own UE
identity, as provided in message 3, echoed in the Contention Resolution
message;
\- For initial access and RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure, no
segmentation is used (RLC-TM).
The Temporary C-RNTI is promoted to C-RNTI for a UE which detects RA success
and does not already have a C-RNTI; it is dropped by others. A UE which
detects RA success and already has a C-RNTI, resumes using its C-RNTI.
#### 10.1.5.2 Non-contention based random access procedure
The non-contention based random access procedure is outlined on Figure
10.1.5.2-1 below:
Figure 10.1.5.2-1: Non-contention based Random Access Procedure
The three steps of the non-contention based random access procedures are:
0) Random Access Preamble assignment via dedicated signalling in DL:
\- eNB assigns to UE a non-contention Random Access Preamble (a Random Access
Preamble not within the set broadcasted on BCH).
\- Signalled via:
> \- HO command generated by target eNB and sent via source eNB for handover;
>
> \- PDCCH in case of DL data arrival.
1) Random Access Preamble on RACH in uplink:
\- UE transmits the assigned non-contention Random Access Preamble.
2) Random Access Response on DL-SCH:
\- Semi-synchronous (within a flexible window of which the size is one or more
TTI) with message 1;
\- No HARQ;
\- Addressed to RA-RNTI on PDCCH;
\- Conveys at least:
> \- Timing Alignment information and initial UL grant for handover;
>
> \- Timing Alignment information for DL data arrival;
>
> \- RA-preamble identifier.
>
> \- Intended for one or multiple UEs in one DL-SCH message.
#### 10.1.5.3 Interaction model between L1 and L2/3 for Random Access
Procedure
Random access procedure described above is modelled in Figure 10.1.5.3-1 below
from L1 and L2/3 interaction point of view. L2/L3 receives indication from L1
whether ACK is received or DTX is detected after indication of Random Access
Preamble transmission to L1. L2/3 indicates L1 to transmit first scheduled UL
transmission (RRC Connection Request in case of initial access) if necessary
or Random Access Preamble based on the indication from L1.
Figure 10.1.5.3-1: Interaction model between L1 and L2/3 for Random Access
Procedure
### 10.1.6 Radio Link Failure
Two phases governs the behaviour associated to radio link failure as shown on
Figure 10.1.6-1:
\- First phase:
\- started upon radio problem detection;
\- leads to radio link failure detection;
\- no UE-based mobility;
\- based on timer or other (e.g. counting) criteria (T~1~).
\- Second Phase:
\- started upon radio link failure detection or handover failure;
\- leads to RRC_IDLE;
\- UE-based mobility;
\- Timer based (T~2~).
Figure 10.1.6-1: Radio Link Failure
Table 10.1.6-1 below describes how mobility is handled with respect to radio
link failure:
Table 10.1.6-1: Mobility and Radio Link Failure

In the Second Phase, in order to resume activity and avoid going via RRC_IDLE
when the UE returns to the same cell or when the UE selects a different cell
from the same eNB, or when the UE selects a cell from a different eNB, the
following procedure applies:
\- The UE stays in RRC_CONNECTED;
\- The UE accesses the cell through the random access procedure;
\- The UE identifier used in the random access procedure for contention
resolution (i.e. Câ€‘RNTI of the UE in the cell where the RLF occurred +
physical layer identity of that cell + MAC based on the keys of that cell) is
used by the selected eNB to authenticate the UE and check whether it has a
context stored for that UE:
\- If the eNB finds a context that matches the identity of the UE, it
indicates to the UE that its connection can be resumed;
\- If the context is not found, RRC connection is released and UE initiates
procedure to establish new RRC connection. In this case UE is required to go
via RRC_IDLE.
### 10.1.7 Radio Access Network Sharing
E-UTRAN shall support radio access network sharing based on support for multi-
to-multi relationship between E-UTRAN nodes and EPC nodes (S1-flex).
If the E-UTRAN is shared by multiple operators, the system information
broadcasted in each shared cell contains the PLMN-id of each operator (up to
6) and a single tracking area code (TAC) valid within all the PLMNs sharing
the radio access network resources.
The UE shall be able to read up to 6 PLMN-ids, to select one of the PLMN-ids
at initial attachment and to indicate this PLMN-id to the E-UTRAN in
subsequent instances of the Random Access procedures (e.g. as defined in
subclause 10.1.5). The E-UTRAN shall select an appropriate MME for the PLMN
indicated by the UE. Once attached to an MME, the UE shall be able to indicate
the allocated MME in subsequent instances of the Random Access procedures. The
indication of the allocated MMEC is contained in the temporary UE identity.
Handling of area restrictions for UE in ECM-CONNECTED shall follow the
principles specified in sub-clause 10.4.
### 10.1.8 Handling of Roaming and Area Restrictions for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED
Handling of roaming/area restrictions and handling of subscription specific
preferences in ECM-CONNECTED is performed in the eNB based on information
provided by the EPC over the S1 interface.
## 10.2 Inter RAT
Service-based redirection between GERAN / UTRAN and E-UTRAN is supported in
both directions. This should not require inter-RAT reporting in RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST.
### 10.2.1 Cell reselection
A UE in RRC_IDLE performs cell reselection. The principles of this procedure
are as follows:
\- The UE makes **measurements** of attributes of the serving and neighbour
cells to enable the reselection process:
\- For a UE to search and measure neighbouring GERAN cells, the ARFCNs of the
BCCH carriers need to be indicated in the serving cell system information
(i.e., an NCL). The NCL does not contain BSICs or cell specific offsets and
Qrxlevmin is given per frequency band.
\- For a UE to search and measure neighbouring UTRAN cells, the serving cell
can indicate an NCL containing a list of carrier frequencies and scrambling
codes.
\- Measurements may be omitted if the serving cell attribute fulfils
particular search or measurement criteria.
\- **Cell reselection** identifies the cell that the UE should camp on. It is
based on cell reselection criteria which involves measurements of the serving
and neighbour cells:
\- Inter-RAT reselection is based on absolute priorities where UE tries to
camp on highest priority RAT available. Absolute priorities for inter-RAT
reselection are provided only by the RPLMN and valid only within the RPLMN;
priorities are given by the system information and valid for all UEs in a
cell, specific priorities per UE can be signalled in the RRC Connection
Release message. A validity time can be associated with UE specific
priorities.
\- It should be possible to prevent the UE from reselecting to specific
detected neighbouring cells;
\- The UE is allowed to \"leave\" the source E-UTRAN cell to read the target
GERAN cell broadcast, in order to determine its \"suitability\", prior to
completing the cell reselection;
\- Cell reselection can be speed dependent (speed detection based on UTRAN
solution);
Cell access restrictions apply as for UTRAN, which consist of access class
(AC) barring and cell reservation (e.g. for cells \"reserved for operator
use\") applicable for mobiles in RRC_IDLE mode.
When performing cell reselection while the UE is camped on another RAT, the
principles of this procedure are as follows:
\- The UE measures attributes of the E-UTRA neighbouring cells:
\- Only the carrier frequencies need to be indicated to enable the UE to
search and measure E-UTRA neighbouring cells;
\- Cell reselection identifies the cell that the UE should camp on. It is
based on cell reselection criteria which involves measurements of the serving
and neighbour cells:
\- For E-UTRA neighbouring cells, there is no need to indicate cell-specific
cell reselection parameters i.e. these parameters are common to all
neighbouring cells on an E-UTRA frequency;
\- Cell reselection parameters are applicable to all UEs in a cell, but it is
possible to configure specific reselection parameters per UE group or per UE.
\- It should be possible to prevent the UE from reselecting to specific
detected neighbouring cells.
### 10.2.2 Handover
Inter RAT HO is designed so that changes to GERAN and UTRAN are minimised.
This can be done by following the principles specified for GERAN to/from UTRAN
intersystem HO. In particular the following principles are applied to E-UTRAN
Inter RAT HO design:
1\. Inter RAT HO is network controlled through source access system. The
source access system decides about starting the preparation and provides the
necessary information to the target system in the format required by the
target system. That is, the source system adapts to the target system. The
actual handover execution is decided in the source system.
2\. Inter RAT HO is backwards handover, i.e. radio resources are prepared in
the target 3GPP access system before the UE is commanded by the source 3GPP
access system to change to the target 3GPP access system.
3\. To enable backwards handover, and while RAN level interfaces are not
available, a control interface exists in CN level. In Inter RAT HO involving
E-UTRAN access, this interface is between 2G/3G SGSN and corresponding
MME/Serving Gateway.
4\. The target access system will be responsible for giving exact guidance for
the UE on how to make the radio access there (this includes radio resource
configuration, target cell system information etc.). This information is given
during the handover preparation and should be transported completely
transparently through the source access system to the UE.
5\. Mechanisms for avoiding or mitigating the loss of user data (i.e.
forwarding) can be used until the 3GPP Anchor determines that it can send DL
U-plane data directly to the target system.
6\. The handover procedure should not require any UE to CN signalling in order
for data to start to flow in the target system. This requires that the
security context, UE capability context and QoS context is transferred (or
translated) within the network between source and target system.
7\. Similar handover procedure should apply for handovers of both real time
and non-real time services.
8\. Similar handover procedure should apply for both Inter RAT Handover and
intra-LTE Handover with EPC node change.
9\. Network controlled mobility is supported even if no prior UE measurements
have been performed on the target cell and/or frequency i.e. "blind HO" is
supported.
### 10.2.2a Inter-RAT cell change order to GERAN with NACC
For interworking towards GERAN, inter-RAT cell change order with NACC is
supported even if no prior UE measurements have been performed on the system
i.e. "blind NACC" is supported.
### 10.2.2b Inter-RAT handovers from E-UTRAN
#### 10.2.2b.1 Data forwarding
##### 10.2.2b.1.1 For RLC-AM bearers
Upon handover, the eNB may forward all downlink PDCP SDUs that have not been
acknowledged by the UE, or all downlink PDCP SDUs that have not been
transmitted to the UE, to the target node. In addition, the eNB may forward
fresh data arriving over S1 to the target node.
NOTE: Any assigned PDCP SNs are not forwarded because of PDCP reset.
NOTE: Target node does not have to wait for the completion of forwarding from
the eNB before it begins transmitting packets to the UE.
The eNB discards any remaining downlink RLC PDUs.
Upon handover, all successfully received PDCP SDUs are delivered to the upper
layers in the UE.
NOTE: eNB does not need to abort ongoing RLC transmissions with the UE as it
starts data forwarding to the target node.
Upon handover, the eNB may forward uplink PDCP SDUs successfully received to
the Serving Gateway and shall discard any remaining uplink RLC PDUs.
Correspondingly, the eNB does not forward the downlink and uplink RLC context.
For the uplink, the UE transmits over the target RAT from the first PDCP SDU
for which transmission has not been attempted in the source cell.
In-sequence delivery of upper layer PDUs during handover is not guaranteed.
##### 10.2.2b.1.2 For RLC-UM bearers
Upon handover, the eNB does not forward to the target node downlink PDCP SDUs
for which transmission had been completed in the source cell. PDCP SDUs that
have not been transmitted may be forwarded. In addition, the eNB may forward
fresh data arriving over S1 to the target node. The eNB discards any remaining
downlink RLC PDUs.
Upon handover, all successfully received PDCP SDUs are delivered to the upper
layers in the UE.
Upon handover, the eNB may forward all uplink PDCP SDUs successfully received
to the Serving Gateway and discards any remaining uplink RLC PDUs.
For the uplink, the UE transmits over the target RAT from the first PDCP SDU
for which transmission has not been attempted in the source cell.
Correspondingly, the eNB does not forward the downlink and uplink RLC context.
### 10.2.3 Measurements
#### 10.2.3.1 Inter-RAT handovers from E-UTRAN
Measurements to be performed by a UE for inter-RAT mobility can be controlled
by E-UTRAN, using broadcast or dedicated control. In RRC_CONNECTED state, a UE
shall follow the measurement parameters specified by RRC directed from the
E-UTRAN (e.g. as in UTRAN MEASUREMENT_CONTROL).
UE performs inter-RAT neighbour cell measurements during DL/UL idle periods
that are provided by the network through suitable DRX/DTX period or packet
scheduling if necessary.
#### 10.2.3.2 Inter-RAT handovers to E-UTRAN
From UTRAN, UE performs E-UTRAN measurements by using idle periods created by
compressed mode (CELL_DCH) or DRX (other states except CELL_FACH).
From GERAN, E-UTRAN measurements are performed in the same way as WCDMA
measurements for handover to UTRAN: E-UTRAN measurements are performed in GSM
idle frames in a time multiplexed manner. However, it should be discussed with
GERAN how to ensure that inter-RAT measurements do not take too much
measurement time, while the requested 3GPP inter-RAT measurements can be
performed well enough.
Design constraints of 3GPP inter-RAT measurements should be considered when L1
details of E-UTRAN concept are defined.
#### 10.2.3.3 Inter-RAT cell reselection from E-UTRAN
In RRC_IDLE state, a UE shall follow the measurement parameters specified by
the E-UTRAN broadcast (as in UTRAN SIB). The use of dedicated measurement
control is possible through the provision of UE specific priorities (see sub-
clause 10.2.4).
#### 10.2.3.4 Limiting measurement load at UE
Introduction of E-UTRA implies co-existence of various UE capabilities. Each
UE may support different combinations of RATs, e.g., E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM, and
non-3GPP RATs, and different combinations of frequency bands, e.g., 800 MHz,
1.7 GHz, 2 GHZ, etc. Despite such heterogeneous environment, the measurement
load at UE should be minimised. To limit the measurement load and the
associated control load:
\- E-UTRAN can configure the RATs to be measured by UE;
\- The number of measurement criteria (event and periodic reporting criteria)
should be limited (as in TS 25.133 subclause 8.3.2 [7]);
\- E-UTRAN should be aware of the UE capabilities for efficient measurement
control, to prevent unnecessary waking up of the measurement entity;
\- Blind HO (i.e., HO without measurement reports from UE) is possible.
### 10.2.4 Network Aspects
Inter-frequency/inter-RAT UE based mobility relies on a "priority based
scheme", where the network configures a list of RATs/frequencies to be taken
as basis for UE's inter-frequency/inter-RAT cell reselection decisions in
priority order. E-UTRAN cells can enable inter-frequency/inter-RAT cell
reselection by broadcasting a common priority valid for all UEs in a given
cell in addition to other inter-frequency/inter-RAT information.
NOTE: The same principles apply in UTRAN.
These common priorities can be overwritten by E-UTRAN through dedicated
signalling to individual UEs at RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE transition.
NOTE: In order to have consistent inter-RAT operation, the same principles
apply to inter-RAT reselection to E-UTRAN. For UTRAN this includes also the
transitions within RRC_CONNECTED state from CELL_DCH to CELL_PCH and URA_PCH.
Setting dedicated priorities by E-UTRAN can be based on subscription related
information provided by the MME.
NOTE: The same principle have been taken as a working assumption in UTRAN
(awaiting for SA2 decision on feasibility of providing subscription related
information by the CN).
## 10.3 Mobility between E-UTRAN and Non-3GPP radio technologies
### 10.3.1 UE Capability Configuration
A UE shall be able to communicate with the E-UTRAN about its radio access
capability, such as the system (including the release and frequency band) it
supports and it's receive and transmit capabilities (single/dual radio, dual
receiver). UE shall transfer its capability about other radio technologies
over E-UTRAN using the same procedure used to carry its E-UTRAN radio
capability.
Since the 1xRTT CSfallback procedures are triggered by the UE, or the 1xRTT
network, there is no need for the eNB to know the UE 1xRTT CSfallback
capability.
### 10.3.2 Mobility between E-UTRAN and cdma2000 network
This section describes the E-UTRAN mechanisms to support idle and active mode
mobility between E-UTRAN and cdma2000 HRPD or 1xRTT. The overall system is
described in [17].
#### 10.3.2.1 Tunnelling of cdma2000 Messages over E-UTRAN between UE and
cdma2000 Access Nodes
In order to efficiently support handover procedures when on E-UTRAN with a
cdma2000 target system, cdma2000 messages are sent transparently to the target
system over the E-UTRAN, with the eNB and MME acting as relay points.
To support the MME in its selection of the correct target system node to which
it should route an Uplink tunnelled message and to provide the target system
with information that is needed to resolve technology-specific measurement
information (RouteUpdate and pilot strength measurements) that are delivered
to the cdma2000 system each eNB cell is associated with a cdma2000 HRPD
SectorID and/or with a cdma2000 1xRTT SectorID (generically referred to as
cdma2000 reference cellid). This cdma2000 reference cellid is provided by the
eNB to the MME using the cdma2000 message transfer capability over S1-AP and
forwarded to the target system via the S101 interface and corresponding
interface to the cdma2000 1xRTT system.
Tunnelling is achieved over the E-UTRAN radio interface by encapsulating
tunnelled cdma2000 messages in the UL Information Transfer (for pre-
registration signalling) or UL Handover Preparation transfer (for handover
signalling) and DL Information Transfer RRC messages (e.g., similar to UMTS
Uplink/Downlink Direct Transfer). The reason for using different UL transfer
messages is so that the UL Handover Preparation transfer messages can use a
higher priority signalling radio bearer. For the UL/DL Information Transfer
messages a specific IE in these RRC messages is used to identify the type of
information contained in the message (e.g., NAS, TunneledMsg). Additionally if
the message is carrying a tunnelled message, an additional IE is included to
carry cdma2000 specific RRC Tunnelling Procedure Information (e.g. RAT type).
AS level security will be applied for these UL Information Transfer / UL
Handover Preparation Transfer and DL Information Transfer RRC messages as
normal but there is no NAS level security for these tunnelled cdma2000
messages.
Figure 10.3.2.1-1: Downlink Direct Transfer
Figure 10.3.2.1-2: Uplink Direct Transfer
Tunnelling to the MME is achieved over the S1-MME interface by encapsulating
the tunnelled cdma2000 message in a new S1 CDMA tunneling messages. These S1
messages carry in addition to the tunneled message some additional cdma2000
specific IEs (e.g. cdma2000 Reference Cell Id, RAT type, cdma2000 message
type).
#### 10.3.2.2 Mobility between E-UTRAN and HRPD
##### 10.3.2.2.1 Mobility from E-UTRAN to HRPD
###### 10.3.2.2.1.1 HRPD System Information Transmission in E-UTRAN
The HRPD system information block (SIB) shall be sent on the E-UTRAN BCCH. The
UE shall monitor the E-UTRAN BCCH during the RRC_IDLE and RRC_CONNECTED modes
to retrieve the HRPD system information for the preparation of cell
reselection or handover from the E-UTRAN to HRPD system. HRPD system
information may also be provided to the UE by means of dedicated signalling.
The HRPD system information contains HRPD neighbouring cell information, cdma
timing information, as well as information controlling the HRPD pre-
registration.
###### 10.3.2.2.1.2 Measuring HRPD from E-UTRAN
Measurement events and parameters for HRPD measurements are to be aligned with
those defined in section 10.2.3.
###### # 10.3.2.2.1.2.1 Idle Mode Measurement Control
UE shall be able to make measurements on the HRPD cells in RRC_IDLE mode to
perform cell re-selection.
The intra-3GPP inter-RAT idle mode measurement control is re-used to control
the idle mode measurements on HRPD. The UE performs measurement on HRPD when
the signal quality from E-UTRAN serving cell falls below a given threshold.
###### # 10.3.2.2.1.2.2 Active Mode Measurement Control
In RRC_CONNECTED mode, the UE shall perform radio measurements on the HRPD
network when directed by the E-UTRAN network. The network provides the
required HRPD neighbour cell list information and measurement controls to the
UE through dedicated RRC signalling. When needed the eNB is responsible for
configuring and activating the HRPD measurements on the UE via the dedicated
RRC signalling message. Periodic and event-triggered measurements are
supported.
For single-radio terminals, measurement gaps are needed to allow the UE to
switch into the HRPD network and do radio measurements. These measurement gaps
are network-controlled. The eNB is responsible for configuring the gap pattern
and providing it to the UE through RRC dedicated signalling. Terminals with a
dual receiver perform measurements on HRPD neighbour cells without tuning away
from the E-UTRAN network. No DL gap patterns will be required for UEs which
are capable of simultaneous reception on the involved frequency bands. No UL
gap patterns will be required for UEs which are capable simultaneous
transmission in one access and measuring on another access.
###### # 10.3.2.2.1.2.3 Active Mode Measurement
In RRC_CONNECTED mode, the UE measures the strengths of each of the HRPD
neighbour cells and reports them in an RRC message.
###### 10.3.2.2.1.3 Pre-registration to HRPD Procedure
Pre-registration allows a UE to establish a presence with an HRPD system in
advance of a cell re-selection or handover. E-UTRAN network instructs the UE
whether the pre-registration is needed over broadcast channel and in a
dedicated RRC message.
The signalling procedure is transparent to E-UTRAN network. In the pre-
registration to HRPD, messages shall be tunnelled inside RRC and S1-AP
messages between the UE and MME and in a generic \"transfer\" message between
source MME and target accesss network.
The UE is responsible for maintaining the HRPD context e.g. by performing
periodic re-registrations if needed. The UE will use pre-registration zone
information (including the current HRPD Pre-registration Zone and a list of
HRPD Secondary Pre-registration Zone ID) to decide whether a re-registration
shall be performed. A dual-receiver UE can ignore the parameter. E-UTRAN will
provide the pre-registration zone information on the E-UTRAN system
information broadcast channel or dedicated RRC signalling (unless it is
determined that the UE will read the E-UTRAN system information broadcast
channel in RRC_CONNECTED). Re-registrations are only allowed in areas where
pre-registration is requested.
The managing of pre-registration and re-registration is handled by HRPD upper
layer. The UE should indicate if it is pre-registered when sending measurement
reports on cdma2000 cells.
###### 10.3.2.2.1.4 E-UTRAN to HRPD Cell Re-selection
For the \"Optimized Idle-mode Mobility\" in [19], the pre-condition for cell
re-selection from E-UTRAN to HRPD is that the UE has previously established a
presence in the target HRPD network, either through the pre-registration
procedure or previous HRPD attachment.
For the \"Non-optimized Handover\" in [19], the above pre-condition does not
apply.
The UE performs Cell re-selection to HRPD while in RRC_IDLE.
Cell reselection from E-UTRAN to HRPD should be aligned with 3GPP inter RAT
cell reselection mechanism.
###### 10.3.2.2.1.5 E-UTRAN to HRPD Handover
The pre-condition for the E-UTRAN to HRPD Handover procedure is that the UE is
attached in the E-UTRAN network in E-UTRAN_ACTIVE state and has pre-registered
with the HRPD network. Based on measurement reports received from the UE the
eNB initiates a handover by sending an RRC Handover FROM E-UTRA PREPARATION
REQUEST message to the UE to indicate to the UE that it should begin the
handover procedure. This message shall include the specified target RAT type
and any cdma2000 specific HRPD parameters needed by the UE to create the
appropriate HRPD messages needed to request a connection. Upon reception of
this message the UE should begin handover signalling towards the HRPD access.
The HRPD handover signalling is tunnelled through E-UTRAN between the UE and
HRPD network. These HRPD parameters and HRPD messages are transparent to
E-UTRAN. The set of the required HRPD parameters are out of scope of this
specification.
The messages are transferred inside RRC transfer messages and S1 CDMA2000
tunneling messages. The MME will, based on indication provided by the HRPD
network, get information about if the handover succeeded or failed making it
possible for the MME set the handover status in the S1 CDMA2000 tunneling
messages (e.g. handover success, handover failure). In case the handover
succeeded E-UTRAN will include the tunnelled "CDMA2000 handover command",
which will be sent to the UE, inside the RRC MOBILITY from E-UTRA message.
The UE can continue to send and receive data on the E-UTRAN radio until it
receives the RRC MOBILITY from E-UTRA message including a tunnelled "CDMA2000
handover command". After this message is received by the UE, the UE shall
leave the E-UTRAN radio and start acquiring the HRPD traffic channel. The HRPD
handover signalling is tunnelled between the UE and HRPD network.
##### 10.3.2.2.2 Mobility from HRPD to E-UTRAN
Mobility from HRPD to E-UTRAN has no impact on the E-UTRAN.
#### 10.3.2.3 Mobility between E-UTRAN and cdma2000 1xRTT
##### 10.3.2.3.1 Mobility from E-UTRAN to cdma2000 1xRTT
###### 10.3.2.3.1.1 cdma2000 1xRTT System Information Transmission in E-UTRAN
The cdma2000 1xRTT system information block (SIB) shall be sent on E-UTRAN
BCCH. The UE shall monitor the E-UTRAN BCCH during the LTE_IDLE and
RRC_CONNECTED modes to retrieve the 1xRTT system information for the
preparation of handover from the E-UTRAN to cdma 2000 1xRTT system. 1xRTT
system information may also be provided to the UE by means of dedicated
signalling. The 1xRTT system information contains 1xRTT neighbouring cell
information and cdma timing information, as well as information controlling
the 1xRTT pre-registration for 1xCS Fallback.
###### 10.3.2.3.1.2 Measuring cdma2000 1xRTT from E-UTRAN
Measurement events and parameters for 1xRTT measurements are to be aligned
with those defined in section 10.2.3.
###### 10.3.2.3.1.2.1 Idle Mode Measurement Control
UE shall be able to make measurements on the 1xRTT system cells in LTE_IDLE
mode to perform cell re-selection. UE shall perform cdma2000 1xRTT neighbour
cell measurements during DRX periods, between paging occasions.
The intra-3GPP inter-RAT idle mode measurement control is re-used to control
the idle mode measurements on cdma2000 1xRTT. The UE performs measurement on
cdma2000 1xRTT when the signal quality from E-UTRAN serving cell falls below a
given threshold.
###### 10.3.2.3.1.2.2 Active Mode Measurement Control
In the E-UTRAN network, in RRC_CONNECTED mode, the UE shall perform radio
measurements on the cdma2000 1xRTT network when directed by the E-UTRAN
network. The network provides the required cdma2000 1xRTT neighbour cell list
information and measurement controls to the UE through dedicated RRC
signalling. When needed the eNB is responsible for configuring and activating
the cdma2000 1xRTT measurements on the UE via the dedicated RRC signalling
message. As for intra-3GPP inter-RAT measurement reporting, periodic and
event-triggered measurements are supported.
For single-radio terminals, measurement gaps are needed to allow the UE to
switch into the cdma2000 1xRTT network and do radio measurements. These
Measurement gaps are network-controlled. The eNB is responsible for
configuring the gap pattern and providing it to the UE through RRC dedicated
signalling. Terminals with a dual receiver perform measurements on cdma2000
1xRTT neighbour cells without tuning away from the E-UTRAN network. No DL gap
patterns will be required for UEs which are capable of simultaneous reception
on the involved frequency bands. No UL gap patterns will be required for UEs
which are capable simultaneous transmission in one access and measuring on
another access.
###### 10.3.2.3.1.2.3 Active Mode Measurement
In RRC_CONNECTED mode, the UE measures the strengths of each of the cdma2000
1xRTT neighbour cells and reports them in an RRC Message.
###### 10.3.2.3.1.3 E-UTRAN to cdma2000 1xRTT Cell Re-selection
UE performs Cell re-selection to cdma2000 1xRTT while in RRC_IDLE.
Cell reselection from E-UTRAN to 1xRTT should be aligned with 3GPP inter RAT
cell reselection mechanism.
###### 10.3.2.3.1.4 E-UTRAN to cdma2000 1xRTT Handover
In the high level procedure for handover from E-UTRAN to cdma2000 1xRTT except
1xRTT CS Fallback, registration and handover is performed directly after the
handover decision has been made. Based on measurement reports received from
the UE the eNB initiates a handover by sending a RRC Handover FROM E-UTRA
PREPARATION REQUEST message to the UE to indicate to the UE that it should
begin the handover procedure. This message shall include the specified target
RAT type and any cdma2000 specific 1xRTT access parameters needed by the UE to
create the appropriate 1xRTT Origination Request message. The 1xRTT handover
signalling is tunnelled between the UE and 1xRTT network. The 1xRTT access
parameters and 1xRTT messages are transparent to E-UTRAN. The set of the
required 1xRTT access parameters are out of scope of this specification.
The messages are transferred inside RRC transfer messages and S1 CDMA2000
tunneling messages. The MME will, based on indication provided by the 1xRTT
network, get information about if the handover succeeded or failed making it
possible for the MME set the handover status in the S1 CDMA2000 tunneling
messages (e.g. handover success, handover failure). In case the handover
succeeded E-UTRAN will include the tunnelled "CDMA2000 handover command",
which will be sent to the UE, inside the RRC MOBILITY from E-UTRA message.
The UE can continue to send and receive data on the E-UTRAN radio until it
receives the RRC MOBILITY from E-UTRA message including a tunnelled "CDMA2000
handover command". After this message is received by the UE, the UE shall
leave the E-UTRAN radio and start acquiring the 1xRTT traffic channel.
##### 10.3.2.3.2 Mobility from cdma2000 1xRTT to E-UTRAN
Mobility from cdma2000 1xRTT has no impact on E-UTRAN.
##### 10.3.2.3.3 1xRTT CS Fallback
CS fallback for 1xRTT enables the delivery of CS-domain services when a UE is
being served by the E-UTRAN [23]. A CS fallback enabled terminal, while
connected to the E-UTRAN may pre-register in the 1xRTT CS domain in order to
use the 1xRTT access network to establish both terminating and originating
1xRTT calls in the CS domain. The 1xRTT signalling (pre-registration and
Paging) between UE and CDMA network is transparent to E-UTRAN. The 1xRTT
messages shall be tunnelled inside RRC and S1-AP messages between the UE and
MME and in a generic \"transfer\" message between source MME and target 1xRTT
access network.
##### 10.3.2.3.3.1 Pre-registration Procedure for 1xRTT CSFB {#pre-
registration-procedure-for-1xrtt-csfb .H6}
Pre-registration allows a UE to establish a presence with the 1xRTT network in
advance of a 1xCSfallback. E-UTRAN network instructs the UE whether the 1xRTT
pre-registration is needed over broadcast channel. Before performing a 1xRTT
pre-registration, the UE requests from the eNB the necessary information to
perform the 1xRTT pre-registration using _CDMA2000-CSFBParametersRequest_
message. The eNB provides the necessary parameters in the response
_CDMA2000-CSFBParametersResponse._ These necessary parameters are pre-
configured in the eNB and are transparent to E-UTRAN.
The UE is responsible for maintaining the 1xRTT context e.g. by performing
periodic re-registrations if needed. The UE will use the 1xRTT pre-
registration information to decide whether a re-registration shall be
performed. A dual-receiver UE can ignore these parameters. Re-registrations
are only allowed in areas where pre-registration is requested.
The management of the pre-registration and re-registration is handled by the
1xRTT upper layer in the UE.
## 10.4 Area Restrictions
The area restriction information for a UE includes the Serving PLMN, and may
include a list of equivalent PLMNs, and information on which area restrictions
are to be applied during ECM-CONNECTED state. It may be provided by the MME at
context setup over the S1 interface, and may be updated by the MME during S1
Handover, and when sending NAS Downlink messages.The eNB shall store the UE
area restriction information and use it to determine whether the UE has access
to radio resources in the E-UTRAN and/or other RANs. The source eNB should
apply restriction handling when selecting a target cell.
The available UE area restriction information shall be propagated by the
source eNB over X2 at intra E-UTRAN handover. For the case when the X2
handover results in a change of serving PLMN (to an equivalent PLMN), the
source eNB shall replace the Serving PLMN with the identity of the target PLMN
and move the Serving PLMN to the equivalent PLMN list, before propagating the
UE area restriction information.
## 10.5 Mobility to and from CSG cells
### 10.5.0 Principles for idle-mode mobility with CSG cells
#### 10.5.0.1 Intra-frequency mobility
Intra-frequency mobility in idle mode in the presence of "allowed" CSG cells
(_i.e._ , CSG cells that the UE is allowed to camp on) is based on cell
ranking and reselection using the "best cell principle": For cell ranking and
reselection, the UE may ignore all CSG cells that are known by the UE to be
not allowed.
#### 10.5.0.2 Inter-frequency mobility
For cell ranking and reselection, the UE should prioritize CSG cells with CSG
ID present in the UE's allowed CSG list, irrespective of normal network
configured frequency priorities.
#### 10.5.0.3 Inter-RAT Mobility
Inter-RAT inbound mobility to E-UTRAN CSG cells is also supported by a UE
autonomous search when the UE is camped on a RAT other than E-UTRAN. The UE
requirements are defined in the specifications of the concerned RAT.
### 10.5.1 Inbound mobility to CSG cells
#### 10.5.1.1 RRC_IDLE
Cell selection/reselection to CSG cells is based on a UE autonomous search
function. The search function determines itself when/where to search, and need
not be assisted by the network with information about frequencies which are
dedicated to CSG cells.
To assist the search function on mixed carriers, all CSG cells on mixed
carriers broadcast in system information a range of PCI values reserved by the
network for use by CSG cells. Optionally also non-CSG cells on the mixed
carrier can send this information in system information. The reserved PCI
range is only applicable to the frequency of the PLMN where the UE received
this information. The UE considers the last received reserved range of PCI
values for CSG cells to be valid for a maximum of 24 hours within the entire
PLMN. UE's use of the received PCI split information is UE implementation
dependent.
UE checks the suitability of CSG cells (identified by the 1 bit indicator)
based on the allowed CSG list in the UE (provided by upper layers). A CSG cell
is only suitable for a UE if it belongs to its allowed CSG list.
The automated searching for the CSG cells by the UE shall be disabled by the
search function, if the allowed CSG list configured in the UE is empty.
In addition, manual selection of CSG cells is supported.
Cell selection/reselection to CSG cells does not require the network to
provide neighbour cell information to the UE. The neighbour cell information
can be provided to help the UE in specific cases, e.g. where the network
wishes to trigger the UE to search for CSG cells.
Cell Reselection between allowed CSG cells is based on normal cell reselection
procedure.
#### 10.5.1.2 RRC_CONNECTED
While the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED state, the UE performs normal measurement and
mobility procedures based on configuration provided by the network.
The UE is not required to support manual selection of CSG IDs while in
RRC_CONNECTED state.
### 10.5.2 Outbound mobility from CSG cells
#### 10.5.2.1 RRC_IDLE
For a UE leaving a CSG cell in idle mode normal cell reselection based on
configuration from the BCCH of the CSG cell applies.
#### 10.5.2.2 RRC_CONNECTED
For a UE leaving a CSG cell in active mode normal network controlled mobility
applies.
## 10.6 Measurement Model
Figure 10.6-1: Measurement model
  * **A:** measurements (samples) internal to the physical layer.
  * **Layer 1 filtering:** internal layer 1 filtering of the inputs measured at point A. Exact filtering is implementation dependant. How the measurements are actually executed in the physical layer by an implementation (inputs A and Layer 1 filtering) in not constrained by the standard.
  * **B:** A measurement reported by layer 1 to layer 3 after layer 1 filtering.
  * **Layer 3 filtering:** Filtering performed on the measurements provided at point B. The behaviour of the Layer 3 filters are standardised and the configuration of the layer 3 filters is provided by RRC signalling. Filtering reporting period at C equals one measurement period at B.
  * **C:** A measurement after processing in the layer 3 filter. The reporting rate is identical to the reporting rate at point B. This measurement is used as input for one or more evaluation of reporting criteria.
  * **Evaluation of reporting criteria:** This checks whether actual measurement reporting is necessary at point D. The evaluation can be based on more than one flow of measurements at reference point C e.g. to compare between different measurements. This is illustrated by input C and C\'. The UE shall evaluate the reporting criteria at least every time a new measurement result is reported at point C, C\'. The reporting criteria are standardised and the configuration is provided by RRC signalling (UE measurements).
  * **D:** Measurement report information (message) sent on the radio interface.
Layer 1 filtering will introduce a certain level of measurement averaging. How
and when the UE exactly performs the required measurements will be
implementation specific to the point that the output at B fulfils the
performance requirements set in [21]. Layer 3 filtering and parameters used is
specified in [16] and does not introduce any delay in the sample availability
between B and C. Measurement at point C, C\' is the input used in the event
evaluation.
# 11 Scheduling and Rate Control
In order to utilise the SCH resources efficiently, a scheduling function is
used in MAC. In this subclause, an overview of the scheduler is given in terms
of scheduler operation, signalling of scheduler decisions, and measurements to
support scheduler operation.
## 11.1 Basic Scheduler Operation
MAC in eNB includes dynamic resource schedulers that allocate physical layer
resources for the DL-SCH and UL-SCH transport channels. Different schedulers
operate for the DL-SCH and UL-SCH.
The scheduler should take account of the traffic volume and the QoS
requirements of each UE and associated radio bearers, when sharing resources
between UEs. Only "per UE" grants are used to grant the right to transmit on
the UL-SCH (i.e. there are no "per UE per RB" grants).
Schedulers may assign resources taking account the radio conditions at the UE
identified through measurements made at the eNB and/or reported by the UE.
Radio resource allocations can be valid for one or multiple TTIs.
Resource assignment consists of physical resource blocks (PRB) and MCS.
Allocations for time periods longer than one TTI might also require additional
information (allocation time, allocation repetition factor...).
### 11.1.1 Downlink Scheduling
In the downlink, E-UTRAN can dynamically allocate resources (PRBs and MCS) to
UEs at each TTI via the C-RNTI on PDCCH(s). A UE always monitors the PDCCH(s)
in order to find possible allocation when its downlink reception is enabled
(activity governed by DRX when configured).
In addition, E-UTRAN can allocate semi-persistent downlink resources for the
first HARQ transmissions to UEs:
\- RRC defines the periodicity of the semi-persistent downlink grant;
\- PDCCH indicates whether the downlink grant is a semi-persistent one i.e.
whether it can be implicitly reused in the following TTIs according to the
periodicity defined by RRC.
When required, retransmissions are explicitly signalled via the PDCCH(s). In
the sub-frames where the UE has semi-persistent downlink resource, if the UE
cannot find its C-RNTI on the PDCCH(s), a downlink transmission according to
the semi-persistent allocation that the UE has been assigned in the TTI is
assumed. Otherwise, in the sub-frames where the UE has semi-persistent
downlink resource, if the UE finds its C-RNTI on the PDCCH(s), the PDCCH
allocation overrides the semi-persistent allocation for that TTI and the UE
does not decode the semi-persistent resources.
### 11.1.2 Uplink Scheduling
In the uplink, E-UTRAN can dynamically allocate resources (PRBs and MCS) to
UEs at each TTI via the C-RNTI on PDCCH(s). A UE always monitors the PDCCH(s)
in order to find possible allocation for uplink transmission when its downlink
reception is enabled (activity governed by DRX when configured).
In addition, E-UTRAN can allocate a semi-persistent uplink resource for the
first HARQ transmissions and potentially retransmissions to UEs:
\- RRC defines the periodicity of the semi-persistent uplink grant;
\- PDCCH indicates whether the uplink grant is a semi-persistent one i.e.
whether it can be implicitly reused in the following TTIs according to the
periodicity defined by RRC.
In the sub-frames where the UE has semi-persistent uplink resource, if the UE
cannot find its C-RNTI on the PDCCH(s), an uplink transmission according to
the semi-persistent allocation that the UE has been assigned in the TTI can be
made. The network performs decoding of the pre-defined PRBs according to the
pre-defined MCS. Otherwise, in the sub-frames where the UE has semi-persistent
uplink resource, if the UE finds its C-RNTI on the PDCCH(s), the PDCCH
allocation overrides the persistent allocation for that TTI and the UE's
transmission follows the PDCCH allocation, not the semi-persistent allocation.
Retransmissions are either implicitly allocated in which case the UE uses the
semi-persistent uplink allocation, or explicitly allocated via PDCCH(s) in
which case the UE does not follow the semi-persistent allocation.
NOTE: there is no blind decoding in uplink and when the UE does not have
enough data to fill the allocated resource, padding is used.
## 11.2 Void
## 11.3 Measurements to Support Scheduler Operation
Measurement reports are required to enable the scheduler to operate in both
uplink and downlink. These include transport volume and measurements of a UEs
radio environment.
Uplink buffer status reports (BSR) are needed to provide support for QoS-aware
packet scheduling. In E-UTRAN uplink buffer status reports refer to the data
that is buffered in for a group of radio bearer (RBG) in the UE. Four RBGs and
two formats are used for reporting in uplink:
> \- A short format for which only one BSR (of one RBG) is reported;
>
> \- A long format for which all four BSRs (of all four RBGs) are reported.
Uplink buffer status reports are transmitted using MAC signalling.
## 11.4 Rate Control of GBR and UE-AMBR
### 11.4.1 Downlink
The eNB guarantees the downlink GBR associated with a GBR bearer and enforces
the downlink AMBR associated with a group of Non-GBR bearers.
### 11.4.2 Uplink
The UE has an uplink rate control function which manages the sharing of uplink
resources between radio bearers. RRC controls the uplink rate control function
by giving each bearer a priority and a prioritised bit rate (PBR). The values
signalled may not be related to the ones signalled via S1 to the eNB.
The uplink rate control function ensures that the UE serves its radio
bearer(s) in the following sequence:
1\. All the radio bearer(s) in decreasing priority order up to their PBR;
2\. All the radio bearer(s) in decreasing priority order for the remaining
resources assigned by the grant.
NOTE1: In case the PBRs are all set to zero, the first step is skipped and the
radio bearer(s) are served in strict priority order: the UE maximises the
transmission of higher priority data.
NOTE2: By limiting the total grant to the UE, the eNB can ensure that the UE-
AMBR is not exceeded.
If more than one radio bearer has the same priority, the UE shall serve these
radio bearers equally.
## 11.5 CQI reporting for Scheduling
The time and frequency resources used by the UE to report CQI are under the
control of the eNB. CQI reporting can be either periodic or aperiodic. A UE
can be configured to have both periodic and aperiodic reporting at the same
time. In case both periodic and aperiodic reporting occurs in the same
subframe, only the aperiodic report is transmitted in that subframe.
For efficient support of localized, distributed and MIMO transmissions, E-UTRA
supports three types of CQI reporting:
\- Wideband type: providing channel quality information of entire system
bandwidth of the cell;
\- Multi-band type: providing channel quality information of some subset(s) of
system bandwidth of the cell;
\- MIMO type: open loop or closed loop operation (with or without PMI
feedback).
Periodic CQI reporting is defined by the following characteristics:
\- When the UE is allocated PUSCH resources in a subframe where a periodic CQI
report is configured to be sent, the periodic CQI report is transmitted
together with uplink data on the PUSCH. Otherwise, the periodic CQI reports
are sent on the PUCCH.
Aperiodic CQI reporting is defined by the following characteristics:
> \- The report is scheduled by the eNB via the PDCCH;
>
> \- Transmitted together with uplink data on PUSCH.
When a CQI report is transmitted together with uplink data on PUSCH, it is
multiplexed with the transport block by L1 (i.e. the CQI report is not part of
the uplink the transport block).
The eNB configures a set of sizes and formats of the reports. Size and format
of the report depends on whether it is transmitted over PUCCH or PUSCH and
whether it is a periodic or aperiodic CQI report.
# 12 DRX in RRC_CONNECTED
In order to enable reasonable UE battery consumption, DRX in E-UTRAN is
characterised by the following:
\- Per UE mechanism (as opposed to per radio bearer);
\- No RRC or MAC substate to distinguish between different levels of DRX;
\- Available DRX values are controlled by the network and start from non-DRX
up to _x_ seconds. Value _x_ may be as long as the paging DRX used in ECM-
IDLE;
\- Measurement requirement and reporting criteria can differ according to the
length of the DRX interval i.e. long DRX intervals may experience more relaxed
requirements;
\- Irrespective of DRX, UE may use first available RACH opportunity to send an
UL measurement report;
\- Immediately after sending a measurement report, the UE may change its DRX.
This mechanism would be pre-configured by the eNB;
\- HARQ operation related to data transmission is independent of DRX operation
and the UE wakes up to read the PDCCH for possible retransmissions and/or
ACK/NAK signalling regardless of DRX In the downlink, a timer is used to limit
the time the UE stays awake awaiting for a retransmission;
\- When DRX is configured, the UE may be further configured with an \"on-
duration\" timer during which time the UE monitors the PDCCHs for possible
allocations;
\- When DRX is configured, periodic CQI reports can only be sent by the UE
during the "active-time". RRC can further restrict periodic CQI reports so
that they are only sent during the on-duration;
\- A timer in the UE is used to detect need for obtaining timing advance.
The following definitions apply to DRX in E-UTRAN:
\- **on-duration** : duration in downlink subframes that the UE waits for,
after waking up from DRX, to receive PDCCHs. If the UE successfully decodes a
PDCCH, the UE stays awake and starts the inactivity timer;
\- **inactivity-timer** : duration in downlink subframes that the UE waits to
successfully decode a PDCCH, from the last successful decoding of a PDCCH,
failing which it re-enters DRX. The UE shall restart the inactivity timer
following a single successful decoding of a PDCCH for a first transmission
only (i.e. not for retransmissions).
\- **active-time** : total duration that the UE is awake. This includes the
"on-duration" of the DRX cycle, the time UE is performing continuous reception
while the inactivity timer has not expired and the time UE is performing
continuous reception while waiting for a DL retransmission after one HARQ RTT.
Based on the above the minimum active time is of length equal to on-duration,
and the maximum is undefined (infinite);
Of the above parameters the on-duration and inactivity-timer are of fixed
lengths, while the active-time is of varying lengths based on scheduling
decision and UE decoding success. Only on-duration and inactivity-timer
duration are signalled to the UE by the eNB:
\- There is only one DRX configuration applied in the UE at any time;
\- UE shall apply an on-duration on wake-up from DRX sleep;
NOTE: this is also applicable for the case where the UE has only one service
(e.g. Real Time) that is being handled through the allocation of predefined
resources; this allows for other signalling such as RRC to be sent during the
remaining portion of the active time.
\- New transmissions can only take place during the active-time (so that when
the UE is waiting for one retransmission only, it does not have to be "awake"
during the RTT).
\- If PDCCH has not been successfully decoded during the on-duration, the UE
shall follow the DRX configuration (i.e. the UE can enter DRX sleep if allowed
by the DRX configuration):
\- This applies also for the sub-frames where the UE has been allocated
predefined resources.
> \- If it successfully decodes a PDCCH for a first transmission, the UE shall
> stay awake and start the inactivity timer (even if a PDCCH is successfully
> decoded in the sub-frames where the UE has also been allocated predefined
> resources) until a MAC control message tells the UE to re-enter DRX, or
> until the inactivity timer expires. In both cases, the DRX cycle that the UE
> follows after re-entering DRX is given by the following rules:
\- If a short DRX cycle is configured; the UE first follows the short DRX
cycle and after a longer period of inactivity the UE follows the long DRX
cycle;
\- Else the UE follows the long DRX cycle directly.
NOTE: When DRX is configured, the network should detect whether UE remains in
EUTRAN coverage by requesting UE to send periodic signals to the network.
# 13 QoS
An EPS bearer/E-RAB is the level of granularity for bearer level QoS control
in the EPC/E-UTRAN. That is, SDFs mapped to the same EPS bearer receive the
same bearer level packet forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling policy, queue
management policy, rate shaping policy, RLC configuration, etc.) [17].
One EPS bearer/E-RAB is established when the UE connects to a PDN, and that
remains established throughout the lifetime of the PDN connection to provide
the UE with always-on IP connectivity to that PDN. That bearer is referred to
as the _default_ bearer. Any additional EPS bearer/E-RAB that is established
to the same PDN is referred to as a _dedicated_ bearer. The initial bearer
level QoS parameter values of the default bearer are assigned by the network,
based on subscription data. The decision to establish or modify a dedicated
bearer can only be taken by the EPC, and the bearer level QoS parameter values
are always assigned by the EPC.
An EPS bearer/E-RAB is referred to as a GBR bearer if dedicated network
resources related to a Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) value that is associated with
the EPS bearer/E-RAB are permanently allocated (e.g. by an admission control
function in the eNodeB) at bearer establishment/modification. Otherwise, an
EPS bearer/E-RAB is referred to as a Non-GBR bearer. A dedicated bearer can
either be a GBR or a Non-GBR bearer while a default bearer shall be a Non-GBR
bearer.
## 13.1 Bearer service architecture
The EPS bearer service layered architecture is depicted in Figure 13.1-1
below, where:
\- An UL TFT in the UE binds an SDF to an EPS bearer in the uplink direction.
Multiple SDFs can be multiplexed onto the same EPS bearer by including
multiple uplink packet filters in the UL TFT.
\- A DL TFT in the PDN GW binds an SDF to an EPS bearer in the downlink
direction. Multiple SDFs can be multiplexed onto the same EPS bearer by
including multiple downlink packet filters in the DL TFT.
\- An E-RAB transports the packets of an EPS bearer between the UE and the
EPC. When an E-RAB exists, there is a one-to-one mapping between this E-RAB
and an EPS bearer.
\- A data radio bearer transports the packets of an EPS bearer between a UE
and an eNB. When a data radio bearer exists, there is a one-to-one mapping
between this data radio bearer and the EPS bearer/E-RAB.
\- An S1 bearer transports the packets of an E-RAB between an eNodeB and a
Serving GW.
\- An S5/S8 bearer transports the packets of an EPS bearer between a Serving
GW and a PDN GW.
\- A UE stores a mapping between an uplink packet filter and a data radio
bearer to create the binding between an SDF and a data radio bearer in the

Figure 13.1-1: EPS Bearer Service Architecture
## 13.2 QoS parameters
The bearer level (i.e. per bearer or per bearer aggregate) QoS parameters are
QCI, ARP, GBR, and AMBR [17]. Each EPS bearer/E-RAB (GBR and Non-GBR) is
associated with the following bearer level QoS parameters:
\- QoS Class Identifier (QCI): scalar that is used as a reference to access
node-specific parameters that control bearer level packet forwarding treatment
(e.g. scheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue management thresholds,
link layer protocol configuration, etc.), and that have been pre-configured by
the operator owning the eNodeB. A one-to-one mapping of standardized QCI
values to standardized characteristics is captured in [17].
\- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP): the primary purpose of ARP is to
decide whether a bearer establishment / modification request can be accepted
or needs to be rejected in case of resource limitations. In addition, the ARP
can be used by the eNodeB to decide which bearer(s) to drop during exceptional
resource limitations (e.g. at handover).
Each GBR bearer is additionally associated with the following bearer level QoS
parameter:
\- Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR): the bit rate that can be expected to be provided
by a GBR bearer,
Each APN access, by a UE, is associated with the following QoS parameter:
\- per APN Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (APN-AMBR).
Each UE in state EMM-REGISTERED is associated with the following bearer
aggregate level QoS parameter:
\- per UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (UE-AMBR).
The definitions of APN AMBR and UE-AMBR are captured in [17].
The GBR denotes bit rate of traffic per bearer while UE-AMBR/APN-AMBR denote
bit rate of traffic per group of bearers. Each of those QoS parameters has an
uplink and a downlink component.
# 14 Security
## 14.1 Overview and Principles
The following principles apply to E-UTRAN security:
\- The keys used for NAS and AS protection shall be dependent on the algorithm
with which they are used.
\- The eNB keys are cryptographically separated from the EPC keys used for NAS
protection (making it impossible to use the eNB key to figure out an EPC key).
\- The AS (RRC and UP) and NAS keys are derived in the EPC/UE from key
material that was generated by a NAS (EPC/UE) level AKA procedure (K~ASME~)
and identified with a key identifier (KSI~ASME~).
\- The eNB key (K~eNB~) is sent from the EPC to the eNB when the UE is
entering ECM-CONNECTED state (i.e. during RRC connection or S1 context setup).
\- Separate AS and NAS level security mode command procedures are used. AS
level security mode command procedure configures AS security (RRC and user
plane) and NAS level security mode command procedure configures NAS security.
Both integrity protection and ciphering for RRC are activated within the same
AS SMC procedure, but not necessarily within the same message. User plane
ciphering is activated at the same time as RRC ciphering.
\- Keys stored inside eNBs shall never leave a secure environment within the
eNB (except when done in accordance with this or other 3GPP specifications),
and user plane data ciphering/deciphering shall take place inside the secure
environment where the related keys are stored.
\- Key material for the eNB keys is sent between the eNBs during ECM-CONNECTED
intra-E-UTRAN mobility.
\- A sequence number (COUNT) is used as input to the ciphering and integrity
protection. A given sequence number must only be used once for a given eNB key
(except for identical re-transmission) on the same radio bearer in the same
direction. The same sequence number can be used for both ciphering and
integrity protection.
\- A hyper frame number (HFN) (i.e. an overflow counter mechanism) is used in
the eNB and UE in order to limit the actual number of sequence number bits
that is needed to be sent over the radio. The HFN needs to be synchronized
between the UE and eNB.
\- If corruption of keys is detected, UE has to restart radio level attachment
procedure (e.g. similar radio level procedure to idle-to-connected mode
transition or initial attachment).
\- No integrity protection initialisation number (FRESH).
\- Since SIM access is not granted in E-UTRAN [24], idle mode UE not equipped
with USIM shall not attempt to reselect to E-UTRAN. To prevent handover to
E-UTRAN, UE not equipped with USIM shall not indicate E-UTRA support in UE
capability signalling in other RATs.
A simplified key derivation is depicted on Figure 14.1-1 below, where:
**\- K~NASint~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of NAS
traffic with a particular integrity algorithm This key is derived by UE and
MME from K~ASME\ ,~ as well as an identifier for the integrity algorithm.
**\- K~NASenc~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of NAS
traffic with a particular encryption algorithm. This key is derived by UE and
MME from K~ASME,~ as well as an identifier for the encryption algorithm.
**\- K~eNB~** is a key derived by UE and MME from K~ASME~. K~eNB~ may also be
derived by the target eNB from NH at handover. K~eNB~ shall be used for the
derivation of K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~, and for the derivation of
K~eNB***** ~ upon handover.
\- **K~eNB*~** is a key derived by UE and source eNB from either K~eNB~ or
from a fresh NH. K~eNB*~ shall be used by UE and target eNB as a new K~eNB~
for RRC and UP traffic.
**\- K~UPenc~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of UP
traffic with a particular encryption algorithm. This key is derived by UE and
eNB from K~eNB~, as well as an identifier for the encryption algorithm.
**\- K~RRCint\ ~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of
RRC traffic with a particular integrity algorithm. **K~RRCint~** is derived by
UE and eNB from K~eNB~, as well as an identifier for the integrity algorithm.
> **\- K~RRCenc\ ~** is a key, which shall only be used for the protection of
> RRC traffic with a particular encryption algorithm. K~RRCenc~ is derived by
> UE and eNB from K~eNB~ as well as an identifier for the encryption
> algorithm.
\- Next Hop (**NH**) is used by UE and eNB in the derivation of K~eNB*~ for
the provision of \"forward security\" [22]. NH is derived by UE and MME from
K~ASME~ and K~eNB~ when the security context is established, or from K~ASME~
and previous NH, otherwise.
\- Next Hop Chaining Count (**NCC**) is a counter related to NH (i.e. the
amount of Key chaining that has been performed) which allow the UE to be
synchronised with the eNB and to determine whether the next **K~eNB*~** needs
to be based on the current K~eNB~ or a fresh NH.
Figure 14.1-1: Key Derivation
The MME invokes the AKA procedures by requesting authentication vectors to the
HE (Home environment) if no unused EPS authentication vectors have been
stored. The HE sends an authentication response back to the MME that contains
a fresh authentication vector, including a base-key named K~ASME~. Thus, as a
result of an AKA run, the EPC and the UE share K~ASME~. From K~ASME~, the NAS
keys, (and indirectly) K~eNB~ keys and NH are derived. The K~ASME~ is never
transported to an entity outside of the EPC, but K~eNB~ and NH are transported
to the eNB from the EPC when the UE transitions to ECM-CONNECTED. From the
K~eNB~, the eNB and UE can derive the UP and RRC keys.
RRC and UP keys are refreshed at handover. K~eNB*~ is derived by UE and source
eNB from target PCI, target frequency and K~eNB~ (this is referred to as a
_horizontal_ key derivation and is indicated to UE with an NCC that does not
increase) or from target PCI, target frequency and NH (this is referred to as
a _vertical_ key derivation and is indicated to UE with an NCC increase).
K~eNB*~ is then used as new K~eNB~ for RRC and UP traffic at the target. When
the UE goes into ECM-IDLE all keys are deleted from the eNB.
COUNT reusing avoidance for the same radio bearer identity in RRC_CONNECTED
mode without K~eNB~ change is left to eNB implementation e.g. by using intra-
cell handover, smart management of radio bearer identities or triggering a
transition to RRC_IDLE.
In case of HFN de-synchronisation in RRC_CONNECTED mode between the UE and
eNB, the UE is pushed to IDLE.
## 14.2 Security termination points
The table below describes the security termination points.

## 14.3 State Transitions and Mobility
### 14.3.1 RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTED
As a general principle, on RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTED transitions, RRC
protection keys and UP protection keys shall be generated while keys for NAS
protection as well as higher layer keys are assumed to be already available in
the MME. These higher layer keys may have been established in the MME as a
result of an AKA run, or as a result of a transfer from another MME during
handover or idle mode mobility [22].
### 14.3.2 RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE
On RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE transitions, eNBs shall delete the keys they
store such that state for idle mode UEs only has to be maintained in MME. It
is also assumed that eNB does no longer store state information about the
corresponding UE and deletes the current keys from its memory. In particular,
on connected to idle transitions:
\- The eNB and UE deletes NH, K~eNB~ , K~RRCenc~ , K~RRCint~ and K~UPenc~ and
related NCC.
\- MME and UE keeps K~ASME~, K~NASint~ and K~NASenc~ stored.
### 14.3.3 Intra E-UTRAN Mobility
The key hierarchy does not allow, as is, explicit RRC and UP key updates, but
RRC and UP keys are derived based on the algorithm identifiers and K~eNB~
which results with new RRC and UP keys at every handover:
\- Source eNB and UE independently create K~eNB*~ with the input parameters as
described in 3GPP TS 33.401 [22];
\- K~eNB*~ is given to Target eNB during the HO preparation phase;
\- Both Target eNB and UE considers the new K~eNB~ equal to the received
K~eNB*~.
The handling of HFN and PDCP SN at handover depends on the type of radio
bearer:
> \- SRB: HFN and PDCP SN are reset.
>
> \- RLC-UM bearers: HFN and PDCP SN are reset.
>
> \- RLC-AM bearers: PDCP SN and HFN are maintained (10.1.2.3).
>
> NOTE: COUNT reusing avoidance is left to network implementation.
## 14.4 AS Key Change in RRC_CONNECTED
If AS Keys (K~UPenc\ ,~ K~RRCint~ and K~RRCenc~) need to be changed in
RRC_CONNECTED, an intra-cell handover shall be used.
## 14.5 Security Interworking
Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN is only supported after activation of
integrity protection in UTRAN. Security may be activated in the target RAN
using null ciphering algorithms. If ciphering was not running in UTRAN, it
will be activated at handover to E-UTRAN. Integrity protection shall be
activated in E-UTRAN on handover from UTRAN/GERAN.
For E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN mobility, the MME shall derive and transfer to the
SGSN a confidentially key and an integrity key derived from K~ASME~ and other
input parameters as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [22]. Based on this
information, the SGSN can in turn derive appropriate keys to be used in the
target RAN.
Similarly for UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN mobility, the SGSN shall derive and
transfer to the MME a confidentially key and an integrity key CK and IK. Based
on this information and other input paramaters as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401
[22], the MME and UE can in turn derive K~ASME~.
# 15 Void
# 16 Radio Resource Management aspects
The purpose of radio resource management (RRM) is to ensure the efficient use
the available radio resources and to provide mechanisms that enable E-UTRAN to
meet radio resource related requirements identified in sub-clause 10 of 3GPP
TR 25.913 [2]. In particular, RRM in E-UTRAN provides means to manage (e.g.
assign, re-assign and release) radio resources taking into account single and
multi-cell aspects.
## 16.1 RRM functions
### 16.1.1 Radio Bearer Control (RBC)
The establishment, maintenance and release of Radio Bearers involve the
configuration of radio resources associated with them. When setting up a radio
bearer for a service, radio bearer control (RBC) takes into account the
overall resource situation in E-UTRAN, the QoS requirements of in-progress
sessions and the QoS requirement for the new service. RBC is also concerned
with the maintenance of radio bearers of in-progress sessions at the change of
the radio resource situation due to mobility or other reasons. RBC is involved
in the release of radio resources associated with radio bearers at session
termination, handover or at other occasions.
RBC is located in the eNB.
### 16.1.2 Radio Admission Control (RAC)
The task of radio admission control (RAC) is to admit or reject the
establishment requests for new radio bearers. In order to do this, RAC takes
into account the overall resource situation in E-UTRAN, the QoS requirements,
the priority levels and the provided QoS of in-progress sessions and the QoS
requirement of the new radio bearer request. The goal of RAC is to ensure high
radio resource utilization (by accepting radio bearer requests as long as
radio resources available) and at the same time to ensure proper QoS for in-
progress sessions (by rejecting radio bearer requests when they cannot be
accommodated).
RAC is located in the eNB.
### 16.1.3 Connection Mobility Control (CMC)
Connection mobility control (CMC) is concerned with the management of radio
resources in connection with idle or connected mode mobility. In idle mode,
the cell reselection algorithms are controlled by setting of parameters
(thresholds and hysteresis values) that define the best cell and/or determine
when the UE should select a new cell. Also, E-UTRAN broadcasts parameters that
configure the UE measurement and reporting procedures. In connected mode, the
mobility of radio connections has to be supported. Handover decisions may be
based on UE and eNB measurements. In addition, handover decisions may take
other inputs, such as neighbour cell load, traffic distribution, transport and
hardware resources and Operator defined policies into account.
CMC is located in the eNB.
### 16.1.4 Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) - Packet Scheduling (PS)
The task of dynamic resource allocation (DRA) or packet scheduling (PS) is to
allocate and de-allocate resources (including buffer and processing resources
and resource blocks (i.e. chunks)) to user and control plane packets. DRA
involves several sub-tasks, including the selection of radio bearers whose
packets are to be scheduled and managing the necessary resources (e.g. the
power levels or the specific resource blocks used). PS typically takes into
account the QoS requirements associated with the radio bearers, the channel
quality information for UEs, buffer status, interference situation, etc. DRA
may also take into account restrictions or preferences on some of the
available resource blocks or resource block sets due to inter-cell
interference coordination considerations.
DRA is located in the eNB.
### 16.1.5 Inter-cell Interference Coordination (ICIC)
Inter-cell interference coordination has the task to manage radio resources
(notably the radio resource blocks) such that inter-cell interference is kept
under control. ICIC is inherently a multi-cell RRM function that needs to take
into account information (e.g. the resource usage status and traffic load
situation) from multiple cells. The preferred ICIC method may be different in
the uplink and downlink.
ICIC is located in the eNB.
### 16.1.6 Load Balancing (LB)
Load balancing has the task to handle uneven distribution of the traffic load
over multiple cells. The purpose of LB is thus to influence the load
distribution in such a manner that radio resources remain highly utilized and
the QoS of in-progress sessions are maintained to the extent possible and call
dropping probabilities are kept sufficiently small. LB algorithms may result
in hand-over or cell reselection decisions with the purpose of redistribute
traffic from highly loaded cells to underutilized cells.
LB is located in the eNB.
### 16.1.7 Inter-RAT Radio Resource Management
Inter-RAT RRM is primarily concerned with the management of radio resources in
connection with inter-RAT mobility, notably inter-RAT handover. At inter-RAT
handover, the handover decision may take into account the involved RATs
resource situation as well as UE capabilities and Operator policies. The
importance of Inter-RAT RRM may depend on the specific scenario in which
E-UTRAN is deployed. Inter-RAT RRM may also include functionality for inter-
RAT load balancing for idle and connected mode UEs.
### 16.1.8 Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency Priority
The RRM strategy in E-UTRAN may be based on user specific information.
The Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency Priority (SPID) parameter received
by the eNB via the S1 interface is an index referring to user information
(e.g. mobility profile, service usage profile). The information is UE specific
and applies to all its Radio Bearers.
This index is mapped by the eNB to locally defined configuration in order to
apply specific RRM strategies (e.g. to define RRC_IDLE mode priorities and
control inter-RAT/inter frequency handover in RRC_CONNECTED mode).
## 16.2 RRM architecture
### 16.2.1 Centralised Handling of certain RRM Functions
### 16.2.2 De-Centralised RRM
#### 16.2.2.1 UE History Information
The source eNB collects and stores the UE History Information for as long as
the UE stays in one of its cells.
When information needs to be discarded because the list is full, such
information will be discarded in order of its position in the list, starting
with the oldest cell record.
The resulting information is then used in subsequent handover preparations by
means of the Handover Preparation procedures over the S1 and X2 interfaces,
which provide the target eNB with a list of previously visited cells and
associated (per-cell) information elements. The Handover Preparation
procedures also trigger the target eNB to start collection and storage of UE
history Information and thus to propagate the collected information.
### 16.2.3 Load balancing control
# 17 RF aspects
## 17.1 Spectrum deployments
# 18 UE capabilities
RRC signalling carries AS capabilities and NAS signalling carries NAS
capabilities. The UE capability information is stored in the MME. In the
uplink, no capability information is sent early in e.g. RRCConnectionRequest
message. In the downlink, enquiry procedure of the UE capability is supported.
Figure 18-1: Initial UE Capability Handling
_The MME stores the UE Radio Capability uploaded in the UE CAPABILITY INFO
INDICATION message._
The possible RAT-Types in Rel-8 are: EUTRAN, UTRAN, GERAN-PS, GERAN-CS,
CDMA2000-1XRTT. The GERAN capability is divided into separate parts. MS
Classmark 2 and Classmark 3 are used for CS domain (in both AS and NAS) and MS
Radio Access Capability is used for PS domain. The main part of CDMA2000
capabilities is not handled by the eNB or the MME, but is exchanged via
tunnelling (see 10.3.2). The small part of CDMA2000 capabilities (for
CDMA2000-1XRTT) is needed for the eNB to be able to build messages for the
target CDMA2000 RNC (see 10.3.2).
The eNB may acquire the UE capabilities after a Handover completion. The UE
capabilities are then uploaded to the MME.
Usually during handover preparation, the source RAN node transfers both the UE
source RAT capabilities and the target RAT capabilities to the target RAN
node, in order to minimize interruptions and to follow the principles in
subclause 10.2.2. This is described in subclause 19.2.2.5.6. However at
Handover from UTRAN to EUTRAN, it is optional to forward the UTRAN
capabilities to the target RAN. The source RAN is not mandated to acquire
other RAT capabilities (i.e. other than the source and target RAT
capabilities) in order to start a handover preparation.
The UTRAN capabilities, i.e. the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO, include START-CS,
START-PS and \"predefined configurations\", which are \"dynamic\" IEs. In
order to avoid the START values desynchronisation and the key replaying issue,
the eNB always enquiry the UE UTRAN capabilities at transition from RRC_IDLE
to RRC_CONNECTED and before Handover to UTRAN. The eNB does not upload the UE
UTRAN capabilities to the MME.
# 19 S1 Interface
## 19.1 S1 User plane
The S1 user plane interface (S1-U) is defined between the eNB and the S-GW.
The S1-U interface provides non guaranteed delivery of user plane PDUs between
the eNB and the S-GW. The user plane protocol stack on the S1 interface is
shown in Figure 19.1-1. The transport network layer is built on IP transport
and GTP-U is used on top of UDP/IP to carry the user plane PDUs between the
eNB and the S-GW.
Figure 19.1-1: S1 Interface User Plane (eNB - S-GW)
## 19.2 S1 Control Plane
The S1 control plane interface (S1-MME) is defined between the eNB and the
MME. The control plane protocol stack of the S1 interface is shown on Figure
19.2-1. The transport network layer is built on IP transport, similarly to the
user plane but for the reliable transport of signalling messages SCTP is added
on top of IP. The application layer signalling protocol is referred to as
S1-AP (S1 Application Protocol).
Figure 19.2-1: S1 Interface Control Plane (eNB-MME)
The SCTP layer provides the guaranteed delivery of application layer messages.
In the transport IP layer point-to-point transmission is used to deliver the
signalling PDUs.
A single SCTP association per S1-MME interface instance shall be used with one
pair of stream identifiers for S1-MME common procedures. Only a few pairs of
stream identifiers should be used for S1-MME dedicated procedures. MME
communication context identifiers that are assigned by the MME for S1-MME
dedicated procedures and eNB communication context identifiers that are
assigned by the eNB for S1-MME dedicated procedures shall be used to
distinguish UE specific S1-MME signalling transport bearers. The communication
context identifiers are conveyed in the respective S1-AP messages.
### 19.2.1 S1 Interface Functions
Note: The following list of S1 functions reflects the status of agreements in
RAN3, might be extended in forthcoming meetings.
\- E-RAB Service Management function:
\- Setup, Modify, Release.
\- Mobility Functions for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED:
\- Intra-LTE Handover;
\- Inter-3GPP-RAT Handover.
\- S1 Paging function:
\- NAS Signalling Transport function;
\- S1-interface management functions:
\- Error indication;
\- Reset.
\- Network Sharing Function;
\- Roaming and Area Restriction Support function;
\- NAS Node Selection Function;
\- Initial Context Setup Function;
\- UE Context Modification Function;
\- MME Load balancing Function;
\- Location Reporting Function;
\- ETWS Message Transmission Function;
\- Overload function;
\- RAN Information Management Function;
\- Configuration Transfer Function.
\- S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling function.
#### 19.2.1.1 S1 Paging function
The paging function supports the sending of paging requests to all cells of
the TA(s) the UE is registered.
Paging requests are sent to the relevant eNBs according to the mobility
information kept in the UE's MM context in the serving MME.
#### 19.2.1.2 S1 UE Context Management function
In order to support UEs in ECM-CONNECTED, UE contexts need to be managed, i.e.
established and released in the eNodeB and in the EPC to support user
individual signalling on S1.
#### 19.2.1.3 Initial Context Setup Function
The Initial Context Setup function supports the establishment of the necessary
overall initial UE Context including E-RAB context, Security context, roaming
restriction, UE capability information, Subscriber Profile ID for
RAT/Frequency Priority, UE S1 signalling connection ID, etc. in the eNB to
enable fast Idle-to-Active transition.
In addition to the setup of overall initial UE Contexts, Initial Context Setup
function also supports the piggy-backing of the corresponding NAS messages.
Initial Context Setup is initiated by the MME.
#### 19.2.1.3a UE Context Modification Function
The UE Context Modification function supports the modification of UE Context
in eNB for UEs in active state.
#### 19.2.1.4 Mobility Functions for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED
##### 19.2.1.4.1 Intra-LTE Handover
The Intra-LTE-Handover function supports mobility for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED and
comprises the preparation, execution and completion of handover via the X2 and
S1 interfaces.
##### 19.2.1.4.2 Inter-3GPP-RAT Handover
The Inter-3GPP-RAT Handover function supports mobility to and from other 3GPP-
RATs for UEs in ECM-CONNECTED and comprises the preparation, execution and
completion of handover via the S1 interface.
#### 19.2.1.5 E-RAB Service Management function
The E-RAB Service management function is responsible for establishing,
modifying and releasing E-UTRAN resources for user data transport once a UE
context is available in the eNB. The establishment and modification of E-UTRAN
resources is triggered by the MME and requires respective QoS information to
be provided to the eNB. The release of E-UTRAN resources is triggered by the
MME either directly or following a request received from the eNB (optional).
#### 19.2.1.6 NAS Signalling Transport function
The NAS Signalling Transport function provides means to transport a NAS
message (e.g. for NAS mobility management) for a specific UE on the S1
interface.
#### 19.2.1.7 NAS Node Selection Function (NNSF)
The interconnection of eNBs to multiple MME/Serving S-GWs is supported in the
E-UTRAN/EPC architecture. Therefore a NAS node selection function is located
in the eNB to determine the MME association of the UE, based on the UE's
temporary identifier, which was assigned to the UE by the CN node (e.g. MME or
SGSN).
NOTE: In case the UE's temporary identifier is assigned by the SGSN,
respective mapping rules are defined in [26].
Depending on the actual scenario the NNSF determines the UE's MME association
either based its S-TMSI (e.g. at service request) or based on its GUMMEI and
selected PLMN (e.g. at attach or tracking area update in non-registered TA).
This functionality is located in the eNB only and enables proper routing via
the S1 interface. On S1, no specific procedure corresponds to the NAS Node
Selection Function.
#### 19.2.1.8 S1-interface management functions
The S1-interface management functions provide
\- means to ensure a defined start of S1-interface operation (reset)
\- means to handle different versions of application part implementations and
protocol errors (error indication)
#### 19.2.1.9 MME Load balancing Function
MME Load balancing is the function which achieves load-balanced MMEs with
respect to their processing capacity within a pool area during system
operation. The means to load-balance MMEs is to distribute UEs newly entering
the pool to different MMEs in the MME pool. In addition the MME load balancing
function is able to achieve equally loaded MMEs within a pool area after the
introduction of a new MME and after the removal of a MME from the network.
The support of the MME load balancing function is achieved by indicating the
relative MME capacity in the S1 Setup procedure to all eNBs served by the MMEs
of the pool area per MME. In order to support the introduction and/or removal
of MMEs the MME initiated S1 setup update procedure may be used by the
operator indicating relative MME capacity value changes. The indicated
relative MME capacity steers the UE assignment for UEs newly entering the MME
pool.
#### 19.2.1.10 Location Reporting Function
The Location Reporting function supports the MME requests to the eNB to report
the location information of the UE.
#### 19.2.1.11 Warning Message Transmission function
The warning message transmission function provides means to transfer warning
message via S1 interface.
#### 19.2.1.12 Overload Function
The overload function comprises the signalling means:
\- to indicate to a proportion of eNBs that the serving MME is overloaded
\- to indicate to the eNBs that the serving MME is back in the \"normal
operation mode\"
#### 19.2.1.13 RAN Information Management Function
The RAN Information Management (RIM) function is a generic mechanism that

#### 19.2.2.1 Paging procedure
Figure 19.2.2.1-1: Paging procedure
The MME initiates the paging procedure by sending the PAGING message to each
eNB with cells belonging to the tracking area(s) in which the UE is
registered. Each eNB can contain cells belonging to different tracking areas,
whereas each cell can only belong to one TA.
The paging response back to the MME is initiated on NAS layer and is sent by
the eNB based on NAS-level routing information.
#### 19.2.2.2 S1 UE Context Release procedure
The S1 UE Context Release procedure causes the eNB to remove all UE individual
signalling resources and the related user data transport resources. This
procedure is initiated by the EPC and may be triggered on request of the
serving eNB.
##### 19.2.2.2.1 S1 UE Context Release (EPC triggered)
Figure 19.2.2.2.1-1: S1 UE Context Release procedure (EPC triggered)
\- The EPC initiates the UE Context Release procedure by sending the S1 UE
Context Release Command towards the E-UTRAN. The eNodeB releases all related
signalling and user data transport resources.
\- The eNB confirms the S1 UE Context Release activity with the S1 UE Context
Release Complete message.
\- In the course of this procedure the EPC releases all related resources as
well, except context resources in the EPC for mobility management and the
default EPS Bearer/E-RAB configuration.
##### 19.2.2.2.2 S1 UE Context Release Request (eNB triggered)
The S1 UE Context Release Request procedure is initiated for E-UTRAN internal
reasons and comprises the following steps:
\- The eNB sends the S1 UE Context Release Request message to the EPC.
\- The EPC triggers the EPC initiated UE context release procedure.
Figure 19.2.2.2.2-1: S1 UE Context Release Request procedure (eNB triggered)\
and subsequent S1 UE Context Release procedure (EPC triggered)
If the E-UTRAN internal reason is a radio link failure detected in the eNB,
the eNB shall wait a sufficient time before triggering the S1 UE Context
Release Request procedure in order to allow the UE to perform the NAS recovery
procedure [17].
#### 19.2.2.3 Initial Context Setup procedure
The Initial Context Setup procedure establishes the necessary overall initial
UE context in the eNB in case of an Idle-to Active transition. The Initial
Context Setup procedure is initiated by the MME.
The Initial Context Setup procedure comprises the following steps:
\- The MME initiates the Initial Context Setup procedure by sending INITIAL
CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST to the eNB. This message may include general UE Context
(e.g. security context, roaming restrictions, UE capability information, UE S1
signalling connection ID, etc.), E-RAB context (Serving GW TEID, QoS
information), and may be piggy-backed with the corresponding NAS messages.
When there are multiple NAS messages in the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST
message, the MME shall ensure that the NAS messages in the E-RAB to be Setup
List are aligned in the order of reception from the NAS layer to ensure the
in-sequence delivery of the NAS messages.
\- Upon receipt of INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST, the eNB setup the context of
the associated UE, and perform the necessary RRC signalling towards the UE,
e.g. Radio Bearer Setup procedure. When there are multiple NAS messages to be
sent in the RRC message, the order of the NAS messages in the RRC message
shall be kept the same as that in the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message.
\- The eNB responds with INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP COMPLETE to inform a successful
operation, and with INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP FAILURE to inform an unsuccessful
operation.
NOTE: In case of failure, eNB and MME behaviours are not mandated. Both
implicit release (local release at each node) and explicit release (MME-
initiated UE Context Release procedure) may in principle be adopted. The eNB
should ensure that no hanging resources remain at the eNB.
Figure 19.2.2.3-1: Initial Context Setup procedure (highlighted in blue) in
Idle-to-Active procedure
#### 19.2.2.3a UE Context Modification procedure
The UE Context Modification procedure enables the MME to modify the UE context
in the eNB for UEs in active state. The UE Context Modification procedure is
initiated by the MME.
The UE Context Modification procedure comprises the following steps:
\- The MME initiates the UE Context Modification procedure by sending UE
CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST to the eNB to modify the UE context in the eNB
for UEs in active state.
\- The eNB responds with UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE to inform a
successful operation, and with UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION FAILURE to inform an
unsuccessful operation.
Figure 19.2.2.3a-1: UE Context Modification procedure
#### 19.2.2.4 E-RAB signalling procedures
##### 19.2.2.4.1 E-RAB Setup procedure
Figure 19.2.2.4.1-1: E-RAB Setup procedure
The E-RAB Setup procedure is initiated by the MME to support:
\- Assignment of resources to a dedicated E-RAB.
\- Assignment of resources for a default E-RAB.
\- Setup of S1 Bearer (on S1) and Data Radio Bearer (on Uu).
The E-RAB Setup procedure comprises the following steps:
\- The E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message is sent by the MME to the eNB to setup
resources on S1 and Uu for one or several E-RAB(s). The E-RAB SETUP REQUEST
message contains the Serving GW TEID, QoS indicator(s) and the corresponding
NAS message per E-RAB within the E-RAB To Be Setup List. When there are
multiple NAS messages in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message, the MME shall ensure
that the NAS messages in the E-RAB to be Setup List are aligned in the order
of reception from the NAS layer to ensure the in-sequence delivery of the NAS
messages.
\- Upon receipt of the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message the eNB establishes the
Data Radio Bearer(s) (RRC: Radio Bearer Setup) and resources for S1 Bearers.
When there are multiple NAS messages to be sent in the RRC message, the order
of the NAS messages in the RRC message shall be kept the same as that in the
E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message.
\- The eNB responds with a E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE messages to inform whether the
setup of resources and establishment of each E-RAB was successful or
unsuccessful, with the E-RAB Setup list (E-RAB ID , eNB TEID) and the E-RAB
Failed to Setup list (E-RAB ID, Cause) The eNB also creates the binding
between the S1 bearer(s) (DL/UL TEID) and the Data Radio Bearer(s).
**Interactions with UE Context Release Request procedure:**
In case of no response from the UE the eNB shall trigger the S1 UE Context
Release Request procedure.
##### 19.2.2.4.2 E-RAB Modification procedure
Figure 19.2.2.4.2-1: E-RAB Modification procedure
The E-RAB Modification procedure is initiated by the MME to support the
modification of already established E-RAB configurations:
  * Modify of S1 Bearer (on S1) and Radio Bearer (on Uu)
The EPS Bearer Modification procedure comprises the following steps:
\- The E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message is sent by the MME to the eNB to modify
one or several E-RAB(s). The E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message contains the QoS
indicator(s), and the corresponding NAS message per E-RAB in the E-RAB To Be
Modified List. When there are multiple NAS messages in the E-RAB MODIFY
REQUEST message, the MME shall ensure that the NAS messages in the E-RAB to be
Modified List are aligned in the order of reception from the NAS layer to
ensure the in-sequence delivery of the NAS messages.
\- Upon receipt of the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message the eNB modifies the Data
Radio Bearer configuration (RRC procedure to modify the Data Radio bearer).
When there are multiple NAS messages to be sent in the RRC message, the order
of the NAS messages in the RRC message shall be kept the same as that in the
E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message.
\- The eNB responds with an E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message to inform whether
the E-RAB modification has succeeded or not indicating with the E-RAB Modify
list and E-RAB Failed to Modify list. With E-RAB ID(s) in the E-RAB Modify
List or E-RAB Failed to Modify List the eNB identifies the E-RAB(s)
successfully modified or failed to modify.
**Interactions with UE Context Release Request procedure:**
In case of no response from the UE the eNB shall trigger the S1 UE Context
Release Request procedure.
##### 19.2.2.4.3 E-RAB Release procedure
Figure 19.2.2.4.3-1: E-RAB Release procedure
The E-RAB Release procedure is initiated by the MME to release resources for
the indicated E-RABs.
The E-RAB Release procedure comprises the following steps:
\- The E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message is sent by the MME to the eNB to release
resources on S1 and Uu for one or several E-RAB(s). With the E-RAB ID(s) in
the E-RAB To Be Released List contained in E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message the
MME identifies, the E-RAB(s) to be released.
\- Upon receipt of the E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message the eNB releases the Data
Radio Bearers (RRC: Radio bearer release) and S1 Bearers.
\- The eNB responds with an E-RAB RELEASE COMPLETE message containing E-RAB
Release list and E-RAB Failed to Release list. With the E-RAB IDs in the E-RAB
Release List/E-RAB Failed to Release List the eNB identifies the E-RAB(s)
successfully released or failed to release.
**Interactions with UE Context Release Request procedure:**
In case of no response or negative response from the UE or in case the eNB
cannot successfully perform the release of any of the requested bearers, the
eNB shall trigger the S1 UE Context Release Request procedure, except if the
eNB has already initiated the procedures associated with X2 Handover.
##### 19.2.2.4.4 E-RAB Release Indication procedure
Figure 19.2.2.4.4-1: E-RAB Release Indication procedure
The E-RAB Release Indication procedure enables the E-UTRAN to send information
about released resources for one or several E-RABs to the MME. The eNB
initiates the procedure by sending the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message to the
MME. The E-RAB ID(s) in the E-RAB Released List identifies the released
E-RAB(s) in the eNB.
#### 19.2.2.5 Handover signalling procedures
Handover signalling procedures support both, inter-eNB handover and inter-RAT
handover.
Inter-RAT handovers shall be initiated via the S1 interface.
Inter-eNB handovers shall be initiated via the X2 interface except if any of
the following conditions are true:
\- there is no X2 between source and target eNB.
\- the source eNB has been configured to initiate handover to the particular
target eNB via S1 interface in order to enable the change of an EPC node (MME
and/or Serving GW).
\- the source eNB has attempted to start the inter-eNB HO via X2 but receives
a negative reply from the target eNB with a specific cause value.
Inter-eNB handovers shall be initiated via the S1 interface, if one of the
above conditions applies.
##### 19.2.2.5.1 Handover Preparation procedure
The Handover preparation procedure is initiated by the source eNB if it
determines the necessity to initiate the handover via the S1 interface.
Figure 19.2.2.5.1-1: Handover preparation procedure
The handover preparation comprises the following steps:
\- The HANDOVER REQUIRED message is sent to the MME.
\- The handover preparation phase is finished upon the reception of the
HANDOVER COMMAND message in the source eNB, which includes at least radio
interface related information (HO Command for the UE), successfully
established E-RAB(s) and E-RAB(s) which failed to setup.
  * In case the handover resource allocation is not successful (e.g. no resources are available on the target side) the MME responds with the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message instead of the HANDOVER COMMAND message.
##### 19.2.2.5.2 Handover Resource Allocation procedure
The handover resource allocation comprises the following steps:
EMBED Word.Picture.8 {width="6.072222222222222in"
height="2.2597222222222224in"}
Figure 19.2.2.5.2-1: Handover resource allocation procedure
\- The MME sends the HANDOVER REQUEST message including the E-RAB(s) which
needs to be setup by the target eNB.
\- The target eNB responds with the HANDOVER REQUEST ACK message after the
required resources for all accepted E-RABs are allocated. The HANDOVER REQUEST
ACK message contains successfully established E-RAB(s), E-RAB(s) which failed
to setup and radio interface related information (HO Command for the UE),
which is later sent transparently via the EPC/CN from the target RAT to the
source RAT.
If no resources are available on the target side, the target eNB responds with
the HANDOVER FAILURE message instead of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACK message.
##### 19.2.2.5.3 Handover Notification procedure
The Handover Completion for S1 initiated handovers comprises the following
steps:
\- The HANDOVER NOTIFY message is sent by the target eNB to the MME when the
UE has successfully been transferred to the target cell.

the HANDOVER CANCEL ACK message.
##### 19.2.2.5.5 Path Switch procedure
The handover completion phase for X2 initiated handovers comprises the
following steps:
\- The PATH SWITCH message is sent by the target eNB to the MME when the UE
has successfully been transferred to the target cell. The PATH SWITCH message
includes the outcome of the resource allocation: successfully established
E-RAB(s).
  * The MME responds with the PATH SWITCH ACK message which is sent to the eNB.
  * The MME responds with the PATH SWITCH FAILURE message in case a failure occurs in the EPC.

##### 19.2.2.5.6 Message sequence diagrams
This subclause complements TR 25.922 [27] subclause 5.1.7.2 regarding the
E-UTRAN handling of containers.
Most RRC information is carried by means of containers across interfaces other
than Uu. The following sequence diagrams illustrate which RRC information
should be included within these containers used across the different network
interfaces.
NOTE: In order to maintain independence between protocols, no requirements are
included in the interface protocols that are used to transfer the RRC
information.
In Rel-8 SRVCC (see TS 23.216 [28]) is supported from EUTRAN to UTRAN or GERAN
A/Gb mode, but not in the other direction.
There is no support for interworking between EUTRAN and GERAN Iu-mode and
between EUTRAN and GAN.
Figure 19.2.2.5.6-1 illustrates the message sequence for the PS handover from
GERAN to EUTRAN procedure:

REPORT to the MME to report the current location information of a specific UE
as a standalone report, or every time UE changes cell.
##### 19.2.2.11.3 Location Report Failure Indication procedure
Figure 19.2.2.11.3-1: Location Report Failure Indication procedure
The Location Report Failure Indication procedure is initiated by the eNB by
sending the LOCATION REPORT FAILURE INDICATION to the MME to indicate that the
Location Report Control procedure has failed due to e.g. UE has performed
inter-eNB handover.
#### 19.2.2.12 Overload procedure
##### 19.2.2.12.1 Overload Start procedure
The Overload Start procedure is used by the MME to indicate to a proportion of
eNBs to which the MME has an S1 interface connection that the MME is
overloaded. The Overload Start procedure is used to provide an indication
which signalling traffic needs to be rejected/permitted only.
Figure 19.2.2.12.1-1 Overload Start procedure
If the Overload Start message is received whereas there is already an ongoing
overload action, the eNB shall replace the ongoing overload action with the
newly requested one.
##### 19.2.2.12.2 Overload Stop procedure
The Overload Stop procedure is used by the MME to indicate the concerned
eNB(s) that the MME is no longer overloaded.
Figure 19.2.2.12.2-1: Overload Stop procedure
#### 19.2.2.13 Write-Replace Warning procedure
Figure 19.2.2.13.1-1: Write-Replace Warning procedure
The Write-Replace Warning procedure is used to start the broadcasting and to
overwrite the ongoing broadcasting of a warning message.
ETWS is an example of warning system using this procedure.
This procedure is initiated by the MME by sending WRITE-REPLACE WARNING
REQUEST message containing at least the Message Identifier, Emergency Area
list, information on how the broadcast should be performed, and the contents
of the warning message to be broadcast.
The eNB responds with WRITE-REPLACE WARNING RESPONSE message to acknowledge
that the requested ETWS message broadcast was initiated.
#### 19.2.2.14 eNB Direct Information Transfer procedure
The eNB Direct Information Transfer procedure is initiated by the eNB to
request and transfer information to the core network.
Figure 19.2.2.14-1: eNB Direct Information Transfer procedure
\- The eNB Direct Information Transfer procedure is initiated by the eNB by
sending the eNB DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message to the MME. The eNB DIRECT
INFORMATION TRANSFER message contains RIM information and RIM routing address
which identifies the final RAN destination node.
#### 19.2.2.15 MME Direct Information Transfer procedure
The MME Direct Information Transfer procedure is initiated by the MME to
request and transfer information to the core network.
Figure 19.2.2.15-1: MME Direct Information Transfer procedure
\- The MME Direct Information Transfer procedure is initiated by the MME by
sending the MME DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message to the eNB. The MME DIRECT
INFORMATION TRANSFER message contains RIM information.
#### 19.2.2.16 S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling procedures
The S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling procedures carry CDMA2000 signalling messages
between UE and CDMA2000 RAT over the S1 Interface. This includes signalling
for pre-registration and handover preparation for optimized mobility from
E-UTRAN to CDMA2000 HRPD, signalling for handover preparation for mobility
from E-UTRAN to CDMA2000 1xRTT and signalling to support CS fallback to
CDMA2000 1xRTT for mobile originated and mobile terminated CS domain services.
The CDMA2000 messages are tunnelled transparently to the eNB and MME, however,
additional information may be sent along with the tunnelled CDMA2000 message
to assist the eNodeB and MME in the Tunnelling procedure. The procedures
providing this functionality are:
\- Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling procedure;
\- Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling procedure.
##### 19.2.2.16.1 Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling procedure
The MME sends the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message to the eNB to
forward a CDMA2000 message towards an UE for which a logical S1 connection
exists (see Figure 19.2.2.16.1-1 below).
Figure 19.2.2.16.1-1: Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling procedure
##### 19.2.2.16.2 Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling procedure
The eNB sends the UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message to the MME to forward
a CDMA2000 message towards the CDMA2000 RAT (HRPD or 1xRTT) as depicted on
Figure 19.2.2.16.2-1 below.

# 20 X2 Interface
## 20.1 User Plane
The X2 user plane interface (X2-U) is defined between eNBs. The X2-U interface
provides non guaranteed delivery of user plane PDUs. The user plane protocol
stack on the X2 interface is shown in Figure 20.1-1. The transport network
layer is built on IP transport and GTP-U is used on top of UDP/IP to carry the
user plane PDUs.
The X2-UP interface protocol stack is identical to the S1-UP protocol stack.
Figure 20.1-1: X2 Interface User Plane (eNB-eNB)
## 20.2 Control Plane
The X2 control plane interface (X2-CP) is defined between two neighbour eNBs.
The control plane protocol stack of the X2 interface is shown on Figure 20.2-1
below. The transport network layer is built on SCTP on top of IP. The
application layer signalling protocol is referred to as X2-AP (X2 Application
Protocol).
Figure 20.2-1: X2 Interface Control Plane
A single SCTP association per X2-C interface instance shall be used with one
pair of stream identifiers for X2-C common procedures. Only a few pairs of
stream identifiers should be used for X2-C dedicated procedures.
Source-eNB communication context identifiers that are assigned by the source-
eNB for X2-C dedicated procedures, and target-eNB communication context
identifiers that are assigned by the target-eNB for X2-C dedicated procedures,
shall be used to distinguish UE specific X2-C signalling transport bearers.
The communication context identifiers are conveyed in the respective X2AP
messages.
### 20.2.1 X2-CP Functions
The X2AP protocol supports the following functions:
\- Intra LTE-Access-System Mobility Support for UE in ECM-CONNECTED:
\- Context transfer from source eNB to target eNB;
\- Control of user plane tunnels between source eNB and target eNB;
\- Handover cancellation.
> \- Load Management;
\- General X2 management and error handling functions:
\- Error indication;
\- Setting up the X2;
\- Resetting the X2;
\- Updating the X2 configuration data.
### 20.2.2 X2-CP Procedures

* * *
#### 20.2.2.1 Handover Preparation procedure
The Handover preparation procedure is initiated by the source eNB if it
determines the necessity to initiate the handover via the X2 interface.
Figure 20.2.2.1-1: Handover Preparation procedure
The source eNB sends a HANDOVER REQUEST to the target eNB including the
bearers to be setup by the target ENB.
The handover preparation phase is finished upon the reception of the HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message in the source eNB, which includes at least radio
interface related information (HO Command for the UE), successfully
established E-RAB(s) and failed established E-RAB(s).
In case the handover resource allocation is not successful (e.g. no resources
are available on the target side) the target eNB responds with the HANDOVER
PREPARATION FAILURE message instead of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message.
If eNB received NAS message from MME during X2 handover procedure, it shall be
acted as specified in subclause 19.2.2.6.
#### 20.2.2.2 Handover Cancel procedure
This functionality is located in the source eNB to allow cancellation of the
handover procedure.
Figure 20.2.2.2-1: Handover Cancel procedure
The source eNB sends a HANDOVER CANCEL message to the target eNB indicating
the reason for the handover cancellation.
#### 20.2.2.3 UE Context Release procedure
The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the target eNB to signal to
the source eNB that resources for the handed over UE context can be released.
Figure 20.2.2.3-1: UE Context Release procedure
By sending UE CONTEXT RELEASE the target eNB informs the source eNB of
Handover success and triggers the release of resources.
#### 20.2.2.4 SN Status Transfer procedure
The purpose of the SN Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the uplink PDCP
SN and HFN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN and HFN transmitter status
from the source to the target eNB during an X2 handover for each respective
E-RAB for which PDCP SN and HFN status preservation applies.
Figure 20.2.2.4-1: SN Status Transfer procedure
#### 20.2.2.5 Error Indication procedure
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by an eNB to signal to a peer eNB
an error situation in a received message, provided it cannot be reported by an
appropriate failure message.
Figure 20.2.2.5-1: Error Indication procedure
#### 20.2.2.6 Load Indication procedure
Inter-cell interference coordination in E-UTRAN is performed through the X2
interface. In case of variation in the interference conditions, the eNB
signals the new lcondition to its neighbour eNBs e.g. the neighbour eNBs for
which an X2 interface is configured due to mobility reasons.
The Load Indication procedure is used to transfer interference co-ordination
information between neighboring eNBs managing intra-frequency cells.
Figure 20.2.2.6-1: Load Indication procedure
#### 20.2.2.7 X2 Setup procedure
The purpose of the X2 Setup procedure is to exchange application level data
needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly over the X2 interface.
Figure 20.2.2.7-1: X2 Setup procedure
#### 20.2.2.8 eNB Configuration Update procedure
The purpose of the eNB Configuration Update procedure is to update application
level configuration data needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly over
the X2 interface.
Figure 20.2.2.8-1: eNB Configuration Update procedure
#### 20.2.2.9 Reset procedure
The Reset procedure is initiated by an eNB to align the resources with a peer
eNB in the event of an abnormal failure. The procedure resets the whole X2
interface.
Figure 20.2.2.9-1: Reset procedure
#### 20.2.2.10 Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure
The Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure is used by an eNB to
request load measurements from another eNB.
Figure 20.2.2.10-1: Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure
#### 20.2.2.11 Resource Status Reporting procedure
The Resource Status Reporting procedure reports measurement results requested
by another eNB.

# 21 System and Terminal complexity
## 21.1 Overall System complexity
## 21.2 Physical layer complexity
## 21.3 UE complexity
# 22 Support for self-configuration and self-optimisation
## 22.1 Definitions
This concept includes several different functions from eNB activation to radio
parameter tuning. Figure 22.1-1 is a basic framework for all self-
configuration /self-optimization functions.
**Self-configuration process** is defined as the process where newly deployed
nodes are configured by automatic installation procedures to get the necessary
basic configuration for system operation.
This process works in pre-operational state. Pre-operational state is
understood as the state from when the eNB is powered up and has backbone
connectivity until the RF transmitter is switched on.
As described in Figure 21.1, functions handled in the pre-operational state
like:
\- Basic Setup and
\- Initial Radio Configuration
are covered by the Self Configuration process.
NOTE: depending on the final chosen functional distribution in RAN, the
feasibility of following items should be studied e.g.:
\- To obtain the necessary interface configuration;
\- Automatic registration of nodes in the system can be provided by the
network;
\- Alternative possibilities for nodes to obtain a valid configuration;
\- The required standardization scope.
**Self-optimization process** is defined as the process where UE & eNB
measurements and performance measurements are used to auto-tune the network.
This process works in operational state. Operational state is understood as
the state where the RF interface is additionally switched on.
As described in Figure 21.1, functions handled in the operational state like:
\- Optimization / Adaptation
are covered by the Self Optimization process.
NOTE: depending on the final chosen functional distribution in RAN the
feasibility of following items should be studied e.g.:
\- The distribution of data and measurements over interfaces relevant to RAN3;
\- Functions/entities/nodes in charge of data aggregation for optimization
purpose;
\- Dependencies with O&M and O&M interfaces, in the self optimization process;
\- The required standardization scope.
Figure 22.1-1: Ramifications of Self-Configuration /Self-Optimization
functionality
## 22.2 UE Support for self-configuration and self-optimisation
UE shall support measurements and procedures which can be used for self-
configuration and self-optimisation of the E-UTRAN system.
\- UE shall support measurements and measurement reporting to support self-
optimisation of the E-UTRAN system. Measurements and reports used for the
normal system operation, should be used as input for the self-optimisation
process as far as possible.
> NOTE: the UE impact should be carefully investigated and taken into account.
\- The network is able to configure the measurements and the reporting for
self-optimisation support by RRC signalling messages.
## 22.3 Self-configuration
### 22.3.1 Dynamic configuration of the S1-MME interface
#### 22.3.1.1 Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are assumed:
  * An initial remote IP end point to be used for SCTP initialisation is provided to the eNB for each MME. The eNB may be in pre-operational or operational state when this occurs.
How the eNB gets the remote IP end point(s) and its own IP address are outside
the scope of this specification.
#### 22.3.1.2 SCTP initialization
\- For each MME the eNodeB tries to initialize a SCTP association as described
in [8], using a known initial remote IP Endpoint as the starting point, until
SCTP connectivity is established.
#### 22.3.1.3 Application layer initialization
Once SCTP connectivity has been established, the eNodeB and MME shall exchange
application level configuration data over the S1-MME application protocol with
the S1 Setup Procedure, which is needed for these two nodes to interwork
correctly on the S1 interface.
\- The eNodeB provides the relevant configuration information to the MME,
which includes list of supported TA(s), etc.
\- The MME provides the relevant configuration information to the eNodeB,
which includes PLMN ID, etc.
\- When the application layer initialization is successfully concluded,the
dynamic configuration procedure is completed and the S1-MME interface is
operational.
### 22.3.2 Dynamic Configuration of the X2 interface
#### 22.3.2.1 Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are assumed:
\- An initial remote IP end point to be used for SCTP initialisation is
provided to the eNB.
#### 22.3.2.2 SCTP initialization
For candidate eNB the eNB tries to initialize a SCTP association as described
in [8], using a known initial remote IP Endpoint as the starting point, until
SCTP connectivity is established.
#### 22.3.2.3 Application layer initialization
Once SCTP connectivity has been established, the eNB and its candidate peer
eNB are in a position to exchange application level configuration data over
the X2 application protocol needed for the two nodes to interwork correctly on
the X2 interface.
\- The eNB provides the relevant configuration information to the candidate
eNB, which includes served cell information, etc.
\- The candidate eNB provides the relevant configuration information to the
initiating eNB, which includes served cell information, etc.
\- When the application layer initialization is successfully concluded, the
dynamic configuration procedure is completed and the X2 interface is
operational.
### 22.3.2a Automatic Neighbour Relation Function
The purpose of the **Automatic Neighbour Relation** (ANR) function is to
relieve the operator from the burden of manually managing Neighbour Relations
(NRs). Figure 22.3.2a-1 shows ANR and its environment:
Figure 22.3.2a-1: Interaction between eNB and O&M due to ANR
The ANR function resides in the eNB and manages the conceptual Neighbour
Relation Table (NRT). Located within ANR, the Neighbour Detection Function
finds new neighbours and adds them to the NRT. ANR also contains the Neighbour
Removal Function which removes outdated NRs. The Neighbour Detection Function
and the Neighbour Removal Function are implementation specific.
A **Neighbour cell Relation** (NR) in the context of ANR is defined as
follows:
An existing Neighbour Relation from a source cell to a target cell means that
eNB controlling the source cell:
_a)_ Knows the ECGI/CGI and PCI of the target cell.
_b)_ Has an entry in the Neighbour Relation Table for the source cell
identifying the target cell.
_c)_ Has the attributes in this Neighbour Relation Table entry defined, either
by O&M or set to default values.
For each cell that the eNB has, the eNB keeps a NRT, see Figure 22.3.2a-1. For
each NR, the NRT contains the Target Cell Identifier (TCI), which identifies
the target cell. For E-UTRAN, the TCI corresponds to the E-UTAN Cell Global
Identifier (ECGI) and Physical Cell Identifier (PCI) of the target cell.
Furthermore, each NR has three attributes, the NoRemove, the NoHO and the NoX2
attribute. These attributes have the following definitions:
**\- No Remove** : If checked, the eNB shall not remove the Neighbour cell
Relation from the NRT.
**\- No HO** : If checked, the Neighbour cell Relation shall not be used by
the eNB for handover reasons.
**\- No X2:** If checked, the Neighbour Relation shall not use an X2 interface
in order to initiate procedures towards the eNB parenting the target cell.
Neighbour cell Relations are cell-to-cell relations, while an X2 link is set
up between two eNBs. Neighbour cell Relations are unidirectional, while an X2
link is bidirectional.
The ANR function also allows O&M to manage the NRT. O&M can add and delete
NRs. It can also change the attributes of the NRT. The O&M system is informed
about changes in the NRT.
### 22.3.3 Intra-LTE/frequency Automatic Neighbour Relation Function
The ANR (Automatic Neighbor Relation) function relies on cells broadcasting
their identity on global level, E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier (ECGI).
{width="6.530555555555556in" height="3.863888888888889in"}
Figure 22.3.3-1: Automatic Neighbor Relation Function
The function works as follows:
The eNB serving cell A has an ANR function. As a part of the normal call
procedure, the eNB instructs each UE to perform measurements on neighbor
cells. The eNB may use different policies for instructing the UE to do
measurements, and when to report them to the eNB. This measurement procedure
is as specified in [16].
1\. The UE sends a measurement report regarding cell B. This report contains
Cell B's PCI, but not its ECGI.
When the eNB receives a UE measurement report containing the PCI, the
following sequence may be used.
2\. The eNB instructs the UE, using the newly discovered PCI as parameter, to
read the ECGI, the TAC and all available PLMN ID(s) of the related neighbour
cell. To do so, the eNB may need to schedule appropriate idle periods to allow
the UE to read the ECGI from the broadcast channel of the detected neighbour
cell. How the UE reads the ECGI is specified in [16].
3\. When the UE has found out the new cell's ECGI, the UE reports the detected
ECGI to the serving cell eNB. In addition the UE reports the tracking area
code and all PLMN IDs that have been detected.
4\. The eNB decides to add this neighbour relation, and can use PCI and ECGI
to:
a Lookup a transport layer address to the new eNB.
b Update the Neighbor Relation List.
c If needed, setup a new X2 interface towards this eNB. The setup of the X2
interface is described in section 22.3.2.
### 22.3.4 Inter-RAT/Inter-frequency Automatic Neighbour Relation Function
{width="6.530555555555556in" height="4.530555555555556in"}
Figure 22.3.4-1: Automatic Neighbor Relation Function in case of UTRAN
detected cell
For Inter-RAT and Inter-Frequency ANR, each cell contains an Inter Frequency
Search list. This list contains all frequencies that shall be searched.
For Inter-RAT cells, the NoX2 attribute in the NRT is absent, as X2 is only
defined for E-UTRAN.
The function works as follows:
The eNB serving cell A has an ANR function. During connected mode, the eNB can
instruct a UE to perform measurements and detect cells on other
RATs/frequencies. The eNB may use different policies for instructing the UE to
do measurements, and when to report them to the eNB.
1 The eNB instructs a UE to look for neighbour cells in the target
RATs/frequencies. To do so the eNB may need to schedule appropriate idle
periods to allow the UE to scan all cells in the target RATs/frequencies.
2 The UE reports the PCI of the detected cells in the target RATs/frequencies.
The PCI is defined by the carrier frequency and the Primary Scrambling Code
(PSC) in case of UTRAN FDD cell, by the carrier frequency and the cell
parameter ID in case of UTRAN TDD cell, by the Band Indicator + BSIC + BCCH
ARFCN in case of GERAN cell and by the PN Offset in case of CDMA2000 cell.
When the eNB receives UE reports containing PCIs of cell(s) the following
sequence may be used.
3 The eNB instructs the UE, using the newly discovered PCI as parameter, to
read the CGI and the RAC of the detected neighbour cell in case of GERAN
detected cells, CGI, LAC and, RAC in case of UTRAN detected cells and CGI in
case of CDMA2000 detected cells. For the Interfrequency case, the eNB
instructs the UE, using the newly discovered PCI as parameter, to read the
ECGI, TAC and all available PLMN ID(s) of the inter-frequency detected cell.
The UE ignores transmissions from the serving cell while finding the requested
information transmitted in the broadcast channel of the detected inter-
system/inter-frequency neighbour cell. To do so, the eNB may need to schedule
appropriate idle periods to allow the UE to read the requested information
from the broadcast channel of the detected inter-RAT/inter-frequency neighbour
cell.
4 After the UE has read the requested information in the new cell, it reports
the detected CGI and RAC (in case of GERAN detected cells) or CGI, LAC and RAC
(in case of UTRAN detected cells) or CGI (in case of CDMA2000 detected cells)
to the serving cell eNB. In the inter-frequency case, the UE reports the ECGI,
the, tracking area code and all PLMN-ID(s) that have been detected.
5 The eNB updates its inter-RAT/inter-frequency Neighbour Relation Table.
In the inter-frequency case and if needed, the eNB can use the PCI and ECGI
for a new X2 interface setup towards this eNB. The setup of the X2 interface
is described in section 22.3.2.
### 22.3.5 Framework for PCI Selection
The eNB shall base the selection of its PCI either on a centralized or
distributed PCI assignment algorithm:
[Centralized PCI assignment] The OAM signals a specific PCI value. The eNB
shall select this value as its PCI.
[Distributed PCI assignment] The OAM signals a list of PCI values. The eNB may
restrict this list by removing PCI-s that are:
a) reported by UEs;
b) reported over the X2 interface by neighboring eNBs; and/or
c) acquired through other implementation dependent methods, e.g. heard over
the air using a downlink receiver.
The eNB shall select a PCI value randomly from the remaining list of PCIs.
### 22.3.6 TNL address discovery
#### 22.3.6.1 TNL address discovery of candidate eNB via S1 interface
If the eNB is aware of the eNB ID of the candidate eNB (e.g. via the ANR
function) but not a TNL address suitable for SCTP connectivity, then the eNB
can utilize the Configuration Transfer Function to determine the TNL address
as follows:
\- The eNB sends the eNB CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message to the MME to request
the TNL address of the candidate eNB, and includes relevant information such
as the source and target eNB ID.
\- The MME relays the request by sending the MME CONFIGURATION TRANSFER
message to the candidate eNB identified by the target eNB ID.
\- The candidate eNB responds by sending the eNB CONFIGURATION TRANSFER
message containing one or more TNL addresses to be used for SCTP connectivity
with the initiating eNB, and includes other relevant information such as the
source and target eNB ID.
\- The MME relays the response by sending the MME CONFIGURATION TRANSFER
message to the initiating eNB identified by the target eNB ID.
# 23 Others
## 23.1 Support for real time IMS services
## 23.2 Subscriber and equipment trace
Support for subscriber and equipment trace for E-UTRAN and EPC shall be as
specified in [29], [30] and [31].
### 23.2.1 Signalling activation
All traces are initiated by the core network, even if the trace shall be
carried out in the radio network.
If the eNB has received an UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message where the UE is
associated to an E-UTRAN Trace Id then the eNB shall terminate the on-going
Trace.
The following functionality is needed on the S1 and X2 interface:
\- Support for inclusion of subscriber and equipment trace information in
INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message over the S1 interface.
\- Support for an explicit TRACE START message over the S1 interface.
\- Support for inclusion of subscriber and equipment trace information in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message over the X2 interface.
\- Support for inclusion of subscriber and equipment trace information in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message over the S1 interface.
A trace setup in the radio network will be propagated on the X2 interface at
handover and on the S1 interface if the handover is carried out between MMEs.
### 23.2.2 Management activation
All conditions for Cell Traffic Trace are defined by the O&M. When the
condition to start the trace recording is fulfilled the eNB will allocate a
Trace Recording Session Reference and send it together with the Trace
Reference to the MME in a CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message over the S1 interface.
Cell Traffic trace will not be propagated on the X2 interface or on the S1
interface in case of handover.
## 23.3 E-UTRAN Support for Warning Systems
The E-UTRAN provides support for warning systems through means of system
information broadcast capability. The E-UTRAN performs scheduling and
broadcasting of the \"warning message content\" received from the CBC, which
is forwarded to the E-UTRAN by the MME. The schedule information for the
broadcast is received along with the \"warning message content\" from the CBC.
The E-UTRAN is also responsible for paging the UE to provide indication that
the warning notification is being broadcast. The \"warning message content\"
received by the E-UTRAN contains an instance of the warning notification.
Depending on the size, E-UTRAN may segment the secondary notification before
sending it over the radio interface.
### 23.3.1 Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System
ETWS is a public warning system developed to meet the regulatory requirements
for warning notifications related to earthquake and/or tsunami events. ETWS
warning notifications can either be a primary notification (short
notifications delivered within 4 seconds [32]) or secondary notification
(providing detailed information). The ETWS primary notification is broadcast
in _SystemInformationBlockType10_ while the secondary notification is
broadcast in _SystemInformationBlockType11_.
###### ## Annex A (informative): NAS Overview
This subclause provides for information an overview on services and functions
provided by the NAS control protocol..
# A.1 Services and Functions
The main services and functions of the NAS sublayer include:
\- EPS Bearer control (see 3GPP TR 23.401 [17]);
\- ECM-IDLE mobility handling;
\- Paging origination;
\- Configuration and control of Security.
# A.2 NAS protocol states & state transitions
The NAS state model is based on a two-dimensional model which consists of EPS
Mobility Management (EMM) states describing the mobility management states
that result from the mobility management procedures e.g. Attach and Tracking
Area Update procedures, and of EPS Connection Management (ECM) states
describing the signalling connectivity between the UE and the EPC (see 3GPP TS
23.401 [17]).
NOTE: The ECM and EMM states are independent of each other and when the UE is
in EMM-CONNECTED state this does not imply that the user plane (radio and S1
bearers) is established.
The relation between NAS and AS states is characterised by the following
principles:
\- **EMM-DEREGISTERED & ECM-IDLE â‡’** RRC_IDLE:
\- Mobility: PLMN selection:
\- UE Position: not known by the network.

###### ## Annex B (informative): MAC and RRC Control
The E-UTRA supports control signalling in terms of MAC control signalling
(PDCCH and MAC control PDU) and RRC control signalling (RRC message).
# B.1 Difference between MAC and RRC control
The different characteristics of MAC and RRC control are summarized in the
table below.
Table B.1-1: Summary of the difference between MAC and RRC control

                           MAC control                     RRC control

* * *
The main difference between MAC and RRC control lies in the signalling
reliability. Due to the signalling reliability, signalling involving state
transitions and radio bearer configurations should be performed by RRC.
Basically, all signalling performed by RRC in UTRA should also be performed by
RRC also for E-UTRA.

###### ## Annex C (informative): System Information
This annex provides an overview of the classification and division of system
information between static and flexible parts. Considerations about dedicated
distribution of system information are also included.
# C.1 SI classification
Five categories are identified for system information classification:
1\. Information valid across multiple cells;
2\. Information needed at cell/PLMN search;
3\. Information needed prior to cell camping;
4\. Information needed before cell access;
5\. Information needed while camping on a cell.
From UEs' point of view, the information that is needed at cell selection and
prior to camping are very similar. Before a UE can camp on a cell, it needs to
know if the access is allowed in that cell. Thus it would be very beneficial
to know all access restrictions already at cell search phase.
## C.1.1 Information valid across multiple cells
The pieces of information that can be valid across multiple cells are:
\- A-GNSS assistance data;
\- PLMN identity(ies);
\- Tracking area identity;
Note: the above text will be revised if it is agreed that a cell can be a
member of more than one tracking area.
\- Predefined configuration information;
\- System Frame Number if it does not change from cell to cell (in case of
synchronized network);
\- Some measurement/mobility information (FFS).
## C.1.2 Information needed at cell/PLMN search
In order to support full mobility within the serving frequency layer, the UEs
need to perform cell search rather often and thus it is seen very important
that the information needed in cell search phase is readily available, thereby
improving cell search times and minimizing UE power consumption. If system
information decoding is needed for identifying a cell, fast system information
reception is needed in order to avoid too long identification times. For
optimising PLMN search and make PLMN search fast and non-complex, the
information needed for PLMN search should be easily available. The pieces of
information that are needed at cell/PLMN search are:
\- PLMN identity(ies): in order to acquire information to which PLMN the cell
belongs, UEs need to receive PLMN identity(ies);
NOTE: There may be multiple PLMN identities for one cell.
\- Measurement cell identity (FFS): there needs to be a cell identity in the
system information, in order to allow UEs to identify the cell reliably for
measurement purposes.
NOTE: UEs may identify the cell also based on the reference sequence
detection;\ There is another cell identity that identifies the cell within
e.g. PLMN.
NOTE: UEs may have to check possible cell access restrictions before selecting
cell/PLMN;\ For cell/PLMN search UEs might need some L1 parameters.
## C.1.3 Information needed prior to cell camping
Before a UE can camp on a cell, it needs to know any access related parameters
in order to avoid camping on cells where access is forbidden. Thus prior to
camping on a cell, a UE needs to know the following information:
\- Any cell access restriction parameters, e.g.:
\- Tracking area identity: if the forbidden TA concept is adopted from legacy
systems, then the UE needs to know whether the cell belongs to such forbidden
TA.
Note: the above text will be revised if it is agreed that a cell can be a
member of more than one tracking area.
\- Cell barring status and cell reservation status (FFS if needed per PLMN):
the UE needs to know whether the cell is barred or reserved in order to avoid
camping on a barred cell. Possibly also barring time might be needed in order
to avoid UE to poll barring time frequently from the system information.
Another option is that barring status is indicated also in the neighbour cell
list.
\- Radio access limitation parameters:
\- Any radio condition parameters that limit the access to the cell e.g.
similar to GSM C1/S criteria;
\- It is FFS if we need to have some band information indication also, in
order to allow UEs to check possible band support before camping on the cell.
NOTE: UE may need some L1 parameters prior to camping.
## C.1.4 Information needed prior to cell access
Once a UE has camped on a cell, the information needed prior to cell access
(transmission/reception) includes at least:
\- System Frame Number (SFN) (FFS)
\- SFN is probably needed by the UE to understand the scheduling parameters
(e.g. scheduling information for secondary SI, RACH, PCH, E-MBMS etc.)
\- L1 information, example set of needed L1 parameters:
Note: RAN1 needs to define what parameters are needed at this phase.
\- Carrier Bandwidth: FFS if separate bandwidths for UL and DL are needed;
\- Carrier center frequency (FFS);
\- Cyclic Prefix parameters: in order to decode DL-SCH UE needs to know the CP
length arrangements;
\- MIMO related parameters: in order to take advantage of the multi-antenna
transmissions like MIMO, the UE needs to know parameters of number of TX
antennas, DL/UL pre-coding matrices, etc...;
\- Band Information: may be needed if the same DL carrier frequency has
variable UL carrier frequency;
\- PDCCH, PHICH and PUCCH structure parameters: if PDCCH has variable
configurations, the UE may need to know its channel structure at least partly.
PDCCH is crucial to receive any allocation information. If Random Access
Response is transmitted without PDCCH (e.g. synchronous transmission with
Random Access Preamble), this information might not be required;
\- RACH parameters (needed by the UE to start usage of RACH):
\- RACH scheduling information: UE needs to know where in time (sub-frame) and
frequency (Physical Resource Units) the RACH channel is located;
\- RACH sequences: UE needs to know the RACH set of sequences to choose from.
The sequences may not be fully of equal meaning (e.g. CQI can be classified
for the sequences in a specific way);
\- Access class restrictions: access class restrictions might be needed to
limit the number of possible UEs using RACH;
\- Persistence values: possible persistence value scheme parameters are needed
for RACH usage;
\- Other parameters related to RACH: UE needs to know the timers and
parameters related to RACH e.g. how often the UE retransmits RACH and how many
times the retransmission is allowed etc;
\- RACH power control parameters: UE needs to know parameters related to UL
power control.
## C.1.5 Information needed while camping on a cell
When a UE has camped on a cell, it needs to continue measuring the
neighbouring cells in order to stay camped. The pieces of information required
for that are:
\- Measurement parameters:
\- In order for the UE to start mobility procedures, it needs to receive
parameters e.g. of reporting periods, reporting event parameters, time to
trigger etc. UEs in RRC_IDLE state need cell reselection parameters. UEs in
RRC_CONNECTED state need parameters of the neighbour cells e.g. for handover
and for error recovery cases.
\- Neighbour cell lists are needed to start neighbour cell measurements. UEs
in different states may use different sets of neighbour cell lists. Neighbour
cell list may contain following parameters:
\- Some L1 parameters: FFS what parameters are needed in the neighbour cell
list;
\- All information that is needed for camping: see sub-clauses C.2.2 and C.2.3
(FFS);
\- Synchronization information: indicating whether the neighbouring cell is
synchronized to the current cell i.e. the cell sending the neighbour cell list
(FFS);
\- PLMN identity(ies) & tracking area identity (FFS);
Note: The above text will be revised if it is agreed that a cell can be a
member of more than one tracking area.
\- Other 3GPP RAT information: e.g. neighbour cell information of GERAN/UTRAN
cells;
\- Information of non-3GPP access systems (e.g. WIMAX).
\- Secondary NAS parameters:
\- An y NAS parameters that were not presented earlier e.g. cell identity
uniquely identifying cell within wide area e.g. PLMN;
\- Cell identity (PLMN level) (FFS if this should be in category "Information
needed prior to cell access").
\- Secondary UE timer values: any timer values that affect UE's behaviour.
\- Paging parameters: UEs in ECM-IDLE state need to receive paging parameters
e.g. DRX periods and scheduling.
\- Clock time (FFS): the network might send system clock in order to let UEs
update their clock time e.g. in the user interface;
\- MBMS service parameters: any parameters needed for MBMS reception e.g. MBMS
multiplexing parameters, MBMS frequency;
NOTE: the presence of these parameters also indicate the presence of MBMS
service in the cell (dedicated or mixed cell).
\- Signalling Radio Bearer parameters: may be broadcasted unless they are
standardized.
## C.1.6 Thoughts about category division
From UEs' point of view the categories in sub-clauses C.1.2 and C.1.3 are very
similar. Thus it is questionable whether we need to differentiate procedures
between cell search/selection/camping and PLMN search.
From UEs' point of view, the difference between the procedure for cell search
during RRC_CONNECTED and the procedure for cell search during RRC_IDLE state
maybe small. When the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED state, it measures the neighbour
cell and executes handovers commanded by the network.
# C.2 Division of SI between static and flexible parts
System information distribution can be classified into two distinctive parts:
static and flexible. Static part is sent more often, say once per frame, in
the cell and has quite a limited capacity for information transfer. The
flexible part has flexible amount of scheduled resources available and thus
most of the SI information is contained there.
## C.2.1 Static part
The static parts of the System Information are:
\- L1 information in order to decode the rest of the information
Note: detailed information on the required information will be defined by
RAN1;
\- Measurement Cell identity (FFS): it may be possible that L1 channels do not
identify the cell. Then some Cell identity needs to be sent on system
information part;
\- Any cell access restriction parameters e.g.:
\- Tracking area identity: if forbidden TA concept is adopted from legacy
systems then UEs need to know whether the cell belongs to forbidden TA;
Note: the above text will be revised if it is agreed that a cell can be a
member of more than one tracking area.
\- Cell barring and cell reservation status (FFS if needed per PLMN): UEs need
to know whether cell is barred or reserved in order to avoid camping on barred
cell. Possibly also barring time might be needed in order to avoid UEs to poll
barring time frequently from the system information;
\- Radio access limitation parameters: any radio condition parameters that
limit the access to the cell e.g. similar to GSM C1/S criteria;
\- PLMN identity(ies): in order to acquire information to which PLMN cell
belongs, UEs need to receive PLMN identity(ies).
NOTE: there may be multiple PLMN identities for one cell.
  * Scheduling parameters:
\- All of the scheduling information of flexible part or part of scheduling
information (e.g. scheduling block) of flexible part. If static part consists
of multiple SI blocks then it may be necessary to have scheduling information
of those blocks in the static part.
\- Scheduling block defines, from where (time and frequency resources) to
decode the SI blocks of the scheduled flexible part. It may be possible that
scheduling of scheduling block is standardized, then this information can be
omitted from the static part. If several types of scheduling blocks are
defined , scheduling information might be sent for each scheduling block.
\- Value_tag(s): informs whether the information transmitted on the flexible
part has changed. This is needed in order to avoid UEs from reading any
unchanged information repeatedly. Another possibility is to send this
information in PDCCH, but possibly it would cause too much overhead.
NOTE: It also is possible to include Value_tag for SI on the flexible part
indicating more precisely what changes have occurred in the system
information.
NOTE: There may be a need for indicating changes in static part with value tag
also, if static part consists of multiple SI blocks.
Table C.2.1-1 gives an estimate of the size of the elements mentioned above.
Table C.2.1-1: Initial rough estimates for static part capacity requirement
+---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Information element | > Bits | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Cyclic Prefix (FFS) | > 2 | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Carrier BW (FFS) | > 3-8 | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > MIMO parameters (FFS) | > 2 (+ 3) | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Cell Id (FFS) | > 9 | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Tracking Area Id (+ FFS how many additional) | > [16-28] | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Cell Barring status+ possible Time of barring | > 1+4 | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Cell reservation status | > [2] | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Radio access limitation parameters | > 12 | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > PLMN id(s) maximum of 5 ( 24 bits per one) - see Note | > 120 | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Scheduling parameters | > (12-108) | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > Value Tag | > 4 | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+ | > SFN (FFS) | > 11 | +---------------------------------------------------------+-------------+
NOTE: It might not be necessary to send the Mobile Country Code part of the
PLMN identity for each indicated PLMN to limit the number of bits.
## C.2.2 Flexible part
The flexible part has different types of Information Elements which require
independent scheduling in order to allow fast enough reception and not to
waste transmission capacity. For example, the requirement to receive cell
access parameters is very different than e.g. the clock time. Thus following
flexible part division should be considered:
\- Scheduling block: scheduling information of the secondary part of the
System Information.
\- Access parameters:
\- All parameters not present in the primary part (e.g. some L1 parameters);
\- RACH parameters;
\- Power control parameters;
\- Paging parameters;
\- Any timer values needed for operating in the cell and in the network.
\- Measurement related parameters:
\- Neighbour cell lists;
\- Cell selection/reselection parameters;
NOTE: Some of these parameters are included in the static part element "Radio
access limitation parameters."
\- Measurement control information;
\- Non vital information:
\- Clock time;
\- Positioning (A-GNSS etc.) information;
\- Service parameters (e.g. MBMS parameters);
\- Secondary NAS parameters.
## C.2.3 Information whose location is FFS
The location of the following information is FFS:
\- System Frame Number: SFN might be needed very fast i.e. for HO purposes.
SFN might be needed also for decoding scheduling block parameters, but on the
other hand it might be requested not to send often changing information on the
static part in order to be able to make time soft combining. Further
investigation on the SFN broadcasting is thus needed.
## C.2.4 Dedicated part
The dedicated part is embedded in the RRC message that is meant for sending
System Information Elements in unicast mode e.g. for HO purposes, positioning
purposes .... The UE needs some information for the neighbouring cell to
access it, this is needed to limit the interruption times caused by HO
execution. When a UE receives a HO COMMAND it needs at least following
information from the target cell:
\- All information in the static part (see sub-clause C.2.1): may be received
by the UE by itself;
\- Most of the information from the access parameters (see sub-clause C.2.2):
is favourably delivered by dedicated manner via the source cell, because the
UE might not have time to get all the necessary secondary SI from the target
cell;
\- System Frame Number is needed to minimize the interruption times during the
HO procedure. Most probably the UE needs to receive (at least confirm) the SFN
directly by the neighbour cell SI reading, because giving the SFN via source
cell may cause some inaccuracy to the SFN.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Void
###### ## Annex E (informative): Drivers for Mobility Control
Table E-1 lists the drivers, limitations, and their applicability to intra-
frequency, inter-frequency, and inter-RAT scenarios. Each driver and
limitation is described in Section E.1 and E.2, respectively. For inter-
frequency and inter-RAT scenarios, the applicable drivers are shown in detail
for IDLE/ACTIVE modes and their transitions in Section E.3.
Table E-1: Drivers and limitations for mobility control and applicability to
mobility scenarios.

* * *
As shown in Table E.1, the applicable drivers depend on the mobility scenario,
i.e., intra-frequency, inter-frequency, and inter-RAT:
\- **Intra-frequency mobility** : intra-frequency mobility is the most
fundamental, indispensable, and frequent scenario. With the frequency reuse
being one in E-UTRAN, applying any driver other than the "best radio
condition" to intra-frequency mobility control incur increased interference
and hence degraded performance. As such, only the "best radio condition"
driver is applicable to intra-frequency mobility. Note that the exact
definition of "intra-frequency mobility" is yet unclear, and shall be
clarified with RAN1.
\- **Inter-frequency mobility** : as in UTRAN, an operator may have multiple
carriers/bands for E-UTRAN working in parallel. The use of these frequency
layers may be diverse. For example, some of these frequency layers may utilise
the same eNB sites and antenna locations (i.e., co-located configuration),
whereas some may be used to form a hierarchical cell structure (HCS), or even
be used for private networks. Some frequency layers may provide MBMS services,
while some may not. Moreover, E-UTRAN carriers/bands may be extended in the
future to increase capacity. For example, as E-UTRAN gains popularity, an
operator may decide to convert existing UTRAN carriers into E-UTRAN ones. The
operator may also acquire additional carriers/bands, that are not necessarily
contiguous. As a consequence, different UE band capabilities may coexist and
different carriers/bands may operate at different areas within a network. The
E-UTRAN standard should readily support such carrier/band extensions and
diverse network configurations, providing flexibility and efficiency.
Therefore, a number of drivers apply to inter-frequency mobility control, in
addition to the "best radio condition" driver.
\- **Inter-RAT mobility** : the aspects that need to be considered for inter-
RAT are similar to those for inter-frequency. For mobility solutions to be
complete with the inter-RAT drivers, relevant updates would be necessary on
the legacy (UTRAN/GERAN) specifications. This will add to the limitations,
which are evidently more effective in inter-RAT. Although the
drivers/limitations need to be assessed per objective RAT (UTRAN/GERAN), the
solutions should be made common as much as possible to reduce any complexity.
## E.1 Drivers
The drivers for mobility control are described in the following sections.
### E.1.1 Best radio condition
The primary purpose of cell reselection, regardless of intra-frequency, inter-
frequency, or inter-RAT, is to ensure that the UE camps on/connects to the
best cell in terms of radio condition, e.g., path loss, received reference
symbol power, or received reference symbol Es/I0. The UE should support
measurements to suffice this aspect. For E-UTRAN cells, the frequency domain
scheduling and channel/symbol mapping may have some implications to designing
the measurements and reselection/reporting criteria. The UE would also have to
check that the selected cell falls within the accessible range (in terms of
signal strength and possibly also in terms of propagation delay, i.e., check
if it falls within the dynamic range of timing advance, FFS).
E-UTRAN should support good mobility even when the radio environment changes
suddenly, e.g., when the UE enters a tunnel or in a Manhattan-like street cell
scenario. It should be discussed whether a special mechanism is needed to cope
with such sudden changes in radio environment or it can be handled with good
radio network planning practices. In either case, the system design should
minimise any side effects of counteracting the sudden changes in the radio
environment (e.g., ping-pongs).
For inter-frequency/RAT mobility, the UE needs idle gaps to perform
measurements on other frequency layers/RATs. In addition, for inter-RAT,
E-UTRAN measurements while the UE is in another RAT (UTRAN/GERAN) need to be
supported. It should be discussed whether in certain cases (e.g., co-located
E-UTRAN cells within the same frequency band) the measurements can be omitted.
### E.1.2 Camp load balancing
This is to distribute idle state UEs among the available bands/carriers/RATs,
such that upon activation, the traffic loading of the bands/carriers/RATs
would be balanced. At least the path loss difference between different bands
should be compensated to avoid UEs concentrating to a certain frequency layer
(e.g., lower frequency bands due to the propagation nature). A deliberate
mechanism would be necessary to avoid UEs concentrating to a certain RAT
(e.g., E-UTRAN). Various solutions have been presented including the use of
Qoffset and an approach of limiting the frequency layers for camping.
For inter-RAT, this driver also includes the aspect of balancing the loading
of core network nodes of different RATs. Nevertheless, for intra- E-UTRAN, the
core network load aspect is out of scope, since MME/Serving Gateway relocation
by itself should not cause any radio mobility procedure (but only NAS
procedures like NAS ID and security updates).
### E.1.3 Traffic load balancing
This is to balance the loading of active state UEs, using redirection for
example. In E-UTRAN, traffic load balancing is essential because of the shared
channel nature. That is, the user throughput decreases as the number of active
UEs in the cell increases, and the loading directly impacts on the user
perception. A solution is desired that causes minimum impact on the user
perception. This implies that inter-layer transitions are preferably done
during data inactivity (e.g., DRX) or transition to the idle state. Although
this driver is also applicable to inter-RAT, for inter-RAT, the "service
dependent control" driver may be more dominant than the load balancing aspect.
### E.1.4 UE capability
As E-UTRAN bands/carriers may be extended in the future, UEs having different
band capabilities may coexist within a network. It is also likely that roaming
UEs have different band capabilities. Overlaying different RATs adds to this
variety. The mobility solution should cope with the coexistence of various UE
capabilities in an efficient manner.
### E.1.5 Hierarchical cell structures
As in UTRAN, hierarchical cell structures (HCS) may be utilised in E-UTRAN to
cover for example, indoors and hot spots efficiently. It is possible that
E-UTRAN is initially deployed only at hot spots, in which case this driver
becomes essential for inter-RAT, not just for inter-frequency. Another use
case would be to deploy a large umbrella cell to cover a vast area without
having to deploy a number of regular cells, while providing capacity by the
regular cells on another frequency. While HCS can be seen as a solution to
reduce measurement and signalling loads, to optimise HCS usage, mobility
control should take into account the UE mobility (e.g., speed). This however
implies that sufficient mobility detection is also required. Although HCS is
not addressed as a mobility driver for intra-frequency mobility, intra-
frequency HCS deployment should not be restricted.
### E.1.6 Network sharing
At the edge of a shared portion of a network, it will be necessary to direct
UEs belonging to different PLMNs to different target cells. The mobility
solutions in both idle and active states should therefore support
differentiation between UEs of different operators.
### E.1.7 Private networks/home cells
Cells that are part of a sub-network should prioritise the camping on that
sub-network. UEs that do not belong to private sub-networks should not attempt
to camp or access them. Although this could be resolved by the use of
forbidden TAs as in UTRAN, a more deliberate mechanism may be needed as some
of these sub-networks could be very small, e.g., one home.
### E.1.8 Subscription based mobility control
This mobility driver aims to limit the inter-RAT mobility for certain UEs,
e.g., based on subscription or other operator policies. The system should
provide means to disallow access on certain RATs (including E-UTRAN) as done
with \"LA reject\" in legacy systems. It should be possible for the operator
to trigger a subsequent UE action such as a cell or PLMN selection.
### E.1.9 Service based mobility control
An operator may have different policies in allocating frequencies to certain
services. For example, the operator may concentrate VoIP UEs to a certain
frequency layer or RAT (e.g., UTRAN or GERAN), if evaluations prove this
effective. UEs requiring higher data rates may better be served on a frequency
layer or RAT (e.g., E-UTRAN) having a larger bandwidth. The operator may also
want to accommodate premium services on a certain frequency layer or RAT, that
has better coverage or larger bandwidth.
This driver is essential for inter-RAT, due to the different QoS levels
provided by different RATs. The nature of the service being requested (e.g.,
QoS and traffic behaviour) should be considered in controlling mobility, so
that services are accommodated in the best suitable RAT. Note that such
service dependent control shall only be based on network decisions and not on
UE decisions (i.e., no UE based service dependent cell reselection), except
for MBMS scenarios.
### E.1.10 MBMS
As MBMS services may be provided only in certain frequency layers, it may be
beneficial/necessary to control inter-frequency/RAT mobility depending on
whether the UE receives a particular MBMS service or not. For MBMS scenarios
only, UE based service dependent cell reselection might be considered
acceptable. This aspect also depends on the UE capability for simultaneous
reception of MBMS and unicast.
## E.2 Limitations for mobility control
While the issues mentioned above drive E-UTRAN towards "aggressive" mobility
control, the limiting factors also have to be considered. The factors listed
below apply to all intra-frequency, inter-frequency, and inter-RAT mobility
scenarios.
### E.2.1 UE battery saving
The mobility solution should not consume excessive UE battery, e.g., due to
measurements, measurement reporting, BCH reception, or TA update signalling.
This could be achieved for example by setting appropriate measurement rules
such as S-criteria, hysteresis, and time-to-trigger. Adaptive control of some
measurement/mobility parameters (e.g., based on DRX, cell size, or mobility)
may also be considered as a countermeasure. To reduce TA update signalling, TA
allocations can be differentiated depending on the UE speed or the mobility
vector, on top of appropriate TA planning. Effects on additional delays (e.g.,
paging) should also be investigated if means such as "long DRX" are used to
achieve these savings.
It should be investigated together with RAN4 if a coupling between
measurements accuracy and DRX (as in UTRAN) is also acceptable for E-UTRAN.
### E.2.2 Network signalling/processing load
The mobility solution should not cause excessive network signalling/processing
load. This includes over-the-air signalling, S1/X2 signalling, and processing
load at network nodes. Unnecessary handovers and cell reselections should be
avoided, and PCH and BCH signalling, as well as dedicated signallings, should
be limited. This could be achieved by similar countermeasures as for UE
battery saving.
### E.2.3 U-plane interruption and data loss
U-plane interruption and data loss caused by the mobility solution should be
limited. The required QoS should be satisfied in any case.
### E.2.4 OAM complexity
The mobility solution should not demand excessive efforts in
operating/maintaining a network. For example, when a new eNB is added or an
existing eNB fails, the mobility solution should not incur excessive efforts
to set up or modify the parameters. Means should be studied to integrate the
mobility solutions in the concept of "self-optimisation" to minimise manual
processes. Reducing the neighbour list information in E-UTRAN would also be a
countermeasure to this requirement.
## E.3 Inter-frequency/RAT drivers
### E.3.1 Mobility control during IDLE mode
This is to control the mobility of UEs during IDLE mode, i.e., cell
reselection. Table E.3.1-1 summarises applicability of the drivers for
different inter-frequency/RAT scenarios and necessary features to support the
drivers. Note that in Tables E.3.1-1, E.3.2-1, E.3.3-1, E.3.4-1, an "X" in the
table indicates that the driver is essential, whereas an \"(X)\" indicates
that the driver may be reduced in support depending on the complexity

###### ## Annex F (informative): Mobility and Access Control Requirements
associated with Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Cells
## F.1 Access Control
The following description is provided from the perspective of the Home cell
deployment, and is used as an example to understand the general requirements
of Closed Subscriber Group (**CSG**) Cells.
If an operator uses the 2G or 3G systems for a deployment in a home, there are
some limitations imposed by mandating that only a UE from a specific User
Group can access the cell. This access restriction is needed because some
backhaul links for this type of deployment are not considered to provide
adequate QoS to support a large numbers of UEs, or there may be regulatory
issues with sharing the backhaul link/eNB access in that location, and
additionally the backhaul maybe owned by the subscriber and they may not be
happy to share the link with other subscribers.
In 3G, the Access Control would work based on the Location Updating or Routing
Area Updating Reject for the LA or RA which is being signalled on the cell.
Each unique User Group would require its Location Area ID, however the LAC of
the LA ID is only 2 octets, which needs to be shared with the normal LAs of
the PLMN.
There is an additional drawback with this solution in 3G, which is that all
terminals would attempt to perform the Location Updating procedure on a cell
advertising a LA not on the list of forbidden LAs in the UE. The network would
reject the location updating procedure of those UEs which are not in the User
Group associated with the LA. This would lead to the scenario in a densely
populated area, where a UE moving down the street could attempt to access a
home cell at each house, before being rejected causing a wastage of battery in
the terminal, and unnecessary signalling/processing load in the core network.
**1\. A UE should not camp on or access a CSG Cell if it is not part of the
User Group which is allowed to access that CSG Cell.**
It shall be possible to update the User Group associated with a specific Home-
eNB, e.g. based on request by the registered owner of the Home-eNB, under the
supervision of the network operator. When a subscriber is added to the User
Group for the Home-eNB, the UE of the newly added subscriber should be able to
(almost) immediately camp on the cell(s) of Home-eNB and then may acquire
service through the Home-eNB. This is especially important in the deployment
scenario where this subscriber has no other means to access the network, i.e.
there is no Macro-layer coverage available. For this it might be necessary to
update the list of allowed CSG cells for a particular UE by network signalling
or other means.
**2\. The subscriber registered as the owner of a CSG Cell or group of Cells,
under supervision of the operator, shall be able to control/modify quickly
which other subscribers form part of the User Group associated with its CSG
Cell(s).**
## F.2 Mobility
The Home-eNB/CSG cells should form part of the network of the operator, and
therefore the design needs to support mobility of UEs between the Macro-Layer
network and the Home-eNB/CSG cells. In the following text, what is called
Macro layer encompasses all the cells which are not from the CSG being
considered i.e. it is not about their size/coverage but the fact that they are
not closed.
**3\. The system shall support bidirectional handover between CSG Cells and
any eNodeB (E-UTRAN) or RNC (UTRAN) or BSS (GERAN) or with another CSG Cell of
the same or different CSG.**
The Home-eNBs will be deployed to improve network coverage, improve network
capacity as well as offer differential billing models. As the User billing
could be dependent on whether the UE is using the Home-eNB, it is important
that the UE when it is range of the Home-eNB automatically camps on the Home-
eNB.
**4\. It shall be possible to allow UEs which are allowed to access a given
CSG cell, to prioritise their camping towards the CSG Cells when in coverage
of the CSG cells. To achieve this it should be possible either to set the
reselection parameters accordingly or other means should allow this.**
It is important that UEs camped on the Home-eNB do not cause excessive
signalling load or processing load if/when the UE moves frequently between the
Macro-Layer network and the Home-eNB.
**5\. The system shall avoid excessive signalling and processing load from a
UE frequently reselecting in LTE Idle between the CSG Cells and the non-CSG
cells of eNodeB (E-UTRAN) or RNC (UTRAN) or BSS (GERAN).**
As discussed above, the Home-eNBs will have an associated User Group
describing which UEs can access the Home-eNB. The handover procedures needs to
take the User Group of the Target Home-eNB into account when deciding whether
to handover a UE to a specific Home-eNB. The solution for the mobility to/from
the Home-eNB should avoid unnecessary signalling between the RAN nodes.
**6\. The handover procedures shall take into account whether a UE is part of
the User Group of the target CSG Cell. The mobility procedures should allow
for prioritisation of the CSG Cells in ECM-CONNECTED when the UE enters
coverage of a CSG Cell and the UE is part of the User Group of this cell.**
As the number of Home-eNBs in the network will become large, the proportion of
measurements made by a UE which could be wasted may become large, to the point
where it affects the mobility performance of the UE/system, as well as
draining the battery of the UE. It is therefore necessary for the UE to be
able to avoid unnecessary measurements of Home-eNBs where the UE does not
belong to the User Group of the Home-eNB.
**7\. It shall be possible to minimise the quantity of measurements which UEs
perform on CSG Cells, if the UE does not belong to the User Group of a
specific CSG Cell.**
Due to the high number of Home-eNBs and the nature of their deployment, it
would not be practical to change the configuration for the mobility procedures
(measurements, handover, etc.) in the macro layer nodes when a Home-eNB is
deployed/dismissed.
**8\. The mobility procedures shall allow a large number of (small) CSG Cells
to be deployed within the coverage of e-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN macro-layer
cells. Deployment of (additional) CSG Cells shall not require reconfiguration
of other eNodeB (E-UTRAN) or RNC (UTRAN) or BSS (GERAN).**
In order to minimise the impact on UEs not allowed to use CSG cells or not
allowed to use a particular CSG cell, means shall be provided which allow the
UE to either identify prior to cell reselection that the configured neighbour
cell is a CSG cell or means shall be provided which do not impact the UEs on
the macro cells.
**9\. The mobility procedures for moving UEs to CSG cells shall minimise
impact to other UEs on the same macro cells not entitled to use CSG cells or a
given CSG cell.**
It is expected that the CSG identity of a Home-eNB is static and this identity
can be used by the UE to clearly identify the Home-eNB. In contrast the
Physical Cell Identity (PCI) of a Home-eNB might change at power up. For
example, a Home-eNB may scan the neighbour environment at every switch on, and
a PCI unused by the neighbours can be selected. In most cases this will end up
on the same PCI being used, as the neighbour environment did not change.
During operation the Home-eNB might also change the PCI on a slow basis, in
case high interference is detected. If the PCI changes, mobility shall still
be supported without user intervention. It might be necessary that the change
is notified to the UEs belonging to the CSG through network signalling or
other means.
**10\. The Physical Cell Identity (PCI) of a Home-eNB might change at each
power up of the Home-eNB. Although a change of PCI is expected to be
infrequent, if it changes, mobility shall still be supported without user
intervention.**
The carrier frequency of a Home-eNB might only be changed during Home-eNB
power up, out of a preconfigured range of frequencies. Often the pre-
configured frequency range would be limited to one. If the frequency is
changed, mobility shall still be supported without user intervention.
**11\. The carrier frequency of a Home-eNB might be changed at power up of the
Home-eNB, out of a preconfigured range of frequencies. Often the preconfigured
frequency range would be limited to one. Although a change of frequency is
expected to be infrequent, if it changes, mobility shall still be supported
without user intervention.**
## F.3 Mobility performance guidelines
For outbound mobility from CSG cells to non-CSG cells, normal mobility
procedures shall apply, i.e., network controlled mobility. As such, the normal
mobility performance requirements as for non-CSG mobility should apply.
**12\. For outbound mobility from CSG cells to non-CSG cells, both for idle
and active mode mobility, the normal mobility performance requirements as for
non-CSG mobility shall apply.**
For inbound mobility to CSG cells in active mode, it is important that the
overall handover time perceived by the user, i.e., from the time the user
arrives at home till the UE is connected to the CSG cell, is sufficiently
short, considering that different charging policies may be applicable to CSG.
However, this should not cause severe impacts on the battery consumption. It
is thought that the time taken depends largely on UE implementation of the
autonomous CSG search, as it is expected that the UE will apply means to
reduce battery consumption in verifying the location (to trigger CSG search,
based e.g., on "fingerprint"). However, this factor is thought to be existent
only in the case the CSG cell is deployed on a different frequency as the
serving cell, as for intra-frequency case the UE should be able to detect the
CSG cell naturally through normal intra-frequency cell search. Therefore, in
case of intra-frequency mobility, the handover should be completed in the
order of 1 s. In case of inter-frequency mobility, 10-30 s is expected
including the autonomous CSG search time.
**13\. For inbound mobility to CSG cells in active mode, the cell search, CSG
identification, and handover process shall be completed in the order of 1 s in
case of intra-frequency mobility. In case of inter-frequency mobility, 10-30 s
is expected including the autonomous CSG search time.**
For inbound mobility to CSG cells in idle mode, in case of intra-frequency
mobility, the same requirements as for non-CSG reselection should apply also
to inbound reselection to CSG cells. For inter-frequency mobility, the inbound
mobility is not as time critical. However, considering applicability of
different tariffs and CSG/ Home-eNB identifiers to be displayed on the
terminal screen, it is desirable that the UE camps on the suitable CSG cell
without excessive delay. It is desirable that inbound cell reselection is
possible within 20-60 s. If UE battery consumption becomes a critical issue,
this requirement can be revisited.
**14\. For inbound mobility to CSG cells in idle mode, cell reselection shall
be completed as for normal non-CSG reselection in case of intra-frequency
mobility. In case of inter-frequency mobility, it is desirable that inbound
cell reselection is possible within 20-60 s.**
If the PCI or the carrier frequency of the CSG cell changes, the UE shall be
able to detect this change autonomously. It is expected that the UE would look
for the CSG cell based on the PCI/ carrier frequency as last stored in its
memory and based on the fingerprint. Then, the UE would detect absense of the
CSG cell from where it was expected, and initiate a full scan of the CSG cell.
By checking the global cell identity of detected CSG cells, the UE should
eventually find the CSG cell on a new PCI or carrier frequency. Such
autonomous procedure shall be completed within [6 min, FFS]. Once the CSG cell
has been found, the requirements 12 and 13 shall apply then on.
**15\. If the PCI or the carrier frequency of the CSG cell changes, the UE
shall be able to detect this change within [6 min, FFS]. The performance
requirements 11 and 12 shall apply then on.**
###### ## Annex G (informative): Guideline for E-UTRAN UE capabilities
Each radio access technology has defined specific "classes" of terminals in
terms of radio capabilities. E.g. in GPRS the "multislot classes" are defined,
in UMTS R'99 different dedicated bearer classes are defined and for HSDPA and
HSUPA 12 respectively 6 physical layer categories are defined. The definition
of UMTS R'99 UE classes lead to 7 DL classes and 7 UL classes for FDD out of
which only 2 DL and 3 UL classes were commercially realized. Furthermore the
lower end classes (e.g. 64 UL and 64 DL) disappeared from the market with
commercialization of the UMTS networks quite soon. Besides these class
definitions a huge number of possible parameter combinations (to achieve
certain data rates) exist with UMTS R'99 which lead to the huge number of RAB
and RB combinations defined. Further activities in the early phase of UMTS
standardization aimed to reduce the number of possible combinations
significantly.
For HSDPA two "simple" DL categories (11 & 12) with lowered complexity were
defined with the intent to speed up commercialization of HSDPA. Originally
those categories should have been removed for Rel-6. Out of the 12 defined
categories only approx. 4 will be realized in commercial HSDPA platform
products. A similar situation is likely for HSUPA as well as for the
combinations of HSDPA/HSUPA.
Generally the aim to mandate certain essential functions/requirements can help
to simplify the system definition as well as the realization options (e.g.
mandating 20 MHz of DL reception as well as 20 MHz UL transmission bandwidth
significantly reduced the E-UTRAN system complexity). Especially mandating
certain terminal functions could be useful for the system design if a defined
subset of parameter combinations are also supported by the systems, e.g. the
eNB scheduler. However, there is also a risk that not all the defined E-UTRA
features are deployed in the networks at the time when terminals are made
commercially available on the market place. Some features are likely to be
rather large and complex, which further increases the risk of interoperability
problems unless these features have undergone sufficient interoperability
testing (IOT) on real network equipment, and preferably with more than one
network in order to improve the confidence of the UE implementation. Thus,
avoiding unnecessary UE mandatory features but instead defining a limited set
of UE radio classes allows simplification for the interoperability testing.
Given the discussion above, it seems beneficial for the introduction of
E-UTRAN to limit the combination of radio capabilities to a clearly defined
subset and ensure that a given set of parameters is supported by certain UE
classes as well as networks for rapid E-UTRAN deployment. It seems unrealistic
to mandate only one single UE class which always mandates the maximum
capability.
In order to address the different market requirements (low end, medium and
high end), the definition of the following UE classes are proposed:
Table G-1: E-UTRAN UE Classes
+---------+---------------+----------------+ | > Class | > UL | > DL | +---------+---------------+----------------+ | > A | > [50] Mbps | > [100] Mbps | +---------+---------------+----------------+ | > B | > [25] Mbps | > [50] Mbps | +---------+---------------+----------------+ | > C | > [2] Mbps | > [2] Mbps | +---------+---------------+----------------+
> NOTE: For simplification reasons, the table only depict the UE capabilities
> in terms of uplink and downlink peak data rates supported. However, it
> should be noted that further discussion on other features is expected once
> the work progresses.
It may require further discussion whether there be a need for an additional
terminal class between 2 Mbps and 50 Mbps classes. It might make sense, since
up to 5 MHz band allocations may be rather common in real deployments for
several years. This would point to bit rate class of 25 Mbps in DL and 10 Mbps
in UL.
The above given data rates are indicative and should be subject for further
discussions in 3GPP RAN working groups. Depending on the different solutions
to reach those data rates, the target should be to define [3..4] UE classes in
different data rate ranges, and other parameters affecting device complexity
and cost. The definition of the required parameters/features is for further
study for each of the classes. For instance, half-duplex UEs form a specific
category that may be frequency band specific.
> NOTE: the support of half-duplex UEs is mandatory for the eNB where such a
> category is allowed in the frequency band supported by the eNB.
The aim is to ensure on the one hand that high end E-UTRAN UEs, supporting
data rates representing state of the art level and competitive with other
radio technologies are defined, while the medium and lower data rates aim to
reduce implementation cost for chipset/terminal vendors and allow adoption of
most cost efficient solutions for different market segments. It is expected
that the support of the high end data rate terminals is ensured from the very
beginning.
Another clear exception from this exercise is that on the low end very cheap
product implementation is possible (e.g. for the machine-to-machine market or
the voice and very low data rate only segment -- to substitute GSM in the
medium term) while top end performance is needed for data applications in
notebooks, wireless gateways ("wireless DSL"), etc.
Another important aspect that must be ensured is that a higher capability UE
can be treated in exactly the same way as for a lower capability UE, if the
network wishes to do so, e.g., in case the network does not support some
higher capability features. In HSDPA, there has been problems in this respect
due to 2-stage rate matching in HARQ. Such problems should be avoided in
E-UTRAN, and E-UTRAN UE capabilities should provide the compatibility to ease
implementation and interoperability testing.
