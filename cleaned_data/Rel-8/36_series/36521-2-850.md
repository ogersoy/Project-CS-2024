# Introduction
The present document is part 2 of a multi-parts TS:
3GPP TS 36.521-1 [1]: Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA);
User Equipment (UE) conformance specification Radio transmission and reception
Part 1: Conformance testing.
**3GPP TS 36.521-2: Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); User
Equipment (UE) conformance specification Radio transmission and reception Part
:2 Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS).**
3GPP TS 36.521-3 [2]: Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA);
User Equipment (UE) conformance specification Radio transmission and reception
Part 3: Radio Resource Management Conformance Testing.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS)
proforma for 3G Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) User
Equipment (UE), in compliance with the relevant requirements, and in
accordance with the relevant guidance given in ISO/IEC 9646-1 [3] and ISO/IEC
9646-7 [4]
The present document specifies the recommended applicability statement for the
test cases included in 3GPP TS 36.521-1 [1] and 3GPP TS 36.521-3 [2]. These
applicability statements are based on the features implemented in the UE.
Special conformance testing functions can be found in 3GPP TS 36.509 [5] and
the common test environments are included in 3GPP TS 36.508 [6].
The present document is valid for UE implemented according to 3GPP releases
starting from Release 8 up to the Release indicated on the cover page of the
present document.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.
\- For a Release 8 UE, references to 3GPP documents are to version 8.x.y, when
available.
Editor\'s Note: The Reference list is incomplete and some references are still
to UMTS specs.
