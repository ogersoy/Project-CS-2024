# 4 Frame structure
Throughout this specification, unless otherwise noted, the size of various
fields in the time domain is expressed as a number of time units$T_{s} =
1/\left( \text{15000} \times \text{2048} \right)$ seconds.
Downlink and uplink transmissions are organized into radio frames with $T_{f}
= \text{307200} \times T_{s} = \text{10}\text{\ ms}$ duration. Two radio frame
structures are supported:
\- Type 1, applicable to FDD,
\- Type 2, applicable to TDD.
## 4.1 Frame structure type 1
Frame structure type 1 is applicable to both full duplex and half duplex FDD.
Each radio frame is $T_{f} = \text{307200} \cdot T_{s} = \text{10}\text{\ ms}$
long and consists of 20 slots of length$T_{\text{slot}} = \text{15360} \cdot
T_{s} = 0\text{.}5\text{\ ms}$, numbered from 0 to 19. A subframe is defined
as two consecutive slots where subframe $i$ consists of slots $2i$and$2i + 1$.
For FDD, 10 subframes are available for downlink transmission and 10 subframes
are available for uplink transmissions in each 10 ms interval. Uplink and
downlink transmissions are separated in the frequency domain. In half-duplex
FDD operation, the UE cannot transmit and receive at the same time while there
are no such restrictions in full-duplex FDD.
Figure 4.1-1: Frame structure type 1.
## 4.2 Frame structure type 2
Frame structure type 2 is applicable to TDD. Each radio frame of length $T_{f}
= \text{307200} \cdot T_{s} = \text{10}\text{\ ms}$ consists of two half-
frames of length $\text{153600} \cdot T_{s} = 5\text{\ ms}$each. Each half-
frame consists of five subframes of length$3\text{0720} \cdot T_{s} = 1\text{\
ms}$. The supported uplink-downlink configurations are listed in Table 4.2-2
where, for each subframe in a radio frame, "D" denotes the subframe is
reserved for downlink transmissions, "U" denotes the subframe is reserved for
uplink transmissions and "S" denotes a special subframe with the three fields
DwPTS, GP and UpPTS. The length of DwPTS and UpPTS is given by Table 4.2-1
subject to the total length of DwPTS, GP and UpPTS being equal to$3\text{0720}
\cdot T_{s} = 1\text{\ ms}$. Each subframe $i$_is_ defined as two slots,
$2i$and$2i + 1$ of length $T_{\text{slot}} = \text{15360} \cdot T_{s} =
0\text{.}5\text{\ ms}$in each subframe.
Uplink-downlink configurations with both 5 ms and 10 ms downlink-to-uplink
switch-point periodicity are supported.
In case of 5 ms downlink-to-uplink switch-point periodicity, the special
subframe exists in both half-frames.
In case of 10 ms downlink-to-uplink switch-point periodicity, the special
subframe exists in the first half-frame only.
Subframes 0 and 5 and DwPTS are always reserved for downlink transmission.
UpPTS and the subframe immediately following the special subframe are always
reserved for uplink transmission.

# 5 Uplink
## 5.1 Overview
The smallest resource unit for uplink transmissions is denoted a resource
element and is defined in section 5.2.2.
### 5.1.1 Physical channels
An uplink physical channel corresponds to a set of resource elements carrying
information originating from higher layers and is the interface defined
between 36.212 and 36.211. The following uplink physical channels are defined:
\- Physical Uplink Shared Channel, PUSCH
\- Physical Uplink Control Channel, PUCCH
\- Physical Random Access Channel, PRACH
### 5.1.2 Physical signals
An uplink physical signal is used by the physical layer but does not carry
information originating from higher layers. The following uplink physical
signals are defined:
\- Reference signal
## 5.2 Slot structure and physical resources
### 5.2.1 Resource grid
The transmitted signal in each slot is described by a resource grid of
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$ subcarriers and
$N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{UL}}$ SC-FDMA symbols. The resource grid is
illustrated in Figure 5.2.1-1. The quantity $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}$
depends on the uplink transmission bandwidth configured in the cell and shall
fulfil
where $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{min,UL}} = 6$ and $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{max,UL}} =
\text{110}$ is the smallest and largest uplink bandwidth, respectively,
supported by the current version of this specification. The set of allowed
values for $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}$ is given by [7].
The number of SC-FDMA symbols in a slot depends on the cyclic prefix length
configured by higher layers and is given in Table 5.2.3-1.
Figure 5.2.1-1: Uplink resource grid.
### 5.2.2 Resource elements
Each element in the resource grid is called a resource element and is uniquely
defined by the index pair $\left( k,l \right)$ in a slot where $k =
0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}
- 1$ and $l = 0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{UL}} - 1$ are
the indices in the frequency and time domain, respectively. Resource element
$\left( k,l \right)$ corresponds to the complex value $a_{k,l}$_._ Quantities
$a_{k,l}$ corresponding to resource elements not used for transmission of a
physical channel or a physical signal in a slot shall be set to zero.
### 5.2.3 Resource blocks
A physical resource block is defined as
$N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{UL}}$consecutive SC-FDMA symbols in the time domain
and $N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$consecutive subcarriers in the frequency
domain, where $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{UL}}$ and $N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$
are given by Table 5.2.3-1. A physical resource block in the uplink thus
consists of $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{UL}} \times N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$
resource elements, corresponding to one slot in the time domain and 180 kHz in
the frequency domain.
Table 5.2.3-1: Resource block parameters.

Normal cyclic prefix 12 7 Extended cyclic prefix 12 6

The relation between the physical resource block number $n_{\text{PRB}}$ in
the frequency domain and resource elements $(k,l)$ in a slot is given by
## 5.3 Physical uplink shared channel
The baseband signal representing the physical uplink shared channel is defined
in terms of the following steps:
\- scrambling
\- modulation of scrambled bits to generate complex-valued symbols
\- transform precoding to generate complex-valued symbols
\- mapping of complex-valued symbols to resource elements
\- generation of complex-valued time-domain SC-FDMA signal for each antenna
port
Figure 5.3-1: Overview of uplink physical channel processing.
### 5.3.1 Scrambling
The block of bits$b(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b(M_{\text{bit}} - 1)$, where
$M_{\text{bit}}$ is the number of bits transmitted on the physical uplink
shared channel in one subframe, shall be scrambled with a UE-specific
scrambling sequence prior to modulation, resulting in a block of scrambled
bits$\overset{\sim}{b}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\overset{\sim}{b}(M_{\text{bit}}
- 1)$ according to the following pseudo code
Set _i_ = 0
while _i_ \ Else // Data or channel quality coded bits, Rank Indication coded bits or
> ACK/NAK coded bits
>
> end if
end if
_i_ = _i_ \+ 1
end while
where x and y are tags defined in [3] section 5.2.2.6 and where the scrambling
sequence $c(i)$ is given by Section 7.2. The scrambling sequence generator
shall be initialised with $c_{\text{init}} = n_{\text{RNTI}} \cdot
2^{\text{14}} + \left\lfloor n_{s}/2 \right\rfloor \cdot 2^{9} +
N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ at the start of each subframe where
$n_{\text{RNTI}}$ corresponds to the RNTI associated with the PUSCH
transmission [as described in Section 8[4]]{.underline}.
### 5.3.2 Modulation
The block of scrambled bits
$\overset{\sim}{b}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\overset{\sim}{b}(M_{\text{bit}}
- 1)$shall be modulated as described in Section 7.1, resulting in a block of
complex-valued symbols$d(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d(M_{\text{symb}} - 1)$.
Table 5.3.2-1 specifies the modulation mappings applicable for the physical
uplink shared channel.
Table 5.3.2-1: Uplink modulation schemes
* * *
Physical channel Modulation schemes PUSCH QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM
* * *
### 5.3.3 Transform precoding
The block of complex-valued symbols
$d(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d(M_{\text{symb}} - 1)$ is divided into
$M_{\text{symb}}/M_{\text{sc}}^{\text{PUSCH}}$ sets, each corresponding to one
SC-FDMA symbol. Transform precoding shall be applied according to
resulting in a block of complex-valued symbols
$z(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},z(M_{\text{symb}} - 1)$. The
variable$M_{\text{sc}}^{\text{PUSCH}} = M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PUSCH}} \cdot
N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$, where $M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PUSCH}}$ represents
the bandwidth of the PUSCH in terms of resource blocks, and shall fulfil
where $\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3},\alpha_{5}$ is a set of non-negative integers.
### 5.3.4 Mapping to physical resources
The block of complex-valued symbols
$z(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},z(M_{\text{symb}} - 1)$ shall be multiplied
with the amplitude scaling factor $\beta_{\text{PUSCH}}$ in order to conform
to the transmit power $P_{\text{PUSCH}}$specified in Section 5.1.1.1 in [4],
and mapped in sequence starting with $z(0)$to physical resource blocks
assigned for transmission of PUSCH. The mapping to resource elements $\left(
k,l \right)$ corresponding to the physical resource blocks assigned for
transmission and not used for transmission of reference signals and not
reserved for possible SRS transmission shall be in increasing order of first
the index$k$, then the index$l$, starting with the first slot in the subframe.
If uplink frequency-hopping is disabled, the set of physical resource blocks
to be used for transmission are given by $n_{\text{PRB}} =
n_{\text{VRB}}$where $n_{\text{VRB}}$ is obtained from the uplink scheduling
grant as described in Section 8.1 in [4].
If uplink frequency-hopping with type 1 PUSCH hopping is enabled, the set of
physical resource blocks to be used for transmission are given by Section
8.4.1 in [4].
If uplink frequency-hopping with predefined hopping pattern is enabled, the
set of physical resource blocks to be used for transmission in slot $n_{s}$ is
given by the scheduling grant together with a predefined pattern according to
where $n_{\text{VRB}}$ is obtained from the scheduling grant as described in
Section 8.1 in [4]. The parameter _pusch-HoppingOffset_
,$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{HO}}$, is provided by higher layers.. The size
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{sb}}$ of each sub-band is given by,
where the number of sub-bands $N_{\text{sb}}$ is given by higher layers. The
function $f_{m}(i) \in \left{ 0,1 \right}$ determines whether mirroring is
used or not. The parameter _Hopping-mode_ provided by higher layers determines
if hopping is "inter-subframe" or "intra and inter-subframe".
The hopping function $f_{\text{hop}}(i)$and the function$f_{m}(i)$ are given
by
where $f_{\text{hop}}( - 1)$=0 and the pseudo-random sequence $c(i)$ is given
by section 7.2 and CURRENT_TX_NB indicates the transmission number for the
transport block transmitted in slot $n_{s}$as defined in [8]. The pseudo-
random sequence generator shall be initialised with $c_{\text{init}} =
N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ for FDD and $c_{\text{init}} = 2^{9} \cdot
(n_{f}\text{mod}4) + N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ for TDD at the start of each
frame.
## 5.4 Physical uplink control channel
The physical uplink control channel, PUCCH, carries uplink control
information. The PUCCH is never transmitted simultaneously with the PUSCH from
the same UE. For frame structure type 2, the PUCCH is not transmitted in the
UpPTS field.
The physical uplink control channel supports multiple formats as shown in
Table 5.4-1. Formats 2a and 2b are supported for normal cyclic prefix only.
Table 5.4-1: Supported PUCCH formats.
* * *
PUCCH format Modulation scheme Number of bits per subframe, $M_{\text{bit}}$ 1
N/A N/A 1a BPSK 1 1b QPSK 2 2 QPSK 20 2a QPSK+BPSK 21 2b QPSK+QPSK 22
* * *
All PUCCH formats use a cyclic shift of a sequence in each symbol, where
$n_{\text{cs}}^{\text{cell}}(n_{s},l)$ is used to derive the cyclic shift for
the different PUCCH formats. The quantity
$n_{\text{cs}}^{\text{cell}}(n_{s},l)$ varies with the symbol number $l$ and
the slot number $n_{s}$ according to
where the pseudo-random sequence $c(i)$ is defined by section 7.2. The pseudo-
random sequence generator shall be initialized with $c_{\text{init}} =
N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ at the beginning of each radio frame.
The physical resources used for PUCCH depends on two parameters,
$N_{\text{RB}}^{(2)}$ and $N_{\text{cs}}^{(1)}$, given by higher layers. The
variable $N_{\text{RB}}^{(2)} \geq 0$ denotes the bandwidth in terms of
resource blocks that are available for use by PUCCH formats 2/2a/2b
transmission in each slot. The variable $N_{\text{cs}}^{(1)}$ denotes the
number of cyclic shift used for PUCCH formats 1/1a/1b in a resource block used
for a mix of formats 1/1a/1b and 2/2a/2b. The value of $N_{\text{cs}}^{(1)}$
is an integer multiple of $\Delta_{\text{shift}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ within the
range of {0, 1, ..., 7}, where $\Delta_{\text{shift}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ is
provided by higher layers. No mixed resource block is present if
$N_{\text{cs}}^{(1)} = 0$. At most one resource block in each slot supports a
mix of formats 1/1a/1b and 2/2a/2b. Resources used for transmission of PUCCH
format 1/1a/1b and 2/2a/2b are represented by the non-negative indices
$n_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(1)}$ and $n_{\text{PUCCH}}^{(2)}  0$starts at time
$\sum_{}^{}{(N_{\text{CP},l^{'}} + N)T_{s}}$ within the slot.
Table 5.6-1lists the values of $N_{\text{CP},l}$that shall be used. Note that
different SC-FDMA symbols within a slot may have different cyclic prefix
lengths.

## 5.7 Physical random access channel
### 5.7.1 Time and frequency structure
The physical layer random access preamble, illustrated in Figure 5.7.1-1,
consists of a cyclic prefix of length$T_{\text{CP}}$ and a sequence part of
length$T_{\text{SEQ}}$. The parameter values are listed in Table 5.7.1-1 and
depend on the frame structure and the random access configuration. Higher
layers control the preamble format.

The transmission of a random access preamble, if triggered by the MAC layer,
is restricted to certain time and frequency resources. These resources are
enumerated in increasing order of the subframe number within the radio frame
and the physical resource blocks in the frequency domain such that index 0
correspond to the lowest numbered physical resource block and subframe within
the radio frame. PRACH resources within the radio frame are indicated by a
PRACH Resource Index, where the indexing is in the order of appearance in
Table 5.7.1-2 and Table 5.7.1-4.
For frame structure type 1 with preamble format 0-3, there is at most one
random access resource per subframe. Table 5.7.1-2 lists the preamble formats
according to Table 5.7.1-1 and the subframes in which random access preamble
transmission is allowed for a given configuration in frame structure type 1.
The parameter _prach-ConfigurationIndex_ is given by higher layers. The start
of the random access preamble shall be aligned with the start of the
corresponding uplink subframe at the UE assuming $N_{\text{TA}} = 0$, where
$N_{\text{TA}}$ is defined in section 8.1. For PRACH configuration 0, 1, 2,
15, 16, 17, 18, 31, 32, 33, 34, 47, 48, 49, 50 and 63 the UE may for handover
purposes assume an absolute value of the relative time difference between
radio frame $i$ in the current cell and the target cell of less than
$\text{153600} \cdot T_{s}$. The first physical resource block
$n_{\text{PRB}}^{\text{RA}}$ allocated to the PRACH opportunity considered for
preamble format 0, 1, 2 and 3 is defined as $n_{\text{PRB}}^{\text{RA}} =
n_{\text{PRB}\text{offset}}^{\text{RA}}$, where the parameter _prach-
FrequencyOffset_ $n_{\text{PRBoffset}}^{\text{RA}}$ is expressed as a physical
resource block number configured by higher layers and fulfilling $0 \leq

For frame structure type 2 with preamble format 0-4, there might be multiple
random access resources in an UL subframe (or UpPTS for preamble format 4)
depending on the UL/DL configuration [see table 4.2-2]. Table 5.7.1-3 lists
PRACH configurations allowed for frame structure type 2 where the
configuration index corresponds to a certain combination of preamble format,
PRACH density value, $D_{\text{RA}}$, and version index, $r_{\text{RA}}$. The
parameter _prach-ConfigurationIndex_ is given by higher layers. For frame
structure 2 PRACH configuration 0, 1, 2, 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42,
48, 49 and 50, the UE may for handover purposes assume an absolute value of
the relative time difference between radio frame $i$in the current cell and
the target cell is less than $\text{153600} \cdot T_{s}$.

Table 5.7.1-4 lists the mapping to physical resources for the different random
access opportunities needed for a certain PRACH density value,
$D_{\text{RA}}$. Each quadruple of the format
$(f_{\text{RA}},t_{\text{RA}}^{0},t_{\text{RA}}^{1},t_{\text{RA}}^{2})$
indicates the location of a specific random access resource, where
$f_{\text{RA}}$ is a frequency resource index within the considered time
instance, $t_{\text{RA}}^{0} = 0,1,2$indicates whether the resource is
reoccurring in all radio frames, in even radio frames, or in odd radio frames,
respectively, $t_{\text{RA}}^{1} = 0,1$ indicates whether the random access
resource is located in first half frame or in second half frame, respectively,
and where $t_{\text{RA}}^{2}$ is the uplink subframe number where the preamble
starts, counting from 0 at the first uplink subframe between 2 consecutive
downlink-to-uplink switch points, with the exception of preamble format 4
where $t_{\text{RA}}^{2}$ is denoted as (*). The start of the random access
preamble formats 0-3 shall be aligned with the start of the corresponding
uplink subframe at the UE assuming $N_{\text{TA}} = 0$ and the random access
preamble format 4 shall start $\text{4832} \cdot T_{s}$ before the end of the
UpPTS at the UE, where the UpPTS is referenced to the UE's uplink frame timing
assuming$N_{\text{TA}} = 0$.
The random access opportunities for each PRACH configuration shall be
allocated in time first and then in frequency if and only if time multiplexing
is not sufficient to hold all opportunities of a PRACH configuration needed
for a certain density value $D_{\text{RA}}$ without overlap in time. For
preamble format 0-3, the frequency multiplexing shall be done according to
where $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}}$ is the number of uplink resource blocks,
$n_{\text{PRB}}^{\text{RA}}$is the first physical resource block allocated to
the PRACH opportunity considered and where the parameter _prach-
FrequencyOffset_ $n_{\text{PRB}\text{offset}}^{\text{RA}}$ is the first
physical resource block available for PRACH expressed as a physical resource
block number configured by higher layers and fulfilling $0 \leq
n_{\text{PRBoffset}}^{\text{RA}} \leq N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{UL}} - 6$.
For preamble format 4, the frequency multiplexing shall be done according to
where$n_{f}$is the system frame number and where$N_{\text{SP}}$is the number
of DL to UL switch points within the radio frame.
Each random access preamble occupies a bandwidth corresponding to 6
consecutive resource blocks for both frame structures.

### 5.7.2 Preamble sequence generation
The random access preambles are generated from Zadoff-Chu sequences with zero
correlation zone, generated from one or several root Zadoff-Chu sequences. The
network configures the set of preamble sequences the UE is allowed to use.
There are 64 preambles available in each cell. The set of 64 preamble
sequences in a cell is found by including first, in the order of increasing
cyclic shift, all the available cyclic shifts of a root Zadoff-Chu sequence
with the logical index RACH_ROOT_SEQUENCE, where RACH_ROOT_SEQUENCE is
broadcasted as part of the System Information. Additional preamble sequences,
in case 64 preambles cannot be generated from a single root Zadoff-Chu
sequence, are obtained from the root sequences with the consecutive logical
indexes until all the 64 sequences are found. The logical root sequence order
is cyclic: the logical index 0 is consecutive to 837. The relation between a
logical root sequence index and physical root sequence index $u$ is given by
Tables 5.7.2-4 and 5.7.2-5 for preamble formats 0 -- 3 and 4, respectively.
The $u^{\text{th}}$ root Zadoff-Chu sequence is defined by
where the length $N_{\text{ZC}}$ of the Zadoff-Chu sequence is given by Table
5.7.2-1. From the $u^{\text{th}}$ root Zadoff-Chu sequence, random access
preambles with zero correlation zones of length $N_{\text{CS}} - 1$are defined
by cyclic shifts according to
where the cyclic shift is given by
and $N_{\text{CS}}$ is given by Tables 5.7.2-2 and 5.7.2-3 for preamble
formats 0-3 and 4, respectively. The parameter _High-speed-flag_ provided by
higher layers determines if unrestricted set or restricted set shall be used.
The variable $d_{u}$ is the cyclic shift corresponding to a Doppler shift of
magnitude $1/T_{\text{SEQ}}$ and is given by
where $p$ is the smallest non-negative integer that fulfils $\left( \text{pu}
\right)\text{mod}N_{\text{ZC}} = 1$. The parameters for restricted sets of
cyclic shifts depend on $d_{u}$. For$N_{\text{CS}} \leq d_{u} 
\text{10}$ Number of OFDM symbols for PDCCH when $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{DL}}
\leq \text{10}$ Subframe 1 and 6 for frame structure type 2 1, 2 2 MBSFN

carrier not supporting PDSCH 0 0 All other cases 1, 2, 3 2, 3, 4

The PCFICH shall be transmitted when the number of OFDM symbols for PDCCH is
greater than zero.
### 6.7.1 Scrambling
The block of bits $b(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b(\text{31})$ transmitted in
one subframe shall be scrambled with a cell-specific sequence prior to
modulation, resulting in a block of scrambled
bits$\overset{\sim}{b}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\overset{\sim}{b}(\text{31})$according
to
where the scrambling sequence $c(i)$ is given by Section 7.2. The scrambling
sequence generator shall be initialised with $c_{\text{init}} = \left(
\left\lfloor n_{s}/2 \right\rfloor + 1 \right) \cdot \left(
2N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} + 1 \right) \cdot 2^{9} +

complex-valued modulation symbols$d(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d(\text{15})$.

with$M_{\text{symb}}^{(0)} = \text{16}$ and precoded according to one of
Sections 6.3.4.1 or 6.3.4.3, resulting in a block of vectors $y(i) =
\begin{bmatrix} y^{(0)}(i) & \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} & y^{(P - 1)}(i) \
\end{bmatrix}^{T}$, $i = 0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\text{15}$, where

0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},P - 1$and the number of antenna ports for cell-
specific reference signals $P \in \left{ 1,2,4 \right}$. The PCFICH shall be
transmitted on the same set of antenna ports as the PBCH.
### 6.7.4 Mapping to resource elements
The mapping to resource elements is defined in terms of quadruplets of
complex-valued symbols. Let $z^{(p)}(i) = \left\langle y^{(p)}(4i),y^{(p)}(4i
+ 1),y^{(p)}(4i + 2),y^{(p)}(4i + 3) \right\rangle$ denote symbol quadruplet
$i$ for antenna port$p$. For each of the antenna ports, symbol quadruplets
shall be mapped in increasing order of $i$ to the four resource-element groups

and $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ is the physical-layer cell identity as given
by Section 6.11.
## 6.8 Physical downlink control channel
### 6.8.1 PDCCH formats
The physical downlink control channel carries scheduling assignments and other
control information. A physical control channel is transmitted on an
aggregation of one or several consecutive control channel elements (CCEs),
where a control channel element corresponds to 9 resource element groups. The
number of resource-element groups not assigned to PCFICH or PHICH is
$N_{\text{REG}}$. The CCEs available in the system are numbered from 0 and
$N_{\text{CCE}} - 1$, where $N_{\text{CCE}} = \left\lfloor
\frac{N_{\text{REG}}}{9} \right\rfloor$. The PDCCH supports multiple formats
as listed in Table 6.8.1-1. A PDCCH consisting of $n$ consecutive CCEs may
only start on a CCE fulfilling$i\text{mod}n = 0$, where $i$ is the CCE number.
Multiple PDCCHs can be transmitted in a subframe.

each of the control channels to be transmitted in a subframe, where
$M_{\text{bit}}^{(i)}$ is the number of bits in one subframe to be transmitted
on physical downlink control channel number $i$, shall be multiplexed,
resulting in a block of
bits$b^{(0)}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b^{(0)}(M_{\text{bit}}^{(0)} -

a cell-specific sequence prior to modulation, resulting in a block of
scrambled bits
$\overset{\sim}{b}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\overset{\sim}{b}(M_{\text{tot}}
- 1)$according to
where the scrambling sequence $c(i)$ is given by Section 7.2. The scrambling
sequence generator shall be initialised with $c_{\text{init}} = \left\lfloor
n_{s}/2 \right\rfloor 2^{9} + N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ at the start of
each subframe.
CCE number $n$ corresponds to bits $b(\text{72}n),b(\text{72}n +
1),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b(\text{72}n + \text{71})$. If necessary, \
elements shall be inserted in the block of bits prior to scrambling to ensure
that the PDCCHs starts at the CCE positions as described in [4] and to ensure
that the length $M_{\text{tot}} = 8N_{\text{REG}} \geq
\sum_{}^{}M_{\text{bit}}^{(i)}$ of the scrambled block of bits matches the
amount of resource-element groups not assigned to PCFICH or PHICH.
### 6.8.3 Modulation
The block of scrambled
bits$\overset{\sim}{b}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\overset{\sim}{b}(M_{\text{tot}}

complex-valued modulation
symbols$d(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d(M_{\text{symb}} - 1)$. Table 6.8.3-1
specifies the modulation mappings applicable for the physical downlink control
channel.

$d(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d(M_{\text{symb}} - 1)$ shall be mapped to
layers according to one of Sections 6.3.3.1 or 6.3.3.3 with
$M_{\text{symb}}^{(0)} = M_{\text{symb}}$ and precoded according to one of
Sections 6.3.4.1 or 6.3.4.3, resulting in a block of vectors $y(i) =
\begin{bmatrix} y^{(0)}(i) & \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} & y^{(P - 1)}(i) \
\end{bmatrix}^{T}$, $i = 0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},M_{\text{symb}} - 1$ to be
mapped onto resources on the antenna ports used for transmission, where
$y^{(p)}(i)$ represents the signal for antenna port $p$. The PDCCH shall be
transmitted on the same set of antenna ports as the PBCH.
### 6.8.5 Mapping to resource elements
The mapping to resource elements is defined by operations on quadruplets of
complex-valued symbols. Let $z^{(p)}(i) = \left\langle y^{(p)}(4i),y^{(p)}(4i
+ 1),y^{(p)}(4i + 2),y^{(p)}(4i + 3) \right\rangle$ denote symbol quadruplet
$i$ for antenna port$p$.
The block of
quadruplets$z^{(p)}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},z^{(p)}(M_{\text{quad}} - 1)$
, where $M_{\text{quad}} = M_{\text{symb}}/4$, shall be permuted resulting in
$w^{(p)}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},w^{(p)}(M_{\text{quad}} - 1)$. The
permutation shall be according to the sub-block interleaver in Section
5.1.4.2.1 of [3] with the following exceptions:
  * the input and output to the interleaver is defined by symbol quadruplets instead of bits
  * interleaving is performed on symbol quadruplets instead of bits by substituting the terms "bit", "bits" and "bit sequence" in Section 5.1.4.2.1 of [3] by "symbol quadruplet", "symbol quadruplets" and "symbol-quadruplet sequence", respectively
\ elements at the output of the interleaver in [3] shall be removed when
forming $w^{(p)}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},w^{(p)}(M_{\text{quad}} - 1)$.
Note that the removal of \ elements does not affect any \ elements
inserted in Section 6.8.2.
The block of quadruplets
$w^{(p)}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},w^{(p)}(M_{\text{quad}} - 1)$ shall be
cyclically shifted, resulting in
${\overline{w}}^{(p)}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\overline{w}}^{(p)}(M_{\text{quad}}
- 1)$ where${\overline{w}}^{(p)}\left( i \right) = w^{(p)}\left( (i +
N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}})\text{mod}M_{\text{quad}} \right)$.
Mapping of the block of quadruplets
${\overline{w}}^{(p)}(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\overline{w}}^{(p)}(M_{\text{quad}}
- 1)$ is defined in terms of resource-element groups, specified in Section
6.2.4, according to steps 1--10 below:
1) Initialize $m^{'} = 0$ (resource-element group number)
2) Initialize $k' = 0$
3) Initialize $l' = 0$
4) If the resource element $(k^{'},l^{'})$ represents a resource-element group
and the resource-element group is not assigned to PCFICH or PHICH then perform
step 5 and 6, else go to step 7
5) Map symbol-quadruplet ${\overline{w}}^{(p)}(m')$ to the resource-element
group represented by $(k^{'},l^{'})$ for each antenna port $p$
6) Increase $m^{'}$ by 1
7) Increase $l'$ by 1
8) Repeat from step 4 if $l'  in case of extended PHICH duration in MBSFN subframes, or extended PHICH
> duration in subframe 1 and 6 for frame structure type 2 and by
>
> otherwise.
9) Increase $m^{'}$ by 1.
10) Repeat from step 5 until all PHICH mapping units have been assigned.
The PHICH duration is configurable by higher layers according to Table
6.9.3-1. The duration configured puts a lower limit on the size of the control
region signalled by the PCFICH.

## 6.10 Reference signals
Three types of downlink reference signals are defined:
\- Cell-specific reference signals, associated with non-MBSFN transmission
\- MBSFN reference signals, associated with MBSFN transmission
\- UE-specific reference signals
There is one reference signal transmitted per downlink antenna port.
### 6.10.1 Cell-specific reference signals
Cell-specific reference signals shall be transmitted in all downlink subframes
in a cell supporting non-MBSFN transmission. In case the subframe is used for
transmission with MBSFN, only the first two OFDM symbols in a subframe can be
used for transmission of cell-specific reference symbols.
Cell-specific reference signals are transmitted on one or several of antenna
ports 0 to 3.
Cell-specific reference signals are defined for $\text{Δf} = \text{15}\text{\
kHz}$ only.
#### 6.10.1.1 Sequence generation
The reference-signal sequence $r_{l,n_{s}}(m)$ is defined by
where $n_{s}$ is the slot number within a radio frame and $l$ is the OFDM
symbol number within the slot. The pseudo-random sequence $c(i)$ is defined in
Section 7.2. The pseudo-random sequence generator shall be initialised with
$c_{\text{init}} = 2^{\text{10}} \cdot \left( 7 \cdot \left( n_{s} + 1 \right)
+ l + 1 \right) \cdot \left( 2 \cdot N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} + 1 \right) +
2 \cdot N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} + N_{\text{CP}}$ at the start of each OFDM
symbol where
#### 6.10.1.2 Mapping to resource elements
The reference signal sequence $r_{l,n_{s}}(m)$ shall be mapped to complex-
valued modulation symbols $a_{k,l}^{(p)}$ used as reference symbols for
antenna port $p$ in slot $n_{s}$ according to
where
The variables $v$ and $v_{\text{shift}}$ define the position in the frequency
domain for the different reference signals where $v$ is given by
The cell-specific frequency shift is given by $v_{\text{shift}} =
N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}\text{mod}6$.
Resource elements $\left( k,l \right)$ used for reference signal transmission
on any of the antenna ports in a slot shall not be used for any transmission
on any other antenna port in the same slot and set to zero.
Figures 6.10.1.2-1 and 6.10.1.2-2 illustrate the resource elements used for
reference signal transmission according to the above definition. The notation
$R_{p}$ is used to denote a resource element used for reference signal
transmission on antenna port$p$.
Figure 6.10.1.2-1. Mapping of downlink reference signals (normal cyclic
prefix).
Figure 6.10.1.2-2. Mapping of downlink reference signals (extended cyclic
prefix).
### 6.10.2 MBSFN reference signals
MBSFN reference signals shall only be transmitted in subframes allocated for
MBSFN transmissions. MBSFN reference signals are transmitted on antenna port
4.
MBSFN reference signals are defined for extended cyclic prefix only.
#### 6.10.2.1 Sequence generation
The MBSFN reference-signal sequence$r_{l,n_{s}}(m)$ is defined by
where $n_{s}$ is the slot number within a radio frame and $l$ is the OFDM
symbol number within the slot. The pseudo-random sequence $c(i)$ is defined in
Section 7.2. The pseudo-random sequence generator shall be initialised with
$c_{\text{init}} = 2^{9} \cdot \left( 7 \cdot \left( n_{s} + 1 \right) + l + 1
\right) \cdot \left( 2 \cdot N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{MBSFN}} + 1 \right) +
N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{MBSFN}}$ at the start of each OFDM symbol.
#### 6.10.2.2 Mapping to resource elements
The reference-signal sequence $r_{l,n_{s}}(m^{'})$ in OFDM symbol $l$ shall be
mapped to complex-valued modulation symbols $a_{k,l}^{(p)}$ with $p = 4$
according to
where
Figure 6.10.2.2-1 illustrates the resource elements used for MBSFN reference
signal transmission in case of $\text{Δf} = \text{15}\text{\ kHz}$. In case of
$\text{Δf} = 7\text{.}5\text{\ kHz}$ for a MBSFN-dedicated cell, the MBSFN
reference signal shall be mapped to resource elements according to Figure
6.10.2.2-3. The notation $R_{p}$ is used to denote a resource element used for
reference signal transmission on antenna port$p$.

Figure 6.10.2.2-3: Mapping of MBSFN reference signals (extended cyclic prefix,
$\text{Δf} = 7\text{.}5\text{\ kHz}$)
### 6.10.3 UE-specific reference signals
UE-specific reference signals are supported for single-antenna-port
transmission of PDSCH and are transmitted on antenna port 5. UE specific
reference signals are present and are a valid reference for PDSCH demodulation
only if the PDSCH transmission is associated with the corresponding antenna
port according to Section 7.1 of [4]. UE-specific reference signals are
transmitted only on the resource blocks upon which the corresponding PDSCH is
mapped. The UE-specific reference signal is not transmitted in resource
elements $\left( k,l \right)$ in which one of the physical channels or
physical signals other than UE-specific reference signal defined in 6.1 are
transmitted using resource elements with the same index pair$\left( k,l
\right)$ regardless of their antenna port $p$.
#### 6.10.3.1 Sequence generation
The UE-specific reference-signal sequence $r(m)$ is defined by
where $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PDSCH}}$ denotes the bandwidth in resource blocks
of the corresponding PDSCH transmission.. The pseudo-random sequence $c(i)$ is
defined in Section 7.2. The pseudo-random sequence generator shall be
initialised with $c_{\text{init}} = \left( \left\lfloor n_{s}/2 \right\rfloor
+ 1 \right) \cdot \left( 2N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} + 1 \right) \cdot
2^{\text{16}} + n_{\text{RNTI}}$ at the start of each subframe where
$n_{\text{RNTI}}$ is as described in Section 7.1[4].
#### 6.10.3.2 Mapping to resource elements
In a physical resource block with frequency-domain index $n_{\text{PR}B}$
assigned for the corresponding PDSCH transmission, the reference signal
sequence $r(m)$ shall be mapped to complex-valued modulation symbols
$a_{k,l}^{(p)}$ with $p = 5$ in a subframe according to:
Normal cyclic prefix:
Extended cyclic prefix:
where $m'$ is the counter of UE-specific reference signal resource elements
within a respective OFDM symbol of the PDSCH transmission.
The cell-specific frequency shift is given by $v_{\text{shift}} =
N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}\text{mod}3$.
The mapping shall be in increasing order of the frequency-domain index
$n_{\text{PR}B}$ of the physical resource blocks assigned for the
corresponding PDSCH transmission. The quantity $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PDSCH}}$
denotes the bandwidth in resource blocks of the corresponding PDSCH
transmission.
Figure 6.10.3.2-1 illustrates the resource elements used for UE-specific
reference signals for normal cyclic prefix.
Figure 6.10.3.2-2 illustrates the resource elements used for UE-specific
reference signals for extended cyclic prefix.
The notation $R_{p}$ is used to denote a resource element used for reference
signal transmission on antenna port$p$.

prefix)

## 6.11 Synchronization signals
There are 504 unique physical-layer cell identities. The physical-layer cell
identities are grouped into 168 unique physical-layer cell-identity groups,
each group containing three unique identities. The grouping is such that each
physical-layer cell identity is part of one and only one physical-layer cell-
identity group. A physical-layer cell identity $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} =
3N_{\text{ID}}^{(1)} + N_{\text{ID}}^{(2)}$is thus uniquely defined by a
number$N_{\text{ID}}^{(1)}$in the range of 0 to 167, representing the
physical-layer cell-identity group, and a number$N_{\text{ID}}^{(2)}$ in the
range of 0 to 2, representing the physical-layer identity within the physical-
layer cell-identity group.
### 6.11.1 Primary synchronization signal
#### 6.11.1.1 Sequence generation
The sequence $d(n)$ used for the primary synchronization signal is generated
from a frequency-domain Zadoff-Chu sequence according to
where the Zadoff-Chu root sequence index $u$ is given by Table 6.11.1.1-1.
Table 6.11.1.1-1: Root indices for the primary synchronization signal.
* * *
      Root index $u$
0 25 1 29 2 34
* * *
#### 6.11.1.2 Mapping to resource elements
The mapping of the sequence to resource elements depends on the frame
structure. The UE shall not assume that the primary synchronization signal is
transmitted on the same antenna port as any of the downlink reference signals.
The UE shall not assume that any transmission instance of the primary
synchronization signal is transmitted on the same antenna port, or ports, used
for any other transmission instance of the primary synchronization signal.
The sequence $d\left( n \right)$ shall be mapped to the resource elements
according to
For frame structure type 1, the primary synchronization signal shall be mapped
to the last OFDM symbol in slots 0 and 10.
For frame structure type 2, the primary synchronization signal shall be mapped
to the third OFDM symbol in subframes 1 and 6. Resource elements $(k,l)$ in
the OFDM symbols used for transmission of the primary synchronization signal
where
are reserved and not used for transmission of the primary synchronization
signal.
### 6.11.2 Secondary synchronization signal
#### 6.11.2.1 Sequence generation
The sequence $d(0),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d(\text{61})$used for the second
synchronization signal is an interleaved concatenation of two length-31 binary
sequences. The concatenated sequence is scrambled with a scrambling sequence
given by the primary synchronization signal.
The combination of two length-31 sequences defining the secondary
synchronization signal differs between subframe 0 and subframe 5 according to
where $0 \leq n \leq \text{30}$. The indices $m_{0}$ and $m_{1}$ are derived
from the physical-layer cell-identity group $N_{\text{ID}}^{(1)}$ according to
where the output of the above expression is listed in Table 6.11.2.1-1.
The two sequences $s_{0}^{(m_{0})}(n)$ and $s_{1}^{(m_{1})}(n)$ are defined as
two different cyclic shifts of the m-sequence $\overset{\sim}{s}(n)$ according
to
where$\overset{\sim}{s}(i) = 1 - 2x(i)$, $0 \leq i \leq \text{30}$, is defined
by
with initial conditions$\begin{matrix} x(0) = 0, & x(1) = 0, & x(2) = 0, &
x(3) = 0, & x(4) = 1 \ \end{matrix}$.
The two scrambling sequences $c_{0}(n)$ and $c_{1}(n)$ depend on the primary
synchronization signal and are defined by two different cyclic shifts of the
m-sequence $\overset{\sim}{c}(n)$ according to
where $N_{\text{ID}}^{(2)} \in \left{ 0,1,2 \right}$ is the physical-layer
identity within the physical-layer cell identity group $N_{\text{ID}}^{(1)}$
and $\overset{\sim}{c}(i) = 1 - 2x(i)$, $0 \leq i \leq \text{30}$, is defined
by
with initial conditions $\begin{matrix} x(0) = 0, & x(1) = 0, & x(2) = 0, &
x(3) = 0, & x(4) = 1 \ \end{matrix}$.
The scrambling sequences $z_{1}^{(m_{0})}(n)$ and $z_{1}^{(m_{1})}(n)$ are
defined by a cyclic shift of the m-sequence $\overset{\sim}{z}(n)$ according
to
where $m_{0}$ and $m_{1}$ are obtained from Table 6.11.2.1-1 and
$\overset{\sim}{z}(i) = 1 - 2x(i)$, $0 \leq i \leq \text{30}$, is defined by
with initial conditions $\begin{matrix} x(0) = 0, & x(1) = 0, & x(2) = 0, &
x(3) = 0, & x(4) = 1 \ \end{matrix}$.

#### 6.11.2.2 Mapping to resource elements
The mapping of the sequence to resource elements depends on the frame
structure. In a subframe for frame structure type 1 and in a half-frame for
frame structure type 2, the same antenna port as for the primary
synchronization signal shall be used for the secondary synchronization signal.
The sequence $d\left( n \right)$ shall be mapped to resource elements
according to
Resource elements $(k,l)$ where
are reserved and not used for transmission of the secondary synchronization
signal.
## 6.12 OFDM baseband signal generation
The time-continuous signal $s_{l}^{(p)}\left( t \right)$ on antenna port $p$
in OFDM symbol $l$ in a downlink slot is defined by
for $0 \leq t  0$starts at time
$\sum_{}^{}{(N_{\text{CP},l^{'}} + N)T_{s}}$ within the slot. In case the
first OFDM symbol(s) in a slot use normal cyclic prefix and the remaining OFDM
symbols use extended cyclic prefix, the starting position the OFDM symbols
with extended cyclic prefix shall be identical to those in a slot where all
OFDM symbols use extended cyclic prefix. Thus there will be a part of the time
slot between the two cyclic prefix regions where the transmitted signal is not
specified.
Table 6.12-1 lists the value of $N_{\text{CP},l}$that shall be used. Note that
different OFDM symbols within a slot in some cases have different cyclic
prefix lengths.

## 6.13 Modulation and upconversion
Modulation and upconversion to the carrier frequency of the complex-valued
OFDM baseband signal for each antenna port is shown in Figure 6.13-1. The
filtering required prior to transmission is defined by the requirements in
[6].

# 7 Generic functions
## 7.1 Modulation mapper
The modulation mapper takes binary digits, 0 or 1, as input and produces
complex-valued modulation symbols, _x=I+jQ_ , as output.
## 7.1.1 BPSK
In case of BPSK modulation, a single bit, $b(i)$, is mapped to a complex-
valued modulation symbol _x_ =_I_ +j _Q_ according to Table 7.1.1-1.

## 7.2 Pseudo-random sequence generation
Pseudo-random sequences are defined by a length-31 Gold sequence. The output
sequence $c(n)$ of length$M_{\text{PN}}$, where$n =
0,1,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},M_{\text{PN}} - 1$, is defined by
where $N_{C} = \text{1600}$and the first m-sequence shall be initialized
with$x_{1}(0) = 1,x_{1}(n) = 0,n = 1,2,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\text{30}$.
The initialization of the second m-sequence is denoted by $c_{\text{init}} =
\sum_{}^{}{x_{2}(i) \cdot 2^{i}}$ with the value depending on the application
of the sequence.
# 8 Timing
## 8.1 Uplink-downlink frame timing
Transmission of the uplink radio frame number $i$ from the UE shall start
$(N_{\text{TA}} + N_{\text{TA\ offset}}) \times T_{s}$ seconds before the
start of the corresponding downlink radio frame at the UE, where 0 ≤ _N~TA~_ ≤
20512, $N_{\text{TA\ offset}} = 0$for frame structure type 1 and $N_{\text{TA\
offset}} = \text{624}$ for frame structure type 2. Note that not all slots in
a radio frame may be transmitted. One example hereof is TDD, where only a
subset of the slots in a radio frame is transmitted.
