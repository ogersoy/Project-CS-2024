# Introduction
User Equipment (UE) Test Loop functionality is a mandatory feature to support
E-UTRA / EPC conformance testing. It forms part of the core requirements and
thus has a direct impact on the design of the UE.
The test methods applied in RF Conformance Test Specification TS 36.521-1 [27]
and the test models used in Protocol Conformance Test Specifications TS
36.523-1 [30] and TS 36.523-3 [32] define the corresponding UE Test Loop
functionality. The present specification describes the location of the data
loop in the protocol stack as well as the procedure and specific messages to
activate/deactivate the Test Loop functionality in the UE.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines for User Equipment (UE) in E-UTRA FDD or TDD mode
those special functions and their activation/deactivation methods that are
required in UE for conformance testing purposes.
This document also describes the operation of these special functions for UEs
supporting E-UTRA FDD or TDD mode, when operating in UTRA FDD and TDD mode, in
GSM/GPRS mode, and in CDMA2000 mode.

# 4 UE special conformance test functions
## 4.1 General description
The SS performs activation and deactivation of the conformance test functions
in the UE by sending Security Protected NAS Layer 3 messages. Apart from
sending the appropriate deactivation command to the UE the functions shall be
deactivated by:
switching off the UE; or
by removing the USIM.
The following special UE conformance testing functions can be activated (and
deactivated):
\- UE test loop function;
\- Electrical Man Machine Interface (EMMI).
The following Test Control (TC) procedures are used to control the UE test
loop function:
\- Close UE test loop;
\- Open UE test loop.
No specific TC procedures are associated with EMMI.
# 5 Test Control (TC) protocol procedures and test loop operation
## 5.1 General description
The UE test loop function provides access to isolated functions of the UE via
the radio interface without introducing new physical interfaces just for the
reason of conformance testing.
NOTE: It should be emphasised that the UE test loop function only describes
the functional behaviour of the UE with respect to its external interfaces;
physical implementation of the UE test loop function is completely left open
to the manufacturer.
The UE test loop function is activated by transmitting the appropriate TC
message to the UE, see clause 6.
The UE test loop function can be operated in two different loopback modes:
\- UE test loop mode A; and
\- UE test loop mode B.
UE test loop mode A provides loopback of PDCP SDUs for bi-directional data
radio bearers while UE is operating in E-UTRA mode. The downlink PDCP SDUs
received by the UE on each bi-directional data radio bearer are returned on
the same radio bearer regardless of the PDCP SDU contents and of the TFT of
the associated EPS bearer context [36].
UE test loop mode B provides loopback of PDCP SDUs (E-UTRA and UTRA), SNDCP
PDUs (GSM/GPRS) and RLP PDUs (CDMA2000) for bi-directional EPS bearers while
UE is operated in E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/GPRS or CDMA2000 modes. UE test loop mode
B can not be used when more than one PDN connection is established or more
than one primary PDP context is active. When operating in E-UTRA, the downlink
PDCP SDUs received by the UE on all bi-directional data radio bearers are
returned by the UE on the data radio bearer associated with an EPS bearer
context with a TFT matching the TCP/UDP/IP protocol information within the
PDCP SDU [36]. When operating in UTRA, GSM/GPRS or CDMA2000 modes, the
downlink PDCP SDUs received by the UE on all bi-directional data radio bearers
are returned by the UE on the data radio bearer with the smallest identity,
regardless of the PDCP SDU contents and of the TFT of the associated EPS
bearer context.
UE test loop mode A is mandatory to all E-UTRA UEs.
UE test loop mode B for operation in E-UTRA mode is mandatory to all E-UTRA
UEs.
UE test loop mode B for operation in UTRA mode is mandatory to all E-UTRA UEs
supporting UTRA radio access.
UE test loop mode B for operation in GSM/GPRS mode is mandatory to all E-UTRA
UEs supporting GSM/GPRS radio access.
UE test loop mode B for operation in CDMA2000 mode is mandatory to all E-UTRA
UEs supporting CDMA2000 radio access.
For E-UTRA UE supporting multiple radio access technologies then UE reception
of Test Control messages is limited to UE operating in E-UTRA mode, while
continuation of loopback of user data is provided over the change to other UE
supported radio access technologies.
UE test loop mode B for operation in UTRA, GSM/GPRS and CDMA2000 mode is only
applicable for loopback of user data in PS domain.
The TC entity may be seen as a L3 or a NAS entity.
Figure 5.1-1 shows a functional block diagram of UE test loop function for TC
entity and UE test loop mode A. The loopback of PDCP SDUs for UE test loop
mode A is specified in sub clause 5.3.3.
Figure 5.1-2 shows a functional block diagram of UE test loop function for TC
entity and UE test loop mode B. The loopback of IP PDUs/PDCP SDUs for UE test
loop mode B and UE in E-UTRA mode is specified in subclauses 5.3.4.2 and
5.3.4.3.
Figure 5.1-3 shows a functional block diagram of UE test loop function for UE
test loop mode B and UE operating in UTRA mode. The loopback of IP PDUs/PDCP
SDUs for UE test loop mode B and UE in UTRA mode is specified in subclauses
5.3.4.4 and 5.3.4.5.
Figure 5.1-4 shows a functional block diagram of UE test loop function for UE
test loop mode B for UE operating in GSM/GPRS mode. The loopback of IP
PDUs/SNDCP SDUs for UE test loop mode B and UE in GSM/GPRS mode is specified
in subclauses 5.3.4.6 and 5.3.4.7.
Figure 5.1-5 shows a functional block diagram of UE test loop function for UE
test loop mode B for UE operating in CDMA2000 mode. The loopback of IP
PDUs/RLP SDUs for UE test loop mode B and UE in CDMA2000 mode is specified in
subclauses 5.3.4.8 and 5.3.4.9.
NOTE: ROHC functionality in PDCP Layer 2 is optional for UE implementations.

## 5.2 Security protection of test control messages
The test control messages, i.e. ACTIVATE TEST MODE, DEACTIVATE TEST MODE,
CLOSE UE TEST LOOP, and OPEN UE TEST LOOP, are integrity protected and
ciphered according to TS 24.301 clause 4.4.
## 5.3 UE test mode procedures
### 5.3.1 General
The UE test mode procedures are intended for setting the UE into a test mode
where the SS can set up data radio bearers (UE test loop mode A) or EPS
bearers (UE test loop mode B) to be terminated in the UE test loop function;
as well as, for making UE leave the test mode if it has previously been set
into it and return to normal operation.
### 5.3.2 Activate UE test mode
Figure 5.3.2-1: Activate UE test mode procedure
#### 5.3.2.1 General
The SS uses the activate UE test mode procedure to get the UE into a test mode
where the SS can set up one or more sets of data radio bearers with an
associated EPS bearer context (UE test loop mode A) or EPS bearers (UE test
loop mode B) before commanding the UE to terminate them in the UE test loop
function. The activation of the UE test loop function in UE test loop mode A
or UE test loop mode B will control if the UE is terminating the data radio
bearers or the EPS bearers in the UE test loop function.
#### 5.3.2.2 Initiation
The SS can activate the UE test mode when UE is in E-UTRA connected state.
NOTE: Refer to TS 36.508 [28] subclause 4.5.1 for more details on UE states.
The SS requests the UE to activate the UE test mode by transmitting an
ACTIVATE TEST MODE message.
#### 5.3.2.3 Reception of ACTIVATE TEST MODE message by UE
Upon receiving the ACTIVATE TEST MODE message the UE shall:
1> if a default EPS bearer context is already activated:
2> the UE behaviour is unspecified.
  1. else:
2> activate the UE test mode;
2> send ACTIVATE TEST MODE COMPLETE message.
When the UE test mode is active:
1> the UE shall accept any request to establish a data radio bearer with an
associated EPS bearer context, both included in the same RRC message, and
within the radio access capabilities of the UE;
1> if neither test loop mode A operation nor test loop mode B operation is
ongoing:
2> if the UE is operating in E-UTRAN mode:
3> if the UE hasn\'t received the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message in response to the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message included in an
ATTACH REQUEST message; or
3> if the UE has received the response message with the PDN type IE set to
\'IPv4\' and an IPv4 address value different from \'0.0.0.0\':
4> the UE may not transmit any uplink PDCP SDU on any DRB:
4> the UE may discard any received downlink PDCP SDU on any DRB is.
NOTE: If the UE has requested the use of DHCPv4 signalling for allocation of
an IPv4 address, the UE may either accept the IPv4 address provided via NAS
signalling and may not transmit any uplink PDCP SDU on any DRB and may discard
downlink PDCP SDUs on any DRB, or the UE may transmit and receive DHCPv4
messages to obtain an IPv4 address, according to the procedure described in TS
36.508 clause 4.5.2A.
3> if the UE has received the response message with the PDN type IE set to a
value different from \'IPv4\' or with the IPv4 address equal to \'0.0.0.0\';
4> the UE may transmit uplink PDCP SDUs on any DRB.
### 5.3.3 Deactivate UE test mode
Figure 5.3.3-1: Deactivate UE test mode procedure
#### 5.3.3.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to deactivate the UE test mode and return UE
to normal operation.
NOTE: Deactivation of the UE test loop mode may occur as well as a result of
other events. For further details see e.g. 4.1, 5.4.2.1.
#### 5.3.3.2 Initiation
The SS can deactivate the UE test mode when UE is in E-UTRA connected state
and the UE test mode is active.
NOTE: Refer to TS 36.508 [28] subclause 4.5.1 for more details on UE states.
The SS requests the UE to deactivate the UE test mode by transmitting a
DEACTIVATE TEST MODE message.
#### 5.3.3.3 Reception of DEACTIVATE TEST MODE message by UE
Upon receiving the DEACTIVATE TEST MODE message the UE shall:
1> deactivate the UE test mode;
1> send a DEACTIVATE TEST MODE COMPLETE message.
## 5.4 UE test loop procedures
### 5.4.1 General
The UE test loop function is intended for:
\- E-UTRA RF receiver and transmitter testing to generate data transfer in
downlink and uplink.
\- E-UTRA layer 2 (MAC, RLC, PDCP) and data radio bearer testing to generate
data transfer in downlink and uplink.
\- EPC and E-UTRA layer 3 testing to verify data transfer continuation over
RRC and EPC procedures.
\- EPC NAS user-plane testing to verify uplink TFT handling.
\- E-UTRA/EPC Inter-system testing to verify data transfer continuation over
Inter-system change procedures to and from UTRA, GSM/GPRS and CDMA2000.
### 5.4.2 Close UE test loop
{width="3.7402777777777776in" height="1.6465277777777778in"}
Figure 5.4.2-1: Close UE test loop procedure
#### 5.4.2.1 General
The SS uses the close UE test loop procedure to start the UE Test Loop
function in the UE while in E-UTRA mode.
A prerequisite for UE test loop mode A is that at least one bi-directional
data radio bearer has been established between SS and UE.
A prerequisite for UE test loop mode B is that at least one EPS bearer context
has been established between SS and UE.
The UE shall provide for normal layer 1, layer 2, RRC, EMM and ESM
functionality while the UE test loop function is active. This includes (but is
not limited to) handover procedures and normal disconnection of the data radio
bearer.
For UE test loop mode A the loopback shall be maintained across handovers
within E-UTRA, but after data radio bearer release, the loopback shall cease
to exist.
For UE test loop mode B the loopback shall be maintained across handovers
within E-UTRA and between radio access system (E-UTRA to/from UTRA, E-UTRA
to/from GSM/GPRS and E-UTRA to/from CDMA2000). This means that any buffered IP
PDUs in the UE test loop function at the time of the intra- or inter-system
change shall be kept in the UE test loop function and being scheduled for
transmission transparently to the intra- or inter-system change.
For UE test loop mode A or B, UE shall not transmit any uplink U-plane data
other than the data returned by the loopback entity.
#### 5.4.2.1a UE test loop mode A PDCP SDU and UE test loop mode B IP PDU
buffer size requirement
The minimum UE loopback buffer size for PDCP SDUs (UE test loop mode A) and IP
PDUs (UE test loop mode B), when UE is operated in RLC AM or UM mode, shall be
according to table 5.4.2.1a-1. The UE behaviour, when the loopback buffer
capacity is exceeded, is unspecified.
Table 5.4.2.1a-1: Minimum loopback buffer size for different UE categories
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+ | UE Category | Minimum loopback buffer size | | | | | | [byte] | | | | | | (note 1) | +--------------------------------------+------------------------------+ | Category 1 | 60000 | +--------------------------------------+------------------------------+ | Category 2 | 60000 | +--------------------------------------+------------------------------+ | Category 3 | 60000 | +--------------------------------------+------------------------------+ | Category 4 | 60000 | +--------------------------------------+------------------------------+ | Category 5 | 60000 | +--------------------------------------+------------------------------+ | Note 1: Minimum loopback buffer size | | | has been selected 1) for each UE | | | category such that the UE shall be | | | able to forward all data received in | | | one TTI when the applicable maximum | | | transport block size of the UE is | | | used, and 2) to allow execution of | | | MAC test case 7,1.4.3 in TS 36.523-1 | | | [30], which requires a minimum | | | loopback buffer size of 56922 bytes | | | for all UE categories. | | +--------------------------------------+------------------------------+
#### 5.4.2.2 Initiation
The SS can request the UE to close a test loop in mode A if at least one bi-
directional data radio bearer is established and the UE test mode is active.
The SS can request the UE to close a test loop in mode B if at least one EPS
bearer is established and the UE test mode is active.
The SS requests the UE to close its UE test loop mode A or UE test loop mode B
test loop(s) by transmitting a CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message.
#### 5.4.2.3 Reception of CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message by the UE
Upon receiving the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message the UE shall:
1> if UE test loop mode A has been selected;
2> if no bi-directional data radio bearers are established or if the UE test
mode is not active; or
2> if test loop mode A or test loop mode B operation is already closed on one
or more data radio bearers:
3> the UE behaviour is unspecified
2> else:
3> for LB_ID=0 to MAX_ModeA_LB-1_entities:
4> set DRB_ID(LB_ID) to 0 (indicate no DRB mapped)
4> set UL_PDCP_SDU_scaling(LB_ID) to FALSE
3> set LB_ID to 0
3> for each established bi-directional data radio bearer in ascending order
and starting with the data radio bearer with the lowest configured Data Radio
bearer identity number:
4> if LB_ID is less than MAX_ModeA_LB_entities:
5> set DRB_ID(LB_ID) to the Data Radio bearer identity number
5> increment LB_ID by 1
4> else:
5> the UE behaviour is unspecified
3> if the UE test loop mode A setup IE is included:
4> for each LB Setup DRB IE in the LB setup list of the UE test loop mode A
setup IE:
5> for LB_ID=0 to MAX_ModeA_LB_entities-1:
> 6> if DRB_ID(LB_ID) is equal to the Data Radio bearer identity number
> parameter of the LB Setup DRB IE:
>
> 7> if the LB Setup DRB(LB_ID) IE is included:
>
> 7> set UL_PDCP_SDU_scaling(LB_ID) to TRUE
>
> 7> set UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID) to UL PDCP SDU size parameter of the LB Setup
> DRB(LB_ID) IE
3> perform the UE actions for UE Test Loop Mode A operation as specified in
subclause 5.4.3; and
3> send CLOSE UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message (the loopback shall be operational
prior to the sending of the acknowledgement).
1> else if UE test loop mode B has been selected;
2> if no EPS bearer is established or if the UE test mode is not active; or
2> if the test loop is already active on one or more EPS bearers:
3> the UE behaviour is unspecified.
2> otherwise:
3> set TEST_LOOP_MODE_B_ACTIVE to TRUE
3> set timer T_delay_modeB to the value of IP PDU delay timer parameter of the
UE test loop mode B IE;
3> if the IP PDU delay timer parameter of the UE test loop mode B IE has a
value larger than zero:
4> set BUFFER_IP_PDUs to TRUE
3> else:
4> set BUFFER_IP_PDUs to FALSE
3> set CDMA2000_INITIATED to FALSE
3> perform the UE actions for UE Test Loop Mode B operation as specified in
subclause 5.4.4 and 5.4.4.1 to 5.4.4.11; and
3> send CLOSE UE TEST LOOP COMPLETE message (the loopback shall be operational
prior to the sending of the acknowledgement).
1> else;
2> the UE behaviour is unspecified.
### 5.4.3 UE test loop mode A operation
Upon receiving a PDCP SDU identified by LB_ID when operating in E-UTRA mode
with UE Test Loop Mode A active the UE shall:
1> if UL_PDCP_SDU_scaling(LB_ID) is FALSE:
2> take the PDCP SDU from the output of the PDCP Service Access Point (SAP)
and provide it as input to the correspondent PDCP SAP in uplink and transmit,
see Figure 5.4.3-1.
1> else:
2> if UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID) = 0:
3> discard the PDCP SDU (no data is returned).
2> else:
3> if the size of the received PDCP SDU in downlink is equal to
UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID):
4> take the PDCP SDU from the output of the PDCP SAP and provide it as input
to the correspondent PDCP SAP in uplink and transmit, see Figure 5.4.3-1.
3>else if the size of the received PDCP SDU in downlink is bigger than
UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID):
4> create a UL PDCP SDU of size UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID) by taking the first K
bits of the received PDCP SDU in downlink PDCP SAP, where K is equal to
UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID) and provide it as input to the correspondent PDCP SAP
in uplink and transmit, see Figure 5.4.3-2.
3> else if the size of the received PDCP SDU in downlink is less than
UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID):
4> create a UL PDCP SDU of size UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID) by repeating the data
received in downlink PDCP SDU in downlink to fill the UL PDCP SDU (truncating
the last block if necessary), provide it as input to the correspondent PDCP
SAP in uplink and transmit, see Figure 5.4.3-3.
Note: Size of the received PDCP SDUs in downlink shall be bit strings that are
byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) according to TS 36.323 [24] clause
6.2.1.

Editor's note: It is FFS if procedure for reset of UE positioning stored
information will be included.
# 7 Variables, constants and timers
## 7.1 State variables
BUFFER_IP_PDUs
This boolean state variable is used to control if UE is to buffer IP PDUs or
not.
TEST_LOOP_MODE_B_ACTIVE
This boolean state variable is used to indicate if UE test loop mode B is
active. TEST_LOOP_MODE_B_ACTIVE shall be set to FALSE when UE is switched on.
CDMA2000_INITIATED
This boolean state variable is used to indicate if IP control signalling was
initiated by the network on CDMA2000.
## 7.2 Constants
MAX_ModeA_LB_entities = 8.
## 7.3 Timers
T_delay_modeB
In E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN, this timer is used to delay the transmission of
the first IP PDU when UE test loop function is operated in UE test loop mode
B. In CDMA2000, this timer is used to temporarily interrupt UE test loop mode
B operation so as to allow IP control signalling required before data
transmission. The timer value is configured by the UE test loop mode B setup
IE in the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message.
## 7.4 Configurable parameters
DRB_ID(LB_ID)
This parameter is used by the UE when operating in UE test loop mode A to map
a bi-directional Data Radio bearer to a loopback entity. LB_ID = 0..
(MAX_ModeA_LB_entities-1). The value is configured when UE receives the CLOSE
UE TEST LOOP message DRB_ID(LB_ID)=0 indicate that no DRB is mapped to the
loopback identity.
UL_PDCP_SDU_scaling(LB_ID)
This parameter is used to enable/disable scaling of UL PDCP SDU size. If
UL_PDCP_SDU_scaling is set to TRUE then scaling based on
UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID) parameter is performed, otherwise no scaling is done
(UL PDCP SDU size is equal to received DL PDCP SDU size). The value is
configured by the UE test loop mode A setup IE in the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP
message.
UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID)
This parameter is used to set the UL PDCP SDU size for returned UL PDCP SDUs
on the data radio bearer with data radio bearer ID equal to DRB_ID(LB_ID).
This parameter is only applicable for UE test loop mode A and when state
variable UL_PDCP_SDU_scaling(LB_ID) is TRUE. The value is configured by the UE
test loop mode A setup IE in the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message.
# 8 Electrical Man Machine Interface (EMMI)
The EMMI is used for automation of conformance testing. The commands used on
the EMMI by the System Simulator, shall be limited to those specified in TS
36.523-3 [32]. An illustration is given in figure 8-1 as an example.
At the System Simulator side, the logical EMMI using mandatory AT commands
shall interface with the Main Test Component (MTC) of TTCN test cases which
hosts the Upper Tester. The physical EMMI interface towards the UE may be for
example a standard USB interface. Other interfaces of proprietary or
standardized type shall not be precluded.
At the UE side an adapter needs to be provided by the UE manufacturer for
converting the commands into the UE manufacturer specific interface and
format.
The use of EMMI is optional for the UE.
