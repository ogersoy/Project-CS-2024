# 4 UE radio access capability parameters
The following subclauses define the UE radio access capability parameters.
Only parameters for which there is the possibility for UEs to signal different
values are considered as UE radio access capability parameters. Therefore,
mandatory capabilities that are the same for all UEs are not listed here. Also
capabilities which are optional for UEs to implement but do not have UE radio
access capability parameter are listed in this specification.
E-UTRAN needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability parameters
when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.
All parameters shown in italics are signalled and correspond to a field
defined in TS 36.331 [5].
## 4.1 _ue-Category_
The field _ue-Category_ defines a combined uplink and downlink capability. The
parameters set by the UE Category are defined in subclause 4.2. Tables 4.1-1
and 4.1-2 define the downlink and, respectively, uplink physical layer
parameter values for each UE Category.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Guideline on maximum number of DL PDCP SDUs
per TTI
In order to help the dimensioning of the UE design, values for the maximum
number of DL PDCP SDUs per TTI from Table A-1 may be used.
Note: Due to the need for the network buffer data for efficient scheduling,
values for Category 1 and 2 are same. It is not expected that category 1 UE
has to sustain the same rate of PDCP SDUs per TTI as category 2 for prolonged
period of time.
Table A-1: Maximum values for DL PDCP SDUs per TTI
* * *
UE Category Maximum number of PDCP SDUs per TTI Category 1 10 Category 2 10
Category 3 20 Category 4 30 Category 5 50
