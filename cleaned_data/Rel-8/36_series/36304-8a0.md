# 4 General description of Idle mode
## 4.1 Overview
The idle mode tasks can be subdivided into four processes:
\- PLMN selection;
\- Cell selection and reselection;
\- Location registration;
\- Support for manual CSG selection.
The relationship between these processes is illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 4.1-1: Overall Idle Mode process
When a UE is switched on, a public land mobile network (PLMN) is selected by
NAS. For the selected PLMN, associated RAT(s) may be set [5]. The NAS shall
provide a list of equivalent PLMNs, if available, that the AS shall use for
cell selection and cell reselection.
With the cell selection, the UE searches for a suitable cell of the selected
PLMN and chooses that cell to provide available services, further the UE shall
tune to its control channel. This choosing is known as \"camping on the
cell\".
The UE shall, if necessary, then register its presence, by means of a NAS
registration procedure, in the tracking area of the chosen cell and as outcome
of a successful Location Registration the selected PLMN becomes the registered
PLMN [5].
If the UE finds a more suitable cell, according to the cell reselection
criteria, it reselects onto that cell and camps on it. If the new cell does
not belong to at least one tracking area to which the UE is registered,
location registration is performed.
If necessary, the UE shall search for higher priority PLMNs at regular time
intervals as described in [4] and search for a suitable cell if another PLMN
has been selected by NAS.
Search of available CSGs may be triggered by NAS to support manual CSG
selection within the registered PLMN.
If the UE loses coverage of the registered PLMN, either a new PLMN is selected
automatically (automatic mode), or an indication of which PLMNs are available
is given to the user, so that a manual selection can be made (manual mode).
Registration is not performed by UEs only capable of services that need no
registration.
The purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode is fourfold:
a) It enables the UE to receive system information from the PLMN.
b) When registered and if the UE wishes to establish an RRC connection, it can
do this by initially accessing the network on the control channel of the cell
on which it is camped.
c) If the PLMN receives a call for the registered UE, it knows (in most cases)
the set of tracking areas in which the UE is camped. It can then send a
\"paging\" message for the UE on the control channels of all the cells in this
set of tracking areas. The UE will then receive the paging message because it
is tuned to the control channel of a cell in one of the registered tracking
areas and the UE can respond on that control channel.
d) It enables the UE to receive ETWS notifications.
If the UE is unable to find a suitable cell to camp on or if the location
registration failed (except for LR rejected with cause #12, cause #14, cause
#15 or cause #25, see [5] and [16]), it attempts to camp on a cell
irrespective of the PLMN identity, and enters a \"limited service\" state in
which it can only attempt to make emergency calls.
A UE which is not equipped with a valid USIM (i.e. no UICC or SIM only), or
which shall consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services as defined in [16]
and [20] (e.g. due to a LR reject #3, #6, #7, #8) shall disable all its
E-UTRAN capabilities until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is
removed.
NOTE: This is because Rel-8 E-UTRAN/EPC does not support USIM-less emergency
calls.
## 4.2 Functional division between AS and NAS in Idle mode
Table 1 presents the functional division between UE non-access stratum (NAS)
and UE access stratum (AS) in idle mode. The NAS part is specified in [5] and
the AS part in the present document.

Table 4.2-1: Functional division between AS and NAS in idle mode
## 4.3 Service types in Idle Mode
This clause defines the level of service that may be provided by the network
to a UE in Idle mode.
The action of camping on a cell is necessary to get access to some services.
Three levels of services are defined for UE:
\- Limited service (emergency calls and ETWS on an acceptable cell)
\- Normal service (for public use on a suitable cell)
\- Operator service (for operators only on a reserved cell)
Furthermore, the cells are categorised according to which services they offer:
**[acceptable cell:]{.underline}**
An \"acceptable cell\" is a cell on which the UE may camp to obtain limited
service (originate emergency calls and receive ETWS notifications). Such a
cell shall fulfil the following requirements, which is the minimum set of
requirements to initiate an emergency call and to receive ETWS notification in
a E-UTRAN network:
\- The cell is not barred, see subclause 5.3.1;
\- The cell selection criteria are fulfilled, see subclause 5.2.3.2;
**[suitable cell:]{.underline}**
A \"suitable cell\" is a cell on which the UE may camp on to obtain normal
service. Such a cell shall fulfil all the following requirements.
  * The cell is part of either:
```{=html}
``` \- the selected PLMN, or:
  * the registered PLMN, or:
  * a PLMN of the Equivalent PLMN list
\- For a CSG cell, the CSG ID broadcast by the cell is present in the allowed
CSG list associated with the PLMN for which the above condition is satisfied;
According to the latest information provided by NAS:
\- The cell is not barred, see subclause 5.3.1;
\- The cell is part of at least one TA that is not part of the list of
\"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" [4], which belongs to a PLMN that
fulfils the first bullet above;
\- The cell selection criteria are fulfilled, see subclause 5.2.3.2;
If more than one PLMN identity is broadcast in the cell, the cell is
considered to be part of all TAs with TAIs constructed from the PLMN
identities and the TAC broadcast in the cell.
**[barred cell:]{.underline}**
A cell is barred if it is so indicated in the system information [3].
**[reserved cell:]{.underline}**
A cell is reserved if it is so indicated in system information [3].
Following exceptions to these definitions are applicable for UEs:
\- camped on a cell that belongs to a registration area that is forbidden for
regional provision of service; a cell that belongs to a registration area that
is forbidden for regional provision service ([5], [16]) is suitable but
provides only limited service.
\- as an outcome of the manual CSG ID selection procedure the UE is allowed to
access an acceptable cell which fulfils the cell selection criteria and is not
barred or reserved for operator use for UEs not belonging to AC 11 or 15 and
inform NAS that access is possible (for location registration procedure).
NOTE: UE is not required to support manual search and selection of PLMN or CSG
IDs while in RRC CONNECTED state. The UE may use local release of RRC
connection to perform manual search if it is not possible to perform the
search while RRC connected.
# 5 Process and procedure descriptions
## 5.1 PLMN selection
In the UE, the AS shall report available PLMNs to the NAS on request from the
NAS or autonomously.
During PLMN selection, based on the list of PLMN identities in priority order,
the particular PLMN may be selected either automatically or manually. Each
PLMN in the list of PLMN identities is identified by a \'PLMN identity\'. In
the system information on the broadcast channel, the UE can receive one or
multiple \'PLMN identity\' in a given cell. The result of the PLMN selection
performed by NAS (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [5]) is an identifier of the selected
PLMN.
### 5.1.1 Void
### 5.1.2 Support for PLMN selection
#### 5.1.2.1 General
On request of the NAS the AS shall perform a search for available PLMNs and
report them to NAS.
#### 5.1.2.2 E-UTRA case
The UE shall scan all RF channels in the E-UTRA bands according to its
capabilities to find available PLMNs. On each carrier, the UE shall search for
the strongest cell and read its system information, in order to find out which
PLMN(s) the cell belongs to. If the UE can read one or several PLMN identities
in the strongest cell, each found PLMN (see the PLMN reading in [3]) shall be
reported to the NAS as a high quality PLMN (but without the RSRP value),
provided that the following high quality criterion is fulfilled:
1\. For an E-UTRAN cell, the measured RSRP value shall be greater than or
equal to -110 dBm.
Found PLMNs that do not satisfy the high quality criterion, but for which the
UE has been able to read the PLMN identities are reported to the NAS together
with the RSRP value. The quality measure reported by the UE to NAS shall be
the same for each PLMN found in one cell.
The search for PLMNs may be stopped on request of the NAS. The UE may optimise
PLMN search by using stored information e.g. carrier frequencies and
optionally also information on cell parameters from previously received
measurement control information elements.
Once the UE has selected a PLMN, the cell selection procedure shall be
performed in order to select a suitable cell of that PLMN to camp on.
#### 5.1.2.3 UTRA case
Support for PLMN selection in UTRA is described in [8].
#### 5.1.2.4 GSM case
Support for PLMN selection in GERAN is described in [9].
#### 5.1.2.5 CDMA2000 case
For CDMA2000 the network determination for HRPD and 1xRTT is described in [17]
and [18] respectively.
## 5.2 Cell selection and reselection
### 5.2.1 Introduction
UE shall perform measurements for cell selection and reselection purposes as
specified in [10].
The NAS can control the RAT(s) in which the cell selection should be
performed, for instance by indicating RAT(s) associated with the selected
PLMN, and by maintaining a list of forbidden registration area(s) and a list
of equivalent PLMNs. The UE shall select a suitable cell based on idle mode
measurements and cell selection criteria.
In order to speed up the cell selection process, stored information for
several RATs may be available in the UE.
When camped on a cell, the UE shall regularly search for a better cell
according to the cell reselection criteria. If a better cell is found, that
cell is selected. The change of cell may imply a change of RAT. Details on
performance requirements for cell reselection can be found in [10].
The NAS is informed if the cell selection and reselection results in changes
in the received system information relevant for NAS.
For normal service, the UE shall camp on a suitable cell, tune to that cell\'s
control channel(s) so that the UE can:
\- Receive system information from the PLMN; and
\- receive registration area information from the PLMN, e.g., tracking area
information; and
\- receive other AS and NAS Information; and
\- if registered:
\- receive paging and notification messages from the PLMN; and
\- initiate transfer to connected mode.
### 5.2.2 States and state transitions in Idle Mode
Figure 2 shows the states and state transitions and procedures in RRC_IDLE.
Whenever a new PLMN selection is performed, it causes an exit to number 1.
Figure 5.2.2-1: RRC_IDLE Cell Selection and Reselection
### 5.2.3 Cell Selection process
#### 5.2.3.1 Description
The UE shall use one of the following two cell selection procedures:
a) Initial Cell Selection
This procedure requires no prior knowledge of which RF channels are E-UTRA
carriers. The UE shall scan all RF channels in the E-UTRA bands according to
its capabilities to find a suitable cell. On each carrier frequency, the UE
need only search for the strongest cell. Once a suitable cell is found this
cell shall be selected.
b) Stored Information Cell Selection
This procedure requires stored information of carrier frequencies and
optionally also information on cell parameters, from previously received
measurement control information elements or from previously detected cells.
Once the UE has found a suitable cell the UE shall select it. If no suitable
cell is found the Initial Cell Selection procedure shall be started.
NOTE: Priorities between different frequencies or RATs provided to the UE by
system information or dedicated signalling are not used in the cell selection
process.
#### 5.2.3.2 Cell Selection Criterion
The cell selection criterion S is fulfilled when:
Where:
Where:
the signalled value QrxlevminOffset is only applied when a cell is evaluated
for cell selection as a result of a periodic search for a higher priority PLMN
while camped normally in a VPLMN [5]. During this periodic search for higher
priority PLMN the UE may check the S criteria of a cell using parameter values
stored from a different cell of this higher priority PLMN.
* * *

value (RSRP). Q~rxlevmin~ Minimum required RX level in the cell (dBm)

power class as defined in [TS 36.101]
* * *
#### 5.2.3.3 CSG cells in Cell Selection
In addition to normal cell selection rules a manual selection of CSGs shall be
supported by the UE upon request from higher layers as defined in subclause
5.5.
#### 5.2.3.4 GSM case in Cell Selection
The cell selection criteria and procedures in GSM are specified in [9].
#### 5.2.3.5 UTRAN case in Cell Selection
The cell selection criteria and procedures in UTRAN are specified in [8].
### 5.2.4 Cell Reselection evaluation process
#### 5.2.4.1 Reselection priorities handling
Absolute priorities of different E-UTRAN frequencies or inter-RAT frequencies
may be provided to the UE in the system information, in the
_RRCConnectionRelease_ message, or by inheriting from another RAT at inter-RAT
cell (re)selection. In the case of system information, an E-UTRAN frequency or
inter-RAT frequency may be listed without providing a priority (i.e. the field
_cellReselectionPriority_ is absent for that frequency). If priorities are
provided in dedicated signalling, the UE shall ignore all the priorities
provided in system information. If UE is in _camped on any cell_ state, UE
shall only apply the priorities provided by system information from current
cell, and the UE preserves priorities provided by dedicated signalling unless
specified otherwise. When the UE in _camped normally_ state, has only
dedicated priorities other than for the current frequency, the UE shall
consider the current frequency to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower
than the eight network configured values). While the UE is camped on a
suitable CSG cell, the UE shall always consider the current frequency to be
the highest priority frequency (i.e. higher than the eight network configured
values), irrespective of any other priority value allocated to this frequency.
The UE shall delete priorities provided by dedicated signalling when:
  * the UE enters RRC_CONNECTED state; or
  * the optional validity time of dedicated priorities (T320) expires; or
  * a PLMN selection is performed on request by NAS [5].
NOTE: Equal priorities between RATs are not supported.
The UE shall only perform cell reselection evaluation for E-UTRAN frequencies
and inter-RAT frequencies that are given in system information and for which
the UE has a priority provided.
The UE shall not consider any black listed cells as candidate for cell
reselection.
The UE shall inherit the priorities provided by dedicated signalling and the
remaining validity time (i.e., T320 in E-UTRA, T322 in UTRA and T3230 in
GERAN), if configured, at inter-RAT cell (re)selection.
NOTE: The network may assign dedicated cell reselection priorities for
frequencies not configured by system information.
#### 5.2.4.2 Measurement rules for cell re-selection
When evaluating for reselection purposes cell selection criterion or
SnonServingCell,x, the UE shall use parameters provided by the serving cell.
Following rules are used by the UE to limit needed measurements:
\- If S~intrasearch~ is sent in the serving cell and S~ServingCell~ >
S~intrasearch~, UE may choose to not perform intra-frequency measurements.
\- If S~ServingCell~ \
S~nonintrasearch~ UE may choose not to perform measurements of E-UTRAN inter-
frequencies or inter-RAT frequency cells of equal or lower priority.
\- If S~ServingCell~ \ serving cell.
Cell reselection to a cell on an equal priority E-UTRAN frequency shall be
based on ranking for Intra-frequency cell reselection as defined in sub-clause
5.2.4.6.
Cell reselection to a cell on a lower priority E-UTRAN frequency or inter-RAT
frequency than serving frequency shall be performed if:
\- No cell on a higher priority E-UTRAN frequency or inter-RAT frequency than
serving frequency fulfills the criteria 1; and
\- No cell on serving frequency or on an equal priority E-UTRAN frequency
fulfills the criteria in 5.2.4.6; and
\- S~ServingCell~ \ \- more than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving
> cell.
For GERAN, UTRAN, and E-UTRAN, S~nonServingCell,x~ is the Srxlev-value of an
evaluated cell. For UTRAN FDD, Squal is higher than 0, as defined in [8]. For
cdma2000 RATs, S~nonServingCell,x~ is equal to -FLOOR(-2 x 10 x log10 Ec/Io)
in units of 0.5 dB, as defined in [18], with Ec/Io referring to the value
measured from the evaluated cell.
For cdma2000 RATs, Threshx, high and Threshx, low are equal to -1 times the
values signalled for the corresponding parameters in the system information.
In all the above criteria the value of Treselection~RAT~ is scaled when the UE
is in the medium or high mobility state as defined in subclause 5.2.4.3.1. If
more than one cell meets the above criteria, the UE shall reselect a cell
ranked as the best cell among the cells meeting the criteria on the highest
priority frequencies or the highest priority RATif the highest priority RAT is
E-UTRA according to criteria defined in 5.2.4.6.
#### 5.2.4.6 Intra-frequency and equal priority inter-frequency Cell
Reselection criteria
The cell-ranking criterion R~s~ for serving cell and R~n~ for neighbouring
cells is defined by:
where:
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ | Q~meas~ | RSRP measurement quantity used in cell reselections. | +---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ | Qoffset | For intra-frequency: Equals to Qoffset~s,n~, if | | | Qoffset~s,n~ is valid, otherwise this equals to zero. | | | | | | For inter-frequency: Equals to Qoffset~s,n~ plus | | | Qoffset~frequency~, if Qoffset~s,n~ is valid, otherwise | | | this equals to Qoffset~frequency~. | +---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
The UE shall perform ranking of all cells that fulfil the cell selection
criterion S, which is defined in 5.2.3.2, but may exclude all CSG cells that
are known by the UE to be not allowed.
The cells shall be ranked according to the R criteria specified above,
deriving Q~meas,n~ and Q~meas,s~ and calculating the R values using averaged
RSRP results.
If a cell is ranked as the best cell the UE shall perform cell reselection to
that cell. If this cell is found to be not-suitable, the UE shall behave
according to subclause 5.2.4.4.
In all cases, the UE shall reselect the new cell, only if the following
conditions are met:
\- the new cell is better ranked than the serving cell during a time interval
Treselection~RAT~;
\- more than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving
cell.
#### 5.2.4.7 Cell reselection parameters in system information broadcasts

high mobility state and _sf-Medium_ for Medium-mobility state
#### 5.2.4.8 Cell reselection with CSG cells
##### 5.2.4.8.1 Cell reselection from a non-CSG cell to a CSG cell
In addition to normal cell reselection, to detect suitable CSG cells the UE
shall use an autonomous search function for CSG cells on non-serving
frequencies when at least one CSG ID with associated PLMN identity is included
in the UE's a**llowed CSG** **list**. This UE autonomous search for CSG cells
may also include CSG cells of RATs other than E-UTRAN. The UE may also use
autonomous search on the serving frequency. The UE shall disable the
autonomous search function for CSG cells if the UE's allowed CSG list is
empty.
If the UE detects one or more suitable CSG cells on different frequencies,
then the UE shall reselect to one of the detected cells irrespective of the
frequency priority of the cell the UE is currently camped on, if the concerned
CSG cell is the highest ranked cell on that frequency.
If the UE detects a suitable CSG cell on the same frequency, it shall reselect
to this cell as per normal reselection rules (5.2.4.6.).
If the UE detects one or more suitable CSG cells on another RAT, the UE shall
reselect to one of them, if allowed according to [19].
##### 5.2.4.8.2 Cell reselection from a CSG cell
While camped on a suitable CSG cell, the UE shall apply the normal cell
reselection rules as defined in subclause 5.2.4.
To search for suitable CSG cells on non-serving frequencies, the UE may use an
autonomous search function. If the UE detects a CSG cell on a non-serving
frequency, the UE may reselect to the detected CSG cell if it is the highest
ranked cell on its frequency.
If the UE detects one or more suitable CSG cells on another RAT, the UE may
reselect to one of them if allowed according to [19].
### 5.2.5 Void
### 5.2.6 Camped Normally state
When camped normally, the UE shall perform the following tasks:
\- select and monitor the indicated Paging Channels of the cell as specified
in clause 7 according to information sent in system information;
\- monitor relevant System Information as specified in [3];
\- perform necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation
procedure;
\- execute the cell reselection evaluation process on the following
occasions/triggers:
1) UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in [10];
2) When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection evaluation
procedure has been modified.
### 5.2.7 Cell Selection when leaving RRC_CONNECTED state
On transition from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE, UE shall select a suitable cell
to camp on according to _redirectedCarrierInfo_ , if included in the
_RRCConnectionRelease_ message. Otherwise UE shall select a suitable cell on
an EUTRA carrier. If no suitable cell is found, the UE shall perform a cell
selection starting with Stored Information Cell Selection procedure in order
to find a suitable cell to camp on.
When returning to RRC_IDLE after UE moved to RRC_CONNECTED state from camped
on any cell state, UE shall select an acceptable cell to camp on according to
_redirectedCarrierInfo_ , if included in the _RRCConnectionRelease_ message.
Otherwise UE shall select an acceptable cell on an EUTRA carrier. If no
acceptable cell is found, the UE shall continue to search for an acceptable
cell of any PLMN in state _any cell selection_.
### 5.2.8 Any Cell Selection state
In this state, the UE shall attempt to find an acceptable cell of any PLMN to
camp on, trying all RATs that are supported by the UE and searching first for
a high quality cell, as defined in subclause 5.1.2.2.
The UE, which is not camped on any cell, shall stay in this state until an
acceptable cell is found.
### 5.2.9 Camped on Any Cell state
In this state, the UE shall perform the following tasks:
\- select and monitor the indicated paging channels of the cell as specified
in clause 7;
\- monitor relevant System Information as specified in [3];
\- perform necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation
procedure;
\- execute the cell reselection evaluation process on the following
occasions/triggers:
1) UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in [10];
2) When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection evaluation
procedure has been modified;
  * regularly attempt to find a suitable cell trying all frequencies of all RATs that are supported by the UE. If a suitable cell is found, UE shall move to camped normally state;
  * if the UE supports CS voice services, the UE should perform cell selection/ reselection to an acceptable cell of any supported RAT of either UTRAN or GERAN or CDMA2000 regardless of priorities provided in system information from current cell, if no suitable cell is found.
## 5.3 Cell Reservations and Access Restrictions
There are two mechanisms which allow an operator to impose cell reservations
or access restrictions. The first mechanism uses indication of cell status and
special reservations for control of cell selection and reselection procedures.
The second mechanism, referred to as Access Control, shall allow preventing
selected classes of users from sending initial access messages for load
control reasons. At subscription, one or more Access Classes are allocated to
the subscriber and stored in the USIM [4], which are employed for this
purpose.
### 5.3.1 Cell status and cell reservations
Cell status and cell reservations are indicated in the
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ [3] by means of two Information Elements:
\- **_cellBarred_** (IE type: \"barred\" or \"not barred\")\ In case of
multiple PLMNs indicated in SIB1, this IE is common for all PLMNs
\- **_cellReservedForOperatorUse_** (IE type: \"reserved\" or \"not
reserved\")\ In case of multiple PLMNs indicated in SIB1, this IE is specified
per PLMN.
When cell status is indicated as \"not barred\" and \"not reserved\" for
operator use,
\- All UEs shall treat this cell as candidate during the cell selection and
cell re-selection procedures.
When cell status is indicated as \"not barred\" and \"reserved\" for operator
use for any PLMN,
\- UEs assigned to Access Class 11 or 15 operating in their HPLMN/EHPLMN shall
treat this cell as candidate during the cell selection and reselection
procedures if the IE **_cellReservedForOperatorUse for that PLMN set to
"reserved"._**
**_\- UEs assigned to an_** Access Class **_in the range of 0 to 9, 12 to 14
shall behave as if the cell status is \"barred\" in case the cell is
\"reserved for operator use\" for the registered PLMN or the selected PLMN._**
NOTE 1: ACs 11, 15 are only valid for use in the HPLMN/ EHPLMN; ACs 12, 13, 14
are only valid for use in the home country [4].
When cell status \"barred\" is indicated or to be treated as if the cell
status is \"barred\",
\- The UE is not permitted to select/re-select this cell, not even for
emergency calls.
\- The UE shall select another cell according to the following rule:
\- If the cell is a CSG cell:
\- the UE may select another cell on the same frequency if the
selection/reselection criteria are fulfilled.
\- else
\- If the IE _intraFreqReselection_ in IE _cellAccessRelatedInfo_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ is set to \"allowed\", the UE may select another
cell on the same frequency if re-selection criteria are fulfilled.
\- The UE shall exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell
selection/reselection for 300 seconds.
\- If the IE _intraFreqReselection_ in IE _cellAccessRelatedInfo_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ is set to \"not allowed\" the UE shall not re-
select a cell on the same frequency as the barred cell;
\- The UE shall exclude the barred cell and the cells on the same frequency as
a candidate for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds.
The cell selection of another cell may also include a change of RAT.
### 5.3.2 Access control
Information on cell access restrictions associated with the Access Classes is
broadcast as system information, [3].
The UE shall ignore Access Class related cell access restrictions when
selecting a cell to camp on, i.e. it shall not reject a cell for camping on
because access on that cell is not allowed for any of the Access Classes of
the UE. A change of the indicated access restriction shall not trigger cell
reselection by the UE.
Access Class related cell access restrictions shall be checked by the UE when
starting RRC connection establishment procedure as specified in [3].
### 5.3.3 Emergency call
A restriction on emergency calls, if needed, isindicated by the IE a
_ccessBarringForEmergencyCalls_ [3]. If access class 10 is indicated as barred
in a cell, UEs with access class 0 to 9 or without an IMSI are not allowed to
initiate emergency calls in this cell. For UEs with access classes 11 to 15,
emergency calls are not allowed if both access class 10 and the relevant
access class (11 to 15) are barred. Otherwise, emergency calls are allowed for
those UEs.
Full details of operation under \"Access class barred list\" are described in
[4].
## 5.4 Tracking Area registration
In the UE, the AS shall report tracking area information to the NAS.
If the UE reads more than one PLMN identity in the current cell, the UE shall
report the found PLMN identities that make the cell suitable in the tracking
area information to NAS.
The NAS part of the location registration process is specified in [5].
Actions for the UE AS upon reception of Location Registration reject are
specified in [4] and [16].
## 5.5 Support for manual CSG ID selection
### 5.5.1 E-UTRA case
In the UE on request of NAS, the AS shall scan all RF channels in the E-UTRA
bands according to its capabilities to find available CSG cells. On each
carrier, the UE shall at least search for the strongest cell, read its system
information and report available CSG ID(s) belonging to the registered PLMN
together with their "HNB name" (if broadcast) to the NAS. The search for
available CSGs may be stopped on request of the NAS.
If NAS has selected a CSG and provided this selection to AS, the UE shall
search for an acceptable or suitable cell belonging to the selected CSG to
camp on.
### 5.5.2 UTRA case
Support for manual CSG selection in UTRA is described in [8].
# 6 Reception of broadcast information
## 6.1 Reception of system information
The NAS is informed if the cell selection and reselection results in changes
in the received NAS system information.
UE shall monitor PCH as described in chapter 7.1 to received System
Information change notifications in RRC_IDLE. Changes in the system
information are indicated by the network using a _Paging_ message. When the
_Paging_ message indicates system information changes then UE shall re-acquire
all system information as specified in [3].
## 6.2 Void
# 7 Paging
## 7.1 Discontinuous Reception for paging
The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in idle mode in order to reduce
power consumption. One Paging Occasion (PO) is a subframe where there may be
P-RNTI transmitted on PDCCH addressing the paging message. One Paging Frame
(PF) is one Radio Frame, which may contain one or multiple Paging Occasion(s).
When DRX is used the UE needs only to monitor one PO per DRX cycle.
PF and PO is determined by following formulae using the DRX parameters
provided in System Information:
> PF is given by following equation:
SFN mod T= (T div N)*(UE_ID mod N)
> Index i_s pointing to PO from subframe pattern defined in 7.2 will be
> derived from following calculation:
i_s = floor(UE_ID/N) mod Ns
System Information DRX parameters stored in the UE shall be updated locally in
the UE whenever the DRX parameter values are changed in SI. If the UE has no
IMSI, for instance when making an emergency call without USIM, the UE shall
use as default identity UE_ID = 0 in the PF and i_s formulas above.
The following Parameters are used for the calculation of the PF and i_s:
\- T: DRX cycle of the UE. T is determined by the shortest of the UE specific
DRX value, if allocated by upper layers, and a default DRX value broadcast in
system information. If UE specific DRX is not configured by upper layers, the
default value is applied.
\- nB: 4T, 2T, T, T/2, T/4, T/8, T/16, T/32.
\- N: min(T,nB)
\- Ns: max(1,nB/T)
\- UE_ID: IMSI mod 1024.
IMSI is given as sequence of digits of type Integer (0..9), IMSI shall in the
formulae above be interpreted as a decimal integer number, where the first
digit given in the sequence represents the highest order digit.
For example:
IMSI = 12 (digit1=1, digit2=2)
In the calculations, this shall be interpreted as the decimal integer \"12\",
not \"1x16+2 = 18\".
