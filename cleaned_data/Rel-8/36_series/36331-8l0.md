## 4.1 Introduction
This specification is organised as follows:
\- sub-clause 4.2 describes the RRC protocol model;
\- sub-clause 4.3 specifies the services provided to upper layers as well as
the services expected from lower layers;
\- sub-clause 4.4 lists the RRC functions;
\- clause 5 specifies RRC procedures, including UE state transitions;
\- clause 6 specifies the RRC message in a mixed format (i.e. tabular & ASN.1
together);
\- clause 7 specifies the variables (including protocol timers and constants)
and counters to be used by the UE;
\- clause 8 specifies the encoding of the RRC messages;
\- clause 9 specifies the specified and default radio configurations;
\- clause 10 specifies the RRC messages transferred across network nodes;
\- clause 11 specifies the UE capability related constraints and performance
requirements.
## 4.2 Architecture
### 4.2.1 UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is in RRC_CONNECTED when an RRC connection has been established. If this
is not the case, i.e. no RRC connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE
state. The RRC states can further be characterised as follows:
\- **RRC_IDLE** :
\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers.
\- UE controlled mobility;
\- The UE:
\- Monitors a Paging channel to detect incoming calls, system information
change, and for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS notification;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
\- Acquires system information.
\- **RRC_CONNECTED** :
\- Transfer of unicast data to/from UE.
\- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX.
\- Network controlled mobility, i.e. handover and cell change order with
optional network assistance (NACC) to GERAN;
\- The UE:
\- Monitors a Paging channel and/ or System Information Block Type 1 contents
to detect system information change, and for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS
notification;
Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to determine
if data is scheduled for it;
\- Provides channel quality and feedback information;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;
\- Acquires system information.
The following figure not only provides an overview of the RRC states in
E-UTRA, but also illustrates the mobility support between E-UTRAN, UTRAN and
GERAN.
Figure 4.2.1-1: E-UTRA states and inter RAT mobility procedures, 3GPP
The following figure illustrates the mobility support between E-UTRAN,
CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD. The details of the CDMA2000 state models are
out of the scope of this specification.
Figure 4.2.1-2: Mobility procedures between E-UTRA and CDMA2000
The inter-RAT handover procedure(s) supports the case of signalling,
conversational services, non-conversational services and combinations of
these. The mobility between E-UTRA and non-3GPP systems other than CDMA2000 is
FFS.
In addition to the state transitions shown in Figure 4.2.1-1 and Figure
4.2.1-2, there is support for connection release with redirection information
from E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED to GERAN, UTRAN and CDMA2000 (HRPD Idle/ 1xRTT
Dormant mode).
### 4.2.2 Signalling radio bearers
\"Signalling Radio Bearers\" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RB) that are
used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically, the
following three SRBs are defined:
\- SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
\- SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as
well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH
logical channel;
\- SRB2 is for NAS messages, using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower-
priority than SRB1 and is always configured by E-UTRAN after security
activation.
In downlink piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e.
with joint success/ failure) procedure: bearer establishment/ modification/
release. In uplink NAS message piggybacking is used only for transferring the
initial NAS message during connection setup.
NOTE: The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC
messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1 and SRB2, including those
containing NAS or non-3GPP messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by
PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS
messages.
## 4.3 Services
### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers
The RRC protocol offers the following services to upper layers:
\- Broadcast of common control information;
\- Notification of UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. about a terminating call, for ETWS;
\- Transfer of dedicated control information, i.e. information for one
specific UE.
### 4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers
In brief, the following are the main services that RRC expects from lower
layers:
\- PDCP: integrity protection and ciphering;
\- RLC: reliable and in-sequence transfer of information, without introducing
duplicates and with support for segmentation and concatenation.
Further details about the services provided by Packet Data Convergence
Protocol layer (e.g. integrity and ciphering) are provided in TS 36.323 [8].
The services provided by Radio Link Control layer (e.g. the RLC modes) are
specified in TS 36.322 [7]. Further details about the services provided by
Medium Access Control layer (e.g. the logical channels) are provided in TS
36.321 [6]. The services provided by physical layer (e.g. the transport
channels) are specified in TS 36.302 [3].
## 4.4 Functions
The RRC protocol includes the following main functions:
\- Broadcast of system information:
\- Including NAS common information;
\- Information applicable for UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. cell (re-)selection
parameters, neighbouring cell information and information (also) applicable
for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, e.g. common channel configuration information.
\- Including ETWS notification;
\- RRC connection control:
\- Paging;
\- Establishment/ modification/ release of RRC connection, including e.g.
assignment/ modification of UE identity (C-RNTI), establishment/ modification/
release of SRB1 and SRB2, access class barring;
\- Initial security activation, i.e. initial configuration of AS integrity
protection (SRBs) and AS ciphering (SRBs, DRBs);
\- RRC connection mobility including e.g. intra-frequency and inter-frequency
handover, associated security handling, i.e. key/ algorithm change,
specification of RRC context information transferred between network nodes;
\- Establishment/ modification/ release of RBs carrying user data (DRBs);
\- Radio configuration control including e.g. assignment/ modification of ARQ
configuration, HARQ configuration, DRX configuration;
\- QoS control including assignment/ modification of semi-persistent
scheduling (SPS) configuration information for DL and UL, assignment/
modification of parameters for UL rate control in the UE, i.e. allocation of a
priority and a prioritised bit rate (PBR) for each RB;
\- Recovery from radio link failure;
\- Inter-RAT mobility including e.g. security activation, transfer of RRC
context information;
\- Measurement configuration and reporting:
\- Establishment/ modification/ release of measurements (e.g. intra-frequency,
inter-frequency and inter- RAT measurements);
\- Setup and release of measurement gaps;
\- Measurement reporting;
\- Other functions including e.g. transfer of dedicated NAS information and
non-3GPP dedicated information, transfer of UE radio access capability
information, support for E-UTRAN sharing (multiple PLMN identities);
\- Generic protocol error handling;
\- Support of self-configuration and self-optimisation;
NOTE: Random access is specified entirely in the MAC including initial
transmission power estimation.
# 5 Procedures
## 5.1 General
### 5.1.1 Introduction
The procedural requirements are structured according to the main functional
areas: system information (5.2), connection control (5.3), inter-RAT mobility
(5.4) and measurements (5.5). In addition there is a sub-clause other (5.6)
that covers e.g. NAS dedicated information transfer, UE capability transfer.
Finally, sub-clause 5.7 specifies the generic error handling.
### 5.1.2 General requirements
The UE shall:
1> process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the
processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a
subsequent message;
NOTE 1: E-UTRAN may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the
UE\'s response of a previously initiated procedure.
1> within a sub-clause execute the steps according to the order specified in
the procedural description;
1> set the _rrc-TransactionIdentifier_ in the response message, if included,
to the same value as included in the message received from E-UTRAN that
triggered the response message;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to \'_setup_ \':
2> apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the
associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to \'_release_ \':
2> clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated
resources;
NOTE 2: At each point in time, the UE keeps a single value for each field
except for during handover when the UE temporarily stores the previous
configuration so it can revert back upon handover failure. In other words:
when the UE reconfigures a field, the existing value is released except for
during handover.
## 5.2 System information
### 5.2.1 Introduction
#### 5.2.1.1 General
System information is divided into the _MasterInformationBlock_ (MIB) and a
number of _SystemInformationBlocks_ (SIBs). The MIB includes a limited number
of most essential and most frequently transmitted parameters that are needed
to acquire other information from the cell, and is transmitted on BCH. SIBs
other than _SystemInformationBlockType1_ are carried in _SystemInformation_
(SI) messages and mapping of SIBs to SI messages is flexibly configurable by
_schedulingInfoList_ included in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , with
restrictions that: each SIB is contained only in a single SI message, only
SIBs having the same scheduling requirement (periodicity) can be mapped to the
same SI message, and _SystemInformationBlockType2_ is always mapped to the SI
message that corresponds to the first entry in the list of SI messages in
_schedulingInfoList_. There may be multiple SI messages transmitted with the
same periodicity. _SystemInformationBlockType1_ and all SI messages are
transmitted on DL-SCH.
#### 5.2.1.2 Scheduling
The MIB uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 40 ms and repetitions made
within 40 ms. The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframe #0 of
radio frames for which the SFN mod 4 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in
subframe #0 of all other radio frames.
The _SystemInformationBlockType1_ uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of
80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms. The first transmission of
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ is scheduled in subframe #5 of radio frames for
which the SFN mod 8 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #5 of all
other radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0.
The SI messages are transmitted within periodically occurring time domain
windows (referred to as SI-windows) using dynamic scheduling. Each SI message
is associated with a SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do
not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is
transmitted. The length of the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is
configurable. Within the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be
transmitted a number of times in any subframe other than MBSFN subframes,
uplink subframes in TDD, and subframe #5 of radio frames for which SFN mod 2 =
0. The UE acquires the detailed time-domain scheduling (and other information,
e.g. frequency-domain scheduling, used transport format) from decoding SI-RNTI
on PDCCH (see TS 36.321 [6]).
A single SI-RNTI is used to address _SystemInformationBlockType1_ as well as
all SI messages.
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ configures the SI-window length and the
transmission periodicity for the SI messages.
#### 5.2.1.3 System information validity and notification of changes
Change of system information (other than for ETWS) only occurs at specific
radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. System
information may be transmitted a number of times with the same content within
a modification period, as defined by its scheduling. The modification period
boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod _m_ = 0, where _m_ is
the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The
modification period is configured by system information.
When the network changes (some of the) system information, it first notifies
the UEs about this change, i.e. this may be done throughout a modification
period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated
system information. These general principles are illustrated in figure
5.2.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different system information.
Upon receiving a change notification, the UE acquires the new system
information immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE
applies the previously acquired system information until the UE acquires the
new system information.
Figure 5.2.1.3-1: Change of system Information
The _Paging_ message is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in
RRC_CONNECTED about a system information change. If the UE receives a _Paging_
message including the _systemInfoModification_ , it knows that the system
information will change at the next modification period boundary. Although the
UE may be informed about changes in system information, no further details are
provided e.g. regarding which system information will change.
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ includes a value tag, _systemInfoValueTag_ ,
that indicates if a change has occurred in the SI messages. UEs may use
_systemInfoValueTag_ , e.g. upon return from out of coverage, to verify if the
previously stored SI messages are still valid. Additionally, the UE considers
stored system information to be invalid after 3 hours from the moment it was
successfully confirmed as valid, unless specified otherwise.
E-UTRAN may not update _systemInfoValueTag_ upon change of some system
information e.g. ETWS information, regularly changing parameters like CDMA2000
system time (see 6.3). Similarly, E-UTRAN may not include the
_systemInfoModification_ within the _Paging_ message upon change of some
system information.
The UE verifies that stored system information remains valid by either
checking _systemInfoValueTag_ in _SystemInformationBlockType1 after the
modification period boundary, or_ attempting to find the
_systemInfoModification indication at least modificationPeriodCoeff times
during the modification period in case no paging is received, in every
modification period._ If no paging message is received by the UE during a
modification period, the UE may assume that no change of system information
will occur at the next modification period boundary. If UE in RRC_CONNECTED,
during a modification period, receives one paging message, it may deduce from
the presence/ absence of _systemInfoModification whether a change of system
information other than ETWS information will occur in the next modification
period or not._
ETWS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall attempt to read paging at least once
every _defaultPagingCycle_ to check whether ETWS notification is present or
not.
#### 5.2.1.4 Indication of ETWS notification
ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification can occur at any
point in time. The _Paging_ message is used to inform ETWS capable UEs in
RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about presence of an ETWS primary
notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification. If the UE receives a
_Paging_ message including the _etws-Indication_ , it shall start receiving
the ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification according to
_schedulingInfoList_ contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_.
NOTE: The UE is not required to periodically check _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , but _Paging_ message including
the _etws-Indication_ triggers the UE to re-acquire _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ for scheduling changes for
_SystemInformationBlockType10_ and _SystemInformationBlockType11_. The UE may
or may not receive a _Paging_ message including the _etws_ -_Indication_
and/or _systemInfoModification_ when ETWS is no longer scheduled.
ETWS primary notification is contained in _SystemInformationBlockType10_ and
ETWS secondary notification is contained in _SystemInformationBlockType11_.
Segmentation can be applied for the delivery of a secondary notification. The
segmentation is fixed for transmission of a given secondary notification
within a cell (i.e. the same segment size for a given segment with the same
_messageIdentifier_ , _serialNumber_ and _warningMessageSegmentNumber_).
### 5.2.2 System information acquisition
#### 5.2.2.1 General
Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition, normal
The UE applies the system information acquisition procedure to acquire the AS-
and NAS- system information that is broadcasted by the E-UTRAN. The procedure
applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED.
#### 5.2.2.2 Initiation
The UE shall apply the system information acquisition procedure upon selecting
(e.g. upon power on) and upon re-selecting a cell, after handover completion,
after entering E-UTRA from another RAT, upon return from out of coverage, upon
receiving a notification that the system information has changed, upon
receiving an indication about the presence of an ETWS notification, upon
receiving a request from CDMA2000 upper layers and upon exceeding the maximum
validity duration. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural
specification, the system information acquisition procedure overwrites any
stored system information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for
system information and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in
system information unless explicitly specified otherwise.
#### 5.2.2.3 System information required by the UE
The UE shall:
1> ensure having a valid version, as defined below, of (at least) the
following system information, also referred to as the \'required\' system

## 5.3 Connection control
### 5.3.1 Introduction
#### 5.3.1.1 RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. E-UTRAN
completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment
of the S1 connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from
the EPC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase
of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the
E-UTRAN may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting. However, the UE
only accepts a handover message when security has been activated.
NOTE: In case the serving frequency broadcasts multiple overlapping bands,
E-UTRAN can only configure measurements after having obtained the UE
capabilities, as the measurement configuration needs to be set according to
the band selected by the UE.
Upon receiving the UE context from the EPC, E-UTRAN activates security (both
ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial security activation
procedure. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful
response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after
completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to
activate security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to
establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered.
After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN
initiates the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. E-UTRAN may do this prior
to receiving the confirmation of the initial security activation from the UE.
In any case, E-UTRAN will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for
the RRC connection reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2 and DRBs.
E-UTRAN should release the RRC connection if the initial security activation
and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails (i.e. security activation and DRB
establishment are triggered by a joint S1-procedure, which does not support
partial success).
For SRB2 and DRBs, security is always activated from the start, i.e. the
E-UTRAN does not establish these bearers prior to activating security.
The release of the RRC connection is initiated by E-UTRAN. The procedure may
be used to re-direct the UE to another frequency or RAT. In exceptional cases
the UE may abort the RRC connection, i.e. move to RRC_IDLE without notifying
E-UTRAN.
#### 5.3.1.2 Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection of RRC signalling (SRBs) as
well as the ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the security parameters which are part of the
AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm
and two parameters, namely the _keyChangeIndicator_ and the
_nextHopChainingCount,_ which are used by the UE to determine the AS security
keys upon handover and/ or connection re-establishment.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for signalling radio bearers SRB1
and SRB2. The ciphering algorithm is common for all radio bearers (i.e. SRB1,
SRB2 and DRBs). Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.
RRC integrity and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one
message/ procedure. RRC integrity and ciphering are never de-activated.
However, it is possible to switch to a \'NULL\' ciphering algorithm (eea0).
NOTE 1: UICC-less emergency calls are not supported in this release of the
specification.
NOTE 2: Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity check has
failed and indicate the integrity verification check failure to RRC.
The AS applies three different security keys: one for the integrity protection
of RRC signalling (K~RRCint~), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling
(K~RRCenc~) and one for the ciphering of user data (K~UPenc~). All three AS
keys are derived from the K~eNB~ key. The K~eNB~ is based on the K~ASME~ key,
which is handled by upper layers.
Upon connection establishment new AS keys are derived. No AS-parameters are
exchanged to serve as inputs for the derivation of the new AS keys at
connection establishment.
The integrity and ciphering of the RRC message used to perform handover is
based on the security configuration used prior to the handover and is
performed by the source eNB.
The integrity and ciphering algorithms can only be changed upon handover. The
four AS keys (K~eNB,~ K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~) change upon every
handover and connection re-establishment. The _keyChangeIndicator_ is used
upon handover and indicates whether the UE should use the keys associated with
the latest available K~ASME~ key. The _nextHopChainingCount_ parameter is used
upon handover and connection re-establishment by the UE when deriving the new
K~eNB~ that is used to generate K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~ (see TS
33.401 [32]). An intra cell handover procedure may be used to change the keys
in RRC_CONNECTED.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 36.323
[8]) is maintained for each direction. For each DRB, the COUNT is used as
input for ciphering. For each SRB, the COUNT is used as input for both
ciphering and integrity protection. It is not allowed to use the same COUNT
value more than once for a given security key. In order to limit the
signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence
number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8]). In addition, an overflow
counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (TX_HFN and RX_HFN, as
specified in TS 36.323 [8]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE
and the eNB. The eNB is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the
same RB identity and with the same K~eNB~, e.g. due to the transfer of large
volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs. In order to avoid such
re-use, the eNB may e.g. use different RB identities for successive RB
establishments, trigger an intra cell handover or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE
to RRC_CONNECTED transition.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit
BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is
the value of the corresponding _srb-Identity_ with the MSBs padded with
zeroes.
#### 5.3.1.3 Connected mode mobility
In RRC_CONNECTED, the network controls UE mobility, i.e. the network decides
when the UE shall move to which cell (which may be on another frequency or
RAT). For network controlled mobility in RRC_CONNECTED, handover is the only
procedure that is defined. The network triggers the handover procedure e.g.
based on radio conditions, load. To facilitate this, the network may configure
the UE to perform measurement reporting (possibly including the configuration
of measurement gaps). The network may also initiate handover blindly, i.e.
without having received measurement reports from the UE.
Before sending the handover message to the UE, the source eNB prepares one or
more target cells. The target eNB generates the message used to perform the
handover, i.e. the message including the AS-configuration to be used in the
target cell. The source eNB transparently (i.e. does not alter values/
content) forwards the handover message/ information received from the target
to the UE. When appropriate, the source eNB may initiate data forwarding for
(a subset of) the DRBs.
After receiving the handover message, the UE attempts to access the target
cell at the first available RACH occasion according to Random Access resource
selection defined in TS 36.321 [6], i.e. the handover is asynchronous.
Consequently, when allocating a dedicated preamble for the random access in
the target cell, E-UTRA shall ensure it is available from the first RACH
occasion the UE may use. Upon successful completion of the handover, the UE
sends a message used to confirm the handover.
After the successful completion of handover, PDCP SDUs may be re-transmitted
in the target cell. This only applies for DRBs using RLC-AM mode. The further
details are specified in TS 36.323 [8]. After the successful completion of
handover, the SN and the HFN are reset except for the DRBs using RLC-AM mode
(for which both SN and HFN continue). The further details are specified in TS
36.323 [8].
One UE behaviour to be performed upon handover is specified, i.e. this is
regardless of the handover procedures used within the network (e.g. whether
the handover includes X2 or S1 signalling procedures).
The source eNB should, for some time, maintain a context to enable the UE to
return in case of handover failure. After having detected handover failure,
the UE attempts to resume the RRC connection either in the source or in
another cell using the RRC re-establishment procedure. This connection
resumption succeeds only if the accessed cell is prepared, i.e. concerns a
cell of the source eNB or of another eNB towards which handover preparation
has been performed.
### 5.3.2 Paging
#### 5.3.2.1 General
Figure 5.3.2.1-1: Paging
The purpose of this procedure is to transmit paging information to a UE in
RRC_IDLE and/ or to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about a
system information change and/ or about an ETWS primary notification and/ or
ETWS secondary notification. The paging information is provided to upper
layers, which in response may initiate RRC connection establishment, e.g. to
receive an incoming call.
#### 5.3.2.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the paging procedure by transmitting the _Paging_ message at
the UE\'s paging occasion as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. E-UTRAN may address
multiple UEs within a _Paging_ message by including one _PagingRecord_ for
each UE. E-UTRAN may also indicate a change of system information and/ or
provide an ETWS notification in the _Paging_ message.
#### 5.3.2.3 Reception of the _Paging_ message by the UE
Upon receiving the _Paging_ message, the UE shall:
1> if in RRC_IDLE, for each of the _PagingRecord_ , if any, included in the
_Paging_ message:
2> if the _ue-Identity_ included in the _PagingRecord_ matches one of the UE
identities allocated by upper layers:
3> forward the _ue-Identity_ and the _cn-Domain_ to the upper layers;
1> if the _systemInfoModification_ is included:
2> re-acquire the required system information using the system information
acquisition procedure as specified in 5.2.2.
1> if the _etws-Indication_ is included and the UE is ETWS capable:
2> re-acquire _SystemInformationBlockType1_ immediately, i.e., without waiting
until the next system information modification period boundary;
2> if the _schedulingInfoList_ indicates that _SystemInformationBlockType10_
is present:
3> acquire _SystemInformationBlockType10_ ;
2> if the _schedulingInfoList_ indicates that _SystemInformationBlockType11_
is present:
3> acquire _SystemInformationBlockType11_ ;

### 5.3.6 Counter check
#### 5.3.6.1 General
Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by E-UTRAN to request the UE to verify the
amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is
requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT
match with the values indicated by E-UTRAN.
NOTE: The procedure enables E-UTRAN to detect packet insertion by an intruder
(a \'man in the middle\').
#### 5.3.6.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending a _CounterCheck_ message.
NOTE: E-UTRAN may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values reaches
a specific value.

are different from the value indicated in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ :
3> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of the corresponding COUNT;
1> for each DRB that is included in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ in the
_CounterCheck_ message that is not established:
2> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ with the most significant bits set identical to the corresponding
values in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ and the least significant bits set to
zero;

### 5.3.7 RRC connection re-establishment
#### 5.3.7.1 General
Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful
Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC connection re-establishment, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection, which
involves the resumption of SRB1 operation and the re-activation of security.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which security has been activated, may initiate the
procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-
establishment succeeds only if the concerned cell is prepared i.e. has a valid
UE context. In case E-UTRAN accepts the re-establishment, SRB1 operation
resumes while the operation of other radio bearers remains suspended. If AS
security has not been activated, the UE does not initiate the procedure but
instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- to reconfigure SRB1 and to resume data transfer only for this RB;
\- to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms.
#### 5.3.7.2 Initiation
The UE shall only initiate the procedure when AS security has been activated.
The UE initiates the procedure when one of the following conditions is met:
1> upon detecting radio link failure, in accordance with 5.3.11; or
1> upon handover failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.6; or
1> upon mobility from E-UTRA failure, in accordance with 5.4.3.5; or
1> upon integrity check failure indication from lower layers; or
1> upon an RRC connection reconfiguration failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.5;
Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
1> stop timer T310, if running;
1> start timer T311;
1> suspend all RBs except SRB0;
1> reset MAC;
1> apply the default physical channel configuration as specified in 9.2.4;
1> apply the default semi-persistent scheduling configuration as specified in
9.2.3;
1> apply the default MAC main configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
1> perform cell selection in accordance with the cell selection process as
specified in TS 36.304 [4];
#### 5.3.7.3 Actions following cell selection while T311 is running
Upon selecting a suitable E-UTRA cell, the UE shall:
1> stop timer T311;
1> start timer T301;
1> apply the _timeAlignmentTimerCommon_ included in
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ ;
1> initiate transmission of the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message
in accordance with 5.3.7.4;
NOTE: This procedure applies also if the UE returns to the source cell.
Upon selecting an inter-RAT cell, the UE shall:
1> perform the actions upon leaving RRC_CONNECTED as specified in 5.3.12, with
release cause \'RRC connection failure\';
#### 5.3.7.4 Actions related to transmission of
_RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message
The UE shall set the contents of _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message
as follows:
1> set the _ue-Identity_ as follows:
2> set the _c-RNTI_ to the C-RNTI used in the source cell (handover and
mobility from E-UTRA failure) or used in the cell in which the trigger for the
re-establishment occurred (other cases);
2> set the _physCellId_ to the physical cell identity of the source cell
(handover and mobility from E-UTRA failure) or of the cell in which the
trigger for the re-establishment occurred (other cases);
2> set the _shortMAC-I_ to the 16 least significant bits of the MAC-I
calculated:
3> over the ASN.1 encoded as per section 8 (i.e., a multiple of 8 bits)
_VarShortMAC-Input_ ;
3> with the K~RRCint~ key and integrity protection algorithm that was used in
the source cell (handover and mobility from E-UTRA failure) or of the cell in
which the trigger for the re-establishment occurred (other cases); and
3> with all input bits for COUNT, BEARER and DIRECTION set to binary ones;
1> set the _reestablishmentCause_ as follows:
2> if the re-establishment procedure was initiated due to reconfiguration
failure as specified in 5.3.5.5 (the UE is unable to comply with the
reconfiguration):
3> set the _reestablishmentCause_ to the value \'_reconfigurationFailure_ \';
2> else if the re-establishment procedure was initiated due to handover
failure as specified in 5.3.5.6 (intra-LTE handover failure) or 5.4.3.5
(inter-RAT mobility from EUTRA failure):
3> set the _reestablishmentCause_ to the value \'_handoverFailure_ \';
2> else:
3> set the _reestablishmentCause_ to the value \'_otherFailure_ \';
The UE shall submit the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message to lower
layers for transmission.

## 5.4 Inter-RAT mobility
### 5.4.1 Introduction
The general principles of connected mode mobility are described in 5.3.1.3.
The general principles of the security handling upon connected mode mobility
are described in 5.3.1.2.
For the (network controlled) inter RAT mobility from E-UTRA for a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED, a single procedure is defined that supports both handover and
cell change order with optional network assistance (NACC). In case of mobility
to CDMA2000, the eNB decides when to move to the other RAT while the target
RAT determines to which cell the UE shall move.
### 5.4.2 Handover to E-UTRA
#### 5.4.2.1 General
Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to E-UTRA, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network,
transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g.
GERAN or UTRAN) to E-UTRAN.
The handover to E-UTRA procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination
with DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN
applies only after integrity has been activated in UTRAN.
#### 5.4.2.2 Initiation
The RAN using another RAT initiates the Handover to E-UTRA procedure, in
accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by sending
the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message via the radio access technology
from which the inter-RAT handover is performed.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated
in the other RAT;
\- to establish SRB1, SRB2 and one or more DRBs, i.e. at least the DRB
associated with the default EPS bearer is established;
#### 5.4.2.3 Reception of the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ by the UE
If the UE is able to comply with the configuration included in the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message, the UE shall:
1> apply the default physical channel configuration as specified in 9.2.4;
1> apply the default semi-persistent scheduling configuration as specified in
9.2.3;
1> apply the default MAC main configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
1> start timer T304 with the timer value set to _t304,_ as included in the
_mobilityControlInfo_ ;
1> consider the target cell to be one on the frequency indicated by the
_carrierFreq_ with a physical cell identity indicated by the
_targetPhysCellId_ ;
1> start synchronising to the DL of the target cell;
1> set the C-RNTI to the value of the _newUE-Identity_ ;
1> for the target cell, apply the downlink bandwidth indicated by the _dl-
Bandwidth;_
1> for the target cell, apply the uplink bandwidth indicated by (the absence
or presence of) the _ul-Bandwidth;_
1> perform the radio resource configuration procedure as specified in 5.3.10;
1> forward the _nas-SecurityParamToEUTRA_ to the upper layers;
1> derive the K~eNB~ key, as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
1> store the _nextHopChainingCount_ value;
1> derive the K~RRCint~ key associated with the _integrityProtAlgorithm_ , as
specified in TS 33.401 [32];
1> derive the K~RRCenc~ key and the K~UPenc~ key associated with the
_cipheringAlgorithm_ , as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
1> configure lower layers to apply the indicated integrity protection
algorithm and the K~RRCint~ key immediately, i.e. the indicated integrity
protection configuration shall be applied to all subsequent messages received
and sent by the UE, including the message used to indicate the successful
completion of the procedure;
1> configure lower layers to apply the indicated ciphering algorithm, the
K~RRCenc~ key and the K~UPenc~ key immediately, i.e. the indicated ciphering
configuration shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by
the UE, including the message used to indicate the successful completion of
the procedure;
1> if the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message includes the _measConfig_ :
2> perform the measurement configuration procedure as specified in 5.5.2;
1> submit the _RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete_ message to lower layers
for transmission using the new configuration;
1> use the default values specified in 9.2.5 for timer T310, T311 and constant
N310, N311;
1> if MAC successfully completes the random access procedure:
2> stop timer T304;
2> apply the parts of the configuration that do not require the UE to know the
SFN of the target cell;
2> apply the parts of the measurement and the radio resource configuration
that require the UE to know the SFN of the target cell (e.g. measurement gaps,
periodic CQI reporting, scheduling request configuration, sounding RS
configuration), if any, upon acquiring the SFN of the target cell;
2> enter E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED, upon which the procedure ends;
> Editor\'s note: The handling of outstanding signalling/ data may need to be
> clarified.
#### 5.4.2.4 Reconfiguration failure
The UE shall:
1> if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in
the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message:
2> perform the actions defined for this failure case as defined in the
specifications applicable for the other RAT;
NOTE 1: The UE may apply above failure handling also in case the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message causes a protocol error for which the
generic error handling as defined in 5.7 specifies that the UE shall ignore
the message.
NOTE 2: If the UE is unable to comply with part of the configuration, it does
not apply any part of the configuration, i.e. there is no partial success/
failure.
#### 5.4.2.5 T304 expiry (handover to E-UTRA failure)
The UE shall:
1> upon T304 expiry (handover to E-UTRA failure):
2> reset MAC;
2> perform the actions defined for this failure case as defined in the
specifications applicable for the other RAT;
### 5.4.3 Mobility from E-UTRA
#### 5.4.3.1 General
Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from E-UTRA, successful
Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from E-UTRA, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to a cell using
another Radio Access Technology (RAT), e.g. GERAN, UTRA or CDMA2000 systems.
The mobility from E-UTRA procedure covers both:
\- handover, i.e. the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes radio
resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell; and
\- cell change order, i.e. the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message may include
information facilitating access of and/ or connection establishment in the
target cell, e.g. system information. Cell change order is applicable only to
GERAN.
#### 5.4.3.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the mobility from E-UTRA procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED,
possibly in response to a _MeasurementReport_ message, by sending a
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message. E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- the procedure is initiated only when AS-security has been activated, and
SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
#### 5.4.3.3 Reception of the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ by the UE
The UE shall be able to receive a _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message and
perform a cell change order to GERAN, even if no prior UE measurements have
been performed on the target cell.
The UE shall:
1> stop timer T310, if running;
1> if the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes the _purpose_ set to
\'_handover_ \':
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to \'_utra_ \' or \'_geran_ \':
3> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards the RAT indicated by the
_targetRAT-Type_ included in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message;
3> forward the _nas-SecurityParamFromEUTRA_ to the upper layers;
3> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance
with the specifications of the target RAT;
> 3> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to \'_geran_ \':
4> use the contents of _systemInformation_ , if provided for PS Handover, as
the system information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
NOTE 1: If there are DRBs for which no radio bearers are established in the
target RAT as indicated in the _targetRAT-MessageContainer_ in the message,
the E-UTRA RRC part of the UE does not indicate the release of the concerned
DRBs to the upper layers. Upper layers may derive which bearers are not
established from information received from the AS of the target RAT.
NOTE 2: In case of SR-VCC, the DRB to be replaced is specified in [51].
2> else if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to \'_cdma2000-1XRTT_ \' or
\'_cdma2000-HRPD_ \':
3> forward the _targetRAT-Type_ and the _targetRAT-MessageContainer_ to the
CDMA2000 upper layers for the UE to access the cell indicated in the inter-RAT
message in accordance with the specifications of the CDMA2000 target-RAT;
1> else if the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes the _purpose_ set
to \'_cellChangeOrder_ \':
2> start timer T304 with the timer value set to _t304,_ as included in the
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message;
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to \'_geran_ \':
3> if _networkControlOrder_ is included in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_
message:
4> apply the value as specified in TS 44.060 [36];
3> else:
4> acquire _networkControlOrder_ and apply the value as specified in TS 44.060
[36];
3> use the contents of _systemInformation_ , if provided, as the system
information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
2> establish the connection to the target cell indicated in the
_CellChangeOrder_ ;
NOTE 3: The criteria for success or failure of the cell change order to GERAN
are specified in TS 44.060[36].
#### 5.4.3.4 Successful completion of the mobility from E-UTRA
Upon successfully completing the handover or the cell change order, the UE
shall:
1> perform the actions upon leaving RRC_CONNECTED as specified in 5.3.12, with
release cause \'other\';
1> stop timer T304, if running;
#### 5.4.3.5 Mobility from E-UTRA failure
The UE shall:
1> if T304 expires (mobility from E-UTRA failure); or
1> if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target
radio access technology; or
1> if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in
the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message; or
1> if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included in the
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message, causing the UE to fail the procedure
according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT:
2> stop T304, if running;
2> if the _cs-FallbackIndicator_ in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message was
set to \'_TRUE_ \':
_3 >_ indicate to upper layers that the CS Fallback procedure has failed;
2> revert back to the configuration used in the source cell, excluding the
configuration configured by the _physicalConfigDedicated_ , _mac-MainConfig_
and _sps-Config_ ;
2> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7;
### 5.4.4 Handover from E-UTRA preparation request (CDMA2000)
#### 5.4.4.1 General
Figure 5.4.4.1-1: Handover from E-UTRA preparation request
The purpose of this procedure is to trigger the UE to prepare for handover to
CDMA2000 by requesting a connection with this network. This procedure applies
to CDMA2000 capable UEs only.
The handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure applies when signalling
radio bearers are established.
#### 5.4.4.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure to a
UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a _MeasurementReport_ message, by
sending a _HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ message. E-UTRA initiates the
procedure only when AS security has been activated.
#### 5.4.4.3 Reception of the _HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ by the UE
Upon reception of the _HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ message, the UE
shall:
1> indicate the request to prepare handover and forward the _cdma2000-Type_ to
the CDMA2000 upper layers;
1> if _cdma2000-Type_ is set to \'_type1XRTT_ \':
2> forward the _rand_ and the _mobilityParametersCDMA2000_ to the CDMA2000
upper layers;
### 5.4.5 UL handover preparation transfer (CDMA2000)
#### 5.4.5.1 General
Figure 5.4.5.1-1: UL handover preparation transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to tunnel the handover related CDMA2000
dedicated information from UE to E-UTRAN when requested by the higher layers.
The procedure is triggered by the higher layers on receipt of
_HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ message. This procedure applies to
CDMA2000 capable UEs only.
#### 5.4.5.2 Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL Handover Preparation Transfer procedure
whenever there is a need to transfer handover related non-3GPP dedicated
information. The UE initiates the UL handover preparation transfer procedure
by sending the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message.
#### 5.4.5.3 Actions related to transmission of the
_ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message
The UE shall set the contents of the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message
as follows:
1> include the _cdma2000-Type_ and the _dedicatedInfoCDMA2000_ ;
1> if the _cdma2000-Type_ is set to \'_type1XRTT_ \':
2> include the _meid_ and set it to the value received from the CDMA2000 upper
layers;
1> submit the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
#### 5.4.5.4 Failure to deliver the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message
The UE shall:
1> if the UE is unable to guarantee successful delivery of
_ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ messages:
2> inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the information
contained in the concerned _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message;
### 5.4.6 Inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN
#### 5.4.6.1 General
The purpose of the inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN procedure is to
transfer, under the control of the source radio access technology, a
connection between the UE and another radio access technology (e.g. GSM/ GPRS)
to E-UTRAN.
#### 5.4.6.2 Initiation
The procedure is initiated when a radio access technology other than E-UTRAN,
e.g. GSM/GPRS, using procedures specific for that RAT, orders the UE to change
to an E-UTRAN cell. In response, upper layers request the establishment of an
RRC connection as specified in subclause 5.3.3.
NOTE: Within the message used to order the UE to change to an E-UTRAN cell,
the source RAT should specify the identity of the target E-UTRAN cell as
specified in the specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1> upon receiving an _RRCConnectionSetup_ message:
2> consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have completed
succesfully;
#### 5.4.6.3 UE fails to complete an inter-RAT cell change order
If the inter-RAT cell change order fails the UE shall return to the other
radio access technology and proceed as specified in the appropriate
specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1> upon failure to establish the RRC connection as specified in subclause
5.3.3:
2> consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have failed;
NOTE: The cell change was network ordered. Therefore, failure to change to the
target cell should not cause the UE to move to UE-controlled cell selection.
## 5.5 Measurements
### 5.5.1 Introduction
The UE reports measurement information in accordance with the measurement
configuration as provided by E-UTRAN. E-UTRAN provides the measurement
configuration applicable for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED by means of dedicated
signalling, i.e. using the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message.
The UE can be requested to perform the following types of measurements:
\- Intra-frequency measurements: measurements at the downlink carrier
frequency of the serving cell.
\- Inter-frequency measurements: measurements at frequencies that differ from
the downlink carrier frequency of the serving cell.
\- Inter-RAT measurements of UTRA frequencies.
\- Inter-RAT measurements of GERAN frequencies.
\- Inter-RAT measurements of CDMA2000 HRPD or CDMA2000 1xRTT frequencies.
The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
1\. **Measurement objects:** The objects on which the UE shall perform the
measurements.
\- For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object
is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency,
E-UTRAN can configure a list of cell specific offsets and a list of
\'blacklisted\' cells. Blacklisted cells are not considered in event
evaluation or measurement reporting.
\- For inter-RAT UTRA measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a
single UTRA carrier frequency.
\- For inter-RAT GERAN measurements a measurement object is a set of GERAN
carrier frequencies.
\- For inter-RAT CDMA2000 measurements a measurement object is a set of cells
on a single (HRPD or 1xRTT) carrier frequency.
2\. **Reporting configurations** : A list of reporting configurations where
each reporting configuration consists of the following:
\- Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a
measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event
description.
\- Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement
report and associated information (e.g. number of cells to report).
3\. **Measurement identities** : A list of measurement identities where each
measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting
configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities it is possible
to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration,
as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same
measurement object. The measurement identity is used as a reference number in
the measurement report.
4\. **Quantity configurations:** One quantity configuration is configured per
RAT type. The quantity configuration defines the measurement quantities and
associated filtering used for all event evaluation and related reporting of
that measurement type. One filter can be configured per measurement quantity.
5\. **Measurement gaps:** Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements,
i.e. no (UL, DL) transmissions are scheduled.
E-UTRAN only configures a single measurement object for a given frequency,
i.e. it is not possible to configure two or more measurement objects for the
same frequency with different associated parameters, e.g. different offsets
and/ or blacklists. E-UTRAN may configure multiple instances of the same event
e.g. by configuring two reporting configurations with different thresholds.
The UE maintains a single measurement object list, a single reporting
configuration list, and a single measurement identities list. The measurement
object list includes measurement objects, that are specified per RAT type,
possibly including an intra-frequency object (i.e. the object corresponding to
the serving frequency), inter-frequency object(s) and inter-RAT objects.
Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes E-UTRA and inter-RAT
reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any
reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations
may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects
may not be linked to a reporting configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1\. The serving cell.
2\. Listed cells - these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).
3\. Detected cells - these are cells that are not listed within the
measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the carrier frequency(ies)
indicated by the measurement object(s).
For E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on the serving cell, listed cells and
detected cells. For inter-RAT UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed
cells. For inter-RAT GERAN, the UE measures and reports on detected cells. For
inter-RAT CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports on listed cells.
NOTE 1: For inter-RAT UTRA and CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports also on
detected cells for the purpose of SON.
NOTE 2: This specification is based on the assumption that CSG cells of home
deployment type are not indicated within the neighbour list. Furthermore, the
assumption is that for non-home deployments, the physical cell identity is
unique within the area of a large macro cell (i.e. as for UTRAN).
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in sub-clause
5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the _VarMeasConfig_
unless explictly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration
procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received _measConfig_.

### 5.5.3 Performing measurements
#### 5.5.3.1 General
The UE supports measurements using a reporting configuration with the
_purpose_ set to \'_reportCGI_ \', if the network provides sufficient idle
periods.
The UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2, before using the
measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement
reporting.
The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> if a measurement gap configuration is setup; or
2> the UE does not require measurement gaps to perform the concerned
measurement:
3> if _s-Measure_ is not configured; or
3> if _s-Measure_ is configured and the serving cell RSRP, after layer 3
filtering, is lower than this value; or
3> if the _purpose_ for the associated _reportConfig_ is set to \'_reportCGI_
\':
4> perform the corresponding measurements of neighbouring cells on the
frequencies and RATs indicated in the concerned _measObject_ ;
2> perform the evaluation of reporting criteria as specified in section 5.5.4;
1> if a _measId_ is configuredfor which the _purpose_ within the associated
_reportConfig_ is set to \'_reportCGI\'_ :
2> try to acquire the global cell identity of the cell indicated by the
_cellForWhichToReportCGI_ in the associated _measObject_ by acquiring the
relevant system information from the concerned cell;
2> if the cell indicated by the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the
associated _measObject_ is an E-UTRAN cell:
3> try to acquire the list of additional PLMN Identities, as included in the
_plmn-IdentityList_ , if multiple PLMN identities are broadcast in the
concerned cell;
NOTE: The \'primary\' PLMN is part of the global cell identity.
2> if the cell indicated by the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the
associated _measObject_ is a UTRAN cell:
3> try to acquire the LAC, the RAC and the list of additional PLMN Identities,
if multiple PLMN identities are broadcast in the concerned cell;
2> if the cell indicated by the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the
associated _measObject_ is a GERAN cell:
3> try to acquire the RAC in the concerned cell;
2> if the cell indicated by the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the
associated _measObject_ is a CDMA2000 cell and the _cdma2000-Type_ included in
the _measObject_ is \'_typeHRPD_ \':
3> try to acquire the Sector ID in the concerned cell;
2> if the cell indicated by the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the
associated _measObject_ is a CDMA2000 cell and the _cdma2000-Type_ included in
the _measObject_ is \'_type1XRTT_ \':
3> try to acquire the BASE ID, SID and NID in the concerned cell;
#### 5.5.3.2 Layer 3 filtering
The UE shall:
1> for each measurement quantity that the UE performs measurements according
to 5.5.3.1:
2> filter the measured result, before using for evaluation of reporting
criteria or for measurement reporting, by the following formula:
$F_{n} = (1 - a) \cdot F_{n - 1} + a \cdot M_{n}$
> where
>
> **_M~n~_** is the latest received measurement result from the physical
> layer;
>
> **_F~n~_** is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for
> evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;
>
> **_F~n-1~_** is the old filtered measurement result, where **_F~0~_** is set
> to **_M~1~_** when the first measurement result from the physical layer is
> received; and
>
> **_a_** = 1/2^(**_k_** /4)^, where **_k_** is the _filterCoefficent_ for the
> corresponding measurement quantity received by the _quantityConfig;_
2> adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are
preserved at different input rates, observing that the _filterCoefficent_
**_k_** assumes a sample rate equal to 200 ms;
> NOTE 1: If **_k_** is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
>
> NOTE 2: The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation
> of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e., logarithmic
> filtering for logarithmic measurements.
NOTE 3: The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the
performance requirements set in [16]. For further details about the physical
layer measurements, see TS 36.133 [16].
### 5.5.4 Measurement report triggering
#### 5.5.4.1 General

1> for each _measId_ included in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> if the corresponding _reportConfig_ includes a purpose set to
\'_reportStrongestCellsForSON_ \':
3> consider any neighbouring cell detected on the associated frequency to be
applicable;
2> else if the corresponding _reportConfig_ includes a purpose set to
\'_reportCGI_ \':
3> consider any neighbouring cell detected on the associated frequency/ set of
frequencies (GERAN) which has a physical cell identity matching the value of
the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the corresponding _measObject_
within the _VarMeasConfig_ to be applicable;

4> consider a neighbouring cell on the associated frequency to be applicable
when the concerned cell is included in the _cellsToAddModList_ defined within
the _VarMeasConfig_ for this _measId_ (i.e. the cell is included in the white-
list);
3> else if the corresponding _measObject_ concerns GERAN:
4> consider a neighbouring cell on the associated set of frequencies to be
applicable when the concerned cell matches the _ncc-Permitted_ defined within
the _VarMeasConfig_ for this _measId_ ;

the _VarMeasReportList_ for this _measId_ ;
3> initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
2> if the _triggerType_ is set to \'_event_ \' and if the entry condition
applicable for this event, i.e. the event corresponding with the _eventId_ of
the corresponding _reportConfig_ within _VarMeasConfig_ , is fulfilled for one
or more applicable cells not included in the _cellsTriggeredList_ for all
measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during _timeToTrigger_ defined for
this event within the _VarMeasConfig_ (a subsequent cell triggers the event):
3> set the _numberOfReportsSent_ defined within the _VarMeasReportList_ for
this _measId_ to 0;
3> include the concerned cell(s) in the _cellsTriggeredList_ defined within
the _VarMeasReportList_ for this _measId_ ;
3> initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
2> if the _triggerType_ is set to \'_event_ \' and if the leaving condition
applicable for this event is fulfilled for one or more of the cells included
in the _cellsTriggeredList_ defined within the _VarMeasReportList_ for this
_measId_ for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during
_timeToTrigger_ defined within the _VarMeasConfig_ for this event:
3> remove the concerned cell(s) in the _cellsTriggeredList_ defined within the
_VarMeasReportList_ for this _measId_ ;
3> if _reportOnLeave_ is set to _TRUE_ for the corresponding reporting
configuration:

_measId_ is empty:
4> remove the measurement reporting entry within the _VarMeasReportList_ for
this _measId_ ;
4> stop the periodical reporting timer for this _measId_ , if running;
2> if the _purpose_ is included and set to \'_reportStrongestCells_ \' or to
\'_reportStrongestCellsForSON_ \' and if a (first) measurement result is
available for one or more applicable cells:

this _measId_ ;
3> set the _numberOfReportsSent_ defined within the _VarMeasReportList_ for
this _measId_ to 0;
3> initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
NOTE 1: If the _purpose_ is set to \'_reportStrongestCells_ \', the UE
initiates a first measurement report immediately after the quantity to be
reported becomes available for at least either serving cell or one of the
applicable cells. If the purpose is set to \'_reportStrongestCellsForSON_ \',
the UE initiates a first measurement report when it has determined the
strongest cells on the associated frequency.
2> upon expiry of the periodical reporting timer for this _measId_ :
3> initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;

NOTE 2: The UE does not stop the periodical reporting with _triggerType_ set
to \'_event_ \' or to \'_periodical_ \' while the corresponding measurement is
not performed due to the serving cell RSRP being equal to or better than _s-
Measure_ or due to the measurement gap not being setup.
NOTE 3: If the UE is configured with DRX, the UE may delay the measurement
reporting for event triggered and periodical triggered measurements until the
Active Time, which is defined in TS 36.321 [6].

### 5.5.5 Measurement reporting
Figure 5.5.5-1: Measurement reporting
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer measurement results from the UE
to E-UTRAN.
For the _measId_ for which the measurement reporting procedure was triggered,
the UE shall set the _measResults_ within the _MeasurementReport_ message as
follows:
1> set the _measId_ to the measurement identity that triggered the measurement
reporting;
1> set the _measResultServCell_ to include the quantities of serving cell;
1> if there is at least one applicable neighbouring cell to report:
2> set the _measResultNeighCells_ to include the best neighbouring cells up to
_maxReportCells_ in accordance with the following:
3> if the _triggerType_ is set to \'_event_ \':
4> include the cells included in the _cellsTriggeredList_ as defined within
the _VarMeasReportList_ for this _measId_ ;
3> else:
4> include the applicable cells for which the new measurement results became
available since the last periodical reporting or since the measurement was
initiated or reset;
NOTE: The reliability of the report (i.e. the certainty it contains the
strongest cells on the concerned frequency) depends on the measurement
configuration i.e. the _reportInterval_. The related performance requirements
are specified in TS 36.133 [16].
3> for each cell that is included in the _measResultNeighCells_ , include the
_physCellId_ ;
3> if the _triggerType_ is set to \'_event_ \'; or the _purpose_ is set to
\'_reportStrongestCells_ \' or to \'_reportStrongestCellsForSON_ \':
4> for each included cell, include the layer 3 filtered measured results in
accordance with the _reportConfig_ for this _measId_ , ordered as follows:
5> if the _measObject_ associated with this _measId_ concerns E-UTRA:
> 6> set the _measResult_ to include the quantity(ies) indicated in the
> _reportQuantity_ within the concerned _reportConfig_ in order of decreasing
> _triggerQuantity_ , i.e. the best cell is included first;
5> else:
> 6> set the _measResult_ to the quantity as configured for the concerned RAT
> within the _quantityConfig_ in order of either decreasing quantity for UTRA
> and GERAN or increasing quantity for CDMA2000 _pilotStrength_ , i.e. the
> best cell is included first;
3> else if the _purpose_ is set to \'_reportCGI_ \':
4> if the mandatory present fields of the _cgi-Info_ for the cell indicated by
the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ in the associated _measObject_ have been
obtained:
5> include the _cgi-Info_ containing all the fields that have been
successfully acquired;
1> increment the _numberOfReportsSent_ as defined within the
_VarMeasReportList_ for this _measId_ by 1;

this _measId_ is less than the _reportAmount_ as defined within the
corresponding _reportConfig_ for this _measId_ :
2> start the periodical reporting timer with the value of _reportInterval_ as
defined within the corresponding _reportConfig_ for this _measId_ ;
1> else:
2> if the _triggerType_ is set to \'_periodical_ \':
3> remove the entry within the _VarMeasReportList_ for this _measId_ ;
3> remove this _measId_ from the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ ;
1> if the measured results are for CDMA2000 HRPD:
2> set the _preRegistrationStatusHRPD_ to the UE\'s CDMA2000 upper layer\'s
HRPD _preRegistrationStatus_ ;
1> if the measured results are for CDMA2000 1xRTT:
2> set the  _preRegistrationStatusHRPD_ to \'_FALSE_ \';
1> submit the _MeasurementReport_ message to lower layers for transmission,
upon which the procedure ends;
### 5.5.6 Measurement related actions
#### 5.5.6.1 Actions upon handover and re-establishment
E-UTRAN applies the handover procedure as follows:
\- when performing the handover procedure, as specified in 5.3.5.4, ensure
that a _measObjectId_ corresponding to the handover target carrier frequency
is configured as a result of the procedures described in this sub-clause and
in 5.3.5.4;
\- when changing the band while the physical frequency remains unchanged,
E-UTRAN releases the _measObject_ corresponding to the source frequency and
adds a _measObject_ corresponding to the target frequency (i.e. it does not
reconfigure the _measObject_);
E-UTRAN applies the re-establishment procedure as follows:
\- when performing the connection re-establishment procedure, as specified in
5.3.7, ensure that a _measObjectId_ corresponding to the target carrier
frequency is configured as a result of the procedure described in this sub-
clause and the subsequent connection reconfiguration procedure immediately
following the re-establishment procedure;
\- in the first reconfiguration following the re-establishment when changing
the band while the physical frequency remains unchanged, E-UTRAN releases the
_measObject_ corresponding to the source frequency and adds a _measObject_
corresponding to the target frequency (i.e. it does not reconfigure the
_measObject_);
The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> if the _triggerType_ is set to \'_periodical_ \':
3> remove this _measId_ from the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
1> if the procedure was triggered due to inter-frequency handover or
successful re-establishment to an inter-frequency cell, update the _measId_
values in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ as follows:
2> if a _measObjectId_ value corresponding to the target carrier frequency
exists in the _measObjectList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
3> for each _measId_ value in the _measIdList_ :
4> if the _measId_ value is linked to the _measObjectId_ value corresponding
to the source carrier frequency:
5> link this _measId_ value to the _measObjectId_ value corresponding to the
target carrier frequency;
4> else if the _measId_ value is linked to the _measObjectId_ value
corresponding to the target carrier frequency:
5> link this _measId_ value to the _measObjectId_ value corresponding to the
source carrier frequency;
2> else:
3> remove all _measId_ values that are linked to the _measObjectId_ value
corresponding to the source carrier frequency;
1> remove all measurement reporting entries within _VarMeasReportList_ ;
1> reset the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is
running, as well as associated information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for all
_measId_ ;
1> release the measurement gaps, if activated;
NOTE: If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency or inter-
RAT measurements, the UE resumes the inter-frequency and inter-RAT
measurements after the E-UTRAN has setup the measurement gaps.
#### 5.5.6.2 Speed dependant scaling of measurement related parameters
The UE shall adjust the value of the following parameter configured by the
E-UTRAN depending on the UE speed: _timeToTrigger_. The UE shall apply 3
different levels, which are selected as follows:
The UE shall:
1> perform mobility state detection using the mobility state detection as
specified in TS 36.304 [4] with the following modifications:
2> counting handovers instead of cell reselections;
2> applying the parameter applicable for RRC_CONNECTED as included in
_speedStatePars_ within _VarMeasConfig;_
> 1> if high mobility state is detected:
2> use the _timeToTrigger_ value multiplied by _sf-High_ within
_VarMeasConfig_ ;
> 1> else if medium mobility state is detected:
2> use the _timeToTrigger_ value multiplied by _sf-Medium_ within
_VarMeasConfig_ ;
1> else
> 2> no scaling is applied;

## 5.7 Generic error handling
### 5.7.1 General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent sub-clauses applies
unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error
handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
\- to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer
syntax supported by the UE.
\- to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific
behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved
value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
\- as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour
that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved field.
### 5.7.2 ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1> when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, PCCH or CCCH for which the
abstract syntax is invalid [13]:
2> ignore the message;
NOTE This section applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other
than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the
transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined
as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably
detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message
level.
### 5.7.3 Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1> if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not
comprehend:
2> if a default value is defined for this field:
3> treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2> else if the concerned field is optional:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the
need code for absence of the concerned field;
2> else:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with sub-
clause 5.7.4;
### 5.7.4 Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1> if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message
(e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field
is absent or treated as absent:
2> if the RRC message was received on DCCH or CCCH:
3> ignore the message;
2> else:
3> if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE
OF):
4> treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended
field was not present;
3> else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the
\'parent\' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the
erroneous field:
4> consider the \'parent\' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4> apply the generic error handling to the subsequent \'parent\' field(s),
until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3> else (field at message level):
4> ignore the message;
NOTE: The error handling defined in these sub-clauses implies that the UE
ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended
value.
### 5.7.5 Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1> if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2> treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent;
NOTE: This section does not apply to the case of an extension to the value
range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in
section 5.7.3.
# 6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters (tabular & ASN.1)
## 6.1 General
The contents of each RRC message is specified in sub-clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to
specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further
detailed information about the information elements specified in the message
syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone
abstract types is further specified in a similar manner in sub-clause 6.3.
The need for information elements to be present in a message or an abstract
type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract
notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the
OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available
for use in the downlink direction only. The meaning of each tag is specified
in table 6.1-1.
Table 6.1-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for information
elements to be present
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Abbreviation | Meaning | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Cond _conditionTag_ | _Conditionally present_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | An information element for which the need | | | is specified by means of conditions. For | | | each _conditionTag_ , the need is | | | specified in a tabular form following the | | | ASN.1 segment.

For downlink messages, the UE | | | is not required to take any special | | | action on absence of the IE beyond what | | | is specified in the procedural text or | | | the field description table following the | | | ASN.1 segment. The UE behaviour on | | | absence should be captured either in the | | | procedural text or in the field | | | description. | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Need ON | _Optionally present, No action_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | An information element that is optional | | | to signal. _If the message is received by | | | the UE, and_ in case the information | | | element is absent, the UE takes no action | | | and where applicable shall continue to | | | use the existing value (and/ or the | | | associated functionality). | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Need OR | _Optionally present, Release_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | An information element that is optional | | | to signal. _If the message is received by | | | the UE, and_ in case the information | | | element is absent, the UE shall | | | discontinue/ stop using/ delete any | | | existing value (and/ or the associated | | | functionality). | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
Any IE with Need ON in system information shall be interpreted as Need OR.

to the default CQI/ SRS/ SR configuration in accordance with subclause 5.3.13
and TS 36.321 [6, 5.9 & 5.2]. Hence, for these parts of the dedicated radio

# 8 Protocol data unit abstract syntax
# 8.1 General
The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using abstract
syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [13] and X.681
[14]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by
use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [15].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in
X.691:
\- When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to
15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the
leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value
shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field.
NOTE: The terms \'leading bit\' and \'trailing bit\' are defined in ITU-T Rec.
X.680. When using the \'bstring\' notation, the leading bit of the bit string
value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the
right.
## 8.2 Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer entities/
across the radio interface contains the basic production as defined in X.691.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC SDUs
(in case of PCCH, BCCH or CCCH) upon transmission and reception as follows:
\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for
transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first
bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and
\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission,
the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC
SDU and onwards; and
\- upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the
PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and
\- upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC
SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
## 8.3 Basic production
The \'basic production\' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract
syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It always contains
a multiple of 8 bits.
## 8.4 Extension
The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:
\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall,
unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension
part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send non-empty
extensions;
\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set
spare bits to zero;
## 8.5 Padding
If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer
shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.
Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple of
8.

## 9.2 Default radio configurations
NOTE: Value \"N/A\" indicates that the UE does not apply a specific value
(i.e. upon switching to a default configuration, E-UTRAN can not assume the UE
keeps the previously configured value). This implies that E-UTRAN needs to
configure a value before invoking the related functionality.

# 10 Radio information related interactions between network nodes
## 10.1 General
This section specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network
nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another
Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar
characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the E-UTRA
radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension
mechanisms apply.
## 10.2 Inter-node RRC messages
### 10.2.1 General
This section specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2- or the
S1-interface, either to or from the eNB, i.e. a single 'logical channel' is
used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information
could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
Editor's note No agreements have been reached concerning the extension of RRC
PDUs so far. Any statements in this section about the protocol extension
mechanism should be considered as FFS.
## A.1 Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol
data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
## A.2 Procedural specification
### A.2.1 General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description
regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception
of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU
specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details
of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be
done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU section e.g.
general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple
fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements
regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are send to E-UTRAN
i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
### A.2.2 More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
\- Bullets:
\- Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the
procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are
part of the sentence starting with \'The UE shall:\'
\- All bullets, including the last one in a sub-clause, should end with a
semi-colon i.e. an \';\'
\- Conditions
\- Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end
of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in \'if cond1;
or cond2:
## A.3 PDU specification
### A.3.1 General principles
#### A.3.1.1 ASN.1 sections
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract
syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [13], X.681 (02/2002) [14].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the
specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1
code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with a text paragraph
consisting entirely of an _ASN.1 start tag_ , which consists of a double
hyphen followed by a single space and the text string \"ASN1START\" (in all
upper case letters). Each ASN.1 section ends with a text paragraph consisting
entirely of an _ASN.1 stop tag_ , which consists of a double hyphen followed
by a single space and the text \"ASN1STOP\" (in all upper case letters):
\-- ASN1START
\-- ASN1STOP
The text paragraphs containing the ASN.1 start and stop tags should not
contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU
contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text
paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the
order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE: A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists
of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the
entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed
by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the
occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
#### A.3.1.2 ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should
be based on the following guidelines:
\- Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without
hyphenation. These identifiers, _e.g._ , the
_RRCConnectionModificationCommand_ , should be used for reference in the
procedure text. Abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
\- Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case,
with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a
capital, _e.g._ , _EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since
the \"d\" in \"Selected\" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-
TimeDifference_.
\- Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case
thereafter, _e.g._ , _establishmentCause_. If a field identifier begins with
an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is
lowercase (_plmn-Identity_ , not _pLMN-Identity_). The acronym is set off with
a hyphen (_ue-Identity_ , not _ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a
consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers_.
\- Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially
widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent
possible.
\- Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should
be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which
should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use \'Meas\' instead of
\'Measurement\' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are
given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
\- _For future extension:_ When an extension is introduced a suffix is added
to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/ or type. A suffix of the
form \"â€‘rX\" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types
introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/ first
release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a
revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, _e.g._
, _Foo-r9_ for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type _Foo_. A suffix of the form
\"â€‘vXYZ\" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a
corresponding earlier field or type (see sub-clause A.4), e.g.,
_AnElement-v10b0_ for the extension of the ASN.1 type _AnElement_ introduced
in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number _0...9, 10, 11, etc._ is
used to represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release
of the protocol. Lower case letters _a, b, c, etc._ are used to represent the
second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9.
\- More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants
of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the
identifiers e.g. _MeasObjectUTRAN_ , _ConfigCommon_. When there is no
particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included
in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be
attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the
different variants.

* * *
NOTE: The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be
used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
#### A.3.1.3 Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the
specification is made using the ASN.1 field or type identifier of the
referenced element. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text
references should be in the _italic font style_. The \"do not check spelling
and grammar\" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., \" \")
should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU type should be made using the corresponding ASN.1
type identifier followed by the word \"message\", e.g., a reference to the
_RRCConnectionRelease_ message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any
other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field
identifier followed by the word \"field\", e.g., a reference to the
_prioritisedBitRate_ field in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority Priority,
prioritisedBitRate PrioritisedBitRate,
bucketSizeDuration BucketSizeDuration,
logicalChannelGroup INTEGER (0..3)
} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
NOTE: All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples in this
annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to
include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted
from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym \"IE\", e.g., a
reference to the IE _LogicalChannelConfig_ in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when
those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the
specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a
particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information
element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be
used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 value while using quotation marks (i.e., \" \") around the
ASN.1 value, e.g., \'if the _status_ field is set to value \"_true_ \"\'.
### A.3.2 High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are
alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
message DL-DCCH-MessageType
}
DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE {
dlInformationTransfer DLInformationTransfer,
handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
mobilityFromEUTRACommand MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
rrcConnectionReconfiguration RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
rrcConnectionRelease RRCConnectionRelease,
securityModeCommand SecurityModeCommand,
ueCapabilityEnquiry UECapabilityEnquiry,
spare1 NULL
},
messageClassExtension SEQUENCE {}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types
are alternatives within the inner level _c1_ CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare1_ in this case) may be included within the
_c1_ CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare
alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an
integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using
the _messageClassExtension_ alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
### A.3.3 Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one
shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8 RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the IEs here.
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Hooks for _critical_ and _non-critical_ extension should normally be included
in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described
in sub-clause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents
and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between
the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented
from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not
comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE
structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the
inner level _c1_ CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare3_ down to _spare1_
in this case) may be included within the _c1_ CHOICE. The number of spare
alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be
decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the
future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original
specifications are used up, is facilitated using the
_criticalExtensionsFuture_ in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases
of the protocol, the inner level _c1_ CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be
excluded, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the IEs here. -- -- Cond condTag
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information
to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-
critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still
able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or
other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are
facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker \"...\". The original
specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at
the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field
that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of an empty
sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2,
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL -- Need OP
}
\-- ASN1STOP
_The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a
field description table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic
properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is
shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case
there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g.
because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for
each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that
needs to be specified._
+-------------------------------------------+ | _%PDU-TypeIdentifier% field descriptions_ | +-------------------------------------------+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+
The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the
ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall
include a first paragraph with a _field identifier_ (in **_bold and italic_**
font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The
following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style),
e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/ or
specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of
the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be
omitted from the field description table.
### A.3.4 Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to
the one shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-ConfigSIB ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo
}
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need ON
}
PRACH-ConfigInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
prach-ConfigIndex ENUMERATED {ffs},
highSpeedFlag ENUMERATED {ffs},
zeroCorrelationZoneConfig ENUMERATED {ffs}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same
set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break
down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs _PRACH-ConfigSIB_
and _PRACH-Config_ in this example, are preferably placed together in a common
ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base,
defined as the _generic type identifier_. It may be complemented by a suffix
to distinguish the different variants. The \"_PRACH-Config_ \" is the generic
type identifier in this example, and the \"_SIB_ \" suffix is added to
distinguish the variant. The sub-clause heading and generic references to a
group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type
identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of
an existing IE is created for _critical_ or _non-critical_ extension of the
protocol (see sub-clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of
the IE is included in the same ASN.1 section defining the original. A suffix
is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in sub-
clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new
version, or extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ in the example
above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the other IE
types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally defined IE types
should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type
definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a
benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these
IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data
elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ , should
not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC specification.
An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 section should be
defined in a separate sub-clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1
section (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs
_PRACH-ConfigSIB_ and _PRACH-Config_ in the example above). Such IE types are
also referred to as \'global IEs\'.
NOTE: Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the
context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation
error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE
type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline
level of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the
example above, may be followed by a _field description_ table, where a further
description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information
elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in
sub-clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of
the _field description_ table is the same as shown in sub-clause A.3.3 for the
specification of the PDU type.
### A.3.5 Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It
identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a
value for that field in the encoding:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PreambleInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
numberOfRA-Preambles INTEGER (1..64) DEFAULT 1,
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword
OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission
carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need ON
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted,
should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword
OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need statement. The need statement
includes the keyword \"Need\", followed by one of the predefined semantics
tags (OP, ON or OR) defined in sub-clause 6.1. If the semantics tag OP is
used, the semantics of the absent field are further specified either in the
field description table following the ASN.1 section, or in procedure text.
### A.3.6 Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In
addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph
including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword
\"Cond\", followed by a condition tag associated with the field (\"UL\" in
this example):
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority INTEGER (0),
...
} OPTIONAL -- Cond UL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the field
description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a _conditional
presence_ table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for
including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1
section.
* * *
_Conditional presence_ _Explanation_ UL **Specification of the conditions for
including the field associated with the condition tag = \"UL\". Semantics in
case of optional presence under certain conditions may also be specified.**
* * *
The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading:
\"Conditional presence\") contains the condition tag (in _italic_ font style),
which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 section to an entry
in the table. The second column (heading: \"Explanation\") contains a text
specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the
field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional
presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined
tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional presence,
the conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of
conditional presence should be considered.
### A.3.7 Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct
in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an
information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would
not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in
the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo
PLMN-IdentityInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code
to contain types with unpredictable names:
\-- /bad example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
## A.4 Extension of the PDU specifications
### A.4.1 General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect
interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different
versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this
requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
\- Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected
behaviour or damage).
\- Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should be
possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of
the other parts of the message).
\- Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If used,
the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical
channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may
be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring
of extensions may not be required.
The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing
protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when
there is a need to introduce a \'clean\' message version. Such a need appears
when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical
extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with
the extension markers. The critical extension mechanism may also be considered
when it is complicated to accomodate the extensions by means of non-critical
extension mechanisms.
### A.4.2 Critical extension of messages
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are
both \"outer branch\" and \"inner branch\" mechanisms available. The \"outer
branch\" consists of a CHOICE having the name _criticalExtensions_ , with two
values, _c1_ and _criticalExtensionsFuture_. The _criticalExtensionsFuture_
branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the \"inner
branch\" mechanism.
The \"inner branch\" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form
\"_MessageName-rX-IEs_ \" (e.g., \"_RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs_ \")
or \"_spareX_ \", with the spare values having type NULL. The \"-rX-IEs\"
structures contain the _complete_ structure of the message IEs for the
appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10
version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not
obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional
Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to
introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an \'outer branch\', or an
\'outer branch\' in combination with an \'inner branch\' including a certain
number of spares:
\- For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on
a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
\- An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
\- The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that
the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release
with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values).
The estimation of the critical extension likelyhood may be based on the
number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
\- In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all
spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions
are added using the outer branch.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism
by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Original release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,

spare7 NULL, spare6 NULL, spare5 NULL, spare4 NULL,

},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
### A.4.3 Non-critical extension of messages
#### A.4.3.1 General principles
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in
A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional
guidelines apply:
\- When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been
critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier
critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.
\- The extension marker (\"...\") is the primary non-critical extension
mechanism that is used unless a length determinant is not required. Examples
of cases where a length determinant is not required:
\- at the end of a message,
\- at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING
\- When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are
preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter
belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the \'_default
extension location_ \')
\- It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of
the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible
level.
\- In specific cases it may be preferrable to place extensions elsewhere
(referred to as the \'_actual extension location_ \') e.g. when it is possible
to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should
be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message. \
\- In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier
critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher
level in the message should be considered.
\- In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE
should be defined. The IE\'s ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same
ASN.1 section as the default extension location. In case there are
intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension location,
an IE may be defined for each level. \
#### A.4.3.2 Further guidelines
Further to the general principles defined in the previous section, the
following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:
\- Extension markers within SEQUENCE
\- Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the
higher nesting levels
\- Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields
as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex
structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list)
\- Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important
information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT
\- Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages
on BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully
\- The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the
specification are grouped together within a SEQUENCE type. The group may
consist of a single field.
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ-IEs\" is used for the type identifier of the
SEQUENCE type used to group extension fields.
\- Although the group as a whole is marked as OPTIONAL, a \"Need\" statement
may not be provided. In case a need statement is not provided for the group, a
\"Need\" statement is provided for all individual extension fields within the
group i.e. including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is
to clarify the action upon absence of the whole group.
\- Extension markers within ENUMERATED
\- Spare values are used until the number of values reaches the next power of
2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new value,
e.g. \"value-vXYZ\".
\- Extension markers within CHOICE:
\- Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when
comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for
the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g.
ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the
behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not
required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the
extended value.
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new choice
value, e.g. \"choice-vXYZ\".
There are no additional guidelines w.r.t. the use of non-critical extensions
at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an OCTET or BIT STRING.
#### A.4.3.3 Typical example of evolution of IE with _local_ extensions
The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number
of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also
illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism
is used.
NOTE In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while
the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the the release
n receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced
mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.
\-- /example/ ASN1START

}
InformationElement1-v1170-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field3-v1170 InformationElement3-v1170 OPTIONAL -- Need OR
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions of _InformationElement1_ as shown in the
above example:
\-- The _InformationElement1_ is initially extended with a number of non-
critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced
for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE
_InformationElement1_ (i.e. _InformationElement1-r10_) is defined in which the
earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the
original field.
\-- The _value4-v880_ is replacing a spare value defined in the original
protocol version for _field1_. Likewise _value6-v1170_ replaces _spare3_ that
was originally defined in the r10 version of _field1_
\-- Within the critically extended release 10 version of _InformationElement1_
, the names of the original fields/ IEs are not changed, unless there is a
real need to distinguish them from other fields/ IEs. E.g. the _field1_ and
_InformationElement4_ were defined in the original protocol version (release
8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the _field3-r9_ is introduced in release 9
and not re-tagged; although, the _InformationElement3_ is also critically
extended and therefore tagged _InformationElement3-r10_ in the release 10
version of InformationElement1.
#### A.4.3.4 Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a
message
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the
end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or
OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.
\-- /example/ ASN1START

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The _InformationElement4_ is introduced in the original version of the
protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
#### A.4.3.5 Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default
extension location
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case
an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
#### \-- _ParentIE-WithEM_
The IE _ParentIE-WithEM_ is an example of a high level IE including the
extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level
IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM_ which not include the
extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have
to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.
The example illustrates how the two extension IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0_
and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0_ (both in release N) are used to connect non-
critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs
to the actual extension location in this IE.

}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The the fields _childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0_ may not really need to be
optional (depends on what is defined at the next lower level).
#### \-- _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_
The IE _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ is an example of a lower level IE, used to control
certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be
setup or released using the local IE _ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature_. The example
illustrates how the new field _chIE1-NewField_ is added in release N to the
configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the
following assumptions:
\-- when initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the
original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as
if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.
\-- when the configurable feature is released, the new field should be
released also.
\-- when omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE
continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling
for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).
\-- when omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases
the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may
be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an
eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).
The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may
not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.

## A.5 Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC
messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a
Transaction identifier
1: DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the RRC
transaction identifier.
2: All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC
transaction identifier.
3: All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC
Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4: All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an
RRC transaction identifier.
5: All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a
corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction
identifier.
## A.6 Protection of RRC messages (informative)
The following list provides information which messages can be sent
(unprotected) prior to security activation and which messages can be sent
unprotected after security activation.
P...Messages that can be sent (unprotected) prior to security activation
A - I...Messages that can be sent without integrity protection after security
activation
A - C...Messages that can be sent unciphered after security activation
NA... Message can never be sent after security activation

###### ## Annex B (normative): Release 8 AS feature handling
## B.1 Feature group indicators
This annex contains the definitions of the bits in field
_featureGroupIndicators_.
In this release of the protocol, the UE shall include the field
_featureGroupIndicators_ in the IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability_. All the
functionalities defined within the field _featureGroupIndicators_ defined in
Table B.1-1 are mandatory for the UE, if the related capability (frequency
band, RAT or SR-VCC) is also supported. For a specific indicator, if all
functionalities for a feature group listed in Table B.1-1 have been
implemented and tested, the UE shall set the indicator as one (1), else (i.e.
if any one of the functionalities in a feature group listed in Table B.1-1,
which have not been implemented or tested), the UE shall set the indicator as
zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators, which do not have a definition in the table
B.1-1, as zero.
If the optional field _featureGroupIndicators_ is not included by UE
supporting future release, the network may assume that UE supports all
features listed in Table B.1-1 and deployed in the network.

**Clarification for mobility from EUTRAN and inter-frequency handover within
EUTRAN**
There are several feature groups related to mobility from E-UTRAN and inter-
frequency handover within EUTRAN. The description of these features is based
on the assumption that we have 5 main \"functions\" related to mobility from
E-UTRAN:
A. Support of measurements and cell reselection procedure in idle mode
B. Support of RRC release with redirection procedure in connected mode
C. Support of Network Assisted Cell Change in connected mode
D. Support of measurements and reporting in connected mode
E. Support of handover procedure in connected mode
All functions can be applied for mobility to Inter-frequency to EUTRAN, GERAN,
UTRAN, CDMA2000 HRPD and CDMA2000 1xRTT except for function C) which is only
applicable for mobility to GERAN. Table B.1-2 below summarises the mobility
functions that are supported based on the UE capability signaling (band
support) and the setting of the feature group support indicators.

a blind fashion.
## B.2 CSG support
In this release of the protocol, it is mandatory for the UE to support a
minimum set of CSG functionality consisting of:
\- Identifying whether a cell is CSG or not;
\- Ignoring CSG cells in cell selection/reselection.
Additional CSG functionality in AS, i.e. the requirement to detect and camp on
CSG cells when the \"allowed CSG list\" is available or when manual CSG
selection is triggered by the user, are related to the corresponding NAS
features. This additional AS functionality consists of:
\- Manual CSG selection;
\- Autonomous CSG search;
\- Implicit priority handling for cell reselection with CSG cells.
It is possible that this additional CSG functionality in AS is not supported
or tested in early UE implementations.
Note that since the above AS features relate to idle mode operations, the
capability support is not signalled to the network. For these reasons, no
\"feature group indicator\" is assigned to this feature to indicate early
support in Rel-8.
