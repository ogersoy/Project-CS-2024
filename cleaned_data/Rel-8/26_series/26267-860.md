# Introduction
eCall refers to an interoperable in-vehicle emergency call service which is
envisioned to be introduced and operated across Europe in 2014. According to
reports from the European Commission, it is foreseen that eCall will be
offered on all new vehicles in the EU by 2014.
The European Commission has brought together standardization bodies, the
automotive industry, mobile telecommunication industry, public emergency
authorities and others in the eSafety Forum initiative which has identified
high-level requirements, recommendations and guidelines for this eCall service
[9] and [10]. The eSafety Forum has assigned ETSI MSG to standardize those
parts of the eCall service that affect the mobile communication system. The
development of the eCall standard has been further delegated to the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the eCall In-band Modem, which is used for
reliable transmission of the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD) from an In-
Vehicle System (IVS) to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) via the voice
channel of cellular and PSTN networks.
The European Union eCall requirements, recommendations and guidelines were
developed by eSafety Forum [10] and [11], with important additional work
produced by ETSI MSG, GSME, 3GPP, and CEN.
Previous work in 3GPP TR 22.967 [3] \"Transfer of Emergency Call Data\",
examined the issues associated with the transmission of emergency call data
from a vehicle to a PSAP. This analysis identified that the preferred option
be based on an in-band modem solution.
eCall provides reliable full-duplex data communications between IVS and PSAP
in addition to emergency voice call (E112) via the cellular network, and can
be initiated either automatically or manually [1]. The eCall In-band Modem
uses the same voice channel as used for the emergency voice call. eCall allows
reliable transmission of MSD alternating with a speech conversation through
the existing voice communication paths in cellular mobile phone systems. The
expected benefit is that emergency services will be made aware of accidents
much more rapidly, will get precise information on location, vehicle type etc.
and therefore will be able to reach accident victims faster, with the
potential to save many lives annually.
The eCall in-band modem solution described here exceeds the eCall requirements
(see Annex A) by means of a combination of innovations in data modulation
scheme, synchronization, forward error correction coding, hybrid ARQ (HARQ)
and incremental redundancy transmission.
The present document provides a general overview and algorithm description of
the eCall in-band modems, including IVS modem and PSAP modem, to form the
complete full-duplex transmission.
The eCall in-band modems (IVS and PSAP) are fully specified by this TS
together with the C-code reference as provided in 3GPP TS 26.268 [2].
3GPP TS 26.269 [13] deals with the conformance testing for eCall modem
implementations, and 3GPP TR 26.969 [14] contains a characterization report of
the in-band modem.

# 4 General overview
## 4.1 eCall system overview
The eCall system overview is depicted in Figure 1.
Figure 1: eCall system overview [11]
In the event of a vehicle collision, the eCall in-band modem solution is used
in an automatically or manually established emergency voice call (E112) from
the vehicle (IVS) via the cellular network to the local emergency agencies,
i.e. the PSAP. The eCall modem allows to transfer a data message from the IVS
over the cellular network to the PSAP which is denoted as eCall MSD. The MSD
can include, e.g. vehicle location information, time stamp, number of
passengers, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and other relevant accident
information.
It is expected that the eCall MSD information will be sent either immediately
following the establishment of the voice call or at any point later during the
voice call. The integrity of the eCall data sent from the vehicle to the PSAP
is ensured by the specified modem.
eCall is a European regional requirement. It shall not have an impact on the
global circulation of terminals.
## 4.2 eCall system requirements
The eCall service requirements have been defined in 3GPP TS 22.101 [1], and
are reproduced here for information. Not all of the requirements apply to the
eCall modem specification in this document.
\- The data may be sent prior to, in parallel with, or at the start of the
voice component of an emergency call.
\- Should the PSAP request additional data then this may be possible during
the established emergency call.
\- The realisation of the transfer of data during an emergency call shall
minimise changes to the originating and transit networks.
\- Both the voice and data components of the emergency call shall be routed to
the same PSAP or designated emergency call centre.
\- The transmission of the data shall be acknowledged and if necessary data
shall be retransmitted.
\- A UE configured only to transfer data during emergency calls (e.g. eCall
only UE) shall not generate signalling to the network besides what is needed
to place an emergency call.
\- The UE shall indicate at call setup if the emergency call will carry
supplementary data.
The following specific requirements are considered necessary for the
satisfactory operation of the eCall service. Additionally, all existing TS12
emergency call requirements shall apply.
\- An eCall shall consist of a TS12 emergency call supplemented by a minimum
set of emergency related data (MSD).
\- An eCall may be initiated automatically, for example due to a vehicle
collision, or manually by the vehicle occupants.
\- An IVS, or other UE designed to support eCall functionality, shall include
in the emergency call set-up an indication that the present call is either a
Manually Initiated eCall (MIeC) or an Automatically Initiated eCall (AIeC).
\- The Minimum Set of Data (MSD) sent by the In vehicle System (IVS) to the
network shall not exceed 140 bytes.
\- The MSD should typically be made available to the PSAP within 4 seconds,
measured from the time when end to end connection with the PSAP is
established.
\- Should the MSD component not be included in an eCall, or is corrupted or
lost for any reason, then this shall not affect the associated TS12 emergency
call speech functionality.
\- A call progress indication shall be provided to the user whilst the MSD
transmission is in progress.
\- To reduce the time taken to establish an eCall an IVS whilst in eCall only
mode, may receive network availability information whilst not registered on a
PLMN.
\- Optionally, PLMNs may make use of eCall indicators, received in the
emergency call set-up, to differentiate eCalls from other TS12 emergency
calls.
\- The MIeC and AIeC may be used to filter or route eCalls to a dedicated PSAP
operators.
Throughout the duration of the emergency call and following receipt of the MSD
by the PSAP
\- It shall be possible for the PSAP to send a confirmation to the IVS that
the MSD has been acted upon.
\- It shall be possible for the PSAP to request the IVS to re-send its most
recent MSD.
\- It shall be possible for the PSAP to instruct the IVS to terminate the
eCall.
For the purpose of selecting the best performing eIM solution, these service
requirements have been further clarified, and performance objectives under
different radio channel conditions as well as design constraints are defined
in Annex A.
## 4.3 eCall in-band modem architecture
It is a challenging task to transmit data over the mobile voice channel as
required of an in-band modem since speech codecs used in digital cellular
systems are optimized explicitly for speech signal compression. Therefore,
modem signals may incur heavy distortion after passing through the effective
transmission channel consisting of speech codec, possible degradations on the
radio channel, and speech decoder with error concealment. Furthermore, in
digital cellular communications frame losses occur regularly and increase the
burden of data recovery by the in-band modem.
CTM was developed in 3GPP for transmitting text data for text telephony. It
was evaluated as a potential solution for eIM in the technical report (3GPP TR
26.967 [4]) and found not able to meet eCall requirements.
The present eIM solution consists of an IVS data modem and a PSAP data modem,
employing signals that have been designed to pass through modern speech codecs
with only moderate distortion, yet providing sufficiently high data rates for
quick MSD transmission.
The overall cellular system architecture, including the IVS and PSAP data
modems, is given for information in a simplified diagram in Figure 2.
After an emergency voice call has been (automatically or manually)
established, the IVS modem receiver constantly monitors the incoming signal
from the speech decoder output. When prompted by a request from the PSAP
operator for MSD, the IVS connects the IVS data modem transmitter to the input
of the speech coder and mutes any speech from the motorist for the duration of
MSD transmission to prevent it from interfering with the eCall data
transmission. Alternatively, it can be the IVS that may trigger the MSD
transmission. In this case, the IVS asks the PSAP to request an MSD
transmission.
The first operation mode shall be referred to as the _pull_ mode whereas the
latter one is the _push_ mode. Essentially, push mode is realized by a request
from the IVS to the PSAP to _pull_ the MSD.
The requirement about the modem to be configured in either _push_ or _pull_
mode is beyond the scope of this specification. Refer to clause 4.2 for a
reproduction of eCall service requirements.
In general, the mircophone has to be detached from the signal path whenever
the eCall modem is actively transmitting.
The operational principles of the IVS and PSAP modems within the environment
illustrated in Figure 1 are further explained in the following. Details of the
employed algorithms and functions are given in clauses 5 and 6.
Figure 2: eCall system within the cellular system architecture
### 4.3.1 Principle operation of the IVS data modem
The main components of the IVS data modem are illustrated in Figure 3. The MSD
information input into the IVS transmitter is first appended with CRC
information. These bits are then encoded in the hybrid ARQ (HARQ) encoder
using FEC coding to reduce the susceptibility to transmission errors. The HARQ
encoder employs a powerful state-of-the-art turbo encoding scheme with
incremental redundancy added for each retransmission. The signal modulator
converts the encoded data into waveform symbols which are especially suitable
for transmission through speech codecs employed in present mobile systems,
including the GSM Full-Rate (3GPP TS 46.001 [5]) and the various modes of AMR
codecs (3GPP TS 26.071 [7]).
The IVS receiver continues to monitor the feedback messages from the PSAP data
modem. As long as the received feedback messages are NACK messages,
retransmissions of the MSD with incremental redundancy are automatically
continued until a sufficient number of link-layer ACK or higher-layer ACK
messages has been received by the IVS, or operation is terminated by the PSAP.
After the transmission of the MSD information and the ACK messages is
completed, the eCall modem transmitters in both the IVS and PSAP return to
idle state and the signal paths from the transmitters are switched off to
avoid interference with the normal voice call.
In _push_ mode, the IVS reuses the downlink message format for requesting the
PSAP to _pull_ the MSD. Request messages are transmitted until the IVS
receiver detects START messages from the PSAP or a timeout occurs. Upon
detection of the START messages the IVS continues as if it was in _pull_ mode.
This document only specifies the eCall modem for the transmission of one MSD
of length 140 bytes. Messages shorter than 140 bytes are assumed to have been
padded, e.g., with zeros before being fed to the IVS transmitter. Longer
message lengths would require a packet segmentation mechanism as well as
adaptations to the transmission protocol, which are out of scope for this
document.
Figure 3: eCall IVS data modem overview
### 4.3.2 Principle operation of the PSAP data modem
The main components of the PSAP data modem are illustrated in Figure 4. After
having triggered the IVS data modem for transmission of MSD, the eCall PSAP
receiver continuously monitors the incoming signal from the PSTN. When the
eCall data signal is detected and synchronized, the signal demodulator
demodulates the incoming data symbols. The HARQ decoder soft-combines the
first MSD transmission with any retransmissions of the information and decodes
the FEC to determine the information bits, i.e. its estimate of the CRC
protected MSD information. If a CRC error is detected in the decoded MSD, the
PSAP receiver returns NACK and thereby prompts the IVS transmitter to provide
retransmissions with incremental redundancy. Otherwise, the MSD information is
provided to the PSAP operator and the IVS transmitter is notified with link-
layer or higher-layer ACK messages that retransmissions are no longer
required.
In _push_ mode, the PSAP monitors the received signal for a trigger from the
IVS. Upon detection of a trigger it transmits a request for MSD transmission
as it would do in _pull_ mode and continues as described above.
The outgoing speech path is switched off when the PSAP transmitter needs to
use the voice channel for feedback messages. Once the MSD is correctly
received and the ACK messages are transmitted, the speech path is unmuted to
avoid interference with the normal voice call.
Figure 4: eCall PSAP data modem overview
# 5 Functional description of the IVS data modem
This clause describes the different functions of the IVS data modem.
## 5.1 IVS transmitter
The IVS transmitter modulates the MSD data to generate signals suitable for
transmission over the in-band voice channel to the PSAP. The different blocks
of the IVS transmitter are shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: IVS transmitter block diagram
### 5.1.1 MSD Message
The MSD is represented by a field of 140 bytes (1 120 bits).
The MSD is denoted $a_{i},$ $i = 1,\ \cdots,\ \text{1120}$.
### 5.1.2 CRC code
Each MSD message is appended by a field of 28 bit CRC code prior to HARQ FEC
encoding.
The entire MSD of length _K_ = 1120 bits is used to calculate the CRC parity
bits. The length of the CRC protected code word is _N_ = 1148. Then _N_ âˆ’ _K_
= 28 denotes the degree of the generator polynomial.
The parity bits are generated by the following cyclic generator polynomial:
Denote the bits in the MSD by
$a_{1},a_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{K}$ and the parity bits by
$p_{1},p_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},p_{\text{28}}$.
The encoding is performed in a systematic form, which means that in GF(2), the
polynomial
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC28~(_D_).
### 5.1.3 HARQ FEC encoder
HARQ FEC encoding includes bit scrambling, turbo coding, and the HARQ scheme.
#### 5.1.3.1 Bit scrambling
Bit scrambling is applied to the CRC appended MSD prior to turbo encoding:
$a_{s}(i) = a_{\text{crc}}(i)$ XOR $b_{\text{scm}}(i),\ i =
0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\text{1147}$
Where $a_{\text{crc}}$ is the MSD and CRC bitstream, and $b_{\text{scm}}$ is
the scrambling sequence.
#### 5.1.3.2 Turbo Coding
The native scheme of the deployed Turbo encoder is a Parallel Concatenated
Convolutional Code (PCCC) with two identical 8-state constituent encoders with
the polynominal
_g_ ~0~(_D_)=_g_ ~1~(_D_) = 1 + _D_ ^2^ + _D_ ^3^,
and one Turbo code internal interleaver. The resulting coding rate of the
Turbo coder is _r_ = 1/3. The structure of the Turbo coder is illustrated in
Figure 6. The initial value of the shift registers of the 8-state constituent
encoders are set to zeros prior to encoding the MSD. The bits output from the
Turbo code internal interleaver are to be input to the second 8-state
constituent encoder.
{width="5.699305555555555in" height="3.904861111111111in"}
Figure 6: Structure of a rate 1/3 Turbo coder (*1: dotted lines apply for
trellis termination only)
Trellis termination is performed by taking the tail bits from the shift
register feedback after all information bits are encoded. Tail bits are padded
after the encoding of information bits. The first three tail bits are used to
terminate the first constituent encoder (upper switch in Figure 6 in lower
position) while the second constituent encoder is disabled. The last three
tail bits are used to terminate the second constituent encoder (lower switch
in Figure 6 in lower position) while the first constituent encoder is
disabled.
The Turbo code internal interleaver consists of bits-input to a rectangular
matrix with padding, intra-row and inter-row permutations of the rectangular
matrix, and bits-output from the rectangular matrix with pruning [2].
The parity blocks are generated with the same convolutional encoder, and 3
tail bits are generated from the FEC encoder states [2].
The encoder outputs are collected in the channel coded bit buffer according to
Figure 7.
Figure 7: Channel coded bit buffer
#### 5.1.3.3 HARQ for MSD messages
The applied HARQ scheme can create eight different redundancy versions (RV),
_rv_ 0 ... _rv_ 7, from the channel coded bit buffer. Each one of the RV
consists of a subset of 1380 bits from the channel coded bit buffer. _rv_ 0,
_rv_ 2, _rv_ 4, and _rv_ 6 contain the entire MSD+CRC part of the channel
coded bit buffer. The maximum code rate of the coding scheme is _r~eff~_ â‰ˆ
0.83 since the MSD and CRC are 1148 bit altogether. The redundancy is
increased with every further transmission of RVs.
The generation of different redundancy versions of the MSD from the above FEC
encoded bitstream is defined in ROM tables and can be found in 3GPP TS 26.268
[2].
### 5.1.4 Modulation
The encoded binary data stream bits $b_{i}$are grouped into symbols. Each
symbol $d_{j}$ carries 3 bits of information and modulates one basic uplink
waveform which corresponds to one modulation frame.
There are two modulator modes, a fast modulator mode and a robust modulator
mode. Under normal conditions, a transmission is successful when applying the
fast modulator mode. The robust modulator mode serves as a back up solution if
a transmission fails in unusually difficult environments. The modulator modes
merely differ by symbol duration, i.e., the length of the modulation frames,
which is 2 ms for the fast modulator mode and 4 ms for the robust modulator
mode. In terms of samples this is 16 samples for the fast modulator mode and
32 samples for the robust modulator mode at 8 kHz sampling rate. Therefore, a
speech frame accommodates 10 modulation frames (containing 10 symbols, or 30
bit) for the fast modulator mode and 5 modulation frames (5 symbols or 15 bit)
for the robust modulator mode. Hence, the modulation data rates are 1 500
bit/s and 750 bit/s, respectively, not accounting for muting gaps and
synchronization frames.
The uplink waveform is determined by the basic uplink waveform
$p_{\text{UL}}(n)$, which is
for the fast modulator mode (_n_ = 0,...,15) and
for the robust modulator mode (_n_ = 0,...,31). These values are given with
respect to a signed 16-bit signal representation. The mapping between the
symbol $d_{j}$ and the uplink waveform is given by a cyclic right-shift of _k_
samples, denoted by $(p \rightarrow k)$, and the sign _q_ of the basic uplink
waveform $p_{\text{UL}}(n)$. Table 1 details this mapping. Note that the
position (cyclic shift) of the waveform carries two bits of information while
the sign of the waveform adds another bit of information. Figure 8 illustrates
the slot structure of both modulator modes. It represents a particular example
symbol sequence in an abstract way by neglecting the actual shape and signs of
the waveforms. The large bars indicate the maxima of the basic uplink
waveforms according to the example symbols whereas the small ones indicate the
other potential maximum positions.

### 5.1.5 MSD data frame format
Each MSD data frame includes one encoded MSD message with CRC field, split up
into multiple data fields.
The MSD data frame forms the largest fraction of uplink data traffic and
consists of three data fields, four muting gaps, and three synchronization
fragments (see clause 5.1.6), arranged as given in Table 2a.

### 5.1.6 Synchronization signal and frame format
The synchronization frame consists of the direct concatenation of:
1) the synchronization tone $s_{t}(n)$; and
2) the synchronization preamble $s_{p}(n)$. Note that the synchronization
preamble is not only used in the synchronization frame, but fragments thereof
are also inserted into the MSD data frame for the purpose of synchronization
tracking.
The synchronization tone $s_{t}(n)$consists of a sampled sinusoidal tone of
frequency 500 Hz or 800 Hz, and of 64 ms duration. A frequency of 500 Hz is
chosen to indicate that the fast modulator mode is to be applied and a
frequency of 800 Hz indicates that the robust modulator mode is used for the
subsequent MSD frames.
The synchronization tone $s_{t}(n)$is followed by synchronization preamble
$s_{p}(n)$. The synchronization preamble is a pulse sequence known at the
receiver. The pulse sequence for the synchronization preamble has been chosen
to optimize autocorrelation properties in order to allow a very reliable
detection and delay estimation at the same time. The achieved accuracy of the
delay estimation is typically exact by sample.
The basis of the synchronization preamble $s_{p}(n)$is a PN sequence of length
15 that takes values of (1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1).
Each pulse has an amplitude of 20000 in a signed 16-bit signal representation.
The pulse sequence is composed of 5 periods of this PN sequence. The outer
periods (number 1 and 5) are inverted (i.e. all elements are multiplied with
-1) and those parts that are common to the inverted and non inverted sequence
are transmitted just once, see Figure 9. Figure 10 illustrates the resulting
pulse sequence.

Figure 10: Pulse sequence for generation of synchronization preamble
In the pulse sequence, neighboring pulses are placed 22 samples apart to form
the synchronization preamble, i.e. zeroâ€‘padding of 21 zero samples between
pulses is applied. In addition, 71 zero samples are placed before the first
pulse. The resulting synchronization preamble has a duration of 71 + 69 +
(68*21) = 1568 samples, or 196 ms.
Both synchronization tone $s_{t}(n)$ and synchronization preamble $s_{p}(n)$
can be stored in a ROM table to avoid computation at runtime. These tables can
be found in 3GPP TS 26.268 [2], and they should serve as a reference of the
synchronization signal..
The overall length of the synchronization frame is 13 frames or 260 ms.
For the purpose of uplink synchronization tracking, fragments of the
synchronization preample are inserted into the MSD data frame (see Table 2a).
A synchronization fragment consists of the last 576 samples of the
synchronization preamble $s_{p}(n)$, prepended by 64 zero-samples. A
synchronization fragment is thus 640 samples or 80 ms long.
### 5.1.7 Multiplexing
The multiplexer combines the synchronization frame and the MSD data frames to
the effective transmit signal as in Figure 11.
Figure 11: Uplink data format with multiplexing
### 5.1.8 Uplink signal and retransmission
The uplink signal starts with a synchronization frame (SF) which is succeeded
by one or more MSD redundancy versions, e.g. MSD _rv_ 0, MSD _rv_ 1, MSD _rv_
2, etc. as shown in Figure 12.
MSD _rv_ 0 is the first transmission of a full MSD message. MSD _rv_ 1
represents the first retransmission, MSD _rv_ 2 the second retransmission,
each with a different version of incremental redundancy (IR). Up to eight
different versions of incremental redundancy are allowed (MSD _rv_ 0 ... MSD
_rv_ 7).
In good channel conditions, the MSD should be successfully decodable after the
reception of the first transmission, MSD _rv_ 0.
The IVS transmitter stops transmitting when an ACK message is received on the
downlink by the IVS receiver.
If, after one transmission attempt (consisting of 8 RV transmissions), the MSD
message is still not received correctly, the MSD transmission cycle is started
again with one synchronization frame and MSD _rv_ 0, using the robust
modulator mode. The PSAP receiver resets the IR combining buffer after 8
received MSD messages, switches the demodulation mode, and restarts combining
again.
Figure 12: Uplink signal format
The generation of different redundancy versions of the MSD is defined in ROM
tables and can be found in 3GPP TS 26.268 [2].
### 5.1.9 Additional signal format for _push_ mode
If the IVS is to issue the request for MSD transmission, it reuses the
downlink signal format according to clause 6.1. The message used for the data
part is reproduced in Table 2b. The modulated data may be precomputed and
stored in the IVS ROM. Several such messages are transmitted before an IVS
state change triggers the MSD transmission, or a timeout occurs.

## 5.2 IVS receiver
The IVS receiver demodulates and decodes feedback messages (START, NACK, link-
layer ACK, and higher-layer ACK) from the PSAP. It starts the IVS transmitter
after detecting a request message (the START trigger) for MSD data
transmission on the downlink. The different blocks of the IVS receiver are
shown in Figure 13.
Figure 13: IVS receiver block diagram
### 5.2.1 Synchronization detector/tracker
For support of the synchronization/detection function, each synchronization
frame includes two parts, which are denoted as synchronization tone and
synchronization preamble as described in clause 5.1.6.
NOTE: The downlink synchronization frame is identical to the uplink
synchronization frame (except that the downlink only uses a frequency of 500
Hz for the synchronization tone), however, the data frame formats are
different in uplink and downlink.
The synchronization detector/tracker has three main functions:
1) Scan the input signal and identify the start of an eCall data transmission.
The result of this operation is a synchronization detection flag which
indicates whether or not eCall data transmission has been detected.
2) Determine the timing of the data frame. The result of this operation is
timing information from which the location of the data burst in the input
signal can be calculated at sample resolution.
3) Continuously check and track the data frame timing. Based on the
subsequently received synchronization frames, the validity of the data frame
timing is checked. In case the check fails, the synchronization tracker tries
to identify a new valid data frame timing.
To avoid false detection of an eCall data transmission in the IVS receiver,
the synchronization detector evaluates three consecutive sync frames. It sets
the detection flag _DF_ = 1, only if the same timing information is detected
in three successively detected sync preambles. This feature is also required
to prevent misdetection of the START message and to keep the synchronization
failure rate at virtually zero.
The synchronization preamble sequence in Figure 10 is constructed to have good
autocorrelation properties for optimal detection as shown in Figure 14.
Figure 14: Autocorrelation properties of pulse sequence of Figure 10
The synchronization algorithm acquires the delay value by checking the
correctness of the distance between the five correlation peaks. A preamble is
considered detected if either the pair of peaks (2, 4) or the pair of peaks
(1, 5) exhibit correct distances from each other, provided that they either
fulfil certain amplitude constraints (the amplitude differences shall not
differ by more than a factor of 3 and their average shall not be less than
half of the global maximal sync filter output since first activation of the
synchronization detector), or one additional peak is identified.
To distinguish between higher-layer ACK message and link-layer ACK messages on
the downlink, an inverted sync pulse sequence precedes the higher-layer ACK
messages. The synchronization detector determines the signs of the
autocorrelation pulses independently from the absolute peak values and peak
distances. The correlation peak signs are used to determine whether the
incoming feedback message is a link-layer ACK or higher-layer ACK message. If
an inverted sign of autocorrelation pulses is detected right from the
beginning of uplink and/or downlink transmissions, the synchronization
detector assumes that a signal inversion is occurring on the transmission
path. In this case, all received PCM samples are multiplied by -1 on the
affected link for the remainder of the MSD transmission.
Because feedback messages are transmitted continuously on the downlink, it is
usually sufficient for the IVS receiver to perform the synchronization only
once per MSD. This means, synchronization can be locked once an eCall data
transmission has been detected and the timing information has been computed.
Nevertheless, there exist rare scenarios that may require a resynchronization
due to lost synchronization, e.g. because of an adaptive jitter buffer, or an
analog PSTN line with sampling clocks drifting between transmitter and
receiver. Therefore, the correctness of the synchronization is checked
continuously (referred to as 'Sync Check') by evaluating the existence of
correlation peaks at the expected peak positions for any of the feedback
messages. The data part of a message is ignored if none of the five peaks is
detected.
A sync tracking feature is also implemented which re-uses the original
synchronization algorithm and evaluates the cross-correlations of the incoming
signal and the known synchronization sequence in a certain interval around the
previously expected delay position . The width of this serach interval can be
set as a parameter of the synchronization function, with a maximum value of
+/-- 480 samples in the IVS sync tracker. Note that the cross-correlation
search can be efficiently implemented by FIR filtering.
If no valid delay position can be identified 8 times in a row, the IVS resets
itself.
### 5.2.2 Timing Unit
The timing unit adjusts the timing of the received signal for the following
processing stages according to the timing information obtained by the
synchronization detector/tracker.
### 5.2.3 De-multiplexing
The de-multiplexer removes the muting and synchronization signals from the
input data stream.
### 5.2.4 Data demodulation and FEC decoding
The data demodulator and decoder on the downlink are represented by a single
correlator matched directly to the modulated downlink waveforms. The received
waveform is correlated to each of the stored waveforms and a maximum
likelihood decision on the feedback message, _msg_ , is made.
Since only a very small number of different data messages (see Table 3) is
used on the downlink, the entire expected signal patterns can be stored at the
IVS receiver. These patterns have a length of 480 samples each (corresponding
to 60 ms, which is the length of modulated feedback messages). In the
demodulator/decoder the cross-correlation between the received signal and the
stored pattern for each possible transmit message is calculated, and a
decision for a message is made according to individual correlation thresholds.
If synchronization has detected a message, but the demodulator threshold is
not reached for either of the valid messages, the message is marked as
unreliable and ignored in the case of lower-layer ACK or NACK. In case of
START, the first six unreliable messages are ignored, but subsequent
unreliable messages are not distinguished from reliable ones any more. For
higher-layer ACK, unreliable messages contribute with a lower weight to the
detection decision. The compressed higher-layer ACK is considered as
successfully received if three consecutive messages (irrespective of
reliability), or two reliable, consecutive messages, are detected with
identical data.
### 5.2.5 Message handler
This function activates the appropriate functions in the IVS modem according
to the message received. After synchronization is locked, the IVS transmitter
is activated to send MSD data to the PSAP once a START message has been
received. During an ongoing transmission, a sequence of least 3 reliable START
messages is required to restart the MSD transmission from the IVS to the PSAP.
As long as only NACKs are received, MSD transmission continues with
incremental redundancy. A successfully received link-layer ACK or a higher-
layer ACK simply instruct the IVS transmitter to stop transmission. Also, if
the Sync Check fails to track the preamble, the IVS transmitter is reset to
idle state.
# 6 Functional description of the PSAP data modem
This clause describes the different functions of the PSAP data modem.
## 6.1 PSAP transmitter
The PSAP transmitter generates the signal sent on the downlink. This signal is
required to control the transmission of the MSD message on the uplink. The
different blocks of the PSAP transmitter are shown in Figure 15.
Figure 15: PSAP transmitter block diagram
### 6.1.1 Message encoding
The PSAP transmitter is designed to send up to 16 different link-layer
feedback messages to the IVS. Three of them are used currently as follows:
1) START signal, i.e. the signal that triggers start of the IVS MSD
transmission.
2) NACK, i.e. negative acknowledgement upon CRC check failure.
3) ACK, i.e. positive acknowledgement upon CRC check success.
A fourth link-layer message is defined for exclusive use in the higher-layer
ACK message (see Table 3).
### 6.1.2 BCH encoding
The link-layer feedback message code is error protected by a shortened (60, 4)
BCH block code which is derived from a (63, 7) BCH code. The messages and
their encoded representations are shown in Table 3.
Table 3: Downlink message encoding

* * *
The binary representations of the link-layer feedback messages defined in
Table 3 are re-used for the compressed higher-layer ACK (HL-ACK) message, in
which four data bits (i.e., two of the binary link-layer message
representations) are transmitted in a different feedback message format (see
clause 6.1.4)
### 6.1.3 Modulation
The encoded binary data stream bits $b_{i}$are grouped into symbols. Each
symbol $d_{j}$ carries 4 bits of information and modulates one basic downlink
waveform.
The duration of the downlink waveform is 4 ms or 32 samples at 8 kHz sampling
rate. Therefore 5 modulation frames correspond in length to one speech frame.
Each modulated waveform carries one symbol of 4 bits of binary information and
the modulation data rate is 1 000 bits/s for the downlink transmitter
(modulation data rate for FEC-encoded bits, not considering muting gaps and
synchronization frame).
The basic downlink waveform $p_{\text{DL}}(n)$is defined for _n_ = 0,...,31 as
follows:
_p~DL~(n)_ = (40, -200, 560, -991, -1400, 7636, 15000, 7636, -1400, -991, 560,
-200, 40, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
Table 4 describes the symbol modulation mapping between symbol and the
downlink waveform. The downlink waveform is derived from the basic downlink
waveform _p~DL~(n)_ by a cyclic right-shift by _k_ samples, denoted by $(p
\rightarrow k)$, and multiplication with a sign _q_.

* * *
Since there are only few messages for the downlink and the modulated waveform
for each message is relatively short (480 samples), the modulated downlink
waveforms are stored in ROM tables to save computation complexity at runtime.
The downlink waveforms can be found in 3GPP TS 26.268 [2].
### 6.1.4 Downlink signal
#### 6.1.4.1 Link-layer feedback messages
Every downlink message starts with a synchronization frame (as defined in
clause 5.1.6) and continues with a feedback frame. For the link-layer control
messages, the feedback frame consists of a single DL-Data field surrounded by
muting periods as follows:
1) 3 frames of muting, M1 (60 ms).
2) 3 frames of modulated data, DL-Data (60 ms).
3) 1 frame of muting, M2 (20 ms).
Each DL-Data field includes one of the three types of link-layer messages in a
block-encoded representation as described in clause 6.1.2.
#### 6.1.4.2 Higher-layer acknowledgement messages
For the higher-layer acknowledgement messages, the synchronization frame
defined in clause 5.1.6 is inverted (i.e., each sample is multiplied with -1).
The feedback frame consists of two DL-Data fields preceded by a muting period
as follows:
1) 1 frame of muting, M1 (20 ms).
2) 3 frames of modulated data, DL-Data 1 (60 ms).
3) 3 frames of modulated data, DL-Data 2 (60 ms).
Each DL-Data field includes one of the four types of block-encoded two-bit
binary message representations as described in clause 6.1.2. The feedback
frame for higher-layer acknowledgement messages therefore transports four
information bits for use by the higher-layer application protocol (HLAP).
These information bits can be used to satisfy the eCall requirements [1], e.g.
to clear down the call.
#### 6.1.4.3 Handling of downlink messages
The PSAP transmitter retransmits the START message multiple times until it has
detected the uplink synchronization frame. Upon detection of the
synchronization frame, the PSAP transmitter sends a series of NACK messages,
until a successful CRC check of the MSD message is obtained. After successful
MSD detection, the PSAP transmitter sends link-layer ACK messages and/or the
higher-layer ACK (HL-ACK). This operation is illustrated in Figure 16.
Figure 16: Downlink signal format
If the PSAP transmitter fails to obtain uplink synchronization, it will not
start transmitting NACK on the downlink. Instead, START messages are repeated.
The IVS awaits the reception of a NACK after transmission of the first uplink
synchronization frame. If instead repeated START messages are received, it
interrupts the current MSD transmission attempt and starts with a new
synchronization frame and MSD rv0. If the receiver is not able to decode the
message successfully within 8 redundancy versions or if the Sync Tracker
indicates that synchronization has been lost on the uplink, it asks the IVS to
restart the transmission with a new synchronization frame and MSD rv0. This is
achieved by switching from NACK to START messages.
The repetition of START messages by the PSAP (in case it does not obtain any
uplink synchronization) continues until the PSAP modem is manually switched
off by the operator. An automatic PSAP timeout mechanism should be added to
the PSAP implementation if this behaviour is not desirable. The PSAP timeout
mechanism is not part of this specification.
### 6.1.5 Synchronization
Synchronization signals for the PSAP transmitter are as described in clause
5.1.6, except that a value of 5000 is added to the PN sequence pulses (i.e.,
the resulting pulses have amplitudes of 25000 and -15000), and the original
zeroes are replaced by samples with a value of 12000.
For higher-layer acknowledgement messages, the synchronization frame defined
above is inverted (i.e., each sample is multiplied with -1).
### 6.1.6 Multiplexing
The multiplexer combines synchronization, muting and feedback frames to form
the downlink signal for the PSAP transmitter.
## 6.2 PSAP receiver
The PSAP receiver demodulates the MSD message from the IVS and checks the
integrity of the received MSD by evaluating the CRC field. The different
blocks of the PSAP receiver are shown in Figure 17.
Figure 17: PSAP receiver block diagram
The PSAP receiver continuously monitors traffic from the speech decoder in
idle or standby state. When the PSAP receiver is in idle state, speech from
the speech decoder passes through as in normal voice call.
Once an eCall sync burst is detected, the PSAP transitions out of idle state
and the speech path to audio out is muted.
### 6.2.1 Synchronization detector/tracker
Basically, the uplink synchronization detector/tracker works as described in
clause 5.2.1. Some differences are given in the following.
The detection of a single synchronization preamble is sufficient to trigger
the PSAP. A Sync Observer checks the received signal for another 10 speech
frames after a preamble has been detected. This is to ensure that
synchronization does not find a more reliable preamble, which would mean that
the previous detection would have been a false detection (wrong delay value).
In case synchronization does find a better preamble it restarts the reception
of the MSD.
The Sync Check function continuously checks the validity of the identified
delay value, based on the subsequently transmitted uplink synchronization
fragments. If the delay value is found to be invalid, the Sync Tracker
searches for a new valid delay value within a pre-defined search window. The
maximum setting for the search window at the PSAP receiver is +/-- 240
samples. If, after an invalid delay value, the Sync Tracker cannot identify a
new valid delay value for a certain number of subsequent synchronization
fragments (default value is four unsuccessful tracking attempts), it resets
the PSAP transmitter in order to re-initiate the MSD transmission by sending
START messages to the IVS.
A tone detector based on a DFT evaluation at the two reference frequencies is
used to evaluate the frequency of the sync tone. If the frequency can be
detected reliably, then this decision is taken to decide on which modulator is
used for demodulation. If a reliable detection is not possible, the fast
modulation scheme is chosen if it is the first time that a preamble has been
detected successfully while receiving the current MSD. Otherwise, the robust
demodulator is chosen.
### 6.2.2 Timing Unit
As described in clause 5.2.2.
### 6.2.3 De-multiplexer
As described in clause 5.2.3.
### 6.2.4 Data demodulator
The data demodulator is represented by a correlator matched to the modulated
waveform applied by the data modulator of the IVS transmitter. Specifically,
correlations for all possible symbols are calculated:
$\begin{matrix} r(i) = \sum_{j = 0}^{n}{\text{ulPulse}(j) \ast
\text{ulPulseMatch}(i)(j)\ } \ r(i + 4) = - r(3 - i),\ i = 0,1,2,3 \
\end{matrix}$
where _n_ =15 for the fast modulation mode and _n_ =31 for the robust
modulation mode.
The correlation values $r(i)$are then normalized by their variance and
subtracted by a mean value to be converted to soft symbols for the HARQ FEC
decoder [2].
### 6.2.5 HARQ FEC decoder
The HARQ decoder combines the demodulated and deinterleaved data signal with
previously transmitted redundancy versions. For this operation it applies a
two stage rate matching scheme and performs turbo decoding of the combined
soft-information.
To speed up the MSD reception in adverse transmission conditions, the HARQ
decoding is performed for partially received messages, starting from the
second redundancy version, _rv_ 1\. Decoding is then attempted after reception
of each of the three data parts of the MSD frame (see clause 5.1.5). The
decoding attempts based on partial messages is beneficial since, in many
cases, the correct MSD can be decoded already after the incremental redundancy
contained in the first data part D1 of _rv_ 1\. Figure 18 summarizes the
decoder algorithm.
After MSD data bits are decoded, a descrambling operation as described in
clause 5.1.2 applies.
{width="5.959722222222222in" height="2.2493055555555554in"}
Figure 18: Turbo decoder
### 6.2.6 CRC handling
This function performs a CRC check and outputs a CRC flag. The CRC flag
triggers transmission of an ACK or NACK message by the PSAP transmitter.
### 6.2.7 _Push_ mode - _push_ message detector
In _push_ mode the PSAP receiver starts monitoring the incoming signal
immediately after the call has been established. For the _push_ message (IVS
initiation sequence) detection, it applies the same receiver as described in
clause 5.2. A _push_ command is considered detected if two correct sync
preambles have been detected and a subsequent _push_ message (see Table 2b)
has been identified.
# 7 Transmission protocol and error handling
This clause describes the employed eCall transmission protocol in normal
operation, and its handling of transmission errors.
## 7.1 Normal operation
The operation of the eCall data transmission in the \"normal\" non-erroneous
case works as outlined on a high level in the previous clauses.
Upon request by the operator or by the IVS _push_ message, the PSAP
transmitter starts sending START messages. The IVS receiver shall detect the
synchronization preambles that are transmitted along with the START messages
and obtain synchronization. This enables the IVS receiver to demodulate and
detect the START messages. The PSAP transmitter continues sending START
messages to the IVS at this stage.
Upon detection of the START message, the IVS starts the transmission of the
first MSD message with incremental redundancy version _rv_ 0 which is preceded
by a synchronization frame. The PSAP receiver shall detect the synchronization
frame and obtain exact synchronization on the synchronization preamble. The
PSAP receiver is then enabled to demodulate the MSD and to decode it.
As soon as the PSAP receiver has obtained synchronization, it changes the PSAP
to NACK message transmission and continues sending this message repeatedly.
The IVS transmitter then should detect the NACK messages. The IVS continues
sending MSD data. When transmission of the MSD message with _rv_ 0 has been
completed, the IVS transmitter continues sending the next redundancy version
_rv_ 1 of the same MSD, and so on.
The PSAP receiver, after demodulation of the full MSD with rv0, performs a CRC
check. If the CRC check fails, the PSAP receiver continues sending NACK
messages. If the CRC check succeeds, the PSAP transmitter changes the message
to the link-layer or higher-layer ACK message. It is up to higher-layer
protocol requirements whether link-layer and/or higher-layer ACK messages are
transmitted. From a modem protocol perspective, at least five ACK messages of
one type (either link-layer or higher-layer) shall be transmitted
consecutively for security. No higher-layer ACK message shall preceed a link-
layer ACK message, and no link-layer ACK message shall succeed a higher-layer
ACK message. The IVS receiver should detect an ACK of one particular type
(link-layer or higher-layer) and then stop the IVS transmitter sending the
MSD.
## 7.2 Abnormal operation
This clause describes some abnormal scenarios which may occur due to severe
signal distortion on the transmission channels and which need to be handled by
the overall transmission protocol to avoid any deadlock situations. This
description of abnormal scenarios is not necessarily exhaustive.

implemented against it in the eCall solution. In the table, the reference

**Ref #** **Scenario** **Error description** **Error handling** **Comments**
1.1.1 IVS receiver does not detect the sync frames or gets different delays
from subsequent preamble detections. MSD message will never be sent Start
message is sent a defined number times If the start message is not detected
within a defined time, the PSAP goes back to idle state. In this case another
attempt could be started manually by the PSAP operator. 1.1.2 IVS receiver
detects equal sync frames while none were sent. Sync false alarm Sync Check
verifies the validity of the sync continuously and resets the IVS if
necessary. Synchronization at the IVS has been designed such that the
probability of this error is negligibly small (virtually zero). 1.1.3 IVS
receiver detects sync frames incorrectly and triggers nevertheless. START
message is usually not detected correctly and MSD message will never be sent
Same as #1.1.2 Same as #1.1.2 1.1.4 Synchronization gets lost due to some
abnormal channel conditions Feedback messages are skipped due to Sync Check
and unsuccessful Sync Tracker Same as #1.1.2 The Sync Tracker usually avoids
this situation (e.g., due to adaptive jitter buffers or in the unlikely case
of a handover) 1.2.1.1 In-sync, but detection of START messages fails If START
message is never detected, same as 1.1.1. START message is repeated a defined
number of times. This decreases the likelihood of this case to almost zero  
1.2.1.2 In-sync, instead of a START message a NACK is detected MSD message is
not sent if transmission has not yet started. If a transmission is ongoing, it
will not be restarted although the PSAP would want the IVS to restart. PSAP
always transmits more than just one START message. A NACK before the first
START message is ignored  
1.2.1.3 In-sync, instead of a START message an ACK is detected MSD message is
not sent if transmission has not yet started. If a transmission is ongoing,
the IVS could terminate the transmission erroneously PSAP always transmits
more than just one START message. An ACK before the first START message is
ignored. If the transmission is terminated, the PSAP operator could retrigger
the transmission of the MSD.  
1.2.2.1 In-sync, NACK message is not detected NACK messages are repeated until
the correct MSD is received IVS behaviour does not change in this case 1.2.2.2
In-sync, instead of a NACK message a START message is detected MSD
transmission may be interrupted and restarted Only after a successive
reception of three START messages the MSD transmission is restarted The
probability of subsequent erroneously detected START messages is very low.
1.2.2.3 In-sync, instead of a NACK message an ACK is detected IVS stops MSD
transmission before PSAP has detected it. At least two ACK messages need to be
detected subsequently in order to stop transmission at the IVS. PSAP operator
could retrigger the transmission of the MSD. The probability of the subsequent
erroneously detected ACK messages is very low. 1.2.3.1 In-sync, ACK message is
not detected Results in prolonged MSD transmission ACK messages are sent
several times Not a problem as long as only few ACKs are missed. 1.2.3.2 In-
sync, instead of a ACK message a START message is detected Same as 1.2.2.2
Same as 1.2.2.2  
1.2.3.3 In-sync, instead of a ACK message a NACK is detected Same as 1.2.3.1
Same as 1.2.3.1 Same as 1.2.3.1 2.1.1 No sync frame detection PSAP misses the
MSD The PSAP continues sending START messages to the IVS until it detects a
sync preamble. The IVS restarts transmission of the MSD with sync frame when
it continuously receives START messages from the PSAP.  
2.1.2 PSAP receiver detects a sync frame while none was sent Sync frame false
alarm, PSAP tries to decode data, but fails. After having failed the detection
of a valid sync delay in subsequent sync frames, of after an unsuccessful
reception of the MSD, the PSAP will ask the IVS to resend the MSD by
transmitting START messages again. Introduces a delay in MSD transmission
2.1.3 Sync tone evaluated incorrectly Wrong modulator mode used to demodulate
the MSD If there are doubts about the reliability of the tone detection, the
PSAP uses the fast modulator mode for the first trial of demodulating the MSD
(first set of 8 RVs) and the robust modulator mode otherwise. This assumption
about the modulator mode will be incorrect only if the IVS completely fails to
evaluate many feedback messages, which is very unlikely. 2.2 Sync detected,
correct timing, false positive detection of MSD messages CRC gives incorrect
result Very unlikely

###### ## Annex A (informative): eCall Performance Requirements/Objectives and
Design Constraints
Minimum performance requirements for non-bitexact implementations of the eCall
modems, as well as exact performance figures of the bit-exact implementation,
are given in a separate Conformance Testing document.
The following is reproduced for information form the permanent document
\"eCall Performance Requirements / Objectives and Design Constraints\", for
eCall Phase 2.
# A.1 Definitions
**Performance Requirements** shall be met by an eCall candidate, otherwise it
is excluded from the selection.
Note: The Performance Requirements include all service requirements.
**Performance Objectives provide no hard limits, but allow ranking of
candidates according to defined criteria.**
**Design Constraints provide upper limits (requirements and objectives), e.g.
on algorithmic complexity.**
**Selection Checking of candidate solutions against the Performance
Requirements and Design Constraints, and ranking of candidates based on
Performance Objectives, after which the highest-ranked candidate is
selected.**
**The eCall Protocol is the overall application-layer protocol between the IVS
and PSAP. The selected candidate will provide data transport (\"MODEM\") for
the eCall procedure. However, the application-layer of the eCall procedure is
out of the scope.**
# A.2 Performance Requirements
The following text defines point by point the (Service) Performance
Requirements for an eCall candidate. They have been taken directly from 3GPP
TS 22.101 [1].
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 22.101 [1] has been modified in the meantime to version
V8.8.0. The changes introduced have been evaluated. They have no influence on
the selection phase for eCall.
NOTE 2: For the sake of the selection procedure, the candidate shall provide
means for automatic retransmission. This is however not necessarily the final
eCall Protocol.
1\. The data may be sent prior to, in parallel with, or at the start of the
voice component of an emergency call.
NOTE 3: In-band data can not be sent prior to the point in time when the voice
channel is established end-to-end.
This requirement does not require additional interpretation.
2\. Should the PSAP request additional data then this may be possible during
the established emergency call.\ This service requirement is considered in the
selection as follows:\ \"The eCall candidate algorithm shall allow the PSAP to
request additional data at any time during the established emergency call.\"
3\. The realisation of the transfer of data during an emergency call shall
minimise changes to the originating and transit networks.\ _This service
requirement is considered in the selection as follows: \"The introduction of
the eCall data transfer feature should have minimal (ideally no) impact on any
existing mobile and transit network (in Europe), i.e. it should not require
(major) changes nor impose (major) restrictions to future evolutions of the
networks.\"_
4\. Both the voice and data components of the emergency call shall be routed
to the same PSAP or designated emergency call centre.
NOTE 4: In-band data can not be routed somewhere other than the voice channel
it uses.
This service requirement does not need to be considered in the selection.
5\. The transmission of the data shall be acknowledged and if necessary data
shall be retransmitted.\ _This service requirement is considered in the
selection as follows: \"_ In the case of errors detected by the candidate
algorithm in the received data, a retransmission shall be requested by the
candidate algorithm.\"
6\. A UE configured only to transfer data during emergency calls (e.g. eCall
only UE) shall not generate signalling to the network besides what is needed
to place an emergency call.\ This service requirement does not need to be
considered in the selection.
7\. With the exception of the following specific requirements, considered
necessary for the satisfactory operation of the eCall service, all existing
TS12 emergency call requirements shall apply.\ This service requirement does
not need to be considered in the selection.
8\. An eCall shall consist of a TS12 emergency call supplemented by a minimum
set of emergency related data (MSD).\ This service requirement does not need
to be considered in the selection.
9\. An eCall may be initiated automatically, for example due to a vehicle
collision, or manually by the vehicle occupants.\ This service requirement
does not need to be considered in the selection.
10\. The Minimum Set of Data (MSD) sent by the In vehicle System (IVS) to the
network shall not exceed 140 bytes.\ _This service requirement is considered
in the selection as follows: \"_ The whole 140 Bytes of the MSD shall be made
available to the PSAP _.\"_
11\. The MSD should typically be made available to the PSAP within 4 seconds,
measured from the time when end to end connection with the PSAP is
established.\ _This service requirement is considered in the selection as
follows: \"In optimal conditions (error-free radio channel, GSM FR codec and
FR AMR 12.2 kbit/s mode) the eCall candidate procedure shall be able to
transmit the whole 140 bytes of the MSD reliably within 4 seconds, measured
from the time when the transmission from the IVS to the PSAP begins (after a
trigger from the PSAP has been detected).\"_
NOTE 5: See Performance Requirement 14.
NOTE 6: \"Reliability\" is defined in the new Performance Requirement 15.
NOTE 7: The Performance Objectives give additional guidelines for the
performance under non-ideal channel conditions.
12\. Should the MSD component not be included in an eCall, or is corrupted or
lost for any reason, then this shall not affect the associated TS12 emergency
call speech functionality.\ This service requirement does not need to be
considered in the selection _._
13\. A call progress indication shall be provided to the user whilst the MSD
transmission is in progress\ This service requirement does not need to be
considered in the selection.
> In addition to the above Service Requirements, the following Performance
> Requirement shall apply to an eCall candidate solution.
14\. Installation of eCall equipment in a vehicle shall not affect an
emergency call to a PSAP which is not upgraded to receive eCall data, i.e.
_the eCall candidate algorithm shall not send the eCall data unless the PSAP
requests that it do so._
_15\. The MSD shall be transmitted reliably to the PSAP. An MSD transmission
is considered reliably terminated, if a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of at
least 28 bits, applied to the entire MSD, detects no errors._
NOTE 8: If the CRC detects an error in the MSD, then an automatic
retransmission shall be triggered, unless the PSAP decides to stop the
transmission.
# A.3 Performance Objectives
Performance Objective 1: The overall average transmission time should be as
small as possible.
Performance Objective 2: Under all test conditions, a candidate should be as
good as or better than the proposed eCall_via_CTM* (see 3GPP TR 26.967 [4])
would be.
NOTE: The objectives in the present document are intended as guidelines for
designers of eCall solution candidates. The exact rules of candidate selection
are specified in a separate document (PD3, \"eCall Selection Test\").
Objective 1 will be considered in the formulation of these rules. Objective 2
is intended only as a guideline and will not be considered in the formulation
of the selection rules.
_Performance Objective 1 is explained in detail in the following:_
For any particular test condition (specified by speech codec plus radio
channel error condition), the observed transmission time of the 140 bytes of
the MSD may vary depending on the parameters of the channel simulation and the
specific contents of the MSD. Therefore each MSD transmission may be regarded
as one trial _k_ in a random experiment, where the observed transmission time,
_T~k~_ , is the random variable of interest. For each particular test
condition _C,_ the MSD transmission is repeated with different, randomly
generated MSD data for at least 100 times (_k_ = 1, 2, ..., _n_ , where _n_
â‰¥100) to get enough statistical significance.
To ensure a practical limit on the time required for testing a candidate, the
observed value of _T~k\ ~_ must have a reasonable upper bound. This upper
bound, _t~UB~_ , is fixed at a value of 200 seconds for one trial for all test
conditions. Any value of _T~k\ ~_ that is observed to be greater than _t~UB~_
will be classified as a transmission failure and will be assigned the value of
_t~UB~_.
Each particular test condition _C_ gives an observed sample distribution
_T~1~_ , _T~2~_ , ..., _T~n~_. The statistic of interest is the average value,
_Î¼~C~_ = (_T~1~_ \+ _T~2~_ \+ ... + _T~n~_) / _n_.
The Figure of Merit (FoM) over _all_ test conditions is calculated by
unweighted averaging of _Î¼~C~_ over all particular test conditions _C~1~_ ,
_C~2~_ , ..., _C~m~_. A low Figure of Merit is -- obviously - better than a
higher Figure of Merit. The candidates will be ranked by their Figures of
Merit.
The following assumptions are made for the measurement of _T~k~_.
1\. The starting time of the transmission with respect to speech codec audio
frames is uniformly distributed.
2\. The channel error condition is modelled by an error pattern obtained from
offline simulations. The following radio conditions will be tested:
\- GMSK Full Rate radio channel at C/I values of 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 dB, and
error free; with ideal frequency hopping, with the Typical Urban profile and
with slow vehicle speed. These channel conditions will be applied in both
directions (uplink and downlink) symmetrically.
\- GMSK Full Rate radio channel at RSSI value -100 dBm with no other
interferer. This channel condition will be applied in both directions (uplink
and downlink) symmetrically.
The following speech Codecs will be tested: GSM_FR and FR_AMR (12.2, 10.2,
7.95, 7.4, 6.7, 5.9, 5.15, 4.75 kbps). DTX will be enabled in both directions.
Table A.1 gives an allocation of Codec Conditions to radio conditions in order
to reduce the test effort to the reasonable minimum. The detailed allocation
is defined in PD3, the \"Selection Test Plan\" Permanent Document.

3\. It is assumed that the transmission in the wireline part of the eCall uses
PCM (G.711, A-law) without any further transcoding and with a fixed, pre-
selected level setting.
4\. It is assumed that no acoustical echo is produced by the IVS and that
therefore no Acoustic Echo Suppressor is applied in the network.
5\. It is assumed that no Hybrid Echo is produced by the PSAP connection and
that therefore no Hybrid Echo canceller is applied in the network.
6\. The MSD will contain randomly generated data. (Each possible byte sequence
is considered to be equally probable.)
7\. The round-trip delay between the IVS and PSAP is a randomly generated
value in the range (200 ms, 220 ms).
# A.4 Design Constraints
  * The candidate algorithm as implemented in the IVS should not have > more than 10 times the complexity of CTM. The candidate algorithm > as implemented in the PSAP should not have more than 20 times the > complexity of CTM.\ > The complexity is estimated by compiling the C-Codes under similar > compiler conditions and then measuring the processing times.
  * The candidate algorithm as implemented in the IVS should not require > more than 20KB of data memory. The candidate algorithm as > implemented in the PSAP should not require more than 40KB of data > memory.\ > The memory requirements are estimated by inspection of the > C-Codes.
  * The IVS modem shall not be dependent on knowledge of the UE (e.g. > the speech codec being used and the radio channel conditions).
  * The IVS modem shall not require changes in the UE.
  * The PSAP Modem shall not be dependent on knowledge of the call path > (e.g. the speech codec being used and the radio channel > conditions, delay, transcoding, etc.).
