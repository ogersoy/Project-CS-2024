## 4.3 Information object class definitions
### 4.3.1 GenManCapability
#### 4.3.1.1 Definition
This object class is a support object class. Sub-classes of this IOC represent
the IRPAgent's capability in support of automated management.
It is created by the IRPAgent and cannot be modified by the IRPManager.\ An
instance of a sub-class of genManCapability object is valid for a certain NE
type or a set of NE types.\ Multiple genManCapability objects may be
instantiated in the IRPAgent.
The object identifies\ a) the sequence of the self-configuration steps\ and
for each step\ a.1) the possibility, whether before the step a stop point can
be selected, such that the self-configuration step is suspended and waits for
a request by the IRPManager to resume.\ b) the final administrativeState
(ITU-T X.731) of the NE after successful self-configuration.
#### 4.3.1.2 Attributes

nEInformation M M - stepsAndOfferedStopPointList M M -

* * *
#### 4.3.1.3 Notifications
None.
### 4.3.2 GenManProfile
#### 4.3.2.1 Definition
This object class is a support object class. Sub-classes of this IOC represent
the IRPManager's decision related to automated management.
An instance of a sub-class of GenManProfile is valid for a certain NE type or
a set of NE types.\ For an NE starting its self-configuration process (see
genManProcess) there shall be no ambiguity which instance of a sub-class of
GenManProfile is valid for a certain NE type or a set of NE types.\ Multiple
instances of sub-classes of GenManProfile objects may be instantiated in the
IRPAgent.
By using an instance of a sub-class of this object the IRPManager decides
which of the possible stop points offered in the related instance of a sub-
class of genManCapability are used to suspend the automated management process
of the specified NE type (or set of NE types) and which of the
offeredFinalAdministrativeStateInformation is selected.
#### 4.3.2.2 Attributes

selectedFinalAdministrativeState M M -
* * *
#### Notifications
None.
### 4.3.3 GenManProcess
#### 4.3.3.1 Definition
This object class is a support object class. Sub-classes of this IOC describe
the automated management process for an NE. They allow the IRPManager to be
informed about the current progress of the process and where stop points are
set. No intervention of the IRPManager is foreseen except resume after a stop
point was reached or termination of the self-configuration.
When the automated management process for an NE starts, an instance of the
sub-class of genManProcess is created automatically.
The steps in the stepInfoList shall conform to the content of the relevant
sub-class of genManProfile instance.\ Example:\ If the
stepsAndOfferedStopPointList of a sub-class instance of genManProfile
indicates stopPointCanBeSetBeforeThisStep for step X, then the entry for step
X in the stepInfoList of the sub-class instance of genManProcess can only have
the value stopPointIsNotSet .
When there is no relevant genManProfile at creation time of genManProcess,
then the IRPAgent creates the genManProcess based on the relevant
genManCapability. In this case preferably no stop point shall be set in the
self configuration process.
When the last step of the self configuration process is completed
successfully, the genManProcess instance is deleted automatically.
When self configuration process is terminated by the IRPManager, the
genManProcess instance is deleted automatically.

### 4.3.4 SwMCapability
#### 4.3.4.1 Definition
This object class is a sub-class of genManCapability and represents the
IRPAgent's capability in support of SWM.
It is created by the IRPAgent and cannot be modified by the IRPManager.\ A
SwMManagementCapability object is valid for a certain NE type or a set of NE
types with a certain SW version or set of versions. For an NE there shall be
no ambiguity which SwMManagementCapability object is valid for the NE.\
Multiple SwMManagementCapability objects may be instantiated in the IRPAgent.
The object identifies\ a) the sequence of the self-configuration steps\ and
for each step\ a.1) the possibility, whether before the step a stop point can
be selected, such that the self-configuration step is suspended and waits for
a request by the IRPManager to resume.\ b) the final administrativeState of
the NE after successful self-configuration.

### 4.3.5 SwMProfile
#### 4.3.5.1 Definition
This object class is a sub-class of genManProfile. It allows the IRPManager to
select from the stop points offered in the swMCapabilites object those which
should be used to stop the SW management process for NEs, which fit to the
nEInformation and swVersionToBeInstalled, and which of the
offeredFinalAdministrativeStateInformation is selected.\ For an NE starting
its SWM process there shall be no ambiguity which swMManagementProfile is
valid for the NE. Therefore the nEInformation of different swMProfile
instances shall not intersect. Example for a not allowed intersection: profile
1 has nEInformation=(neType=eNB), profile 2 has nEInformation=((neType=eNB)
and (Id=1)) ).

### 4.3.6 SwMProcess
#### 4.3.6.1 Definition
This object class is a sub-class of genManProcess . It describes the SW
management process for an NE. It allows the IRPManager to be informed about
the current progress of the SWM process and where stop points are set. No
intervention of the IRPManager is foreseen except to provide indication to
resume after a stop point was reached or to abort the self-configuration.
When the automated management process for an NE starts, an instance of the
swMProcess is created automatically.
The id of the swMProcess shall be identical to the identifier of the NE and
identify the swMProcess instance uniquely.
The steps in the stepInfoList shall conform to the content of the relevant
swMProfile instance.\ Example:\ If the stepsAndOfferedStopPointList of
swMProfile indicates stopPointCanBeSetBeforeThisStep for step X, then the
entry for step X in the stepInfoList of swMProcess can only have the value
stopPointIsNotSet .
When there is no relevant swMProfile at creation time of swMProcess, then the
IRPAgent creates the swMProcess based on the relevant swMCapability. In this
case preferably no stop point shall be set in the self configuration process.
When the last step of the self configuration process is completed
successfully, the swMProcess instance is deleted automatically.
When self configuration process is terminated by the IRPManager, the
swMProcess instance is deleted automatically.

The diagram reflects the definitions in the text of the following clauses.. In

## 5.2 Generic rules
\- **Rule 1:** each operation with at least one input parameter supports a
pre-condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
\- **Rule 2:** each operation with at least one optional input parameter
supports a set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where
\"xxx\" is the name of the optional input parameter and the pre-condition
indicates that the operation supports the named optional input parameter.
Additionally, each such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
\- **Rule 3:** each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem which is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.
NOTE: These rules are mapped at the solution set level. Pre-conditions and
exceptions, generated by these rules, need not appear explicitly in the
present document.

### 5.3.1 Operation listSwMCapabilities (M)
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
This operation allows the IRPManager to determine on the Itf-N interface which
steps in the SW management are performed in NEs of a certain type, what is
done by the NE in case a step does not perform normally and before which steps
a stop point can be set, such that the software download halts and waits for a
continuation request by the IRPManager.
