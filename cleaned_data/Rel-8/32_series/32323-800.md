# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.321: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements\"
**32.322: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Information
Service (IS)\"**
**32.323: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)\"**
32.325: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP): eXtensible Markup
Language (XML) definitions\"
A 3G telecommunication network is composed of a multitude of different Network
Elements (NE). For a successful operation of the network the operator must be
provided with mechanisms allowing him to manage the network. These management
activities can be grouped into several areas: configuration management, fault
management, performance management, accounting management and security
management.
A management function assisting in different high level management areas such
as fault management and performance management is test management. The purpose
of testing is to get information about the functionality and performance of
the 3G managed network subject to the test.
The present document is part of a TS-family defining defining the
Telecommunication Management (TM) of 3G systems. The TM principles are
described in 3GPP TS 32.101 [5]. The TM architecture is described in 3GPP TS
32.102 [6]. The other specifications define the interface (Itf-N) between the
managing system (manager), which is in general the Network Manager (NM) and
the managed system (agent), which is either an Element Manager (EM) or the
managed NE itself. The Itf-N is composed of a number of Integration Reference
Points (IRPs) defining the information in the agent that is visible for the
manager, the operations that the manager may perform on this information and
the notifications that are sent from the agent to the manager. One of these
IRPs is the Test IRP.
Each IRP is specified by the requirements part, the Information Service part,
the CORBA SS and the CMIP SS.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the CORBA SS for the IRP whose semantics is
specified in Test Management IRP IS (3GPP TS 32.322 [6]).
Clause 1 to 3 provides background information. Clause 4 provides key
architectural features supporting the SS. Clause 5 defines the mapping of
operations, notification, parameters and attributes defined in IS to their SS
equivalents. Clause 6 describes the notification interface containing the push
method. Annex A contains the IDL specification.
This Solution Set specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.322 V7.2.X.

## 3.3 IRP document version number string
The IRP document version number (sometimes called \"IRP version\" or \"version
number\") string is used to identify the present document. The definition of
\"IRP document version number string\" in 3GPP TS 32.311 [8] provides the rule
to derive such a string.
This string is returned in get_test_management_IRP_versions method and is
carried in the first field of the notification header of all notifications
related to Test Management IRP. This string is also returned in
get_notification_categories method of the Notification IRPAgent, in case that
IRPAgent is responsible for emitting notifications related to Test Management
IRP.
# 4 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of Test Management IRP is specified in 3GPP
TS 32.322 [6]. The present document specifies features that are specific to
the CORBA SS.
## 4.1 Notification Services
In implementations of CORBA SS, IRPAgent conveys Test Management information
to IRPManager via OMG Notification Service (OMG Notification Service [1]).
OMG Event Service [2] provides event routing and distribution capabilities.
OMG Notification Service provides, in addition to Event Service, event
filtering and Quality of Service (QoS) as well.
A necessary and sufficient sub set of OMG Notification Services shall be used
to support TestManagementIRPNotifications notifications as specified in 3GPP
TS 32.322 [6].
## 4.2 Push and Pull Style
OMG Notification Service defines two styles of interaction. One is called push
style. In this style, IRPAgent pushes notifications to IRPManager as soon as
they are available. The other is called pull style. In this style, IRPAgent
keeps the notifications till IRPManager requests for them.
The Notification CORBA SS in 3GPP TS 32.303 [5] specifies that support of Push
style is Mandatory (M) and that support of Pull style is Optional (O).
## 4.3 Support multiple notifications in one push operation
For efficiency reasons, IRPAgent may send multiple notifications using one
single push operation. To pack multiple notifications into one push operation,
IRPAgent may wait and not invoke the push operation as soon as notifications
are available. To avoid IRPAgent to wait for an extended period of time that
is objectionable to IRPManager, IRPAgent shall implement an IRPAgent wide
timer configurable by administrator. On expiration of this timer, IRPAgent
shall invoke push if there is at least one notification to be conveyed to
IRPManager. This timer is re-started after each push invocation.
# 5 Mapping
## 5.1 Operation and Notification mapping
The Test Management IRP IS in 3GPP TS 32.322 [6] defines semantics of
operation and notification visible across the Test Management IRP. Table 1
indicates mapping of these operations and notifications to their equivalents
defined in the present SS.
Table 1: Mapping from IS Operations and Notification to SS equivalents
* * *
IS Operations/ notification TS 32.322 [6] SS Method Qualifier

NOTE: This operation is of ManagedGenericIRP IOC specified in 3GPP TS 32.312
[7].\  
The TestManagementIRP IOC of [6] inherits from it.
* * *
## 5.2 Operation parameter mapping
The Test Management IRP IS in 3GPP TS 32.322 [6] defines semantics of
parameters carried in operations across the Test Management IRP. Table2 gives
the mapping of these parameters, as per operation, to their equivalents
defined in this SS.

## 5.3 Notification parameter mapping
The Test Management IRP IS in 3GPP TS 32.322 [6] defines semantics of
parameters carried in notifications. The following table indicates the mapping
of these parameters to their OMG CORBA Structured Event (defined in OMG
Notification Service [1]) equivalents. The composition of OMG Structured
Event, as defined in the OMG Notification Service [1], is:
Header
Fixed Header
domain_name
type_name
event_name
Variable Header
Body
filterable_body_fields
remaining_body
Table 5 lists in the second column all OMG Structured Event attributes. The
first column identifies notification parameters defined in 3GPP TS 32.322 [6],
Test Management: Information Service (IS).

# 6 TestManagementIRPNotification Interface
OMG CORBA Notification push operation is used to realise the notification of
TestManagementIRPNotifications. All the notifications in this interface are
implemented using this push_structured_event method.
## 6.1 Method push (M)
module CosNotifyComm {
> ...
>
> Interface SequencePushConsumer : NotifyPublish {
>
> void push_structured_events(
>
> in CosNotification::EventBatch notifications)
>
> raises( CosEventComm::Disconnected);
>
> ...
>
> }; // SequencePushConsumer
>
> ...
}; // CosNotifyComm
NOTE 1: The push_structured_events method takes an input parameter of type
EventBatch as defined in the OMG CosNotification module (OMG Notification
Service [1]). This data type is the same as a sequence of Structured Events.
Upon invocation, this parameter will contain a sequence of Structured Events
being delivered to IRPManager by IRPAgent to which it is connected.
NOTE 2: The maximum number of events that will be transmitted within a single
invocation of this operation is controlled by IRPAgent wide configuration
parameter.
NOTE 3: The amount of time the supplier (IRPAgent) of a sequence of Structured
Events will accumulate individual events into the sequence before invoking
this operation is controlled by IRPAgent wide configuration parameter as well.
NOTE 4: IRPAgent may push EventBatch with only one Structured Event.
