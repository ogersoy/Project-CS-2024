# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
TS 32.421: \"Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace concepts and
requirements\";
TS 32.422: \"Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace control and configuration
management \";
**TS 32.423: \"Subscriber and equipment trace; Trace data definition and
management\";**
Subscriber and MS Trace provide very detailed information at call level on one
or more specific mobile(s). This data is an additional source of information
to Performance Measurements and allows going further in monitoring and
optimisation operations.
Contrary to Performance Measurements, which are a permanent source of
information, Trace is activated on user demand for a limited period of time
for specific analysis purpose
Trace plays a major role in activities such as determination of the root cause
of a malfunctioning mobile, advanced troubleshooting, optimisation of resource
usage and quality, RF coverage control and capacity improvement, dropped call
analysis, Core Network and UTRAN end to end 3G procedure validation.
The capability to log data on any interface at call level for a specific user
(e.g. IMSI) or mobile type (e.g. IMEI or IMEISV) allows getting information
which cannot be deduced from Performance Measurements such as perception of
end-user QoS during his call (e.g. requested QoS vs. provided QoS),
correlation between protocol messages and RF measurements, or interoperability
with specific mobile vendors.
Moreover, Performance Measurements provide values aggregated on an observation
period, Subscriber and Equipment Trace give instantaneous values for a
specific event (e.g. call, location update, etc.).
If Performance Measurements are mandatory for daily operations, future network
planning and primary trouble shooting, Subscriber and MS Trace is the easy way
to go deeper into investigation and 3G network optimisation.
In order to produce this data, Subscriber and MS trace are carried out in the
NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an
external system (e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for
further evaluation).
# 1 Scope
The present document describes Trace data definition and management. It covers
the trace records content, their format and transfer.
The objectives of the present document are:
  * To provide the descriptions for a standard set of Trace data;
  * To define the common format of trace records; and
  * To define a method for Trace results reporting across the management interfaces.
Clause 4 details the various Trace records content, Annex A provides Trace
report file format, Annex B provides the trace report file conventions and
transfer procedure, Annex C provides the trace reporting functional
architecture and Annex D provides some trace files examples. Trace concepts
and requirements are covered in TS 32.421 [2] while Trace control and
configuration management are described in 3GPP TS 32.422 [3].
The definition of Trace data is intended to result in comparability of Trace
data produced in a multi-vendor wireless UMTS and/or EPS network.
The following is beyond the scope of the present document, and therefore the
present document does not describe:
\- Any notification mechanisms or IRPs for trace. Only file transfer mechanism
is specified for trace data transfer;
\- Any data compression mechanisms for trace data transfer;
\- Any Trace capability limitations (e.g. maximum number of simultaneous
traced mobiles for a given NE).
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions, which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 4 Trace Record Contents
## 4.1 General
The trace reference, trace type and operation system identification are all
provided on trace activation.\ Each record may contain an MSC Server, MGW,
SGSN, GGSN, S-CSCF, P-CSCF, UTRAN, HSS, MME, Serving GW, or E-UTRAN event
record. A key is included in the table indicating whether or not the field is
mandatory.
The following table shows the template for trace record description for
minimum and medium trace depth:
* * *
Interface name Protocol name IE name Message name(s) Trace depth Notes  
**Min** **Med**
* * *
**Interface name** : Contains the name of the interface, where the IE is
available.
**Protocol name** : Contains the protocol name on the interface, where the IE
is available.
**IE name** : The name of the Information Element, which should be decoded.
**Message name(s):** The name of the message(s), where the IE is included.
**Trace depth** : Shows in which trace depth the IE should be recorded. It
also classifies whether the IE is mandatory in the trace record or not (M, O
or X: meaning described in the previous table)
* * *
**M** Mandatory This field must be in the trace record if it is available,
i.e. if the message appears during the trace recording session and the IE is
present in the message. **O** Optional This field is optional and its support
is a matter for agreement between equipment manufacturer and network operator.
**X** Not applicable This field is not required in this instance.
* * *
**NOTE** : Any kind of comments related to the IE can be made here. Also this
is the placeholder for referencing the relevant 3GPP specifications, which
define the IE.
## 4.2 MSC Server Trace Record Content
The following table shows the trace record content for MSC Server.\ The trace
record is the same for management based activation and for signalling based
activation.\ For MSC Server, the Minimum level of detail shall be supported.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Trace Report File Format
This annex describes the format of trace result files. Those files are to be
transferred from the network (NEs or EM) to the NM.
The following conditions have been considered for the definition of this file
format:
\- The trace data volume and trace duration is not predictable. Depending on
the data retrieval and storage mechanisms, several consecutive trace result
files could be generated for a single traced call. The file naming convention
shall allow rebuilding the temporal file sequences.
\- Since the files are transferred via a machine-machine interface, the files
should be machine-readable using standard tools.
\- The file format should be independent from the data transfer protocol used
to carry the file from one system to another.
\- The file format should be generic across UMTS and EPS systems.
\- The file format should be flexible enough to support further trace data
types and decoded IEs, as well as vendor specific trace data.

###### ## Annex B (normative): Trace Report File Conventions and Transfer
Procedure
This annex describes naming conventions of files containing trace results and
the procedure to transfer these files from the network to the NM.
# B.1 File naming convention
The following convention shall be applied for trace result file naming:
\\.\‑\.\.[\].[\]
1) The Type field indicates if the file contains trace data for single or
multiple calls, where:
\- \"A\" means single Trace Recording Session, single sender NE
\- \"B\" means multiple Trace Recording Sessions, single sender NE
\- \"C\" means IMSI/IMEI (SV) information for cell traffic trace
2) The Startdate field indicates the date of the first record in the trace
file. The Startdate field is of the form YYYYMMDD, where:
\- YYYY is the year in four-digit notation;
\- MM is the month in two digit notation (01 - 12);
\- DD is the day in two digit notation (01 - 31).
3) The Starttime field indicates the time of the first record in the trace
file. The Starttime field is of the form HHMMshhmm, where:
\- HH is the two digit hour of the day (local time), based on 24 hour clock
(00 - 23);
\- MM is the two digit minute of the hour (local time),
\- s is the sign of the local time differential from UTC (+ or -), in case the
time differential to UTC is 0 then the sign may be arbitrarily set to \"+\" or
\"-\";
\- hh is the two digit number of hours of the local time differential from UTC
(00-23);
\- mm is the two digit number of minutes of the local time differential from
UTC (00-59).
4) SenderType field is the type of NE defined by IOC attribute
managedElementType in 3GPP TS 32.622 [12] that recorded and sent the trace
file; SenderName field is the identifier of the NE that recorded and sent the
trace file.
5) TraceRecordingSessionReference field is set only if the type field is A.
6) TraceReference field is set if the type field is A. For type B the Trace
Reference is optional and will be used when one trace file is created per
trace session with multiple trace recording session.
7) Trace Reference is set if the type field is C.
Some examples describing file naming convention:
1) file name: A20030225.2315+0200-RNC.RNC01.01.125,
meaning: file produced by RNC\ on February 25, 2003, first trace record
at 23:15 local with a time differential of +2 hours against UTC. The file
contains trace data for the Trace Session with the Trace reference 01 and for
the Trace Recording Session with the reference 125.
2) file name: B20030115.1700-0300-RNC.RNC02,
meaning: file produced by RNC\ on January 15, 2003, first trace record
at 17:00 local with a time differential of -3 hours against UTC. The file
contains trace data for several Trace Recording Sessions.
3) file name: B20030115.1700-0300-RNC.RNC02.01,
meaning: file produced by RNC\ on January 15, 2003, first trace record
at 17:00 local with a time differential of -3 hours against UTC. The file
contains trace data for Trace reference 01 and several Trace Recording
Sessions.
4) file name C20030115.1700-0300-MME.MME02.300
Meaning: file produced by MME\ on January 15, 2003, first trace record
at 17:00 local with a time differential of -3 hours against UTC. The file
contains IMSI/IMEI (SV) information for one or more UEs traced at eNB with
Trace Reference 300.
