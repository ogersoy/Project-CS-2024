Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
**32.311: \"Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management;
Requirements\".**
**32.312: \"Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management; Information
Service (IS)\".**
32.313: \"Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management; **Common
Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)** Solution Set (SS)\".
32.317: \"**Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management; SOAP
Solution Set (SS**)\".
The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of Integration Reference Points
(IRPs) and a related Name Convention, which realise the functional
capabilities over this interface. The basic structure of the IRPs is defined
in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
The IRPs support a set of common services. Those features allow to retrieve
IRP profile and IRP supported versions. The present document contains the
requirements of those common services.
# 1 Scope
The purpose of the present document is to define a common service supported by
all IRPs such as AlarmIRP. The present document is the \"Requirements\" part.
It defines the requirements that shall be fulfilled by all IRPs, such as
AlarmIRP, supporting this common service.
With this common service supported by all IRPs, an IRPManager shall be able to
retrieve the profile of operations and notifications supported by a given IRP
which is name-contained by an IRPAgent. An IRPManager shall also be able to
retrieve the IRPVersions supported by the given IRP.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2] and the following apply:
**IRP:** see 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
**IRPAgent:** see 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
**IRPManager:** see 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
**IRP document version number string:** the IRP document version number
(sometimes called \"IRPVersion\") string is used to identify a particular IRP
Solution Set (SS) specification. It is derived using the following rule:
  * Take the 3GPP TS version number on the front page of the SS specification, such as \"3GPP TS 32.111-3 (V4.1.0)\". Discard the leading \"3GPP TS\". Discard all characters after and including the last period. Eliminate leading and trailing spaces. Reduce multiple consecutive spaces with one space. Express the resultant in a string. Capitalise the string.
EXAMPLE: If the 3GPP document version number is \"3GPP TS 32.111-3 V4.1.0
(2001-09)\", then the IRP document version number shall be \"32.111-3 V4.1\".\
If the 3GPP document version number is \"3GPP TS 32.303 V4.1.0 (2001-09)\",
then the IRP document version number shall be \"32.303 V4.1\".
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations apply:
CM Configuration Management
EM Element Manager
IRP Integration Reference Point
IS Information Service
NE Network Element
NM Network Manager
SS Solution Set
# 4 Generic IRP functions over Itf-N
The requirements for the generic IRP service over Itf-N are provided in the
following clauses.
## 4.1 Version retrieval function
An IRPAgent may support one or multiple IRP instances simultaneously (e.g.
AlarmIRP instances, BulkCMIRP instances, etc.).
The set of capabilities of each IRP instance is fully identified by the
version number of the corresponding IRP specification (i.e. the "IRP document
version number string" or in short, the IRPVersion; see clause 3.1.).
An IRP instance shall provide a function to allow IRPManager to retrieve all
its (i.e. IRP instance's) supported IRPVersion(s) over Itf-N.
An IRPManager may then decide if it wants to communicate with the IRP
instance.
## 4.2 Profiles retrieval functions
Each IRP supported by an IRPAgent provides a set of operations and
notifications. It is possible to define in each IRP Information Service (IS)
some operations and notification that are optional, which means that the final
implementation of those operations and notifications is vendor dependant.
Similarly, some parameters of operations and notifications may be defined as
optional in the IRP IS.
It shall be possible for an IRPManager to retrieve over Itf-N the profile of
an IRP of a given version: the profile shall provide information such as name
of supported operations and notifications, and the list of supported
parameters for each supported operation and notification.
