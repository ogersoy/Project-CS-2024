# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.371: \"Security Management concept and requirements\".
**32.372: \"Security Services for Integration Reference Points (IRP):
Information Service (IS)\".**

**32.375 \"Security Services for Integration Reference Points (IRP): File
integrity solution\".**
In 3GPP SA5 context, IRPs are introduced to address process interfaces at the
Itf-N interface. The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of IRPs and a
related Name Convention, which realize the functional capabilities over this
interface. The basic structure of the IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1]
and 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].\ An IRP consists of IRPManager and IRPAgent. Usually
there are three types of transaction between IRPManager and IRPAgent, which
are: operation invocation, notification, and file transfer.
However, there are different types of intentional threats against the
transaction between IRPManagers and IRPAgents. All the threats are potential
risks of damage or degradation of telecommunication services, which operators
should take measures to reduce or eliminate to secure the telecommunication
service, network, and data.
The present document is applicable to the Interface IRP specifications. That
is to say, it is only concerned with the security aspects of
operations/notifications/file deployed across the Itf-N.
The present document introduces XML Signature mechanism to address File
Integrity security requirement defined in 3GPP TS 32.371 [4].
# 1 Scope

solution whose semantics are specified in 3GPP TS 32.372 [5].

# 4 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of Security Service is specified in 3GPP TS
32.372 [5]. This clause specifies features that are specific to the File
integrity solution.
## 4.1 Principles of IRP Security Services
Figure 4.1 shows that Security Services are between IRP Application layer and
Transport layer. Security Attributes which are attached to network management
information are transferred between IRPManager and IRPAgent to address
Authentication, Authorization, Activity Log and file integrity requirements.
Figure 4.1 : Principles of IRP Security Service
The basic idea of these Security Services is as follows:
  * IRP Security Services on IRPManager side and IRP Security Services on IRPAgent side co-operate to provide Security Services for IRP.\ This avoids modifying IRPManager and IRPAgent much.
  * When the IRPManager and/or IRPAgent send network management information to each other, the IRP Security Service (on IRPManager and/or IRPAgent side) attaches Security Attributes to the network management information. The receiver works with the attached Security Attributes to implement the IRP security requirement.
The present document addresses File integrity solution by using the XML
Signature Mechanism defined by [9].
Table 4.1 identifies the use of File Integrity solution to realize File
Integrity Security Service.

## 4.2 XML Signature Recommendation
This clause introduces the concept of XML Signature detailed in [9]. It is
used to transfer XML Signature over Itf-N to provide the File Integrity
Security Service.
Based on [9], data to be signed is canonicalized by using a specific method,
i.e. using a unique form to represent XML files with the same semantic content
but different text. The canonicalized data may be transformed before it is
digested by using a specific method. The digest value is encrypted by using a
specific signature method. The key information used to verify the signed value
of signed data may be included in the XML Signature.
As shown in [9], XML digital signatures are represented by the Signature
element which has the following structure (where \"?\" denotes zero or one
occurrence; \"+\" denotes one or more occurrences; and \"*\" denotes zero or
more occurrences):
\
\
\
\
(\

# 5 Mapping
## 5.1 File Integrity Solution Mapping
### 5.1.1 Security Attribute Mapping
In File Integrity Solution scenario, XML Signature as Security Attributes is
exchanged over Itf-N accompanying the file(s) to be transferred.

### 5.1.2 Operation Mapping
Editor\'s note: FFS.
# 6 Itf-N Security Service Behaviour
This clause describes some behaviour of IRPManager and IRPAgent not captured
by XML Schema in File Integrity Solution.
## 6.1 File Integrity Solution
This clause addresses how to use XML Signature to provide File Integrity
Security Service.
To Enable IRPManager and IRPAgent to use XML Signature, these two sides should
agree with Canonicalization Method, Transform Method, Digest Method, and
Signature Method before they start communication.\ Mandatory methods defined
in [9] should be supported by IRPManager and IRPAgent.
When an XML document instance is to be exchanged over Itf-N, the sender should
make sure the whole XML document instance should be signed. The corresponding
XML Signature should be held in the XML document instance.
When an XML document instance is received, the receiver should verify the XML
document instance by using the process defined in [9].
If the verification is successful, receiver works with the XML document
instance as normal; otherwise receiver should raise a security alarm if it is
IRPAgent or process the failure in a vendor specific way if it is IRPManager.
