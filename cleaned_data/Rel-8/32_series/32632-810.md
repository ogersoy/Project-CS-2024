# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.631: **\"** Configuration Management (CM); Core network resources
Integration Reference Point (IRP): Requirements\".
**32.632: \"Configuration Management (CM); Core network resources Integration
Reference Point (IRP): Network Resource Model (NRM)\".**
32.633: \"Configuration Management (CM); Core network resources Integration
Reference Point (IRP): Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
Solution Set (SS)\".
32.635: \"Configuration Management (CM); Core network resources Integration
Reference Point (IRP): Bulk CM eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file format
definition\".
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimization programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
\"Core Network Resources IRP\", through which an \'IRPAgent\' (typically an
Element Manager or Network Element) can communicate Configuration Management
information to one or several \'IRPManagers\' (typically Network Managers)
concerning CN resources.
The present document specifies the protocol neutral Core Network Resources
IRP: Network Resource Model. It reuses relevant parts of the generic NRM in
3GPP TS 32.622 [16], either by direct reuse or sub-classing, and in addition
to that defines CN specific Information Object Classes.
Finally, in order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface
IRP is needed, such as the Basic CM IRP 3GPP TS 32.60x [17]. However, which
Interface IRP that is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2], 3GPP TS 32.600 [14] and the following
apply:
**Association:** In general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
(1) name bindings;
(2) reference attributes; and
(3) association objects.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams).
**Managed Element (ME):** an instance of the Information Object Class
ManagedElement defined in 3GPP TS 32.622 [16].
**Managed Object (MO):** in the context of the present document, a Managed
Object (MO) is a software object that encapsulates the manageable
characteristics and behaviour of a particular Network Resource. The MO is
instance of a MO class defined in a MIM/NRM. This class, called **Information
Object Class (IOC)** has _attributes_ that provide information used to
characterize the objects that belong to the class (the term \"attribute\" is
taken from TMN and corresponds to a \"property\" according to CIM).
Furthermore, the IOC can have _operations_ that represent the behaviour
relevant for that class (the term \"operation\" is taken from TMN and
corresponds to a \"method\" according to CIM). The IOC may support the
emission of _notifications_ that provide information about an event occurrence
within a network resource.
**Management Information Model (MIM):** also referred to as NRM - see the
definition below.
**Network Resource Model (NRM):** a model representing the actual managed
telecommunications network resources that a System is providing through the
subject IRP\ An NRM identifies and describes IOCs, their associations,
attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as \"MIM\" (see above),
which originates from the ITU-T TMN.
**Node B: a** logical node responsible for radio transmission/reception in one
or more cells to/from the User Equipment\ It terminates the Iub interface
towards the RNC.

# 4 System overview
## 4.1 Compliance rules
The following defines the meaning of Mandatory and Optional IOC attributes and
associations between IOCs, in Solution Sets to the IRP defined by the present
document:
  * The IRPManager shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. > The IRPManager shall be prepared to receive information related to > mandatory as well as optional attributes/associations without > failure; however the IRPManager does not have to support handling > of the optional attributes/associations.
  * The IRPAgent shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. It > may support optional attributes/associations.
An IRPAgent that incorporates vendor-specific extensions shall support normal
communication with a 3GPP SA5â€‘compliant IRPManager with respect to all
Mandatory and Optional information object classes, attributes and associations
without requiring the IRPManager to have any knowledge of the extensions.
Given that:
  * rules for vendor-specific extensions remain to be fully specified; > and
  * many scenarios under which IRPManager and IRPAgent interwork may > exist;
it is recognized that the IRPManager, even though it is not required to have
knowledge of vendor-specific extensions, may be required to be implemented
with an awareness that extensions can exist and behave accordingly.
# 5 Modelling approach
The modelling approach is described in the Generic Network Resources IRP: NRM
(3GPP TS 32.622 [16]).
It should be noted that this model allows for combined managed element
functionality, where more than one 'function IOCs\' (inherited from
ManagedFunction) modelling more specific managed element functionality may be
contained in the ManagedElement IOC.

### 6.2.1 Attributes and relationships
This clause depicts the set of IOCs that encapsulate information relevant for
this service. This clause provides the overview of all information object
classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of
various aspects of these information object classes.
The figures below show the containment/naming hierarchy and the associations
of the information object classes defined in the present document.
NOTE: The listed cardinality numbers represent transient as well as steady-
state numbers, and reflect all managed object creation and deletion scenarios
in all figures.

and is only mandatory when they belong to different ManagedElements.
Figure 6.2.1.4: CN UTRAN NRM Containment/Naming and Association
NOTE 1: The association between MscServerFunction and CsMgwFunction is
optional and is only mandatory when they belong to different ManagedElements.
NOTE 2: The association between MscServerFunction and GsmCell, and
SgsnFunction and GsmCell are optional. It may be valid if both the
MscServerFunction and GsmCell, or SgsnFunction and GsmCell are managed by the
same management node.
Figure 6.2.1.5: CN GERAN NRM Containment/Naming and Association
Each IOC is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to 3GPP TS
32.300 [13] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example, the DN of
an IOC representing a cell could have a format like:
SubNetwork=Sweden, MeContext =MEC-Gbg-1, ManagedElement =MSC-Gbg-1,
MscServerFunction=MSC-1.
