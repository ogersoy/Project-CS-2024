# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
**TS 32.432:** \"**Performance measurement: File format definition\";**
**TS 32.435: \"Performance measurement: eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file
format definition\";**
TS 32.436: \"Performance measurement: Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) file
format definition\".
The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor 3G PLMN.
During the lifetime of a PLMN, its logical and physical configuration will
undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise the
utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed through
network configuration management activities and/or network engineering, see
3GPP TS 32.600 [4].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a PLMN network require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document and the other related 3GPP TSs
listed above is to describe the mechanisms involved in the collection of the
data.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the XML file format of performance measurement
results whose semantics is defined in 3GPP TS 32.432 [5].

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**network Element Manager (EM):** provides a package of end-user functions for
management of a set of closely related types of Network Elements. These
functions can be divided into two main categories:
\- Element Management Functions for management of Network Elements on an
individual basis. These are basically the same functions as supported by the
corresponding local terminals.
\- Sub-Network Management Functions that are related to a network model for a
set of Network Elements constituting a clearly defined sub-network, which may
include relations between the Network Elements. This model enables additional
functions on the sub-network level (typically in the areas of network topology
presentation, alarm correlation, service impact analysis and circuit
provisioning).
**Network Manager (NM):** provides a package of end-user functions with the
responsibility for the management of a network, mainly as supported by the
EM(s) but it may also involve direct access to the Network Elements. All
communication with the network is based on open and well-standardised
interfaces supporting management of multi-vendor and multi-technology Network
Elements.
**Operations System (OS):** generic management system, independent of its
location level within the management hierarchy.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations apply:
3G 3^rd^ Generation
EM Element Manager
GSM Global System for Mobile communications
IRP Integration Reference Point
NE Network Element
NM Network Manager
PM Performance Management
# 4 XML file format definition
This clause describes the format of measurement result files that can be
transferred from the network (NEs or EM) to the NM. The XML file format
definition is based on XML schema (see [8], [9], [10] and [11]).
The XML file format definitions implement the measurement result structure and
parameters defined in clauses 5.2 and 5.3 of 3GPP TS 32.401 [3].
## 4.1 Mapping table
Table 4.1 maps the file content items in the 3GPP TS 32.432([5]) document to
those used in the XML schema based file format definitions. XML tag attributes
are useful where data values bind tightly to its parent element. They have
been used where appropriate.
