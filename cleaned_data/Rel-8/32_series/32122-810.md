# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
**32.121: Advanced Alarm Management (AAM) Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Requirements;**
**32.122: Advanced Alarm Management (AAM) Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Information Service (IS);**
32.123: **Advanced Alarm Management (AAM)** Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set.
The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of IRPs and a related Name
Convention, which realize the functional capabilities over this interface. The
basic structure of the IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.150 [1].
A single network fault may generate a large number of alarms over space and
time. In a large and complex network, simultaneous network faults may occur,
causing the network operator to be flooded with high volume of alarms.\ The
high volume of alarms, typically the one received by an IRPManager via the
getAlarmList or alarm notifications of Alarm IRP specification, greatly
inhibits the operator ability to quickly identify and locate the responsible
network faults. AAM IRP is intended to provide methods to improve this
situation.
# 1 Scope
The purpose of Advanced Alarm Management (AAM) IRP is to define an interface
through which an IRPManager can categorize alarm notifications.
The present document is the Information Service of AAM. It defines, for the
purpose of categorizing alarm notifications, the information observable and
controlled by management system\'s client and it also specifies the semantics
of the interactions used to carry this information.

## 5.3 Information Object Class definitions
### 5.3.1 advancedAlarmManagementRule
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
#### 5.3.1.1.1 General Definition
This information object represents an AAM Rule object instance.
An AdvancedAlarmManagementRule is fully identified by its distinguished name.
It inherits from IOC top.
An AAM Rule is a way for the IRPManager to define which alarms / alarm
clearings deliver significant or insignificant information (significant seen
with the eyes of the IRPManager) and to tell the IRPAgent not to send the
insignificant alarms / alarm clearings.
AAMRules will not screen out all insignificant alarms/alarm clearings, but
contribute to enable the network operator to reduce the number of reported
alarms to a reasonable and manageable level.
The choice of rule/s may depend on the type of alarm, the environment, the
time of day and many more.
To avoid screening of alarms which might be important for the network
operator, the user of AAM rules should apply AAMrules with careful
consideration and appropriate setting of parameters.
An AAM Rule instance is fully identified by its DNdistinguished name. A Rule
instance carries, among other things, the identification of the Rule type
called AdvancedAlarmManagementRuleType. Of these there exist the following:
  * ThresholdRule
  * TransientRule
  * ToggleRule
  * VendorSpecificRule
See Annex A for the description of the above Rules.

Interface
## 6.2 AAMIRPOperation_1 Interface (M)
### 6.2.1 Scope
This interface defines methods for the IRPManagerIRPManager to request for
alarm notifications of significant information (significant from the
IRPManager's perspective).
The definition of insignificance is determined by the IRPManager. The choice
of AAM Rule/s may depend on the type of alarm, the environment, the time of
day and many more.
An implementation can claim compliance to this IRP if it supports at least one
of the AAMRules, i.e. one of the operations defined in clause 6.2.2 up to and
including clause 6.2.5, and the mandatory operations defined in this
interface.
### 6.2.2 Operation activateAAMRule (M)
#### 6.2.2.1 Definition
This operation allows an IRPManager to activate an AAM rule (see

###### ## Annex A (normative): Advanced Alarm Management Rules
# A.1 General
It is not recommended to have several AAMRules applicable at one time for one
event. However, if YyyFunction supports and allows it, then it is vendor
specific which AAMRule is applied or not.
An AAMRule (called Rule hereafter) contains multiple elements.
The first element (subSection titled: Criterion to determine alike alarm) is a
criterion used to determine if an alarm is classified as 'alike' or \"not
alike\". If the alarm is not-alike, then the alarm is not subject to further
scrutiny (processing) by the Rule, i.e. it would be processed as if there is
no Rule in effect. The IRPManager specifies such criterion in an input
parameter named filter in various relevant AAM operations.
The second element (subSection titled: Treatment of alike alarm) is the
algorithm to determine if
a) An alike alarm should be reported as one alarm (i.e. it is a significant
alarm) or
b) The alike alarm should be suppressed (i.e. it is an insignificant alarm).
When a significant alarm is identified, the algorithm also determines:
a) The time when the notifyNew/Changed/ClearedAlarm of this significant alarm
should be sent to IRPManager and
b) The value of alarmRaisedTime, alarmChangedTime and alarmClearedTime
parameters in the relevant notifyNew/Changed/ClearedAlarm of this significant
alarm.
The third element (subSection titled: Relation to Log and AlarmList) specifies
which alarms shall enter into Log of LogIRP and AlarmList of AlarmIRP.
Each of the following subsections defines a Rule using the three-element
description outlined above.
For each Rule, illustration samples, using symbols shown below, are given
(titled: Samples). The thick horizontal line indicates a time-line. The dotted
doubleâ€‘arrow line indicates a time parameter, if applicable. The '?' box
indicates the alarm under investigation. The left-edge of a box corresponds to
the alarmRaisedTime while the right-edge corresponds to the alarmClearedTime.
So, the horizontal span of a box indicates the alarm active time span.
Figure A.1-1: Sample diagram notations
Sometimes, a shaded box is drawn below the time line as below. Such shaded box
indicates the identification of a significant alarm (to be reported alarm).\
The left-edge of the box indicates the time when the corresponding alarm
notification is sent out. This emission time is not necessarily identical to
the alarmRaised/ChangedTime within the alarm notification.\ The right-edge of
a box indicates the time when the corresponding alarm clearing notification is
sent out. This emission time is not necessarily identical to the
alarmClearedTime within the alarm notification.
Figure A.1-2: Sample diagram notations
For each Rule, use cases are given (subSection titled: Example for Use cases).
For some Rules exception handling is defined (subSection titled: Exception
Handling).
# A.2 AAM Rules
## A.2.1 Threshold Rule
### A.2.1.1 Parameters
This Rule has three parameters, namely, the alarmOccurenceThreshold (called N
here), the slidingTimeWindow (called T here) and filter.
### A.2.1.2 Criterion to determine alike alarm
The filter parameter carries values for objectInstance, alarmType,
perceivedSeverity, probableCause and specificProblem. If the alarm under
investigation (e.g. the box with a '?' in the sample below) carries the same
values, then it is considered 'alike' otherwise, \"not-alike\".
### A.2.1.3 Treatment of alike alarm
Starting value for Lower Edge of Time Window is the activation time of the
threshold rule.
Test an alike alarm.
When a new alarm matches the filter, then Lower and Upper Edge of Time Window
and count are newly determined:\ Upper Edge of Time Window becomes the time of
the new alarm.\ Lower Edge of Time Window becomes either the time of the
current Lower Edge of Time Window or the time of the new alarm minus the
default size T of the time window, whichever of these two times is later.
The count is the number of alarms between Lower and Upper Edge of Time Window
(including the new alarm).\ If the count reaches the threshold N, then the
alarm is considered as significant and the Lower Edge of Time Window becomes
the time of the alarm.
For a not reported alarm no notifyClearedAlarm shall be sent.
NotifyClearedAlarms for alarms which were reported to the IRPManager before
the activation of the threshold rule shall not be suppressed.
Table A.2.1.3-1 shows the emission times of the various related to a
significant alarm.

FigureA.2.1.5-2: Threshold Rule illustrations -- insignificant alarm
FigureA.2.1.5-3: Threshold Rule illustrations -- significant alarm
### A.2.1.6 Example for Use cases
The thresholdRule can be used to screen out alarms which are only important if
they appear repeatedly, e.g. if an alarm which is self-healing comes back
again and again,
## A.2.2 Transient Rule
### A.2.2.1 Parameters
This Rule has two parameters, namely, the minutesAtLeastActive (called T here)
and filter.
### A.2.2.2 Criterion to determine alike alarm
The filter parameter carries values for objectInstance, alarmType,
perceivedSeverity, probableCause and specificProblem. If the alarm under
investigation (e.g. the box with a '?' in the sample below) carries the
identified parameters and having the same values, then it is considered
'alike' otherwise, \"not-alike\".
### A.2.2.3 Treatment of alike alarm
Take an alike alarm. If it's period is smaller than T, then it is an
insignificant alarm; otherwise, it is a significant alarm. For a not reported
alarm no notifyClearedAlarm shall be sent.
NotifyClearedAlarms for alarms which were reported to the IRPManager before
the activation of the transientRule shall not be suppressed.
Table A.2.2.3-1 shows the emission times of the various related to significant
alarm.

the alike alarm alarmId Same value as that carried in the alike alarm.
* * *
### A.2.2.4 Relation to Log and AlarmList
The alike alarms enter the Log. The significant alarms enter the AlarmList.
### A.2.2.5 Samples
Here are two samples. One is a not-to-be reported alarm while the other is a
significant alarm.
Figure A.2.2.5-1: TransientRule Illustrations -- insignificant alarm
Figure A.2.2.5-2: TransientRule Illustrations -- significant alarm
### A.2.2.6 Example for Use cases
The transientRule can be used to screen out alarms which usually are of
temporarily nature.
## A.2.3 Toggle Rule
### A.2.3.1 Parameters
This Rule has 4 parameters, namely, the filter, the alarmOccurenceThreshold
(called N here), the slidingTimeWindowTogglingStarted (called T1 here) and
slidingTimeWIndowTogglingSettled (called T2 here).
### A.2.3.2 Criterion to determine alike alarm
The filter parameter carries values for objectInstance, alarmType,
perceivedSeverity, probableCause and specificProblem. If the alarm under
investigation (e.g. the box with a '?' in the sample below) carries the
identified parameters and having the same values, then it is considered
'alike' otherwise, \"not-alike\".
### A.2.3.3 Treatment of alike alarm
[1. Starting values]{.underline}:
Starting value for Lower Edges of Time Windows for Toggling Started/Settled is
the activation time of the toggle rule.\ Starting value for the count is
zero.\ At the beginning all alarms are \"non-toggling\"
[2. To do when alike alarm was identified]{.underline}
When a notifyNew/Changed/ClearedAlarm event matches the filter, then Lower and
Upper Edge of the Time Window TogglingStarted/Settled and count are newly
determined:
[2.1. Determine Time Window TogglingStarted]{.underline}\ Upper Edge of Time
Window TogglingStarted becomes the time of the event.\ Lower Edge of Time
Window TogglingStartedbecomes the time of the event minus the size T1 of the
time window.
[2.2. Determination of \"toggling\" (via count)]{.underline}\ The count is the
number of alike alarms between Lower and Upper Edge of Time Window
TogglingStarted (including the new alarm).\ If the count is above or equal to
the threshold N and the event was a notifyNewAlarm and the alarm was \"non-
toggling\", then the notifyNewAlarm is sent and the alarm is considered as
\"toggling\", with the consequence that further alike notifyNew/Changed/Alarm
events are regarded as not significant, until the alarm is considered as
\"non-toggling\" again.\ \ [2.3.Determine Time Window
TogglingSettled]{.underline}\ If the alarm is \"non-toggling\", then there is
no need to determine Upper and Lower Edge of Time Window TogglingSettled.\ If
the alarm is \"toggling\", then:\ Upper Edge of Time Window TogglingSettled
becomes the time of the new event plus the size T2 of the Time Window
TogglingSettled .\ Lower Edge of Time Window TogglingSettled becomes the time
of the new alarm .
[3. Return to non-toggling]{.underline}\ If the time reaches the Upper Edge of
Time Window TogglingSettled, then the alarm is considered as \"non-toggling\",
i.e. alike alarms are regarded as significant.\ If the last event was a
notifyChanged/ClearedAlarm, then the change to \"non-toggling\" triggers the
emission of the related notification.
Table A.2.3.3-1 shows the emission times of the various related to significant

Parameters of the Reported alarm Parameter values alarmRaisedTime Same value
as that carried in the alike alarm. alarmChangedTime Same value as that
carried in the alike alarm. notifyClearedTime Same value as that carried in
the last alike alarm. alarmId Same value as that carried by the first member
of a sequence.

### A.2.3.4 Relation to Log and AlarmList
The alike alarms enter the Log. The significant alarms enter the AlarmList.
### A.2.3.5 Samples
The samples below use N=3.

### A.2.3.6 Example for Use cases
The toggleRule can be used to take some burden from alarm management for cases
where an alarm comes and goes back and forth, e.g. because of some entity is
in a swinging state.
### A.2.3.7 Exception Handling
The Toggle Rule can potentially group multiple alike alarms together to form
one significant alarm. If the process executing the Rule misses the alarm
clearing time of one member of a group, then this can have the following
consequences:
If a clearing of one of the alike alarms during the toggling state is missed
(green box in Figure A.2.3.7-1), then the significant alarm would also not be
cleared (pink box continuing the dark grey in the same figure). This can be
avoided if the filter is set in a way that only alarms of one instance will
pass it and if always the latest notifyClearedAlarms triggers the start of T2.

## A.2.4 Definition of vendor specific rule
It is possible to implement vendor specific AAMRules. No specific definitions
are supplied here.
# A.3 Relation of Rule and Notification filter
This clause illustrates the relation between the AAM capabilities and the
NotificationIRP and AlarmIRP.
The following diagram illustrates the case when AAM capabilities are not
deployed. The \"1, 2.. 6\" indicates 6 alarms. They will be logged and they
would appear in the AlarmList. The NotificationIRP supported a filter F1.\ The
IRPManager, in this case, receives \"1, 3\" where '2, 4, 5, 6' were discarded
because of Notification filter F1 is in effect.
Figure A.3-1: Deployment without AAM capabilities
The following diagram illustrates the case when AAM capabilities are deployed.
The \"1, 2.. 6\" indicates 6 alarms. They will be logged. Because of AAMRule
R1 is in effect, the \"\"1,2...6\" result in two significant alarms, A and B.
The A and B will appear in AlarmList. They will also be broadcasted to
IRPManagers subject to NotificationIRP filter in effect. In the case below,
the IRPManager would receive only A because Notification IRP filter F2 is in
effect.
