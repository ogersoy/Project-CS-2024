Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
\"Signalling Transport Network (STN) network resources IRP\", through which an
\"IRPAgent\" (typically an Element Manager or Network Element) can communicate
Configuration Management information to one or several \"IRPManagers\"
(typically Network Managers) concerning Signalling Transport resources. This
IRP comprises a set of specifications defining Requirements, a protocol
neutral Network Resource Model (NRM) and corresponding Solution Set(s).
The present document specifies the protocol neutral STN resources IRP NRM. It
reuses relevant parts of the generic NRM in TS 32.622 [6], either by direct
reuse or sub-classing, and in addition to that defines Signalling Transport
specific Managed Object Classes.
The Configuration Management (CM) area is very large. The intention is to
split the specification of the related interfaces in several IRPs - as
described in the Introduction clause above. An important aspect of such a
split is that the NRMs defined in different IRPs containing NRMs are
consistent, and that NRMs supported by an IRPAgent implementation can be
accessed as one coherent model through one IRP Information Service (IS).
To summarize, the present document has the following main purpose: to define
the applied Signalling Transport Network specific NRM, based on the generic
NRM in 3GPP TS 32.622 [6].
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an IRP IS is needed,
such as the Basic CM IRP: IS (TS 32.602 [7]) or the Bulk CM IRP: IS (TS 32.612
[8]). However, which IS is applicable is outside the scope of this document.
Finally, regarding the support of the State Management IRP: IS (TS 32.672
[3]), all NRMs of one release shall support the same State Management IRP
version.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions in 3GPP TS
32.101 [1], 32.102 [2], 32.600 [5], 32.741 [25] and the following apply:
**Association:** in general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
> 1\. name bindings;
>
> 2\. reference attributes; and
>
> 3\. association objects.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams).
**Managed Element (ME):** an instance of the Managed Object Class
ManagedElement defined in 3GPP TS 32.622 [6].
**Managed Object (MO):** in the context of the present document, a Managed
Object (MO) is a software object that encapsulates the manageable
characteristics and behaviour of a particular Network Resource. The MO is
instance of a MO class defined in a MIM/NRM. This class, called **Information
Object Class (IOC)** has **attributes** that provide information used to
characterize the objects that belong to the class (the term \"attribute\" is
taken from TMN and corresponds to a \"property\" according to CIM).
Furthermore, the IOC can have **operations** that represent the behaviour
relevant for that class (the term \"operation\" is taken from TMN and
corresponds to a \"method\" according to CIM). The IOC may support the
emission of **notifications** that provide information about an event
occurrence within a network resource.
**Management Information Model (MIM):** also referred to as NRM - see the
definition below.
**Network Resource Model (NRM):** A model representing the actual managed
telecommunications network resources that a System is providing through the
subject IRP. An NRM identifies and describes the IOCs, their associations,
attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as \"MIM\" (see above),
which originates from the ITU-T TMN.

# 4 Modelling approach
The modelling approach used in this IRP is described in 3GPP TS 32.150 [26]
and 32.622 [6] Generic Network Resources IRP; NRM.
This model allows for combined managed element functionality, where more than
one \"function IOC\" (inherited from ManagedFunction) modelling more specific
managed element functionality may be contained in the ManagedElement IOC.

## 5.4 Information relationship definitions
### 5.4.1 ConnectedTo1 (M)
#### 5.4.1.1 Definition
This represents a uni-directional relation between the M3UARouteNePart and
M3UALinkSetTP.
The role of the relation shall be mapped to a reference attribute of the IOC.
