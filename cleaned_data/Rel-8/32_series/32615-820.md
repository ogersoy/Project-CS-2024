# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:

Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Element (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or functions in the Operations Systems
(OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as a single action on a NE of the 3G network or
as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the main part of the XML file format definition
for the Bulk Configuration Management IRP IS in 3GPP TS 32.612 [1].
The other parts of this XML file format definition are NRM-specific parts.
Those NRM-specific parts are provided by 3GPP TS 32.625 [11], 32.635 [12],
32.645 [13], 32.655 [14], 32.695 [16], 32.715 [17], 32.735 [18] and 32.745
[15].
Bulk CM XML file formats are based on XML [2], XML Schema [3] [4] [5] and XML
Namespace [6] standards.
This File Format Definition specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.612 V8.1.X.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
**XML file:** a file containing an XML document.
**XML document:** see [2]; in the scope of this specification, an XML document
is composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration followed by a
root XML element.
**XML declaration:** see [2]; it specifies the version of XML and the
character encoding being used.
**XML element:** see [2]; an XML element has a type, is identified by a name,
may have a set of XML attribute specifications and is either composed of the
succession of an XML start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element
followed by an XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag;
each XML element may contain other XML elements.
**empty XML element:** see [2]; an XML element having an empty XML content; an
empty XML element still possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an
empty XML element is either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag
directly followed by an XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-
element tag.
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag.
**XML start-tag:** see [2]; the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked
by an XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute
specifications of the XML element.
**XML end-tag:** see [2]; the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML end-tag containing the name of the XML element.
**XML empty-element tag:** see [2]; an empty XML element is composed simply of
an empty-element tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute
specifications of the XML element.
**XML attribute specification:** see [2]; an XML attribute specification has a
name and a value.
**DTD:** see [2]; a DTD defines structure and content constraints to be
respected by an XML document to be valid with regard to this DTD.
**XML schema:** see [3], [4] and [5]; more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema
defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML document
to conform with this XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML
schemas can be used together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself
also an XML document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas.
**XML namespace:** see [6]; in the scope of this specification, enables
qualifying element and attribute names used in XML documents by associating
them with namespaces identified by different XML schemas.
**XML complex type:** see [3], [4] and [5]; defined in an XML schema; cannot
be directly used in an XML document; can be the concrete type or the
derivation base type for an XML element type or for another XML complex type;
ultimately defines constraints for an XML element on its XML attribute
specifications and/or its XML content.
**XML element type:** see [3], [4] and [5]; declared by an XML schema; can be
directly used in an XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element,
directly or indirectly defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications
and/or its XML content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base
type for another XML element type.

# 4 Structure and content of configuration data XML files
The present clause defines the file format of configuration data XML files
exchanged between an IRPManager and an IRPAgent as part of upload and download
operations of the Bulk CM IRP IS (see [1]).
Upload and download configuration data XML files share a common file format
defined by the XML schema in Annex A and by the following clauses.
Additionally, vendor-specific XML schemas shall be provided to enable
configuration data XML files to carry vendor-specific data (see clause 4.5).
The use of XML schemas enables to ensure configuration data XML files have the
proper structure and to some extent the proper content, and in particular to
ensure:
\- for a given NRM instance, it is properly named/positioned with regard to
the global NRM naming tree;
\- for a given NRM instance, only attributes of the corresponding NRM class
are present;
\- for a given NRM attribute, its value is of the proper type.
Location of the XML schemas used for configuration data XML files is outside
the scope of this document.
## 4.1 Global structure
The content of a configuration data XML file is the succession of:
\- the standard XML declaration with specification of the version of XML and
of the character encoding being used (see [2]);
> \- a bulkCmConfigDataFile XML element; this is the root XML element of
> configuration data XML files.
The definition of the allowed character encoding(s) is outside the scope of
this document.
As defined by the following extract of XML schema configData.xsd (see Annex
A):
\\ \\ \\
\\ [...]\ \\ \\ [...]\ \\ \\ [...]\ \\ \\ \\
\
the XML content of a bulkCmConfigDataFile XML element is the succession of:
> \- a fileHeader XML element (see clause 4.2);
>
> \- one or several configData XML elements (see clause 4.3);
>
> \- a fileFooter XML element (see clause 4.2).
XML elements fileHeader and fileFooter are empty XML elements (see clause
4.2).
The bulkCmConfigDataFile XML element shall also have all the XML attribute
specifications that declare the XML namespaces (see [6]) used in the XML file.
The following XML namespaces are potentially used in configuration data XML
files:
\- the default XML namespace is associated with the configuration data files
base XML schema configData.xsd (see Annex A);
\- for each NRM-specific XML schema, a specific XML namespace prefix is
defined for the associated XML namespace (see clause 4.3A.1);
\- XML namespaces prefixes starting with vs, e.g. vsRHO11, are reserved for
the XML namespaces associated with the vendor-specific XML schemas (see clause
4.5).
Each configData XML element (see clause 4.3) carries:
\- NRM instances with or without their NRM attribute values in a NRM naming
tree organized structure together with modifier XML attribute specification
(see clause 4.4);
\- possibly vendor-specific data (see clause 4.5).
A configData XML element can carry an entire tree of NRM instances with their
NRM attribute values and the related vendor-specific data or any subset of it.
The following is an example of a configuration data XML file, without
presentation of the XML attribute specifications and XML content of
fileHeader, configData and fileFooter XML elements (replaced by [...]; see
clauses 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5):
\\ \\ \\ \\ [...]\ \\
\\ [...]\ \\ \\
\
## 4.2 XML elements fileHeader and fileFooter
### 4.2.1 XML element fileHeader
As defined by the following extract of XML schema configData.xsd (see Annex
A):
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
\
a fileHeader XML element:
\- has the following XML attribute specifications:
\- a fileFormatVersion XML attribute specification; this attribute
specification carries the abridged number and version of this 3GPP document
(see below); this identifies the version of the file format used for
assembling the XML file;
\- a conditional senderName XML attribute specification; this attribute
specification shall be present only in XML files generated by the IRPAgent; it
carries the DN of the IRPAgent that assembled the XML file, i.e. the value of
the systemDN NRM attribute of the IRPAgent NRM instance (see [8]);
\- a conditional vendorName XML attribute specification; this attribute
specification shall be present only in XML files generated by the IRPAgent; it
carries the name of the vendor of the IRPAgent that assembled the XML file;
> \- and has an empty XML content.
The abridged number and version of a 3GPP document is constructed from its
version specific full reference \"3GPP [...] (yyyy-mm)\" by:
\- removing the leading \"3GPP TS\";
\- removing everything including and after the version third digit,
representing editorial only changes, together with its preceding dot
character;
\- from the resulting string, removing leading and trailing white space,
replacing every multi character white space by a single space character and
changing the case of all characters to uppercase.
The following is an example of a fileHeader XML element:
\
### 4.2.2 XML element fileFooter
As defined by the following extract of XML schema configData.xsd (see Annex
A):
\\ \\ \\ \\ \
a fileFooter XML element:
\- has a dateTime XML attribute specification; this attribute specification
carries the date and time the XML file was assembled;
> \- and has an empty XML content.
The following is an example of a fileFooter XML element:
\
## 4.3 XML element configData
As defined by the following extract of XML schema configData.xsd (see Annex
A):
\\ \\
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\
\\
\\ \
a configData XML element:
\- has an optional dnPrefix XML attribute specification; this attribute
specification carries the DN Prefix information as defined in Annex C of 3GPP
TS 32.300 [7];
> \- and its XML content is an instance of the specific type of XML element
> (see below) corresponding to one of the NRM classes SubNetwork, MeContext or
> ManagedElement (see [8]); depending on the System Context of the IRP (see
> [1]) the used NRM class shall be:
>
> \- in case of System Context A, only SubNetwork NRM class, or;
>
> \- in case of System Context B, only MeContext or ManagedElement NRM class.
This instance of SubNetwork/MeContext/ManagedElement NRM class corresponding
specific XML element type is the starting point for a configData XML element
to possibly contain several NRM instances in a NRM naming tree organized
structure (see clause 4.3A.2).
The following is an example of a configData XML element:
\\ \\ [...]\
\\ \
## 4.3A NRM-specific XML elements
NRM-specific XML element types are generically defined under the mapping rules
defined in clause 4.3A.2.
NRM-specific XML element types are explicitly declared by NRM-specific XML
schemas as defined in clause 4.3A.1.
### 4.3A.1 NRM-specific XML schemas
NRM-specific XML schemas are defined in the NRM-specific parts (see clause 1)
of the XML file format definition for the Bulk Configuration Management IRP IS
[1].
NRM-specific XML schemas with definition of corresponding XML namespace
prefixes (see clause 4.1) are listed by the following table:

* * *
Each NRM-specific XML schema explicitly declares NRM-specific XML element
types for the related NRM.
Additionally, XML schema genericNrm.xsd (see [11]) also provides global XML
declarations and definitions for the support of:
\- NRM-specific XML element type declaration;
\- vendor-specific XML element type declaration (see clause 4.5).
### 4.3A.2 Generic mapping rules
NRM-specific XML element types are generically defined under the following
mapping rules:
\- to each NRM class corresponds a specific type of XML element having the
following characteristics:
\- its name is the name of the NRM class;
\- it derives by extension (see [3], [4] and [5]) the NrmClass XML complex
type defined in the XML schema genericNrm.xsd (see [11]);
\- it has the following XML attribute specifications, inherited from NrmClass
XML complex type:
\- an id XML attribute specification; this attribute specification carries the
attribute value part of the RDN of the NRM instance carried by the XML
element, i.e. the value of the naming attribute of this NRM instance;
\- an optional modifier XML attribute specification (see clause 4.4);
\- and its XML content is the succession of:
\- an optional attributes XML element whose XML content is the succession of:
\- zero or more specific XML elements (see below) corresponding to attributes
of the NRM class, each occurring not more than once;
\- zero or more similar specific XML elements corresponding to direct
subordinate NRM classes of the NRM class to which the current XML element
corresponds;
\- to each NRM attribute of each NRM class, except for the following NRM
attributes:
\- the naming NRM attribute of each NRM class, whose value is already carried
by the id XML attribute specification of the specific XML element
corresponding to the NRM class;
\- the conditional dnPrefix NRM attribute of SubNetwork, MeContext and
ManagedElement NRM classes (see [8]), whose value is already carried by the
dnPrefix XML attribute specification of the configData XML element;
corresponds a specific type of XML element having the following
characteristics:
\- its name is constructed from the name of the NRM attribute by removing any
contained dash character;
\- and it has an XML content; this XML content carries the value of the NRM
attribute.
For example for the SubNetwork NRM class (see [8]), the corresponding extract
of XML schema genericNrm.xsd (see [11]) is the following:
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
\\ \\
\\ \\
\\ \\
\\ \\ \\ \\ \
supported by the following extract of XML schema genericNrm.xsd (see [11]):
\\ \\ \\ [...]\
\\ \
Exceptions to the generic mapping rules for the definition of NRM-specific XML
element types are listed by the following table:

\
## 4.4 XML attribute specification modifier
As defined by the following extract of XML schema genericNrm.xsd (see [11]):
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
\\ \
the value of the optional modifier XML attribute specification of the specific
XML elements corresponding to the classes of the NRM is one of the following:
create, delete, or update.
The semantic carried by a modifier XML attribute specification applies only to
the NRM instance corresponding to the containing XML element and not to any
explicit or implicit subordinate NRM instances of this NRM instance.
The following rules apply for the modifier XML attribute specification:
\- in upload XML configuration files, no modifier XML attribute specification
should be present; on the contrary those are to be considered as meaningless
and shall be ignored;
\- in download XML configuration files:
\- if an XML element carrying an NRM instance has a modifier XML attribute
specification of value create, then all directly or indirectly contained XML
element carrying NRM instances, if any, shall also have a modifier XML
attribute specification of value create;
\- if an XML element carrying an NRM instance has a modifier XML attribute
specification of value delete, then all directly or indirectly contained XML
element carrying NRM instances, if any, shall also have a modifier XML
attribute specification of value delete;
\- if an XML element carrying an NRM instance has a modifier XML attribute
specification of value update, then all directly contained XML element
carrying NRM instances, if any, may also have a modifier XML attribute
specification, this one being of either value create, delete, or update;
\- if an XML element carrying an NRM instance has no modifier XML attribute
specification or a modifier XML attribute specification of value delete, then
it shall not directly contain an attributes XML element.
A tree of XML elements corresponding to a tree of NRM instances with all XML
elements having a modifier XML attribute specification of value create is
considered to be in accordance with the following rule from Bulk CM IRP IS
3GPP TS 32.612 [1]:
\"When part or a whole NRM subtree is to be created, in the configuration data
file the IRPManager shall first action the create action of parents MO
instances before actioning the create of any child MO instances contained in
the NRM subtree i.e. create actions on MO instances shall be specified in
recursive manner following the NRM hierarchy subtree from the highest MO
instances to the lowest MO instances the IRPManager requires to be created.\"
In such a tree of NRM instances, the XML element carrying a given NRM instance
does not accurately appear before XML elements carrying subordinate NRM
instances. The latter XML elements rather appear as the last part of the XML
content of the former XML element.
Nevertheless, XML parsing of such a tree of NRM instances can still enable the
above Bulk CM IRP IS rule to be fully respected. Example of an XML parsing
enabling such compliance is one effectively actioning the creation of each NRM
instance when having parsed the XML start-tag of the XML element carrying the
NRM instance and, if any, the contained attributes XML element.
A tree of XML elements corresponding to a tree of NRM instances with all XML
elements having a modifier XML attribute specification of value delete is
considered to be in accordance with the following rule from Bulk CM IRP IS
3GPP TS 32.612 [1]:
\"When part or whole NRM subtree is to be deleted, in the configuration data
file the IRPManager shall first action delete of all associated child
instances contained in the NRM subtree before actioning delete of MO parents
instances i.e. delete actions on MO instances shall be specified in a
recursive manner following the NRM hierarchy subtree from the lowest MO
instances to the highest MO instances the IRPManager requires to be deleted.\"
In such a tree of NRM instances, the XML elements carrying subordinate NRM
instances do not appear before the XML element carrying the parent NRM
instance. The former XML elements rather appear as the XML content of the
latter XML element.
Nevertheless, XML parsing of such a tree of NRM instances can still enable the
above Bulk CM IRP IS rule to be fully respected. Example of an XML parsing
enabling such compliance is one effectively actioning the delete of each NRM
instance when parsing the XML end-tag of the XML element carrying the NRM
instance.

files:

## 4.5 XML elements VsDataContainer, vsData and vsDataFormatVersion
As all XML element types corresponding to NRM classes (see clause 4.3A.2), the
VsDataContainer XML element type, explicitly declared in 3GPP TS 32.625 [11],
corresponds to the VsDataContainer NRM class defined in 3GPP TS 32.622 [8].
Contained in an attributes XML element type, itself contained in a
VsDataContainer XML element, as all XML element types corresponding to NRM
attributes (see clause 4.3A.2), the vsData and vsDataFormatVersion XML element
types, explicitly declared in 3GPP TS 32.625 [11], correspond to the vsData
and vsDataFormatVersion NRM attributes defined in 3GPP TS 32.622 [8].
As an exception to the generic mapping rules for the definition of NRM-
specific XML element types (see clause 4.3A.2), the vsData XML element type
has an empty XML content.
Each vendor-specific XML schema shall declare one ore more vendor-specific XML
element types that:
\- have a name starting with vsData, e.g. vsDataRHO;
\- derive by extension (see [3], [4] and [5]) the vsData XML element type
declared by the XML schema genericNrm.xsd (see [11]);
\- are designated as members of the substitution group (see [3], [4] and [5])
headed by the vsData XML element type.
Beyond the above statement, the definition of vendor-specific XML schemas is
outside the scope of this document.
The XML content of those vendor-specific XML elements carry vendor-specific
data.
The XML content of the vsDataFormatVersion XML element shall be the filename,
without the \".xsd\" file extension and without any path specification, of the
vendor-specific XML schema used for the related VsDataContainer XML element.
See Annex C for an example of a vendor-specific XML schema.
The following is an example of a vendor-specific XML element (in **bold**)
deriving and extending the vsData XML element in a configuration data XML
file:

# 5 Structure and content of session log XML files
The present clause defines the file format of session log XML files exchanged
between an IRPManager and an IRPAgent as part of getSessionLog operation of
the Bulk CM IRP IS (see [1]).
This file format is defined by the XML schema in Annex D and by the following
clauses.
The use of an XML schema enables to ensure session log XML files have the
proper structure and to some extent the proper content.
Location of the XML schemas used for session log XML files is outside the
scope of this document.
## 5.1 Global structure
The content of a session log XML file is the succession of:
\- the standard XML declaration with specification of the version of XML and
of the character encoding being used (see [2]);
> \- a bulkCmSessionLogFile XML element; this is the root XML element of
> session log XML files.
The definition of the allowed character encoding(s) is outside the scope of
this document.
As defined by the following extract of XML schema sessionLog.xsd (see Annex
D):
\\ \\ \\
\\ [...]\ \\ \\ [...]\ \\ \\ [...]\ \\ \\ \\
\
the XML content of a bulkCmSessionLogFile XML element is the succession of:
> \- a fileHeader XML element (see clause 5.2);
>
> \- one or several activity XML elements (see clause 5.3);

> \- a fileFooter XML element (see clause 5.2).
XML elements fileHeader and fileFooter are empty XML elements (see clause
5.2).
The bulkCmSessionLogFile XML element shall also have all the XML attribute
specifications that declare the XML namespaces (see [6]) used in the XML file.
Only the default XML namespace is used in session log XML files. It is
associated with the session log file XML schema sessionLog.xsd (see Annex D).
The following is an example of a session log XML file, without presentation of
the XML attribute specifications and XML content of fileHeader, activity and
fileFooter XML elements (replaced by [...]; see clauses 5.2 and 5.3):
\\ \\ \\ \\ [...]\ \\ \\ [...]\ \\ \\ \
## 5.2 XML elements fileHeader and fileFooter
The XML elements fileHeader and fileFooter for session log XML files have the
same definition, structure and content as the XML elements fileHeader and
fileFooter for configuration data XML files (see clause 4.2).
## 5.3 XML element activity
As defined by the following extract of XML schema sessionLog.xsd (see Annex
D):
\\
\\ \\ \\
[...]\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
\\ \\
\\ \\
\\ \\
\\ \\ \\ \\ \
an activity XML element:
\- has the following XML attribute specifications:
\- a dateTime XML attribute specification; this attribute specification
carries the date and time the Bulk CM activity was started;
\- a type XML attribute specification; this attribute specification carries
the type of the Bulk CM activity triggered by the IRPManager, upload,
download, validate, preactivate, activate or fallback;
\- and its XML content is the succession of one or several log XML elements.
As defined by the following extract of XML schema sessionLog.xsd (see Annex
D):
\\ \\
\\ \\ \\ \\
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\
\\ \\ \\ \\
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
\\ \\ \\ \
a log XML element:
\- has the following XML attribute specifications:
\- a time XML attribute specification; this attribute specification carries
the time the logged Bulk CM internal event occurred;
\- a type XML attribute specification; this attribute specification carries
the type of the logged Bulk CM internal event, being either informative or
error;
\- an optional dn XML attribute specification; this attribute specification
carries the DN of the NRM instance associated with the logged Bulk CM internal
event, if any;
\- an optional modifier XML attribute specification; this attribute
specification carries the value of the modifier (see clause 4.4) associated
with the NRM instance, if any;
\- and it has an XML content; this XML content carries the description of the
logged Bulk CM internal event.
The following is an example of an activity XML element (in **bold**) in a
session log XML file:

# 6 BulkCMIRP Notification XML Definitions
This clause provides XML definitions of Notification Log IRP notifications as
defined in [1].
The structure of the BulkCMIRP Notification XML Definitions is shown in
graphical depiction below:
{width="6.542361111111111in" height="2.09375in"}
{width="6.542361111111111in" height="2.09375in"}
The use of XML schema key word \"sequence\" to support IS-defined set (not
sequence) is for the purpose of XML processor efficiency. This shall not imply
the use of \"sequence\" in other technology.
