# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.391: Delta Synchronisation Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements
32.392: Delta Synchronisation Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information
Service (IS)
32.393: Delta Synchronisation Integration Reference Point (IRP); Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set
**32.395: Delta Synchronization Integration Reference Point (IRP); eXtensible
Markup Language (XML) file format definition**
The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of IRPs and a related Name
Convention, which realise the functional capabilities over this interface. The
basic structure of the IRPs is defined in TS 32.101 [1] and TS 32.102 [2].
IRPManagers (typically Network Management Systems) and IRPAgents (typically
EMs or NEs) synchronize their data concerning alarms or configuration data. In
certain scenarios this synchronization is lost or not done. This IRP provides
functionality to significantly reduce the amount of data which needs to be
transferred in order to re-establish synchronisation.
# 1 Scope
The purpose of Delta Synchronisation IRP is to define an interface through
which an IRPManager can request only those data which changed (i.e. changed,
were created or deleted) from a synchronisation point onwards.
The present document is the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file format
definition of Delta Synchronisation IRP for the IRP whose semantics is
specified in Delta Synchronisation IRP: Information Service (3GPP TS 32.392
[11]).
This XML Definitions specification defines the XML syntax of the Delta
Synchronisation IRP XML Data File.
This XML Definitions specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.392 V8.0.X.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Changed alarm** : See 3GPP TS 32.391 [10].
**Changed instance** : See 3GPP TS 32.391 [10].
**Delta Synchronisation** : See 3GPP TS 32.391 [10].
**Delta Synchronisation Point** : See 3GPP TS 32.391 [10].
**Full Synchronisation** : See 3GPP TS 32.391 [10].
**IRP:** See 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
**IRPAgent:** See 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
**IRPManager:** See 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
**XML file:** file containing an XML document
**XML document:** composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration
followed by a root XML element [4].
**XML declaration:** it specifies the version of XML being used, see [4].
**XML element:** has a type, is identified by a name, may have a set of XML
attribute specifications and is either composed of the succession of an XML
start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element followed by an XML
end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag; each XML element may
contain other XML elements, see [4].
**empty XML element:** having an empty XML content; an empty XML element still
possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an empty XML element is
either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag directly followed by an
XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag, see [4].
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag, see [4].
**XML start-tag:** the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute specifications
of the XML element, see [4].
**XML end-tag:** the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an XML end-
tag containing the name of the XML element, see [4].
**XML empty-element tag:** composed simply of an empty-element tag containing
the name and the set of XML attribute specifications of the XML element, see
[4].
**XML attribute specification:** has a name and a value, see [4].
**DTD:** defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML
document to be valid with regard to this DTD, see [4].
**XML schema:** more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema defines structure and
content constraints to be respected by an XML document to conform with this
XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML schemas can be used
together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself also an XML
document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas, see [5], [6]
and [7].
**XML namespace:** enables qualifying element and attribute names used in XML
documents by associating them with namespaces identified by different XML
schemas, see [5], [6] and [7].
**XML complex type:** defined in an XML schema; cannot be directly used in an
XML document; can be the concrete type or the derivation base type for an XML
element type or for another XML complex type; ultimately defines constraints
for an XML element on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML content,
see [5], [6] and [7].
**XML element type:** declared by an XML schema; can be directly used in an
XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element, directly or indirectly
defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML
content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base type for another
XML element type, see [5], [6] and [7].
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations apply:
EM Element Manager
IRP Integration Reference Point
IS Information Service (see 3GPP TS 32.101 [1])
Itf-N Interface N
NE Network Element
XML eXtensible Mark-up Language
# 4 Structure and content of configuration data XML files
Annex A of the present document defines the delta synchronization-specific XML
schema and element types in deltaSynchForCMData.xsd / deltaSynchForAlarms.xsd
which shall be used for the files of which the locations can be supplied as an
option in output of operation triggerDeltaSynchOfCMData or
triggerDeltaSynchOfAlarms defined in 3GPP TS 32.392 [11].
The present schema re-uses the structure and content of 3GPP TS 32.615 [14]
for delta synchronization for CM data and those of 3GPP TS 32.111-5 [13] for
delta synchronization for alarm data. The differences or additions are listed
here:
For delta synchronization for CM data:\ The modifier XML attribute
specification shall be used as follows:
  * Create for all created NRM instances
  * Update for all modified NRM instances
  * Delete for all deleted NRM instances
For delta synchronization for alarm data:
  * Created alarms shall be indicated by content XML elements of type=\"xa:NotifyNewAlarm"
  * Changed alarms shall be indicated by content XML elements of type=\"xa:NotifyChangedAlarm" or of type=\"xa:NotifyClearedAlarm" or of type=\"xa:NotifyComments"
  * Deleted alarms shall be indicated by content XML elements of type=\"xa:NotifyAckStateChanged"
## 4.1 Global structure
See 3GPP TS 32.615 [14]
The following XML namespaces are potentially used in delta synchronisation XML
files:
  * delta synchronisation for CM data files are associated with XML schema deltaSynchForCMData.xsd (see Annex A.1);
  * delta synchronisation for alarm data files are associated with XML schema deltaSynchForAlarmData.xsd (see Annex A.2);
