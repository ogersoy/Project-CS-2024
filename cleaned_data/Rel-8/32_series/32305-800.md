# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.301: Configuration Management (CM); Notification Integration Reference
Point (IRP): Requirements
32.302: Configuration Management (CM); Notification Integration Reference
Point (IRP): Information Service (IS)
32.303: Configuration Management (CM); Notification Integration Reference
Point (IRP): Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set
(SS)
**32.305: Configuration Management (CM); Notification Integration Reference
Point (IRP): eXtensible Markup Language (XML) definition**
32.307: Configuration Management (CM); Notification Integration Reference
Point (IRP): Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Solution Set (SS)
The present document is part of a TS-family, which describes the requirements
and information model necessary for Telecommunications Management (TM). The TM
principles and TM architecture are specified in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1] and 3GPP TS
32.102 [2].
A standard general-purpose mechanism for the management of logs containing
selected notifications from the network is required to provide an ability to
perform historical analysis on faults and conditions, which occurred in the
network. The TS 32.33x-series, constituting the Notification Log IRP, sets
forth such a mechanism - and the present document contains the XML definition
related to Notification IRP notification header.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the XML Definitions for the Notification
Integration Reference Point (Notification IRP) as it applies to Itf-N, in
accordance with Notification IRP IS definitions [3].
This XML Definitions specification defines the Notification IRP XML
Notification header format.
This specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.302.
# 2 References

text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.

# 4 Notification IRP XML Definitions
## 4.1 Notification IRP XML notification header Definitions
This clause provides XML definitions of Notification IRP notification header
as defined in 3GPP TS 32.302 [3].\ These definitions are to be used in
conjunction with Notification Log IRP XML Definitions for Notification Log IRP
XML Data File and the NL IRP XML Notification Format (3GPP TS 32.335 [4]).
The structure of the Notification IRP XML Notification header Format is shown
in figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1: Structure of the Notification IRP XML Notification header Format
The Notification IRP XML Notification header Format uses the definition of
notifications in Annex A.
