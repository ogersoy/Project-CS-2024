# Introduction
3GPP SA5 has agreed to accept Self-Organizing Networks (SON) in studying
LTE&SAE OAM architecture, and\ 3GPP RAN has agreed to study UMTS home NodeB
and LTE home NodeB.
For SON it is expected that UE, NodeB, OAM system - both Element Management
System (EMS) and Network Management System (NMS) in LTE/UMTS system - are
involved in supporting SON as follows:
1) Home NodeB specific aspect of Interface between NMS and EMS
2) Home NodeB specific aspect of Interface between 2 EMSs
3) Home NodeB specific aspect of Interface between EMS and Home NodeB
4) Interface between 2 Home NodeBs, or between one Home NodeB and one Macro
eNodeB (depending on output of RAN3 study)
For both LTE and UMTS home NodeB, SON is expected to be necessary because:
1) Number of home NodeB can be very big.
2) Subscriber may switch on and off home NodeB frequently.
3) Operator may not be able to access home NodeB physically as it is located
in subscriber's place.
# 1 Scope
The present document intends to study the following:
1) Define SON OAM solution architecture for both LTE and UMTS home NodeB.
2) Identify differences between SON OAM solution architecture for LTE Marco
eNodeB and that for LTE and UMTS home NodeB; Propose aligned SON OAM solution
architecture.
3) Identify what can be standardized for SON for LTE and UMTS NodeB in 3GPP
SA5.
4) Prepare the work for a later implementation work item.

## 5.1 Management Reference Model for HNB
Editor's Notes:
1.The interface type 2 and type 1 which are defined in TS32.101 are to be
standardized for the management of Home NodeB and Home eNodeB.
2.Management Reference model in TS.32.101 figure 1 needs no change.
3.Type 2: is IRP based; investigate what enhancements (to current set of IRP
specifications) are needed for management of Home NodeB and Home eNodeB.
4.Type 1: investigate what protocol is appropriate for Home NodeB and Home
eNodeB.
5.TR32.821 shall address type 1 requirements and type 2 requirements
separately.
## 5.2 HNB System Overview
3G HNBs are consumer products which provide 3G Services in the home utilising
the internet connection, provided by the Consumer's Broadband Device, to
connect to the Mobile Operator's Core Network HNB Gateways. The Mobile
Operator's Business model may also include the broadband service offering and
therefore support for a consolidated Management Platform needs to be taken
into account by 3GPP SA5 for HNB-GW Discovery Procedures.
3GPP SA1 requirements contained within 3GPP TS 22.220 v0.3.0 [12] state that
the OAM procedures shall be as closely aligned as possible with those that are
commonly used in broadband access networks as defined in [8] which is the
TR-069 CPE WAN Management Protocol.
The present document defines a TR-069 based OAM interface for Configuration
Management, Performance Management, and Fault Management.
Figure 1: HNB/HNB-GW architecture with O&M interfaces
Figure 1 is the Home Node B equivalent to Figure 9 in the 3GPP specification
TS 25.401 [11] and depicts both an integrated HNB on the left side and
standalone HNB with a co-located Broadband Service on the right hand side.
The logical OAM is the signalling associated with the control of logical
resources owned by the Management Platform but physically implemented in the
HNB and notified to the HNB-GW. This contribution suggests that the messages
needed in the information exchange between the Management Platform and the HNB
are an integral part of TR-069 as defined by the Broadband Forum [8]. The
subsequent messages needed in the information exchange between the HNB and the
HNB-GW is an integral part of HNBAP as defined by 3GPP RAN3.
Implementation Specific OAM functions are heavily dependent on the
implementation of the HNB, both for its hardware components and for the
management of the software components. This contribution suggests that the
messages needed in the information exchange are an integral part of TR-069 as
defined by the Broadband Forum [8].
There are two equivalent, alternative paths for communications between the HNB
and the Management Platform for O&M purposes. These are:
> 1\. The TR-069 management path is between the HNB and the Management
> Platform via a secure IPSec tunnel that terminates at the Security Gateway
> element of the HNB-GW. Management traffic is then routed from the private
> side of the Security Gateway through the operator's IP network to reach the
> Management Platform. The TR-069 management traffic may share the same IPSec
> SA as the HNB bearer and control traffic, or may optionally use a discrete
> IPSec SA in the same, or a different IPSec tunnel instance pending 3GPP Iuh
> standardisation, as per Figure 2.
>
> 2\. The TR-069 management path is directly between the HNB and the
> Management Platform via a routed IP path that does not traverse any element
> through the HNB-GW, including the Security Gateway. The management path is
> therefore independent of the HNB-GW's security method, geographic location
> and availability, as per Figure 1.
In both cases, TR-069 O&M and HNB bearer/control traffic share the same
physical interface at the HNB into the broadband IP network.
Figure 2: HNB/HNB-GW architecture with O&M interfaces via IPSEC Tunnel
The TR-069 Management connection between the Serving HMS and 3G HNB is not
persistent and therefore to establish a Management Connection requires the
Serving HMS to send an HTTP Connection Request to the 3G HNB, as shown in
Figure 2.
The HTTP Connection request sent from the Serving HMS to the 3G HNB shall
follow one of the following options:
> a. if the IPSEC tunnel's end point IP-Address allocated to the 3G HNB is
> uniquely allocated across all Security Gateways within the network then the
> HTTP Connection Request can be sent to the Security Gateway to be forwarded
> to the 3G HNB
>
> b. if the IPSEC tunnel's end point IP-Address allocated to the 3G HNB is not
> uniquely allocated across all Security Gateways within the network or is
> uniquely allocated but the HTTP Connection request is restricted from being
> sent down the IPSEC Tunnel directly due to the Security Policy then the HTTP
> Connection Request can be sent to the Serving HNB-GW to be sent to the 3G
> HNB via HNBAP
The challenges from a deployment perspective are with FAP Initialisation and
FGW Discovery which are as follows:
> a. Network Operator's with a consolidated Broadband and FAP offering may
> require to combine the TR-069 ACS Platforms in their network which requires
> secure communication to the ACS Servers prior to IPSec Tunnel establishment
>
> b. TR-069 CPE devices are currently factory programmed with a Bootstrap ACS
> URL only and therefore FAP capable CPEs either require to be factory
> programmed with Bootstrap Security Gateway/IPSec Information or this
> information is supplied outside of the IPSec tunnel before tunnel
> establishment
>
> The HNBAP interaction between the HNB-GW and the HNB is recognised as 3GPP
> RAN3 defined and is out of scope of this document.
## 5.3 HNB System Interface and Reference Points
Figure 3 shows the Management Reference Model and Interfaces for the 3GPP HNB
System's Radio Network Layer.
Figure 3: 3GPP HNB Radio Network Management Interfaces
Figure 3 identifies the following Management Interfaces:
a. Itf-HNB - between Home NodeB & its Manager (physically, this may be a
direct connection or via the Security Gateway on the Home NodeB Gateway) (type
1).
b. Itf-HNBGW - between Home NodeB Gateway & its Manager, this could align with
and be a subset of the Itf-R interface already specified for RNC. This isn't
in the scope of this document and would be for further study (type 1).
c. Itf-N -- between the Network (Element Manager or NEs with an embedded EM) &
Network Manager (type 2).
The reference model shown in Figure 4 contains the typically essential network
elements that make up the femto network.
Figure 4: Iuh reference model
The HNB GW serves the purpose of a RNC presenting itself to the CN as a
concentrator of HNB connections. In the reference architecture, the term
Initial for certain elements refer to Initial Point of Contact and distinguish
them from the serving elements. The Iu interface between the CN and the HNB GW
serves the same purpose as the interface between the CN and a RNC.
The Initial SeGway, Initial HMS, and Initial HNB-GW are optional elements and
the role of these elements may well be served by the SeGway, Serving HMS and
the serving HNB-GW.
Figure 5: TR069 based provisioning
The interface to the provisioning and management elements is via the TR-069
family of standards and in Figure 5 above, TR-069 CWMP session tunnelled
through IPSec (solid blue line) is the preferred option where as TR-069 CWMP
session with SSL (dotted blue line) is the fall back option if IPSec
tunnelling is not possible for HMS connectivity.
### 5.3.1 Functional elements
The following functional entities serve various roles in the bootstrapping,
initial provisioning, ongoing management and operation of the HNB network:
#### 5.3.1.1 Initial HNB Management System (HMS)
  * Based on TR-069 CWMP
  * Initial provisioning of HNB
  * Determines "Tentative Location" (unverified), which can be used to > find the serving HMS, SeGway, and HNB-GW
  * This entity is optional; if not present, the role of the Initial HMS > will be fulfilled by the Serving HMS.
#### 5.3.1.2 Initial Security Gateway (SeGway)
  * IPsec security gateway
  * IKEv2 authentication of HNB
  * Provides access to Initial HMS (optionally) and initial HNB-GW
  * This entity is optional; if it is not included, the role of the Initial SeGway will be fulfilled by the "serving" SeGway.
#### 5.3.1.3 Initial HNB Gateway (HNB-GW)
  * Terminates Iuh from HNB
  * Determines whether there is a need to redirect the Iuh interface to another HNB-GW
  * This entity is optional; if it is not included, the role of the Initial HNB-GW will be fulfilled by the Serving HNB
#### 5.3.1.4 Serving HNB Management System (HMS)
  * Based on TR-069 CWMP
  * Determines the Certified Location of the HNB (potentially based on Radio Environment Measurements (REMs)
  * Provides final provisioning of HNB and ongoing management functions (e.g., measurement and event reporting)
  * Directs HNB to Serving HNB-GW
  * The Serving HMS may also satisfy the functional requirements of the Initial HMS.
#### 5.3.1.5 Serving Security Gateway (SeGway)
  * IPsec security gateway
  * IKEv2 authentication of HNB
  * Provides access to Serving HMS and Serving HNB-GW
  * The Serving SeGway may also satisfy the functional requirements of the Initial SeGway.
#### 5.3.1.6 Serving HNB Gateway (HNB-GW)
  * Terminates Iuh from HNB
  * Provides service to the HNB
  * May redirect the Iuh interface to better serving HNB-GW
  * The Serving HNB-GW may also satisfy the functional requirements of the initial HNB-GW.
### 5.3.2 Itf-HNB Interface
The Itf-HNB Interface shall use the TR-069 CWMP for Configuration Management,
Performance Management, and Fault Management.
TR-069 CWMP permits Configuration Management interaction from the HMS to the
HNB via either RPC Method calls or an XML File Format.
For HNB-GW discovery, initial provisioning, and on-going configuration
management of the HNB, the HMS shall support the two methods as defined in
TR-069 CWMP for provisioning and configuration management which are as
follows:
> 1.The HMS uses TR-069 RPC Methods, such as AddObject, SetParameterValues,
> and SetParameterAttributes, to directly provision the HNB Data Model
> parameter values.
>
> 2.The HMS uses TR-069 Download RPC Methods to request the HNB to download a
> configuration file to provision the HNB Data Model parmater values. The HMS
> provides the location of the file to be transferred by providing a URL to
> the 3G HNB.
A standard configuration file format has not been defined for the HNB.
Consequently, the configuration file shall be considered vendor-specific until
a 3GPP Configuration Management XML File Format is defined. The configuration
file may be generated by a provisioning system at the time the HNB service was
ordered or on-demand when a provisioning request is received by the HMS from n
upstream provisioning system. The configuration file may be hosted on a
separate HMS File Server or hosted on the HMS and Figure 7 shows the
functional entities.
The call flows in the later sections of the document only show the use of RPC
Methods which is for ease of readability and to transfer the call flows to an
XML File Format based approach please replace the TR-069 RPC Method based
Configuration Flow in Figure 6 with the TR-069 XML File Based Configuration
Flow in Figure 7:

##### 6.2.1.2.5 HNB-GW Discovery Method
The HNB on connection to the Mobile Operator's Network through the Internet
needs to establish a connection to a HNB-GW in-order to provide 3G Services to
the consumer. The Serving HMS in the network provides the HNB with the Serving
HNB-GW information as well as the Service Information required to establish
and provide 3G Services.
The HNB is factory programmed with default TR-069 based Management Platform
information (HMS URL/IP-Address) and optionally with default IPSec/SEC-GW
information to allow the establishment of a Secure Tunnel if this is a pre-
requisite to gain access to the Management Platform for Configuration
information.
HNB-GW Discovery Procedure below assumes that the Factory Set HMS on the 3G
HNB isn't the same as the HMS operationally serving the 3G HNB in the network:
Figure 9: HNB-GW Discovery Procedure
1.The 3G HNB obtains connectivity to the Internet as a result of the Broadband
Device Connectivity Procedure
> 2.If Factory Set IPSec/SeGW information isn't available on the 3G HNB then
> an IPSEC Tunnel is not required for HMS connection and the following occurs:
>
> a.3G HNB requests DNS (Domain Name Server) for the address of the Factory
> Set Initial HMS's URL, using the public DNS server.
>
> b.DNS responds with the IP-Addresses of the Initial HMS.
>
> 3.If Factory Set IPSec/SeGW information is available on the 3G HNB then an

>
> 9.The 3G HNB releases the TR-069 CWMP Session and if the SSL connection was

As mentioned above, this document introduces a TR-069 mechanism to support the
discovery of the HNB-GW and supply of the Service Information from the Home
Management System to the 3G HNB to establish 3G Services.
##### 6.2.1.2.6 HNB Registration Method
Once the HNB has discovered the Serving HNB-GW and Serving IPSec/SeGW from the
HMS it establishes a connection to a HNB-GW in-order to provide 3G Services to
the consumer.
The HNB-GW Information provided to the 3G HNB can be a dedicated HNB-GW for
the 3G HNB or through various techniques such as load-balancing and service
availability the HNB-GW address can be used to register the 3G HNB on one of
many HNB-GWs within a pre-defined pool of HNB-GWs.
HNB Registration Procedure below:
Figure 10: HNB Registration Procedure
> 1.The 3G HNB obtains the Serving HNB-GW, Serving IPSec/SeGW, and 3G HNB
> Service Information as a result of the HNB-GW Discovery Procedure
>
> 2.If a Secure Tunnel isn't already established to the SeGW the 3G HNB
> establishes a Secure Tunnel between the 3G HNB and SeGW and the following
> occurs:
>
> a.3G HNB requests DNS (Domain Name Server) for the address of the Serving
> SeGway, using the public DNS server.
>
> b.DNS responds with the IP-Addresses of the Serving Segway.
>
> c.Secure IPSEC Tunnel is established between the 3G HNB and SeGway.
>
> 3.3G HNB requests DNS (Domain Name Server) for the address of the Serving
> HNB-GW, using the DNS server IP address provided along with IPSec tunnel.
4.DNS responses with the IP-Addresses of the Serving HNB-GW.
5.An SCTP Session is established between the 3G HNB and the HNB-GW.
> 6.The 3G HNB sends an HNBAP Register Request to the HNB-GW containing
> registration information such as 3G HNB Identifier, LAC, Parameter
> Authentication Code, Initial Registration Flag, HNB-Internet-Address, and
> optionally location information , RAC, SAC, UE Information List, and HNB
> Virtual IP-Address.\ The HNB-GW determines if the 3G HNB can be serviced by
> itself or should be re-homed to another HNB-GW within the same pool using
> the 3G HNB supplied information as a determining criteria along with the
> load on the HNB-GW.
>
> 7.In the case that the HNB-GW can service the 3G HNB the HNB-GW sends an
> HNBAP Registration Response with Registration Accept.
>
> 8.In the case that the HNB-GW can not service the 3G HNB and can not offer
> re-homing to another HNB-GW the HNB-GW sends an HNBAP Registration Reject
> with a Reject Cause Code.
>
> 9.In the case that the HNB-GW can not service the 3G HNB but can offer re-
> homing to another HNB-GW the HNB-GW sends an HNBAP Registration Response
> with a Redirect Cause Code and Redirect Parameters which optionally includes
> the new Serving HNB-GW URL/IP-Address. If a new HNB-GW Address is included
> then the HNB shall maintain the same Segway and HNB-GW Provisioning Data but
> if the HNB-GW Address is not included then the HNB shall retrieve another
> HNB-GW from the list of HNB-GWs supplied by the Serving HMS.
10.In the event of a Registration Reject or Registration response with
redirect the SCTP connection is released.
> 11.In the event of either a Registration Reject or a Registration Response
> with a Redirect Cause Code with no new HNB-GW Address provided then the
> existing Secure Tunnel is also released.
As mentioned above, this document introduces the supply of the Service
Information to the HNB-GW from the 3G HNB.
##### 6.2.1.2.7 HNB Configuration Update Method
Once the HNB has registered on the Serving HNB-GW the 3G Services will be
provided to the consumer and will only be affected if the Mobile Operator
updates the configuration of the 3G HNB on the HMS which impacts the 3G HNB
operational state of the 3G Services provided.
To update the 3G HNB of service changes the HMS establishes a connection with
the 3G HNB using TR-069 and then the 3G HNB subsequently passes up any HNB-GW
relevant changes via HNBAP using an additional HNBAP Message HNB Configuration
Update. This is equivalent functionality to S1-AP: ENB Configuration Update
Procedure contained within the 3GPP TS 36.300 Title "E-UTRA and E-UTRAN
Overall Description Stage 2" document [10].
HNB Configuration Update Procedure below:
Figure11: HNB Configuration Update Procedure
1.The 3G HNB is registered on the Serving HNB-GW as a result of the HNB
Registration Procedure
> 2.If the Connection Request URL Parameter stored against the 3G HNB in the
> Serving HMS is a URL rather than an IP-Address the following occurs:
>
> a.3G HNB requests DNS (Domain Name Server) for the address of the 3G HNB
> Connection Request URL.
>
> b.DNS responds with the IP-Addresses of the 3G HNB Connection Request URL.
3.If the Network uniquely assigns an IPSEC Address to each 3G HNB within the
Network then the following occurs:
> a.A TCP Session is opened between the HMS and the 3G HNB to carry the
> following TR-069 HTTP transactions, and this connection will be carried
> within the IPSec tunnel.
>
> b.HMS sends an HTTP Connection Request to the 3G HNB using HTTP Digest
> Access Authentication as specified by TR-069 [3].\ The 3G HNB determines the
> validity of the Connection Request from the HMS using a combination of the
> username/password and HTTP Digest Access Authentication for transport
> security of the password as defined in TR-069 [3].
>
> c.In the case that the Connection Request from the HMS is valid the 3G HNB
> sends a Connection Response with Status Code "200 OK" indicating that the 3G
> HNB will establish a connection to the HMS.\ In the case that the Connection
> Request from the HMS is invalid the 3G HNB sends a Connection Response with
> a Status Code other than "200 OK" indicating that the 3G HNB will not
> establish a connection to the HMS.
>
> d.The TCP Session is closed
>
> 4.If the Network doesn't uniquely assign an IPSEC Address to each 3G HNB

>
> e.In the case that the HNBAP Connect Response Cause Code from the 3G HNB is

As mentioned above, this document introduces a TR-069 mechanism to support the
updating of the Service Information directly to the 3G HNB which then supplies
the Service Information to the HNB-GW via the 3G HNB.
#### 6.2.1.2 Performance Management
##### 6.2.1.2.1 General Requirements
The Home NodeB shall support Performance Management to enable the operator to
monitor the HNB Network.
The requirements for performance management are as follows
> 1.Performance Information shall be generated by the HNB if activated and the
> Broadband-Forum's PD-157 and WT-135 specifications shall be used as a basis
> for the HNB Data Model which shall be administered through the Broadband-
> Forum's TR-069 Messaging Protocol
>
> 2.The HNB shall have the Performance capabilities administered through the
> TR-069 HMS Server and shall allow the direct upload of Performance Files
> from the HNB to the designated Performance Server.
Figure 12: HNB/HNB-GW Performance Management
> HNB OAM Traffic can be transferred through the HNB-GW but the O&M traffic
> exchanged over this signalling link is completely transparent to the
> Security Gateway on the HNB-GW.

>
> c.HTTP PUT with Username/Password
>
> d.FTP with Username/Password
>
> 8.The EMS shall have the capability to completely clear performance elements
> from the HNB Performance Table via TR-069 RPC Method Calls
##### 6.2.1.2.2 Performance Management method
The Home NodeB should support Performance Management so that the operator can
evaluate the performance of a mobile network with Home NodeBs. Since the
number of Home NodeBs in a mobile network can be very large, Home NodeB sends
performance data only on demand of DM in order to avoid congestion of the DM
by performance data transmission.
For each Home NodeB, the detailed requirements for performance data passive
collection are as follows:
> 1\. Whether there is OAM connection or not, the Home NodeB always generates
> measurement data due to its policy.
>
> 2\. The Operator's Home NodeB measurement policy should be set in the DM.
>
> 3\. The Home NodeB should report measurement data on demand of DM.
Editor\'s Note: "on demand of DM" doesn't mean Home NodeB has permanent
connection with DM.
##### 6.2.1.2.3 Performance Data (KPI & counter)
For each Home NodeB, DM shall be able to collect performance data to enable to
evaluate Home NodeB performance.
Editor\'s Note: Concrete KPIs & counters are FFS
#### 6.2.1.3 Fault Management
##### 6.2.1.3.1 General Requirements
The Home NodeB shall support Fault Management to enable the operator to
maintain his mobile network with Home NodeBs with high availability and good
quality of service.
The Home NodeBs shall constantly perform error detection and the requirements
for fault management are as follows:
> 1.Events shall be generated to indicate one of the following specific events
> has occurred:
>
> a.alarm event indicating a fault condition on the HNB
>
> b.other event indicating that a non-fault condition has occurred on the HNB
> e.g. HNB activated for service.
>
> 2.The HNB shall have the capability to indirectly send Event Messages to the
> EMS directly for event reporting by connecting via the HMS Provisioning
> Server.

> HNB OAM Traffic can be transferred through the HNB-GW but the O&M traffic
> exchanged over this signalling link is completely transparent to the
> Security Gateway on the HNB-GW.
>
> 3.The HNB shall support an Itf-HNB interface to the HMS based on the CWMP
> Specification as defined in _Broadband Forum TR-069 Amendment 2_ and the 3G
> Fault Management Requirements as defined in 3GPP TS.32.111-1.
>
> 4.The TR-069 Event Objects to be sent to the EMS by the HNB shall support
> the inclusion of the appropriate Information attributes for ease of
> integration to the upstream Itf interface, as defined in 3GPP TS.32.111-2.
>
> 5.The HNB shall maintain the following information:
>
> a.Event Management Information which contains the event management and
> reporting parameters configurable by the EMS
>
> b.Active Events List -- Events with a defined lifecycle (Raised, Modified,
> Cleared)
>
> c.History of Events which would contain multiple notifications for a single
> event due to the lifecycle state changes of the event.
>
> d.Event Queue -- events queued to be sent to the EMS from the HNB on
> connection to the EMS
>
> 6.The HNB shall issue events to the EMS based on the configuration of the
> specific event's reporting mechanism parameter
>
> a.Active -- the HNB connects to the EMS immediately to raise the event and
> logs the event in the Event History.\ If the event is configured with a
> lifecycle setting then the HNB updates the Active Events List.
>
> b.Queue -- the HNB queues the event internally pending connection to the
> EMS, logs the event in the Event History, and eventually delivers the event
> to the EMS as a result of one of the following:
>
> i.periodic connection
>
> ii.connection to the EMS due to another reason
>
> If the event is configured with a lifecycle setting then the HNB updates the
> Active Events List.
>
> c.Log -- the HNB stores the event in the Event History and can only be

> requesting the uploading of an Event History File to the EMS.
>
> If the event is configured with a lifecycle setting then the HNB updates the

>
> d.Disabled -- the HNB discards the event completely.
>
> 7.The HNB shall handle an event not configured in the HNB with Event
> Configuration Information with the same functionality used to handle a

>
> 8.The EMS shall have the ability to throttle the sending of events from the
> HNB to the EMS by the following:

>
> (3)BlockSending - The HNB handles events in HNB-EMR-6 above with the
> exception that alarms aren't sent to the EMS and will remain in the HNB

>
> (4)Disabled - The HNB handles events as described in HNB-EMR-6 above with

##### 6.2.1.3.2 Alarm Reporting
The number of Home NodeBs controlled by the OAM of one operator is expected to
be very large, which presents challenges with respect to the scalability of
the OAM traffic. At the same time, the number of users affected by the failure
of one Home NodeB will be relatively small. Therefore, the Home NodeB should
provide alarm information (including notifications and logs) only on demand
from the OAM.
##### 6.2.1.3.3 Faulty Conditions
OAM is not expected to collect alarms from Home NodeBs continuously;
therefore, a Home NodeB that detects a faulty condition from which it cannot
immediately recover by its own means should eliminate any risk of negatively
affecting the performance of surrounding Macro NodeBs and Home NodeBs. To
ensure this:
\- The Home NodeB should stop radio transmission in case of faulty conditions
negatively affecting the surrounding radio network;
Editor\'s Note: The list of these faulty conditions is FFS.
The Home NodeB should stop radio transmission in case the backhaul link is
lost.

The IRPAgent shall be able to make the necessary configuration changes in its
managed Home NodeBs, using the configuration data contained in the transferred
configuration file.
The file format shall be independent of the data transfer protocol used to
carry the file from one system to another.
#### 6.2.2.3 Performance Management
##### 6.2.2.3.1 Performance Management method
> 1\. The DM for Home NodeB should support PMIRP over Itf-N
#### 6.2.2.4 Fault Management
##### 6.2.2.4.1 Alarm Reporting
The DM for Home NodeB should support AlarmIRP over Itf-N for managed Home
NodeBs.
#### 6.2.2.5 Subscriber Management
Home NodeB may have a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) access permission list.
Only those subscribers who are in the CSG access permission list can camp on
the Home NodeB.
For each Home NodeB, the detailed requirements for subscriber management are
as follows:
  1. IRPManager shall be able to provision the CSG access permission list of the Home NodeB.
  2. IRPManager shall be able to get the current CSG access permission list of the Home NodeB from IRPAgent.
  3. The CSG access permission list should be managed in a secure way.
