The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor 3G-system.
During the lifetime of a 3G network, its logical and physical configuration
will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise
the utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed
through network configuration management activities and/or network
engineering, see TS 32.600 [3].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a 3G network require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document is to describe the mechanisms
involved in the collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
Annex B of 32.404 helps in the definition of new performance measurements that
can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and inclusion in the present
document. Annex B of 32.404 discusses a top-down performance measurement
definition methodology that focuses on how the end-user of performance
measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for UMTS and combined
UMTS/GSM.
TS 32.401 [1] describes Performance Management concepts and requirements.
The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of a UMTS network and combined UMTS/GSM network.
Only measurement types that are specific to UMTS or combined UMTS/GSM networks
are defined within the present documents. Vendor specific measurement types
used in UMTS and combined UMTS/GSM networks are not covered. Instead, these
could be applied according to manufacturer\'s documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) shall only be
referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need identified for
the existence of such a reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. RNC related measurements);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. soft handover measurements);
\- Header 3: Measurements.

# 4 Measurements related to the MMS Relay/Server
Figure 4.1
MM1: Reference point MM1 is used to submit Multimedia Messages from MMS User
Agent to MMS Relay/Server, to let the MMS User Agent pull MMs from the MMS
Relay/Server, let the MMS Relay/Server push information about MMs to the MMS
User Agent as part of an MM notification, and to exchange delivery reports
between MMS Relay/Server and MMS User Agents.
MM2: Not specified yet
MM3: Reference point MM3 is used by the MMS Relay/Server to send Multimedia
Messages to and retrieve MMs from servers of external (legacy) messaging
systems that are connected to the service provider\'s MMS Relay/Server.
MM4: Reference point MM4 between MMS Relay/Servers belonging to different
MMSEs is used to transfer messages between them.
MM5: Reference point MM5 may be used to provide information to the MMS
Relay/Server about the subscriber.
MM6: Not specified
MM7: Reference point MM7 is used to transfer MMs from MMS Relay/Server to MMS
VAS applications and to transfer MMs from MMS VAS applications to MMS
Relay/Server.
MMS uses a number of technologies to realise the requirements of the stage 1
description (TS 22.140) [2]. As far as possible existing protocols (e.g. WAP,
SMTP, ESMTP as transfer protocols; lower layers to provide push, pull,
notification) and existing message formats (e.g. SMIL, MIME) shall be used for
the realisation of the Multimedia Messaging Service.
In order to define generic measurements, 3GPP should specify Performance
measurements based on the Reference Points (MM1 to MM7) and not specific to
the protocol implemented. So whatever the implementation IP or WAP for
example, the Reference Point messages are generic and so the measurements will
be the same.
The main interfaces involve in the MMS delivery are the interface MM1 and MM4,
we can see in this diagram the exact messages involve in the delivery. Those
messages can be used to define Performance Measurement on a MMS Relay/Server
basis.
Figure 4.2: Example Abstract Message Flow
The most important quality metrics for MMS are availability, accuracy and
speed. This contribution addresses the first two, the speed will require
additional measurements based on time to deliver the multimedia messages.
Availability and accuracy are a measure of the percentage of request that are
successfully served and how complete the response is. The mentioned triggering
points enable to define raw number of messages sent and received by the MMS
Relay/Server, but is not good enough to gather service quality measurement,
because those are only volume measurements. Also Response messages provide an
acknowledgement mechanism for the request messages and those response messages
can be positive or negative acknowledgement. This information is in the
\"Request Status code\" which is contained by the \"Request Status\" field in
the response messages. So in order to gather service quality measurements, a
higher granularity is required for the response messages measurements:
subcounters per request status code are introduced for that purpose. This is
for MM1 submission and retrieval as well as every MM4 response messages
measurements.
Background Information on the Request Status from TS 23.140 [2]
**Request Status:** The originator MMS Relay/Server shall indicate the status
of the MM1_submit.REQ in the associated MM1_submit.RES. The reason code given
in the status information element of the MM1_submit.RES may be supported with
an explanatory text further qualifying the status. If this text is available
in the Request status text information element the MMS User Agent should bring
it to the user\'s attention. The choice of the language used in the Request
status text information element is at the discretion of the MMS service
provider.
Table 4.1: Information elements in the MM1_submit.RES
* * *
Information element Presence Description Message Type Mandatory Identifies
this message as MM1_submit.RES. Transaction ID Mandatory The identification of
the MM1_submit.REQ/MM1_submit.RES pair. MMS Version Mandatory Identifies the
version of the interface supported by the MMS Relay/Server. Request Status
Mandatory The status of the MM submit request. Request Status Text Optional
Description which qualifies the status of the MM submit request. Message ID
Conditional The identification of the MM if it is accepted by the originator
MMS Relay/Server. Store Status Conditional If the Store request was present in
MM1_submit.REQ, the status of the store request. Store Status Text Optional
The explanatory text corresponding to the Store Status, if present. Stored
Message Reference Conditional If the Store request was present in
MM1_submit.REQ, the message reference to the newly stored MM.

Request-Status-Code Meaning Ok The corresponding request and some or all of
its contents were accepted without errors. Error-unspecified An unspecified
error occurred during the processing or reception of the corresponding
request. Error-service-denied The corresponding request was rejected due to
failure of authentication or authorisation of the originating MMS
Relay/Server. Error-message-format-corrupt An inconsistency with the message
format was detected when the corresponding request was parsed. Error-sending-
address-unresolved There were no MMS address (From:, To:, Cc:, Bcc:) in its
proper format or none of the addresses belong to the recipient MMS
Relay/Server. Error-message-not-found This status code is obsolete Error-
network-problem The recipient MMS Relay/Server was not able to accept the
corresponding request due to capacity overload. Error-content-not-accepted The
MM content was not accepted due to size, media type, copyrights or some other
reason. Error-unsupported-message The recipient MMS Relay/Server does not
support the corresponding request abstract message.
