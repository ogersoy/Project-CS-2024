# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.751: **\"Evolved Packet Core (EPC)** Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP): Requirements\";
**32.752: \"Evolved Packet Core (EPC) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP): Information Service (IS)\";**
32.753: \"**Evolved Packet Core (EPC)** Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP): Common Object Request Broker Architecture
(CORBA) Solution Set (SS)\";
32.755: \"**Evolved Packet Core (EPC)** Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP): Bulk CM eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
file format definition\".
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimization programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the protocol neutral EPC Network Resource Model
IRP Information Service, through which an \'IRPAgent\' (typically an Element
Manager or Network Element) can communicate information to one or several
\'IRPManagers\' (typically Network Managers) concerning EPC resources. It
reuses relevant parts of the Generic NRM in 3GPP TS 32.622 [6], either by
direct reuse or sub-classing, and in addition to that defines EPC specific
Information Object Classes.
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface IRP such
as the \"Basic CM IRP\" is needed (3GPP TS 32.602 [7]). However, which
Interface IRP is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2], 3GPP TS 32.600 [5] and the following
apply:
**Association:** In general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects.\ Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
(1) name bindings;
(2) reference attributes; and
(3) association objects.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams).
**Managed Element (ME):** an instance of the Information Object Class
ManagedElement defined in 3GPP TS 32.622 [6].
**Managed Object (MO):** in the context of the present document, a Managed
Object (MO) is a software object that encapsulates the manageable
characteristics and behaviour of a particular Network Resource.\ The MO is
instance of a MO class defined in a MIM/NRM. This class, called **Information
Object Class (IOC)** has _attributes_ that provide information used to
characterize the objects that belong to the class (the term \"attribute\" is
taken from TMN and corresponds to a \"property\" according to CIM).
Furthermore, the IOC can have _operations_ that represent the behaviour
relevant for that class (the term \"operation\" is taken from TMN and
corresponds to a \"method\" according to CIM). The IOC may support the
emission of _notifications_ that provide information about an event occurrence
within a network resource.
**Management Information Model (MIM):** also referred to as NRM - see the
definition below.
**Network Resource Model (NRM):** a model representing the actual managed
telecommunications network resources that a System is providing through the
subject IRP.\ An NRM identifies and describes IOCs, their associations,
attributes and operations.\ The NRM is also referred to as \"MIM\" (see
above), which originates from the ITU-T TMN.

# 4 System overview
## 4.1 Compliance rules
The following defines the meaning of Mandatory and Optional IOC attributes and
associations between IOCs, in Solution Sets to the IRP defined by the present
document:
  * The IRPManager shall support all mandatory attributes/associations.\ > The IRPManager shall be prepared to receive information related to > mandatory as well as optional attributes/associations without > failure; however the IRPManager does not have to support handling > of the optional attributes/associations.
  * The IRPAgent shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. It > may support optional attributes/associations.
An IRPAgent that incorporates vendor-specific extensions shall support normal
communication with a 3GPP SA5‑compliant IRPManager with respect to all
Mandatory and Optional IOCs, attributes and associations without requiring the
IRPManager to have any knowledge of the extensions.
Given that:
  * rules for vendor-specific extensions remain to be fully specified; > and
  * many scenarios under which IRPManager and IRPAgent interwork may > exist;
it is recognized that the IRPManager, even though it is not required to have
knowledge of vendor-specific extensions, may be required to be implemented
with an awareness that extensions can exist and behave accordingly.
# 5 Modelling approach
The modelling approach is described in the \"Generic network resources IRP
NRM\" (3GPP TS 32.622 [6]).
It should be noted that this model allows for combined Managed Element
functionality, where more than one \'function IOCs\' (inherited from
ManagedFunction) modelling more specific managed element functionality may be
contained in the ManagedElement IOC.

## 6.2 Class diagram
### 6.2.1 Attributes and relationships
This clause depicts the set of IOCs that encapsulate information relevant for
this service. This clause provides the overview of all information object
classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of
various aspects of these information object classes.
The figures below show the containment/naming hierarchy and the associations
of the information object classes defined in the present document.
1) NOTE: The listed cardinality numbers represent transient as well as >
steady-state numbers, and reflect all managed object creation and > deletion
scenarios in all figures.
Each IOC is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to 3GPP TS
32.300 [4] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example, the DN of
an IOC representing a MME (3GPP TS 23.401 [9]) could have a format like:
1) SubNetwork=China, MeContext =MEC-Gbg-1, ManagedElement =MME-Gbg-1, >
MMEFunction=MME-1.

Editor's Note:\ The above diagram model/support "1
MMEFunction/ExternalMMEFunction can at most belong to one MMEPool."
Technically, there is no identified problem of supporting "1
MMEFunction/ExternalMMEFunction participates in more than one MMEPool".
However, support of such configuration is complex and costly. Use Case
justification would be required.
### 6.2.2 Inheritance
This clause depicts the inheritance relationships that exist between IOCs.
The figures below show the inheritance hierarchy for the EPC NRM.

( Ref.3GPP TS | | | | 23.003[14]). | | | | | | | | Note: | | | | | | | | An UE, supported by a cell, can | | | | connect to one out of a group | | | | of MMEs. The group consists of | | | | the MMEs supporting the | | | | tracking area for the cell | | | | limited to those that are | | | | connected to the serving eNB. | | | | The MME is identified by the | | | | combination PLMNID-MMEGI-MMEC. | | | | The combination is called | | | | GUMMEI. | | +-------------------+---------------------------------+--------------+ | mMEPool | It is the DN of a MMEPool | | | | instance. | | +-------------------+---------------------------------+--------------+ | mMEPoolArea | It is the DN of a MMEPoolArea | | | | instance. | | +-------------------+---------------------------------+--------------+ | mMEPoolMemberList | It is the list of DNs of | | | | MMEFunction instances of the | | | | MMEPool. | | +-------------------+---------------------------------+--------------+ | pLMNIdList | It is a list of PLMN-Id, | | | | PLMN-Id= Mobile Country Codes | | | | (MCC)\|\| Mobile Network | | | | Codes(MNC) (Ref. 3GPP TS | | | | 23.003[14]) | | | | | | | | The MMEPoolArea.pLMNIdList | | | | purpose is to identify the | | | | PLMNs (related to MMEFunction) | | | | the MME Pool is serving. | | | | | | | | The MMEEunction.pLMNIdList | | | | purpose is as following. One | | | | operator may have several PLMN | | | | Ids and accordingly RAN | | | | broadcasts these Ids to enable | | | | UEs of different PLMN (i.e, UEs | | | | with different MNC in their | | | | IMSIs) to access its network. | | | | If CN node does not know this | | | | PLMN list, UEs of different | | | | PLMN than the one combined in | | | | MME might be treated as UEs | | | | from other operators.
