# Introduction
The present document studies the problems and potential improvements in the
way user data is introduced and handled in the 3GPP based networks. Related to
these studies this Technical Report investigates the need to introduce a
common end-user profile storage framework into 3GPP conformant communication
networks.
The introduction of a Common Profile Storage Framework of User Data
(\"Common\" in the sense of common to all applications) for network services
and management applications could significantly enhance the ability of 3GPP
based networks to offer complex and combined services in the areas of:
  * Multimedia.
  * Data services.
  * Value Added Services.
  * End-to-end applications.
In light of developments both within 3GPP (e.g. IMS, MBMS, OCS, PCC) and
outside 3GPP (e.g. NGN, OMA, etc.) with a growing number of physically
disjoint but logically correlated user data stored in several data bases a
consolidation and co-ordination of these is needed to prevent further
redundancy and possible contradiction and to enable operators to administer
and provision complex and combined services.
Initial study of the user related data within and outside 3GPP is necessary to
assess the properties of such a Common User Profile Storage Framework based on
  * the needs of Network Elements like MMS-RS, HLR, HSS, BM-SC; and
  * features like Service Management, Subscription Management and > Charging Management.
On-going efforts within the mobile and NGN community to define advanced
services within the network (i.e. 3GPP, TISPAN) should provide valuable drive
for developing the Common Profile Storage Framework functionality for 3GPP.
# 1 Scope
The present document investigates possibilities to introduce an end-user
profile storage framework into 3GPP conformant communication networks. To this
end the following topics are covered:
  * Analysis of the consequences of creating one common data model > structure for an end user:
\- Existing data specifications concerning an end-user or a subscriber in
3GPP, TISPAN, OMA and other relevant standardization groups are listed and
used as a basis for the proposal of a structure for a common end-user data
model.
\- Topics connected to the fact that one common data model exists, like
minimizing data redundancy, access control, providing views for applications
are highlighted.
\- The relationship between an end user and a subscriber as defined by 3GPP is
revisited in light of the fact that the relations between subscribers
(contract holders) and end-users can be n:m.
  * Current initiatives connected to subscription information carried > out inside and outside 3GPP are covered.
  * Analysis of differences and deficiencies concerning 3GPP\'s current > status of specifications (e.g. GUP, SuM, etc.) in comparison to > existing/emerging solutions with centralized or distributed > storage models.
  * Identification of items for standardization as a result of the > analysis described in the bullet above.
# 2 References

## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply:
NOTE: A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the
definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**adaptation layer function:** function provided by the Common Profile Storage
Framework to decouple any application from the actual data store
**application:** this notion is only used in the contexts of the respective
standard documents\ This means that the explanation can be found in the cited
reference documents.
**application front end:** data access part of an application of the Common
Profile Storage (CPS) Framework
**contract holder:** A Contract Holder is a Subscriber that makes a (sub-)set
of his subscribed services available to the End-Users that are assiciated with
the Subscriber
**data entities:** logical data model is an abstract DBMS-independent
representation of a set of data entities and their relationships within the
scope of a system\ A logical data model typically includes all the entities
and their attributes that correspond to a set of specified information
requirements, which includes the definition of logical constraints on these
attributes.
**end user:** person actually consuming a service, in 3GPP defined as user in
opposition to a subscriber
**network function:** function within the 3GPP or OMA, etc., service
Architecture or Management Network making use of the Common Profile Storage
(CPS) Framework

# 4 Rationale for the Analysis of a Common User Model and of the Basic
Structure of a Common Profile Storage Framework
This clause provides motivation for:
  * the analysis of a common end-user model; and
  * the analysis of a Common Profile Storage Framework.
All aspects are dealt with in two steps. The first step is the statement of
motivating ideas corroborated by use cases and the second step is the
formulation of required steps of investigation following from the motivation
part.
## 4.1 Motivation - Use Cases
**_Motivating Statement 1: Characterizing an end-user versus a contract
holder_**
Looking at 3GPP\'s data definitions in [2] it focuses on the subscription of
services. It is organized into the following blocks:
  * Definition of subscriber data for CS and PS domain:
\- Data related to subscription, identification and numbering.
\- Data related to Mobile Station types.
\- Data related to authentication and ciphering.
\- Data related to roaming.
\- Data related to basic services.
\- Data related to supplementary services.
\- Mobile station status data.
\- Data related to Operator Determined Barring.
\- Data related to handover.
\- Data related to short message support.
\- Data related to subscriber trace.
\- Data related to the support of voice group and broadcast calls.
\- Data related to GPRS NAM.
\- Data related to CAMEL.
\- Data related to IST.
\- Data related to Location Services.
\- Data related to Super-Charger.
\- Data related to bearer service priority.
\- Data related to charging.
  * Definition of subscriber data for IP Multimedia domain:
\- Data related to subscription, identification and numbering.
\- Data related to registration.
\- Data related to authentication and ciphering.
\- Data related S-CSCF selection information.
\- Data related to Application and service triggers.
\- Data related to Core Network Services Authorization.
\- Data related to Charging.
\- Data related to CAMEL Support of IMS Services.
In [2] these data are not organized into any specific structure. It is [5],
which standardizes 3GPP\'s view of the interdependencies between the data
entities defined in [2]. The root entity is the IMSI, which characterizes a
subscriber as can be seen in the following figure1 in the non-GPRS case:
{width="3.9375in" height="6.958333333333333in"}
Figure 4.1.1: Organization of subscriber data in the non-GPRS case according
to [5]
In the GPRS case, 3GPP defines the following structure [5].
{width="3.9583333333333335in" height="4.541666666666667in"}
Figure 4.1.2: Organization of subscriber data in the GPRS case according to
[5]
In both cases (non-GPRS and GPRS) the IMSI is the root for all further data
concerning the properties of subscribed services.
In order to describe the end user as opposed to a subscriber 3GPP provides a
model in the SuM specification [7].
{width="5.996527777777778in" height="3.9256944444444444in"}
Figure 4.1.3: Organization of SuM data according to [7]
The user, in the present document also called \"end user\", is defined in 3GPP
[1]: **User:** _An entity, not part of the 3GPP System, which uses 3GPP System
services. Example: a person using a 3GPP System mobile station as a portable
telephone._
There is no further definition of a user within 3GPP. The following use case
represents a class of use cases, where one person is assigned more than one
IMSI from the same operator, which can, at the moment not be reflected in a
data model according to [2].
**_Use Case 1: End user possesses a business cellular and a private cellular
from the same provider_**
The business phone is provided to the end user by the company he/she works
for. As it is used frequently and many supplementary services are subscribed
to, the SIM card (i.e. the IMSI) and indirectly thus also the user is assigned
a very high rating for customer service.
The private cellular is subscribed to by the end user himself, using as little
additive services as possible, selecting the cheapest possible tariff. In this
case the SIM card (i.e. the IMSI) and indirectly thus also the user is
assigned a very low rating for customer service.
This situation is not satisfying for the end user, who receives different
treatment from the same provider depending on the SIM card he uses. It is also
not very satisfying for the provider, who would like to avoid this situation,
if he only could link the two subscribers to the same end user.
**_Motivating statement 2_**
A user may have several devices (User Equipment, UE) each equipped with a
UICC, UICC can even be exchanged between devices. On each UICC a USIM and
several ISIM may be present. The information of co-located USIM and ISIM is
not present in any current 3GPP register.
**_Use case 2_**
A network operator wants to provide users of his network combined services
spanning CS, PS and IMS. For this knowledge about the user\'s UEs and his
identities in the mentioned domains is needed, i.e. IMSIs (CS/PS) and Private
Identities (IMS).
**_Motivating statement 3_**
A user using services under different subscriptions with multiple devices can
not be handled as one end-user as no correlations exist between his MSISDNs
and his Public Identities. Public user identities may be shared across
multiple Private User Identities within the same IMS subscription. Hence, a
particular Public User Identity may be simultaneously registered from multiple
UEs that use different Private User Identities and different contact
addresses.
**_Use case 3_**
A network operator wants to provide users of his network combined services
spanning CS, PS and IMS. For this knowledge about the user\'s UEs and his
identities in the mentioned domains is needed, i.e. MSISDNs (CS/PS) and Public
Identities (IMS).
**_Motivating Statement 4: Avoiding inconsistent subscriber/end-user
databases_**
Looking at a fraction of 3GPP\'s network architecture [13] in figure 4.1.4.
{width="5.996527777777778in" height="4.289583333333334in"}
Figure 4.1.4: Part of the architecture of a 3GPP network according to [13]
it should be noted that data about one and the same end user are stored in the
HLR, AuC, EIR, VLR and the SCP. Some of them (e.g. in the HLR, VLR and SCP)
are necessary for a correct call processing and thus need to be kept
consistent all the time.
**_Use Case 4: End user makes use of an IN service, which allows setting call
forwarding numbers_**
An end user is member of an IN based VPN and uses the property \"follow me\",
which allows him/her to be reached within the VPN at different locations. The
MSISDNs configured in the SCP as \"follow me\" numbers could at the same time
be blocked in the HLR by ODB, which would lead to the situation that the IN
service \"follow me\" could never be used. So considerable effort has to be
spent, in order to keep the two data bases synchronized.
**_Motivating Statement 5: High complexity in end user life cycle
management_**
Identifying an end user has several implications:
  * It provides the possibility of extending the existence of the user > within the database after his/her card has been deleted. > Information like preferences could thus be kept and in case of > renewing the end-user\'s subscription, these preferences could > automatically be used again.
  * It may facilitate end user self management as it is easier for a > vendor/provider to implement single sign on solutions
  * It also leads to some obligations:
\- Openness:
  * Means for establishing the existence and nature of personal data.
  * Main purpose of the use of the data.
\- Collection Limitation:
  * Limits to collection of personal data.
  * Acquisition by lawful and fair means (evtl. with knowledge and/or > consent of data subject).
\- Purpose specification:
  * Purpose, for which the data are collected, must be known latest at > the moment of the beginning of the data collection.
  * Use of the data shall be limited to the fulfilment of those > purposes.
\- Limitation of data usage:
  * Non-disclosure of personal data.
  * Use limited to purpose negotiated (subject to mutually agreed change > requests).
**_Use Case 5_**
According to [46], technical identities simply are numbers, which can
represent any object; they may identify directly or indirectly an individual,
an organization, or a machine.
From the privacy perspective one should note [46] that even if those
identifiers do not directly represent an individual, but only a specific
device, frequently there is a relation to a person so that many of these
identities have to be regarded as at least potentially personal data. But as
the existence and the disclosure of those IDs often goes unnoticed by the
users, managing them is quite difficult: In many cases technology does not
provide the functionality to influence assignment, storage and disclosure of
those IDs.
**_Motivating Statement 6: High data redundancy_**
Many of the end user data, which are necessary for call setup, can be found
duplicated in the involved network elements. Using the network scenario in
figure 4.1.4 and 3GGP\'s [5] as a reference, the following use case shows the
existing data redundancy concerning the HLR, VLR and SGSN.
**_Use Case 6: End user data common to HLR and VLR (SGSN)_**
The VLR and SGSN store only a subset of the subscriber data available in the
HLR. Updating of subscriber information shall be done in a way to make
available and to keep consistency of data shared between the HLR and the VLR,
and between the HLR and the SGSN as appropriate.
Two different cases for the updating of subscriber data can be identified:
  * framed operation: during location update or restoration a complete > set of the shared subscriber data needs to be inserted in the VLR > or the SGSN;
  * stand-alone operation: whenever subscriber data are added, deleted > or changed in the HLR, this may need partial insertion, deletion > or change of shared subscriber data in the VLR or the SGSN.
According to [5] the following groups of non-GPRS subscriber information are
defined:
  * Subscriber information (Group A):
\- International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI);
\- basic Mobile Station International ISDN Number (MSISDN);
\- category;
\- subscriber status;
\- LMU identifier (GSM only).
  * Basic service information (Group B):
\- Bearer Service list;
\- Teleservice list.
  * Supplementary Service (SS) information (Group C):
\- forwarding information including deflection information;
\- call barring information;
\- Closed User Group (CUG) information;
\- eMLPP data;
\- MC data;
\- SS Data.
  * Operator Determined Barring (ODB) information (Group D):
\- ODB Data for non-GPRS services;
  * Roaming restriction information (Group E):

\- LCS Service Types.
  * IST Information (Group J):
\- IST data.
  * Bearer Service Priority Information (Group L):
\- Bearer Service Priority Data.
  * Administrative Restriction Information (Group M):
\- Access Restriction Data.
The following groups of GPRS subscriber information are defined:
  * Subscriber information (Group P1):
\- International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI);
\- basic Mobile Station International ISDN Number (MSISDN);
\- subscriber status.
  * Basic service information (Group P2):
\- Teleservice list.
  * Operator Determined Barring (ODB) information (Group P3):
\- ODB Data for GPRS services.
  * Roaming restriction information (Group P4):
\- roaming restriction in SGSN due to unsupported feature.
  * Regional subscription information (Group P5):

\- GMLC List;
\- LCS Privacy Exception List;
\- MO-LR List;
\- LCS Service Types.
  * Administrative Restriction Information (Group P12):
\- Access Restriction Data.
These data are located both in the HLR and in the VLR or SGSN. They are
transferred from the HLR according to the following rules defined in [5]:
The following rules shall apply for non-GPRS subscriber data for the order of
information within an HLR-VLR dialogue:
  * Group A information (subscriber status) shall be sent first;
  * Group B information shall be sent after Group A information and > before any Group C, E, F, G, H, J, L, M or X information;
  * Group D information shall be sent after Group A information and in > any order with respect to Group B, C, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M and X > information.
The following rules shall apply for GPRS subscriber data for the order of
information within a dialogue:
  * Group P1 information (subscriber status) shall be sent first;
  * Group P2 information shall be sent after P1 information and before > P4 and P5 information;
  * Group P3 information shall be sent after Group P1 information and in > any order with respect to Group P2, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P11 and > P12 information.
**_Motivating Statement 7: NEs providing end user oriented services (e.g. HLR)
need to be highly available_**
Each of the network elements of a 3GPP conformant network containing a
subscriber database needs to be highly available. Otherwise the functionality
provided by this network element is not available for the end users stored in
its database.
**_Use Case 7: End user data stored within the HLR_**
At the moment the IMSI, which is the key identity of a subscriber, is bound to
a specific HLR. Procedures like a location update or a mobile terminating call
for one specific subscriber can only function, if the HLR in question is known
and functioning.
**_Motivating Statement 8: Alternative possibilities of retrieving end-user
data in comparison to using today\'s SS7 protocol stacks, allowing for a
simpler handling of data queries within an operator\'s domain._**
Some of the end user data can be queried via the SS7 protocol stack. Typical
examples are the Anytime Interrogation (ATI) and the Anytime Modification
(ATM) provided by MAP. This interface is highly complicated and requests like
ATM and ATI create a certain load on the call processing part of the network.
The following two use cases just show what may be possible, there would be
others (e.g. an MMSC has to send multiple requests to get the necessary end-
user data).
**_Use Case 8: MAP and SCP_**
Today the SCP of IN systems uses the MAP interface for Any Time Interrogation
and Any Time Modification for the reading and/or modification of e.g. Call
Forwarding Information.
**_Use Case 9: MAP and MNP_**
Today Mobile Number Portability (MNP) needs more than one step towards the
acquisition of the final routing information. A central subscriber profile
store would allow the same result with one read access only.
**_Motivating Statement 9: Not all information stored within an end-user store
can be retrieved._**
Some of the end user data are stored for purposes of the respective network
element of a 3GPP network, which would be very welcome for other network
functions, but cannot be retrieved from there.
**_Use Case 10: Location Information stored in the VLR_**
Within the VLR, amongst other information LAC information is stored. This
information would be very welcome to e.g. presence services and/or management
applications, but at the moment it cannot be retrieved without implementing -
e.g. in the GSM case - a MAP interface.
## 4.2 Resulting required steps of investigation
**_Required step of investigation 1:_**
Following motivating statement 1 and motivating statement 7 the end user, as
described in [7], has to be introduced formally into the data model [2] and
its relations to a subscriber have to be formalized.
**_Required step of investigation 2:_**
Following motivating statement 1 all services provided by a 3GPP based
network, which can be assigned to an end user should also be capable of being
retrieved by identifying this end user within the database
**_Required step of investigation 3:_**
Following motivating statement 4 and motivating statement 6, it should be
investigated if it is possible to identify data with identical semantic
context and store these in one database only (an example would be call
forwarding number, which are stored in the HLR as well as in the SCP)..
**_Required step of investigation 4:_**
Following problem statement 5, the identity defined by the characteristics of
an end user has to be managed according to legal obligations. The following
list highlights some of them:
The following legal acts just represent examples:
  * Europe: The main legal sources of the protection of individual > identity are
\- Constitutions;
\- International Treaties:
  * Treaties of the European Union;
  * European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and > Fundamental Freedoms;
  * European Directives;
  * National Law;
  * Other national Regulations.
  * The aspects of human personality that are protected by the above > mentioned legal sources are:
\- One\'s name and the identity;
\- Freedom from physical constriction (habeas corpus);
\- Inviolability of the domicile and right of privacy;
\- Freedom of speech and self expression, in particular:
  * The right to choose one\'s image;
  * The right to protect one\'s honour;
\- Freedom of movement and to settle (granted only to fully aged people).
  * One of the important European Directives is:
\- The European Directive 95/46/CE: deals with data protection, is aimed at
giving to the data subject (owner of data) the most control possible on its
own identity and personal data, posing a series of requirements on recipients,
controllers, processors and even third parties. Art. 2, letter a), giving a
definition of \"personal data\", says: \"identifiable person is one who can be
identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical,
physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity\".
\- The main principles behind the Data Protection Directive are:
  * Personal data must always be processed fairly and lawfully;
  * Personal data must be collected for explicit and legitimate purposes > and used accordingly;
  * Personal data must be relevant and not excessive in relation to the > purpose for which they are processed;
  * Data that identify individuals must not be kept longer than > necessary;
  * Data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date;
  * Data controllers are required to provide reasonable measures for > data subjects to rectify, erase or block incorrect data about > them;
  * Appropriate technical and organizational measures should be taken > against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data;
  * Personal data must not be transferred to a country or territory > outside the European Economic Area unless that country ensures an > \"adequate level of protection\" for data subjects.
\- USA:
  * Privacy Act of 1974: all government agencies - federal, state and > local - which request social security numbers are required to > provide a disclosure statement on the form;
  * Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA, also known as the > \"Buckley Amendment,\" enacted in 1974, 20 USC 1232g): social > security numbers fall within the scope of personally identifiable > information that is restricted from disclosure by schools that > receive federal funding under the Family Educational Rights and > Privacy Act;
  * Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) - 15 U.S. Code > 6501 et seq.: The act\'s goal is to place parents in control over > what information is collected from their children online;
  * Financial Services Modernization Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB), > Privacy Rule - 15 USC 6801-6827: The 1999 federal law permits the > consolidation of financial services companies and requires > financial institutions to issue privacy notices to their > customers, giving them the opportunity to opt-out of some sharing > of personally identifiable financial information with outside > companies;
  * Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) - 47 U.S. Code 227: This > law puts restrictions on telemarketing calls and on the use of > autodialers, pre-recorded messages, and fax machines to send > unsolicited advertisements.
**_Required step of investigation 5:_**
Following motivating statement 7, motivating statement 8 and motivating
statement 9, the possibility of NEs being made end-user dataless and putting
these end user data into a common end user storage facility should be
investigated.
Use case 10 leads to the question, whether it makes sense to perhaps only
store the VLR data within a CPSF, if it turns out that the VLR is not one of
the NEs, which lends itself to user dataless operation.
**_Required step of investigation 6:_**
Following use case 8, possibilities to migrate to a less complex signalling
network topology should be investigated.
**_Required step of investigation 7:_**
According to use cases 2 and 3 a correlation of the UEs used by an end-user
and his identities in the CS, PS and IMS domains has to be established.
NOTE: All required steps of investigation have to lead to findings, which are
backwards compatible to today\'s 3GPP network scenarios.
# 5 Considerations on a Common User Model
This clause has multiple intentions concerning considerations on a common user
model.
At the beginning, in clause 5.1, a classification of subscriber/end-user data
is given. This clause mainly serves the purpose of showing, what roles the
services related to subscriber/end-user data might play and for which kind of
services to expect subscriber/end-user data. In addition the realization of
these services within a network and the location of the respective end user
data within the network are shown. The specific structure of this clause is
only of limited importance for the subsequent analysis of the properties of a
common user model.
Clause 5.2 lists all relevant standards pertaining to subscriber/end-user data
for the network functions treated in clause 5.2 within and outside of 3GPP.
Clause 5.3 highlights some of the current difficulties when handling
subscriber/end-user data in more detail.
Finally clause 5.4 deals with the important points to consider, when putting
together a common end-user data model.
## 5.1 Network Functions and Management Applications Using Subscriber/User
Data
In this clause the network functions/services as well as enterprise
applications, which make up a 3GPP conformant network, or which could be put
onto a 3GPP conformant network and which use or house end-user/subscriber data
are listed and classified.
Two types of functions/services using end-user/subscriber data can be
distinguished:
  * Network functions: These network functions can be found within the > 3GPP\'s, OMA\'s, IETF\'s, etc., network architectures.
  * Enterprise applications: These can be found within the OSS/BSS > environment of a network/service provider.
Clause 5.1 groups the network functions according to the type of service, they
provide or at least support.
The rest of this clause is devoted to an overview of the standardized network
scenarios including those network elements, which use or store subscriber
data.
### 5.1.1 Network Supporting Services
#### 5.1.1.1 UMTS, CS and PS Network Supporting Services
##### 5.1.1.1.1 Location Register
[13] describes, how communication to a mobile station is supported by the
network. The information where this mobile station is located is stored in a
function named \"location register\".
According to [13] the location register is handled by four different entities.
  * The Home Location Register (HLR): register to which a mobile > subscriber is assigned for record purposes such as subscriber > information.
  * The Visitor Location Register (VLR): register for Circuit Switched > (CS) services, other than the HLR, used by an MSC to retrieve > information for, e.g. handling of calls to or from a roaming > mobile station currently located in its area.
  * The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN): register function in the SGSN > storing subscription information and location information for > Packet Switched (PS) services for each subscriber registered in > the SGSN (needed only in a PLMN which supports GPRS).
  * The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN): register function in the GGSN > storing subscription information and routeing information (needed > to tunnel packet data traffic destined for a GPRS MS to the SGSN > where the MS is registered) for each subscriber for which the GGSN > has at least one PDP context active (needed only in a PLMN which > supports GPRS).
A basic configuration of a PLMN for UMTS is given in [13]. The following
figures show the configurations of the mobile network in the GSM, GPRS and
UMTS case.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="5.572222222222222in"}

Figure 5.1.1.1.3: Basic Configuration of a UMTS PLMN supporting CS\ and PS
services and interfaces [13]
The HSS (see figure 5.1.1.1.3) is the master database for a given user. It is
the entity containing the subscription-related information to support the
network entities actually handling calls/sessions.
The HSS houses the following user related information:
  * User Identification, Numbering and addressing information.
  * User Security information: Network access control information for > authentication and authorization.
  * User Location information at inter-system level: the HSS supports > the user registration, and stores inter-system location > information, etc.
  * User profile information.
According to [13] the HSS has the following functions:
  * IP multimedia functionality to provide support to control functions > of the IM subsystem. It enables subscriber usage of the IM CN > subsystem services.
  * The subset of the HLR/AUC functionality required by the PS Domain.
  * The subset of the HLR/AUC functionality required by the CS Domain, > if it is desired to enable subscriber access to the CS Domain or > to support roaming to legacy GSM/UMTS CS Domain networks.
Thus the HSS is a realization of parts of the location register functionality
mentioned above.
The VLR contains the information needed to handle the calls set-up or received
by the MSs registered in its data base including the following elements:
  * the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI);
  * the Mobile Station International ISDN number (MSISDN);
  * the Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN),
  * the Temporary Mobile Station Identity (TMSI), if applicable;
  * the Local Mobile Station Identity (LMSI), if used;
  * the location area where the mobile station has been registered;
  * the identity of the SGSN where the MS has been registered. > (applicable to PLMNs supporting GPRS and a Gs interface between > MSC/VLR and SGSN);
  * the last known location and the initial location of the MS.
The VLR also contains supplementary service parameters attached to the mobile
subscriber and received from the HLR. The organization of the subscriber data
is outlined in 3GPP TS 23.008 [2].
The location register function in the SGSN contains:
  * subscription information:
\- the IMSI;
\- one or more temporary identities;
\- zero or more PDP addresses.
  * location information:
\- depending on the operating mode of the MS, the cell or the routeing area
where the MS is registered;
\- the VLR number of the associated VLR (if the Gs interface is implemented);
\- the GGSN address of each GGSN for which an active PDP context exists.
The organization of the subscriber data in the SGSN is defined in [2] and
[17].
The location register function in the GGS stores subscriber data received from
the HLR and the SGSN in order to be able to handle originating and terminating
packet data transfer:
  * subscription information:
\- the IMSI;
\- zero or more PDP addresses.
  * location information:
\- the SGSN address for the SGSN where the MS is registered.
The organization of the subscriber data in the GGSN is defined in [2] and
[17].
##### 5.1.1.1.2 The Equipment Identity Register (EIR)
The EIR is part of the GSM system, responsible for storing in the network the
International Mobile Equipment Identities (IMEIs), which may be classified as
\"white listed\", \"grey listed\" and \"black listed\" and therefore may be
stored in three separate lists.
##### 5.1.1.1.3 The Mobile-services Switching Centre (MSC) Server (Media
Control)
The MSC is the interface between the radio system and the fixed networks
handling the circuit switched services to and from the mobile stations. The
MSC Server mainly comprises the Call Control (CC) and mobility control parts
of a MSC. To this end it also contains a VLR to hold the mobile subscriber\'s
service data and CAMEL related data.
The MSC Server controls the parts of the call state that pertain to connection
control for media channels in a CS-MGW (thus the name Media Control).
#### 5.1.1.2 IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Network Supporting Services
The configuration of IP Multimedia Subsystem Core Network Subsystem entities
is presented in figure 5.1.1.2.1. In the figure, all the functions are
considered implemented in different logical nodes. If two logical nodes are
implemented in the same physical equipment, the relevant interfaces may become
internal to that equipment. More information on the functions can be found
from 3GPP TS 32.002 [13].
Only the interfaces specifically linked to the IM subsystem are shown.
Legend:
> Bold lines: interfaces supporting user traffic;
>
> Dashed lines: interfaces supporting only signalling.
Figure 5.1.1.2.1: Configuration of IM Subsystem entities
Figure 5.1.1.2.2 depicts an overall view of the functional architecture for
services.
Figure 5.1.1.2.2: Functional architecture for the provision of service in the
IMS
The Subscription Locator Function (SLF), the Serving Call Session Control
Function (S-CSCF), the Application Server (AS) and the IM-SSF are relevant
when considering where user data in existing networks is stored. More
information on IMS subscriber data and where it is stored can be found in 3GPP
TS 23.008 [2].

### 5.1.2 Enabling Services
#### 5.1.2.1 Presence Service
##### 5.1.2.1.1 IETF
In [39] IETF describes the Presence Service facilities as accepting
information, storing it, and distributing it. Architecturally it has two
distinct sets of \"clients\":
  * Presentities: provide presence information to be stored and > distributed.
  * Watchers: receive presence information from the service.
{width="4.722916666666666in" height="3.3819444444444446in"}
Figure 5.1.2.1.1.1: Overview over presence service support defined by IETF
[39]
There are two kinds of Watchers:
  * Fetchers: requests the current value of some Presentity\'s presence > information from the Presence Service. A special kind of Fetcher > (the Poller) is one that fetches information on a regular basis.
  * Subscribers: requests notifications from the Presence Service of > changes in some Presentity\'s presence information.
IETF\'s model for Presence Information consists of an arbitrary number of
elements, called \"presence tuples\". Each such element consists of:
  * a status marker: (e.g. online/offline/busy/away/do not disturb);
  * a communication address: optional (containing communication means > and communication address);
  * other presence mark-up: optional.
{width="4.677083333333333in" height="5.645833333333333in"}
Figure 5.1.2.1.1.2: Overview over presence information defined by IETF [39]
The IETF model includes additional elements that are useful in characterizing
how the protocol and mark-up work:
  * Principals: people, groups, and/or software in the \"real world\" > outside the system using the system as a means of coordination and > communication.
A Principal interacts with the system via one of several user agents:
  * INBOX USER AGENT.
  * SENDER USER AGENT.
  * PRESENCE USER AGENT.
  * WATCHER USER AGENT.
{width="6.7625in" height="4.510416666666667in"}
Figure 5.1.2.1.1.3: Overview over presence system defined by IETF [39]
Information Model of [39]:
  * Access Rules: constraints on how a presence service makes presence > information available to Watchers. For each presentity\'s presence > information, the applicable Access Rules are manipulated by the > Presence User Agent of a Principal that controls the Presentity.
  * Communication Address: consists of
\- Communication Means: indicates a method whereby communication can take
place (e.g. instant message service).
\- Contact Address: a specific point of contact via some Communication Means
(e.g. for an instant message service it is the instant inbox address).
  * Fetcher: a form of Watcher that has asked the Presence Service to > for the Presence Information of one or more Presentities, but no > Subscription to be created.
  * Notification: a message sent from the Presence Service to a > Subscriber when there is a change in the Presence Information of > some Presentity of interest, as recorded in one or more > Subscriptions.
  * Other Presence Markup: any additional information included in the > Presence Information of a Presentity [39] does not define this > further.
  * Poller: a Fetcher that requests Presence Information on a regular > basis.
  * Presence Information: consists of one or more Presence Tuples.
  * Presence Service: accepts, stores, and distributes Presence > Information:
\- May require authentication of Presentities, and/or Watchers.
\- May have different authentication requirements for different Presentities.
\- May have different authentication requirements for different Watchers, and
may also have different authentication requirements for different Presentities
being watched by a single Watcher.
\- May have an internal structure involving multiple servers and/or proxies.
There may be complex patterns of redirection and/or proxying while retaining
logical connectivity to a single Presence Service.
\- The service may be implemented as direct communication among Presentity and
Watchers.
\- May have an internal structure involving other Presence Services, which may
be independently accessible in their own right as well as being reachable
through the initial Presence Service.
  * Presence Tuple: consists of a Status, an optional Communication > Address, and optional Other Presence Markup.
  * Presence User Agent: means for a Principal to manipulate zero or > more Presentities.
  * Presentity (presence entity): provides Presence Information to a > Presence Service.
  * Note that the presentity is not (usually) located in the presence > service: the presence service only has a recent version of the > presentity\'s presence information. The presentity initiates > changes in the presence information to be distributed by the > presence service.
  * Principal: human, program, or collection of humans and/or programs > that chooses to appear to the Presence Service as a single actor, > distinct from all other Principals.
  * Proxy: a server that communicates Presence Information, > subscriptions and/or notifications to another server. Sometimes a > Proxy acts on behalf of a Presentity or a Watcher.
  * Server: an indivisible unit of a Presence Service.
  * Status: a distinguished part of the Presence Information of a > Presentity. Status has at least the mutually-exclusive values OPEN > and CLOSED. There may be other values of Status that may be > combined with OPEN and CLOSED or they may be mutually-exclusive > with those values.
  * Subscriber: a form of Watcher that has asked the Presence Service to > notify it immediately of changes in the Presence Information of > one or more Presentities.
  * Subscription: the information kept by the Presence Service about a > Subscriber \'s request to be notified of changes in the Presence > Information of one or more Presentities.
  * Visibility Rules: constraints on how a Presence Service makes > Watcher Information available to Watchers. For each Watcher \'s > Watcher Information, the applicable Visibility Rules are > manipulated by the Watcher User Agent of a Principal that controls > the Watcher.
  * Watcher: requests Presence Information about a Presentity, or > Watcher Information about a Watcher, from the Presence Service. > Special types of Watcher are Fetcher, Poller, and Subscriber.
  * Watcher Information: information about Watchers that have received > Presence Information about a particular Presentity within a > particular recent span of time. Watcher Information is maintained > by the Presence Service, which may choose to present it in the > same form as Presence Information.
  * Watcher User Agent: means for a Principal to manipulate zero or more > Watchers controlled by that Principal.
##### 5.1.2.1.2 3GPP
The Presence Service for GSM and GPRS [21] provides the ability for the home
network to manage presence information of a user\'s device, service or service
media even whilst roaming. A user\'s presence information may be obtained
through input from the user, information supplied by network entities or
information supplied by elements external to the home network. Consumers of
presence information, watchers, may be internal or external to the home
network.
The principal architecture of the 3GPP presence service is summarized in
figure 5.1.2.1.2.1.
{width="6.686805555555556in" height="3.6319444444444446in"}
Figure 5.1.2.1.2.1: Reference Architecture for Presence service support
defined by 3GPP [21]
[21] describes a 3GPP subscriber by the following attributes: _subscriber\'s
status, communication means status, one or more communication address(es)_
(containing _communication means_ and _contact address_)_, location
(subscriber provided location and/or network provided location), priority,
text._
The attributes can be categorized as:
  * communication means and contact address specific information: > _communication means_ status, communication means, contact > address, priority and text; or
  * generic information: subscriber\'s status, location and text.
In [21] these attributes are assigned the following values:
  * Generic information attributes:
\- Subscriber\'s status (willing, willing with limitations, not willing, not
disclosed).
\- The subscriber\'s status attribute is not intended to be used when
interworking with IM clients. Subscribers are able to provide more detailed
willingness information as well as other information through the generic Text
attribute, and the communication means and contact address specific Text
attribute.
\- Location (Last known CGI/SAI and/or geographic co-ordinates and/or free
format text and timestamp).
\- Text (free format text).
  * Communication means and contact address specific information > attributes, if these attributes are used as part of any tuple they > shall use following values (values in parenthesis) to enable > interoperability:
\- communication means status (online, offline);
\- communication means (Service type (e.g. telephony, SMS, email, multimedia
messaging service, instant messaging service));
\- contact address (E.164 (e.g. MSISDN), SIP URL, Email, Instant message
address e.g. IM:name\@domain name);
\- priority (Priority order for each of the defined communication means and
contact address);
\- text (free format text).
##### 5.1.2.1.3 _3GPP2_
The principal architecture of the 3GPP2 presence service is summarized in
figure 5.1.2.1.3.1.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="4.388888888888889in"}
Figure 5.1.2.1.3.1: Reference Architecture for Presence service support
defined by 3GPP2 [29]
[29] describes a 3GPP2 subscriber by the following attributes:
  * subscriber\'s status;
  * communication means status;
  * one or more communication address(es) (containing communication > means and contact address);
  * location (subscriber provided location and/or network provided > location);
  * priority;
  * text.
The only information element, which differs from 3GPP in the name is the
element \"contact information\", from \"communication means\" , which replaces
\"contact address\".
##### 5.1.2.1.4 OMA
OMA\'s Presence Framework leverages IETF\'s protocols and formats for presence
in its SIMPLE (SIP Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions)
activity (see RFC 3856 [101]).
3GPP [21] and 3GPP2 [29] have defined an aligned Presence Service framework
both in the:
  * \"network layer\": communication that is required between the > Presence Service functional elements (e.g. Presence Server) and > various network elements as they are defined in the network > architectures of 3GPP and 3GPP2 (e.g. MSC, HLR); and
  * \"application layer\": communication that is required between the > various Presence Service elements (e.g. Presence Server and > Presence Source), which includes the \"application layer\" > functional entities;
defining end-to-end presence information flows.
In addition OMA\'s Presence Architecture supports presence services that do
not leverage core network infrastructure as defined by 3GPP and 3GPP2, but
which are still relevant to the mobile domain. The following picture shows the
SIMPLE reference architecture on which it is based.
{width="6.6875in" height="4.843055555555556in"}
Figure 5.1.2.1.4.1: SIMPLE Reference Architecture for Presence service support
based on IETF [31]
_Presence Source_
The Presence Source is an entity that provides presence information to a
Presence Service [31]. It can be located in the user\'s terminal or within a
network entity.
When the SIP/IP Core network corresponds with 3GPP IMS or 3GPP2 MMD networks,
the Presence Source can be implemented in a UE or an AS as defined in 3GPP and
3GPP2 respectively.
The following figure shows an architecture for the PNA in the case that no
3GPP/3GPP2 network represents the core.
{width="4.617361111111111in" height="3.022222222222222in"}
Figure 5.1.2.1.4.2: OMA Reference Architecture for Presence service support\
in a non-3GPP/3GPP2 case [30]
**_Watcher_**
The watcher is an entity that subscribes to presence information about a
presentity or list of presentities (i.e. presence list) [30].
When the SIP/IP Core network corresponds with 3GPP IMS or 3GPP2 MMD networks,
the watcher can be implemented in a UE or an AS as defined in 3GPP and 3GPP2.
**_Presence Server_**
The Presence Server (PS) is an entity that accepts, stores and distributes
presence information. The PS performs the following functions:
  * Handles publications from one or multiple Presence Source(s) of a > certain presentity. This includes:
\- refreshing presence information;
\- replacing existing presence information with newly published information;
or
\- removing presence information, for a given Presence Source.
  * Composes the presence information received from one or multiple > Presence Source(s) into a single presence document.
  * Handles subscriptions from watchers to presence information and > generates notifications about the presence information state > changes.
  * Handles subscriptions from watcher information subscribers to > watcher information and generates notifications about the watcher > information state changes.
  * Authorizes the watcher\'s subscription to the presentity\'s presence > information and applies policies.
  * Applies the watcher\'s event notification filtering preferences, as > appropriate.
  * Applies rate control mechanisms to the notifications, as > appropriate.
When the SIP/IP Core network corresponds with 3GPP IMS or 3GPP2 MMD networks,
the PS is implemented in an AS as defined in 3GPP and 3GPP2 respectively.
**_Resource List Server_**
The Resource List Server (RLS) performs the following functions:
  * Accepts subscriptions to presence lists.
  * Authorizes the watcher\'s usage of the presence list.
  * Creates and manages back-end subscriptions to all presentities in > the presence list, on behalf of the watcher.
  * Sends notifications to the watcher, based on information received > from the back-end subscriptions.
  * Applies aggregation and rate control mechanisms to the > notifications, as appropriate.
When the SIP/IP Core network corresponds with 3GPP IMS or 3GPP2 MMD networks,
the RLS has to be implemented in an AS as defined in 3GPP and 3GPP2
respectively.
**_XDM Client_**
The XDM Client has to support the XDM Client procedures and the XCAP
application usages.
**_Presence XDMS_**
The Presence XDMS has to support the XDM Server procedures and the XCAP
application usages.
**_RLS XDMS_**
The RLS XDMS has to support the XDM Server procedures and the XCAP application
usages.
**_Content Server_**
The Content Server has to support IETF\'s HTTP GET and PUT methods [30], and
the procedures defined in [30].
The Content Server has to store a MIME object when receiving it in an HTTP PUT
request behind the HTTP URI therein.
The Content Server has to return a MIME object in a 200 OK response to an HTTP
GET request. The Content Server has to fetch the MIME object from the Request
URI of the HTTP GET request.
The Content Server can be used by Presence Sources, Watchers and the Presence
Server as described in figure 5.1.2.1.4.
**_The Presence data model_**
The Presence Data Model defined by IETF (see above) is categorized in four key
components: the Presentity URI, the Person, the Service and the Device:
  * The Presentity\'s URI component indicating the Presentity\'s > identifier (e.g. SIP URI, tel. URI)
  * The Person components model the information about the Presentity: > The \"person\" component models information about the Presentity > whom the presence data is trying to describe. It has the following > components:
\- Overriding Willingness.
\- Activity.
\- Location.
\- Time Zone.
\- Mood.
\- Icon.
\- Class.
\- Geographical Location (location info, usage rules).
\- Note.
\- Timestamp.
The model supports only one \"person\" component per presentity, or a group,
which appears to the watcher as a single Presentity.
NOTE: According to [30] more than one \"person\" component instance may exist
in the Presence document in cases where composition policy in the PS cannot
clearly semantically differentiate between the multiple instances of the same
component.
  * The Service components model the forms of communication used by the > Presentity and has potentially access to:
\- Application-specific Availability (registration state, barring state).
\- Application-specific willingness.
\- Icon.
\- Session Participation.
\- Service Description.
\- Class.
\- Per service device identifier (device-id).
\- Communication address (contact).
\- Timestamp.
One important characteristic of each \"service\" might be the devices on which
that service executes. Each device is uniquely identified by the device
identifier \. A service may contain zero or more \
elements to indicate which devices that service is available on. The Presence
document may contain information on each device, but this is a separate part
of the document modelled by the \"device\" component.
The \"service\" component has to be mapped to the \ element specified
in [31].
  * The Device components model the physical pieces of equipment used by > the Presentity:
\- Network Availability.
\- Geographical Location (location-info, location-rules).
\- Device identifier (device-id).
\- Timestamp.
Examples of Presence information that can be represented by \"device\"
elements include mobile phones, PCs and PDAs.
The mapping of services to devices is many to many. Devices are uniquely
identified with a device identifier. The model supports only one \"device\"
component per device identifier, however the Presence Sources publish their
own \"device\" component instances. The PS composes the multiple instances
into one component and resolves conflicts among the Presence Sources according
to [30].
The \"device\" component has to be mapped to the \ element, which is
specified in [31].
For a given presentity, the value of the \ element of the \
element have to be unique for each device used by the presentity.
A version 4 UUID as defined in [30] has to be used for \ to uniquely
identify the device. This is a purely random identifier, providing uniqueness.
It is not allowed to change over the lifetime of the device and has to be
stored in a non-volatile memory. It has to be used in all the Presence
publications requiring the use of \.
The relationship between the data elements is shown in figure 5.1.2.1.4.3.

#### 5.1.2.2 Location Service
##### 5.1.2.2.1 3GPP
The functional model defined in [18] and presented in figure 5.1.2.2.1.1
includes functional entities for both CS and PS related LCS. In addition, it
consists of all the entities needed for different positioning methods:
  * i.e. network based;
  * mobile based;
  * mobile assisted; and
  * network assisted positioning, exploiting:
\- either uplink; or
\- downlink measurements.
NOTE: The UE may use e.g. the GPS positioning mechanism, but still demand e.g.
auxiliary measurements from the serving network. RAN specific functional

The LCS client Subscription profile shall contain a minimum set of parameters
assigned on per LCS client basis for an agreed contractual period. The LCS
client profile shall contain the following set of access parameters:
  * LCS client identity;
  * allowed LCS request types (i.e. LIR, LDR or both) (see note);
  * maximum number of subscribers allowed in a single LCS request;
  * priority;
  * position override indicator;
  * state(s);
  * event(s) (applicable to LDR requests only);
  * local coordinate system;
  * LCS client access barring list (optional);
  * PLMN access barring list applicability.
##### 5.1.2.2.2 OMA
For certain authorized LCS clients internal to the PLMN, a subscription
profile is unnecessary. These clients are empowered to access any defined
service that is not barred for an UE subscriber. This permits positioning of
emergency calls without the need for pre-subscription.
The OMA Mobile Location Service V1.0 (MLS V1.0 [34]) consists of a set of
location specifications complying with 3GPP Release 6 LCS Specification [18].
The Architecture of MLS V1.0 as described in [34] defines four reference
points Le, Lr, Lpp and Lid. It also describes the components in the
architecture as shown in figure 5.1.2.2.2.1:
  * Location Privacy Checking Entity that is described in [18], > clauses 6.3.11 and 6.3.12.
  * MLS Client that is described in [18], clause 6.3.2.
  * Requesting Location Server, Home Location Server and Visited > Location Server that are described in [18], clause 6.3.3.

#### 5.1.2.3 XDM
##### 5.1.2.3.1 OMA
Various network functions such as, Presence, Push to Talk Over Cellular (PoC),
Instant Messaging (IM), etc. need to access and manipulate certain information
(e.g. the list of PoC participants who can take part in a PoC session as well
as additional PoC-specific properties, the lists of PoC callers who are
allowed/not allowed to call a given user, a list of users who are potential
presentities, so that this list can be used to collectively subscribe to the
presence status of each member in that list, an access control policy for
Presence, which specifies whether a particular watcher is authorized to
subscribe to a certain set of events).
NOTE: Such information is not always composed of pure lists (of principals),
but can be a combination of lists together with other properties that define
an end-user\'s personalization of the service behaviour.
The XDM enabler [35] specifies documents that can be shared by multiple
enablers. One such case is a particular type of list, the URI List, which is a
convenient way for a principal to group together a number of end users (e.g.
\"Friends\" or \"Family) or other resources, where such a list is expected to
be reused for a number of different enablers. Such a list can be re-used
wherever a principal has a need to collectively refer to a group of other end
users or resources.
> URI lists: The end-user can store URI information about other end-users to
> later initiate URI with them or to subscribe for their presence. A URI list
> is an essential basis for other OMA enabler (such as, PoC or messaging) as
> the addresses on the URI list are used to set up a session.
>
> Group lists: Groups described in [35] are used for communication sessions
> (e.g. PoC sessions) or immediate messaging sessions for chat rooms. The
> group has properties (e.g. \"open\" or \"restricted\") that sets the rules

**_XDM Client_**
  * has to support the XDM Client procedures (document management, > subscription to changes in XML documents); and
  * the XCAP application usages (XCAP-Server Capabilities, XML Documents > Directory).
When the SIP/IP Core network corresponds with 3GPP IMS or 3GPP2 MMD networks,
the XDM Client can be implemented in a UE or an AS as defined in [22].
**_Aggregation Proxy_**
The Aggregation Proxy is the contact point for the XDM Client implemented in
an UE to access XML documents stored in any XDMS. When realized with 3GPP IMS
or 3GPP2 MMD networks, the Aggregation Proxy shall act as an Authentication
Proxy defined in [23].

Figure 5.1.2.4.1.1: Document Structure for Device Management defined by OMA
[35]
The OMA DM v1.2 specifications are based on the OMA Device Management (DM)
v1.1.2 specifications and make use of the OMA SyncML Common v1.2
specifications as specified in the OMA SyncML common specification as can be
seen in figure 5.1.2.4.1.1.
The SyncML Initiative, Ltd. was a not-for-profit corporation formed by a group
of companies who co-operated to produce an open specification for data
synchronization and device management.
The SyncML Initiative merged with the Open Mobile Alliance in November 2002\.
The SyncML legacy specifications were converted to the OMA format with the
1.1.2 versions of OMA SyncML Common, OMA Data Synchronization and OMA Device
Management in May 2002.
The SyncML specification contains the following main components:
  * An XML-based representation protocol.
  * A synchronization protocol and a device management protocol.
  * Transport bindings for the protocol.
A device description framework for device management OMA DM management objects
are defined using the OMA DM Device Description Framework [DMTND], or DDF.
The following figure gives an example of OMA\'s definition of device
information.
{width="4.9527777777777775in" height="4.552083333333333in"}
Figure 5.1.2.4.1.2: Example of a management object for Device Management
defined by OMA [36]
Figure 5.1.2.4.1.2 provides some points to note:
  * All the blocks with names in place occur exactly once, except Ext > and Bearer that are optional and may not be present at all.
  * The named node DevInfo has child nodes and is an interior node. With > the exception of Ext and Bearer, which can have children, the > other named nodes are leaf nodes.
  * The un-named leaf nodes marked with * can be represented by any > number of instantiated nodes at run-time, including none. The only > limit is that the node names must be unique and memory must be > available to store the nodes.
As part of the common definitions OMA [36] provides the following management
objects:
DMAcc: the management object is used to manage settings for the OMA DM
protocol.
DevInfo:
  * Ext: An optional, interior node, designating the only branch of the > DevInfo sub tree into which extensions can be added, permanently > or dynamically.
  * Bearer: An optional, interior node of the DevInfo sub tree in which > items related to the bearer (CDMA, etc.) are stored. Use of this > sub tree can be mandated by other standards.
  * DevId: A unique identifier for the device, which should be globally > unique and must be formatted as a URN as defined in RFC 2141 > [102].
  * Man: The manufacturer identifier.
  * Mod: A model identifier (manufacturer specified string).
  * DmV: OMA device management client version identifier (manufacturer > specified string).
  * Lang: The current language setting of the device. The syntax of the > language tags and their use are defined in RFC 1766 [103]. > Language codes are defined by ISO in the standard ISO 639 [104].
DevDetail:
  * Ext: An optional, interior node, designating the only branch of the > DevDetail sub tree into which extensions can be added, permanently > or dynamically.
  * Bearer: An optional, interior node, designating a branch of the > DevDetail sub tree into which items related to the bearer (CDMA, > etc.) are stored. Use of this sub tree can be mandated by other > standards.
  * URI/MaxDepth: Specifies the maximum depth of the management tree > supported by the device. The maximum depth of the tree is defined > as the maximum number of URI segments that the device supports. > The value is a 16 bit, unsigned integer encoded as a numerical > string. The value \"\'\"\' means that the device supports a tree > of \"unlimited\" depth.
  * URI/MaxTotLen: Specifies the maximum total length of any URI used to > address a node or node property. The maximum total length of a URI > is defined as the largest total number of characters making up the > URI which the device can support. Note that depending on the > character set this might not be the same as the number of bytes. > The value is a 16 bit, unsigned integer encoded as a numerical > string. The value \"\'0\"\' means that the device supports URI of > \"\'unlimited\'\" length.
  * URI/MaxSegLen: Specifies the maximum total length of any URI segment > in a URI used to address a node or node property. The maximum > total length of a URI segment is defined as the largest number of > characters which the device can support in a single URI segment. > Note that depending on the used character set this might not be > the same as the number of bytes. The value is a 16 bit, unsigned > integer encoded as a numerical string. The value \"\'0\"\' means > that the device supports URI segments of \"\'unlimited\'\" length.
  * DevTyp: Device type, e.g. PDA, pager, or phone.
  * OEM: Original Equipment Manufacturer of the device.
  * FwV: Firmware version of the device.
  * SwV: Software version of the device.
  * HwV: Hardware version of the device.
  * LrgObj: Indicates whether the device supports the OMA DM Large > Object Handling specification, as defined in [DMPRO].
Inbox:
In some circumstances a Management Object\'s URI is not the preferred
addressing method and the management object identifier is enough information
for the device to resolve a suitable location for that Management Object. In
that case the URI: \"./Inbox\" is a reserved location for this purpose.
As part of the SyncML definitions OMA [37] provides the following management
objects.
SyncML DM:
The SyncML DM management object consists of two parts.
  * The first part is the DMAcc node which is where the SyncML DM > specific settings are stored. These settings are collectively > referred to as a SyncML DM account.
  * The second part is Con, which is used for connectivity settings > needed to communicate with a SyncML DM server. The sub tree of the > Con node is similar to what a generic connectivity management > object might look like and there is also substantial overlap with > WAP Provisioning parameters here.
DevInfo: see above
DevDetail: see above
**_Example: Client Provisioning_**
According to [68] Client Provisioning is the process by which a device is
initially configured with connectivity and application access parameters. This
covers
  * OTA provisioning; and
  * provisioning by means of, e.g. Smart cards.
The actors involved in Client Provisioning include (see [68]):
  * Management Authorities (including Network Operators, Enterprise > Managers, Service Providers);
  * Device Management Systems;
  * Subscribers; and
  * Users.
According to [68] a Device (e.g. a handset or PDA) has to be provisioned with
correct Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) parameters so that the user is able
to access the WLAN service:
  * network identifier;
  * operation mode;
  * security and authentication related parameters;
  * etc.
The Device provisioning can be done via a local or public transport
mechanisms, e.g. IR, Bluetooth, local, or non-local, wired, or wireless
network.
#### 5.1.2.5 Authorization and Authentication
##### 5.1.2.5.1 ITU-T
ITU-T Recommendation X.509 [44] defines a framework for public-key
certificates, which includes the specification of:
  * data objects used to represent the certificates themselves; as well > as
  * revocation notices for issued certificates that should no longer be > trusted.
In addition ITU-T Recommendation X.509 [44] defines a framework for attribute
certificates, which includes specification of:
  * data objects used to represent the certificates themselves; as well > as
  * revocation notices for issued certificates that should no longer be > trusted.
In order for a user to be able to trust a public-key for another user, for
instance to authenticate the identity of that user, ITU-T Recommendation X.509
[44] defines how the public-key is to be obtained from a trusted source. Such
a source, called a Certification Authority (CA), certifies a public key by
issuing a public-key certificate which binds the public-key to the entity
which holds the corresponding private-key.

  * Authority revocation list.
  * Delta revocation list.
  * Attribute certificate revocation list.

  * crlExtensions: if present, contains one or more CRL extensions.
The attribute certificate framework defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.509 [44]
provides a foundation upon which Privilege Management Infrastructures (PMI)
can be built. These infrastructures can support applications such as access
control.
The binding of a privilege to an entity is provided by an authority through a
digitally signed data structure called an attribute certificate or through a
public-key certificate containing an extension defined explicitly for this
purpose.
An attribute certificate using system needs to validate a certificate prior to
using that certificate for an application. Procedures for performing that
validation are also defined here, including verifying the integrity of the
certificate itself, its revocation status, and its validity with respect to
the intended use.
An attribute certificate is a separate structure from a subject\'s public key
certificate. A subject may have multiple attribute certificates associated
with each of its public key certificates. There is no requirement that the
same authority create both the public key certificate and attribute
certificate(s) for a user; in fact separation of duties will frequently
dictate otherwise.
The attribute certificate is defined as follows ITU-T Recommendation X.509
[44].
AttributeCertificate ::= SIGNED {AttributeCertificateInfo}

The Diameter base protocol [41] provides an Authentication, Authorization and
Accounting (AAA) framework for network functions such as network access or IP
mobility. Diameter is applicable in both local Authentication, Authorization
and Accounting and roaming situations.
Diameter can provide two different types of services to network functions:
  * Authentication and authorization, optionally making use of > accounting.
  * Accounting only.
[41] defines the following AVPs for Authentication and Authorization.
  * Origin-State-Id AVP: Origin-State-Id is used to allow rapid > detection of terminated sessions.
  * Auth-Request-Type AVP: The Auth-Request-Type AVP is included in > network function-specific auth requests to inform the peers > whether a user is to be authenticated only, authorized only or > both.
  * Session-Id AVP: The Session-Id AVP is used to identify a specific > session.
  * Authorization-Lifetime AVP: The Authorization-Lifetime AVP contains > the maximum number of seconds of service to be provided to the > user before the user is to be re-authenticated and/or > re-authorized.
  * Auth-Grace-Period AVP: The Auth-Grace-Period AVP contains the number > of seconds the Diameter server will wait following the expiration > of the Authorization-Lifetime AVP before cleaning up resources for > the session.
  * Auth-Session-State AVP: The Auth-Session-State AVP specifies whether > state is maintained for a particular session.
  * Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP: The Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP is included > in network function-specific auth answers to inform the client of > the action expected upon expiration of the Authorization-Lifetime.
  * Session-Timeout AVP: The Session-Timeout AVP contains the maximum > number of seconds of service to be provided to the user before > termination of the session.
  * User-Name AVP: The User-Name AVP (AVP Code 1) [RADIUS] is of type > UTF8String, which contains the User-Name, in a format consistent > with the NAI specification.
  * Termination-Cause AVP: The Termination-Cause AVP is used to indicate > the reason why a session was terminated on the access device.
  * Origin-State-Id AVP: The Origin-State-Id AVP is a monotonically > increasing value that is advanced whenever a Diameter entity > restarts with loss of previous state, for example upon reboot.
  * Session-Binding AVP: The Session-Binding AVP may be present in > network function-specific authorization answer messages.
  * Session-Server-Failover AVP: The Session-Server-Failover AVP may be > present in network function-specific authorization answer messages > that either do not include the Session-Binding AVP or include the > Session-Binding AVP with any of the bits set to a zero value.

RFC 3280 [42] profiles the format and semantics of certificates and
Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for the Internet PKI.
The users of certificates will operate in a wide range of environments with
respect to their communication topology, especially users of secure electronic
mail. This profile supports users without high bandwidth, real-time IP
connectivity, or high connection availability.
The following figure gives an overview over the basic building blocks of
IETF\'s PKI infrastructure.
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="5.0256944444444445in"}
Figure 5.1.2.5.2.1: PKI Entities defined by IETF [42]
The following paragraphs present the profile for public key certificates
according to RFC 3280 [42] that will foster interoperability and a reusable
PKI. This clause is based upon the X.509 v3 certificate format and the
standard certificate extensions defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.509 [44].
  * Certificate: The Certificate is a SEQUENCE of three required fields.
\- tbsCertificate: The field contains the names of the subject and issuer, a
public key associated with the subject, a validity period, and other
associated information.
\- SignatureAlgorithm: The signatureAlgorithm field contains the identifier
for the cryptographic algorithm used by the CA to sign this certificate.
\- SignatureValue: The signatureValue field contains a digital signature
computed upon the ASN.1 DER encoded tbsCertificate. The ASN.1 DER encoded
tbsCertificate is used as the input to the signature function.
  * TBSCertificate: The sequence TBSCertificate contains information > associated with the subject of the certificate and the CA who > issued it. Every TBSCertificate contains the names of the subject > and issuer, a public key associated with the subject, a validity > period, a version number, and a serial number; some MAY contain > optional unique identifier fields.
\- Version: This field describes the version of the encoded certificate.
\- Serial number: The serial number must be a positive integer assigned by the
CA to each certificate. It must be unique for each certificate issued by a
given CA (i.e. the issuer name and serial number identify a unique
certificate).
\- Signature: This field contains the algorithm identifier for the algorithm
used by the CA to sign the certificate.
\- Issuer: The issuer field identifies the entity that has signed and issued
the certificate. The issuer field MUST contain a non-empty distinguished name
(DN). The issuer field is defined as the X.501 type Name.
\- Validity: The certificate validity period is the time interval during which
the CA warrants that it will maintain information about the status of the
certificate. The field is represented as a SEQUENCE of two dates: the date on
which the certificate validity period begins (notBefore) and the date on which
the certificate validity period ends (notAfter).
\- Subject: The subject field identifies the entity associated with the public
key stored in the subject public key field.
\- Subject Public Key Info: This field is used to carry the public key and
identify the algorithm with which the key is used (e.g. RSA, DSA, or Diffie-
Hellman).
\- Unique Identifiers: These fields MUST only appear if the version is 2 or 3.
\- Extensions: This field must only appear if the version is 3.
In addition IETF uses the extensions defined for X.509 v3 certificates, which
provide methods for associating additional attributes with users or public
keys and for managing a certification hierarchy.
As discussed in [42], one goal of this X.509 v2 CRL profile is to provide the
basis for the creation of an interoperable and reusable Internet PKI. The
profile defines:
  * a set of information that can be expected in every CRL; and
  * common locations within the CRL for frequently used attributes as > well as common representations for these attributes.
The following items describe the use of the X.509 v2 CRL in the Internet PKI.
  * CertificateList: The CertificateList is a sequence of three required > fields.
\- tbsCertList: This field is itself a sequence containing the name of the
issuer, issue date, issue date of the next list, the optional list of revoked
certificates, and optional CRL extensions.
\- signatureAlgorithm: The signatureAlgorithm field contains the algorithm
identifier for the algorithm used by the CRL issuer to sign the
CertificateList.
\- signatureValue: The signatureValue field contains a digital signature

##### 5.1.2.5.3 3GPP
For 3G networks the following security features related to entity
authentication are provided [24]:
  * user authentication: the property that the serving network > corroborates the user identity of the user;
  * network authentication: the property that the user corroborates that > he is connected to a serving network that is authorized by the > user\'s HE to provide him services; this includes the guarantee > that this authorization is recent.
To achieve these objectives, 3GPP assumes that entity authentication occurs at
each connection set-up between the user and the network. To this end two
mechanisms have been defined:
  * an authentication mechanism using an authentication vector delivered > by the user\'s HE to the serving network; and
  * a local authentication mechanism using the integrity key established > between the user and serving network during the previous execution > of the authentication and key establishment procedure.
The SN may request the MS to send it the IMEI or IMEISV of the terminal. The
IMEI should be securely stored in the terminal.
User to USIM authentication restricts access to the USIM until the USIM has
authenticated the user. Thereby, it is ensured that access to the USIM can be
restricted to an authorized user or to a number of authorized users.
To accomplish this feature, user and USIM must share a secret (e.g. a PIN)
that is stored securely in the USIM. The user gets access to the USIM only if
he/she proves knowledge of the secret.
USIM to terminal authentication ensures that access to a terminal or other
user equipment can be restricted to an authorized USIM.
To this end, the USIM and the terminal must share a secret that is stored
securely in the USIM and the terminal.
Assignment of temporary identities allows the identification of a user on the
radio access link.
These are:
  * a temporary mobile subscriber identity (TMSI/Pâ€‘TMSI), which has > local significance only in the location area or routing area in > which the user is registered; and which
  * outside that area should be a accompanied by an appropriate:
\- Location Area Identification (LAI); or
\- Routing Area Identification (RAI) in order to avoid ambiguities.
The association between the permanent and temporary user identities is kept by
the Visited Location Register (VLR/SGSN) in which the user is registered.
Authentication by key agreement achieves mutual authentication by the user and
the network.
Both parties show knowledge of:
  * A secret key K which is shared between and available only to the > USIM and the AuC in the user\'s HE.
  * In addition the USIM and the HE keep track of counters:
\- SQN~MS~; and
\- SQN~HE~ respectively to support network authentication.
The sequence number SQN~HE~ is an individual counter for each user and the
sequence number SQN~MS~ denotes the highest sequence number the USIM has
accepted.
Upon receipt of a request from the VLR/SGSN, the HE/AuC sends an ordered array
of _n_ authentication vectors (the equivalent of a GSM \"triplet\") to the
VLR/SGSN. The authentication vectors are ordered based on sequence number.
Each authentication vector consists of the following components:
  * a random number RAND;
  * an expected response XRES;
  * a cipher key CK;
  * an integrity key IK and an authentication token AUTN.
Authorization of IMS-SIP based services has the following basic architecture
if the NAF is based in the home network.

Authorization of IMS-SIP based services has the following basic architecture
if the NAF is based in the visited network.
{width="6.761805555555555in" height="4.261805555555555in"}
Figure 5.1.2.5.3.2: Simple network architecture for bootstrap\ in the visited
network defined by 3GPP [23]
As described in [23], the generic Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) and the
UE shall mutually authenticate using the AKA protocol, and agree on session
keys that are afterwards applied between UE and a Network Application Function
(NAF).
After the bootstrapping has been completed, the UE and a NAF can run some
application specific protocol where the authentication of messages will be
based on those session keys generated during the mutual authentication between
UE and BSF.
In the case where UE has contacted a NAF that is operated in another network
than home network, this visited NAF shall use a Zn-Proxy of the NAFs network
to communicate with subscriber\'s BSF (i.e. home BSF).
The set of all user security settings (USSs), i.e. GUSS, is stored in the HSS.
In the case where the subscriber has multiple subscriptions, i.e. multiple
ISIM or USIM applications on the UICC, the HSS shall contain one or more GUSSs
that can be mapped to one or more private identities, i.e. IMPIs and IMSIs.
The required functionalities from the UE are:
  * the support of HTTP Digest AKA protocol;
  * the capability to use both a USIM and an ISIM in bootstrapping;
  * the capability to select either a USIM or an ISIM to be used in > bootstrapping, when both of them are present;
  * the capability for a Ua application on the ME to indicate to the GBA > Function on the ME the type or the name of UICC application to use > in bootstrapping;
  * the capability to derive new key material to be used with the > protocol over Ua interface from CK and IK;
  * support of NAF-specific application protocol.
The SLF:
  * is queried by the BSF in conjunction with the Zh interface operation > to get the name of the HSS containing the required subscriber > specific data;
  * is accessed via the Dz interface by the BSF.
##### 5.1.2.5.4 OMA
**_Internet Certificate Profile_**
In [38] OMA defines WAP certificate profiles. The profiles are mainly based on
the Internet Certificate Profile defined in RFC 3280 [42], which in turn is
based on the format defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.509 [44]. Specification
[38] provides, for each certificate type discussed, additional details
regarding the contents of some individual fields in the certificate.
Network functions must recognize all the following required distinguished name
attributes:
  * countryName;
  * organizationName;
  * organizationalUnitName;
  * stateOrProvinceName;
  * commonName;
  * domainComponent;
  * serialNumber.
CAs are not required to issue certificates with the:
  * serialNumber attribute;
but they should be able to do so.
All network functions must recognize all required distinguished name
attributes listed above. Further, they must recognize the serialNumber
attribute.
According to [38] certificate-processing network functions must recognize the
following standard extensions:
  * keyUsage;
  * extKeyUsage;
  * certificatePolicies;
  * subjectAltName; and
  * basicConstraints.
If the keyUsage extension is included, it shall have the:
  * digitalSignature bit;
set if the public key is an RSA key.
**_Global Permissions Management (GPM)_**
In OMA\'s current service environment framework, user permissions may be
distributed across multiple sources to address the service-specific solutions
required by each enabler (e.g. location services). In this case user
permissions involve dynamic data about an end-user:
  * location information that is to be shared only under certain conditions; and
  * how specific actions are to be executed in doing so.
Functionality to perform location privacy checking is being specified in OMA
for mobile location services using an optional privacy checking protocol (PCP)
defined over an interface between the location server and a separate privacy
checking entity. However mechanisms to allow the end-user to manage the
permissions rules governing the release of his/her own location are not
clearly specified nor mandated for mobile location services in OMA.
In Global Permissions Management, (GPM**)** [69], OMA **aims to specify an
enabler that is capable of generically managing permissions rules across OMA
service enablers** providing end-users with a global view of their
permissions**. These determine if, when, how and to what extent information
about a permissions target can be released.**
The [69] specifically identifies use cases and requirements from end-user and
service provider perspective. These show for example how:
  * Authorized principals express and manage their permissions rules > through user-friendly provisioning tools (not to be specified), > and manage related events such as being notified of changes to > permissions rules, or when /if consent is required and by whom.
  * Permissions rules are evaluated to determine what data can be shared > with whom and in what situations.
**According to [69] authorized principals can manage their permissions over
time in a logically centralized manner, e.g. by adding new services and having
these services re-use existing permission rules.**
**The following figure gives an idea of the actors involved in GPM.**
{width="6.690277777777778in" height="4.968055555555556in"}
Figure 5.1.2.5.4.1: Actors for GPM defined by [69]
**The Permissions Target is the principal who is the subject of permissions
rules that govern the way other principals access information about him and
ultimately how his services are executed. The Permissions Target is usually a
human end-user (or a group of human end-users) of services.**
**Permissions Manager: is an authorized principal who manages, (creates,
modifies, deletes, etc.) permissions rules.**
**Permissions Manager\'s Delegate: is a principal authorized by a Permissions
Manager to perform certain responsibilities on his/her behalf.**
**GPM Administrator: is responsible for determining who the authorized
permissions managers are, what their GPM management rights are, and to which
permissions targets those rights apply. The GPM Administrator is typically
employed by an operator or service provider.**
**Target Attribute Consumer: any principal who wishes to consume information
(target attributes) about the Permissions Target either directly or through
the invocation of a service.**
**Target Attribute Requester: is the actor who requests access to the
attributes of the Permissions Target (e.g. on behalf of the Target Attribute
Consumer).**
**Service provider: will want to use GPM to check permissions set for the
Permissions Target before any data about him is disclosed to the Requester as
part of its service delivery.**
**In [70] the following interfaces for the architecture shown in the figure**
5.1.2.5.4.2 **are defined:**
**GPM-1 (PEM-1): This interface is derived from PEM-1 [71], using the PEEM
defined process of using templates.**
**GPM-2 (PEM-2): This interface is derived from PEM-2 [71]. It allows
Authorized Principals to manage Permissions Rules.**
**Interface to other resources:** Like in the [x5, Clause 5.3.5], the
Interface to other external resources is not specified by GPM.
**The architecture [71] for PEEM is defined as follows:**
{width="6.157638888888889in" height="3.5819444444444444in"}
Figure 5.1.2.5.4.2: Architecture for PEEM defined in [71]
**The PEEM [71] enabler exposes the following interfaces:**
  * PEM-1 (PEEM specified callable interface);
  * PEM-2 (PEEM specified management interface);
  * Proxy interface (used for intercepting requests to target > resources).
**In addition to PEEM components and interfaces, there are other elements
represented in figure** 5.1.2.5.4.2 **for a better understanding of the
architectural diagram. The following is a list of other elements identified in
figure** 5.1.2.5.4.2 **that interact with PEEM [71]:**
  * Target Resource Requestor:
\- Target Resource Requestor represents a resource (e.g. application, enabler)
that issues a request to a target resource.
  * Target Resource:
\- Target Resource represents the destination resource for a request made by
another resource.
  * Delegated Resource:
\- Delegated Resource represents the resource to which PEEM may delegate
certain policy actions during the policy processing process.
  * Evaluation Requestor:
\- Evaluation Requestor represents a resource (e.g. application, enabler) that
issues a request for policy processing to PEEM.
  * Management Requestor:
\- Management Requestor represents a resource (e.g. application, enabler) that
issues a request for policy management to PEEM.
  * Interface to other resources:
\- The interface to other resources is not specified by PEEM, but is used to
exchange messages compliant to the interface of the target or delegated
enablers or more generally messages compliant to the target or delegated
resource interfaces.
**By definition (see [71]), policies are combinations of policy rules, each of
which is defined as a policy condition and actions (i.e. IF condition THEN
action).**
{width="4.23125in" height="3.522222222222222in"}
Figure 5.1.2.5.4.3: PEEM Information Model defined in [71]
**Evaluation may involve arbitrary computations. The conditions and actions in
policy rules may require the execution of arbitrary functions that include
delegation to OMA enabler implementations.**
**The topology of a policy is defined as a graph where each node represents a
condition to be evaluated and each outbound branch has actions to be executed
if the corresponding condition is true. This is illustrated in figure**
5.1.2.5.4.3**.**
**There are 2 execution models described by the IETF policy model defined in
RFC 3060 [87]:**
  * single condition at each node;
  * permits case statements on the nodes where each includes a priority > that determines the order of evaluation of these simple > conditions.

##### 5.1.2.6.3 3GPP
According to [47] GSM/UMTS networks provide functions that implement offline
and/or online charging mechanisms on the:
  * bearer (e.g. GPRS);
  * subsystem (e.g. IMS); and
  * service (e.g. MMS) levels.
In support the network performs real-time monitoring of resource usage on the
above three levels in order to detect the relevant chargeable events. The
charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.
Offline charging: the resource usage is reported from the network to the
Billing Domain after the resource usage has occurred.
Online charging: a subscriber account, located in an online charging system,
is queried prior to granting permission to use the requested network
resource(s).
[48] enumerates the requirements for charging according to 3GPP.
The following figure shows 3GPP\'s charging entity relationships for IMS
according to [48].
{width="6.690277777777778in" height="4.738888888888889in"}
Figure 5.1.2.6.3.1: Charging entity relationship defined by 3GPP [48]
The types of entities and the relevant type of charging as shown in figure
5.1.2.6.3.1 and described in [48] are as follows:
  * **Users:** retail charged by Mobile Network Operator or 3rd Party > Service Provider.
  * **3rd Party Service Providers:** wholesale charged by Mobile Network > Operator.
  * **Other telecommunications operators:** interconnect charging > between Mobile Network Operator and non-IP \"circuit-switched\" > Network Operators for call traffic carried; usage charging between > Mobile Network Operator and IP-based Network Operators for session > traffic carried.
  * **Other mobile operators:** roaming charging between these entities, > this may require different mechanisms for IP-based types from the > traditional \"circuit-switched\" types. Also, where mobile > operators need to pass traffic to one another, there will be > interconnect charging for non-IP \"circuit switched\" types; usage > charging for IP-based types.
  * **I-WLAN operators:** where I-WLAN operators need to pass traffic to > mobile operators or mobile operators to I-WLAN operators, there > may be roaming and usage charging.
  * **IP backbone carriers:** conveyance charging Mobile Network > Operators for traffic carried.
  * **3rd Party content & application suppliers:** supplier charging > between Mobile Network Operators and Value Added Service Providers > for information exchanged.
  * **3rd Party Portals:** access charging between Mobile Network > Operators and this entity.
  * **Internet:** charge for capacity of connection between Mobile > Network Operator and Internet. An Operator pays a provider for a > connection based on capacity, e.g. annual charge for a 2Mbit/s > \"pipe\".
According to [48] charging information is collected in the Serving Network to
record:
  * chargeable User or Mobile Station activity; and
  * inter-carrier connections.
This information is partly provided by the user, partly by the network element
of the serving network.
Depending on the type of charging information some of the data may not be
available or might not be required.
**Information provided by the user (user equipment) [48]:**
  * User identity used for authentication.
  * Home environment identity.
  * Terminal Identity and Terminal Class.
  * Destination endpoint identifier for service requested (e.g. B > number).
  * Resource requested (e.g. bandwidth, connectionless).
  * QoS parameters (e.g. maximum delay).
  * IP Multimedia capability requested (e.g. media components).
**Information provided by the serving network [48]:**
  * All of the information listed in clause above (Information provided > by the user).
  * Serving network identity.
  * Recording network element identity.
  * Universal Time (UT) at which the service request was initiated.
  * Universal Time (UT) at which the resource was allocated to the user.
  * Resource allocated to the user.
  * Quantity of data transferred both to and from the user.
  * QoS provided to the user.
  * Location of the user in the standard format used for 3GPP location > based services (e.g. geographical coâ€‘ordinates, Cell ID).
  * whether GSM Optimal Routing was applied.
  * If IN or CAMEL services were applied, the service parameters and the > actually used destination number and calling party number > identification.
  * Time duration covered by this charging information to an accuracy of > at least 1 second.
  * Unique identity of the chargeable event which allows the billing > system to correlate all charging information belonging to the same > chargeable event.
  * Unique charging information identity (unique per network element in > a period of about 100 days).
  * IP Multimedia capability provided to the user.
  * VAS information.
  * Identifier of third party accessed by the user.
  * Presence Information.
  * Service Identification (e.g. voice call, video call, data download, > etc.).
  * Supplementary Services used.
  * Prepay account identifier and related information.
**Charged Party [48]:**
  * Subscription related chargeable events:
\- the charging information shall indicate the charged party (i.e. normally
the calling party);
\- alternatively it should be possible to apply reverse charging; or
\- to charge the event to a party not involved in the event itself (e.g. a
company as VPN subscriber).
  * Inter-network chargeable events:
\- the charging information usually does not contain the charged party, but it
can be derived from network configuration information contained in the
charging event data.
**Information provided by the third party accessed by the user [48]:**
Supply of Value Added Services with the aid of third parties typically
represented by portals and content/application providers can be charged, if
the following charging information is provided by the third party:
  * Third party identity.
  * Type of service (information, entertainment, gaming, public > utility).
  * Type of content (picture, video clip, mp3 file, java file).
  * Universal Time (UT) at which the service request was initiated.

##### 5.1.2.6.4 OMA
**_MCC (Mobile Commerce and Charging)_**
The OMA Charging Enabler [74] enables charging for various types of Chargeable
Events to a subscriber\'s account, possibly maintained by an underlying
Charging Infrastructure. It is not a Charging Infrastructure in its own right.
{width="6.104166666666667in" height="4.489583333333333in"}
Figure 5.1.2.6.4.1: Charging Enabler Architecture [74]
The Charging Enabler Architecture - shown in the figure above - supports both
online and offline charging methods. For either method, any of the charging
functions listed below may be applied by the Charging Enabler.
Charging Events are generated by a Charging Enabler User as the result of a
user consuming a service. Each event will then be processed and potentially
modified by some combination of the following charging functions.
**_Quota Management_**
The Quota Management function is responsible for allocating and granting
quotas of service usage that a particular user may engage.
A Charging Enabler User that is granted a quota from the Quota Management
function is responsible for ensuring that the service usage does not exceed
the quota, or in some cases, may request additional quotas.
**_Correlation/Aggregation_**
Aggregation is the association of Charging Events generated by the same entity
over a period of time.
Correlation could occur between the Charging Events generated by different
entities while they are collaboratively providing a single service. The
correlation function provides an association of events for the
user/application that will be charged.
**_Rating_**
This function computes the price or value of a Charging Event indicating a
particular action performed by a service.
The rating function receives details of the event to be rated (i.e. the
Chargeable Event). The determination of the price or value of the event may be
based:
  * on one or several attributes of the Charging Event (for example > measures of volume, start and end time, or type of service > accessed); or
  * on other context factors (for example, information related to the > account which is to be charged).
**_Account Balance Management_**
For Charging Events of a particular subscriber, the Account Balance Management
function determines whether credit will be granted for service usage under the
following conditions (list not mandatory, nor exhaustive):
  * The service provider has enabled the Charging Enabler functionality.
  * The subscriber is known to the Charging Enabler instance.
  * The subscriber has sufficient credit, and has not exceeded any > spending limits configured for him.
  * The subscriber has not prohibited the Charging Enabler User that > issued the Charging Event (e.g. service barring).
  * The subscriber has given an explicit, interactive confirmation (user > consent) for the particular request, or has given advance consent > to be charged.
The interfaces shown in figure 5.1.2.6.4.1 support the following properties
[74].
**_Offline Charging Interface (CH-1)_**
This interface is used for offline Charging Event reporting. This interface
supports the following functions:
  * The sending of Charging Events after service delivery.
  * The sending of interim Charging Events during service delivery.
  * Correlation.
**_Online Charging Interface (CH-2)_**
This interface is used for online charging. This interface supports the
following functions:
  * Quota requests.
  * Renewed quota requests.
  * Reporting of portion of unused quota.
  * Rating.
  * Credit checking.
  * Correlation.
  * Refunding facility.
According to [75] the charging enabler has to fulfil the following
requirements:
When the OMA service layer is controlling the credit, according to [75] it
must be able to:
  * Accept an expiration time period for the credit acquired. Additional > causes for credit expiration could be also provided.
  * Accept credit that is shared among the several Service Providers > that are involved in providing a service, so the OMA service layer > provides credit control coordination for all the parties involved.
  * To acquire certain units of time/volume/events as the credit unit:
\- The credit acquired may be referred to service units in this way (i.e.
credit for 10 events).
\- Or the credit acquired may be monetary units with a relationship between
service units and credit (i.e. 10 monetary-units, the service is 1 monetary-
unit/event). The relationship between service units and credit does not imply
that monetary units can be converted into money.
  * It should be possible to acquire units of different measurements (i.e. volume and time, whichever ends first). This will allow a credit of the type (10 Megs or 5 minutes).
Rating of a service must consider:
  * All the elements involved in the delivery of the service, including > bearer charges, session charges and event/content charges.
  * Specific prices for that event due to bundling, promotions, > protected content, rights objects, etc.
  * The difference between requested capabilities and those provided > (i.e. the user asks for a premium service and he is granted a > normal one).
  * Account used for the charges.
The charging enabler must support charging input parameters related to the
service provided, which affect user/subscriber charges.
The charging enabler must consider three levels for charging:
  * Bearer.
  * Session.
  * Application/Content.
The charging enabler should consider that charging can be done based on:
  * Volume (upload, download, a combination of those), time and event.
  * Separated charges for each type of medium or service used.
  * Each leg of a service independently.
  * Technology used to deliver the service, including the QoS > requested/used to deliver the service.
  * Additional information (location, presence, push services), etc.
The charging enabler shall allow charging customers:
  * for obtaining services (e.g. WLAN access time, receiving the \"goal > of the day as a streamed video, or using a conference bridge); or
  * purchasing goods (e.g. weather forecasts or ring tones, protected > content or rights objects);
no matter what the nature of the services or goods are.
It shall be possible for the end-user to set limits for:
  * accumulated charges;
  * volume of transferred data;
  * number of events;
etc. per time interval.
It shall be possible for any party to add another media to the current service
delivery in progress and any of the parties can be charged for the additional
media.
During an active session, media types can change (e.g. audio changed to data)
and shall be charged for appropriately.
It shall be possible to charge the end-user according to the service used
irrespective of the technology used to deliver it.
It shall be possible to charge the end-user according to the technology used
to deliver a service.
The charging enabler must support resolving the account type of the end-user
(e.g. if the end-user has a prepaid or a post-paid agreement).
The charging enabler shall support widely used identification mechanisms to
identify the customer to the ACE. In particular, the charging enabler should
support the following:
  * MSISDN: The merchant may automatically determine the customer\'s > MSISDN (if the underlying communication protocol allows so, e.g. > if the service being charged for is based on a voice call), or > they may ask the customer explicitly to convey the MSISDN as an > identity (e.g. in a WLAN scenario).
  * Username/PIN[/TAN]: The customer may be requested to manually > enter this information.
  * IP address: Typically, the IP address is assigned by the ISP to user > agent devices. When the ISP also acts as the ACE, the IP address > could be used for identifying the customer.
  * Account numbers.
Services must be authorized prior to the delivery:
  * The service should be authorized in the Service Provider and the ACE > (provisioning).
  * The user should consent on the service delivery and the payment > method (user preferences).
  * The user must be authorized to use the service (not blacklisted).
  * The authorization can be provided at the same time that the service > itself (self-provisioning).
There must be a method to identify uniquely one instance of a service,
characterized at least by:
  * Service Provider\'s identifier (i.e. Network Identifier, 3rd Party > identifier, etc.).
  * Service Identifier.
  * User identifier.
  * Time and date.
The method will allow a spectator to differentiate between service instances
(e.g. to differentiate the same service sent to the same users in different
times -download of the same ring-tone twice).
The charging enabler must provide enough information for mechanisms based on
Fraud Avoidance and Revenue Assurance to work.
The charging enabler must provide a mechanism to ensure that the service can
be provided to the user for the charging perspective prior to the delivery of
it:
  * It must be possible to assure that the User has given its permission > to be delivered the service.
  * It must be possible to revocate the permission to deliver a service > for charging reasons.
  * It must provide Non-repudiation mechanisms to all the interfaces.
The charging enabler shall support subscription based charging.
The information used for charging should be secured by any means available.
For the end-user this means
  * Authentication of information and senders must be provided.
It must be possible to identify and authenticate all relevant participants
involved in a service delivery in order to ensure accurate charging and
prevent fraud, e.g.:
  * Customer (e.g. a mobile phone user).
  * Service Provider.
  * Network Operator.
  * Device (e.g. a mobile terminal).
It must be possible to use pseudonyms to refer to one user to maintain his
privacy:
  * In a way that makes it possible for the Third Party to differentiate > users (i.e. a unique way hash).
It must be possible for a user to identify anonymously to a Service Provider:
  * In a way that identifies an instance of a service to the ACE, > allowing only the ACE to identify the user and the account.
The choice of one method of anonymity may depend on user preferences, business
agreement, service necessities or other circumstances.
### 5.1.3 Network Hosted Business Services and Network functions
#### 5.1.3.1 MM Messaging Services (MMS)
##### 5.1.3.1.1 3GPP
According to [49] the MMS shall be able to support the ability to create,
update, store, transfer, interrogate, manage and retrieve a user\'s multimedia
messaging profiles.
  * Multimedia messaging profiles: allows a user to configure and > personalize his multimedia messaging environment with the > multimedia messaging profiles:
\- media types (e.g. voice only or text only); and
\- notifications that shall be delivered to the recipient.
The multimedia messaging profiles shall form part of the user\'s virtual home
environment.
  * User profile: allows the user to create and manipulate a list of > users, identified by their addresses, from which the user does not > want to receive messages (\"user-level blacklist\"). This > blacklist differs from ODB blacklist.
  * If the MMS supports a network based repository of MMs, it shall be > possible for the users to configure where incoming MMs will be > stored.
The corresponding network architecture, as described in [50], is shown in
figure 5.1.3.1.1.1.
{width="6.683333333333334in" height="4.800694444444445in"}
Figure 5.1.3.1.1.1: 3GPP\'s MMS Network Architecture [50]
**MMSNA**
According to [50] the Multimedia Messaging Service Network Architecture
encompasses all the various elements that provide a complete MMS to a user
(including interworking between service providers).
  * MMSE: a collection of MMS-specific network elements under the > control of a single administration.
  * MMS Relay/Server: is responsible for storage and handling of > incoming and outgoing messages and for the transfer of messages > between different messaging systems.
  * The MMS Relay/Server should be able to generate charging data > (Charging Data Record - CDR) when receiving MMs from or when > delivering MMs to another element of the MMSNA. The MMS > Relay/Server should be able to generate charging data for > VASP-related operations.
  * MMS User Databases: This element may be comprised of one or more > entities that contain user related information such as > subscription and configuration (e.g. user profile, HLR).
  * MMS User Agent: resides on a UE, an MS or on an external device > connected to a UE/MS. It is an application layer function that > provides the users with the ability to view, compose and handle > MMs (e.g. submitting, receiving, deleting of MMs).
  * MMS VAS Applications: The MMS VAS Applications offer Value Added > Services to MMS users. There could be several MMS VAS Applications > included in or connected to an MMSE.
Addressing [50]:
MMS shall support:
  * the use of E-Mail addresses (RFC 2822 [105]); or
  * MSISDN (E.164); or
  * both to address the recipient of an MM.
MMS may support the use of:
  * service provider specific addresses to address the recipient of > an MM.
\- In the case of E-Mail addresses standard internet message routing should be
used.
\- MMS may support short codes to address Value Added Services.
The usage of MSISDN for addressing a recipient in a different MMS service
provider\'s domain shall be possible. For that the need of MSISDN translation
to a routable address has been identified.
MMS connectivity across different networks (MMSEs) is provided based on
Internet protocols, thus each MMSE should be assigned a unique domain name
(e.g. mms.operatora.net).
MMS recipient addresses provided by an MMS User Agent may be in a:
  * format of an RFC 2822 [105] routable address, e.g. E-Mail address; > or
  * other formats, such as:
\- E.164; or
\- service provider specific addresses.
MMS shall support address hiding, i.e. anonymous messages where the sender\'s
address is not shown to the recipient MMS User Agent.
The MMS may have access to several User databases. These may consist of , e.g.
user profile database, subscription database, HLR.
These User Databases shall provide:
  * MMS user subscription information;
  * information for the control of access to the MMS;
  * information for the control of the extent of available service > capability (e.g. server storage space);
  * a set of rules how to handle incoming messages and their delivery;
  * information of the current capabilities of the user\'s terminal.
Figure 5.1.3.1.1.2 shows the MMS reference architecture:
{width="6.684027777777778in" height="5.122916666666667in"}
Figure 5.1.3.1.1.2: 3GPP\'s MMS Reference Architecture [50]
The Reference Architecture defines the following interfaces [50]:
  * MM1: The reference point between the MMS User Agent and the MMS > Relay/Server.
  * MM2: The reference point between the MMS Relay and the MMS Server.
  * MM3: The reference point between the MMS Relay/Server and external > (legacy) messaging systems.
  * MM4: The reference point between the MMS Relay/Server and another > MMS Relay/Server that is within another MMSE.
  * MM5: The reference point between the MMS Relay/Server and the Home > Location Register (HLR).
  * MM6: The reference point between the MMS Relay/Server and the MMS > User Databases.
  * MM7: The reference point between the MMS Relay/Server and MMS VAS > Applications.
  * MM8: The reference point between the MMS Relay/Server and the > post-processing system.
  * MM9: The reference point between the MMS Relay/Server and the online > charging system.
  * MM10: The reference point between the MMS Relay/Server and a > Messaging Service Control Function (MSCF).
##### 5.1.3.1.2 3GPP2
[66] defines the requirements for the MMS as a framework enabling non real-
time transmission of different types of media content, including:
  * Multiple media elements per single message.
  * Individual handling of message elements.
  * Different delivery methods for each message element.
  * Negotiation or accommodation of different terminal and network MM > capabilities.
  * Notification and acknowledgement of MM related events (e.g. > delivery, deletion, etc.).
  * Handling of undeliverable MM.
  * Personalized MMS configuration.
  * Flexible charging.
[66] allows network operators to design and configure networks in different
ways (see figure below). On the one hand, the MMS functionality could be
implemented within the core network (e.g. Scenarios 1 and 2), on the other
hand it may be placed on the periphery of the core network (e.g. Scenario 3 as
a centralized network model instead of a distributed architecture). Further,
some network operators may wish to support a limited set of MMS functionality,
while others may require extensive and elaborate MMS support according to
their business models (e.g. basic MMS instead of advanced MMS, Scenario 4). In
addition, some network operators may allow a 3rd Party MMS Provider to use
their networks for provisioning MMS (e.g. Scenario 5).

Figure 5.1.3.1.2.1: 3GPP2\'s MMS Reference Architecture [50]
**_User Profile Management_**
According to [15] the MMS shall support the ability to create, update, modify,
store, transfer, interrogate, and retrieve a user\'s multimedia messaging
profiles.
Multimedia messaging profiles: allow the user to configure and personalize
user\'s multimedia messaging environment with the multimedia messaging
profiles (e.g. which media types and notifications shall be delivered to the
recipient, such as voice only or text only).
The MMS profile shall support the user preference for message delivery.
The data that the user is allowed to personalize shall be managed and
controlled by the MMS.
**_Security_**
The user shall be able to use and access MM in a secure manner.
  * It shall be possible for the contents of an MM to be read only by > the intended recipient(s).
  * A recipient shall be reliably informed of the identity of the sender > in case the sender has authorized his identity to be transmitted.
  * The MMS shall have the ability to authenticate the user regardless > of access technology.
  * The MMS shall support data transport in a secure manner between the > user and MMS.
  * The MMS authentication scheme shall use access specific information.
**_Addressing:_**
The MMS shall support different addressing formats to identify the sender and
recipient. It shall be possible to submit one message to multiple recipients.
The MMS shall support the capability for both:
  * Mobile Directory Number (MDN); and
  * e-mail addressing schemes.
to be used, and the user may use either form of addressing to send a message.
The MMS shall be able to support the request to hide the sender\'s address
from the recipient.
##### 5.1.3.1.3 OMA
According to OMA\'s [72] the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is intended to
provide a set of content to subscribers in a messaging context. It supports
both sending and receiving of such messages by properly enabled client
devices.
{width="6.700694444444444in" height="4.179166666666666in"}
Figure 5.1.3.1.3.1: OMA\'s MMS Architecture [74]
The following entities are shown in figure 5.1.3.1.3.1:
  * MMS Client: This is the system element that interacts with the user > (could be implemented as an application on the user\'s wireless > device).
  * Application: This system element may interact with the MMS Client in > order to transport application specific data via MMS.
  * MMS Proxy-Relay: This is the system element, which represents the > interface to the MMS Client, provides access to the components > that provide message storage services, and it is responsible for > messaging activities with other available messaging systems.
  * MMS Server: This system element provides storage services for MM > messages.
  * Email Server: This system element provides traditional Internet > email services. supporting the SMTP protocol to send messages as > well as POP and/or IMAP protocols to retrieve messages.
  * Legacy Wireless Messaging Systems: Represents various systems that > currently exist in support of wireless messaging systems (includes > paging and SMS systems that provide messaging to a large number of > subscribers).
Figure 5.1.3.1.3.1 shows the following interfaces:
  * MMSm: the interface defined between the MMS Client and the MMS > Proxy-Relay.
  * MMSs: the interface defined between the MMS Server and the MMS > Proxy-Relay. This interface is not defined in the OMA > specifications.
  * MMSr: the interface defined between MMS Proxy-Relays of separate MMS > Systems. This interface is not defined in the OMA Specifications.
  * MMSA: the interface defined between the MMS Client and an > application that may use MMS to transport application specific > data, see clause 9. This interface is not defined in the OMA > Specifications.
  * E: the standard email interface used between the MMS Proxy-Relay and > internet-based email systems utilising SMTP, POP and IMAP > transport protocols, see clause. This interface is not defined in > the OMA Specifications.
  * L: the interfaces used between the MMS Proxy-Relay and legacy > wireless messaging systems. As there are various such systems, > this is viewed as being a set of interfaces. This interface is not > defined in the OMA Specifications.
Messaging systems are able to address the users in a way that can be efficient
for the system as well as meaningful for the senders of messages. This is
described in [72] and [73] as follows:
**_Internet Addressing_**
In the Internet world addresses are normally expressed in the email address
paradigm. In this scheme, addresses look like user\@system where the system
specification may be a domain name or a fully qualified host address. In
general, this scheme provides users the ability to have a complete and unique
address in an unbounded text string [72].
**_Wireless network addressing_**
In the wireless world, where bandwidth efficiency is critical, short address
lengths and ease of user entry on limited keypads are the hallmarks of the
various systems. The MMS addressing model, as defined in [73], makes a more
direct or efficient addressing scheme available to MMS subscribers and
services. This is seen as particularly important for interoperability with
legacy systems such as the above mentioned, and e.g. for mobile-to-mobile
operation.
The MMS addressing model contains two addresses:
  * the address of the MMS Proxy-Relay: shall be the URI of MMS > Proxy-Relay given by the MMS service provider;
  * the address of the recipient user and terminal: The addressing model > allows only single user in the terminal, thus combining the > address of the terminal and the user. The MMS Proxy-Relay has to > be able to parse the address formats described below, and it has > to be able to determine whether it supports the specified address > type or not.
The following is a copy of the description of the MMS addressing model
described in [73]:
address = ( e-mail / device-address / alphanum-shortcode / num-shortcode)
e-mail = mailbox ; to the definition of mailbox as described in clause 3.4 of
RFC 2822, but excluding the obsolete definitions as indicated by the \"obs-\"
prefix.
device-address = ( global-phone-number \"/TYPE=PLMN\" )
/ ( ipv4 \"/TYPE=IPv4\" )
/ ( ipv6 \"/TYPE=IPv6\" )
/ ( escaped-value \"/TYPE=\" address-type )
address-type = 1*address-char
; A network bearer address type
address-char = ( ALPHA / DIGIT / \"_\" )
escaped-value = 1*( safe-char )
; the actual value escaped to use only safe characters by replacing
; any unsafe-octet with its hex-escape
safe-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"+\" / \"-\" / \".\" / \"%\" / \"_\"
unsafe-octet = %x00-2A / %x2C / %x2F / %x3A-40 / %x5B-60 / %x7B-FF
hex-escape = \"%\" 2HEXDIG ; value of octet as hexadecimal value
global-phone-number = [\"+\"] 1*( DIGIT / written-sep )
written-sep =(\"-\"/\".\")
ipv4 = 1*3DIGIT 3( \".\" 1*3DIGIT ) ; IPv4 address value
ipv6 = 4HEXDIG 7( \":\" 4HEXDIG ) ; IPv6 address per RFC 2373
num-shortcode = [ ( \"+\" / \"*\" / \"#\") ] 1*DIGIT
alphanum-shortcode = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
Each value of a user-defined-identifier is a sequence of arbitrary octets.
They can be safely embedded in this address syntax only by escaping
potentially offending values. The conversion to escaped-value is done by
replacing each instance of unsafe-octet by a hex-escape which encodes the
numeric value of the octet.
Some examples of the mechanism:
To: 0401234567/TYPE=PLMN
To: +358501234567/TYPE=PLMN
To: Joe User \
To: FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210/TYPE=IPv6
To: 195.153.199.30/TYPE=IPv4
The terminal has to support at least one of the addressing methods.
#### 5.1.3.2 Content Services
##### 5.1.3.2.1 Digital Right Management (DRM)
##### 5.1.3.2.1.1 3GPP {#gpp-5 .H6}
3GPP states in [51] that DRM specifications are elaborated in the Open Mobile
Alliance (OMA) according to an agreement between 3GPP and OMA.
##### 5.1.3.2.1.2 OMA {#oma-7 .H6}
According to OMA [51] Digital Rights Management (DRM) supports the
distribution of content in order to enable business models whereby the
consumption and use of content is controlled. As such, DRM allows managing the
content lifecycle. When a user buys content, she may agree to certain
constraints - for example by choosing between a free preview version or a full
version at cost, or she may agree to pay a monthly fee. DRM allows this choice
to be translated into permissions and constraints, which are then enforced
when the user accesses the content.
In the OMA DRM architecture [51]:
  * functional entities (logical and need not represent physical network nodes) are used to embody specific roles in the DRM system; and
  * an actor is defined as an external entity involved in carrying out use cases. Depending on deployment scenario, different actors can play different roles in the system.
From the point of view of digital rights management, the following functional
entities have been identified in the architecture (see also figure
5.1.3.2.1.2.1):
  * DRM Agent.
  * A DRM Agent, a trusted entity in a device, is responsible for > enforcing permissions and constraints associated with DRM Content, > controlling access to DRM Content, etc.
  * Content Issuer.
  * The content issuer is an entity that delivers DRM Content according > to the format of DRM Content and the way DRM Content can be > transported from a content issuer to a DRM Agent defined by OMA.
  * Rights Issuer.
  * The rights issuer is an entity that assigns permissions and > constraints to DRM Content, and generates Rights Objects (XML > document expressing permissions and constraints associated with a > piece of DRM Content).
  * User.
  * A user is the human user of DRM Content. Users can only access DRM > Content through a DRM Agent.
  * Off-device Storage.
According to [51] DRM Content is inherently secure, and may be stored by users
off-device - for example in a network store, a PC, on removable media or
similar. This may be used for backup purposes, to free up memory in a device,
and so on. Similarly, Rights Objects that only contain stateless permissions
may be stored off-device.

##### 5.1.3.2.2 Mobile Broadcast (BCAST)
##### 5.1.3.2.2.1 3GPP {#gpp-6 .H6}
According to [18] the MBMS is an unidirectional point to multipoint bearer
service in which data is transmitted from a single source entity to multiple
recipients.
MBMS also enables an IMS application located on an application server to send
multimedia to a set of IMS users in the service area by means of MBMS bearer
service.
3GPP has defined two modes of operation [52]:
  * **The broadcast mode:** unidirectional point-to-multipoint > transmission of multimedia data (e.g. text, audio, picture, video) > from a single source entity to all users in a broadcast service > area.
  * The multicast mode: allows the unidirectional point-to-multipoint > transmission of multimedia data (e.g. text, audio, picture, video) > from a single source point to a multicast group in a multicast > service area.
In [53] the following requirements on an application level are listed:
  * Service classes:\ > In case of roaming a user shall be able to enjoy services as > follows:
\- A user shall be able to activate services that are provided locally in the
visited network, as allowed by the user\'s home environment (e.g. local
tourist information).
\- A user subscribed to a service class in the HPLMN shall be able to enjoy
equivalent services in the same service class as provided by a visited PLMN
without explicit subscription in the VPLMN (e.g. weather forecast).
\- A user subscribed to a service class in the HPLMN shall be able to have
access to home contents provided via a visited PLMN without explicit
subscription in the VPLMN (e.g. enjoy subscribed service while roaming).
  * Service Interworking:
\- The user shall be able to manipulate content delivered over MBMS and
forward it using other services (e.g. MMS, Speech Call- and IMS signalling,
Hyperlinks, etc.).
**\- When interacting with user profiles, MBMS User Services shall use the
mechanisms described in [54] (Generic User Profile).**
  * Content storage in the UE:
\- It shall be possible for the UE to store content delivered to it over MBMS
and provide it to the user at a later time.
  * Data formats and types:
\- Media types shall be supported independent of specific data types and
formats.
As a minimum MBMS User Services shall support the following media types:
\- Text.
It shall be possible to embed hyperlinks and to decorate text within content
provided by MBMS User Services.
\- Still Images.
\- Video.
\- Speech.
\- Mono/Stereo Audio.
Data formats and types used by other multimedia services shall be supported
for interoperability reasons.
  * Digital Rights Management:
\- The MBMS User Service shall be able to control content distribution and
MBMS content providers shall be able to invoke DRM to prevent unauthorized
copying and forwarding of content.
  * Notification of required capabilities:
\- The capabilities (e.g. memory size) required to receive a particular
transmission shall be notified in advance by the network or service centre.
[53] defines the following user service requirements for MBMS:
  * Charging:
\- The MBMS User Service shall support standardized mechanisms to transfer
charging related information.
  * Charging on a subscription basis.
  * Charging for keys that that allow the user access to the data.
\- It shall be possible to charge for MBMS content the user receives while
roaming in a VPLMN.
\- Some services will require an indication that MBMS content has been
received. Therefore it shall be possible for the UE to provide such an
indication.
  * Security:
\- Any user modifiable MBMS service data (e.g. storage of deliveries in the
UE, data type and format specific behaviours etc) shall only be modified by
the authenticated user.
  * Privacy:
\- Third parties and VASP should not be aware about user IDs for MBMS
subscriptions unless explicitly allowed by the operator.
  * Quality of Service:
\- It should be possible for the operator to collect statistical data such as
lost frames, assigned resources, bit-rates achieved, etc.
\- It shall be possible for the operator to adapt the distribution of a MBMS
user service consisting of different MBMS transport services to provide
multiple QoS levels according to the QoS resources provided by the access
network(s).
\- It shall be possible to base the adaptation of the distribution of a MBMS
user service to the QoS resources provided by the access network(s) on:
  * the QoS resources within the same access network (e.g. UTRAN).
  * the QoS resources provided by different access networks (e.g. UTRAN > and GERAN).
\- It shall be possible to adapt the distribution of an ongoing MBMS user
service to persistently changed QoS resource conditions in the access
network(s).
\- Adaptation of the distribution of a MBMS user service to the QoS resources
in different access networks or parts of the same access network shall not
affect the QoS of the MBMS user service in other access networks or other
parts of the same access network.
  * Subscription:
\- During the lifetime of subscription to a Multicast Service it shall be
possible for the user to declare the service preferences. It shall be possible
for the network to store the user settings.
  * Availability:
\- The user should be able to receive MBMS user services via generic IP access
systems.
##### 5.1.3.2.2.2 OMA {#oma-8 .H6}
**The term \"Mobile Broadcast\" in [76] refers to a broad range of Broadcast
Services,**
  * **which jointly leverage:**
\- the unidirectional one-to-many broadcast paradigm; and
\- the bi-directional unicast paradigm in a mobile environment; and
  * covers one-to-many services ranging from classical broadcast to > mobile multicast.
The Mobile Broadcast Services Enabler addresses functional areas:
  * which are generic enough to be common to many Broadcast Services:
\- Service Guide;
\- File Distribution;
\- Stream Distribution;
\- Service Protection;
\- Content Protection;
\- Service Interaction;
\- Service Provisioning;
\- Terminal Provisioning; and
\- Notification.
  * and which can be defined and implemented in a bearer-independent > way.
In [76] all technologies proposed upon which this enabler is specified are:
  * either based on open standards; or
  * will become part of an open standard.
The purpose of the top-level BCAST architecture [76]:
  * It puts the BCAST Enabler in the context of underlying Broadcast > Distribution Systems (BDS), service operation and content > provisioning.
  * It defines the logical entities and their relations.
Figure 5.1.3.2.2.2.1 gives an idea of the functions and the protocol stack of
OMA\'s BCAST.

Figure 5.1.3.2.2.2.1: OMA\'s BCAST functions and protocol stack [76]
Figure 5.1.3.2.2.2.1 shows the OMA BCAST functions and with what protocol
stack they would generally be realized. Such protocols may include:
  * 3GPP MBMS protocols; or
  * 3GPP2 BCMCS.
The lower layers include one-way and two-way directional bearers; hence the
BCAST enabler functions might behave differently with different types of
bearers.
The BCAST enabler architecture involves the following collection of logical
entities over a set of reference points:
  * Service Guide.
  * Streaming Distribution.
  * File Distribution.
  * Service Protection.
  * Content Protection.
  * Service Provisioning.
  * Terminal Provisioning.
  * Interaction and Notification functions.
These functions are located in the different BCAST logical entities shown in

##### 5.1.3.2.3 Dynamic Content Delivery (DCD)
##### 5.1.3.2.3.1 OMA {#oma-9 .H6}
The Dynamic Content Delivery (DCD) Enabler [77] is expected to enhance a
mobile user\'s experience through the periodic delivery of personalized or
customized content to a device. The content may be based on the subscription
and preferences of the user, operator or service provider. It is intended to
be a complementary delivery mechanism to the existing mechanisms (e.g.
browsing, messaging, etc.) and provide the added benefits of:
  * delivery control management; and
  * an enhanced user experience.
The following figure describes the overall system of the DCD Enabler.
{width="6.605555555555555in" height="3.3854166666666665in"}
Figure 5.1.3.2.3.1.1: OMA\'s DCD overall picture [77]
DCD-Enabled Client Application: receives the content from a network server for
rendering on the mobile device. This application enables the user:
  * to interact with the content;
  * initiate requests for more detailed content;
  * subscribe to additional content channels; and
  * launch other applications.
The DCD Client: acts as an agent that enables the DCD functionality on the
handset and serves one or more DCD-Enabled Client Application(s).
The DCD Enabler enables an application and its delivery to be enhanced by
making it available asynchronously and through automatic means. By way of
example, with a service based on DCD, users may subscribe to services that:
  * provide continually updated news;
  * weather;
  * traffic; or
  * financial information, all of which could be personalized for the > user.
These services could be tied to a user\'s location in order to increase the
value of the content to the user. Such a service may support delivery of the
DCD Content to the user no matter which mobile device is used through
awareness of the user\'s identity, e.g. such as that stored on a smart card.
According to [77] the DCD Enabler\'s primarily responsibilities are for
establishment and management of arrangements for periodic / on-demand content
delivery between a DCD Server and a DCD-Enabled Client Application. These
responsibilities integrate with, but are not limited to, the key functions of:
  * Content (channel) selection / subscription;
  * Content personalization and customization;
  * Content storage management;
  * Content charging.
The scope of personalization and customization for the DCD Enabler [78]
includes the ability to control specific DCD Enabler functions based upon user
profile attributes. The user profile attributes are determined from external
enablers (e.g. presence and location), or managed by the DCD Enabler as data
specifically related to DCD operation. Those specifically related to DCD
operation include:
  * statically applicable preferences which can be used for service > customization;
  * dynamically applicable preferences (based upon dynamically > determined user profile attributes), usable for service > personalization.
The following preferences are defined in [78], derived from the requirements
in [77]:
  * Per-channel static preferences:
\- Subscription: whether the user is given access to this channel, which
includes filtering of channels in the broadcast case.
\- Delivery schedule: TTL setting for content items that are periodically
updated, time-to-refresh, time of day, etc.
\- Storage space usage: minimum / maximum content storage space for the
channel.
\- Manual suspension: whether delivery for the channel is currently manually
suspended.
\- Automatic suspension schedule: day / time-of-day during which content
delivery is suspended.
  * Per-channel dynamic preferences:
\- Deliver when roaming: this conditions delivery (i.e. deliver or do not
deliver) upon the user\'s roaming status.
\- Deliver based upon current location: this conditions delivery upon the
user\'s location being inside a perimeter.
\- Deliver based upon Presence attribute: this conditions delivery upon the
value of a specific attribute value provided by a Presence Service.
Application Profile Handling allows the DCD Client to handle the delivery of
the DCD Content for a particular DCDâ€‘Enabled Client Application according to
its Application Profile. The Application Profile and its Channel Metadata
include, but are not limited to, the following elements:
  * Application-ID: identifies the type of application, as a unique > identifier for the purpose of interoperability and content > routing.
  * Content Packaging Format: e.g. ATOM, RSS, CDF, etc.
  * Channel Management Attributes: allow the DCD Client to handle the > channels in the way appropriate for this application.
  * Content Storage Management Attributes: allow this type of > applications to request specific content storage options or > actions provided by the content storage of DCD Client, e.g.:
\- Content storage allocation and reservation in DCD Client.
\- Content retention policies in the content storage of DCD Client.
  * Content Category / Type (e.g. MIME Type(s) or arbitrary string like > \"rss/finance/stock-quotes\") to identify the types of content > requested in this channel.
Data Handling and Delivery Rules - specify the static definitions and rules
for representing the channel and delivering the channel content to the
application, e.g. DCD Content and the Content Metadata / Schema for this
channel.
#### 5.1.3.3 IMS Application Servers
##### 5.1.3.3.1 3GPP/3GPP2
Application servers (AS) host and execute services, and interface with the
S-CSCF using SIP. This allows third party providers an easy integration and
deployment of their value added services to the IMS infrastructure. Examples
of services are:
  * Caller ID related services > (CLIP, CLIR, etc.).
  * Call waiting, Call > holding, Push to > talk.
  * Call forwarding, > Call transfer.
  * Call blocking services, Malicious Caller > Identification.
  * Lawful > interception.
  * Announcement services.
  * Conference call > services.
  * Voicemail, > Text-to-speech, > Speech-to-text.
  * Location based > services.
  * SMS, > MMS.
  * Presence > information, > Instant > messaging.
Depending on the actual service, the AS can operate in SIP proxy mode, SIP US
(user agent) mode or SIP B2BUA (back-to-back user agent) mode. An AS can be
located in the home network or in an external third-party network. If located
in the home network, it can query the HSS with the DIAMETER Sh interface (for
SIP-AS and OSA-SCS) or the MAP interface (for IM-SSF) [56].
  * SIP AS: native IMS application server.
  * OSA-SCS an Open Service Access - Service Capability Server > interfaces with > OSA > Application Servers using > Parlay.
  * IM-SSF: an IP Multimedia Service Switching Function interfaces with > CAMEL > Application Servers using > CAP.
The architecture is based on the principle that the service control for Home
subscribed services for a roaming subscriber is in the Home network (e.g. the
Servingâ€‘CSCF is located in the Home network).
There are two possible scenarios to provide services (see figure 5.1.3.3.1.1):
  * via the service platform in the Home Network;
  * via an external service platform.
The external service platform entity could be located in either the visited
network or in the 3^rd^ party platform. The standardized way for secure 3rd
party access to IMS services is via the OSA framework as described in [56].
{width="6.690972222222222in" height="4.647916666666666in"}
Figure 5.1.3.3.1.1: Locations of service platforms
An Application Server (AS) offering value added IM services resides either in
the user\'s home network or in a third party location. The third party could
be a network or simply a stand-alone AS.
The Servingâ€‘CSCF to AS interface is used to provide services residing in an
AS. Two cases were identified:
  * Servingâ€‘CSCF to an AS in Home Network.
  * Servingâ€‘CSCF to an AS in External Network (e.g. Third Party or > Visited).
The SIP Application Server may host and execute services. The SIP Application
Server can influence and impact the SIP session on behalf of the services and
it uses the ISC interface to communicate with the Sâ€‘CSCF.
The ISC interface shall be able support subscription to event notifications
between the Application Server and Sâ€‘CSCF to allow the Application Server to
be notified of the implicit registered Public User Identities, registration
state and UE capabilities and characteristics in terms of SIP User Agent
capabilities and characteristics.
The Sâ€‘CSCF shall decide whether an Application Server is required to receive
information related to an incoming initial SIP request to ensure appropriate
service handling. The decision at the Sâ€‘CSCF is based on (filter) information
received from the HSS. This filter information is stored and conveyed on a per
Application Server basis for each user. The name(s)/address(es) information of
the Application Server (s) are received from the HSS.
From the perspective of the Sâ€‘CSCF, The \"SIP Application server\", \"OSA
service capability server\" and \"IM-SSF\" shall exhibit the same interface
behaviour.
When the name/address of more than one Application Server is transferred from
the HSS, the Sâ€‘CSCF shall contact the Application Servers in the order
supplied by the HSS. The response from the first Application Server shall be
used as the input to the second Application Server. Note that these multiple
Application Servers may be any combination of the SIP Application server, OSA
service capability server, or IM-SSF types.
The Sâ€‘CSCF does not provide authentication and security functionality for
secure direct third party access to the IM subsystem. The OSA framework
provides a standardized way for third party secure access to the IM subsystem.
If a Sâ€‘CSCF receives a SIP request on the ISC interface that was originated by
an Application Server destined to a user served by that Sâ€‘CSCF, then the
Sâ€‘CSCF shall treat the request as a terminating request to that user and
provide the terminating request functionality as described above. Both
registered and unregistered terminating requests shall be supported.
It shall be possible for an Application Server to generate SIP requests and
dialogs on behalf of users. Such requests are forwarded to the Sâ€‘CSCF serving
the user, and the Sâ€‘CSCF shall perform regular originating procedures for
these requests.
Originating requests on behalf of registered and unregistered users shall be
supported.
The Application Server (SIP Application Server and/or the OSA service
capability server and/or IM-SSF) may communicate to the HSS. The S~h~ and S~i~
interfaces are used for this purpose.
For the S~h~ interface, the following shall apply:
1) The S~h~ interface is an intra-operator interface.
2) The S~h~ interface is between the HSS and the \"SIP Application Server\"
and between the HSS and the \"OSA service capability server\". The HSS is
responsible for policing what information will be provided to each individual
Application Server.
3) The S~h~ interface transports transparent data for e.g. service related
data, user related information, etc.\ In this case, the term transparent
implies that the exact representation of the information is not understood by
the HSS or the protocol.
4) The S~h~ interface also supports mechanisms for transfer of user related
data stored in the HSS (e.g. user service related data, MSISDN, visited
network capabilities, user location (cell global ID/SAI or the address of the
serving network element, etc.)).
Before providing information relating to the location of the user to a SIP
Application Server, detailed privacy checks frequently need to be performed.
The SIP Application Server can ensure that these privacy requirements are met
by using the L~e~ interface to the GMLC instead of using the S~h~ interface.
5) The S~h~ interface also supports mechanisms for transfer of standardized
data, e.g. for group lists, which can be accessed by different Application
Servers. Those Application Servers sharing the data shall understand the data
format. This enables sharing of common information between Application
Servers, e.g. data managed via the Ut reference point.
The S~i~ interface is between the HSS and the IM-SSF. It transports CAMEL
subscription information including triggers for use by CAMEL based application
services.
According to [56] users are identified in the following way:
  * Private User Identities: Every IM CN subsystem user shall have one > or more Private User Identities assigned by the home network > operator (used e.g. for Registration, Authorization, > Administration, and Accounting purposes). This identity shall take > the form of a Network Access Identifier (NAI) as defined in > RFC 2486 [106]. It is possible for a representation of the IMSI > to be contained within the NAI for the private identity.
\- The Private User Identity is not used for routing of SIP messages.
\- The Private User Identity shall be contained in all Registration requests
passed from the UE to the home network.
\- An ISIM application shall securely store one Private User Identity. It
shall not be possible for the UE to modify the Private User Identity
information stored on the ISIM application.
\- The Private User Identity is a unique global identity defined by the Home
Network Operator, which may be used within the home network to identify the
user\'s subscription (e.g. IM service capability) from a network perspective.
The Private User Identity identifies the subscription, not the user.
\- The Private User Identity shall be permanently allocated to a user\'s
subscription (it is not a dynamic identity), and is valid for the duration of
the user\'s subscription with the home network.
\- The Private User Identity is used to identify the user\'s information (for
example authentication information) stored within the HSS (for use for example
during Registration).
\- The Private User Identity may be present in charging records based on
operator policies.
\- The Private User Identity is authenticated only during registration of the
user, (including re-registration and de-registration).
\- The HSS needs to store the Private User Identity.
\- The Sâ€‘CSCF needs to obtain and store the Private User Identity upon
registration and unregistered termination.
  * Every IM CN subsystem user shall have one or more Public User > Identities (see 3GPP TS 22.228 [107]). The Public User > Identity/identities are used by any user for requesting > communications to other users.
\- Both telecom numbering and Internet naming schemes can be used to address
users depending on the Public User identities that the users have.
\- The Public User Identity/identities shall take the form of a SIP URI (as
defined in RFC 3261 and RFC 2396) or the \"tel:\"-URI format RFC 3966 [108].
\- An ISIM application shall securely store at least one Public User Identity
(it shall not be possible for the UE to modify the Public User Identity), but
it is not required that all additional Public User Identities be stored on the
ISIM application.
\- A Public User Identity shall be registered either explicitly or implicitly
before originating IMS sessions and originating IMS session unrelated
procedures can be established by a UE using the Public User Identity.
\- It shall be possible to identify Public User Identities of a user that are
linked to the same service profile and have the exact same service
configuration for each and every service (i.e. \"alias\" Public User
Identities). For such a group of Public User Identities, operations that
enable changes to the service profile shall apply to all the Public User
Identities within the group. This grouping information shall be made available
to the HSS, AS, and UE. The information about the Public User Identities of
the users that are linked to the same service profile shall be able to be
provisioned in the HSS. It shall be possible to make this information
available to the AS via the S~h~ interface, and that S~h~ operations are
applicable to all of the IMPUs within the same service profile. It shall be
possible to make this information available to the UE via the G~m~ interface.
\- A Public User Identity shall be registered either explicitly or implicitly
before terminating IMS sessions and terminating IMS session unrelated
procedures can be delivered to the UE of the user that the Public User
Identity belongs to.
\- It shall be possible to register globally (i.e. through one single UE
request) a user that has more than one public identity via a mechanism within
the IP multimedia CN subsystem (e.g. by using an Implicit Registration Set).
This shall not preclude the user from registering individually some of his/her
public identities if needed.
\- Public User Identities are not authenticated by the network during
registration.
\- Public User Identities may be used to identify the user\'s information
within the HSS (for example, during mobile terminated session set-up).
IMS group management concepts:
  * The U~t~ reference point is used to manage groups from the UE. This > does not preclude the use of other mechanisms for group > management, e.g. using OSA or OA&M mechanisms.
  * The U~t~ reference point shall support a scenario where one single > Application Server (sometimes referred to as a Group and List > Management Server - GLMS) is used to create groups that can be > utilized for different services, possibly hosted by different > ASes.
  * Each group shall be addressable by a globally unique group > identifier. The group identifier shall take the form of a Public > Service Identifier.
##### 5.1.3.3.2 OMA
The IMS Service Provisioning Architecture standardized by 3GPP/3GPP2, allows
applications to access capabilities of the IMS. It provides two options for
service provisioning, namely SIP-Application Server and OSA Gateway. IMS
provides service-enabling functions and IP transport and is therefore relevant
to the OMA Service Environment (OSE).
Applications may use OMA enablers or may use IMS functions directly or both.
In the OSE, OMA enabler implementations may make use of IMS capabilities, e.g.
charging, authentication, service management, etc. IMS related
applications/enablers can use OSE capabilities in addition to IMS
capabilities.
The only IMS interfaces an OMA enabler may use are the following:
  * ISC interface: The ISC interface is between the enabler server > implementation and the IMS core. The ISC interface provides the > OMA service enabler with SIP/SDP call control, SIP event related > subscription and notification, SIP messaging, etc.
  * S~h~ interface: The S~h~ interface is between the enabler server > implementation and HSS in the IMS core. The S~h~ interface > provides the OMA service enabler with read and write operations of > user data related to IMS. It also provides with functionality for > subscription and notification of changes in the user data related > to IMS. The protocol used on the S~h~ interface is DIAMETER.
  * D~h~ interface: The D~h~ interface is between the enabler server > implementation and the Service Locator Function (SLF) in IMS core. > The D~h~ interface is quite similar to the Sh interface and is > used by the enabler implementations to get the address of the HSS > that handles a particular user in networks, where there are > several HSS. The protocol used on the D~h~ interface is DIAMETER.
  * U~t~ interface: The U~t~ interface is between the enabler > implementation in the terminal and the enabler server > implementation. The U~t~ interface provides the UE with a set of > operations that allow configuring user specific data in the OMA > service enabler servers. The user specific data comprises, but it > is not restricted to configuration management, such as > configuration of presence lists and presence authorization rules. > The protocol used on the U~t~ interface is being specified in 3GPP > and is based on XCAP.
  * R~o~ interface: The R~o~ interface provides the OMA service enabler > with an event based charging interface to the online charging > system in the IMS core. The protocol used on the Ro interface is > DIAMETER.
  * R~f~ interface: The R~f~ interface provides the OMA service enabler > with an interface to the off-line charging system in the IMS core. > The protocol used on the R~f~ interface is DIAMETER.
  * G~m~ interface: The G~m~ interface is between the enabler > implementation in the terminal and the IMS core. The G~m~ > interface provides the OMA service enabler with SIP/SDP call > control, SIP event related subscription and notification, SIP > messaging, etc.
  * M~b~ interface: The M~b~ interface provides the OMA service enabler > with user plane packet media streams over IP via the IMS core.
In order to be able to utilize services built on IMS the enabler terminal
implementation (ETI\~UE) shall support the following main features in addition
to SIP:
  * AKA authentication within REGISTER;
  * security mechanism agreement for SIP within REGISTER;
  * IPsec based on AKA and on the security mechanism agreement for SIP.
In order to connect an enabler server implementation (ESI\~AS) to IMS to offer
services the ESI shall support the following main features in addition to SIP:
  * charging using the received information from IMS;
  * at least one of the modes: UAC, UAS and proxy;
  * two types of third party call control when acting as a B2BUA.
IMS defines and uses several private header (P-header) extensions to SIP. The
following P-headers are visible both in ETI and ESI (the corresponding terms
UE and AS are used below):
  * P-Access-Network-Info (carries information of the access network > from UE to IMS and from IMS to ASes; visible only to trusted AS).
  * P-Asserted-Identity.
  * P-Called-Party-ID (carries the target public user identity from IMS > to UE). The P-Called-Party-ID header field may be seen at the AS > when the AS is the called party (i.e. the destination of the > session), but not in other scenarios (e.g. when the AS is just a > proxy in the chain of proxies in the path towards a UE).
  * P-Charging-Vector.
  * P-Charging-Function-Addresses.
The following P-headers are visible only in UE, but not in AS:
  * P-Associated-URI (carries associated URIs to the registered Public > user identity from IMS to UE).
  * P-Media-Authorization (carries media authorization token from IMS to > UE).
  * P-Preferred-Identity (carries identity preferred by the user from UE > to IMS).
The following P-headers are visible in AS, but not in UE:
  * P-Asserted-Identity (carries valid and authenticated Public user > identity from IMS to AS).
  * P-Charging-Vector (carries charging correlation information from IMS > to AS).
  * P-Charging-Function-Addresses (carries offline and online charging > function addresses from IMS to AS).
The Home Subscriber Server is the master database for a given user. It is the
entity containing the subscription-related information to support the network
entities actually handling sessions. The HSS is responsible storing the data
for authenticating and authorizing the subscriber.
#### 5.1.3.4 Store and Forward Messaging
##### 5.1.3.4.1 Instant Messaging (IM)
##### 5.1.3.4.1.1 OMA {#oma-11 .H6}
Instant Messaging (IM) as described in [80] is a concept known in both the
mobile and desktop worlds. Desktop IM clients, two-way SMS and two-way paging
are all forms of Instant Messaging. Wireless Village IM will enable
interoperable mobile IM in concert with other innovative features to provide
an enhanced user experience.
Groups or chat are familiar concepts on the Internet. Both operators and end-
users are able to create and manage groups. Users can invite their friends and
family to chat in group discussions. Operators can build common interest
groups where end-users can meet each other online.
Shared Content allows users and operators to setup their own storage area
where they can post pictures, music and other multimedia content while
enabling the sharing with other individuals and groups in an IM or chat
session.
The following figure shows the basic architecture of the IM framework [80].

IMPS Server: central point in an IMPS system, composed of four Application
Service Elements that are accessible via the Service Access Point:
  * Presence Service Element: provides functionality for presence > information management. This includes update, retrieve, set and > store presence and location information. Presence information can > be manipulated implicitly by the system, or explicitly by the user > (for details see clause about presence).
  * Instant Messaging Service Element: provides functionality for > sending and receiving instant messages. An instant message may be > sent to, or received from, a specific IMPS-user, or users of other > instant messaging systems. It is also possible to send instant > messages to a group of IMPS-users. IMPS supports several message > types such as plain text, video, picture and sound.
  * Group Service Element: provides functionality for use and management > of groups. The groups can be private or public. A common usage of > the Group Service is a chat room. It is also possible to bind > content to the Groups.
  * Content Service Element: provides functionality for sharing content > such as images and documents between IMPS users. This allows the > IMPS users to share content while sending messages or chatting in > a group. In this IMPS enabler, the shared content is realized by > allowing a user to send a URL of the content he or she is willing > to share. There are no mechanisms to upload or download content.
Service Access Point (SAP): serves as the interface between the IMPS server
and its environment. It has interfaces to the IMPS clients, other IMPS
servers, the Mobile Core Network and Proprietary Gateways to non-IMPS servers.
The functionality of the Service Access Point is:
  * Authentication and Authorization: Authentication is used to verify > the identity of an entity (user, network, or application). > Authorization is the activity of determining what an authenticated > entity (user, network, or application) is allowed to do. There are > several types of mechanisms for authentication and authorization:
\- Application-Network Authentication / Authorization.
\- User-Application Authentication / Authorization.
\- Application-Application Authentication / Authorization.
\- User-Network Authentication (only for Authentication).
  * Service Discovery and Service Agreement: Service Discovery enables > the application to identify the collection of service capability > features that it can use. The service discovery process includes > service capability registration and service capability > notification. This is done both between Client - Server and Server > -Server. A Service Agreement (also known as a Service negotiation) > must be established before the server can interact with the > Network Service Capability or other servers\' service > capabilities, and provides the client with the services.
  * User Profile Management: One or more User Profile(s) describe(s) how > the user wishes to manage and interact with their communication > services (Figure below). The User Profile information consists of > various user interfaces and service related information including > the list of services to which the end-user is subscribed, > preferences associated with those services, service status (active > / inactive), privacy status with regards to network service > capabilities (e.g. user location, user interaction), terminal > capabilities and terminal interface preferences etc. User Profile > Management allows the application to retrieve and update the user > profile.

Figure 5.1.3.4.1.1.2: OMA\'s IM User Profile Management [80]
  * Service Relay: The Service Access Point must provide the Service Relay function to route all service requests and responses among the servers using the Server-to-Server Protocol (SSP). The Service Relay requires that the SAP performs CSP to SSP conversion and may have to transcode the contents of a service request and response.
#### 5.1.3.5 P2P and Group Communication
##### 5.1.3.5.1 Push To Talk Over Cellular (PoC)
##### 5.1.3.5.1.1 3GPP {#gpp-7 .H6}
According to [57] it is assumed that the PoC architecture makes use of the
following IMS capabilities in the 3GPP system:
  * Registration;
  * IMS routing capabilities, including discovery and address > resolution;
  * IMS security including authentication and authorization;
  * IMS charging;
  * SIP compression;
  * IMS group management;
  * Public service identities;
  * Presence Service.
PoC as a service is introduced as an application within the frame of the IP
Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). Figure 5.1.3.5.1.1.1 illustrates how the PoC
service elements fit into the IMS architecture.
{width="5.342361111111111in" height="3.4444444444444446in"}
Figure 5.1.3.5.1.1.1: 3GPP\'s PoC Architecture [57]
The PoC server implementing the application level network functionality for
the PoC service is essentially seen as an Application Server from the IMS
perspective. Consequently, communications between the IMS core and the PoC
server utilize the ISC interface defined in TS 23.228 [56].
The XML Document Management Server (XDMS) is used by the PoC users to manage
groups and lists (e.g. contact and access lists) that are needed for the PoC
service. In the IMS architecture, the Ut interface provides these functions,
hence communications between the XDMS and the UE utilize the Ut interface.
A Presence Server may provide availability information about PoC users to
other PoC users.
##### 5.1.3.5.1.2 OMA {#oma-12 .H6}
Push to talk over Cellular (PoC) provides rapid communications for business
and consumer customers of mobile networks. PoC allows user voice and data
communications shared with a single recipient, (1-to-1) or between groups of
recipients as in a group chat session (1-to-many).
OMA-PoC seeks interoperability among the network entities to avoid market
fragmentation, by realizing the PoC service in a widely acceptable and
standardized manner. The figure below describes the functional entities and
reference points that are involved in the support of the PoC service.
{width="6.333333333333333in" height="5.447916666666667in"}
Figure 5.1.3.5.1.2.1: OMA\'s PoC Architecture [81]
The POC-1 reference point supports the communication between the PoC Client
and the SIP/IP Core using SIP.
This reference point shall support the following:
  * PoC Session signalling between the PoC Client and the PoC Server.
  * Provides discovery and address resolution services.
  * Provides SIP compression.
  * Performs authentication and authorization of the PoC User at the PoC > Client based on the PoC User\'s service profile.
  * Provides PoC Client registration.
  * Indication of capabilities for PoC.
  * Relaying PoC Service Settings (Answer Mode Indication, Incoming PoC > Session Barring, Incoming Instant Personal Alert Barring, and > Simultaneous PoC Sessions Support) to the PoC Server.
  * Provides the integrity protection and optionally the confidentiality > protection of the PoC Session signalling.
The POC-5 reference point supports communication between the Shared XDMS and
the PoC Server using XCAP.
The POC-5 reference point provides the following functions:
  * Retrieval of URI Lists from the Shared XDMS.
The POC-6 reference point supports communication between the PoC XDM Server
and the SIP/IP Core. The protocol for the POC-6 reference point is SIP.
The POC-6 reference point provides the following functions:
  * Subscription to the modification of PoC-specific XML documents.
  * Notification of the modification of PoC-specific XML documents.
The POC-7 reference point supports communication between the Aggregation Proxy
and the PoC XDM Server using XCAP.
The POC-7 reference point provides the following functions:
  * PoC-specific XML document management (e.g. create, modify, retrieve, > delete).
**Identification**
  * PoC Address: Each PoC User shall have one or more PoC Addresses > either in the format of a SIP URI or a TEL URI. At least one PoC > Address has to be in the format of a SIP URI. The PoC Address > SHALL comply either with the specification of a SIP URI, or with > the specification of a TEL URI.
Examples of PoC Addresses are:
\- sip:joe.doe\@operator.net;
\- sip:buss2.city\@operator.net;
\- sip:buss2.city\@poc.operator.net;
\- tel:+16195551212;
\- tel:5551212; phone-context = pbx.net.
  * Private User identity: When the SIP/IP Core corresponds with > 3GPP/3GPP2 IMS, the private User identity shall be used as > described above.
  * PoC Group Identities: A PoC Group is identified with a PoC Group > Identity. The PoC Client uses PoC Group Identities for addressing > PoC Group Sessions. The PoC Group Identity is associated with > individual PoC Addresses of all the PoC Group members. The PoC > Group Identity shall take the form of SIP URI.
\- An operator shall be able to create a static Group identity which is stored
in the PoC XDMS for use in PoC Group Sessions.
\- A PoC User shall be able to create a PoC Group which is stored in the PoC
XDMS for use in PoC Group Sessions.
\- The PoC User shall be able to create and store a Group List in the Shared
XDMS as a URI list.
**Addressing**
  * Phone numbers: maybe used as a user public identity. A PoC User may > address another PoC User by a phone number. The PoC Client shall > send the phone number to the SIP/IP Core in a TEL URI.
The phone number MAY use the international E.164] format (prefixed with a
\'+\' sign), or a local format. The SIP Core shall interpret the phone number
with a leading \'+\' to be an E.164 number.
  * SIP URI: A PoC User may address another PoC User, Pre-arranged PoC > Groups and Chat PoC Groups by a SIP URI.
**Identification of inviting PoC User**
The PoC Server shall maintain the PoC Address of the inviting PoC User used in
the originating request (SIP URI, TEL URI, Nick Name or combination SIP URI +
Nick Name). The PoC Server shall identify the Groups by SIP URI and MAY
identify them by Nick Name.
In the case of a PoC Group Session the PoC Server shall provide the PoC Group
Identity to the invited PoC Client(s).
The home PoC Server shall replace the Nick Name provided by the inviting PoC
Client, if the Nick Name is configured in the home PoC Server of the inviting
PoC User.
**Talker Identification**
To provide the PoC Address and Nick Name of the Participant who has been
permitted to send a Talk Burst to all listening Participants in the PoC
Session the PoC Server shall support Talker Identification.
**Registration**
General
Prior to using the PoC service the UE hosting the PoC Client shall perform SIP
registration to the SIP/IP Core, which indicates the support of PoC service in
the REGISTER request. The registration function is provided in the SIP/IP Core
and the registration/deregistration may be visible to the PoC Server via the
POC-2 reference point. After a successful registration a PoC User is able to
use a registered PoC Address:
  * to originate PoC communication including session and session > unrelated procedures;
  * to receive PoC communication including session and session unrelated > procedures.
When the SIP/IP Core corresponds with 3GPP/3GPP2 IMS then it is possible for
the network on behalf of PoC UE to register additional PoC Addresses during a
SIP registration of a single PoC Address. Registering multiple PoC Addresses
at once is called implicit registration. The PoC Address that is used in the
registration shall be SIP URI while the PoC Addresses to be registered
implicitly may be SIP URIs or TEL URIs.
#### 5.1.3.6 Data Synchronization
##### 5.1.3.6.1 OMA
With the emergence of mobile computing and communications devices, users have
access to their personal or professional information and applications, from
multiple places (home, work, travel, etc.) and devices (mobile phones, PDA,
computers, network, etc.). As the information they want may not always be on
the device they carry, and they cannot be permanently connected to network to
access their data, the OMA DS Enabler [82] provides a common data
synchronization framework and XML-based format, or representation protocol,
for synchronizing data on networked devices. The OMA DS Enabler is designed
for use between mobile devices that are intermittently connected to the
network and network services that are continuously available on the network.
The OMA DS Enabler is specifically designed to handle the case where the
network services and the device store the data they are synchronizing in
different formats or use different software systems.

Figure 5.1.3.6.1.1: OMA\'s DS Architecture [82]
Functional entities:
  * Data Sync Client: entity that contains a synchronization client > agent and that usually sends the data synchronization commands, > possibly including payload data to the Data Sync Server. It shall > also be able to receive responses from the Data Sync Server and to > receive some data synchronization commands from the server side.
  * Data Sync Server: entity that contains a synchronization server > agent and synchronization engine and which usually receives the > data synchronization messages (operations) possibly including > payload data from the Data Sync Client. The Data Sync Server shall > also be able to send the responses to the commands if needed and > to send some data synchronization messages as commands to the > client.
  * Notification Enabler: entity used for notification. The Data Sync > Server or other applications can use this notification capability > to cause the Data Sync Client to initiate a connection to the Data > Sync Server.
  * Provisioning Enabler: entity used to provision synchronization > settings for data sync client.
  * Client and Server Data Storage: used for storing data relevant to > data synchronization, such as emails, contacts, calendars, short > messages, etc.
  * Device Info Storage: used as an optional external storage for device > information.
Interfaces:
  * Interface DS-1: Data Sync Client - Data Sync Server: used for the > Data Sync Client and the Data Sync Server to interact with each > other for data synchronization. This interface is > transport-independent. Hence the transportcan be HTTP, OBEX, etc.
  * Interface DS-2: Provisioning Enabler - Data Sync Client: used to > provision synchronization settings for the data sync client.
  * Interface DS-3: Notification Enabler - Data Sync Client: used to > notify the data sync client to cause the Data Sync Client to > initiate a connection to the Data Sync Server.
  * Interface DS-4: Data Sync Client/Server - Device Info Storage: used > for the Data Sync Client or Server to retrieve the other side\'s > device information.
  * Interface Ext: Data Sync Client/Server - Data Storage: used for the > Data Sync Client or Server to access Data Storage, such as email > data storage, calendar data storage, or contact data storage. This > interface is not defined in the OMA DS Enabler.
##### 5.1.3.7 Gaming Service
##### 5.1.3.7.1 3GPP {#gpp-8 .H6}
The purpose of [58] is to help 3GPP TSG RAN WG2 define, describe and improve
the support for gaming using HSDPA/HSUPA (HS-DSCH/E-DCH), focusing on
minimizing delay and the service interruption time in case of handover. The
latency of radio, core network, and terminals should be included in the
present document with evaluations of the various complexity issues affecting
both real time gaming (such as RT Shooting and RT auto racing) and less than
real time gaming (such as chess and other less demanding gaming). Inclusion of
2 way RT gaming plus 2 way synchronized voice should also be included in the
present document. All evaluations shall include complexity analysis and any
end-user complexities and relevant issues.
HSDPA and HSUPA are very important features for operators to carry efficient
multimedia services in conjunction with IMS. Gaming is an increasingly
important application that requires better performance to satisfy the user
expectation. There is a need to enhance the support for gaming, e.g. to focus
on minimizing of delay and the service interruption time in case of handover.
##### 5.1.3.7.2 OMA {#oma-14 .H6}
When looking at mobile games, both from a game experience and architecture
perspective, it is useful to distinguish between the following categories of
games [83]:
  * Messaging based games, which are games using SMS or MMS messaging > protocols, and have their game logic purely on the server. Such > games can only be played when users are connected to the mobile > network.
  * Mobile browser-based games, using for example a WAP or I-mode > browser, also follow the thin client approach as described above.
  * Downloadable offline games, where game logic is downloaded on the > mobile device and is executing on the mobile device only.
  * Downloadable online games, where game logic is downloaded and > executed on the device, but here in conjunction with a game server > that can be accessed over a wireless network.
  * Externally delivered games, which are distributed physically, > through various media (e.g. memory cards etc) and are executing on > the mobile device in conjunction with a game server that is > accessed over a wireless network.
In the context of mobile game service, OMA Game Service generally consists of
game server and IMS service capability. The game server provides an interface
to the game logic, and an interface to the game client, where both client and
server store and update the game state according to the game logic. The IMS
service capability provides necessary functions to offer a completeness of
multi-player online game that is either within or beyond OMA standardization.
Figure 5.1.3.7.2.1 depicts the context model for OMA gaming support.
{width="6.180555555555555in" height="3.2743055555555554in"}
Figure 5.1.3.7.2.1: OMA\'s context model for gaming [83]
A domain model has been defined as shown in the figure below.
  * DMR-1 represents the relationship between Application and > ApplicationInstance. It is one-to-many relationship.
  * DMR-2 represents the relationship between ApplicationInstance and > ActorSession. It is one-to-many relationship.
  * DMR-3 represents the relationship between Application and > MasterApplicationInstance. It is one-to-many relationship.
  * DMR-4 represents the relationship between Application and Actor. It > is one-to-many relationship.
  * DMR-5 represents the relationship between Actor and ActorSession. It > is one-to-many relationship.
  * DMR-6 represents the relationship between ActorSession and Session. > It is one-to-one relationship.
  * DMR-7 represents the relationship between Actor and Session. It is > one-to-many relationship.
  * DMR-8 represents the relationship between User and Actor. It is > one-to-many relationship.

#### 5.1.3.8 IN Services
##### 5.1.3.8.1 General Info
Under IN services one can understand the concentration of certain services (so
called value added services), which exceed the pure connection services and
their additional functions, within so called \"intelligent network elements\".
**Advantages:**
  * Services, which are utilized and need to be controlled network wide, > do not have to be built into every network node, but can be > provided centrally.
  * New services can be introduced into the whole network quickly and > easily.
**Prerequisites:**
  * Powerful information exchange protocol between network nodes.
  * Big central database with global network information.
Services are activated via special numbers (0800, 0900,etc.) or certain events
(e.g. the usage of a certain connection). This activates the service providing
servers in the network, which evaluate the received information and send the
result back to the transport network for the respective call set-up between
the A-party and the called (B-) party (person, call centre, server, etc.).
The signalling information is directed to the IN-node using the \"Intelligent
Network Application Protocol\" (INAP) and/or the \"CAMEL Application Part\".
So the actual communication goal, as well as tariff and routing information
can be handed over to the communication network. The figure below gives a
simplified version of the network structure, so as to be able to show where
the respective signalling protocols are used.
The service logic itself, as well as the data model belonging to it is
provider/vendor specific. INAP, CAP and CAMEL have been standardized. Of
interest for the data model of an end user will be the capability sets, which
give an idea of the service logic as well as the definition of the trigger
detection points and the camel subscription information.

##### 5.1.3.8.1.1 ITU-T {#itu-t-2 .H6}
**The Services**
According to [90] the following descriptions of the services comprising CS1
are valid:
Abbreviated Dialling (ABD)
  * This service is an originating line feature that allows business > subscribers to dial others in their company using, e.g. only four > digits even if the calling user\'s line and the called user\'s > line are served by different switches. This capability extends > switched based intercom calling beyond the switch boundary.
Account Card Calling (ACC)
  * The account card calling service allows a user to make a call from > any card reading telephone and have the charges for the call > automatically debited to a domestic or business account number as > defined by the card content.
  * The account card calling service allows subscribers to place calls > from any normal access interface to any destination number and > have the cost of those calls charged to the account specified by > the ACC number.
  * This service allows the caller to be automatically charged on a > telephone account subscribed with the network operator, for any > type of outgoing call. The caller has to dial his card number and > a PIN, then the called number.
Automatic Alternative Billing (AAB)
  * The AAB service enables a user to make a call from any telephone and > for the call charge to be billed to the user\'s account which is > specific to this service, and which does not refer either to the > calling line or to the called line.
  * This service allows a user to call another user and ask him to > receive the call at his expenses. Two steps may be defined: the > calling party is welcomed to record a brief message giving the > caller\'s name and explaining the call reason, then the called > party is alerted, receives the recorded message and is asked to > accept to be charged for that call.
Call Distribution (CD)
  * This service allows a subscriber to have incoming calls routed to > different destinations, according to an allocation law which may > be real-time managed by the subscriber.
Call Forwarding (CF)
  * Call forwarding allows the called user to forward calls to another > telephone number when this service is activated. With this > service, all calls destined to the subscriber\'s number are > redirected to the new telephone number.
This service is under control of the subscriber and can be
activated/deactivated by the subscriber.
When this service is activated, the subscriber\'s line will receive an
alerting ring, \"reminder ring\", to indicate that the service is activated.
  * This service permits the user to have his incoming calls addressed > to another number, no matter what the called party line status is. > The user\'s originating service is unaffected, even for charging.
Call Rerouting Distribution (CRD)
  * This service permits the subscriber to have his incoming calls > encountering a triggering condition (busy, specified number or > rings, queue overload or call limiter) rerouted according to a > predefined choice: the calls may be rerouted to another > destination number (including pager or vocal box), rerouted on a > standard or customized announcement, or queued.
Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
  * This service allows a calling user encountering a busy destination > to be informed when the busy destination becomes free, without > having to make a new call attempt.
Conference calling (CON)
  * Conference calling allows the connection of multiple parties in a > single conversation. The number of parties allowed to be connected > simultaneously will vary based on transmission bridging > requirements to ensure Quality of Service.
Credit Card Calling (CCC)
  * The credit card calling service allows subscribers to place calls > from any normal access interface to any destination number and > have the cost of those calls charged to the account specified by > the CCC number.
  * This service allows the caller to be automatically charged on a bank > card account, for any type of outgoing call. The caller has to > dial his card number and a PIN, then the called number.
Destination Call Routing (DCR)
  * This service allows customers to specify the routing of their calls > to destinations according to:
\- time of day, day of week, etc.;
\- area of call origination;
\- calling line identity of customer;
\- service attributes held against the customer;
\- priority (e.g. from input of a PIN);
\- charge rates applicable for the destinations;
\- proportional routing of traffic.
  * Destination call routing allows a subscriber to have incoming calls > routed to different destinations, based upon the geographic > locations of the calling parties. There are also optional reports > which provide the subscriber with data on all their incoming calls > and can include details such as date and time of call.
Follow-Me Diversion (FMD)
  * Follow-me diversion allows the service subscriber to remotely > control the redirection (diversion) of calls from his primary > telephone number to other locations. The subscriber is allowed to > update the diversion location telephone number, from a standard > telephone instrument, as he moves from location to location.
  * This service allows the subscriber to remotely control his call > forwarding capabilities, basically the number to which the calls > are forwarded, from any point in the network.
  * With this service, a user may register for incoming calls to any > terminal access. When registered, all incoming calls to the user > will be presented to this terminal access. A registration for > incoming calls will cancel any previous registration. Several > users may register for incoming calls to the same terminal access > simultaneously. The user may also explicitly deregister for > incoming calls.
Freephone (FPH)
  * This service allows a reverse charging, the subscriber accepting to > receive calls at his expenses and being charged for the whole cost > of the call.
  * Freephone allows the served user having one or several installations > to be reached from all or part of the country, or internationally > as appropriate, with a freephone number and to be charged for this > kind of call.
Malicious Call Identification (MCI)
  * Malicious call identification allows the service subscriber to > control the logging (making a record) of calls that are received > that are of a malicious nature.
  * This service enables a user to request that the source of an > incoming call is identified and registered in the network. The > following information at least is to be registered: called party > number, calling party number, time and date of the request. The > service may be invoked either during or after the active phase of > the call, but before the called user has cleared; as an option, it > may be invoked by the network on all calls that are not answered.
Mass calling (MAS)
  * Using this service, the network operator can temporarily allocate a > single directory number to the served user. Each time a call is > made to this number by an end user, the user will be played an > announcement and asked to input a further digit to indicate a > preference. The choice made will be recorded and a count > incremented. When the service has ceased, the network operator > will supply details of the total \"votes\" cast for each > preference will be supplied to the served user and the special > number will be reallocated. Calls made to this special number may > be charged at varying rates.
  * Mass calling involves instantaneous, high-volume traffic which is > routed to one or multiple destination(s). Calls can be routed to > these destination numbers based on various conditions, such as the > geographical location or time of day. The calling party will be > charged for this kind of call.
Originating Call Screening (OCS)
  * Originating calls may be controlled by the originating call > screening capability. This allows the subscriber to specify that > outgoing calls be either restricted or allowed, according to a > screening list and, optionally, by time of day control. This can > be overridden on a per-call basis by anyone with the proper > identity code.
  * This service allows a subscriber to authorize outgoing calls, > through the use of a screening list. This list may be managed by > the subscriber. The user may override the restriction by giving a > PIN.
Premium rate (PRM)
  * This service allows to pay back a part of the call cost to the > called party, considered as an added value service provider.
  * Premium rate allows the served user having one or several > installations to be reached from all or part of the country, or > internationally as appropriate, with a premium rate number. The > calling party will be charged with a premium rate for this kind of > call.
Security screening (SEC)
  * This capability allows security screening to be performed in the > network before an endâ€‘user gains access to the subscriber\'s > network, systems, or applications. Access code abuse detection is > a capability which will generate a report on the invalid access > attempts: how many, over what time period, by whom, and from > where. This provides an added layer of security.
  * This service asks the user to dial a pin code, which allows the > verification of the user identity before giving the user access to > the subscriber\'s network, systems or application. As an option, > the invalid access attempts may be registered.
Selective call forwarding on busy/don\'t answer (SCF)
  * Selective call forwarding - busy/don\'t answer (SCF-BY/DA) allows > the called user to forward particular pre-selected calls if the > called user is busy or does not answer within Y seconds or X > rings. The calls will be pre-selected based upon an SCF-BY/DA > list. This list will have 1 to 5 numbers or 1 to 10 numbers with a > default call forward number for calling users not in the list. > There will also be remote access and time of day indicators for > this capability.
Selective call forwarding
  * This service permits the user to have his incoming calls addressed > to another number, no matter what the called party line status is, > if the calling line identity is included in, or excluded from, a > screening list. The user\'s originating service is unaffected, > even for charging.
Call forwarding on busy
  * This service permits the user to have his incoming calls addressed > to another number if they encounter a busy condition. The user\'s > originating service is unaffected, even for charging.
Call forwarding on don\'t answer (no reply)
  * This service permits the user to have his incoming calls addressed > to another number, if they encounter no reply. The user\'s > originating service is unaffected, even for charging.
Split charging (SPL)
  * This service allows a split charging, the calling and the called > party being each charged for one part of the call.
  * This service enables a network operator to distribute the charges > for a call between the two parties involved.
  * Split charging allows the service user having one or several > installations to be reached from all or part of the country, or > internationally as appropriate, with a split charging number. Both > the calling party and the served user will be charged with a split > charging rate for this kind of call.
Televoting (VOT)
  * This service allows the subscriber to propose a phone voting, the > user being asked either to ring a specific number according to his > choice, or to ring a unique number and, after prompting, to give > his choice by keyboard or by voice dialogue.
  * Televoting enables subscribers to survey public opinion using the > telephone network. Persons wishing to respond to an opinion poll > can call advertised televoting numbers to register their votes. > The charging is to the discretion of the service subscriber.
  * Using this service, the network operator can temporarily allocate > directory numbers to the served user. Each time a call is made to > one of the numbers by an end user, the user will be played an > announcement acknowledging the call, and a count of calls made to > this number will be incremented. When televoting has ceased, the > network operator will supply details of the total numbers of calls > made to each number to the served user and the special numbers > will be reallocated. Calls made to these special numbers may be > charged at varying rates.
Terminating call screening (TCS)
  * Terminating calls may be controlled by the terminating call > screening capability. This allows the subscriber to specify that > incoming calls be either restricted or allowed, according to a > screening list and optionally, by time of day control.
Universal access number (UAN)
  * This service allows a subscriber with several terminating lines in > any number of locations or zones to be reached with a unique > directory number. The subscriber may specify which incoming calls > are to be routed to which terminating lines, based upon the area > the call originated.

  * As an option, to each private user, either a class of service or > specific rights and privileges may be attributed. As another > option, a private user may access his private network from any > point in the network keeping, after authentication, his class of > service or his specific rights and privileges.
  * This service permits the use of public network resources to provide > private network capabilities without necessarily using dedicated > network resources. The subscriber\'s lines, connected to different > network switches, constitutes a virtual private network that may > include private network capabilities, such as dialling > restrictions, private numbering plan, hold, call transfer, and so > on.
  * A PNP may provide a group of users the capability to place calls by > using digit sequences having different structures and meaning than > provided by the public numbering plan, or PNP may utilize the > public numbering plan\'s digit sequences, structures and meaning.
  * VPN allows a subscriber to define and use a private numbering plan > for communication across one or more networks between nominated > user access interfaces. A PNP provides a group of users the > capability to place calls by using digit sequences having > different structures and meanings than provided by the public > numbering plan.

IN CS-2 [91] defines an initial subset of IN capabilities that meet the
following general criteria:
  * IN CS-2 is a subset of the target Intelligent Network architecture;
  * IN CS-2 is a superset of IN CS-1, as defined in the IN CS-1 > Recommendations;
  * IN CS-2 is a set of definitions of capabilities that is of direct > use to both manufacturers and network operators;
  * IN CS-2 provides network capabilities defined to support the set of > IN CS-2 benchmark services or service features. These capabilities > can also be used for the support of other services that may, or > may not, be standardized by ITU-T.
The IN CS-2 architecture could be applied for PSTN, ISDN, and mobile networks.
Three types of services have been identified in IN CS-2:
  * telecommunication service;
  * service management service; and
  * service creation services.
The last two types of services are first introduced in IN CS-2.
According to [91] the following descriptions of the services additional to CS1
comprising CS2 are valid:
**_Telecommunication services_**
**Mobility service features (UPT, FPLMTS)**
These service features are aimed at, but not limited to, supporting UPT and
FPLMTS.
_Personal mobility features (UPT):_ Personal mobility allows a user to appear
at any network access point and initiate telecommunication services.
  * User authentication (UAUT): This feature confirms the identity of a > user with the network and the identity of the network with a user. > UAUT takes place during interactions between the network and a > user.
  * User registration (UREG): This feature enables a user to register on > a terminal access for the purpose of receiving or placing calls.
  * in-call registration: means by which a user registers from the > current terminal address for incoming calls to be presented to > that terminal address.
  * Outgoing call registration (OGREG): The out-call registration allows > a user from the current terminal address to register for outgoing > calls to be made from that terminal address.
  * Secure answering (SANSW): Secure answering is a feature by which the > service subscriber/user requires that incoming calls cannot be > answered unless the answering party first successfully > authenticates himself as the wanted subscriber.
  * Follow-on (FO): This feature enables a user to make a series of > service requests without going through the identification and > authentication process before each service feature request.
  * Flexible (call) origination authorization (FOA): The FOA feature can > take effect immediately prior to the time that an IN capable > switch would authorize call origination, during the call set-up > process. A customized algorithm, provided by the network provider > or the subscriber, can then determine whether or not the call > should be originated.
  * Flexible (call) termination authorization (FTA): The FTA feature can > take effect immediately prior to the time that an IN capable > switch would authorize call termination, during the call set-up > process. A customized algorithm, provided by the network provider > or the subscriber, can then determine whether or not the call > should be authorized.
  * Provision of stored messages (PSM): When the service subscriber > registers the location, the network automatically informs the > subscriber of the service and sends the voice messages which were > stored before.
  * Multiple terminal address registration (MTAR): This service feature > enables a user to be registered for incoming calls on more than > one terminal, with calls being offered to the terminals according > to a certain algorithm (e.g. in sequence if there is no answer > after a user-determined time (i.e. a user-configurable hunt > group), and simultaneously).
  * Intended recipient identity presentation (IRIP): This service > feature allows identification at the receiving terminal of the > intended recipient of an incoming call. It is required to enable > Secure Answering (SANSW) to be offered when there is more than one > UPT user registered for incoming calls on the one terminal.
  * Blocking/unblocking of incoming calls (BUIC): This service feature > enables any person, even if not a UPT user, to block and unblock > calls incoming to UPT users currently registered on the third > party\'s terminal.
_Terminal mobility features (FPLMTS):_ Terminal mobility provides a tetherless
link between the user\'s terminal equipment and fixed network access points,
thereby providing freedom of movement for the user during the use of
telecommunication services and service features.
  * Terminal authentication (TAUT): The TAUT feature is initiated within > the mobility processes of location management (i.e. terminal > location registration), call origination, call delivery and at > other times as initiated by the network or terminal. In support of > security, the feature ensures the validity of the terminal and the > network. Also, the feature enables the establishment of a private > control and communications channel between the network and a > terminal. Authentication process should occur when a terminal > authenticates either in its home network or visited network.
  * Handover (HOV): The handover (HOV) service feature enables a mobile > terminal to change network access areas/points within a network or > to an other network, while maintaining the call(s) and/or > signalling relationship(s).
  * Terminal location registration (TLR): Terminal location registration > is used when terminals notify the system of their location.
  * Terminal attach/detach (ATDT): The detach feature is used by the > terminal to notify the network whether the terminal is temporarily > not reachable. The network will modify the status information of > the terminal.
  * Terminal paging (TPAG): This service feature enables the > determination of the current location of a user or of a mobile > terminal. It pages the terminal in the terminal location > registration area based on the stored terminal location > information, and determines the visited cell by the response from > the terminal.
  * Radio paging (RPAG): This service feature enables one-way personal > selective calling with alert. The RPAG feature enables a user to > send a message, either voice, tone, or alphanumeric, to a selected > pager terminal or a group of terminals.
  * Emergency calls in wireless (ECW): The ECW service feature allows > emergency calls to have priority over all other calls to ensure > service. Emergency calls can be readily connected without dropping > other active calls and without the requirement of successful > terminal authentication, privacy or user authentication.
  * Terminal equipment validation (TEVA): The TEVA feature should be > considered as a part of the mobility processes of location > management (i.e. terminal location registration), call > origination, call delivery and at other times as initiated by the > network or terminal. The feature enables FPLMTS network operator > to identify stolen, lost, suspicious or non-type-approved terminal > equipment and then track or prevent the use of this terminal > equipment. A blacklist of the identities of individual stolen, > lost or suspicious terminal equipment and a white list of the > identities of typeâ€‘approved terminal equipment will be needed.
  * Cryptographic information management (CIM): Cryptographic > information management is a service feature which manages the > secret information associated with cryptographic security > mechanism including: the enhanced authentication mechanism, the > integrity mechanism, and the encipherment mechanism.
**Other services**
  * Internetwork Freephone (IFPH): This service allows the served user > having one or more installations to be reached from a specific > network other than his/her network with a freephone number, and to > be charged for this kind of call.

**_Service management services_**
**Definition**
  * Service control service enables a subscriber to directly change the > value of the parameters of his/her subscription to a > telecommunication service and a service monitoring service after > the service provisioning.
  * Service control parameters are what a subscriber can directly > control regarding a subscription to a telecommunication service > and a service monitoring service. The service control parameters > available for control within this subscription are specified by > service customization parameters.
  * Service monitoring service enables a subscriber to get information > about the usage of a subscription to telecommunication service > after the service provisioning.
  * Service monitoring data are what a subscriber can directly monitor > regarding a subscription to a telecommunication service.
  * Service customization service provides the capability to select the > type of telecommunication service feature, service control > service, and service monitoring service to be provided to the > subscriber after provisioning.
  * Service customization parameters define the services, parameters, > and data which a subscriber can manipulate as part of his/her > subscription to a telecommunication service, service control > service, and service monitoring service.
Service management processes are the following types of activity performed by
network operators/service providers:
  * Service deployment is the introduction of a service into the > IN-structured network in a subscriber independent way.
  * Service provisioning is the initial installation and deployment of > necessary resources and data in appropriate network elements to > provide a service subscription to a specific subscriber.
  * Management during the service utilization contains service > monitoring, service maintenance, service traffic management, audit > administration, and billing activities.
The capabilities of service management will not be reflected in the end-user
model and are thus not described further.

IN CS-3 [92] defines a set of IN capabilities that meet the following general
criteria:
  * IN CS-3 is a subset of the target Intelligent Networks architecture;
  * IN CS-3 is a superset of IN CS-2, as defined in the IN CS-2 > Recommendations;
  * IN CS-3 is a set of definitions of capabilities that is help to both > manufacturers and network service providers/operators; and
  * IN CS-3 provides network capabilities defined to support the set of > IN CS-3 benchmark services and service features. These > capabilities can also be used to support other services that may, > or may not, be standardized by ITU-T.
**_Service features of IN CS-3 according to [92]._**
**_Basic features_**
  * CCBS support (CCBS): Call Completion to Busy Subscriber support by > IN functionality to enable for example CCBS in combination with > call-related IN number translation services/features like Number > Portability, Personal Number. These IN services can be invoked > either at local exchange level or at transit exchange level.
  * Correlation of Call Detail Record (CDR) Information from Multiple > Entities (CICME): It shall be possible for a network or service > provider to collect CDR information from different physical > entities in the network involved in the same call, and be able to > correlate the information in the billing systems.
  * Carrier Selection Handling (CSHND): For IN initiated calls and > terminal initiated calls that are handled in IN it shall be > possible to have control over carrier selection. This can be done > on a perâ€‘call basis or by subscription or default. This is an > extension of an IN CS-2 capability.
  * IN Calling Line presentation restriction (ICLPR): It should be > possible for an IN service subscriber to offer the IN number as > COLP number, but restrict presentation of the number.
  * Inter-Network Service Indicator (INSIN): Permits the receiving > network, in an inter-network call, to receive from the originating > network, an indication of the service used in the received call.
  * Language Selection for User Interaction (LASUI): Based on e.g. > subscriber preferences, user interaction towards a subscriber can > be performed in a certain language. If the preferred language is > not available, user interaction will fallback to a default > language.
  * Line Restrictions Override (LRORI): Switch-based line restrictions > are implemented in almost all networks. Presently a violation of > line restrictions is modelled as an error which leads to the PIC > O_exception. It should be possible to allow a per-call basis > overriding of these restrictions after entering a password.
  * Menu driven user interaction (MEDUI): Display of information by the > user\'s terminal, with the possibility to perform menu driven user > interaction. Service to user information is presented graphically, > while the user communicates towards the service via the dial-pad.
  * Modem Detection During User Interaction (MDDUI): When performing > prompt and collect user information, e.g. when offering a random > call service via IN (using network initiated call followed by > connection to a SRF), one of the possible error conditions from > service perspective is that the dialled number is connected to an > analogue fax or other modem. The SRF detects this, and informs > service logic that a modem was encountered.
  * Screening Service with an Open Numbering Plan (SCONP): A screening > service can be provided in an open numbering plan environment, > that is, a numbering plan with variable number length. This > implies that the SCF cannot always know how many digits are to be > expected still.
  * Simultaneous User Interaction (SIMUI): When party A calls party B, > party A can initially hear, for example, a Ring Back Tone from > party B\'s local exchange. As soon as party B answers, an > announcement is played immediately to both party A and B. These > announcements are not necessarily the same.
  * Time announcement and disconnect (TADIS): The user receives an > announcement that he will be disconnected after a certain period, > and is subsequently disconnected after that period. This could for > example be used in combination with prepaid charging method, where > this feature is activated on credit limit expiry.
  * Triggering on Call Failure Condition (TRCFC): If a Call Failure > condition is detected early by a service logic in a certain node > (e.g. by user profile consultation, rather than late through an > ISUP Release message), it should be possible to use this as a > trigger for services located in a different node.
  * VPN Node Interface (VPNNI): Private networks (e.g. PBXs) can > exchange VPN information (PSS1) via the signalling in the public > network (via the Application Protocol transport Mechanism of > ISUP). Service providers shall be able to monitor and control the > use of this capability.
  * The public network can terminate the VPN PINX context, and provide > outgoing gateway PINX functionality depending on the functionality > supported by (or required to reach) the called party, or depending > on e.g. subscriptions.
**_Interworking between IN and IP networks_**
  * Request-to-Call-Back CSN (RTCBC): A user is able to initiate a > telephone call by clicking a button during a Web session. The call > can be first set up in the direction of the requester of the call, > or first be set up in the direction of the party the requester > wants to be connected to. E.164 addressing for both A-party and > B-party is assumed, and both parties are assumed to be connected > to the Switched Circuit Network.
  * Request-to-Call CSN (RQTCC): A user is able to initiate a telephone > call by clicking a button during a Web session. The requested call > is to be set up between two parties identified by E.164 addresses, > which are connected to the Switched Circuit Network. The requester > him/herself may or may not take part in the call to be set up.
**_Personal and terminal mobility support_**
  * UPT registration with smart card (SCREG): a UPT user can register > with the telecommunications network by using a smart card.
  * UPT Originating Call without registration (UOCWR): a UPT user > registers him/herself from a certain terminal, and can from then > on make UPT calls without explicit per-call identification. In the > meantime other users can use the phone for their calls as well, > without being identified as the UPT user.
  * User Identity Confirmation (USIDC): feature enabling a user to > confirm its identity to a network. This confirmation can be > requested by the network prior to service invocation, or in an > early phase of the service offering, call related or call > unrelated.
  * Network Identity Confirmation (NWIDC): feature enabling a network to > confirm its identity to a user. This shall be provided to the user > in case of user registration in the case of a roaming user. It can > also be provided prior to service invocation, or in an early phase > of a service offering, call related or call unrelated.
  * Non-Repudiation (NOREP): the capability of the network or service > provider to provide a proof of use towards a user of his services > and resources. Some capabilities are provided in present day > systems, like storage of data including PIN codes in the SCF/SDF.
  * Call Forwarding on Not Reachable Condition (CFNRC): enables a served > user to have the network redirect calls which are addressed to the > served user\'s directory number to another directory number, in > case the served user is not reachable. The CFNRC IN service > operates on all calls. After the CFNRC service has been activated, > calls are forwarded only if the served user is not reachable via > the dialled directory number, e.g. user\'s cordless terminal is > not reachable.
**_IN support for B-ISDN_**

  * Inhibition Of Call Waiting Indication (IOCWI): The ability for a > service logic to inhibit the invocation of the switch based call > waiting service.
  * Logical Referral plus Language Choice for Voice User Interaction > (LRLCV): For all voice user interaction it is possible to refer to > the message in the SRF via a logical reference, and select the > language via a separate parameter. This includes voice user > interaction related to call gapping and filtering.
  * Modem Detection Request (MODDR): When requesting the SRF to perform > a prompt and collect user interaction, the SCF requests the SRF to > perform a check on the presence of a modem (e.g. analogue fax), > and to stop user interaction and report back when this situation > occurs.
  * Multiple points of control (MPCTR): More than one service logic > programs are allowed to act on the same (half) call (Retriggering > in same SSP).
  * Multiple points of control User Interaction (MPCUI): An SCF shall be > able to request an SSF to connect a resource (for User > Interaction) on one leg of call already involved in another User > Interaction.

  * SCF Control Less Digits Received (SCLDR): Allows the SCF to receive > a report of collected digits, when complete called party number > has been determined in the CCF/SSF and the SCF does not know the > exact number of digits to be collected, e.g. due to an open > Numbering Plan.
  * The SCF requests the SSF for a certain number of additional digits, > while indicating the SSF not to clear the call if a timeout occurs > before the requested number of digits is received, but to give > control over the call-back to the SCF.
  * INAP interworking with Server Display Script Services (SDSSI): The > SCF controls Server Display Script Services (SDSS) information > exchange between the user terminal and the SDSS application.
  * The SDSS protocol on the analogue interface (V23) is presently used > to enhance the User Interface ergonomy of PSTN supplementary > services located in the switch.
  * Terminal Alerting before data transmission (TABDT): Before sending > data to a terminal, e.g. SDSS information, an alerting signal is > sent to the terminal (and acknowledged). The role of this signal > is to notify the terminal equipment that data transmission is > expected, while avoiding unwanted bell tinkle.

##### 5.1.3.8.1.1 ETSI (INAP:) {#etsi-inap .H6}
[63] defines the Intelligent Network Application Protocol (INAP) required for
support of Capability Set 1 (CS1). It supports interactions between the
following three Functional Entities (FEs), as defined in the Intelligent
Network (IN) functional model:
  * Service Switching Function (SSF);
  * Service Control Function (SCF);
  * Specialized Resource Function (SRF).
The scope of this ETS is the further development of the INAP for both the
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Public Switched
Telecommunications Network (PSTN). It is intended as a guide to implementers
and network operators to ensure interworking between different manufacturers\'
equipment for the IN CS1 defined interfaces (SCFâ€‘SSF and SCF-SRF).
[64] defines the Intelligent Network Application Protocol (INAP) required for
support of Capability Set 2 (CS2). It supports interactions between the
following five Functional Entities (FEs), as defined in the Intelligent
Network (IN) functional model:
  * Service Switching Function (SSF);
  * Service Control Function (SCF);
  * Service Data Function (SDF);
  * Call Unrelated Service Function (CUSF);
  * Specialized Resource Function (SRF).
The further development of the INAP for each of the Integrated Services
Digital Network (ISDN) and Public Switched Telecommunications Network (PSTN)
and Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMN) is covered by the present document,
which is intended as a guide to implementers and network operators to ensure
interworking between different manufacturers\' equipment for the following IN
CS2 defined interfaces:
  * SCF-SSF;
  * SCF-CUSF;
  * SCF-SRF;
  * SCF-SDF;
  * SCF-SCF; and
  * SDF-SDF.
The scope of the IN Distributed Functional Plane (DFP) architecture (see [65]
and supporting protocol for IN capability set 3 (IN CS-3) is driven by the
requirements of the services desired for IN CS-3, and constrained by the
capabilities of the embedded base of network technology. The functionality
required to support IN CS-3 services includes functionality to provide:
  * end user access to call/service processing;
  * call-related service invocation and control;
  * end user interaction with service control;
  * service management;
  * Call Party Handling;
  * Internetworking;
  * Security;
  * Out-Channel User Interaction;
  * call unrelated service invocation and control; and
  * Feature Interactions.

### 5.1.4 Generic User Profile (GUP)
#### 5.1.4.1 General Ideas
Because of:
  * the several domains within the 3GPP mobile system core and access > technologies (which lead to a wide distribution of data associated > with the end-user); and
  * new functions both in terminals and networks (which leads to an > increase in data related to Users, Services and User Equipment);
difficulties for Users, Subscribers, network Operators and Value added service
providers to create, access and manage the user-related data located in
different entities can be expected.
Thus 3GPP defines a Generic User Profile [54] in order to provide a means to
enable harmonized usage of the user-related information originating from
different entities. It represents a collection of User-related data which
influence individual user experiences services where a community of entities
share this data. The 3GPP Generic User Profile can be stored in the home
network environment and/or Value Added Service Provider equipment.
The 3GPP Generic User Profile will be accessed by different stakeholders:
  * Subscriber: The subscriber may hold subscriptions for one user (e.g. > in the case the subscriber is identical with the user) or several > users (e.g. in the case of a company - the subscriber - holding > subscriptions for it\'s employees - the users)
  * User: The user may or may not be identical with the Subscriber.
  * Value Added Service Provider.
  * Home Network Operator.
  * Roamed-to Network Operator.
  * Regulator.
GUP will be managed either:
  * by one (centralized); or
  * by different stakeholders (de-centralized), such as the:
\- user;
\- subscriber;
\- value added service provider; and
\- network operator by a standardized access mechanism.
The 3GPP Generic User Profile allows data exchange between applications within
a mobile operator\'s network and between mobile operator\'s network and value
added service providers.
The 3GPP Generic User Profile may be also be used by different applications in
a standardized way.
For each user, one User Profile exists, which may consist of several
\'components\' distributed in the home network and value added service
provider\'s environment. Within the home network, the components may be
distributed in various network nodes. Only one master of the component exists,
but one or more copies of the master component may exist. The home operator
shall be able to copy master components, which are located outside the home
network to the home network. Within the home network, functionality exists
that is able to locate GUP components, thereby making applications unaware of
the actual location of the components. The administration and management of
the data associated with this functionality is under the control of the home
network. Although GUP does not attempt to provide an actual classification of
the data it may contain, one may consider categorizations such as:
  * Authorized and subscribed services information: generally owned by > the home operator and allow management and interrogation of > subscription information and would typically consist of:
\- authorized services that the subscriber may subscribe to;
\- services the subscriber actually has subscribed to.
  * General user information: Data, owned by the user, which are not > specific to individual services, but may be useful for any > service. These would be data like:
\- settings (e.g. name, postal address), preferences (e.g. language);
\- Registered Service Profiles of the user, indicating the currently active
Service Profile of the user.
  * PLMN specific user information: Data, owned by the home operator, > which are not specific to individual services, but may be useful > for any service. These typically would be data like:
\- addresses (e.g. MSISDNs, URLs) of the user;
\- WAP parameters (e.g. standard WAP gateway);
\- GPRS parameters (in UE and HSS);
\- Preferred access technologies (The preferred access technology, second
preferred access technology etc. e.g. UTRAN, GERAN, WLAN, etc.).
  * Privacy control data of the user: specific to individual services > and which control privacy settings of that service. These could > e.g. be
\- Privacy settings for standardized services like the Presence service or
Push service.
\- Privacy settings of non-standardized services.
  * Service specific information of the user: Data, owned by the user or > value added service provider, which are specific to individual > services (standardized or non-standardized). These could e.g. be:
\- Service customization data of the user.
\- Service authentication- and authorization data (for \"single sign on\")
like keys, certificates, passwords, etc.
  * Terminal related data: data, which relate in particular to the > user\'s terminals (ME and UICC). These could e.g. consist of:
\- Terminal capabilities of the terminal currently in use (e.g. User Interface
capabilities, communication capabilities, available services, service
capabilities, etc.).
\- Data for initial configuration and/or reset of the ME.
\- Backup data for recovery of the ME configuration including service specific
data.
  * Charging and billing related data: consists of information necessary > for the user related charging and billing. This data could e.g. > consist of:
\- The billing policy.
The following data categories are not considered to be useful for the 3GPP
Generic User Profile:
  * Run Time Data.: Data that are created during the initiation of the > session, call or application execution and if they are only > available during the lifetime of such session, call or application > execution then they are considered as Run Time data.
  * Historic/Statistic Data.: User/system behaviour information (e.g. > statistics on the usage preferred web pages; duration, number of > calls, error rate).
The GUP reference architecture [11] as shown (see figure 5.1.4.1.1) consists
of:
  * GUP Server: functional entity providing a single point of access to > the Generic User Profile data of a particular subscriber. The > reference architecture does not specify or limit the physical > location of the GUP Server enabling flexibility in the > implementations. The GUP Server shall be located in the home > operator network of the targeted subscriber. The GUP Server may > support two modes of operation:
\- Proxy Mode.
\- Redirect Mode.
  * Repository Access Function (RAF): The Repository Access Function > (RAF) realizes the harmonized access interface. It hides the > implementation details of the data repositories from the GUP > infrastructure. The RAF performs protocol and data transformation > where needed.
  * GUP Data Repositories: Each GUP Data Repository stores the primary > master copy of one or several profile components. The RAF provides > for the standardized access to the GUP Data Repository. The > storage formats or the interface between the RAF and GUP Data > Repository are not specified by GUP.
  * Rg and Rp reference points:
\- Rg: This reference point shall allow applications to create, read, modify
and delete any user profile data using the harmonized access interface. The

Figure 5.1.4.1.1: GUP Architecture according to 3GPP [11]
The following is a short excerpt of the description of the information model
for GUP [11]. A Generic User Profile consists of independent components. A GUP
Component may contain (i.e. reference) other GUP components e.g. to enable
reuse of data.
The GUP Component has a unique identity within the Generic User Profile. In
addition to the component type the component identity contains either a
subscriber identity or more generic identification depending on which kind of
component is in question. A GUP Component can be retrieved through one RAF,
and it may consist of a number of GUP Components, Data Element Groups and/or
Data Elements.
A GUP Component contains zero or more Data Element Groups. The Data Element
Group contains indivisible Data Elements and/or Data Element Groups. The
nested Data Elements Groups allow deeper hierarchical structures. The Data
Element Group in the lowest hierarchical level contains one or more Data
Elements. The Data Element Groups inside a GUP Component may be of the same or
different types.
Alternatively the GUP Component may contain zero or more Data Elements without
the Data Element Groups. A GUP component shall have at least one Data Element
Group or Data Element.
A Composite Datatype is used to define the structure of the whole GUP
Component. The structure includes definition about what kind of Data Element
Groups and/or which Data Elements belong to the defined GUP Component as well
as the data types and valid values of the data.
Figure 5.1.4.1.2 illustrates the basic concepts of the GUP Information Model.

  * Application layer:
\- Application level interface specification. All the operations and data are
described by XML elements and attributes in an XML Schema and WSDL.
\- The standard XML Schema is defined by W3C in \"XML Schema Part 1:
Structures\", Recommendation and \"XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes,\"
Recommendation.
  * SOAP (Session layer):
\- SOAP is an XML based messaging protocol that provides support for remote
procedure calls by messaging.
\- A few specific header types are defined for GUP e.g. for message IDs and
time stamps.
  * HTTP (Transport layer):
\- HTTP defines how messages are transmitted and formatted.
  * TCP/IP (Network layer):
\- TCP/IP handles network communications between network nodes. GUP does not
define any special requirements for this layer.
### 5.1.5 Management Applications
#### 5.1.5.1 Subscriber Management
##### 5.1.5.1.1 ITU-T
In [94] ITU-T describes its management philosophy and lists the tasks for each
of the management layers it defines. ITU-T does so by identifying functions
and function sets.
In the annex of [94] some scenarios are described, which show, how the
functions and function sets are related to each other. As one topic ITU-T
deals with customer administration.
  * Service activation:
\- Scenario 1: This scenario incorporates many activities of all FCAPS areas
associated with service activation. As a result, ITU-T regards it more of a
reference scenario than a view of an actual sequence of activities.
This flow is triggered by a customer request for service. While the scenario
explicitly illustrates a request to activate new service, the flow is similar
for making changes to existing service and discontinuing service. The request
may be made by a person or via a machine-to-machine interface.
\- Scenario 2: ITU-T assumes that all equipment is in place and that
activation will occur at the time of assignment (i.e. immediately). As with
scenario 1, this flow is triggered by a customer request for service. While
the scenario explicitly illustrates a request to activate new service, the
flow is similar for making changes to existing service and discontinuing
service.
  * Service change:
\- Scenario 3: this scenario shows how a customer may make changes to the
services under his control and how those changes may affect the network. A
customer with network management capabilities initiates a request to activate
existing capacity that has been designated for his use.
  * Status of service information:
\- Scenario 4: A customer with network management capabilities initiates a
request to see the status of their network.
\- Scenario 5: A similar flow could be initiated by Notification of state
changes in NEs and would be used to provide automatic notification of network
information to the customer. The NE would initiate the flow and the
information about the state change would flow up.
  * Trouble report:
\- Scenario 6: A customer reports a trouble to Trouble Administration. The
service and underlying infrastructure is tested and reported, if appropriate
to fault correction. This scenario is somewhat complex, with some branching of
the flow. The scenario ends with clearing of the fault.
##### 5.1.5.1.2 3GPP
According to [6] SuM shall permit Service Providers and Operators to provision
services for a specific customer service subscription.
Specific areas of attention are:
  * Subscription information is distributed across in a number of > locations.
  * Service Providers and Operators have to be able to provision, > control and monitor the subscription information.
  * SuM has to link together features across multiple Operators\' > Operations Support Systems (OSSs).
  * SuM will need to manage subscription information in e.g. the OSSs, > HSS, UE, OSA, MMS and IMS subsystems.
  * The common components between the GUP and the subscription profile.
Specific attention is drawn to the alignment with TMF. 3GPP\'s SuM, in
particular the configuration of resources, aligns with subset of the TOM model
in the area of fulfilment.
**Architecture:**
[7] defines the architecture for Subscription Management (SuM), which can be
found in figure 5.1.5.1.1.1.
{width="5.958333333333333in" height="4.09375in"}
Figure 5.1.5.1.1.1: SuM functional entities according to 3GPP [7]
In [7] 3GPP deals with the SuM - OSF functionality contained in the Core
Network Basic Entities Domain and specifically with the one of the Common CN
Domain. Subscription Profile Components are located in the NEs\' OSFs within
the Common CN Domain or their NEs\' OSFs in the NE management systems as shown
in figure 5.1.5.1.1.2.
{width="6.7in" height="2.25in"}
Figure 5.1.5.1.1.2: PLMN Telecom Management Domains according to 3GPP [7]
According to [7] access to the Subscription Profile Components are based on
the IRP (Integration Reference Point) manager-agent concept.
An IRPAgent implements and supports this (SuM) IRP. The IRPAgent can reside in
an Element Manager (EM) or a Network Element (NE).
An IRPManager using this SuM-IRP shall choose one of the two System Contexts
defined.
According to [7] IRP security shall be achieved by controlling access to the
network and management systems.
[7] suggests the reuse of GUP stage 3 for SuM IRP Solution Sets where
possible. An interpretation of the relationship of Itf-N realization (for SuM)
to the GUP reference architecture.
[9] defines the Network Resources Model (NRM) for the SuM IRP. In detail the
meaning of Mandatory and Optional IOC attributes and associations between IOCs
is defined for the following Solution Sets to the IRP.
Solution Sets to the SuM IRP:
  * The IRPManager shall support all Mandatory attributes/associations. > The IRPManager shall be prepared to receive information related to > Mandatory as well as Optional attributes/associations without > failure; however the IRPManager does not have to support handling > of the Optional attributes/associations.
  * The IRPAgent shall support all Mandatory attributes/associations. It > may support Optional attributes/associations.

Figure 5.1.5.1.1.3: SuM NRM Containment/Naming according to 3GPP [9]
[9] defines the Naming Hierarchy and relations between the modelled entities
(see figure 5.1.5.1.1.3 for an example) as well as the inheritance (see figure
5.1.5.1.1.4 for an example), which are both copies from [9].

##### 5.1.5.1.3 3GPP2
Subscription management in [28]. treats the various topics related to
subscription management in the functional parts they belong to.
**_Architecture_**
AAA functionality:
  * Authentication Function: provides Authentication of terminal devices > and subscribers.
  * The Authorization Function: provides authorization of requests for > services and/or bandwidth, etc. and has access to the Policy > Repository, the Directory Services, Subscriber Profiles, and the > Device Register.
  * The Accounting Function: gathers data concerning the services, QoS, > and multimedia resources requested and used by individual > subscribers.
Data Base:
The DB is a network component that may support both the Multimedia and Legacy
MS Domains. The information in the core network DBs may include but is not
limited to:
  * EIR;
  * Dynamic Subscriber Information;
  * Network Policy Rules; and
  * Subscriber Profile data;
  * The Legacy MS Domain Support.
The HLRe manages the subscriber profile for both:
  * voice services (e.g. Call Forwarding, Three Way Calling, Message > Waiting Notification); and
  * data services (e.g. Priority). Subscriber profile information may be > accessed from the HLRe or may be downloaded to a serving system as > needed.
The HLRe manages subscriber location and/or accessibility information. This
includes updating the dynamic subscriber information database with current
domain information (e.g. MSCe address) and with MS status information (e.g.
SMS pending flag). The HLRe interacts with the location database to update or
retrieve current location information.
The MRFC, in conjunction with the MRFP, provides a set of resources within the
core network that are useful in supporting services to subscribers. The MRFC,
in conjunction with the MRFP, provides multi-way conference bridges,
announcement playback services, tone playback services, etc.
The MRFC controls allocation, de-allocation, and modification of the usage of
resources of the MRFP.
Reference Point m4 is the management interface between OSF-EML / OSF-NML/OSS
and 3GPP2 NAM Databases, such as Network Policy Rules and Subscriber Profile
(applicable definitions provided by S.S0028-A).
The MS is a wireless terminal used by subscribers to access the Legacy MS
Domain or the IP Multimedia Domain services over a radio interface. MSs
include portable units (e.g. hand-held units), units installed in vehicles,
and somewhat paradoxically, fixed location MSs. The MS is the interface
equipment used to terminate the radio path at the subscriber. A MS is a ME
with a programmed UIM.
The Legacy MS Domain provides support for existing MSs (e.g. analog, IS-95-A,
IS-95-B, cdma2000) in an IP core network environment. This domain supports the
features and capabilities provided in a legacy network in a manner transparent
to the user. New features and capabilities supported by the IP core network
may be made available to subscribers where they are supported by the MS
capabilities.
Services supported on the SCP make use of information stored in the Databases
component of the core network, including subscriber information, and may
interact with service applications.
The Service Management System (SMS) provides overall service management
functionality for the network. Service providers and third party application
developers may use different versions of the SMS. The SMS interacts with the
SCE and other entities to perform service provisioning, monitoring, testing,
deployment, and subscriber data management functions.
##### 5.1.5.1.4 TISPAN
According to TISPAN [25] Subscription Management is a key feature that allows:
  * service providers and operators to provision their TISPAN NGN > network entities with the data necessary for delivering services > for a specific subscriber; and
  * subscribers to configure their services when they have this > capabilities.
Starting point of TISPAN\'S Subscription Management is the 3GPP IRP concept
(with slight modifications) and the 3GPP specifications on Subscription
Management. TISPAN\'s Subscription Management also aligns with subset of the
eTOM fulfilment process.
TISPAN sees Subscription Management as tool for the service providers to
leverage their network resources to:
  * Validate (register, authenticate, and authorize.) a request for > service from a user;
  * Collect, store, update, and distribute the Service Profile > information for the user;
  * Select the trusted network resources to manage access, distribution, > and control of the profile data information for the user; and
  * Direct the network resources to promptly deliver the service > requested to the user according to said profile information.
Subscription management fulfils the following essential TISPAN NGN
requirements [25]:
  * The \"User equipment Diversity\" allows the users to access their > TISPAN NGN services by a variety of UEs.
  * The \"Service Diversity\" allows the users to access TISPAN NGN > services provided by service providers or third party application > server providers.
  * The \"Access Diversity\" allows the users to access their TISPAN NGN > services over a wide variety of network access such as xDSL, WLAN, > GPRS, etc.
  * Nomadism: allows the users to access their TISPAN NGN services in > multiple nomadism scenarios.
At present [80] contains the specification of the requirements for the
following:
  * An end-to-end information model to cover all the mandatory/optional > information related to subscription management that shall be > provisioned on the NGN Network.
  * A subscription management functional architecture which hides the > complexity of the different functional entities to be configured > including the CPE and the AS.
  * Only Service Configuration and Activation aspects are addressed > within this first release of [25].
In [25] Subscription Management is seen as the framework that offers service
providers the means for efficient management of all the data related to a
specific subscription.
As depicted in figure 5.1.5.1.3.1, the SuM framework is responsible for
handling only the data related to the service delivery of a specific
subscription. Moreover, the data provisioned thanks to the subscription
management framework can also be used in other mechanisms such as monitoring,
billing, etc.
Subscription Management framework, as shown in figure 5.1.5.1.3.1, involves
the following entities:
  * Service Provider : offers a set of services.
  * Subscriber: may subscribe to one ore more services. The service > provide will have then to manage the corresponding subscription by > provisioning the necessary data and giving the following rights to > the subscriber:
\- To become a user by using the services.
\- Give rights to its users, who will be then linked (or associated) to this
subscription.
  * User: use the authorized services.
  * Services.
{width="6.371527777777778in" height="3.982638888888889in"}
Figure 5.1.5.1.3.1: SuM Framework according to TISPAN [25]
The eTOM fulfilment process is composed of the following process:
  * Selling, Marketing fulfilment response and order handling.
  * Service Configuration and Activation.
  * Resource Provisioning.
  * S/P Requisition Management.
According to [25] Subscription Management must define the following:
  * An end-to-end information model to cover all the mandatory/optional > information related to subscription management that must be > provisioned in the NGN Network.
  * A subscription management functional architecture which hides the > complexity of the different functional entities to be configured > including the CPE and the AS.
For the end-to-end information model, the objectives are to describe the
concepts (data, attributes and relations) necessary for the provisioning of
services for a specific subscriber. The provisioned data can be either static
or dynamic, but only static data will be covered within[80]. Static data are
permanent or semi-permanent data. Typically static data are provisioned during
the process of service and network resources configuration and are non
modifiable during a NGN session. Dynamic data are characterized by frequent
changes. For example, the IP address allocated to an equipment in the access
network is a dynamic data because it is allocated for a given lifetime.
**Requirements on the information model**
Within this 1^st^ release of the document, SuM shall handle the following
information parts:
  * Information that need to be provisioned by Resource Provisioning > Process on the NGN functional entities;
  * Information exchanged between Service Configuration & Activation and > Resource Provisioning process.
Requirement 1: The SuM information model shall be flexible in way that adding
new information can be achieved easily and without modifications to the
existing information and relationships.
Requirement 2: The SuM information model terminology shall be in line with all
the IMS information model terminology, and SuM model relationships must be in
line with IMS model relationships defined by 3GPP.
Requirement 3: The SuM Information Model shall be connected to an existing
\"model infrastructure\".
  * Examples of \"model infrastructure\" are:
\- the TMF Shared Information/Data Model (SID);
\- the TISPAN Management Information Model (MIM);
\- UML, etc.
  * According to [25] the most promising candidate to connect the SuM > Information model to is TISPAN WG8\'s Management Information Model > (MIM).
Requirement 4: The SuM Information Model shall model the ability to grant
different configuration rights for service usage to different users.
Requirement 5: All key concepts and entities must be referred by a use case.
Requirement 6: The 3GPP SuM NRM model (see above) should be re-used as much as
possible.
**Requirements on the functional architecture**
Requirement 1: The purpose of the SuM Functional Architecture is the design of
the NOSIs needed for management of a specific Subscriber, User, Service
Profile and User Services.
Requirement 2: The SuM Functional Architecture shall deliver the necessary
NOSIs for the Resource Provisioning and Service Activation processes.
Requirement 3: The SuM functional architecture shall hide the complexity of
the different functional entities to be configured including the CPE and the
AS.
**Requirements on TISPAN NGN functional entities**
The master NGN functional entities where subscription data are stored are the
following:
  * UPSF;
  * AS;
  * CLF;
  * NACF;
  * PDBF;
  * CPE.
Requirement 1: The SuM Framework shall allow the creation, read, update, and
deletion of subscription data within the above entities.
**Security Requirements**
General Requirement: The SuM solution shall comply with specific local,
national, and regional security regulations.
Requirement 1: Subscription data shall be safeguarded against unapproved
disclosure or usage.
Requirement 2: Access to SuM data shall only be permitted in an authorized and
secure manner.
Requirement 3: Secure mechanisms shall be available for the transfer of SuM
data to, from or between authorized entities. The secure mechanisms to be
applied shall be appropriate to the level of confidentiality of the data, the
endpoints of the transfer and the routes that are available for the transfer
of the data.
Requirement 4: Audit records should be maintained for all SuM transactions to
facilitate resolution of security violations.
**SuM Information Model Requirements**
According to [80] the SuM information model aims to define all the data,
attributes and relations necessary for the provisioning of services for a
specific subscriber. In order to design this information model, it is
necessary to have a model that depicts all the actors and relationships
between them. Figure 5.1.5.1.3 .2 shows TISPAN\'s SuM model.
Figure 5.1.5.1.3.2: SuM Entity - Relationship Model according to TISPAN [25]
The new actors introduced within the SuM model are the following:
  * Service Profile: The **Service Profile** represents the set of > subscribed services associated to a user. many service profiles > may be associated to a user. This concept permit to establish a > link between a user and a set of services he/she is using.
  * Access Network: One subscription may be used across different > network accesses.
Within the SuM Model, one subscriber is linked to zero or several NGN
subscription, where one NGN subscription is associated to one and only one
subscriber.
A NGN subscription can be associated to zero or more physical access networks
(e.g. DSL, GPRS, etc), and the same physical access network may be used by
several NGN subscription.
Within one NGN subscription, a subscriber may give rights to zero or several
users. One user is associated to at least one subscriber. One user is
associated to at least one Subscription(s), and may be associated to several.
To access its services, users are requested to provide their associated
credentials. One user can have one or more credentials , while one credential
is associated to only one user.
A Service profile is a collection of service and user related data, and can be
associated to one or more users. One user may be associated to multiple
service profiles.
The architecture comprises the definition of all the necessary management
components and interfaces between (see also figure 5.1.5.1.3.3):
  * The CRM Order handling process and SM&O Service Configuration & > Activation process.
  * The SM&O Service Configuration & Activation process and RM&O > Resource Provisioning process.
  * The RM&O Resource Provisioning process and TISPAN NGN Network > functional entities including CPE and AS.

Figure 5.1.5.1.3.3: SuM Architectural Model according to TISPAN [25]
In [26] a first high level definition of an information model is given, which
will be further refined in upcoming version of the document:
**Subscriber**
The subscriber concept used in the present document is the same as the one
defined in [2]. It is not handled (stored or modified) in the TISPAN NGN
network nodes. The subscriber is not in the scope of [26], and is mentioned
for clearness and consistency purposes of the model.
**User**
  * A user is described by its characteristics/attributes, possibly > including various identifiers.
  * A user must be immutable and, therefore, independent of any > information that may change during the lifecycle of the user. In > particular, it must not depend on any service, any device, network > access, credential, etc.
  * A user may be associated with zero or more devices, network > accesses, credentials, contracts, etc.
  * In addition, the change of/in devices, network accesses, > credentials, contracts, etc. must not lead to a change of > identities.
  * A user is defined to be long lasting. Life cycle of a user identity > is independent of several aspects:
\- A user is not strictly bound to a particular contract subscription.
\- A user is independent from any device.
\- A user is independent from any network access.
**Credential**
A credential is a physical or data element that is used by user to establish a
claimed identity. Typical credentials include user names/passwords, SIM cards
or smart cards, network access numbers, biometrics, etc.
**Subscription**
The subscription describes the commercial relationship between the subscriber
and the service provider. It identifies a subscriber to one or more services.
The subscription is identified by a unique subscription identifier, which is
assigned by the information system and has no semantics with regard to the
service execution. It must be inserted in the call detail records generated by
the S-CSCF and Application Server.
The subscription identifier remains unchanged all along the service
subscription.
**Network Access**
The network access represents the physical entity that allows the user the
attachment to the network: IP address allocation. It can be of different
types: xDSL (where the typical access can be represented by a virtual circuit)
or GPRS (where the typical access can be represented by a PDP context).
**User Service Instance**
A user service instance is a commercial service provided (offer) to a customer
by a service provider. It is personalized if it is configured by the user. A
service from the products and service catalogue is associated with one or more
user services.
**Service Profile**
A **Service Profile** is possibly linked to a list of **Services** depending
on the service subscription. This list may change in the following cases:
  * The associated subscription account has requested new services or > resigned services.
  * The service operator has decided to add new services (e.g. for > marketing reasons).
  * The service operator has decided to restrict some services for any > reason.
According to [26] these entities are correlated the following way.
Figure 5.1.5.1.3.4: SuM Information Model according to TISPAN [26]
##### 5.1.5.1.5 OMA
[32] identifies a set of capabilities within the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)
as defined by 3GPP and 3GPP2 that can be utilized by the OMA service enablers.
Thus [32] also describes, which common interfaces exist between the IMS
architecture and the OMA service enabling architecture, so that OMA does not
have to define a duplicated set of capabilities for OMA service enablers,
rather these service enablers make use of the existing IMS architecture.
According to [32] subscriber data are stored on the HSS.
The Sh interface of provides the OMA service enabler with read and write
operations of user data related to IMS. It also provides the functionality for
subscription and notification of changes in the user data related to IMS.
**_The work item General Service Subscription Management (GSSM):_**
The objective of this work item [84] is to specify a general service
subscription management function in OSE, which is expected to cover management
of all services subscriptions within an operator/service provider\'s domain.
According to [84] the GSSM work item will address at least the following
features related to service subscription management:
  * Dynamic manipulation (add, update, remove, pause, resume) of service > subscription;
  * Service subscription provisioning, i.e. doing all the steps needed > in order to fulfil a service subscription request from a > subscriber);
  * Service subscription checking for requests by a subscriber for a > service application (or the reverse direction);
  * Definition of the service subscription models.
Two use cases shall be analysed specifically:
**Use case 1: Generating service subscription by request**
  * The subscriber should be able to change/update his/her service > subscription at any time and these changes/updates should be taken > into account as soon as they are performed.
  * The subscriber requests an update of his/her service subscription;
  * The GSSM updates the service subscription for the subscriber and > returns a response;
  * Further actions could be taken to handle the service subscription > update, e.g. notifying Applications or other entities, if needed; > Note that the response shown in the diagram below may not be > needed because often the GSSM will no know how to react on it.
**Use case 2: Checking service subscription**
Any other authorized enablers or entities should be able to check service
subscription. Before processing a service request from a requestor (an
application, a subscriber, or another enabler/entity), subscription related to
this service could be checked. One of the most likely components to make use
of this purpose is PEEM. This case corresponds to the PDP-PEP model defined by
IETF, where PEEM/other enablers are the PEP, and GSSM is the PDP that
delegates the service subscription evaluation.
  * The requestor sends a service request to PEEM (or a target > resource).
  * The PEEM (or the target resource) asks the GSSM whether the service > requests has a subscription.
  * GSSM checks the service subscription and finds that the service > subscription exists. The GSSM responds to PEEM (or the target > resource) with positive answer.
  * Processing of the service request can continue.
According to [84] the following external fora may be affected by this work
item:
  * TMF (TBD).
  * ETSI TISPAN (as they are investigating Subscription Management > (SuM)).
  * 3GPP:
\- HSS may be the storage of subscription information for some IMS services in
operator\'s networks; therefore the relationship of GSSM and HSS should be
studied and clarified; other affections to 3GPP are TBD.
\- 3GPP SA5 (as they are working on Subscription Management (SuM)).
According to [85], which specifies the requirements for GSSM, OMA supports the
following general service subscription concept:
Service subscription describes the commercial relationship between the
subscriber and operator/service provider. Service subscription is essential
for operators and service providers, since at least the following actions
would pertain to service subscription information:
  * Authorization for a subscription: by checking if a subscriber is > permitted to subscribe to a service.
  * Subscription validation: by checking if a subscriber is subscribed > to a service, operator/service provider can control if the > subscriber is allowed to access a service (subscriber-initiated > service), or if the service application is allowed to push a > content to a subscriber (application-initiated service).
  * Charging: service subscription is one of the major references for > charging.
Service subscription includes (among other pieces of information like service
customization and other subscription parameters) the service availability for
a subscriber (e.g. if the subscriber is subscribed to a WAP-based \"mobile
weather forecast\" service).
[85] aims to specify an enabler which decouples access to service subscription
from its actual representation and the location of the data by providing:
  * A single point of access to service subscription functions across > multiple instances of a service (e.g. multiple PoC servers).
  * A unique interface to service subscription functions across multiple > services (e.g. PoC, IM, etc.).
Up to now, the following use cases have been identified:
**_Service Subscription for Digital Newspaper Service_**
**Short Description**
A \"digital newspaper service\", provided to mobile network users in Beijing,
delivers news information including text, pictures, and short video clips to
subscribers of the service via MMS. James is an office staff working in
Beijing, and he would like to view some news for killing time when he is on
the way to his office by subway. He finds the digital newspaper service
complies with his requirement, and tries to subscribe to the service.
**Actors**
  * James, a mobile user of local mobile operator (acts as the > subscriber of the service).
  * BeijingMobileInfo.com, a Content Provider which owns the digital > newspaper service applications (act as the 3rd party Content > Provider of the service).
  * Mobile operator offering GSSM and a service portal (acts as Service > Provider).

A Mobile Operator has recognized that independent record companies do not
possess the subscription and charging infrastructure to offer music downloads
to their fans as a competitive rate. To satisfy this need, the Mobile Operator
has created an Indie Music Bundle service which allows fans of non-mainstream
music to download content from 50 independent record companies for a single
monthly fee based on a maximum number of track downloads per month.
Todd is a big fan of progressive thrash metal music and is frustrated by the
lack of this genre on the major music download sites. He wants better value
for his download dollar than the price per track rate and more variety than
that provided by a single record company. He decides the Indie Music Bundle
meets his needs and subscribes to the service level offering 10 tracks per
month for \$4.99.

**_Service Subscription for Groups_**
**Short Description**
A \"digital newspaper service\", provided to mobile network users in Beijing,
delivers news information including text, pictures, and short video clips to
subscribers of the service via MMS. Alice and Bob are the office staffs
working for the same corporation in Beijing. John is the manager of the
corporation and he would like to provide his staffs the welfare of viewing
some news for killing time when they are on the way to their office by subway.
John registered a Group to include Alice and Bob. He subscribed the digital
newspaper service for his group and every morning a multimedia message
containing up-to-time news is sent to the devices of users in John\'s group,
namely to Alice and Bob. When they are on the subway they can open the
messages and view the news.

##### 5.1.5.1.6 TMF
The NGOSS as described in [98] focuses on the specification of contracts.
These represent a central concept, as they provide interfaces to NGOSS
components. A component is a container of one of the two following types of
contract:
  * Contracts, which represent the value-added service of the component.
  * Contract used to manage the service itself.
A component must support at least one contract; in the case of a customer care
end-to-end application it will most probably support a larger amount of
contracts.
For a more detailed introduction to TMF\'s concepts see clause 5.1.5.5.3. This
clause deals with the definition of the notion \"contract\" within NGOSS [x41,
x42].
Basically TMF uses UML as definition method for their NGOSS meta-model, with
the addition of:
  * New model elements:
\- Contract:
Figure 5.1.5.1.6.1: NGOSS Contract Model [95]
In TMF, the contract is the fundamental unit of interoperability for an NGOSS
system.
  * Defines the specification of a service to be delivered.
  * Specifies information and code for the service of the bullet above.
  * Used to monitor, maintain and administer the respective service.
  * Has to ensure that external obligations (e.g. from SLAs) are > honoured and define reactions in case of violations.
  * Defines how a service is to be used (e.g. invoked):
\- Defines pre- and post conditions.
\- Semantics for using the service.
\- Policies affecting the configuration.
\- Use and operation of the service.
The functionality specified by a contract is seen differently by the different
constituencies:
  * Business view: specifies the high-level goals and obligations that a > resource and/or service must fulfil.
  * System View: specifies the architectural requirements necessary to > design the contract as defined by the business view.
  * Implementation view: defines configuration, programming and other > factors of the components, which provide the functionality defined > by the contract.
  * Deployment View: provides means for:
\- Monitoring the costs.
\- Monitoring the performance.
\- Monitoring all other aspects delivered by a component.
\- Administering the contract to enable the contract\'s activation and
deactivation.
\- NGOSS Component: represents a standard way to package NGOSS functionality.
It needs to:
  * know about; and
  * be able to use NGOSS contracts.
\- NGOSS Shared Information: designed to be inherently shareable and reusable
between NGOSS components. It needs to:
  * know about; and
  * be able to use NGOSS contracts.
\- NGOSS Identifier: represents a standard way to uniquely identify an NGOSS
element.
Figure 5.1.5.1.6.2: NGOSS Identifier [95]
The figure only shows the two most important attributes of NGOSS Identifier;
  * tnaVersion: contains the specific version number of the NGOSS > identifier.
  * authority: name of the authority, which defined the entity that this > class identifies.
\- NGOSS Policy: represents a standardized way to control NGOSS components and
processes.
\- NGOSS Interaction: represents the interaction of different managed elements
and thus determines the behaviour of NGOSS systems.
\- Termination: used in the definition of NGOSS Contract operations.
\- NGOSS Extensible Element.
  * New information entities.
  * New data types.
According to [96] the basic NGOSS contract description is composed of five
parts:
  * General Contract Part:
\- Header Part: identifies the contract in an unambiguous way:
  * Contract Name.
  * Contract Identifier.
  * Version.
  * Contract Defining Organization.
\- Descriptive Part: contains the goal of the contract and some search
criteria:
  * Goal.
  * Description.
  * Comment.

\- Functional Part: defines the capabilities provided by the contract:
  * Associated Business Process.
  * Associated Business Policies.
  * Business Capabilities.
  * Preconditions.
  * Result Status.
  * Post-Conditions resulting from correct operation.
  * Interaction Points.
  * Interaction Roles.
  * Security.
  * Context for the capabilities.
\- Non Functional Part: defines aspects, which pose boundary conditions for
the operation of the capabilities defined in the contract:
  * Deployment related fields:
\- Availability limitations.
\- Safety limitations.
  * Organization related fields
\- Business environment.
\- Organizational limitations.
\- Market limitations.
\- Financial limitations.
  * Legal related fields
\- Regulatory limitations.
\- Legal limitations.
  * Miscellaneous fields
\- Stakeholders.
\- Assumptions.
\- Offering periods.
\- Management Part: defines the management capabilities necessary to
administer and maintain the capabilities of the contract:
  * Management Activities.
  * Reponsible Management Roles.
  * Associated Management processes.
  * Associated Management policies.
  * Management Security Policies.
\- View Specific Model Part: contains the model types (UML and others)
necessary to support the specific view of the contract requested.

  * Associated System Processes.
  * Associated System Policies.
  * System Capabilities:
\- Input Entities.
\- Output Entities.

  * Installation Policy ID
  * Deployment Policy ID
  * Monitor Policy ID
  * Removal Policy ID
\- View Specific Model Part: contains the model types (UML and others)
necessary to support the specific view of the contract requested.
Fundamental to NGOSS based systems [98] is also the concept of a Shared
Information Datamodel (SID) [99]. There, amongst other data, Service Level
Agreements and Customer Details are defined.
The detailed model of a customer can be found in [100]:
  * Customer: Person or organization, which obtains products and > services from the enterprise or receives free offers for services. > This business entity has the following attributes:
\- customerId: unique identifier (mandatory);
\- customerStatus: current condition of a customer - active, inactive,
prospective (mandatory);
\- customerRank: degree of importance relative to other customers (optional).
  * CustomerCreditProfile: Outline of a customer\'s credit worthiness:
\- creditProfileId: Identifier of the credit profile;
\- creditProfileDate: Date of establishment;
\- validFor: The period for which the profile is valid.

produced;
\- validFor: time period fro which the billing cycle is applicable.
  * CustomerAccountContact: an individual or organization used as > contact point for a customer account and accessed via some contact > medium:

Figure 5.1.5.1.6.3: TMF SID Customer [100]
Associated with the customer is the customer\'s order. [100] defines the
following business entities:

\- assignedPriority: the order\'s assigned priorityafter review;
\- assignedResponsibilityRank: target response date after review.

#### 5.1.5.2 Statistics
##### 5.1.5.2.1 ITU-T
In [94] ITU-T describes its management philosophy and lists the tasks for each
of the management layers it defines. ITU-T does so by identifying functions
and function sets.
The following function sets from the Performance Management (PM) area deal
with the end-user, who is called customer and subscriber interchangeably in
[94].
  * Performance Quality Assurance: supports decision processes that > establish, as the state-of-the-art expands and customer needs > change, the quality measures that are appropriate to the area of > (PM).
\- Subscriber service quality criteria function set: This set provides a
network management query feature for offering Performance Management
information to a customer, such as grades of service options, performance
monitoring thresholds, or the possible conditions under which rebates are
awarded when service quality goals are not met.
\- QoS performance assessment function set: This set provides access to the
assessment summary of all combined QoS performance measures, by area, by type
of customer, by type of service and by network components, that compares
measured quality with the quality goals.
  * Performance Monitoring: Performance Monitoring involves the > continuous collection of data concerning the performance of > specific network elements.
Performance monitoring is designed to measure the overall quality, using
monitored parameters in order to detect such degradation. It may also be
designed to detect characteristic patterns of impairment before signal quality
has dropped below an acceptable level.
\- Performance monitoring policy function set: This set establishes
Performance Monitoring policy such as the values of threshold settings and
schedules for data collection for specific kinds of circuits. These settings
are to be applied during activation of such circuits. Different policies are
likely to be created for special service circuits of various kinds, for
message circuits, and for facilities.
  * Set PM trend analysis pattern: Manager directs the agent to assign > designated values to a PM trend analysis pattern. A PM trend > analysis pattern is a set of parameters of an algorithm that > analyses raw PM data from a monitoring point and characterizes the > data as (for example) increasing in severity over time or cyclic > or associated with service customer activity.
  * Performance Analysis: Performance data may require additional > processing and analysis in order to evaluate the performance level > of the entity.
\- Customer service performance summary function set: This set supports the
generation of reports on summaries of measurements for the purpose of
evaluating the performance of a particular transport service or group of
services. The customer can be provided access to the summary in order to
verify that guaranteed service levels have been met, or to enable the customer
to evaluate their own networks.
\- Customer traffic performance summary function set: This set provides access
to a scheduled or exception report of offered traffic, usage and measures of
congestion on a leased circuit, a group of leased circuits, a hunt group, or a
leased physical or virtual network.
##### 5.1.5.2.2 3GPP
Following [60] any evaluation of 3G-system behaviour requires performance data
collected and recorded by its NEs according to a schedule established by the
EM. This aspect of the management environment is termed Performance
Management.
The purpose of any Performance Management activity is to collect data, which
can be used to verify the physical and logical configuration of the network
and to locate potential problems as early as possible. The type of data to be
collected is defined by the equivalent measurements. This clause describes the
requirements of 3G-telecom management to produce this data.
Data is required to be produced by the NEs to support the following areas of
performance evaluation:
  * Traffic levels within the network, including the level of both:
\- the user traffic; and
\- the signalling traffic;
The following traffic types are evaluated:
\- traffic load on the radio interface (signalling and user traffic);
\- usage of resources within the network nodes;
\- user activation and use of supplementary services, etc.
  * Verification of the network configuration: Once a network plan, or > changes to a network plan, have been implemented it is important > to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan or planned > changes. Typically, the measurements required to support this > activity indicate the traffic levels with particular relevance to > the way the traffic uses the network.
  * Resource access measurements: For accurate evaluation of resource > access, each measurement result would need to be produced for > regular time intervals across the network, or for a comparable > part of the network.
  * Quality of Service: The user of a 3G system views the provided > service from outside the network. That perception can be described > in observed QoS terms. QoS can indicate the network performance > expected to be experienced by the user. For further detail see > ITU-T Recommendation E.880. Examples are delays during call > set-up, packet throughput, etc.
  * resource availability: The availability performance is dependent on > the defined objectives, i.e. the availability performance > activities carried out during the different phases of the life > cycle of the system, and on the physical and administrative > conditions. For further detail see ITU-T Recommendation E.880. > Examples are the recording of begin and end times of service > unavailability).
The production of the measurement data by the NEs also needs to be
administered by the EM. Several phases of administration of performance
measurements can be distinguished:
  * management of the performance measurement collection process: The > administration of measurement jobs by the EM comprises the > following actions:
\- Create/delete a measurement job.
\- Modifying a measurement job, i.e. changing the parameters (specifically the
schedule) of a measurement job that has been previously created.
\- Definition of measurement job scheduling.
\- Suspend/resume a measurement job.
\- Setting up the requirements for the reporting and routing of results to one
or more OSs (EM and/or NM). For the NM, this is limited to the control of the
result file transfer.
Retrieval of information related to measurement jobs, i.e. view the current
measurement job definition.
  * generation of performance measurement results: The measurement data > can be collected in each NE of the network in a number of ways:
\- cumulative incremental counters triggered by the occurrence of the measured
event;
\- status inspection (i.e. a mechanism for high frequency sampling of internal
counters at pre-defined rates);
\- gauges (i.e. high tide mark, low tide mark);
\- discrete event registration, where data related to a particular event is
captured.
  * local storage of measurement results in the NE: It shall be possible > for the NE to retain measurement data it has produced for deferred > retrieval by the OS(s). This data will be retained at the NE under > the control of the EM. The storage capacity and the duration for > which the data will be retained at the NE will be Operator and > implementation dependent.
  * transfer of measurement results from the NE to an OS: The results of > the measurement job can be forwarded to the EM in either of two > standard ways:
\- the scheduled result reports generated by the NE (notifications) can be
sent to the EM as soon as they are available;
\- the reports can be stored in the NE (files) and transferred to or retrieved
by the EM when required.
It shall be possible for the EM to specify the details for its result
retrieval as a part of the measurement administration.
  * storage, preparation and presentation of results to the operating > personnel.
#### 5.1.5.3 Charging Management
The main requirements and high-level principles for charging have been listed
in clause 5.1.2.6.3 based on 3GPP TS 22.115 [48].
Several logical charging functions are needed in the network together with the
reference points that are used to transfer charging information between those
functions.
It has already been stated in clause 5 that the domains (e.g. PS), services
(e.g. MMS) and subsystems (e.g. the IMS) affect the way in which the charging
functions are embedded. However, as the functional requirements for charging
are always the same, 3GPP defines a common approach for the definition of the
logical charging functions, resulting in a logical charging architecture for
all GSM and UMTS network domains, subsystems and services that are relevant
for charging standardization (see figure 5.1.5.3.1).
Figure 5.1.5.3.1: 3GPP Charging Management Architecture [47]
The logical functions and the reference points indicated in figure 5.1.5.3.1
will be treated separately for online and offline charging in the next
clauses.
##### 5.1.5.3.1 Offline Charging
##### 5.1.5.3.1.1 3GPP {#gpp-12 .H6}
According to [47] charging information for network resource usage is collected
concurrently with that resource usage. The charging information is then passed
through a chain of logical charging functions (see below). Then CDR files are
generated by the network and transferred to the network operator\'s Billing
Domain for the purpose of subscriber billing and/or inter-operator accounting.
The BD can comprise post-processing systems such as the operator\'s billing
system or billing mediation device.
**NOTE: Offline charging is a** mechanism which **does not** affect, in real-
time, the service rendered.
The following figure 5.1.5.3.1.1.1 [47] depicts:
  * the logical charging functions as well as;
  * the reference points between these functions and to the Billing > Domain.
Figure 5.1.5.3.1.1.1: 3GPP Offline Charging functions and reference points
[47]
  * Charging Trigger Function (CTF): generates charging events based on > the observation of network resource usage. The CTF is the focal > point for collecting the information pertaining to chargeable > events within the network element, assembling this information > into matching charging events, and sending these charging events > towards the Charging Data Function. The CTF is therefore a > mandatory, integrated component in all network elements that > provide offline charging functionality, as depicted in the figure > above. It is made up of two functional blocks:
\- Accounting Metrics Collection: It is required to provide metrics that
identify the user and the user\'s consumption of network resources and/or
services in real-time. The exact behaviour and functionality of this process
e.g.:
  * trigger conditions for collection of charging information;
  * information elements to collect;
  * which service events, signalling or user traffic to monitor;
  * relationship to services / bearers / sessions;
  * depends on functions / services that the NE provides.
\- Accounting Data Forwarding: This process:
  * receives the collected accounting metrics;
  * determines the occurrence of chargeable events from a set of one or > more of these metrics;
  * assembles charging events that match the detected chargeable events; > and
  * forwards the charging events towards the Charging Data Function via > the Rf reference point.
The charging events provide information pertinent to the chargeable event,
i.e. characterizing the network resource usage together with an identification
of the involved user(s).
  * Charging Data Function (CDF): receives charging events from the > Charging Trigger Function via the Rf reference point. It then uses > the information contained in the charging events to construct > CDRs.
The results of the CDF tasks are charging data records (CDRs) with a well-
defined content and format. The content and format of these CDRs are specified
per domain / subsystem / service in the related middle tier charging
specification (e.g. 3GPP TS 32.250 for the CS domain and 3GPP TS 32.251 [111]
for the PS domain, etc.).
  * Charging Gateway Function (CGF): receives the CDRs produced by the > CDF immediately via the Ga reference point. The CGF acts as a > gateway between the 3GPP network and the Billing Domain. It uses > the Bx reference point for the transfer of CDR files to the BD. > The entity relationship between the CDF and the CGF is m:1, > i.e. one or more CDFs may feed CDRs into a single CGF.
##### 5.1.5.3.2 Online Charging
##### 5.1.5.3.2.1 3GPP {#gpp-13 .H6}
According to [47] charging information for network resource usage is collected
concurrently with that resource usage in the same fashion as in offline
charging. In contrast to offline charging however, authorization for the
network resource usage must be obtained by the network prior to the actual
resource usage to occur. This authorization is granted by the Online Charging
System upon request from the network.
When receiving a network resource usage request, the network assembles the
relevant charging information and generates a charging event towards the OCS
in real-time. The OCS then returns an appropriate resource usage
authorization. The resource usage authorization may be limited in its scope
(e.g. volume of data or duration), therefore the authorization may have to be
renewed from time to time as long as the user\'s network resource usage
persists.
NOTE: **Online charging is a** mechanism where charging information can
affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction
of the charging mechanism with the control of network resource usage is
required.
The following figure 5.1.5.3.1.1.2 [47] depicts:
  * the logical charging functions as well as;
  * the reference points between these functions and to the Billing > Domain.
Figure 5.1.5.3.1.1.2: 3GPP Online Charging functions and reference points [47]
  * CTF: Online charging is a process where charging information is > collected in the network element in the same fashion as in offline > charging. This implies that, from the functional perspective, the > CTF defined in the clause above also creates the charging events > used for online charging. While the accounting metrics used in > online charging are generally the same as in offline charging > (i.e. the charging mechanism is transparent to the Accounting > Metrics Collection), there are some important functional > enhancements concerning the Accounting Data Forwarding are > required in the CTF in order to support online charging (see > [47] for details).
  * Online Charging System (OCS):
\- The Online Charging Function (OCF): consists of two distinct modules:
  * Session Based Charging Function (SBCF): responsible for online > charging of network / user sessions, e.g. voice calls, GPRS PDP > contexts or IMS sessions.
  * Event Based Charging Function (EBCF): performs event-based online > charging (also referred to as \"content charging\") in conjunction > with any application server or service NE, including SIP > application servers.
\- S-CSCF online charging / IMS Gateway Function: the S-CSCF does not trigger
any online charging events and thus does not include the CTF online charging
enhancements already mentioned. Instead, the ISC interface is employed by the
S-CSCF online charging, implying that online charging is transparent to the
S-CSCF and appears like any other service controlled by a SIP application
server. Therefore, if support for Ro based online charging is required, a
special CTF is needed in order to mediate between the Ro based SBCF and the
SIP based service control. This role is taken by the IMS Gateway Function (IMS
GWF), which translates between SIP service control towards the S-CSCF and Ro
credit control on the OCS side.
  * Rating Function (RF): determines the value of the network resource > usage (described in the charging event received by the OCF from > the network) on behalf of the OCF. To this end, the OCF furnishes > the necessary information, obtained from the charging event, to > the RF and receives in return the rating output (monetary or > non-monetary units), via the Re reference point. The RF may handle > a wide variety of rateable instances, such as:
\- Rating of data volume (e.g. based on charging initiated by an access
network entity, i.e. on the bearer level).
\- Rating of session / connection time (e.g. based on charging initiated by a
SIP application, i.e. on the subsystem level).
\- Rating of service events (e.g. based on charging of web content or MMS,
i.e. on the service level).
  * Account Balance Management Function (ABMF): location of the > subscriber\'s account balance within the OCS.
#### 5.1.5.4 Billing
##### 5.1.5.4.2.1 3GPP
In offline charging (see [47]) the internal functions of the BD are outside
the scope of 3GPP standardization. The reference point for the charging
information transfer from the network to the BD forms part of the 3GPP
standards.
In online charging (see [47]), the charging information is transferred from
the network to the Online Charging System (OCS). The OCS, in turn, may have an
offline charging reference point used to forward charging information to the
BD. This BD is similar in scope and intent to the offline charging case.
#### 5.1.5.5 System Management
##### 5.1.5.5.1 ITU-T
In [94] ITU-T describes its management philosophy and lists the tasks for each
of the management layers it defines. ITU-T does so by identifying functions
and function sets.
The following function sets from the fault management (FM) area deal with the
end-user, who is called customer and subscriber interchangeably in [94].
According to [94] Fault Management enables the detection, isolation and
correction of abnormal operation of the telecommunication network and its
environment. It provides facilities for the performance of the maintenance
phases from ITU-T Recommendation M.20 [112]. The quality assurance
measurements for Fault Management include component measurements for
Reliability, Availability and Survivability (RAS).
  * RAS Quality Assurance: RAS Quality Assurance establishes the > reliability criteria, which guide the design policy for redundant > equipment (a responsibility of Configuration Management), and the > policies of the other function groups in this area:
\- Service outage reporting function set: This set provides access to a
database of outage reports concerning an outage of services to multiple
customers. The report may include the type of services affected, the number of
customers affected, and the start and end times of the outage. Such reports
include statistics concerning service outages by designated areas and over
designated periods of time.
  * Fault Localization: Where the initial failure information is > insufficient for fault localization, it has to be augmented with > information obtained by additional failure localization routines.
\- Network fault localization function set: The process to determine faults
starts with the information received by status management from the network
(e.g. alarm report, user message from customer, real-time status report by N/W
carriers, etc). Based on the fault information received, the trouble ticket is
opened by ticket management and consolidated with the related trouble ticket.
Event management will analyse the fault report, and there are four
opportunities for reaching the next status: diagnosed, help required,
suspended or went away.
After successful diagnosis, the problem will be \"repaired\", and the trouble
ticket may be closed. Otherwise, the problem may be reselected. Problems,
which disappear or are suspended, or when their time expires, may be changed
to an \"expired\" status. After the problem is determined, the problem message
is sent to the customer, for instance, outage equipment.
  * Fault Correction: Fault Correction transfers data concerning the > repair of a fault and for the control of procedures that use > redundant resources to replace equipment or facilities that have > failed.
\- Arrangement of repair with customer function set: This set supports
contacting a customer to schedule dispatch to customer premises.
##### 5.1.5.5.2 3GPP
[113] describes the requirements and information model necessary for the
Telecommunication Management (TM) of 3G systems. It treats a 3G system as a
multitude of Network Elements (NE) of various types and, typically, different
vendors, which inter-operate in a co-ordinated manner in order to satisfy the
network users\' communication requirements. [113] consists of two parts, an NE
management part and a system management part.
_NE Management Part_
The occurrence of failures in an NE may cause a deterioration of this NE\'s
function and/or service quality and in order to minimize the effects of such
failures on the Quality of Service (QOS) as perceived by the network users it
is necessary to:
  * detect failures in the network as soon as they occur and alert the operating personnel as fast as possible;
  * isolate the failures (autonomously or through operator intervention), i.e. switch off faulty units and, if applicable, limit the effect of the failure as much as possible by reconfiguration of the faulty NE/adjacent NEs;
  * if necessary, determine the cause of the failure using diagnosis and test routines; and,
  * repair/eliminate failures in due time through the application of maintenance procedures.
According to [113] this aspect of the management environment is termed \"Fault
Management\" (FM). Its purpose is to detect failures as soon as they occur and
to limit their effects on the network Quality of Service (QOS) as far as
possible.
Fault Management (FM) encompasses all of the above functionalities except
commissioning/decommissioning of NEs and potential operator triggered
reconfiguration (these are a matter of Configuration Management).
FM also includes associated features in the Operations System (OS), such as
the administration of a pending alarms list, the presentation of operational
state information of physical and logical devices/resources/functions, and the
provision and analysis of the alarm and state history of the network.
_Network Management Part_
An operations system on the network management layer (i.e. the NM) provides
fault management services and functions required by the 3G operator on top of
the element management layer.
The N interface (Itf-N) may connect the Network Management (NM) system either
  * to Element Mangers (EMs) or
  * directly to the Network Elements (NEs)
by means of Integration Reference Points (IRPs).
In [113] the term \"subordinate entities\" defines either EMs or NEs, which
are in charge of supporting the N interface.
The following paragraphs describe the properties of an interface enabling a NM
to supervise a 3G-telecommunication network. To provide to the NM the Fault
Management capability for the network implies that the subordinate entities
have to provide information about:
  * events and failures occurring in the subordinate entities;
  * events and failures of the connections towards the subordinate entities and also of the connections within the 3G network;
  * the network configuration (due to the fact that alarms and related state change information are always originated by network resources, see 3GPP TS 32.600-series [1]). This is, however, not part of the FM functionality.
Therefore, for the purpose of FM the subordinate entities send notifications
to a NM indicating:
  * alarm reports (indicating the occurrence or the clearing of failures > within the subordinate entities), so that the related alarm > information can be updated;
  * state change event reports, so that the related (operational) state > information can be updated. This is, however, not part of the FM > functionality.
The forwarding of these notifications is controlled by the NM operator using
adequate filtering mechanisms within the subordinate entities.
The Itf-N provides also means to allow the NM operator the storage
(\"logging\") and the later evaluation of desired information within the
subordinate entities.
The retrieval capability of alarm-related information concerns two aspects:
  * retrieval of \"dynamic\" information (e.g. alarms, states), which describes the momentary alarm condition in the subordinate entities and allows the NM operator a synchronization of its alarm overview data;
  * retrieval of \"history\" information from the logs (e.g. active/clear alarms and state changes occurred in the past), which allows the evaluation of events that may have been lost, e.g. after an Itf-N interface failure or a system recovery.
As a consequence of the requirements described above, both the NM and the
subordinate entity shall be able to initiate the communication.
##### 5.1.5.5.3 TMF
This subsection gives a general overview of the network management philosophy
according to TMF and how its meta data is structured. This is intended as
supplementary information to section 5.1.5.1.6.
As described in [98] TMF's architecture is based on a distributed and
interface oriented architecture. The basic entity is the interface and any
running system (composed of runtime entities) makes use of (supports) some
these interfaces. The runtime entities are composed of components, which are
organized into models.
A software component [98] merges two perspectives:
  * the component as an implementation: can be deployed and assembled into larger subsystems
  * the component as an architectural abstraction: express design rules that impose a standard coordination model on all components
In order to arrive at a component model and a component framework [98] defines
the following notions:
  * component interface: coherent set of functional capabilities (attributes and operations)
  * role: expected behaviour pattern of an agent in an interaction
  * component model:
    * specifies the design rules, which must be obeyed by components
    * describes how components can be composed into larger assemblies (components again)
    * defines the external visibility of a component
  * component framework: provides the services and mechanisms to support and enforce a component model
One of the most important points in TMF's network management definition is the
distinction between
  * technology independent concepts (leading to a Technology Neutral Architecture -- TNA) and
  * concepts specific to one or more technologies (leading to Technology Specific Architectures -- TSA)
The software entities of an NGOSS system [98], which provide services to other
entities do so via interfaces, which characterize the services with the
following properties:
  * A description of the service in terms of
    * The meta data used to describe the interface
    * The meta data used o describe the operations that may be invoked on the service
    * The set of results, which may be returned upon invocation of an operation
  * The behaviour of the service (optional):
    * Preconditions under which an operation may be invoked
    * Postconditions definig the state a system is left in for each response of an invoked operation.
  * The service must be manageable independently
Telemanagement Forum defines the following types of services:
  * Basic Framework services: needed to support Application Domains (e.g. registration, Naming Location)
  * OSS Framework Services: services to support any type of distributed OSS on the chosen NGOSS component model
  * OSS Application Services: services specific to a Service Provider's environment (e.g. Fault Management, Billing)
One means to develop standard NGOSS solutions according to TM Forum is by
applying the eTOM (enhanced Telecom Operations Map) developed by the TM Forum.
It provides a business operations framework , which characterizes all the
business activities a Service Provider will use.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="5.354861111111111in"}It should be noted
that eTOM has many single-enterprise aspects, but it has been recognized that
for a business-to-business approach enterprise external aspects have to be
taken into account as well.
Figure 5.1.5.5.3.1: The Fulfillment process flow according to [115]
The eTOM concept is developed in different levels, each level providing more
detail concerning the processes involved.
_Level 0 -- Conceptual View_
The eTOM has three major process areas:
  * Strategy, Infrastructure and Product: this bullet covers planning and life cycle management
  * Operations: this bullet covers the core of operational management
  * Enterprise Management: this bullet covers corporate or business management
In addition eTOM identifies four key functional process structures (horizontal
rectangles in the figure above).
  * Market, Product and Customer processes: processes concerning sales and channel management as well as marketing
  * Service Processes: service development, service delivery, service configuration, service problem management, quality analysis, rating
  * Resource Processes: development and delivery of resource infrastructure and its operational management
  * Supplier/Partner Processes: deal with the interaction of the enterprise with its suppliers and partners.
Finally eTOM defines who interacts with the enterprise:
  * Customers: to whom the products of the enterprise are sold
  * Suppliers: provide resources or other capabilities
  * Partners: operate with the enterprise in a shared area of business
  * Employees: work for the enterprise
  * Shareholders: have invested in the enterprise
  * Stakeholders: have commitment to the enterprise other than through stock ownership
_Level 1 -- CxO View_
There the eTOM is decomposed into a set of level 1 process groupings. One
topic, dealt with in eTOM is Fulfillment. In [115] selected process flows are
discussed. Figure 5.1.5.5.3.1 shows TMF's scenario for DSL end-to-end
Fulfilment flows in their context with the overall eTOM level 1 model.
The figure has to be read under the following assumptions:
  * There is limited pre-provisioning of infrastructure to end-users
  * Part of the resources will be provided internally, part from external sources (e.g. an incumbent carrier provides the local loop)
  * Multiple external suppliers are considered for the necessary external resources
  * The service has moderate complexity
Most of the high level process linkages are within the level 1 Fulfilment
process group, but still some interactions can be identified outside this
vertical process area.
#### 5.1.5.6 Personal Network Management (PNM)
##### 5.1.5.6.1 3GPP
3GPP states in [86] that PNM provides a service to manage the Personal Network
(PN) of a user comprising a number of registered UEs and PANs. That is, one
user may possess more than one device to run multiple services. These devices
have different capabilities which qualify the devices for specific
applications.
Personal UE Networks and PNE (Personal Network Element) Networks are two
scenarios for PNM. Personal UE Network enables the management of multiple UEs
belonging to a single user. The functionality enabled is shown in figure
5.1.3.9.1.
{width="6.0159722222222225in" height="3.1354166666666665in"}
Figure 5.1.3.9.1: UEs managed by PNM e.g. UE Redirecting Service[86]
PNE Networks enable functions for the management and direct accessibility of
the physically separated components of a UE, i.e. TEs and MEs. PNE Network
functions comprise the management and communication of these PNEs within a PN
including the redirection to UE and PAN (Personal Area Network) component.
Figure 5.1.3.9.1a illustrates the management of UE(s), UE components and
TE(s), ME(s) or MT(s) and belonging to the same PAN(s).
{width="6.516666666666667in" height="3.5118055555555556in"}
Figure 5.1.3.9.1a: Devices addressed by PAN Management
Personal UE Networks and PNE Networks both provides two services: Redirecting
service and Private Network service. Redirection service is to redirect
terminating services to selected UEs or physically separated UE components,
while Private Network service is to maintain privacy and enable restricted
access to a PN.
Figures 5.1.3.9.2 and 5.1.3.9.3 illustrate how PNM UE Redirecting Service
integrates into the 3GPP architecture, including IMS architecture and CS
domain architecture.
Figure 5.1.3.9.2: IMS architecture of the PNM UE Redirecting Service[61]
Figure 5.1.3.9.3: CS domain architecture of the PNM UE Redirecting Service[61]
The following user data may be stored and managed by PNM service:
  * Public User Identity.
  * Private User Identity.
  * IMSI.
  * PNE Identifier: is the PNE Identifier uniquely identifies each PNE > of a PN within the PN. The PNE Identifier of MTs and MEs is the > IMEI. Other PNEs have PNM-specific identifiers that are allocated > for enabling PNM functions.
  * The identity of PNM network.

## 5.3 Basics of a Common User Data Model
### 5.3.1 Characteristics of an End-User
This section deals with issues coming up, when a common user data model should
be built. The word "user" is meant here in the sense of an end-user as the
human being, who
  * **uses certain services,**
  * **enjoys certain privileges and**
  * **has certain preferences.**
The first intention is to
  * **give a short classification of the data, which might at some time be put into the end-user data model,**
  * **then look at those attributes, which will in some way represent primary keys within an end-user database and analyse, which interdependencies there might be and**
  * **finally define, which attributes are the same in different network functions or management applications introduced in the section above.**
The second intention is to relate the concept of an end-user, as it is
described in this section to the concept of a subscriber (here also "contract
holder"), which is the one used and known today.
The third intention of this section is to show, how the building blocks of an
Adaptation Layer can help in bringing many network functions on top of a
centralized end-user data store.
Note: It is not the intention of this section to provide a "complete" schema
definition on the basis of all data collected in the section above.
#### 5.3.1.1 Types of Data Assigned to an End-User
In the section above - which introduced many of the relevant network functions
and management applications that could profit from and contribute to a common
data model - the end-user data description was generally structured according
to the type of service the data in question represented. This subsection
introduces additional criteria, according to which data can be classified:
  * **Operator's point of view: One distinction, which is important for an operator, is the fact whether the stored data are relevant for call-setup/processing or not.**
  * **Characterization via identities: An end-user can be characterized by primary keys like an IMSI, MSISDN, Puiblic ID, Private ID, PIN, ....**
  * **Characterization of an end-user versus a contract holder (in 3GPP called subscriber): Here the question is addressed, which data characterize someone, who uses a service versus someone, who is subscribed to this service.**
Seen from the point of view of an operator, an end-user can have three
different types of data:
  * Profile data: These are data characterizing the services assigned to the end-user (these are mainly the data described in the first section of this document),
  * his privileges and
  * his preferences.
```{=html}
``` \- [Completely private data:]{.underline} These are data stored by the
end-user and only seen by him or her**(e.g. digital pictures)**.
  * [Private data influencing the call processing:]{.underline} These are data, which are also privately owned by the end-user, but will influence the way services are executed (e.g. private e-mail distribution list).
#### 5.3.1.2 The Identity of an End-User
##### 5.3.1.2.1 The UID
This clause highlights the relationship between an end-user, his identities
and a contract holder. Please note that the results presented in this
subsection are not yet standardized and are intended as suggestions as a way
forward for any standardization efforts on the topic of an end-user centric
data model.
The general idea is to have an object model entity called UID (user
identification), which represents the root for the whole end-user model. As an
example for a key the entity IMSI is shown in a 1:n relationship with the UID.
This relationship expresses the fact that an end-user can have n end-user
equipments providing some types of telephony or data services. In addition the
end-user is using services, which someone -- the contract holder or subscriber
-- must have subscribed to, In this case there is an n:m relation between the
UID and the contract holder (e.g. the end-user has one end-user equipment plus
subscription from his company and another UE plus services is subscribed by
himself). As a consequence there is a third relation, namely the one between
the contract holder and the respective identity, which, in case of the IMSI
represents subscription information. This relation will be 1:m.
The figure below shows the relation between the UID, the contract holder and
the IMSI in an UML diagram.

Figure 5.3.1.2.1.1: General Picture of the relationship between an end-user
and a contract holder
In the next clause the relation of the end-user to his various key attributes
will be discussed in detail. Finally this subsection will treat an example,
which shows the connection between an end-user and a subscriber in more
detail.
##### 5.3.1.2.2 Representation of the Identity of the End-User through his
Keys
Depending on the service used by the end-user, identification of the same
might be achieved by different keys (examples of which can be found in [2],
[3]): IMSI, MSISDN, Public Key, Private Key, etc. Each of these keys describes
part of the identity of the end-user. In order to identify an end-user
completely and uniquely the relations between these different keys and the UID
have to be defined.
{width="5.518055555555556in" height="3.94375in"}
Figure 5.3.1.2.2.1: Characterization of one end-user
In clause 5.3.1.3 the relation between an end user and a subscriber has been
described. Further more, the relation among the identities belonging to an end
user should be considered. The relation should make the deployment and billing
of end user oriented services easy.
**Figure 5.3.1.2.2.2: The relation among the identities of an end-user**
Figure 5.3.1.2.2.2 shows the relationship among the identities of an end user:
an end user (with his UID) has several private and public identities related
to different services. In order to identify the information of co-located USIM
and ISIM, as mentioned in the motivation statement 2 and 3 in the clause 4.1,
there should be association between IMSI and IMPIs or/and between MSISDN and
IMPUs. Meanwhile, the association between IMPUs and MSISDNs could help
operator to provide users conbined services spanning CS, PS and IMS.
In the 3GPP area [3] the following partial identities of an end-user have been
defined:
_Identification of subscribers:_
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI): unique, shall be allocated to
each mobile subscriber in the GSM/UMTS system.
Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identities (TMSI): may be allocated by the VLRs
and SGSNs to visiting mobile subscribers in order to support the subscriber
identity confidentiality service. The VLR and SGSNs must be capable of
correlating an allocated TMSI with the IMSI of the MS to which it is
allocated.
P-TMSI: An MS may be allocated two TMSIs, one for services provided through
the MSC, and the other (P-TMSI) for services provided through the SGSN.
Temporary Logical Link Identity (TLLI): used for addressing on resources used
for GPRS. The TLLI to use is built by the MS
  * **either on the basis of the P-TMSI (local or foreign TLLI),**
  * **or directly (random TLLI).**
Local Mobile Station Identity (LMSI): defined in order to speed up the search
for subscriber data in the VLR.

Figure 5.3.1.2.2.3: Temporary characterization of one end-user
_Numbers assigned to the MS_
According to [3] any numbering plan should at least (but not exclusively)
support the following points:
  * **It should be possible for any subscriber of the ISDN or PSTN to call any MS in a PLMN.**
  * **The numbering/addressing plan should not limit the possibility for MSs to roam among PLMNs.**
  * **It should be possible to change the IMSI without changing the ISDN number allocated to an MS and vice versa.**
  * **It should be possible for any subscriber of the CSPDN/PSPDN to call any MS in a PLMN.**
  * **It should be possible for any fixed or mobile terminal to communicate with a mobile terminal using an IP v4 address or IP v6 address.**
MS international ISDN numbers (MSISDN): allocated from the ITU-T
Recommendation E.164 numbering plan; see also ITU-T Recommendation E.213. The
composition of the MSISDN number should be such that it can be used as a
global title address in the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) for
routeing messages to the home location register of the MS.
Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN): used to route calls directed to an MS.
On request from the Gateway MSC via the HLR it is temporarily allocated to an
MS by the VLR with which the MS is registered; it addresses the Visited MSC
collocated with the assigning VLR. More than one MSRN may be assigned
simultaneously to an MS.
MS international data numbers: should comply with the data numbering plan of
ITU-T Recommendation X.121 as applied in the home country of the mobile
subscriber.

Figure 5.3.1.2.2.4: Characterization of one end-user via numbers assigned to
an MS
Handover number: used for establishment of a circuit between MSCs to be used
for a call being handed over. The structure of the handover number is the same
as the structure of the MSRN.

allocated to each PLMN.
_Identification of local areas and base stations_

as follows:
  * **NCC: PLMN Colour Code**
  * **BCC: BS Colour Code**

    * **the Country Code (CC): identifies the country in which the PLMN is located;**
    * **the National Destination Code (NDC): identifies the PLMN in that country;**
    * **the Zone Code (ZC): identifies a regional subscription zone as a pattern of allowed and not allowed location areas uniquely within that PLMN.**
CC and NDC are ITU-T E.164 VLR or SGSN numbers. If a mobile subscriber has a
regional subscription [3], the HLR shall store a list of up to ten Regional
Subscription Zone Identities (RSZIs) per Network Destination Code (NDC) of the
PLMN involved.
Location Number: defines a specific location within a PLMN. The location
number is formatted according to ITU-T Recommendation E.164, as follows:
  * **The Country Code (CC) and**
  * **National Destination Code (NDC) fields of the location number are those which define the PLMN of which the location is part.**
_Identities for MSCs, GSNs, and location registers_
MSCs, GSNs and location registers are identified by international PSTN/ISDN
numbers and/or Signalling Point Codes (\"entity number\") i.e.:
  * **\"HLR number\",**
  * **\"VLR number\",**
  * **\"MSC number\",**
  * **\"SGSN number\" and**
  * **\"GGSN number\"**

  * **to the Voice Broadcast Service (VBS):** unique within a PLMN
Note:
  * **There is no uniqueness between the two sets of IDs.**
  * VGCS or VBS shall also be provided for roaming. If this applies, certain Group IDs shall be defined as supra-PLMN Group IDs which have to be co-ordinated between the network operators and which shall be known in the networks and in the SIM
Group Call Area ID: allows grouping of cells into specific group call areas in
support of both

  * **the Voice Broadcast Service (** number uniquely assigned to a group call area in one network**)**
Voice Group Call Reference: Specific instances of voice group calls; composed
of the Group ID and the Group Call Area ID; can be specific for each network
operator
Voice Broadcast Call Reference: Specific instances of voice broadcast calls;
composed of the Group ID and the Group Call Area ID; can be specific for each

  * **The APN Operator Identifier: this defines in which PLMN GPRS backbone the GGSN is located. This part of the APN is optional.**
The APN field in the HLR may contain a wild card APN if the HPLMN operator
allows the subscriber to access any network of a given PDP Type. If an SGSN
has received such a wild card APN, it may either choose the APN Network
Identifier received from the Mobile Station or a default APN Network
Identifier for addressing the GGSN when activating a PDP context.

_Numbering, addressing and identification within the IP multimedia core
network subsystem_
Home Network Domain Name: shall be in the form of an Internet domain name
If there is no ISIM application, the UE shall derive the home network domain
name from the IMSI as described in the following steps:
  * take the first 5 or 6 digits, depending on whether a 2 or 3 digit MNC is used and separate them into MCC and MNC; if the MNC is 2 digits then a zero shall be added at the beginning;
  * use the MCC and MNC derived in step 1 to create the \"mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org\" domain name;
  * add the label \"ims.\" to the beginning of the domain.
An example of a home network domain name is: IMSI in use: 234150999999999;
where:
  * MCC = 234;
  * MNC = 15;
  * MSIN = 0999999999,
> This gives the home network domain name: ims.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org
Private User Identity: shall take the form of an NAI, and shall have the form
username\@realm
If there is no ISIM application, the private user identity is not known. If
the private user identity is not known, the private user identity shall be
derived from the IMSI. With the example from above one gets:
234150999999999@ims.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org
Public User Identity: shall take the form of either
  * a SIP URI (see IETF RFC 3261) or
  * a tel URL (see IETF RFC 3966).
A SIP URI for a Public User Identity shall take the form \"sip:user\@domain\".
If there is no ISIM application to host the public user identity, a temporary
public user identity shall be derived, based on the IMSI. With the example of
above one gets \"sip:234150999999999\@ims.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org\".
Public Service Identity (PSI): identifies a service, or a specific resource
created for a service on an application server. The domain part is pre-defined
by the IMS operators and the IMS system provides the flexibility to
dynamically create the user part of the PSIs; shall take the form of either a
  * SIP URI or a
  * Tel URI
The PSIs are stored in the HSS either as a distinct PSI or as a wildcarded
PSI. A distinct PSI contains the PSI that is used in routing, whilst a
wildcarded PSI represents a collection of PSIs (the following PSI could be
stored in the HSS - \"sip:chatlist!.*!\@example.com\").
Anonymous User Identity: shall take the form of a SIP URI
(\"sip:anonymous\@anonymous.invalid\")
Unavailable User Identity: shall take the form of a SIP URI
(\"sip:unavailable\@unknown.invalid\")
Emergency Public User Identity: shall be derived from a public user identity
as follows:
  * UE selects any public user identity that is a SIP URI from ISIM. If the UE does not have ISIM, UE derives a temporary public user identity from IMSI as described above.
  * UE adds \"sos.\" to the beginning of the domain part of the selected public user identity.
For example if the SIP URI for the selected public user identity is
\"sip:user\@domain\", the corresponding emergency public user identity is
\"sip:user\@sos.domain\".
_Numbering, addressing and identification for 3GPP System to WLAN
Interworking_
Home Network Realm: shall be in the form of an Internet domain name, e.g.
operator.com.
When attempting to authenticate within WLAN access, the WLAN UE shall derive
the home network domain name from the IMSI as described in the following
steps:
  * take the first 5 or 6 digits, depending on whether a 2 or 3 digit MNC is used and separate them into MCC and MNC; if the MNC is 2 digits then a zero shall be added at the beginning;
  * use the MCC and MNC derived in step 1 to create the \"mnc\.mcc\. 3gppnetwork.org\" domain name;
  * add the label \"wlan.\" to the beginning of the domain name.
With the example from above one gets wlan.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org.
Root NAI: shall take the form of a NAI, and shall have the form
username\@realm as specified above.
  * The username part format of the Root NAI shall comply with
    * IETF RFC 4187 when EAP AKA authentication is used and with
    * IETF RFC 4186 , when EAP SIM authentication is used.
  * When the username part includes the IMSI, the Root NAI shall be built according to the following steps:
    * Generate an identity conforming to NAI format from IMSI as defined in EAP SIM [51] and EAP AKA as appropriate
    * Convert the leading digits of the IMSI, i.e. MNC and MCC, into a domain name.
> The result will be a root NAI of the form:
>
> \"0\\@wlan.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org\", for EAP AKA
> authentication and \"1\\@wlan.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org\",
> for EAP SIM authentication
>
> Using the example above, for EAP AKA authentication: If the IMSI is
> 234150999999999 (MCC = 234, MNC = 15), the root NAI then takes the form
> 0234150999999999\@wlan.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org.
Decorated NAI: takes the form of a NAI and shall have the form
\'homerealm!username\@otherrealm\' .
  * realm part: consists of
    * \'otherrealm\' is the realm built using the PLMN ID (visitedMCC + visited MNC) of the PLMN selected as a result of WLAN PLMN selection.
    * \'Homerealm\' is the realm as specified using the HPLMN ID (\'homeMCC\' + \'homeMNC)\'.
  * The username part format of the Root NAI shall comply with
    * IETF RFC 4187 when EAP AKA authentication is used and with
    * IETF RFC 4186 when EAP SIM authentication is used.
> When the username part of Decorated NAI includes the IMSI, the result will
> be a decorated NAI of the form:
>
> \"wlan.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
> !0\\@wlan.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org\", for EAP
> AKA authentication and \" wlan.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
> !1\\@wlan.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org \", for
> EAP SIM authentication
Using the example from above for EAP AKA authentication: If the IMSI is
234150999999999 (MCC = 234, MNC = 15) and the PLMN ID of the Selected PLMN is
MCC = 610, MNC = 71 then the Decorated NAI takes the form
wlan.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org!0234150999999999\@wlan.mnc071.mcc610.3gppnetwork.org.
Alternative NAI: shall take the form of a NAI, i.e. \'any_username\@REALM\' as
specified of IETF RFC 4282. The Alternative NAI

more MBMS SAs, and therefore is addressable by one or more MBMS SAIs.
_Numbering, addressing and identification within the GAA subsystem_
Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) address: The UE shall discover the BSF
address from the identity information related to the UICC application that is
used during the bootstrapping procedure i.e. IMSI for USIM, or IMPI for ISIM,
in the following way:
  * In the case where the USIM is used in bootstrapping, the BSF address shall be derived as follows:
    * take the first 5 or 6 digits, depending on whether a 2 or 3 digit MNC is used and separate them into MCC and MNC; if the MNC is 2 digits then a zero shall be added at the beginning;
    * use the MCC and MNC derived in step 1 to create the \"mnc\.mcc\.pub.3gppnetwork.org\" domain name;
    * add the label \"bsf.\" to the beginning of the domain.
> Example 1: If IMSI in use is \"234150999999999\", where MCC=234, MNC=15, and
> MSIN=0999999999, the BSF address would be

  * In the case where ISIM is used in bootstrapping, the BSF address shall be derived as follows:
    * extract the domain name from the IMPI;
    * add the label \"bsf.\" to the beginning of the domain.
> Example 2: If the IMPI in use is \"user\@operator.com\", the BSF address
> would be \"bsf.operator.com \".

  * use the MCC and MNC derived in step 1 to create the \"mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org\" network realm;
  * add the label \"gan.\" to the beginning of the network realm.
> An example of a home network realm is: IMSI in use: 234150999999999 where:
> MCC = 234; MNC = 15; MSIN = 0999999999, which gives the home network realm:

##### 5.3.1.2.3 Identity Management of the End-User
In this subsection some consequences, both legal and business related, of
looking at an end-user are covered. Identity Management is shown to cover
these issues as a concept and the standardized version of OMA is introduced.
###### 5.3.1.2.3.1 Motivation for analysing Identity Management
The identity of a person (in the context of this TR the end-user) comprises
many partial identities [46] which represent the person in specific contexts
or roles. For the 3GPP, OMA ITU-T etc many of these identities have been shown
in section 5.1 Managing the identity of this end-user means managing the
various partial identities.
According to [46] today\'s most broadly accepted definition of legal person is
a human being to which the legal systems refers rights, privileges and
obligations (Kelsen 1966).
Under current legislation, the identity of physical persons in legislation has
no systematic regulation. It is a stratification of definitions, which do not
always match with each other and has two main functions:
  * To grant identification for legal purposes and
  * To protect individual rights of freedom (name, identity, self determination, freedom of speech, privacy, etc.) related to a physical person.
The aspects of the human personality granted by the (constitutional)
legislation of democratic legal systems, regulated by private law and also
protected against unilateral unauthorised aggression by third parties are:
  * The name and the identity;
  * Freedom from physical constriction (habeas corpus);
  * Inviolability of the domicile and right of privacy;
  * Freedom of speech and self expression, in particular two sub-categories of it:
    * The right to choose one\'s image;
    * The right to protect one\'s honour;
  * Freedom of movement and to settle (granted only to fully aged people).
The personal identity is regulated at constitutional level, by the treaty of
the European Union, by national private legislation, and protected by rules of
the criminal law, against unduly unauthorised interference by third parties.
Moreover administrative law regulates personal identity.
_The Concept of Identity in the European Directive_
The European Directive 95/46/CE about data protection is aimed at giving to
the data subject (owner of data) the most control possible on its own identity
and personal data, posing a series of requirements on recipients, controllers,
processors and even third parties. Art. 2, letter a), giving a definition of
\"personal data\", says: \"identifiable person is one who can be identified,
directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number
or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental,
economic, cultural or social identity\".
The main principles behind the Data Protection Directive are:
  * Personal data must always be processed fairly and lawfully
  * Personal data must be collected for explicit and legitimate purposes and used accordingly
  * Personal data must be relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are processed
  * Data that identify individuals must not be kept longer than necessary.
  * Data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
  * Data controllers are required to provide reasonable measures for data subjects to rectify, erase or block incorrect data about them
  * Appropriate technical and organisational measures should be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data
  * Personal data must not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country ensures an \"adequate level of protection\" for data subjects.
Technologically, the terms \"ID\" or \"identifier\" play a big role rather
than \"identity\" and denote \"technological identities\" of any possible
object (or subject). An identifier could be a name, a serial number, or some
other pointer or address to the entity being identified. Some identifiers
allow unique mapping to a specific individual. Even if identifiers are not
directly assigned to a user, but to, e.g., pieces of his/her hardware or
programmes, the specific user may often be derived. Examples of identifiers
are
  * IDs for data sets, e.g., in relational databases where (unique) identifiers can be used to address data in a table or to join data of different tables (here e.g. MSISDN, IMSI);
  * The MAC (Media Access Control) address which is a unique network card address and identifies the computer in a local area network, e.g., as an Ethernet address;
  * The IP address which identifies the computer in the Internet;
  * Globally unique identifiers (GUIDs), e.g.,IMSI;
Thus, those identifiers can be found in hardware, in software or in services.
For acting within an ICT (Information and Communications Technologies) system,
the user has to be assigned an identifier. In many cases authentication, i.e.,
a verification of a claimed identity, of the user is necessary before any
other action. In general there are three different methods for authentication:
  * \"Something you know\" (e.g., a secret such as a password),
  * \"Something you have\" (e.g., a token or a chipcard) and
  * \"Something you are\" (biometrics).
The processes of authentication and identification are distinct.
Identification, seen from the technological perspective, associates an
identifier with an individual without the requirement of a claim on the part
of the subject. The objective of identification is to determine which
identifier refers to an individual. In contrast, authentication refers to the
process of verifying the linkage between a (claimed) identifier and the
individual.
From a legal point of view [46] the management of identities is not granted by
legislation as such out of the following reasons:
  * The category is relevant principally in technological environment, in particular in open networks (Internet).
  * Identity is not regulated organically by legislation, as it would be required in order to have a legal management of identities.
  * Identity from a legal perspective has a dual function. Identification of the subjects and reference point for rights and obligations.
Nonetheless legislation provides some (in most cases) constitutionally
protected rights to individuals, that allow them to change some aspects of
their identity, even if such changes are in conflict with the first function
of the identity, which is to ensure uniqueness and identifiability of
subjects. One of the topics is the right to pseudonymity, which can be defined
as the right not to disclose that we don\'t want to disclose our identity.
This is at least the case with pseudonyms which look like real names and
don\'t reveal that they are pseudonyms.
So in order to identify a person in open networks, technically (and legally)
speaking a name or an address does not need to be known any more. With the
permission of the interested person one can connect the story of a relation to
a reliable unique identifier (the pseudonym or the number of the signature
certificate).
Technically and legally speaking, following the idea of the Directive on
Electronic Signatures, which expressly declares the possibility of using
pseudonyms, one can lawfully have different identities for on-line relations
one establishes. Form this fact the authors of [46] deduce the need for an
Identity Management System (IMS).
Another legal issue is the right to privacy. According to [46] it comprises
the right not to disclose information and the obligation for data processing
parties to provide technological and organisational measures to protect
disclosed personal data. So the data gathering as such is not prohibited, but
in order to collect personal data lawfully, there is the obligation to inform
the interested person (and the data protection authority). Data minimisation
is the key approach of legal systems recognising an individual right to data
protection.
Note: The current problem is that data minimisation is an approach difficult
to enforce: it is more difficult to select relevant data than to store
everything that could be of interest. Storage capability is no more a limiting
factor: huge databases and storage devices have become dramatically cheaper in
the last 10 years.
The difficulty to enforce a proper gathering and handling of personal data is
the reason why there is an increasing interest in Identity Management Systems.
The problem of properly implementing on-line identity has been technically
solved: There is the possibility to use the electronic signature for mutual
identification and authentication. The problems related to the identification
through a terminal or a random telecommunication link, can be solved through
cryptographic tools, instead with IP addresses or other inappropriate
substitutes.
Up to now pseudonymity or anonymity were the only viable options for on-line
interaction. A reliable identification needed always at least some kind of
direct or indirect personal contact. This is not anymore true: Many kinds of
electronic signatures are available so that legally speaking there are the
following options practicable:
  * To be fully recognisable through qualified certificates, according to the Annex I of the Directive on Electronic Signatures 93/1999 EU;
  * To be recognisable through a pseudonym displayed on the qualified certificate, according to the Annex I of the Directive on Electronic Signatures 93/1999 EU;
  * To self declare one\'s identity;
  * Not to declare one\'s identity.
[46] also deals with the technical aspects pertaining to the legal aspects
just introduced for identities and Identity Management Systems.
As technical identities simply are numbers or strings, which can represent any
object, they may identify directly or indirectly an individual, an
organisation, or a machine. It is relevant from the privacy perspective that
even if those identifiers do not directly represent an individual, but only a
specific device, frequently there is a relation to a person so that many of
these identities have to be regarded as at least potentially personal data.
But as the existence and the disclosure of those IDs often goes unnoticed by
the users, managing them is quite difficult: In many cases technology does not
provide the functionality to influence assignment, storage and disclosure of
those IDs. A possibility to regain control over these IDs is offered by some
anonymising services which help the users in substituting or deleting those
identifiers. In general it is not possible to successfully manage one\'s
partial identities without knowing when and where they may be involuntarily
disclosed. This is not only the case with data trails in digital networks, but
also capturing biometrics, e.g., by video surveillance, is often possible
without knowledge and consent of the individual.103 Whereas the user can blur
identifying data by anonymising services, there is no equivalent solution for
preventing others to capture publicly noticeable biometrics such as the face,
the shape of the body or the way of walking. Identity Management Systems as
described in this study are acting as gateways and guardians for users in
digital networks, but cannot prevent undesired data collection outside the
network.
###### 5.3.1.2.3.2 Identity Management in OMA
OMA developed an Identity management enabler in whose requirement document
[86] it evaluates the benefits of a single Identity Management enabler for all
OMA enablers to be:
  * Management and use of Identity or personal information is easier for all stakeholders: End Users, mobile operators, enterprises and Service Providers;
  * End Users do not have the burden of having to understand different service-specific Identity solutions;
  * The same Identities and personal information can be utilised by multiple services;
  * Privacy protection can be enabled more easily using a common Identity Management enabler;
  * The OMA will not be seen to publish specifications with disparate, conflicting Identity Management solutions;
  * Identity needs are the same (or very similar) for all enablers and so, by creating a single Identity Management enabler, duplication of work is kept to a minimum;
  * New enablers with Identity requirements will be able to benefit from the existing Identity Management enabler;
  * Greater interoperability between enablers;
  * Improved time to market for those enablers that use the Identity Management enabler.
In [86] OMA also identified additional benefits if existing, standardised
Authentication / Authorisation methods could be re-used in an Identity
Management enabler. One such example is mobile operator subscription-based
Identity:
  * Mobile operators already have an excellent trust relationship with millions of End Users due to their high level of security;
  * Mobile operators can offer services of their own, or third party services, with improved Authentication and privacy protection by using IDP and Identity Broker models;
  * Mobile operators can offer content Service Providers simple, event-based billing services suitable for low-value transactions.
OMA includes in its scope the following types of Identities:
  * End User Identity: relating to the provisioning of and access to End User Identity information and related Attributes in
    * the mobile operator,
    * Service Provider,
    * enterprise infrastructures and in
    * the Device.
> This includes the management (e.g. conflict resolution) of several
> simultaneous Identities (for one End User) that enable multiple End User
> profiles, such as employee and a private customer profiles. Delegation and
> sharing of authority is also included in scope in order to enable the role
> of an intermediary Agent (e.g. for some enterprise situations).
  * Provider Identity: for Authentication and to support delegation of authority.
  * Device Identity: to enable topics such as digital rights management, for example.
  * Application / Service Identity: to identify enterprise applications, for example, or enable the use of Identity Containers.
The following figure describes the Identity Management ecosystem as OMA sees
it [86].
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="3.1590277777777778in"}
Figure 5.3.1.2.2.2.1: OMA's vision of an Identity Management eco system [86]
The following paragraphs describe a set of simplified Identity Management
roles that the different actors in the ecosystem can implement and the
interactions that would happen between them.
OMA defines the following mechanisms by which the actors in the IdM ecosystem
can interact to exchange Identity information:
  * The ability to discover Identity information;
  * How Identity information can be transferred from one Entity to another;
  * The ability to control the
    * availability,
    * visibility, and
    * use of Identity information.
The following roles - defined by OMA - can be used and implemented by the
different actors of the Identity Management ecosystem:
  * Principal Agent: A Principal is an Entity that has an Identity, and owns all Identity information about itself. Examples:
    * human beings (End Users),
    * a Group of End Users,
    * a corporation,
    * service enablers / applications,
    * system Entities and
    * other legal Entities.
> A Principal Agent is an IdM role that represents 'real world domain' of a
> mobile operator or enterprise (can be thought of as a delegated source of
> Identity information i.e. delegated by the 'real world domain' Principal).
  * Identity-based Service Consumer: IdM role that, in order to perform its functions, requires some Identity information about a Principal.
> Example: Provider that implements a weather forecast service. The Provider
> might wish to request location information (from an Identity-based Service
> Provider) about a certain End User in order to provide a local weather
> report to that End User.
  * Identity-based Service Provider: IdM role that provides Identity information or Identity services for / about a Principal. The role of an Identity-based Service Provider includes acting upon some resource in order to
    * either retrieve information about an Identity,
    * update information about an Identity, or
    * perform some action for the benefit of some Identity.
> Attribute Provider: a special type of Identity-based Service Provider, whose
> function is to provide Identity Attributes about a specified Principal.
> Therefore an Attribute Provider would create, read, update, or delete
> Attributes of a Principal.
  * Identity Provider (IDP): IdM role that offers key, core Identity functions that are required in order for other Identity services to be possible.
  * Discovery Service Provider: IdM role that knows what Attributes are available for a particular Principal and how to gain access to those Attributes. Note that a Discovery Service Provider would not actually know the value of a particular Attribute, but just the Address of an appropriate Identity-based Service Provider.
In addition OMA describes the relationship between the Identity Management
enabler and the OMA Policy enforcement infrastructure.
According to [86] the roles of the IdM ecosystem may need to make
Authorisation decisions and evaluate other Policies (i.e. they may have to
perform functions that belong to a Policy evaluation and enforcement enabler).
If necessary, policy enforcement will be handled via delegation of certain
PEEM functions to those other enablers that specialise in the particular
functions.
Finally OMA sees the following use cases:
  * Single Sign On (SSO) and Authentication Contexts:
    * Single Sign On improves the End User experience by reducing the number of username / password combinations that the End User must remember, and by reducing the number of keystrokes required on the Device.
    * Single Sign On can also improve security because it is more likely that an Identity Provider would use a more secure, 2 or 3-Factor Authentication solution than a Service Provider would (e.g. a SIM Smart Card in combination with an End User PIN)
  * Federation, Single Log Out, and De-Federation: This use case describes some of the background processes that enable SSO. Specifically, this use case discusses:
    * Federation of an End User's Account at an IDP with her Account at an SP;
    * De-Federation of an existing Federation;
    * Single Log Out (SLO) of an End User.
  * Delegation of Authority to Federate Identities, Bulk Federations and De-Federations: There are many cases where an End User may wish to delegate authority to federate her Identity Provider Account with her (new or existing) Accounts at other Service Providers to the Identity Provider itself, so that the IDP may federate her Accounts on her behalf. Using this delegated authority, the IDP can federate the End User's IDP Account with (new or existing) End User Accounts at SPs without the End User having to be logged in (i.e. authenticated) at the time.
  * Seamless Attribute Transfer and Usage Directives:
    * Seamless Attribute Transfer: Typically, an End User has to enter her personal profile information (her Identity _Attributes_) many times when using on-line services. By offering seamless Attribute Transfer Identity Management can relieve the End User of this tiresome task.
    * Including _Usage Directives_ when requesting End User Attributes from _Attribute Providers_ : By Usage Directives OMA means a set of directives regarding how a particular Attribute would be used by the Service Provider once the Attribute has been released to it. By Attribute Provider OMA means a Service Provider whose service is to store and manage End Users' Attributes on their behalf.
  * Anonymous Attribute Transfer: There are many scenarios where a Service Provider may wish to access certain Attributes associated with an End User without actually knowing the Identity of the End User.
  * Transactions and Event Tokens: End User purchases goods and services using mobile Device enabled payment processes, where the merchant selling the goods and / or services could be a retail establishment or an online vendor.
  * Authentication Domains, Identity Brokers and Circles of Trust: In a deployment scenario where several Identity Providers and Service Providers exist, it is highly likely that each Identity Provider will have business agreements with several Service Providers. Furthermore, a Service Provider may have to enter into a business agreement with many Identity Providers in order to cover a large customer base, which is not desirable from a Service Provider's point of view. In order to address these points the notion of Authentication Domains, Identity Brokers and Circles of Trust are introduced.
    * An Authentication Domain consists of one Identity Provider and all the Service Providers (and End Users) that have the necessary technical and business arrangements in place with the Identity Provider in order to be able to offer (or use) SSO services.
    * IDP1 and IDP2 might create a business agreement that allows them to act as _Identity Brokers_ for each other. There still exist two Authentication Domains, but IDP1 and IDP2 can act as Identity Brokers in order to introduce Service Providers in one Authentication Domain to an Identity Provider (and hence End Users) in another Authentication Domain.
    * Circle of Trust means that there is a potential trusted link between every End User and every Service Provider in the Circle of Trust. A Circle of Trust could, itself, be a part of a bigger Circle of Trust, to the extent that if every IDP acts as an Identity Broker for at least one or two other IDPs then it would be easily possible to create an almost global Circle of Trust.
  * Service Provider Alliances: There are many cases where several Service Providers decide to work together to form an Alliance so that, for certain functions, they appear as a single Entity to the End User. In other words, the different Entities or companies in the Alliance are no longer relevant to the End User, but the End User is merely interested in the services that the Alliance has to offer as a collective unit.
###### 5.3.1.2.3.3 Identity Management using a common datamodel and the CPSF
The existence of one end-user model stored in a logically centralized common
profile storage framework (for details see section 6) has soms business
related aspects:
  * The centralization of user administration tasks allows to
    * Reduce admin costs and
    * Improve accuracy and security of data store
  * New applications can leverage the existing infrastructure which leads to a reduction of deployment time for new applications
  * Improvement of end-user experience:
    * Quick access to applications for new users
    * Allows to modify attributes or preferences at one location only
    * Allows customized application experience (applications understand the user preferences and roles)
  * Improvement of application security:
    * Password and security credentials managed centrally
    * Usability greatly improved
In addition some principles of fair information practices can be observed and
proved more easily, when dealing with the identity of an end-user stured ina
logically centralized CPSF within a common data model.
  * Openess:
    * Means for establishing the existence and nature of personal data
    * Main purpose of the use of the data
  * Collection Limitation:
    * Limits to collection of personal data
    * Acquisition by lawful and fair means (evtl. with knowledge and/or consent of data subject)
  * Purpose specification:
    * Purpose, for which the data are collected, must be known latest at the moment of the beginn of the data collection
    * Use of the data shall be limited to the fullfillment of those purposes
  * Limitation of data usage:
    * Non-disclosure of personal data
    * Use limited to purpose negotiated (subject to mutually agreed change requests)
#### 5.3.1.4 The Relation between an End-User and a Subscriber
In clause 5.3.1.2 the relation of the end-user to his various key attributes
has been discussed. This clause highlights the relationship between a contract
holder and an end-user in more detail.
Figure 5.3.1.4.1 shows the general situation: An end-user can have n cards
with the same or different services assigned. The end-user may also be a
contract holder (subscriber), but does not need to be so. A contract holder
can be assigned to one or more cards (for which he is billed) and to one or
more end-users.
The following figure gives a simple example:
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="4.104861111111111in"}
Figure 5.3.1.4.1: Specific example of the relationship between an end-user and
a contract holder
Contract holder 1 is a company, which has n employees, with one mobile phone
each (paid for by the company). Employee n (UID_n) is also a contract holder
(contract holder m), because in addition to the company phone he has a pre-
paid mobile for his private use. Thus UID_n is assigned two different keys
(IMSI_1, IMSI_2).
### 5.3.2 Semantic Identity of Data Entities
One idea of a common data model is to avoid redundant definition and storage
of data model entities. So all data, which are used by more than one network
function in the same way (\"semantic identity\") shall only be defined once.
This requirement has to be analysed under the following conditions:
  * Different applications might need differing forms of representation of the semantically identical data entities in question.
> The representation of a numerical value might be a number (Roman or Arabic,
> which already creates a problem) or a string ("fifteen"). In addition, if
> this value is needed in string form, it might be needed in English by one
> application and in French by another application.
>
> In case of object oriented databases the objects might contain the same
> attributes, but might be called differently (e.g. different standardization
> bodies defining the same entities).
  * Different applications might need the semantically identical data differently organized out of functional reasons
> A set of attributes might be put into n object classes for one application,
> the reason being that for a fast read there should not be too many data to
> be analyzed. For another application it might be essential to read as many
> data as possible with one read, so the set of attributes is put into one
> object class only.
  * Different applications might need the semantically identical data differently organized out of backwards compatibility reasons
> Out of historical reasons, applications using the same data entities in a
> directory type of organization (e.g. X.500) might still have different
> organizations of their tree.
  * In general, an application should not need to know of the existence of another application
> This bullet has implications both for the physical architecture of the data
> storage (certain properties of distributed systems have to be met) and on
> the way, in which the data model itself has to be designed. Here only the
> last point is of interest and can be summarized by the requirement that the
> addition of a new network function or management application onto the
> central profile store should not affect the data access layer of the network
> functions or management applications already working with the central
> profile store.
>
> At this point the notion "semantically identical" comes to its full
> importance: If two CPS applications have write access to the same data
> entity, it must be clear that
  * the same understanding about the consequences of a data manipulation must exist within the two applications, that
  * the necessity to change the data entity must be experienced by both applications in the same situations and that
  * there needs to be a mechanism via which all interested applications of the CPS can be informed of the change of the data entity (for a suggestion see the subsection about triggers).
```{=html}
``` \- Only the applications, which need access to a data entity, should be
granted this access.
> Once the common data model would -- theoretically -- be accessible to all
> database users, one has to take care that only authenticated and authorized
> users manipulate certain data entities.
### 5.3.3 Adapting Entities
In order to be able to comply with the bullets above, adapting entities shall
be defined, which
  * Provide a certain view of the complete or data model or a part of it,
  * Are able to provide different value representations for the same value,
  * Are able to provide the proper access rights,
  * Hide the fact that they ARE adapting entities and
  * Are able to inform subscribed applications of a value change of a data entity.
### 5.3.4 Content of Post Update Triggers
In any of the cases described in 4.3.2, in which two or more network functions
use the same data entity as described in 4.3.3, it must be possible for all of
these network functions to be informed about any change happening to the data
entity in question.
As soon as the creation, deletion or modification of a data model item common
to two or more network functions has been carried out by the end-user
database, a triggering mechanism should be able to inform any interested
network function about it.
Content: Name of the data entity, old value, new value
### 5.3.5 Adaptation Layer
In the relational world, views as defined in SQL cover part of the
requirements, in the object oriented world implementation of the functionality
required for adapting entities would most probably be proprietary.
The capabilities, which need to be implemented into the CPS so that adapting
entities can be defined, have been summarized under the notion Adaptation
Layer Functions (ALF).
The data model part containing the adapting entities is called Adaptation
Layer.
Note: The adaptation Layer is not a layer in the sense of X.200.
### 5.3.6 Different Levels of Data Consolidation
This clause discusses two completely different approaches to the design of a
complete data model of an end-user:
  * [Approach 1:]{.underline} The complete model is exposed to all network functions and only in the cases, where there are semantically identical data entities handled by different network functions, Adaptation Layer Functionality is used to guarantee the integrity of these entities for all involved network functions.
  * [Approach 2:]{.underline} The complete model is hidden from the network functions (perhaps, because it reflects the business processes of a provider) and Adaptation Layer Functionality has to be provided for a high percentage of the entities of the data model in order to satisfy the network functions.
  * [Approach 3:]{.underline} Mixed scenarios, which allow to expose real data to network functions or enterprise applications, if out of some reason this seems desirable.
#### 5.3.6.1 Adaptation Layer for partial Data Consolidation (Approach 1)
The complete structure of the end-user data model is, in principle, exposed to
any network function. A specific network function is
  * either able to ignore data, which are not relevant for its function,
  * or the data base requests are tailored so that only data relevant for this network function are manipulated.

Figure 5.3.2.1.1: Overview over a common object model in case of a partial
data consolidation
In case two network functions share a common data entity (Entity Y in Figure
5.3.2.1.1) then it may be necessary to define Adapting Entities Y1 and Y2
under the conditions described in section 4.3.3.
#### 5.3.6.2 Adaptation Layer for full data consolidation (Approach 2)
The structure of the common data model is completely hidden from the network
functions for reasons discussed in more detail in section 6.

Layer
#### 5.3.6.3 Mixed Scenarios (Approach 3)
Depending on the criteria for the definition of the word \"common\" in common
data model, the common part might, semantically seen, contain only a subset of
data needed by one of the network functions.

# 6 Basic Structure of the Common Profile Storage Framework (CPSF)
Clause 6.1 just gives the general properties such a storage framework should
have independent of any variant of implementation.
Clause 6.2 describes possible ways to realize a centralized data base.
Clause 6.3 describes ways in which a CPSF could be realized.
Clause 6.4 is devoted to the question, what kind of tooling would be needed to
make the CPSF work in reality.
## 6.1 Logical View
This clause deals with the functions the CPSF has to support. Figure 6.1.1
depicts a typical three-tier architecture consisting of a:
  * Database subsystem, which is concerned with data management and > resource management; and
  * Application subsystem containing network functions (e.g. HSS, HLR, > etc.) as well as enterprise applications (e.g. CRM, Marketing > applications, etc.); and
  * A client subsystem providing e.g. a GUI.
Figure 6.1.1: Logical view of the Common Profile Storage Framework as a 3-tier
architecture
### 6.1.1 Actual End-User Data Storage Framework
This clause deals with the part of the framework, which takes care of the real
data handling.
**_Resource Management:_**
  * _Data Storage Management:_ This function hides the storage > complexity from the application orchestrating the execution of > queries, including I/O generation and caching.
  * _Physical Device Management:_ This function has the task of ensuring > optimal query execution in database management systems using a > variety of metrics, cost estimators, and run-time statistics to > devise a query plan with the lowest cost.
**_Data Management:_**
  * _Data transformation and presentation:_ This function has two > properties:
\- Maintenance of data independence.
\- Removal of the distinction between logical and physical data.
  * _Concurrency Control:_ This function prevents clashes between user > operations:
\- Allows high database performance by admitting concurrent data accesses from
multiple network functions and enterprise applications at the same time.
\- Ensures that interleaved action coming from multiple network functions and
enterprise applications do not lead to inconsistencies in the database.
\- Ensures that each network function and enterprise application is unaware of
all other concurrent database users.
  * _Backup and Restore:_ This function block provides backup and > restore mechanisms and strategies.
  * _Integrity Services:_ This function enforces referential integrity > rules.
  * _Transaction Processing:_ This function enforces the ACID > (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties on a > set of database operations, which have been collected into one > transaction:
\- Atomicity: If a set of database operation has been collected into one
transaction this transaction will only be committed, if all operations have
been carried out successfully.
\- Consistency: At the Begin and at the Commit of a transaction (or after the
roll back) the data within the database have to be consistent.
\- Isolation:
  * network functions and enterprise applications seemingly run one at a > time; and
  * are protected by either locking mechanisms or database versioning.
\- Durability: A committed transaction has to survive failures:
  * Put the logs of committed transactions into a durable place (e.g. > duplicated disk);
  * Redo transactions from the log in case of:
\- System failure: lost in-memory updates.
\- Media failure (e.g. lost disk).
  * Undo non-committed transactions.
  * _Post Update Trigger Handling:_ This function allows:
\- The subscription to a post update trigger.
\- The sending of post update triggers to the subscribed users of the CPSF.
  * _Adapting Entities Management:_ This function decouples the network > functions and enterprise applications from the database in two > ways:
\- Logical decoupling: Provides all functions using the database with
protection from changes in the logical structure of the data (i.e. provides
tailored views for network functions and enterprise applications, which use
the database).
\- Physical decoupling: Provides all functions using the database with
protection from changes in the physical structure of the data.
  * _Security Management:_ This function provides:
\- Authentication and authorization.
\- Object access control.
\- Accountability via auditing.
  * Additional functions not shown in the figure:
\- Database access languages and application programming interfaces.
\- Database communications interfaces.
### 6.1.2 Adaptation Layer Functionality
This clause deals with the basic functionality, which a CPSF has to provide in
order to make data consolidation work. The sum of properties realizing this
functionality will be called Adaptation Layer for the rest of the present
document. The data model building blocks of the Adaptation Layer were already
introduced in clauses 5.3.2 and 5.3.4.
NOTE: The notion \"Layer\" is only logical. There are no well defined
interfaces on the north and south. Instead the \"Adaptation Layer\" consists
of a list of functions, which allow a complete decoupling of the Application
Subsystem whenever this is necessary.
#### 6.1.2.1 Adapting Entities
In accordance with the scenarios introduced in clause 5 adapting entities
shall be able to cover the following situations:
  * More than one application uses the same data entity, each needing a > different representation.
EXAMPLE: Language sensitive representation of values (e.g. red, rouge, rot),
different representation of values (1, one, I).
  * The real data model is used to support the business processes of a > provider and the application needs a specific \"view\" on its > data.\ > One advantage of a CPSF containing a common model is the fact that > it can contain all relevant business data for an end user as has > been shown in clause 5. Thus it is capable of supporting both > network functions and enterprise applications alike. There will > obviously be many ways to organize the data as long as the > principal structures described in clause 5.1 for the network > functions and in clause 5.3 for identification of an end user can > be retrieved. In which ever way a provider intends to structure > his data (best suited to his business), he will have to provide > specific adapting entities for some or all of his functions using > the CPSF.
  * Support of legacy applications: Here two situations need to be > distinguished:
\- Mandatory: The legacy application uses the same standardized data modelling
language and database access protocol, but its legacy data model does not fit
into the general data modelling strategy. Then respective \"views\" have to be
provided for the application.
\- Optional: The legacy application uses a different standardized data
modelling language and database access protocol, which cannot be adapted to
the current conditions. Then an according interface and an automatic
conversion into the current model entities allows the legacy application to
remain mainly unchanged.
#### 6.1.2.2 Access Control
Control of access to information:
  * prevention of unauthorized detection;
  * disclosure; or
  * modification of that information.
At minimum the Basic Access Control Model [44] from ITU-T has to be supported,
whose decisions entail actions on the following entities:
  * the entity of the data model being accessed - protected item;\ > a protected item is an element of the data model to which access > can be separately controlled\ > Basic Access Control also provides the means to define collections > of related items (e.g. attributes in an entry, all attribute > values of a given attribute) in order to specify a common > protection for them.
  * the user requesting the operation - requestor;
  * a particular right necessary to complete part of the operation - > permission;
  * one or more operational attributes that collectively contain the > security policy governing access to that item - ACIs (Access > Control Items).
#### 6.1.2.3 Post-Update Trigger Mechanism
In clause 5 the possibility of semantically identical attributes for different
network functions and enterprise application end-user models has been
discussed. In the case that one common end-user model is used, this attribute
will then be visible and accessible to all concerned functions and
applications.
#### 6.1.2.4 Preserving the Real-Time Capability of the CPSF
In clause 5 the proponents of the Application Layer were introduced.
Especially the applications listed under the network supporting services have
stringent real-time constraints. Thus any Adaptation Layer has to guarantee
their support.
## 6.2 Physical View
In this clause different possibilities of a physical realization of the CPSF
as a database are analyzed.
Clause 6.2.1 is a special case of clause 6.2.2. It just describes what a CPSF
should be able to do in case it could be realized via one NE only. The clause
is only very brief, as there is an abundant amount of literature describing
the basics of relational and object oriented databases.
Clause 6.2.2 treats the case, in which the database is distributed. Obviously,
some of the requirements discussed in clauses 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 are not easy to
realize in a distributed database, so some of its key features are reviewed.
### 6.2.1 Centralized Data Base
In a centralized database data are stored at one physical location (database
server) only, which might e.g. be a mainframe.
The network element should
  * Provide the properties described in clauses 6.1.1 and 6.1.2;
  * Be highly available; and
  * Allow geographical redundancy.
The last bullet actually needs some discussion. From a theoretical point of
view the database would then already be distributed and is treated as the case
of complete replicas (see clause 6.2.2).
### 6.2.2 Distributed Data Base
Again the network element should
  * Provide the properties described in clauses 6.1.1 and 6.1.2;
  * Be highly available; and
  * Allow geographical redundancy.
As a common denominator this TR will regard a distributed database as one
where data are stored at several physically different locations.
There are two different types of distributed databases:
  * Homogeneous databases: Every site runs the same type of DBMS.
  * Heterogeneous databases: Different sites run different DBMS (even > both RDBMS and ODBMS at the same time).
Distributed databases can have the following architectures:
  * Client-Servers Architecture:
\- The client sends a query to each database server in the system.
\- The client caches and accumulates all answers.
  * Collaborating Server Architecture:
\- The client sends the query to the nearest server.
\- The server either executes the query locally or sends it on to other
servers as required.
\- The server sends the response to the client.
Distributed data can be stored as follows:
  * In fragments at each site:
\- The data has to be split up.
\- Each site stores one or more fragments. This can have some advantages:
  * One can put the data near the function using it.
  * The network traffic can be reduced.
  * Response times can be optimized.
  * Availability of the data can be optimized .
  * In complete replicas at each site:
\- Each site stores a replica of the complete data. This can yield the
following advantages:
  * Improvement of data availability.
  * Allows disconnected operation.
  * Allows load distribution.
  * Read operations are much cheaper.
\- Replication can be done:
  * Synchronously: All data, which have been changed, must be propagated > before the transaction commits. Thus during the time, the changes > are made and propagated, the transaction gas to obtain a lock on > all modified copies.
  * Asynchronously: Updates are sent periodically, which has two > consequences:
\- Updates can go out of sync.
\- Functions using the database need to be aware of the fact that updates can
go out of sync.
  * Types of replication:
\- Primary site replication:
  * One copy is designated as a master.
  * All other copies are published to other, \"secondary\", sites.
\- Peer-To-Peer replication:
  * More than one copy can be master.
  * Conflicting changes must be resolved.
  * A mixture of fragments and replicas:
\- Each site stores a replica and/or one or more fragments of the complete
data.
## 6.3 Analysis of alternative solutions
In this clause different possibilities of realization of the CPSF within the
network are analyzed. The difference in the approaches concerns the questions:
  * whether one employs a separate, eventually distributed database for > all end-user data, which is logically seen as one network element > by all network functions and enterprise applications; or
  * whether the CPSF is logically seen as one network element.
### 6.3.1 Logically Centralized Approach
This clause deals with possible architectures of the CPSF, which can,
logically, be summarized as shown in figure 6.3.1.1.
Figure 6.3.1.1: Logical view of the Centralized Approach to the Common Profile
Storage Framework
Figure 6.3.1.1 shows that all applications (i.e. network functions and
enterprise applications) of the CPSF access one logical network element, which
provides them their specific data structure.
In case the scenario of clause 6.2.1 applies, figure 6.3.1.1 can be an example
of a physical realization. In case the physical realization of a CPSF is in
the form of a distributed system (one of the variants described in clause
6.2.2) figure 6.3.1.2 represents a valid example.
Figure 6.3.1.2: Physical view of the Centralized Approach to\ the Common
Profile Storage Framework Using a Distributed Database
Figure 6.3.1.2 gives an example of a possible CPSF deployment using a
distributed database.
Remarks:
  * Sites A, B and C are geographically redundant.
  * The DBS-Proxies are one possibility to provide uniform access for > the network/enterprise functions. In the example in figure 6.3.1.2 > there are nine such proxies, three per site for load balancing and > three geographically redundant copies for high availability.
  * The database servers contain the actual end-user data:
\- In the example there are 18 servers, six at each site. These six each
contain a fragment of the complete set of data and each site has a complete
replica for reasons of high availability.
\- The example also shows the possibility of connecting three specific DBSs
(1_A, 1_B, 1_C), which contain identical replicas of a data fragment (either
by peer to peer or by primary site replication).
  * The full mesh shown between the network / enterprise functions and > the DBS-Proxies, as well as between the DBS-Proxies and the > database servers is only shown in a logical sense. These > connections will most probably be switched.
### 6.3.2 Logically Distributed Approach
In clause 6.3.1 the fact that the database is distributed is hidden from all
network functions and management applications. This clause deals with a
distributed system, in which knowledge about its components may be necessary.
An example of a logically distributed approach is 3GPP\'s Generic User Profile
(GUP), which is described in more detail in clause 5.1.4.
A data consumer (network function or enterprise application) can request a
copy of a GUP component, which is the designated master instance of the
component and which - according to 3GPP - is held by the data supplier.
This copy may be of one of two types:
  * **Working copy** : the GUP component instance corresponds to a copy > (or snapshot) of the master instance at a given point in time. The > working copy is held within the data consumer\'s local store. > Future changes to the master instance (e.g. update, deletion, > etc.) are NOT propagated to the working copy. The working copy > remains unaffected by changes of the master instance of the GUP > component.
  * **Synchronized copy** : the GUP component instance is kept > synchronized with the master instance and is held within the data > consumer\'s local store.
If a GUP component is no longer applicable for a given user, the master
instance for this GUP component is deleted and all data stores holding
synchronized copies are notified about this deletion.
If the access rights of the component are changed, a proper notification is
sent to the owner of the synchronized copy.
## 6.4 Tooling
The intention of clause 6.4 is to point out the necessity that a fairly
comprehensive tooling landscape is necessary to allow a network/service
provider to:
  * be capable of defining a common data model and its adaptation layer > (i.e. adapt the data to the specific needs of this operator);
  * remain vendor independent in choosing both the CPSF and the network > functions / management applications;
  * be able to manipulate his data structures as well as the content in > a running system (the addition or modification of network > functions / management applications should not affect other > functions already running as users of the CPSF).
Areas in which the CPSF needs tooling are:
  * data migration support;
  * meta data manipulation and repository;
  * a tool management system; and
  * a report/documentation system.
# 7 Gap-Analysis
This section lists gaps between the current 3GPP concepts and concepts
introduced in this TR.
## 7.1 Concept of the End-User
According to [1] the following distinction between a subscriber and a user is
made:
Subscriber: A Subscriber is an entity (associated with one or more users) that
is engaged in a Subscription with a service provider. The subscriber is
allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe services, to register a user or a list of
users authorised to enjoy these services, and also to set the limits relative
to the use that associated users make of these services.
User: An entity, not part of the 3GPP System , which uses 3GPP System
services. Example: a person using a 3GPP System mobile station as a portable
telephone
While in the past these concepts/definitions have been sufficient to describe
the relevant roles in 3GPP the new concept of an "End-User", as described in
section 5.3.1, needs to be introduced in 3GPP.
To introduce the concept of an end-user in 3GPP the following gaps would need
to be closed:
  * The definition of an "End-User" in [1] and its relation to the terms "user" and "subscriber". An "end-user" exists independently of a particular service at first, but may be granted access to different services by a subscriber.
  * An (optional) requirement to be able to uniquely identify an End-User needs to be specified.
  * The definition of a UID identifying an End-User is missing in [2].
  * A decription of the UID and its relations to other identities (IMSI, IMPI, IMPU, ...) as well as relevant numbers (e.g. MSISDN) is missing in [3].
## 7.2 Concept of a Model Entity for a Contract Holder/Subscriber
In order to introduce a contractHolder as described in section 5.3.1, the
following gaps would have to be closed:
  * The definition of a subscriber as given in [1], or -- equivalently of a contractHolder as described in 5.3.1 of this TR -- is missing in [2].
  * The relations to subscription information (IMSI, subscriptionId for HSS, ...) are missing
## 7.3 Concept of a Contract
In order to understand the type of contract a contract holder is representing,
relevant contract information has to be present:
  * Pointers to subscription information are missing in [2]
  * Contract Information (Contract identification, Contract Version, ...) are missing in [2]
  * Pointers to the services to be delivered according to the contract are missing in [2]
  * Pointers to policies, where they exist are missing in [2]
## 7.4 Introduction of a network function "Common Profile Store (CPS)"
In order to introduce a Common Profile Storage Framework according to section
6 of the TR the following gaps have to be closed:
  * The definition of such a logical network element in TS 23.002 [13] and/or TS 23.228 [22] is missing
  * The definition of additional interfaces between the new NE and the network elements that depend on end-user-related data is missing
  * The description of impacts on the existing 3GPP NEs and network architecture is missing
# 8 Conclusions
This section lists proposed standardization actions based on the gaps between
the current 3GPP concepts and concepts introduced in this TR in section 7.
## 8.1 Introduce the Concept of an End-User
The scope of the end-user concept should be
  * that it is supported by all vendors providing a common end-user model to providers and
  * It exists independent of a particular service, but may assume the "user" role in services under a particular subscription. An end-user may also act as a "subscriber" in a particular subscription.
  * that it supports data federation among different providers.
The introduction of the concept of an End-User inside 3GPP as described in
section 5.3.1should be started in SA1:
  * Analysis of the general concepts.
  * Analysis of potential requirements regarding an End-User.
  * Description of the relationships between subscriber, user and end-user.
## 8.2 Introduce the Concept of a Contract
The scope of the concept of a contract should be
  * that it is supported by all vendors providing a common contract model to providers and
  * that it supports data federation among different providers.
In order to understand the type of contract a contract holder is representing,
analysis should be started in SA1:
  * Analyse, which information needs to come into a common object model
  * Analyse, whether TMF's concepts [95] -- [98] could be used
## 8.3 Introduce a network function "Common Profile Store (CPS)"
The scope of the concept of a CPS should be
  * That it provides a logically centralized, physically possibly distributed, service-independent storage of data related to end-users.
  * That it provides network elements that implement services, as well as enterprise applications concerned with end-user data, with access to the relevant parts of that end-user-related data.
  * that it is supported by all vendors providing a common contract model to providers and
  * that it supports data federation among different providers.
In order to introduce a Common Profile Storage Framework according to section
6 of the TR analysis should be started in SA2:
  * The definition of such a logical network element
  * The definition of additional interfaces between the CPSF NE and the network functions
  * The description of impacts on the existing 3GPP NEs and network architecture
###### ### Annex A: Example for the realization of an end-user database
according to the Common Profile Storage Framework
This annex shows the realization of an end-user database according to clauses
5 and 6 of this TR using ITU-T\'s Recommendation X.500 [89] as a basis.
Clause A.1 will introduce the rough structure of two network applications, how
they might form a common model and some notions about the requirements for an
adaptation layer. The example intentionally chooses a hypothetical deployment
of a scenario, which has a mixture of 3GPP-R4 and 3GPP-R6 components, in order
to demonstrate the capability to be backwards compatible.
Clause A.2 will introduce the corresponding network architecture showing one
possibility to realize a distributed central database using the X.500 network
structure and LDAP v3 as access protocol [88].
# A.1 The Model Structure
The basic scenario selected for the model example is the existence of an HLR
according to 3GPP-R4 and an HSS according to 3GPP-R6, which contains the
functionality required for R6 which is not already realized within the HLR.
X.500 [89] defines - from a model point of view - the basics for a directory
like information base. The following figure shows some of the crucial
elements, for details please refer to [89].
Figure A.1.1: X.500 Directory Information Tree - DIT
Figure A.1.1 shows the structure and the contents of an instantiated X.500
schema. Data are collected into entries (which are instantiated object
classes) and these entries are organized in a tree like fashion into the
Directory Information Tree (DIT). The building blocks of the object classes in
the schema definition are attributes, whose types and values for the basis of
the entries in the DIT.
One specific type of entry, which can be seen in figure A.1.1 is the \"Alias\"
entry, which performs a redirect to another entry within the tree.
The following figure shows the rough structure of a possible instantiation of
an X.500 based HLR schema.
Figure A.1.2: X.500 based HLR DIT for a multi-numbering subscriber
The model in figure A.1.2 shows three parts (only the entry names, no
attribute values):
  * Common part:
\- Root: Common to the whole DIT.
\- SSSD: Subscriber Specific Service Data, is root of the part of the DIT,
which is concerned with individual subscriber/end-user data.
\- UID: End-user identity, containing data specific for this end-user.
\- NSS: Network Supporting Services, is the root node for all Network
Supporting Services (see clause 5).
\- Services: is the root node for the end-user data, which are transmitted
(e.g. in the course of a Location Update), but which are common to many end-
users (and maybe also to more than one network function or enterprise
application).
\- OCSI: CAMEL Subscription Information for a Mobile Originated Call (with
respective instances below).
  * Direct Access part:
\- The Aliases have been described as possibilities to define a redirect. This
fact can be used to model fast accesses. In the above example aliases for
MISISDNs and IMSIs lead to the respective end-user instance, exactly to the
service needed.
  * HLR specific part: The entries represent a part of a multi-number > and GPRS enabled post-paid mobile end-user.
\- IMSI: represents the root of the 2G/2.5G end-user information, with the
respective properties below it.
The next figure represents the delta-HSS model as discussed at the beginning
of this clause.
Figure A.1.3: X.500 based HSS DIT
The grouping is the same as in the HLR case in figure A.1.2.
  * Common part: see explanations to figure A.1.2.
  * Direct Access part:
\- Additional Aliases for the private and public userid have been added.
  * HSS specific part: The entries represent a part of an end-user > subscribing e.g. to a presence service:
\- SubscriptionId: represents the root of the HSS end-user information, with
the respective properties below it.
The next figure shows a combined HLR-HSS DIT.
Figure A.1.4: X.500 based combined HLR and HSS DIT
When combining the two models, a few points become obvious:
  * The wish to keep data redundancy at a minimum leads to the fact that > both network functions (HLR and HSS) use the same fast access for > IMSI and MSISDN. As these pointers are unique they can only point > either to SUBSCRIPTIONID or to IMSI.
  * If one of the network functions has been there before the other, its > data model will change with the introduction of the next one > (figure A.1.4. shows that for the HSS a different handling of the > fast access for IMSI and MSISDN would be necessary, for HLR an > additional attribute in one of \"its\" entries is present).
  * In general, every addition of an object model for a new network > function or enterprise application could yield similar problems > and provoke changes both in the fragments of the end-user model > pertaining to the respective function as well as in the function > itself.
The three bullets above arising from a rather simplified example show the
necessity of an Adaptation Layer:
  * If data can be shared between network functions or enterprise > applications as discussed in clause 5, then they should only exist > once in the database.
  * Already running network functions or enterprise applications should > not be affected by the addition of new ones. So the data > structure, as far the function sees it, should not change.
So the Adaptation Layer has to posses mechanisms to:
  * Provide specific Adaptive Entities in order to simulate certain data > structures.
  * Ensure data integrity for all functions involved.
  * Provide standard access (in this case LDAP v3), which hides the fact > that an Adaptation Layer exists.
NOTE: In case of LDAP v3 any implementation of an Adaptation Layer would be
proprietary, whereas e.g. in case of SQL the Adaptation Layer would be
standardized for a greater part, as SQL99 officially supports view technology.
# A.2 The Network Architecture
In clause 6 properties of distributed databases were discussed in detail. This
clause will see a specific instance of one, namely an X.500 based database.
Figure A.2.1: X.500 based distributed database
Figure A.2.1 shows a distributed database as it is defined in X.500. It
supports the following communication protocols:
  * Directory Access Protocol (DAP): defines the exchange of requests > and outcomes between a DUA and a DSA (ITU-T).
  * Directory System Protocol (DSP): defines the exchange of requests > and outcomes between two DSAs (ITU-T).
  * Directory Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP): defines the > exchange of replication information between two DSAs that have > established shadowing agreements (ITU-T).
  * Directory Operational Binding Management Protocol (DOP): which > defines the exchange of administrative information between two > DSAs to administer operational bindings between them (ITU-T).
The DUA in figure A.2.1 is equivalent to the network functions and enterprise
applications discussed in this TR. The inter-DSA network provides:
  * One logical database, as the DUA only needs one access point > (requests are passed on internally using DSP).
  * The possibility to provide local \"shadow copies\" for fast read > access (using DISP).
  * The possibility to define data fragments for different DSAs.
As DAP is a fairly complex protocol, IETF developed a lightweight form of DAP,
which is easier to handle. The drawback was that originally it was only
intended as a client server application without any distribution. One of the
more frequent ways round this problem was to define a protocol mapping from
LDAP to DAP, which would allow the client a simple data handling and still
provide the distribution necessary (see figure A.2.2).
Figure A.2.2: LDAP in conjunction with an X.500 based distributed database
Lightweight DAP (LDAP): defines the exchange of requests and outcomes between
a DUA and a DSA (IETF).
NOTE: The directory definitions from ITU-T were originally not intended for
real-time and update intensive applications, so for the purposes of the
functions discussed in clause A.1 some observations are appropriate:
  * In order to minimize the number of redirects within the distributed > data base, all of the data requested by the DUA in one operation > (read or update)should be found on one DSA.
  * All information about the fast accesses as defined in clause A.1 > should be placed on the entry DSA of the DUA (which then gets a > kind of proxy function similar to the one described in clause 6, > figure 6.3.1.2).
