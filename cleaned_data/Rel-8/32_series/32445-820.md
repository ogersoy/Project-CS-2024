# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.441 \"Trace **Management Integration Reference Point (IRP):**
Requirements\"
32.442 \"Trace Management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Information
Service (IS)\"
32.443 \"Trace Management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)\"
**32.445: \"Trace Management Integration Reference Point (IRP): eXtensible
Markup Language (XML) file format definition\"**
The present document is part of a TS-family which describes the requirements
and information model necessary for the Telecommunication Management (TM) of
3G systems. The TM principles and TM architecture are specified in 3GPP TS
32.101 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [3].
Trace provides very detailed information on call level for a specific
subscriber or MS. This data is an additional information source to Performance
Measurements and allows deeper investigations in problems solving or in case
of optimization.
# 1 Scope
The present document is the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file format
definition of Trace IRP for the IRP whose semantics is specified in Trace IRP:
Information Service (3GPP TS 32.442 [3]).
This XML Definitions specification defines the XML syntax of the Trace IRP XML
Data File for the notifications related to Trace IRP. The XML file definitions
for a trace data file can be found in Annex A of 3GPP TS 32.423 [4].
This XML File Format Definition specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.442
V8.0.X.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**IRP:** See 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
**IRPAgent:** See 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
**IRPManager:** See 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
**XML file:** file containing an XML document
**XML document:** composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration
followed by a root XML element, see [4].
**XML declaration:** it specifies the version of XML being used, see [4].
**XML element:** has a type, is identified by a name, may have a set of XML
attribute specifications and is either composed of the succession of an XML
start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element followed by an XML
end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag; each XML element may
contain other XML elements, see [4].
**empty XML element:** having an empty XML content; an empty XML element still
possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an empty XML element is
either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag directly followed by an
XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag, see [4].
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag, see [4].
**XML start-tag:** the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute specifications
of the XML element, see [4].
**XML end-tag:** the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an XML end-
tag containing the name of the XML element, see [4].
**XML empty-element tag:** composed simply of an empty-element tag containing
the name and the set of XML attribute specifications of the XML element, see
[4].
**XML attribute specification:** has a name and a value, see [4].
**DTD:** defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML
document to be valid with regard to this DTD, see [4].
**XML schema:** more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema defines structure and
content constraints to be respected by an XML document to conform with this
XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML schemas can be used
together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself also an XML
document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas, see [5], [6]
and [7].
**XML namespace:** enables qualifying element and attribute names used in XML
documents by associating them with namespaces identified by different XML
schemas, see [5], [6] and [7].
**XML complex type:** defined in an XML schema; cannot be directly used in an
XML document; can be the concrete type or the derivation base type for an XML
element type or for another XML complex type; ultimately defines constraints
for an XML element on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML content,
see [5], [6] and [7].
**XML element type:** declared by an XML schema; can be directly used in an
XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element, directly or indirectly
defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML
content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base type for another
XML element type, see [5], [6] and [7].
