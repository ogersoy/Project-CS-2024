definition
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G-network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the NEs and NRs, and they may be initiated by the operator or
functions in the OSs or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as a single action on a Network Element (NE) of
the 3G-network or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
NEs.
The Itf-N interface for Configuration Management is built up by a number of
Integration Reference Points (IRPs) and a related Name Convention, which
realise the functional capabilities over this interface. The basic structure
of the IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].For CM, a
number of IRPs (and the Name Convention) are defined herein, used by this as
well as other technical specifications for telecom management produced by
3GPP.
# 1 Scope
The purpose of this _GERAN Network Resources IRP: CORBA Solution Set_ is to
define the mapping of the IRP information model (see 3GPP TS 32.652 [4]) to
the protocol specific details necessary for implementation of this IRP in a
CORBA/IDL environment.
This Solution Set specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.652 V8.1.X.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For terms and definitions refer to TS 32.101 [1], TS 32.102 [2], TS 32.600 [3]
and TS 32.652 [4].
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations apply:
CORBA Common Object Request Broker Architecture
DN Distinguished Name
IS Information Service
IDL Interface Definition Language
IOC Information Object Class
IRP Integration Reference Point
MO Managed Object
MOC Managed Object Class
NRM Network Resource Model
SS Solution Set
# 4 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of GERAN Network Resources IRP is specified
in TS 32.652 [4].\ This clause specifies features that are specific to the
CORBA SS.
## 4.1 Notifications
Notifications are sent according to the Notification IRP: CORBA SS (see TS
32.303 [5]).
# 5 Mapping
## 5.1 General mappings
Attributes modelling associations as defined in the NRM (here also called
\"reference attributes\") are in this SS mapped to attributes. The names of
the reference attributes in the NRM are mapped to the corresponding attribute
names in the MOC. When the cardinality for an association is 0..1 or 1..1 the
datatype for the reference attribute is defined as an MOReference. The value
of an MO reference contains the distinguished name of the associated MO. When
the cardinality for an association allows more than one referred MO, the
reference attribute will be of type MOReferenceSet, which contains a sequence
of MO references.

# 6 Rules for management information model extensions
This clause discusses how the models and IDL definitions provided in the
present document can be extended for a particular implementation, and still
remain compliant with 3GPP SA5's specifications.
## 6.1 Allowed extensions
Vendor-specific IOCs may be supported. The vendor-specific IOCs may support
new types of attributes. The 3GPP SA5-specified notifications may be issued
referring to the vendor-specific IOCs and vendor-specific attributes. New MOCs
shall be distinguishable from 3GPP SA5 IOCs by name. 3GPP SA5-specified and
vendor-specific attributes may be used in vendor-specific IOCs. Vendor-
specific attribute names shall be distinguishable from existing attribute
names.
NRM IOCs may be subclassed. Subclassed IOCs shall maintain the specified
behaviour of the 3GPP SA5's superior classes. They may add vendor-specific
behaviour with vendor-specific attributes. When subclassing, naming attributes
cannot be changed. The subclassed IOC shall support all attributes of its
superior class. Vendor-specific attributes cannot be added to 3GPP SA5 NRM
IOCs without subclassing.
When subclassing, the 3GPP SA5-specified containment rules and their specified
cardinality shall still be followed.\ As an example, ManagementNode (or its
subclasses) shall be contained under SubNetwork (or its subclasses).
Managed Object Instances may be instantiated as CORBA objects. This requires
that the MOCs be represented in IDL. 3GPP SA5's NRM IOCs are not currently
specified in IDL, but may be specified in IDL for instantiation or subclassing
purposes. However, management information models should not require that
IRPManagers access the instantiated managed objects other than through
supported methods in the present document.
Extension rules related to notifications (Notification categories, Event
Types, Extended Event Types etc.) are for further study in 3GPP's Releases 5.
## 6.2 Extensions not allowed
The IDL specifications in the present document cannot be edited or altered.
Any additional IDL specifications shall be specified in separate IDL files.
IDL interfaces (note: not IOCs) specified in the present document may not be
subclassed or extended. New interfaces may be defined with vendor-specific
methods.
