# 5 Charging in the evolved 3GPP system
## 5.1 Charging for 3GPP accesses
### 5.1.1 Non-roaming case
#### 5.1.1.1 Use case definition and architecture
In this use case the subscriber is within the HPLMN with 3GPP E-UTRAN or 3GPP
2G/3G access to the network.\ The network architecture for this use case is
specified in clause 4.2.1 in TS 23.401 [3], and also depicted in clause 4.2.1
of the present document.
#### 5.1.1.2 Key issues
##### 5.1.1.2.1 Key issue #1 "Location of PCEF functionality"
A solution for Policy and Charging Control in EPC is based on the Rel-7 PCC.
One of the main functions of the PCC is the PCEF (see TS 23.203 [8] for
details). PCEF has the connection to the PCRF over Gx and connections to the
offline and online charging systems over Gz and Gy, respectively.
As the PCEF functionality encompasses service data flow detection, policy
enforcement and flow based charging functionalities, it is logical to have the
PCEF functionality within the P-GW which terminates the SGi interface towards
the PDN. Since all user plane traffic will be going through the P-GW, there is
no need to have the functionality e.g. in the S-GW. Also, the P-GW will not
change within a session, whereas the S-GW may change. Therefore in the EPC
architecture (see TS 23.401 [3] for details) the PCEF functionality shall
reside in the P-GW. P-GW will not change within a session.
As the P-GW shall also support existing 2G/3G access it is logical to utilize
exiting PS charging architecture (see TS 32.251 [6] for details) in P-GW. The
Ga and Bx reference points include the required functionality defined for the
Gz reference point and the Ro reference point and application as specified in
TS 32.299 [12] include the functionality defined for the Gy reference point.
Editor\'s Note: SA2 is currently discussing the second PCEF in the S-GW.
#### 5.1.1.3 Conclusions
##### 5.1.1.3.1 Conclusions on Key issue #1 "Location of PCEF functionality"
The PCEF shall reside in the P-GW, having a connection to the Online Charging
System over Gy, and a connection to the CGF/Billing Domain over Gz/Bx.
#### 5.1.1.4 Open issues
Editor\'s Note: For Further Study
### 5.1.2 Home Routed Roaming cases
#### 5.1.2.1 Use case definition and architecture
In this use case the subscriber is roaming in a VPLMN with 3GPP E-UTRAN or
3GPP 2G/3G access to the network, and user plane traffic is routed to the
HPLMN. The network architecture for this use case is specified in clause 4.2.2
in TS 23.401 [3], and also depicted in clause 4.2.1 in the present document.
Other possible roaming scenarios are described in clause 5.1.3.
#### 5.1.2.2 Key issues
##### 5.1.2.2.1 Key issue #1 "Location of PCEF functionality"
The solution for Policy and Charging Control in EPC is based on the Rel-7 PCC.
One of the main functions of the PCC is the PCEF (see TS 23.203 [8] for
details). PCEF has the connection to the PCRF over Gx and connections to the
offline and online charging systems over Gz and Gy, respectively.
As the PCEF functionality encompasses service data flow detection, policy
enforcement and flow based charging functionalities, it is logical to have the
PCEF functionality within the P-GW, which terminates the SGi interface towards
the PDN. In this use case, where user plane traffic is routed to the HPLMN,
the SGi interface is terminated in the HPLMN P-GW.
Since all user plane traffic will be going through the HPLMN P-GW, there is no
need to have the PCEF functionality in the VPLMN S-GW. Also, the P-GW will not
change within a session, whereas the S-GW may change. Therefore in the EPC
architecture (see TS 23.401 [3] for details), in roaming cases with home
routed traffic and 3GPP E-UTRAN or 3GPP 2G/3G access, the PCEF functionality
shall reside in the HPLMN P-GW.
The charging architecture in the HPLMN P-GW shall utilize the existing PS
Charging architecture as in non-roaming cases (see clause 5.1.1 in the present
document).
##### 5.1.2.2.2 Key issue #2 "Inter-operator charging"
In this use case the VPLMN operator may wish to produce bearer level charging
information to be used for inter-operator charging (settlements). The logical
place for doing this is the VPLMN S-GW, which terminates the S8a interface
towards the HPLMN P-GW.
#### 5.1.2.3 Conclusions
##### 5.1.2.3.1 Conclusions on Key issue #1 "Location of PCEF functionality"
The PCEF shall reside in the HPLMN P-GW, having a connection to the Online
Charging System over Gy, and a connection to the CGF/Billing Domain over Gz/Bx
irrespective of the mobility protocol in operation in the home routed case.
##### 5.1.2.3.2 Conclusions on Key issue #2 "Inter-operator charging"
The VPLMN operator may produce bearer level charging data for inter-operator
charging (settlements) in the VPLMN S-GW.
#### 5.1.2.4 Open issues
Editor\'s Note: For Further Study
### 5.1.3 Local Breakout Roaming case
#### 5.1.3.1 Use case definition and architecture
In this use case the subscriber is roaming in a VPLMN with 3GPP E-UTRAN or
3GPP 2G/3G access to the network, and user plane traffic breaks out locally in
the VPLMN. The network architecture for this use case is specified in clause
4.2.2 in TS 23.401 [3], and also depicted in clause 4.2.1 in the present
document.
As discussed in clause 5.1.2, the solution for Policy and Charging Control in
EPC is based on the Rel-7 PCC. One of the main functions of the PCC is the
PCEF (see TS 23.203 [8] for details). PCEF has the connection to the PCRF over
S7 (Gx) and connections to the offline and online charging systems over Gz and
Gy, respectively. As the PCEF functionality encompasses service data flow
detection, policy enforcement and flow based charging functionalities, it is
logical to have the PCEF functionality within the P-GW, which terminates the
SGi interface towards the PDN. Since all user plane traffic will be going
through the P-GW, there is no need to have the PCEF functionality in the S-GW.
Also, the P-GW will not change within a session, whereas the S-GW may change.
#### 5.1.3.2 Key issues
##### 5.1.3.2.1 Key issue #1 "Location of online and offline charging systems"
In this use case, where, in roaming cases, user plane traffic breaks out in
the VPLMN, the PCEF functionality shall reside in the VPLMN P-GW.
As the PCEF has connections to the offline and online charging systems over Gz
and Gy, respectively, and, as in this use case the PCEF is in the P-GW in the
VPLMN, there is a question over the location of the offline and online
charging systems. Are they in the HPLMN or the VPLMN?
**Online charging (OCS) and Offline charging (CGF/Billing domain) in the
HPLMN**
This implies that the Gz (or Bx) and Gy reference points would need to be
inter-PLMN. This will introduce security and trust questions, but does keep
the subscriber knowledge in the HPLMN.
The knowledge of the addresses of the OCS and CGF may not be available if the
Rx+ interface is from the visited network.
**Online charging (OCS) and Offline charging (CGF/Billing domain) in the
VPLMN**
This implies that the Gz (or Bx) and Gy reference points would continue to be
intra-PLMN.
It could mean that knowledge about the subscriber account would need to be
available in the VPLMN's OCS -- could this be achieved by means of visited OCS
communication with the home OCS? This communication is not currently defined.
Alternatively, the visited OCS could communicate with the home OCS which would
continue to perform the online charging. This communication is not currently
defined and how does the visited OCS know the home OCS?
For offline charging, there would need to be sharing of CDRs with TAP
(Transferred Account Procedure) between the two operators' billing domains.
The knowledge of the addresses of the OCS and CGF would not be available if
the Rx+ interface is from the home network, but these can be pre-configured in
the PCEF.
Editor\'s Note: Of course, there is no need for the same strategy to be
adopted for online as for offline charging.
#### 5.1.3.3 Conclusions
##### 5.1.3.3.1 Conclusions on Key issue #1 "Location of online and offline
charging systems"
Both possible options for the location of the online and offline charging
systems have challenges and would require extensions to the existing charging
architecture.
#### 5.1.3.4 Open issues
The location of the offline and online charging systems with local breakout
(in visited or home network) needs to be determined. Possibly both options
will need to be standardised.
The mechanism for online charging with the OCS in the visited network needs to
be determined.
## 5.2 Charging for non-3GPP accesses
### 5.2.1 Non-roaming case
#### 5.2.1.1 Use case definition and architecture
In this use case the subscriber is within the HPLMN with any of the following
accesses to the network:
a) a trusted non-3GPP access with S2a interface to the P-GW;
b) a non-trusted non-3GPP access with a Wn* interface to the ePDG, and a S2b
interface from the ePDG to the P-GW;
c) a connection over the S2c interface from the UE to the P-GW over trusted or
non-trusted non-3GPP access or 3GPP access.
The network architecture for this use case is specified in clause 4.2.1 in TS
23.402 [4], and also depicted in clause 4.2.2 in the present document.
#### 5.2.1.2 Key issues
##### 5.2.1.2.1 Key issue #1 "Location of PCEF functionality"
The solution for Policy and Charging Control in EPC is based on the Rel-7 PCC.
One of the main functions of the PCC is the PCEF (see TS 23.203 [8] for
details). PCEF has the connection to the PCRF over Gx and connections to the
offline and online charging systems over Gz and Gy, respectively.
As the PCEF functionality encompasses service data flow detection, policy
enforcement and flow based charging functionalities, it is logical to have the
PCEF functionality within the P-GW which terminates the SGi interface towards
the PDN. In this use case the P-GW also terminates the S2a, S2b and S2c
interfaces (see clause 5.2.1.1) in the three access scenarios.
Thus, in the EPC architecture (see TS 23.402 [4] for details) for non-roaming
cases with non-3GPP accesses, the PCEF functionality shall reside in the P-GW.
In Rel-7 the PDG had PCEF charging functionality, but since all user plane
traffic going through the ePDG will also be going through the P-GW in this use
case, there is no need to have the PCEF charging functionality in the ePDG.
Editor's note: It should be verified if the PCRF will communicate with only
one instance of PCEF in the P-GW.
The charging architecture in the P-GW shall utilize the existing PS charging
architecture as in non-roaming cases for 3GPP accesses (see clause 5.1.1 of
the present document).
Editor's note: It may be necessary to carry some access information over the
S2x interfaces to the P-GW for charging purposes.
#### 5.2.1.3 Conclusions
##### 5.2.1.3.1 Conclusions on Key issue #1 "Location of PCEF functionality"
The PCEF shall reside in the P-GW, having a connection to the Online Charging
System over Gy, and a connection to the CGF/Billing Domain over Gz/Bx.
#### 5.2.1.4 Open issues
Editor\'s Note: For Further Study
### 5.2.2 Roaming cases
#### 5.2.2.1 Use case definition and architecture
In this use case the subscriber is roaming in a VPLMN with user plane traffic
routed to the HPLMN. The subscriber's access to the VPLMN is any of the
following:
a) a trusted non-3GPP access with S2a interface to the VPLMN S-GW or to the
HPLMN P-GW;
b) a non-trusted non-3GPP access with a Wn* interface to the VPLMN ePDG, and
an S2b interface from the VPLMN ePDG to the VPLMN S-GW or to the HPLMN P-GW;
c) a connection over the S2c interface from the UE to the VPLMN S-GW or to the
HPLMN P-GW over trusted or non-trusted non-3GPP access or 3GPP access.
The network architecture for this use case is specified in clause 4.2.2 in TS
23.402 [4], and also depicted in clause 4.2.2 in the present document.
Editor's note: Other possible roaming scenarios are currently studied in SA2.
#### 5.2.2.2 Key issues
##### 5.2.2.2.1 Key issue #1 "Location of PCEF functionality"
The solution for Policy and Charging Control in EPC is based on the Rel-7 PCC.
One of the main functions of the PCC is the PCEF (see TS 23.203 [8] for
details). PCEF has the connection to the PCRF over Gx and connections to the
offline and online charging systems over Gz and Gy, respectively.
As the PCEF functionality encompasses service data flow detection, policy
enforcement and flow based charging functionalities, it is logical to have the
PCEF functionality within the P-GW, which terminates the SGi interface towards
the PDN. In this use case the user plane traffic is routed to the HPLMN P-GW,
either directly across the S2x interface or through the VPLMN S-GW (across the
S8b interface between the VPLMN S-GW and the HPLMN P-GW). The SGi interface is
thus terminated in the HPLMN P-GW.
Since all user plane traffic will be going through the HPLMN P-GW, there is no
need to have the PCEF functionality in the VPLMN S-GW. Also, the P-GW will not
change within a session, whereas the S-GW may change. Therefore in the EPC
architecture (see TS 23.402 [4] for details), in roaming cases with home
routed traffic and with any of the accesses listed above in clause 5.2.2.1,
the PCEF functionality shall reside in the HPLMN P-GW.
The current draft of TS 23.402 [4] has PCRF in the VPLMN with a connection to
the VPLMN S-GW. However, in this use case it is not needed for any charging
purposes, because subscriber charging can be produced in the HPLMN P-GW.
In Rel-7 the PDG had PCEF charging functionality, but since all user plane
traffic going through the VPLMN ePDG will also be going through the HPLMN P-GW
in this use case, there is no need to have the PCEF charging functionality in
the VPLMN ePDG.
The charging architecture in the HPLMN P-GW shall utilize the existing PS
charging architecture as in non-roaming cases for 3GPP accesses (see clause
5.1.1 in the present document).
Editor's note: It may be necessary to carry some access information over the
interfaces towards the HPLMN P-GW for charging purposes.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Key issue #2 "Inter-operator charging"
In this use case the VPLMN operator may wish to produce bearer level charging
information to be used for inter-operator charging (settlements). The logical
place for doing this is the VPLMN S-GW, which terminates the S8b interface
towards the HPLMN P-GW.
#### 5.2.2.3 Conclusions
##### 5.2.2.3.1 Conclusions on Key issue #1 "Location of PCEF functionality"
The PCEF shall reside in the HPLMN P-GW, having a connection to the Online
Charging System over Gy, and a connection to the CGF/Billing Domain over
Gz/Bx.
##### 5.2.2.3.2 Conclusions on Key issue #2 "Inter-operator charging"
The VPLMN operator may produce volume based bearer level charging data for
inter-operator charging (settlements) in the VPLMN S-GW.
#### 5.2.2.4 Open issues
Editor\'s Note: For Further Study
##### 5.2.2.4.1 Open issues on Key issue #1 "Location of PCEF functionality"
The S7 interface between VPLMN S-GW to the VPLMN vPCRF is not needed for
charging in the home routed traffic case.
##### 5.2.2.4.2 Open issues on Key issue #2 "Inter-operator charging"
The direct communication between the VPLMN ePDG to the HPLM P-GW as specified
in TS 23.402 [4] may prevent the generation of bearer charging charging
information by the VPLMN.
### 5.3 Mobility cases
Editor's note: This clause should cover inter-access system mobility cases
independent of roaming.
#### 5.3.1 Use case definition and architecture
In this use case the subscriber is within the HPLMN and has IP access to the
network from one of the evolved packet system supported accesses (i.e. 3GPP
E-UTRAN, 3GPP 2G/3G or 3GPP / non-3GPP IP). The network architecture for this
use case is specified in clause 4.2.1 in TS 23.402 [4], and also depicted in
clause 4.2.2 in the present document.
#### 5.3.2 Key issues
#### 5.3.2.1 Key issue #1 "Inter-access correlation"
Mobility is supported between any of the evolved packet system supported
accesses. I.e. a user may switch between any of the supported accesses and
will expect to continue existing session. The session is anchored at the S-GW
for local mobility between non-3GPP accesses and at the P-GW for mobility
between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
There will be a need to be able to seamlessly charge (both online and offline)
across the various mobility options, while information could be needed on the
type of access to allow the application of different charging rates for each
access type.
The P-GW remains constant, so any changes in the access must be recorded in
the charging records for offline charging and must trigger event or update
messages for the Online Charging System if charging is performed at the P-GW.
#### 5.3.3 Conclusions
If charging occurs at the S-GW or ePDG, then a correlation mechanism would be
needed to allow the records from different Sâ€‘GW or ePDG involved with the same
session to be recognised as being associated together at the OCS or Billing
Domain.
#### 5.3.4 Open issues
The mechanism for inter-access correlation needs to be identified.
# 6 Recommendations
## 6.1 Recommendations for work item and specification structure
It is recommended that a new WID 'EPC Charging' below the Feature WID '3GPP
System Architecture Evolution Specification' will cover the standardisation of
the charging aspects of Evolved Packet System.
The existing specifications for the charging aspects of TS 32.251 for PS-
domain and TS 32.252 for WLAN should be extended for the Evolved Packet
System. Changes will also be needed to the charging architecture specification
in TS 32.240 as well as for the OCS architecture in TS 32.296 and the
corresponding enhancements in the charging protocol specifications (TS 32.298
and TS 32.299).
## 6.2 Recommendations for charging requirements and principles
No changes will be required.
## 6.3 Recommendations for charging architecture
The charging architecture will need to be modified to cater for the P-GW and
thus the PCEF being in the visited network. Full PCEF with service-aware flow-
based charging is located only in P-GW.
## 6.4 Recommendations for charging data and protocols
Some changes will be required to the charging data to take into account the
new information available due to the different mobility models. The scope of
these changes should not be large. Changes will also be required to the
Transferred Account Procedure (TAP) for subscriber charging in case of Local
Breakout.
