# Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.671: Configuration Management (CM); State Management Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Requirements
32.672: Configuration Management (CM); State Management Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)
**32.673: Configuration Management (CM); State Management Integration
Reference Point (IRP); Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
Solution Set (SS)**
**32.675:** Configuration Management (CM); **State Management Integration
Reference Point (IRP); Bulk CM eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file format
definition**
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of a deployment program (e.g. additions
and deletions), as part of an optimisation program (e.g. modifications), and
to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM actions are initiated
either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G network, or as part of a
complex procedure involving actions on many resources/objects in one or
several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the CORBA Solution Set (SS) for the IRP whose
semantics is specified in State Management IRP: Information Service (IS) (3GPP
TS 32.672 [2]).
Clause 1 to 3 provides background information. Clause 4 provides key
architectural features supporting the SS. Clause 5 defines the mapping of
operations, notification, parameters and attributes defined in IS to their SS
equivalents. Annex A contains the IDL specification.
This Solution Set specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.672 V8.0.X.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions, which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.
[1] 3GPP TS 32.311: \"Telecommunication management; Generic Integration
Reference Point (IRP) management; Requirements\".
[2] 3GPP TS 32.672: \"Telecommunication management; Configuration Management
(CM); State Management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Information Service
(IS)\".

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions defined in
3GPP TS 32.672 [2] apply. There are no additional definitions applicable to
the present document.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations apply:
CORBA Common Object Request Broker Architecture
IDL Interface Definition Language
IOC Information Object Class
IRP Integration Reference Point
IS Information Service
NE Network Element
OMG Object Management Group
SS Solution Set
## 3.3 IRP document version number string
The IRP document version number (sometimes called \"IRP version\" or \"version
number\") string is used to identify this specification. The definition of
\"IRP document version number string\" in 3GPP TS 32.311 [1] provides the rule
to derive such a string.
As the State Management IRP IS as defined in 3GPP TS 32.672 [2] does not
specify operations & notification (only State Management related data
definitions), this string definition is stated here for potential future use
only.
# 4 Architectural Features
The overall architectural feature of State Management IRP is specified in 3GPP
TS 32.672 [2].
For this release there are no features identified that are specific to the
CORBA SS.
# 5 Mapping
## 5.1 IOC Mapping
Table 1 provides the mapping of the information object classes defined in the
IS of the State Management IRP [2] to the equivalent of this CORBA Solution
Set.
Table 1: Mapping of IOCs
* * *
IOCs defined in State Management IRP IS [2] CORBA SS Method
StateManagementEntity No mapping applicable for this \> class.
* * *
## 5.2 Mapping of Attributes
Table 2 provides the mapping of the IOC attributes defined in the IS of the
State Management IRP [2] to their equivalents in this CORBA Solution Set. As
[2] specified the Support Qualifier for these attributes as not applicable,
mappings towards Mandatory and Optional are provided.
