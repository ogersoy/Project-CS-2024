The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor E-UTRAN and EPC
system.
During the lifetime of an E-UTRAN, its logical and physical configuration will
undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise the
utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed through
network configuration management activities and/or network engineering, see TS
32.600 [3].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of an E-UTRAN require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document is to describe the mechanisms
involved in the collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
Annex B of TS 32.404 helps in the definition of new performance measurements
that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and inclusion in the
present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 discusses a top-down performance
measurement definition methodology that focuses on how the end-user of
performance measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for E-UTRAN.
TS 32.401 [5] describes Performance Management concepts and requirements.
The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of an E-UTRAN.
Only measurement types that are specific to E-UTRAN are defined within the
present documents. Vendor specific measurement types used in E-UTRAN are not
covered. Instead, these could be applied according to manufacturer\'s
documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) shall only be
referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need identified for
the existence of such a reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to eNodeB);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. RRC connection setup related
measurements);
\- Header 3: Measurements.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Use cases for performance measurements
defintion
This annex provides the concrete use cases for the E-UTRAN performance
measurements defined in clause 4.
# A.1 Monitor of call(/session) setup performance
Call(/session) setup is one of most important step to start delivering
services by the networks to users.
The success or failure of a call(/session) setup directly impacts the quality
level for delivering the service by the networks, and also the feeling of the
end user. So the success or failure of call(/session) setup needs be
monitored, this can be achieved by the calculation of call setup success rate
which gives a direct view to evaluate the call setup performance, and the
analysis of the specific reason causing the failure to find out the problem
and ascertain the solutions.
In addition, the time duration of the call(/session) setup need to be
monitored as it impacts the end user experience, and by comparison with
operator's benchmark requirements, the optimization may be required according
the performance.
And due to different priority and tolerance for different service type with
different OoS level in the networks, the monitor needs to be opened on each
service type and OoS level.
To complete the call(/session) setup procedure, E-UTRAN is mainly responsible
for the establishment of radio and S1 signaling connection and service bearer
by the RRC connection establishment (See 3GPP TS 36.331[8]), RRC connection
reestablishment after RRC connection dropped due to some reasons like radio
link failure or handover failure etc (See 3GPP TS 36.331[8]) E-RAB setup (See
3GPP TS 36.413[9]) and Initial UE Context Setup (See 3GPP TS 36.413[9])
procedure.
To support the monitor of success or failure of the call(/session) setup, the
performance measurements related to RRC connection establishment (See 3GPP TS
36.331[8]), RRC connection reestablishment (See 3GPP TS 36.331[8]) procedure,
and the performance measurements related to E-RAB setup (See 3GPP TS
36.413[9]) and Initial UE Context Setup (See 3GPP TS 36.413[9]) procedure for
each QoS level are required To support the monitor of time duration of setup
call(/session) setup, the performance measurements related to RRC connection
setup time and E-RAB setup time are required.
# A.2 Monitor of E-RAB release
E-RAB is the key and limited resource for E-UTRAN to deliver services. The
release of the E-RAB needs to be monitored as:
\- an abnormal release of the E-RAB will cause the call(/session) drop, which
directly impacts the QoS delivered by the networks, and the satisfaction
degree of the end user;
\- a successfully released E-RAB can be used to setup other requested
calls(/sessions). The E-RAB failed to be released will still occupy the
limited resource and hence it can not be used to admit other requested
calls(/sessions).
The specific reason causing the abnormal and failed release of the E-RAB is
required in order to find out the problem and ascertain the solutions. And due
to different priority and tolerance for different service type with different
OoS level in the networks, the monitor needs to be opened on each service type
with OoS level.
The E-RAB can be released by E-RAB Release procedure (See 3GPP TS 36.413[9]) ,
UE Context Release procedure (See 3GPP TS 36.413[9] and 3GPP TS 36.423[10])
procedure, Reset procedure(See 3GPP TS 36.413[9]) either initiated by eNodeB
or MME, Path Switch procedure (See 3GPP TS 36.413[9]) and Intra-eNB HO
procedure (See 3GPP TS 36.331[8]).
So performance measurements related to E-RAB Release (See 3GPP TS 36.413[9])
and UE Context Release (See 3GPP TS 36.413[9]) procedure for each service type
with QoS level are necessary to support the monitor of E-RAB release.
# A.3 Monitor of E-RAB level QoS modification
When an E-RAB has been established, the QoS it experiences in the E-UTRAN is
dependent upon the E-RAB level QoS parameters established for the bearer,
together with settings of other bearers established in the same cell. If the
QoS experienced by a bearer does not meet the expected performance, or the
resource need be reassigned for other bearers, the E-RAB level QoS may be
adjusted (typically with a knock-on effect onto other bearers).
So the modification of E-RAB level QoS parameters needs to be monitored, and
due to different priority and tolerance for different service type with
different OoS level in the networks, the monitor needs to be opened on each
target service type with OoS level.
The E-RAB level QoS can be modified by E-RAB Modify procedure (see 3GPP TS
36.413[9]), _in which the MME entity instructs the eNodeB to change one or
more QoS parameters on an E-RAB using the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message. The
eNodeB typically makes the adjustments as instructed (and adjusts the RRM
applied to the bearer appropriately) but in some circumstances the bearer
modification can fail. The eNodeB returns an E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message
that tells the MME whether the modification was successful or not -- for an
unsuccessful modification a cause value is included. It is important for OAM
to measure the failure rate of the bearer modifications, this information can
be used, for example, to make adjustments to OAM CM settings._

# A.5 Monitor of cell level QoS and radio resource utilisation
In an E-UTRAN cell the quality of service achieved is directly influenced by a
number of factors, including:
  * Loading of users on the cell
  * Traffic loading and characteristics
  * UE locations and mobility
  * RRM policies
    * Scheduling
    * congestion control
    * admission control
    * layer 2 protocol configuration
  * Mapping of traffic to QCI
  * Setting of QoS parameters other than the QCI.
It is very important to be able to monitor the QoS to determine whether the
combined effect of these policies, algorithms and external factors is
satisfactory. Unsatisfactory QoS may rectified by adjusting policies and RRM
settings, for instance.
Cell bit-rate
A fundamental measure of QoS is the throughput (data rate) of the cell. The
total cell throughput measured across all radio bearers gives an indication of
the loading and activity in the cell. Adding a per QCI counter allows the
loading on the different QCIs to be measured. For example, if QCI 1 is used
exclusively for VoIP then the loading of conversational speech can be directly
determined. Finally, the maximum throughput can indicate to the operator
whether there is enough capacity in the network; for example, is the backhaul
sufficient. Separate counters should be configured on the downlink and uplink.
Complexity may be reduced by performing the counters at layer 3, giving the
ingress bit-rate to the eNB on the downlink and the egress bit-rate from the
eNB on the uplink.
Cell throughput includes both User Plane data and Control Plane data. To
support the User Plane data, necessary Control Plane data also need to be
transmitted. This Control Plane data although required, will not be perceived
(felt) by the User. The total cell throughput helps to evaluate the usage of
bandwidth and radio resource.
Operators ideally want to see the Control Plane data as small as possible when
compared to the User Plane data without compromising on the service.
Hence it is important to monitor the total cell throughput as well as how much
is occupied by Control Plane Data.
Number of actives UEs
It is also of interest to determine how many users are enjoying the throughput
numbers determined for each QCI. Therefore, we may count the number of users
that are active for each QCI -- here active users have data queued pending
transmission. A simple division of the throughput (data rate) of a QCI by the
number of active users on the QCI indicates the throughput per user on the
QCI. For example, taking QCI 1 this metric could indicate the typical codec
rate being employed in the cell. Alternatively, for QCI 9 supporting low
priority TCP-based traffic it can indicate the typical bandwidth pipe size for
a user when he has data to send / receive.
DL packet delay
Latency is of prime concern for some services, particularly conversational
services like speech and instant messaging. A counter is added to measure the
mean delay for IP packets incurred within the eNodeB. Separate counters are
provided per QCI which are particularly useful when the QCI is used by very
few services and the packet sizes vary little. It is only practical to measure
packet delays on the downlink.
DL packet drop rate
When a cell is heavily loaded congestion can take place. When congestion is
not severe the impact is typically the incurrence of additional delay for non-
GBR radio bearers. However, when congestion is severe the eNodeB may be forced
to discard packets. It is important for the operator to have visibility of
packet discard so that corrective action can be instigated (for example, by
adjusting admission control settings in the network). It is only practical to
measure packet discards on the downlink. Packet discards on handover should
not be included in the count.
PRB Usage
The resource utilisation, measured in terms of physical resource blocks
(PRBs), is a useful measure of whether a cell is lightly loaded or not.
Loading is a key input to network capacity planning and load balancing.
Furthermore, when resource utilisation per QCI is reported the distribution of
resources between different services can be estimated.
Downlink Air interface packet loss rate
The downlink air interface packet loss can be directly compared with the PELR
value of a QCI to see if the packet loss (over the air interface) aspect of
quality of service is being met within the cell (see [12] for more details on
PELR). On the downlink this measurement can be added to the congestion losses
(see DL packet drop rate) to determine the total packet loss rate at the
eNodeB. Consequently, the downlink useful bit-rate can be estimated by scaling
the measurement of the downlink PDCP ingress bit-rate by (1 -- DL packet drop
rate) (1 -- air interface packet loss rate).
Uplink packet loss rate
The uplink air interface packet loss rate (per QCI) can be compared directly
with the PELR defined for that QCI. An estimate of the uplink air interface
packet loss may be provided by the "Uplink PDCP SDU loss rate". This uplink
measurement is based on PDCP sequence numbers and cannot precisely measure the
air interface losses. Any packets discarded by the UE within the protocol
stack (i.e. at layer 2) are also counted since they will have been given a
PDCP sequence number. Discards at layer 3 are not counted.
RACH Usage
The RACH plays a vital role in the following procedures:
> \- Initial access from RRC_IDLE;
>
> \- Initial access after radio link failure;
>
> \- Handover requiring random access procedure;
>
> \- DL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access procedure;
>
> \- UL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access procedure;
Furthermore, the random access procedure takes two distinct forms:
> \- Contention based using a randomly selected preamble (applicable to all
> five events);
>
> \- Non-contention based using a dedicated preamble (applicable to only
> handover and DL data arrival).
In the use-case of RACH configuration optimization, received Random Access
Preambles are signaled across an OAM interface.
Monitoring of the preamble usage in a cell allows the operator to determine if
the resources allocated to the RACH by the eNodeB are appropriate for the
number of random access attempts. If the resources are underutilised then the
operator may reconfigure the eNodeB (via CM) to allocate less resource to RACH
thereby freeing up resource for other uplink transmissions. Alternatively, if
the resources are heavily utilised then this is indicative of RACH congestion
leading to increased latency for the procedures listed above.
The eNodeB can partition the RACH resource between dedicated preambles,
randomly selected preambles in group A and randomly selected preambles in
group B. This partitioning can be evaluated when usage measurements are made
on each set separately.
# A.6 Monitor of the number of connected users
The number of the connected users in each cell is valuable information for
operators to know how many uses are connecting to E-UTRAN per cell basis. This
kind of information can help operator to tune the admission control parameters
for the cell and to do load balancing between cells to ensure that the target
percentage or number the of users admitted achieve the target QoS.
# A.7 Monitoring of interference situation
In the LTE radio technology interference has to be coordinated on the basis
uplink and downlink i.e. in a coordinated usage of the UL resources (Physical
Resource Blocks, PRBs) and DL Transmitted Power, which lead to improve SIR and
corresponding throughput. These are achieved by means of mechanisms employing
channel quality indicators in support of scheduling/radio resource allocation
functions.
These RRM functions in the eNB require the setting of frequency / power
restrictions and preferences for the resource usage in the different cells.
Setting and updating these parameters is the task of a network optimisation
(done by operator or automatically by SON).
Use cases for the related interference measurements are e.g. optimisation of
ICIC related RRM functionality, the detection of long distance interferer and
the interference due to spurious emissions of neighbour cells. The later case
is assumed only in high load scenarios or unsufficent ICIC functionality due
to the the fact that ICIC functionality would minimise interference
autonomously if sufficient bandwidth is available.
The necessary measurements to identify and anylse the interference situation
as input for optimisation tasks has to be defined.
# A.8 Monitor of ARQ and HARQ performance
Reliable Packet Delivery is one of the important Performance factor for a
better User experience. HARQ retransmissions at the MAC layer ensure reliable
packet delivery
In addition, RLC can be configured to operate in acknowledged mode for those
applications that need very low packet drops and can tolerate a slightly
higher delay from RLC retransmissions.
If a MAC PDU is not delivered, HARQ takes care of retransmitting (upto a
maximum configurable number). If all the retransmissions fail at MAC layer,
and if RLC is configured to operate in acknowledged mode, RLC's ARQ mechanism
will take care of any residual packet errors.
It is important to\ a) maintain the block error rate or packet error rate
within tolerable limits
b) ensure that HARQ retransmissions take care of most packet errors, instead
of relying on RLC layer retransmissions (which would increase the delay).
So, it is important to monitor the performance of these schemes.\ ARQ
Performance if viewed at QCI level can help in monitoring the distribution for
each of the services.
HARQ Performance if viewed at MCS (Modulation Coded Scheme) can help in
monitoring the MCS Performance also.
# A.9 Monitor of RF performance
RF Performance reflects the cell loading levels and abnormal conditions.
In the Downlink, Power Resources are managed by the EUTRAN Cell(RAN).\ More
Power Resources may help in increasing the Capacity of the System. Hence,
there the power resources could be effectively used to optimize the Capacity
of the System.
Hence there is a need to keep monitoring the Power Resource Utilization in %
and also in absolute terms.
# A.10 Monitor of paging performance
In EUTRAN, Paging is under the control of the MME. When the MME wants to page
a UE it has to page it in all cells that belong to the TA(s) to which the UE
is registered.
The paging load per cell is an important measure for the operator as it allows
the operator to properly dimension the resources for paging in the E-UTRAN
Cell .
At an E-UTRAN Cell it makes sense to measure the number of discarded paging
messages if this is due to some problem in the eNodeB, such as paging occasion
overflow. In that scenario the periodicity of paging occasions can be
reconfigured in order to ensure that all paging messages are transmitted by
the eNodeB in the first available paging occasion, thereby avoiding paging
delays and extended call setup delay.
Operators need to know when such an event occurs, in order to identify if the
problem is at the E-UTRAN cell level or not.
