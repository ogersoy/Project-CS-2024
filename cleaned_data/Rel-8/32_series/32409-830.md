The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor 3G-system.
During the lifetime of a 3G network, its logical and physical configuration
will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise
the utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed
through network configuration management activities and/or network
engineering, see 3GPP TS 32.600 [3].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a 3G network require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document is to describe the mechanisms
involved in the collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements of IMS.
3GPP TS 32.401 [5] describes Performance Management concepts and requirements.
The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of an IMS network. These may be measurement types defined
within the present document, measurements defined within other standards
bodies, or vendor specific measurement types.
Only measurement types that are specific to IMS network are defined within the
present documents. I.e. vendor specific measurement types and measurements
related to \"external\" technologies used in IMS network, such as ATM or IP,
are not covered. Instead, these could be applied as described by the other,
\"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) or according to
manufacturer\'s documentation.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to CSCF);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. Registration related measurements);
\- Header 3: Measurements.
# 2 References

text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication > and/or edition number or version number) or nonâ€‘specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.

this time will then be divided by the number of successful IMS initial
registrations observed in the granularity period to give the arithmetic mean,
the accumulator shall be reinitialised at the beginning of each granularity
period. See 3GPP TS 23.228 [7].
