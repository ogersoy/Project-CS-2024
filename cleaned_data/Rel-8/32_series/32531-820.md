### 4.2.2 Specification level requirement on Automated SWM
**REQ_ASWM_FUN_1\** It shall be possible for an IRPManager to retrieve
\- information regarding how an NE or a group of NEs behaves during ASWM, i.e.
in which sequence the essential steps of ASWM are executed
\- information regarding where the IRPManager can interact with ASWM - by
suspending the ASWM process at one or more ASWM stop points.\ Steps, their
sequence and their stop point qualification are not imposed by the standard.
**REQ_ASWM_FUN_2\** If choices for stop points to suspend the SWM process are
offered, then it shall be possible for an IRPManager to choose/select among
them where it will suspend (stop) a SWM process (i.e. to ensure fulfillment of
pre-conditions for the step like the fulfillment of the presence of required
input data for the step).
The IRPManager shall be able to read or select or de-select the stop points
offered.
The IRPManager shall be informed about the availability of new SW, about the
creation and deletion of a profile which is a holder of information regarding
the offered SWM steps, the offered sequence of the steps and the configuration
steps stop points.
The IRPManager should be able to change the content of a created profile and
be informed about the change.
**REQ_ASWM_FUN_3\** It shall be possible for an IRPManager to resume a
suspended ASWM process.
**REQ_ASWM_FUN_4\** It shall be possible for IRPManager to retrieve
information about the progress of ASWM.
**REQ_ASWM_FUN_5\** The IRPAgent should send a notification when the ASWM
process
  * was suspended
  * was resumed
  * was terminated
**REQ_ASWM_FUN_6**
It shall be possible for an IRPManager to terminate a currently ongoing ASWM
process for one or multiple NEs. After a termination it is not possible to
resume the ASWM process.
**REQ_ASWM_FUN_7**
In order to declare the SW activation succeeded, a self test should have been
completed.
**REQ_ASWM_FUN_8**
If the software activation fails, information documenting the reasons for the
failure should be logged, to support the trouble shooting.
