# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.601: \"Configuration Management (CM); Basic CM Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Requirements\"
**32.602: \"Configuration Management (CM); Basic CM Integration Reference
Point (IRP): Information Service (IS)\"**
32.603: \"Configuration Management (CM); Basic CM Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)\"
32.607: \"Configuration Management (CM); Basic CM Integration Reference Point
(IRP); SOAP Solution Set (SS)\"
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines a component of an Integration Reference Point
(IRP) through which an \'IRPAgent\' (typically an Element Manager or Network
Element) can communicate basic Configuration Management related information to
one or several \'IRPManagers\' (typically Network Managers).
The function of this Basic CM IRP Information Service is to define an
interface for the retrieval and modification of Configuration Management
Information.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply. For terms and definitions not found here, please refer to 3GPP TS
32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.600 [6].
**Association** : In general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
(1) [name bindings]{.underline},
(2) [reference attributes]{.underline}, and
(3) [association objects]{.underline}.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams). Currently however, all (non-containment)
associations are modelled by means of reference attributes of the
participating MOs.
**Managed Element (ME)** : An instance of the Managed Object Class
G3ManagedElement.
**Managed Object (MO)** : In the context of the present document, a Managed
Object (MO) is a software object that encapsulates the manageable
characteristics and behaviour of a particular Network Resource. The MO is
instance of a MO class defined in a MIM/NRM. An MO class has
[attributes]{.underline} that provide information used to characterize the
objects that belong to the class. Furthermore, an MO class can have
[operations]{.underline} that represent the behaviour relevant for that class.
An MO class may support [notifications]{.underline} that provide information
about an event occurrence within a network resource.
**Management Information Base (MIB)** : A MIB is an instance of an NRM and has
some values on the defined attributes and associations specific for that
instance. In the context of the present document, an MIB consists of:
(1) a Name space (describing the MO containment hierarchy in the MIB through
Distinguished Names),
(2) a number of Managed Objects with their attributes and
(3) a number of Associations between these MOs. Also note that TMN (ITU-T
Recommendation X.710 [7]) defines a concept of a [Management Information
Tree]{.underline} (also known as a Naming Tree) that corresponds to the name
space (containment hierarchy) portion of this MIB definition. Figure 3.1
depicts the relationships between a Name space and a number of participating
MOs (the shown association is of a non-containment type)
Figure 3.1: Relationships between a Name space and a number of participating
MOs
**Management Information Model (MIM)** : Also referred to as NRM -- see the
definition below.
**Name space** : A name space is a collection of names. The IRP name
convention (see 3GPP TS 32.300 [5]) restricts the name space to a hierarchical
containment structure, including its simplest form - the one-level, flat name
space.\ All Managed Objects in a MIB shall be included in the corresponding
name space and the MIB/name space shall only support a strict hierarchical
containment structure (with one root object). A Managed Object that contains
another is said to be the superior (parent); the contained Managed Object is
referred to as the subordinate (child). The parent of all MOs in a single name
space is called a Local Root. The ultimate parent of all MOs of all managed
systems is called the Global Root.
**Network Resource Model (NRM)** : A model representing the actual managed
telecommunications network resources that a System is providing through the
subject IRP. An NRM describes Managed Object Classes, their associations,
attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as \"MIM\" (see above),
which originates from the ITU-T TMN.
**Node B:** A logical node responsible for radio transmission/reception in one
or more cells to/from the User Equipment.\ It terminates the Iub interface
towards the RNC.

# 4 System overview
## 4.1 System Context
The general definition of the System Context for the present IRP is found in
3GPP TS 32.150 [14] subclause 4.7.
In addition, the set of related IRP(s) relevant to the present IRP is shown in
the two diagrams below.
Figure 4.1: System Context A
Figure 4.2: System Context B
## 4.2 Compliance rules
For general definitions of compliance rules related to qualifiers
(Mandatory/Optional/Conditional) for _operations_ , _notifications_ _and_
_parameters_ (of operations and notifications) please refer to 3GPP TS 32.150
[14].
An IRPAgent that incorporates vendor-specific extensions shall support normal
communication with a 3GPP SA5â€‘compliant IRPManager with respect to all
Mandatory and Optional managed object classes, attributes, associations,
operations, parameters and notifications without requiring the IRPManager to
have any knowledge of the extensions.
Given that
  * rules for vendor-specific extensions remain to be fully specified, > and
  * many scenarios under which IRPManager and IRPAgent interwork may > exist,
it is recognised that the IRPManager, even though it is not required to have
knowledge of vendor-specific extensions, may be required to be implemented
with an awareness that extensions can exist and behave accordingly.

## 6.2 Class diagram
This clause introduces the set of Information Object Classes (IOCs) that
encapsulate information within the IRPAgent. The intent is to identify the
information required for the BasicCmIRP Agent implementation of its operations
and notification emission. This sub-clause provides the overview of all
support object classes in UML. Subsequent sub-clauses provide more detailed
specification of various aspects of these support object classes.

## 7.2 Generic rules
**Rule 1** : Each operation with at least one input parameter supports a pre-
condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**Rule 2** : Each operation with at least one optional input parameter
supports a set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where
\"xxx\" is the name of the optional input parameter and the pre-condition
indicates that the operation supports the named optional input parameter.
Additionally, each such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**Rule 3** : Each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem that is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.
## 7.3 Interface PassiveCmIRPOperations#1
### 7.3.1 getMoAttributes (M)
#### 7.3.1.1 Definition
This operation is invoked by IRPManager to request the retrieval of management
information (Managed Object attribute names and values) from the MIB
maintained by IRPAgent. One or several Managed Objects may be retrieved -
based on the containment hierarchy. This operation provides functionality that
is similar to that provided by the M-GET service defined by CMIS (ITU-T
Recommendation X.710 [7]).\ A Solution Set may choose to split this operation
in several operations (e.g. operations to get \"handlers\" or \"iterators\" to
Managed Objects fulfilling the scope/filter criteria and other operations to
retrieve attribute names/values from these \"handlers\").

### 7.6.2 deleteMO (O)
#### 7.6.2.1 Definition
This operation is invoked by IRPManager to request the deletion of one or more
Managed Object instances from the MIB maintained by IRPAgent. This operation
provides functionality that is similar to that provided by the M-DELETE
service defined by CMIS (ITU-T Recommendation X.710 [7]).
#### 7.6.2.2 Input Parameters
* * *
Name Qualifier Information Type Comment baseObjectInstance M DistinguishedName
The MO instance that is to be used as the starting point for the selection of
managed objects to which the filter (when supplied) is to be applied. This is
a full Distinguished Name according to 3GPP TS 32.300 [5]. scope M See
corresponding parameter in getMOAttributes. See corresponding parameter in
getMOAttributes. filter M See comment See corresponding parameter in
getMOAttributes.
* * *
#### 7.6.2.3 Output Parameters
* * *
Name Qualifier Matching Information Comment deletionList M LIST OF SEQUENCE\ If the base object
alone is specified, then this parameter is optional; otherwise it contains a
list of managedObjectInstance/managedObjectClass pairs identifying the managed
objects deleted. status M ENUM (OperationSucceeded, OperationFailed,
OperationPartiallySucceeded) An operation may fail because of a specified or
unspecified reason. The operation is partially successful if some, but not
all, objects selected to be deleted are actually deleted.
* * *
In lieu of a synchronization parameter, best effort synchronization will
apply; that is, all managed objects selected for this operation will perform
the operation if possible regardless of whether some managed objects fail to
perform it.
#### 7.6.2.4 Pre-condition
baseObjectExists AND allChildrenOfObjectsToBeDeletedSpecifiedForDeletion
* * *
Assertion Name Definition baseObjectExists The ManagedEntity instance
specified by the baseObjectInstance parameter exists.
allChildrenOfObjectsToBeDeletedSpecifiedForDeletion For any ManagedEntity
instance specified for deletion, all of its dependant ManagedEntity instances
must be specified for deletion.
* * *
#### 7.6.2.5 Post-condition
(selectedObjectsDeleted OR someSelectedObjectsDeleted) AND
objectDeletionNotificationEmitted
* * *
Assertion Name Definition selectedObjectsDeleted All of the ManagedEntity
instances selected for deletion are deleted. someSelectedObjectsDeleted Some
but not all of the selected ManagedEntity instances were deleted and for any
of the ManagedEntity instances deleted all of the child ManagedEntity
instances of that ManagedEntity instance is deleted.
objectDeletionNotificationEmitted An object deletion notification (as defined
in TS 32.662 [11]) is emitted for each notifiable deleted object. Notifiable
here means that the notification is supported and not suppressed. \"Emitted\"
here corresponds to the association stereotyped as \> in 3GPP TS
32.662 [11]. An object deletion notification of a managed object containing a
sub-tree implies deletion of all managed objects in the sub-tree. IRPAgent
should make the best effort to reduce the number of object deletion
notifications, for example by sending only one notification for the sub-tree
root object in the event of a successful deletion of an entire sub-tree.

### 7.6.3 setMOAttributes (O)
#### 7.6.3.1 Definition
This operation is invoked by IRPManager to request the modification of
management information (Managed Object attribute values) in the MIB maintained
by IRPAgent. Attributes of one or several Managed Objects may be modified -
based on the containment hierarchy. This operation provides functionality that
is similar to that provided by the M-SET service defined by CMIS (ITU-T
Recommendation X.710 [7]).

Name Qualifier Matching Information Comment modificationListOut M LIST OF
SEQUENCE\> This parameter will provide for each managed
object instance the full Distinguished Name of the managed object instance,
the managedObjectClass, and a list of name/value pairs with the values of all
the attributes of the modified managed object instance after modification. The
form of this information is solution set dependant and may be provided in one
or many data structures. status M ENUM (OperationSucceeded, OperationFailed,
OperationPartiallySucceeded) An operation may fail because of a specified or
unspecified reason and no attributes have been updated. The operation is only
successful if all specified attributes of all selected objects are actually
modified. Otherwise, the operation is partially successful.
* * *
In lieu of a synchronization parameter, best effort synchronization will
apply; that is, all managed objects selected for this operation will perform
the operation if possible regardless of whether some managed objects fail to
perform it.
