Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Integration Reference Point (IRP):** see 3GPP TS 32.150 [12].
**Managed Object (MO):** an abstract entity, which may be accessed through an
open interface between two or more systems, and representing a Network
Resource (NR) for the purpose of management. The Managed Object (MO) is an
instance of a Managed Object Class (MOC) as defined in a Management
Information Model (MIM). The MIM does not define how the MO or NR is
implemented; only what can be seen in the interface.
**Managed Object Class (MOC):** a description of all the common
characteristics for a number of MOs, such as their attributes, operations,
notifications and behaviour.
**Management Information Model (MIM)** : also referred to as NRM - see the
definition below. There is a slight difference between the meaning of MIM and
NRM - the term MIM is generic and can be used to denote any type of management
model, while NRM denotes the model of the actual managed telecommunications
Network Resources (NRs).
**Network Element (NE):** is a discrete telecommunications entity, which can
be, managed over a specific interface e.g. the RNC.
**Network Resource (NR):** is a component of a NE, which can be identified as
a discrete separate entity and is in an object oriented environment for the
purpose of management represented by an abstract entity called Managed Object
(MO).
**Network Resource Model (NRM)** : a model representing the actual managed
telecommunications Network Resources (NRs) that a System is providing through
the subject IRP. An NRM describes Managed Object Classes (MOC), their
associations, attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as
\"MIM\" (see above) which originates from the ITU-T TMN.
**Operations System (OS):** indicates a generic management system, independent
of its location level within the management hierarchy.
**Termination Point:** see ITU-T M.3100 [6].

# 4 Requirements
The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present IRP:
a) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
b) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
c) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 [3].
In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements apply.
## 4.1 MTP3 Configuration Management
a) It shall be possible for IRPManager to retrieve configuration information
related to MTP3 signalling managed entity.
b) When the configuration information of MTP3 signalling managed entities
changes, corresponding notifications shall be generated to IRPManager.
c) When the status of MTP3 signalling managed entities changes, corresponding
notifications shall be generated to IRPManager.
d) It shall be possible for IRPManager to identify which technology that the
STN is based on (e. g. MTP3, MTP3B [4]);
e) The interface shall allow for the viewing of parameters of the MTP3
signalling point, MTP3 signalling link set termination point, MTP3 signalling
link termination point, MTP3 signalling route and MTP3 signalling route set
[4], [5], [7], [8].
## 4.2 M3UA Configuration Management
a) It shall possible for IRPManager to retrieve configuration information
related to M3UA signalling managed entities.
b) When the configuration information of M3UA signalling managed entities
changes, corresponding notifications shall be generated to IRPManager.
c) When the status of M3UA signalling managed entities changes, corresponding
notifications shall be generated to IRPManager.
d) The interface shall allow for the viewing of parameters of the M3UA
signalling point, M3UA signalling link set termination point, M3UA signalling

([4], [11]).
## 4.3 Fault Management
Any fault detected by the signalling managed entity (including signalling
point, signalling link set termination point, signalling link termination
point, signalling route and signalling route set [4], [5], [7], [8]) shall be
passed up to the IRPManager.
## 4.4 Performance Management
It shall be possible for IRPManager to collect and monitor performance data.

# 5 Issues
The NRM shall allow to be extended to support other technologies based
Signalling Transport Network in the future (e.g. IP-based; see 3GPP TS 29.202
[4]).
