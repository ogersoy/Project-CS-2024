The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor LTE SAE-system.
During the lifetime of a LTE SAE network, its logical and physical
configuration will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order
to optimise the utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be
executed through network configuration management activities and/or network
engineering, see TS 32.600 [2].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a LTE SAE network require data on which to base decisions. This
data refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service
offered. In order to produce this data performance measurements are executed
in the NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an
external system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for
further evaluation. The purpose of the present document is to describe the
mechanisms involved in the collection of the data and the definition of the
data itself.
Annex B of TS 32.404 helps in the definition of new performance measurements
that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and inclusion in the
present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 discusses a top-down performance
measurement definition methodology that focuses on how the end-user of
performance measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for EPC and combined
EPC/UMTS/GSM.\ TS 32.401 [1] describes Performance Management concepts and
requirements.\ The present document is valid for all measurement types
provided by an implementation of an EPC network and combined EPC/UMTS/GSM
network. Only measurement types that are specific to EPC or combined
EPC/UMTS/GSM networks are defined within the present documents.
Vendor specific measurement types used in EPC and combined EPC/UMTS/GSM
networks are not covered. Instead, these could be applied according to
manufacturer\'s documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as IP) as described by
\"external\" standards bodies (e.g. IETF) shall only be referenced within this
specification, wherever there is a need identified for the existence of such a
reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. MME related measurements);
\- Header 2: Measurement function;
\- Header 3: Measurements.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Use case for measurements
# A.1 Use case for mobility management related measurements
A UE/user needs to register with the network to receive services that require
registration. This registration is described as Network Attachment. The
always-on IP connectivity for UE/users of the EPS is enabled by establishing a
default EPS bearer during Network Attachment. The PCC rules applied to the
default EPS bearer may be predefined in the PDN GW and activated in the
attachment by the PDN GW itself. The Attach procedure may trigger one or
multiple Dedicated Bearer Establishment procedures to establish dedicated EPS
bearer(s) for that UE. During the attach procedure, the UE may request for an
IP address allocation. Terminals utilising only IETF based mechanisms for IP
address allocation are also supported.
If user or subscriber cannot attach to the PS network of EPC, they cannot
access network, so they may complain about quality of service provided by EPC
network. So it is necessary to define attach related measurements to evaluate
network attchment performance of EPC network by attchment success rate.
# A.2 Use case for detach related measurements
The detach procedure is used by the UE to detach only for EPS services or to
detach for both EPS services and non-EPS services or only for non-EPS services
via a combined detach procedure. Also the detach procedure can be used by the
network to inform the UE that it does not have access to the EPS any longer.
Three detach procedures are provided when the UE accesses the EPS through
E-UTRAN. The first detach procedure is UE-initiated detach procedure and other
detach procedures are network-initiated detach procedures, which are MME-
initiated detach procedure and HSS-initiated detach procedure respectively.
The detach procedure shall be invoked by the UE if the UE is switched off, the
USIM card is removed from the UE or the EPS capability or CS fallback
capability of the UE is disabled. The detach procedure shall be invoked by the
network if the UE is illegal or GPRS services are not allowed in this PLMN and
etc. The UE is detached either explicitly or implicitly. Explicit detach means
that the network or the UE explicitly requests detach and signal with each
other; implicit detach means that the network detaches the UE without
notifying the UE, which is typically the case when the network presumes that
it is not able to communicate with the UE, e.g. due to radio conditions.
If the detach procedure is performed, the EPS bearer context(s) for this
particular UE are deactivated locally without peer-to-peer signalling between
the UE and the MME.
Due to different EMM causes, the detach procedures are invoked by the UE or
the network. In order to estimate the relative performance of detach of EPC
network, it is necessary to define detach related measurements by detach
success rate.
# A.3 Use case for tracking area update related measurements
If a user fails upating the Tracking Area, it may not be able to attach to the
new Tracking Area, and then the user experience would be very intolerable.
Since MME determines to relocate S-GW based on S-GW service area, which is
composed of TAs, it is assumed that S-GW service area is already known in
MMEs. If the MME identifies that the new TA is out of the scope of S-GW
service area, it shall perform inter S-GW Tracking Area Update procedure,
otherwise, it shall perform intra S-GW Tracking Area Update procedure.
Thus it is necessary to define Tracking Area Update related measurements
includes both Inter and Intra S-GW Tracking Area Update procedures to evaluate
network tracking area update performance of EPC network by calculate success
rate.
# A.4 Use case for session related measurements
The purpose of the dedicated bearer context activation procedure is to
establish an EPS bearer context with specific QoS and TFT (Traffic Flow
Template) between the UE and the EPC. The dedicated EPS bearer context
activation procedure is initiated by the network, but may be requested by the
UE by means of the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure. The
dedicated bearer context activation procedure can be part of the attach
procedure, and if the attach procedure fails, the UE shall consider that the
dedicated bearer activation has implicitly failed.
The purpose of the EPS bearer context modification procedure is to modify an
EPS bearer context with a specific QoS and TFT. The EPS bearer context
modification procedure is initiated by the network in order to either modify
the QoS, the TFT, or both. The EPS bearer context modification procedure is
initiated by the network, but it may be initiated as part of the UE requested
bearer resource allocation procedure.
The purpose of the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is to deactivate
an EPS bearer context or disconnect from a PDN by deactivating all EPS bearer
contexts to the PDN. The EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is
initiated by the network, and it may be triggered by the UE by means of the UE
requested bearer resource release procedure or UE requested PDN disconnect
procedure.
If users or subscribers cannot use the services provided by EPS successfully,
the users' subjective feel to the network is influenced. So it is necessary to
define session related measurements to evaluate session performance of EPC
network.
# A.5 Use case for EPS paging procedures
Paging success rate is one of the important performance indicators for network
performance analysis. It measures the paging response acceptance rate when the
CN believes that the mobile is in the coverage area and pages the mobile to
find the terminating mobile party to complete the incoming call. If the paging
success rate is too low, network access success rate will be impacted. Paging
success rate is calculated by paging related measurements. So it is necessary
to define paging related measurements.
# A.6 Use case of PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer Management related
measurements for EPC
As PDN-GW is the element that initiate the dedicated bearer, if PDN-GW can not
activate the dedicated bearer, then users or subscribers cannot use the
services provided by EPS successfully, which will influence the users'
subjective feel to the network. So it is necessary to define PDN-GW initiated
Dedicated Bearer Creation related measurements to evaluate session performance
of EPC network.
# A.7 Use case of PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer Management related
measurements for EPC
The PDN-GW shall be able to delete the dedicated bearer to release more
network resources. If the PDN-GW can not delete the dedicated bearer, then the
valid network resource for user will become less and less which may leads to
system crash. So it is necessary to define PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer
Deletion related measurements to evaluate session performance of EPC network.
# A.8 Use case of PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer Management related
measurements for EPC
The PDN-GW shall be able to update the dedicated bearer to modify an EPS
bearer with a specific QoS and TFT, if PDN-GW can not update QoS and TFT, then
users or subscribers cannot achieve better network resource and the PDN-GW
cannot map the service flow to the appropriate bearer, which will influence
the users' subjective feel to the network. So it is necessary to define PDN-GW
initiated Dedicated Bearer Modification with QoS Update related measurements
to evaluate session performance of EPC network.
# A.9 Use case of PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer Management related
measurements for EPC
The PDN-GW shall be able to update the dedicated bearer to modify an EPS
bearer with a specific TFT, if PDN-GW can not update TFT, then the PDN-GW
cannot map the service flow to the appropriate bearer, which will influence
the users' subjective feel to the network. So it is necessary to define PDN-GW
initiated Dedicated Bearer Modification without QoS Update related
measurements to evaluate session performance of EPC network.
