# Introduction
This Technical Report documents functionality being specified to support IMS
Emergency Calls over GPRS and EPS. Because IMS emergency call support is
expected to impact several functional areas, this TR will describe the
functionality as it is being developed. Once a functional component is
complete the appropriate Technical Specifications will be updated accordingly.
# 1 Scope
## 1.1 Objective
This TR has been created for the purpose of having a single source for
documenting the GPRS and EPS enhancements to support emergency calls. As
solutions to particular aspects are agreed, CRs will be created for the
associated TSs. This TR is not a study. The IMS Emergency Services study is
available in TR 23.867 [5].
The present document includes the following:
  * Functionality needed to meet the requirements as defined in TS > 22.101 and 23.167for handling IMS emergency calls over the GPRS > using GERAN and UTRAN access both in the case where the UE is in > normal service mode (e.g., UE has sufficient credentials and is > authorized to receive the service) and where the UE is in limited > service mode (e.g. the UE does not have sufficient credentials or > is not authorized to receive GPRS service).
  * Functionality needed to meet the requirements as defined in TS > 22.101 and 23.167 for handling IMS emergency calls over the EPS > using E-UTRAN access both in the case where the UE is in normal > service mode (e.g., UE has sufficient credentials and is > authorized to receive the service) and where the UE is in limited > service mode (e.g. the UE does not have sufficient credentials or > is not authorized to receive EPS service).
  * EPS functionality needed to support IMS emergency call handovers > between 3GPP accesses and between 3GPP and non-3GPP access.
  * Note: Access network specific impacts for a UE to attach to the > non-3GPP access network for emergency calling are out of scope of > 3GPP.
  * EPS functionality to support of IMS emergency calls that complies > with applicable requirements for provision of location information > as defined in TS 23.167.
# 2 Background
GPRS Emergency Services procedures were partially complete in Release 7. A
decision was made at SA#36 to remove GPRS Emergency Services support from
Release 7 so that a complete solution could be developed in Release 8 (see
section 9.17 of the SA#36 meeting report [4]). The functionality provided
support for valid subscribers initiating an IMS Emergency Call over UTRAN
while in their home network or while roaming. The GPRS enhancements included:
a) Definition of an Emergency APN: A UE that needs to do IMS emergency >
registration (for example always in VPLMN) shall start by > requesting a PDP
context with the emergency APN in GPRS. The > emergency APN is the basic part
of the Rel-7 solution, because it > enables IMS emergency services with local
break-out for roaming > UEs in VPLMN. In a home network, a PDP context to an
emergency APN > also provides a way for GPRS to identify a session for
emergency > services so that special GPRS handling, that may override >
subscription, can be allowed.(e.g., QoS and ARP). This capability > is
critical for the most basic solution that could be supported > and should be
the highest priority functionality to be specified.
b) UE QoS indication of emergency: The UE shall include an emergency >
indication in the UMTS bearer QoS IE when establishing or > modifying the PDP
context used for the emergency service. It has > been determined that this is
not needed. QoS can be provided by > either establishment of the emergency PDP
context or through PCC.
c) Qos Negotiation: SGSN handling of the ARP is modified to not > re-verify
the value received from the GGSN against the > subscription. This allows the
GGSN to change the ARP for emergency > services to a high priority so the call
will not be pre-empted. > This is functionality is important for overriding
subscription in > order to override ARP subscription limits.
d) Network support indication: The SGSN shall indicate in the Attach > Accept
and RAU Accept messages whether GPRS emergency functions > are supported in
the network. This indicator improves functional > efficiency.

# 5 Overall Functionality to Support IMS Emergency Calls
Editor's Note: This section will expand upon the objectives listed in clause
1.
## 5.1 IMS Functionality
### 5.1.1 Release 7 functionality to be considered for Release 8
As documented in section 9.17 of the SA#37 meeting report [8], GPRS
functionality removed from Release 7 can be reinserted with Release 8 CRs. The
table in Annex A lists the CRs handled during SA#36, #37 and #38 regarding
GPRS support of IMS emergency calls. The CRs in the table marked as "open"
indicates they need to be considered in Release 8.
1) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) emergency sessions; TS 23.167 [4]: > For the
most part the IMS specification is access network > agnostic. However
references and examples referring to GPRS were > removed from the TS and these
need to be added back. If only valid > subscribers are addressed initially,
then GPRS would be added to > the applicable sections and another CR would be
needed later to > add GPRS to the sections addressing limited mode. Refer to
SA#37 > CR0069R3.
### 5.1.2 Release 8 Functionality
1) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) emergency sessions; TS 23.167 [4]:
  * The E-UTRAN specification TS 23.401 [14] needs to be added to the > references section and referenced throughout the document where > appropriate where other IP-CAN specifications are referenced.
  * Annex E "Emergency support in different IP-CANs" needs to have GPRS > updated.
Editor's note: the term "IP-CAN" is FFS for 23.203.
### 5.2 GPRS Functionality
### 5.2.1 UTRAN Functionality overview
The minimum UTRAN functionality needed to support IMS emergency calling for
UEs in normal service mode, while in their home network or while roaming, is
the ability to establish an emergency PDP context (i.e., the emergency APN).
This allows QoS and ARP rules to be established for sessions associated with
the emergency PDP context to meet local regulatory requirements. An emergency
PDP context also allows the knowledge of the emergency session to be supported
during handovers that cause a new SGSN to be assigned because the emergency
PDP context is included in the mobility messages (Forward Relocation Request
and Routing Area Update). The QoS negotiation capability and network
indication of emergency support are also efficient handling of emergency
calls.
### 5.2.2 UTRAN Normal Service Mode Functionality
TR 23.867 [5] is the study for IMS emergency calls and associated IP-CAN
impacts.
IP-CAN requirements to support IMS emergency calls are specified in section
4.4 of TS 23.167 [3]. Additionally, TS 23.167 v7.4.0 Annex A contains further
analysis of GPRS impacts related to the IP-CAN requirements.
A synopsis of UTRAN functionality needed to support IMS emergency calls for
UEs operating in normal service mode is provided in Annex B.
#### 5.2.2.1 Release 7 functionality to be considered for Release 8
The table in Annex A lists the CRs handled during SA#36, #37 and #38 regarding
GPRS support of IMS emergency calls. The CRs in the table marked as "open"
indicates the functionality needs to be considered for Release 8. Note: QoS
may be changing in Release 8 and also needs to be considered.

#### 5.2.2.2 Key Issue 1: PCC rule for Allocation and Retention Priority
##### 5.2.2.2.1 Description
Based on SA2#59 S2-073681, an Emergency ARP parameter in the PCC based rules
is considered to allow PCC to override the subscription ARP. This allows PCC
to assign an ARP value to a session that may not be allowed per subscription.
This allows PCC to assign a higher priority to emergency sessions.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Solution
Policy and charging control architecture; TS 23.203 [13]: needs to consider
defining a PCC based rule for Allocation and Retention Priority parameter for
emergency sessions.

## 5.3 EPS Functionality
### 5.3.1 EPS Functionality overview
The solution for the EPS is aimed at supporting both normal mode and limited
service mode. When the UE is in normal service mode the normal EMM procedures
apply. As the UE enters limited service mode as specified in TS 23.122 [15]
(e.g., Attach request is rejected), special EMM procedures for emergency
service may be needed to access EPS. For release 8, the proposed solution uses
the emergency APN. In all cases (e.g., home, roaming, normal mode, limited
service mode), emergency connectivity to an emergency APN will be used. The UE
initiates the emergency connectivity upon recognition of dialled emergency
number. This connectivity is limited to using emergency services available at
the PDN served by the emergency APN, via static rules (thus no impact on PCC).
The ARP values set for the bearer used to provide connectivity to the
Emergency APN shall be adequate to support emergency services (this is to be
decided when the ARP definition is complete) and the QCI shall select a GBR
service for conversational voice service. And the GBR set to the value
necessary to support the selected codec for the emergency service.
### 5.3.2 E-UTRAN Normal Service Mode Functionality
A synopsis of E-UTRAN functionality needed to support IMS emergency calls for
UEs operating in normal service mode is provided in Annex B.
#### 5.3.2.1 Key Issue 1: Attach: shall it be a normal attach or an emergency
attach?
##### 5.3.2.1.1 Description
>It has to be decided whether a UE that will start an emergency session and
has not yet made an initial attach to the network needs to perform a normal
attach or an emergency attach. 5.3.2.1.2 Solution
The emergency attach procedure should not be attempted until:
  * the UE is in limited service mode and
  * the UE is attempting to set up an emergency session
When a normal attach is used, a default bearer is set up based on subscription
or operator policy. The APN associated to this default bearer is normally not
supporting the features associates to an emergency access. So, subsequent to a
normal attach, another (additional) default bearer to the emergency APN to be
set up. This PDN connection shall have the QoS attributes suitable to support
an emergency call.
The handling of the limited service state attach for the E-UTRAN is described
in the relevant section in this TR.
#### 5.3.2.2 Key Issue 2:
##### 5.3.2.2.1 Description
\
##### 5.3.2.2.2 Solution
\
\
### 5.3.3 E-UTRAN Limited Service Mode Functionality
#### 5.3.2.1 Key Issue 1: Attach in limited service state
##### 5.3.2.1.1 Description
If the attach procedure or the tracking area update procedures fail the UE
enters a limited service mode allowing the UE to place only emergency calls --
if the network allows for that - until another non blacklisted TAI is
identified on the broadcast information, in which case a normal attach will be
attempted. Before a UE can place an emergency call, it needs to be attached to
the network
##### 5.3.2.1.2 Solution
If the user attempts to place an emergency call while in limited service mode,
then an emergency attach is attempted with the IMSI or IMEI as a UE
identifier. IMEI is included if the UE does not have a UICC. The IMEI is
included to potentially blacklist malicious callers. The emergency attach will
not directly cause a TAU to be performed and will override any service
restriction that would otherwise forbid the UE from being attached in the
specific TA.
The emergency attach procedure also causesd the establishment of a default EPS
bearer providing PDN connectivity to the emergency APN. This PDN connection
shall have the QoS attributes suitable to support an emergency call. Over this
connectivity it is possible to establish an IMS session for emergency services
only, and static rules will prevent the usage of this APN for other purposes.
##### 5.3.2.2 Key Issue 2: Mobility management during an emergency call
##### 5.3.2.2.1 Description
An ongoing successful emergency call placed while the UE is in normal or
limited service state may be interrupted by a failed TA update or any other
service restriction implying the UE should be detached. A mechanism is needed
to avoid this.
##### 5.3.2.2.2 Solution -- special handling of TA updates for emergency
services
Provide explicit context in the EPC so that the network is aware an emergency
call is ongoing . This will avoid TA UPDATE failures (the TA updates always
succeed during an emergency call).

      **Use Case**                                                  **Solution**
6 UTRAN based IMS capable UE that has no roaming restrictions Only intra-PLMN
handovers are considered in Rel.8. A UE in normal mode is allowed to perform
handovers and are not restricted from entering a new area so no enhancements

## B.1.2 GPRS Non-Emergency Procedures to Support Emergency Sessions
The following are based on CRs that were agreed in rel.7 for GPRS emergency
call support and need to be reconsidered for rel.8:
### B.1.2.1 Network Indicator
To inform the UE whether or not the network supports the Emergency APN, the
SGSN will always include the "Emergency Support Indication" in the response to
the UE on Attach and Routing Update (Attach Accept, Routing Update Accept,
Attach Reject, Routing Update Reject).
## B.2. IMS Emergency Calls over E-UTRAN
## B.2.1 E-UTRAN Use Cases

      **Use Case**                                                 **Solution**
6 E-UTRAN based IMS capable UE with no roaming restrictions. Only intra-PLMN
handovers are considered in Rel.8. A UE in normal mode is allowed to perform
handovers and are not restricted from entering a new area so no enhancements
are needed.

## B.2.2 EPS Non-Emergency Procedures to Support Emergency Sessions
The following are based on CRs that were agreed in rel.7 for GPRS emergency
call support and need to be considered for EPS:
### B.2.2.2 Network Indicator
To inform the UE whether or not the network supports the Emergency APN, the
MME will always include the "Emergency Support Indication" in the response to
the UE on Attach and Tracking Area Update (Attach Accept, Tracking Area Update
Accept, Attach Reject, Tracking Area Update Reject).
