##### 3.1 Definitions {#definitions .H6}
Add the following definition:
**Network Address Translation (NA(P)T):** method by which IP addresses are
mapped from one group to another, transparently to end users. Network Address
Port Translation, or NA(P)T is a method by which many network addresses and
their TCP/UDP (Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol) ports are
translated into a single network address and its TCP/UDP ports. See RFC 3022
[96] for further details.
Replace the definition of \"ALG\" as follows:
**Application Level Gateway (ALG):** application specific functional entity
that allows communication between disparate address realm or IP versions when
certain applications carry network addresses in the payloads like SIP/SDP.
NA(P)T-PT or NA(P)T is application unaware whereas ALGs are application
specific translation entities that allow a host running an application to
communicate transparently with another host running the same application but
in a different IP version or IP address realm.
For IMS, an **IMS ALG** provides the necessary application function for
SIP/SDP protocols in order to communicate between different address realms or
IP versions.

while the terminal moves[, ~~and~~]{.underline} hide~~s~~ these moves from the
IP multimedia subsystem.
##### 4.2.1.1 Support for CAMEL {#support-for-camel .H6}
Modify the title and the text as follows:
\- replace \"CAMEL\" with \"CAMEL or IN\"
\- replace \"CSE\" with \"CSE or IN Service Environment\"
##### 4.6.1 Proxy-CSCF {#proxy-cscf .H6}
Add the following above the paragraph starting "The functions peformed by the
P-CSCF"
[The Service Policy Decision Function (SPDF) may be a logical entity of the
P-CSCF or a separate physical node. If the SPDF is implemented in a separate
physical node, the interface between the SPDF and the P-CSCF is the Gq\'
interface standardised in TS 183 017 [98].]{.underline}

23.203 [54] and [ES 282 003 [97]]{.underline}.
NOTE: TS 23.203 [54] is not applicable when RACS is used.
Add the following clause.
## 4.18 Support of Number portability
NOTE: The text of clause 4.18. is except for this note identical to the text
of clause 4.18 of TS 23.228 version 8.2.0
### 4.18.1 Number portability
Number portability (NP) allows a user to retain their E.164 number when
changing subscriptions from one network operator to another. As such, NP
applies to TEL URIs and SIP URI with user=phone parameters. NP is subject to
regional requirements and is accomplished through the retrieval of ported data
from those data bases. The specification of these data bases is out of scope
of this document, but the NP data may be accessed through ENUM/DNS or accessed
via existing (PSTNâ€‘ and CSâ€‘domain) NP databases using the legacy PSTN/CS-
domain protocols, such as TCAP.
Support of NP within a network and the exact means to make the number
portability data available to IMS, is subject to and configured per operator
policy. NP is not mandated by this specification on any network operator.
As configured per operator policy, IMS ENUM interfaces can be updated to
support handling of the PSTN ENUM service per RFC 4769 [57], which provides a
URI containing an E.164 number with NP routing information and NP dip
indicators. The IMS entity receiving NP information as a result of an ENUM/DNS
query, the Sâ€‘CSCF as an example, needs to support, or not remove, NP protocol
parameters retrieved as part of ENUM/DNS procedures contained in this
specification. Subsequent network elements used to process the call to the
PSTN do not remove the NP protocol parameters inserted in SIP messaging as
part of the NP data retrieval procedure.
NP data can also be made available by means of direct access to PSTN/CSâ€‘domain
NP Databases using the legacy PSTN/CS-Domain interfaces and protocols. To
support this existing interface within the network, the requesting and
subsequent network elements need to support, or not remove, NP protocol
parameters within SIP messages that result from the NP data retrieval
procedures. The procedures to retrieve the NP data using the legacy
PSTN/CSâ€‘domain interfaces are out of scope of this specification.
Alternatively, per operator policy, the BGCF can retrieve NP data as part of
the procedures to select an MGCF for PSTN connection. The interface used at
the BGCF to retrieve the NP data is out of scope of this specification.
Alternatively, per operator policy, the MGCF may support legacy interfaces to
retrieve number portability data.
NOTE: Although legacy protocols are used to access the number portability
database, this does not imply that the IMS nodes (CSCFs, BGCFs) need to
implement such protocols.
##### 5.0 General {#general-1 .H6}
Modify the text as follows:
This section documents the main procedures that are used for the provision of
services in the IP multimedia subsystem. These procedures are described using
text description as well as information flow diagrams. The procedures
described in this document are meant to provide a high level description and
are not intended to be exhaustive. ~~Additional procedures and details are
provided in TS 24.228 [10]~~.
##### 5.2.2.5 Stored information {#stored-information .H6}
Modify the text as follows:
Table 5.1 provides an indication of some of the information stored in the
indicated nodes during and after the registration process. Note that Table 5.1
is not an exhaustive list of stored information, i.e. there can be additional
information stored due to registration.

##### 5.4 Procedures for IP Multi-media sessions {#procedures-for-ip-multi-
media-sessions .H6}
##### 5.4.2a IP version interworking concepts {#a-ip-version-interworking-
concepts .H6}
Modify as shown below
It should be possible for users connected to an IMS network to communicate
with users that are connected to SIP based networks that use a different IP
version via interworking [or that are in a separate addressing range (e.g.,
NA(P)T functionality is set at the border of the IMS)]{.underline}.
##### 5.4.4 Requirements for IP multi-media session control {#requirements-
for-ip-multi-media-session-control .H6}
Modify as shown below:
6\. The solution shall comply with the architectural rules relating to
separation of bearer level, session control level, and service level
~~expressed in 23.221 [7]~~.
##### 5.4.5 Session Path Information {#session-path-information .H6}
Modify the text as follows:
##### 5.4.5.1 Session Path Information during Registration and Session
Initiation {#session-path-information-during-registration-and-session-
initiation .H6}
During registration and session initiation there are SIP mechanisms, which
provide the means to determine the session path.
After registration the P-CSCF stores the S-CSCF name[, possibly IBCF
names]{.underline} and the S-CSCF stores the P-CSCF name [and possibly IBCF
names]{.underline} (see 4.3.4) as part of the UE related information.
There is a need to store the session path that is determined during the
session initiation request in order to route the subsequent session requests
through this determined path. This is needed in order to route these session
requests through certain nodes, e.g. the ones performing Service Control[, or
interconnect functions]{.underline}. CSCFs are assumed to perform certain
actions:
1\. CSCFs (Proxy and Serving) store a certain part of the session path
determined during session initiation. This allows CSCFs to generate requests
that traverse all elements on a Route path.
2\. The P-CSCF shall check correct usage of the header values. Should an UE
build inaccurate header(s) in a SIP request, the P-CSCF may reject the
request. If an operator policy requires enforcing the routes stored in P-CSCF,
the P-CSCF shall overwrite the header(s) provided by the UE with the
appropriate values.
##### 5.4.7 Interaction between QoS and session signalling {#interaction-
between-qos-and-session-signalling .H6}
**Clauses 5.4.7.0 to 5.4.7.7 are not applicable to IP-CANs using RACS.**
Add the following clause:
##### 5.4.7a Interaction between RACS and IMS {#a-interaction-between-racs-
and-ims .H6}
The P-CSCF interacts with the RACS in order to do the following:
\- Request bindings data between the different IP addresses (NA(P)T or
NA(P)T-PT) upon session initiation/modification.
\- Request media latching in hosted NAT scenarios.
\- Release the bindings at session release.
\- Open/close gates between domains (i.e. packets filtering depending on \"IP
address / port\").
\- Perform packet marking.
\- Resource allocation and bandwidth reservation for upstream and downstream
traffic.
\- Policing of incoming traffic.
More details can be found in ES 282 003 [97] and TS 183 017 [98].
##### 5.6 Origination procedures {#origination-procedures .H6}
Modify the text as follows:
##### 5.6.1 (MO#1) Mobile origination, roaming {#mo1-mobile-origination-
roaming .H6}
This clause is endorsed with the clarification that \"P-CSCF(PCRF)\" is
replaced with \"P-CSCF\".
##### 5.6.2 (MO#2) Mobile origination, home {#mo2-mobile-origination-home .H6}
This clause is endorsed with the clarification that \"P-CSCF(PCRF)\" is
replaced with \"P-CSCF\".
Insert the following clause:
##### 5.6.2a (FO#1) Fixed origination, home {#a-fo1-fixed-origination-home
.H6}
This origination procedure applies to users located in their home service
area. As in clause 5.6.2, the UE is located in the home network, but is using
an xDSL IP-CAN to access the IMS Core.
NOTE: The below flows are example flows. The detailed stage 2 description of
the RACS information flows can be found in ES 282 003 [97].
Figure 5.15a: Fixed xDSL originating -- home (example flow)
Procedure F0#1 is as follows:
1\. UE sends the SIP INVITE request, containing an initial SDP, to the P-CSCF
address determined with P-CSCF discovery mechanism. The initial SDP may
represent one or more media for a multi-media session.
2\. A connection is reserved in the C-BGF with optional NAT binding list
retrieval.
3\. P-CSCF remembers (from the registration procedure) the next hop CSCF for
this UE. In this case it forwards the INVITE to the S-CSCF in the home
network.
4\. S-CSCF validates the service profile, and invokes any origination service
logic required for this user. This includes authorisation of the requested SDP
based on the user\'s subscription for multi-media services.
5\. S-CSCF forwards the request, as specified by the S-S procedures.
6\. The media stream capabilities of the destination are returned along the
signalling path, per the S-S procedures.
7-9. S-CSCF forwards the Offer Response message to the P-CSCF which triggers
RACS. RACS performs admission control based on the Offer and Answer
parameters.\ RACS configures the connections in the C-BGF based on the SDP
answer and optionally requests a NAT binding list.
10\. UE decides the offered set of media streams for this session, confirms
receipt of the Offer Response and sends the Response Confirmation to P-CSCF.
The Response Confirmation may also contain SDP. This may be the same SDP as in
the Offer Response received in Step 9 or a subset. If new media are defined by
this SDP, a new connection configuration shall be performed following Step 2.
The originating UE is free to continue to offer new media in this request or
in subsequent requests using the Update method. Each offer/answer exchange
will cause the P-CSCF to repeat the RACS interactions again.
11\. P-CSCF forwards this message to S-CSCF
12\. S-CSCF forwards this message to the terminating endpoint, as per the S-S
procedure.
13\. The terminating end point responds to the originating end with an
acknowledgement. If Optional SDP is contained in the Response Confirmation,
the Confirmation Acknowledge will also contain an SDP response. If the SDP has
changed, the admission control and configure connection flows are repeated.
14-15. S-CSCF and P-CSCF forward the answered media towards the UE.
16-18. The destination UE may optionally perform alerting. If so, it signals
this to the originating party by a provisional response indicating Ringing.
This message is sent to S-CSCF per the S-S procedure. It is sent from there
toward the originating end along the signalling path. UE indicates to the
originating user that the destination is ringing.
19-20. When the destination party answers, the terminating endpoint sends a
SIP 200-OK final response along the signalling path to the originating
endpoint, as specified by the termination procedures and the S-S procedures.
21\. P-CSCF performs the approval of QoS Commit procedure which triggers the
Open Gates procedures if required.
22\. P-CSCF passes the 200-OK response back to UE
23\. UE starts the media flow(s) for this session.
24-26. UE responds to the 200 OK with an ACK message which is sent to P-CSCF
and passed along the signalling path to the terminating endpoint.
Insert the following clause:
##### 5.7.2b (FT#1) Fixed termination, home {#b-ft1-fixed-termination-home
.H6}
NOTE: The below flows are example flows. The detailed stage 2 description of
the RACS information flows can be found in ES 282 003 [97].
This termination procedure applies to users located in their home service
area. As in clause 5.7.2, the UE is located in the home network, but has
registered to the IMS Core via an xDSL IP-CAN.
Figure 5.18b: Fixed xDSL terminating -- home (example flow)
Procedure FT#1 is as follows:
1\. UE#1 sends the SIP INVITE request, containing an initial SDP, via one of
the origination procedures and the S-S procedures, to the Serving-CSCF for the
terminating UE.
2\. S-CSCF validates the service profile, and invokes any termination service
logic required. This includes authorisation of the requested SDP based on the
user\'s subscription for multi-media services.
3\. S-CSCF remembers (from the registration procedure) the P-CSCF address for
this UE. The S-CSCF forwards the INVITE to the P-CSCF, which in this case is
located in the home network.
4\. The P-CSCF triggers RACS which reserves a connection in C-BGF with
optional NAT binding retrieval.
5\. P-CSCF remembers (from the registration procedure) the UE address, and
forwards the INVITE to the UE.
6\. UE determines the subset of the media flows proposed by the originating
endpoint that it is capable and willing to support, and responds with an Offer
Response message back to the originator. The SDP may represent one or more
media for a multi-media session. This response is sent to the P-CSCF.
7\. P-CSCF triggers RACS to perform admission control based on Offer and
Answer parameters.\ RACS configures the connection in the C-BGF based on SDP
answer with optional NAT binding retrieval.
8\. P-CSCF forwards the Offer Response message to S-CSCF.
9\. S-CSCF forwards the Offer Response message to the originator, per the S-S
procedure.
10-15. The originating endpoint sends a Response Confirmation via the S-S
procedure, to the terminating S-CSCF. The Response Confirmation may also
contain SDP. This may be the same SDP as in the Offer Response sent in Step 19
or a subset. If new media are defined by this SDP, a new interaction with the
RACS (as in Step 4-8) will be done by the P-CSCF. The originating UE is free
to continue to offer new media in this request or in a subsequent request
using the Update method. Each offer/answer exchange will cause the P-CSCF to
repeat the RACS interactions (Step 4-8) again.
16-18. UE may alert the user and wait for an indication from the user before
completing the session. If so, it indicates this to the originating party by a
provisional response indicating Ringing. This message is sent to\ P-CSCF and
along the signalling path to the originating endpoint.
19\. When the destination party answers, UE sends a SIP 200-OK final response
to P-CSCF.
20\. P-CSCF indicates that the resources reserved for this session should now
be committed.
21-22. P-CSCF forwards the 200-OK to S-CSCF, following the signalling path.
23-25. The session originator responds to the 200-OK by sending the ACK
message to S-CSCF via the S-S procedure and it is forwarded to the terminating
end along the signalling path.

Modify as follows:
##### G.2 Reference model {#g.2-reference-model .H6}
The requirements in this clause do not apply when RACS is used.
Add the following clause:
##### G.2A Reference model with RACS {#g.2a-reference-model-with-racs .H6}
Figure G.1a presents the general reference model for IMS access when both the
signalling and media traverses NAT devices. Figure G.2a presents the general
reference model when IP address translation is needed between the IP-CAN and
the IMS domain. The IMS network architecture is the same for both cases.
NOTE: The P-CSCF and the C-BGF may belong to different operators.

##### G.3 Network elements for employing the IMS-ALG and IMS Access Gateway
{#g.3-network-elements-for-employing-the-ims-alg-and-ims-access-gateway .H6}
##### G.3.1 Required functions of the P-CSCF {#g.3.1-required-functions-of-
the-p-cscf .H6}
The requirements in this clause do not apply when RACS is used.
Add the following clause:
##### G.3.1A Required functions of the P-CSCF with RACS {#g.3.1a-required-
functions-of-the-p-cscf-with-racs .H6}
For performing communication with UEs when IP address translation is needed
between the IP-CAN and the IMS domain on the media path only (Figure G.2a) or
on both the media and signalling (Figure G.1a), the P-CSCF shall perform the
following functions:
\- Act as an IMS-ALG by changing the appropriate SIP/SDP parameters in order
to translate addresses into same or different IP version addresses, in case
NA(P)T or NA(P)T-(PT) is required between the IP-CAN domain and the IM
Subsystem core network elements.
\- Request the RACS to provide the IP address bindings data upon session
initiation, to modify those bindings any time during the session, and to
release the bindings at session release.
Additionally in support of the hosted NAT scenarios (see Figure G.1), the
P-CSCF shall request the RACS to initiate media latching, in order to retrieve
the remote address information of the media received from, and sent to, a NAT
device between the P-CSCF and the served UE.
##### G.3.2 Required functions of the IMS Access Gateway {#g.3.2-required-
functions-of-the-ims-access-gateway .H6}
The requirements in this clause do not apply when RACS is used.
##### G.3.3 Iq reference point {#g.3.3-iq-reference-point .H6}
The requirements in this clause do not apply when RACS is used.
Add the following clause:
##### G.4.2a NAT traversal for signalling {#g.4.2a-nat-traversal-for-
signalling .H6}
To keep the NAT binding and firewall pinholes open for signalling traffic, one
of the following methods shall apply:
  * A registration timer shall be provisioned in the P-CSCF for the TEs behind a NAT or firewall. To minimize the number of SIP Register messages between the P-CSCF and the S-CSCF, the P-CSCF may forward the minimum number of SIP Register messages required by the S-CSCF registration timer. This method is controlled by the P-CSCF, and has the benefit to be transparent to the TE
  * An Outbound [48] keep alive for NAT binding may be sent by the TE to the SIP port of the P-CSCF using the same transport address information (source and destination) which was used for the registration request. This method is controlled by the TE. It may be complementary to the first one in case the P-CSCF does not provision the appropriate registration timer for the TE.
##### G.4.3 Session establishment procedure {#g.4.3-session-establishment-
procedure .H6}

The requirements in this clause do not apply when RACS is used.
##### Annex I (normative): Border Control Functions {#annex-i-normative-
border-control-functions .H6}
Modify as follows:
Replace clause I.2 by the following:
##### I.2 Overall architecture {#i.2-overall-architecture .H6}
Figure I.2.1 presents a high-level architecture diagram showing how Border
Control Functions fit into the IMS architecture.
Figure I.1: Border Control Functions
The Mx reference point allows Sâ€‘CSCF/Iâ€‘CSCF/P-CSCF to communicate with an IBCF
in order to provide border control functions.
##### I.3.1.1 Originating Session Flows towards IPv4 SIP network
{#i.3.1.1-originating-session-flows-towards-ipv4-sip-network .H6}
This clause is endorsed with the clarification that the TrGW is replaced by
the I-BGF when the RACS is used.
##### I.3.1.2 Terminating Session Flows from IPv4 SIP network
{#i.3.1.2-terminating-session-flows-from-ipv4-sip-network .H6}
This clause is endorsed with the clarification that the TrGW is replaced by

Add the following clause:
##### I.3.2A Additional IBCF screening functions {#i.3.2a-additional-ibcf-
screening-functions .H6}
The IBCF can filter all SIP signalling information based on source/destination
and operator policy (e.g. remove information that is of local significance to
an operator).
Add the following clause:
##### I.3.2B Addition of the IWF {#i.3.2b-addition-of-the-iwf .H6}
The IBCF can detect whether an IWF needs to be added in the SIP signalling
path. The IBCF can insert the IWF in the signalling route when appropriate.
Add the following annex:
###### ## Annex ZA (normative): IP version considerations
The present document does not place any requirement with regards to the IP
version to be supported by UEs for accessing the IMS Core. More specifically
the following scenarios are supported:
\- IP version 4 only UEs accessing the IMS Core.
\- IP version 6 only UEs accessing the IMS Core.
\- Dual stack UEs accessing the IMS Core.
The IP version used by IMS Core entities (e.g. CSCFs) to exchange SIP
signalling depends on the IP version used by [ ]{.underline} the terminals
that a given operator is willing to support. A number of scenarios are hence
possible.
NOTE: An analysis of the requirements deriving for each of those scenarios in
a GPRS environment can be found in 3GPP TR 23.981 [99].
###### ## [Annex ZB (normative): Interaction with the RACS]{.underline}
## [ZB.1 IBCF interaction with the RACS]{.underline}
[The IBCF may interact with the RACS in order to do the
following:]{.underline}
[- Provide the RACS with information on the \"resource reservation service
class\" required for a particular session; the \"resource reservation service
class\" enables the RACS to derive transport layer characteristics required
for a session (e.g. decision to include an I-BGF for the session, or media
interconnect link selection...).]{.underline}
[- Request bindings data between the different IP addresses (NA(P)T or
NA(P)T-PT) upon session initiation/modification.]{.underline}
[- Release the bindings at session release.]{.underline}
[- Open/close gates between domains (i.e. packets filtering depending on \"IP
address / port\").]{.underline}
[- Perform packet marking.]{.underline}
[- Resource allocation and bandwidth reservation for upstream and downstream
traffic.]{.underline}
[- Policing of incoming traffic.]{.underline}
[The above functions may or may not instantiated by the IBCF depending on
local policy and incoming signalling information. Additionally, the IBCF may
decide, in some cases, based on the SIP signalling and operator-specific
policy, not to contact the RACS.]{.underline}
