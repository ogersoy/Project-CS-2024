# 1 Scope
The present document contains a detailed description of the handover
procedures to be used in PLMNs. The purpose of the handover procedures, as
described in the present document, are to ensure that the connection to the
Mobile Station (MS) or User Equipment (UE) is maintained as it moves from one
cell or radio network to another. The document defines the circuit switched
handover functionality based on the service requirements in 3GPP TS 22.129
[9]. For the circuit switched handover functionality related to SRVCC, it is
based on the service requirements in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26].
The present document considers the following fivehandover cases:
i) handover between Base Station Subsystems (BSS) connected to the same MSC,
this is termed an Intra-MSC handover;
ii) handover between Radio Network Subsystems (RNS) connected to the same
3G_MSC, this is termed an Intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation. This case also
includes inter-system handover between RNS and BSS if the 3G_MSC supports the
A-interface. In the context of this specification the term RNS refers also to
a BSS when serving a mobile station in Iu mode. Furthermore, this case
includes Intra-3G_MSC enhanced SRNS relocation between two RNSs;
iii) handover between Base Station Subsystems connected to different MSCs,
this is termed an Inter-MSC handover. This category can be sub-divided into
three further procedures:
a) the Basic Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over from a
controlling MSC (MSC‑A) to another MSC (MSC‑B);
b) the Subsequent Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over
from MSC‑B to a third MSC (MSC‑B\');
c) the Subsequent Inter-MSC handback, where the MS is handed back from MSC‑B
to MSC‑A.
iv) handover between Radio Network Subsystems connected to different 3G_MSCs,
this is termed an Inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation. In the context of this
specification the term RNS also refers to a BSS when serving a mobile station
in Iu mode. This category can be divided into three further sub-procedures:
a) the Inter-3G_MSC Handover procedure from UMTS to GSM, where the UE/MS is
handed over from a controlling 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑A) to an MSC (MSC‑B);
b) the Inter-3G_MSC Handover procedure from GSM to UMTS, where the UE/MS is
handed over from a controlling MSC (MSC‑A) to a 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑B);
c) the Inter-3G_MSC Relocation procedure, where the UE is relocated from
3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B. This procedure can also be combined with a hard change
of radio resources (Hard Handover with switch in the core network).
> The MSC in items a) and b) this category can optionally be a 3G_MSC
> supporting the A-interface. The three sub-procedures also cover subsequent
> handover/relocation to a third MSC‑B\' or 3G_MSC‑B\' and subsequent
> handover/relocation back to MSC‑A or 3G_MSC‑A.
v) handover within one BSS connected via AoIP, supported by the same MSC, this
is termed \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\". It is in fact a kind of
external handover from MSC perspective and therefore a subset of i) but
described in detail in separate subclause 6.3 for clarity. The MSC in this
category can be any of MSC-A, MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A or 3G_MSC-B.
In both cases i) and iii) the same procedures as defined in the 3GPP TS 48.008
[5] and the 3GPP TS 24.008 [10] shall be used on the A‑interface and on the
Radio Interface, respectively.
In case ii) the same procedures as defined in the 3GPP TS 25.413 [11] and the
3GPP TS 24.008 [10] shall be used on the Iu‑interface. If the 3G_MSC in case
ii) also supports the A-interface, the 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and the 3GPP TS
24.008 [10] shall be used on the A‑interface.
In case iii) the handover procedures shall transport the A-interface messages
between MSC‑A and MSC‑B described in the Mobile Application Part (MAP), 3GPP
TS 29.002 [12].
In case iv) the handover procedures shall transport the A-interface messages
between 3G_MSC and MSC described in the Mobile Application Part (MAP), 3GPP TS
29.002 [12].
In case iv) the relocation procedure shall transport the Iu-interface messages
between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B described in the Mobile Application Part (MAP),
3GPP TS 29.002 [12].
The interworking between the 3GPP TS 29.002 [12] protocol and the 3GPP TS
48.008 [5] protocol is described in the 3GPP TS 29.010 [8].
Multicall supplementary service is not applicable in GERAN Iu mode and
relocation of Multicalls is therefore only possible within UTRAN.
Enhanced SRNS relocation is possible only within UTRAN between two RNSs
conntected to the same 3G_MSC, i.e. in case ii).
Handovers, which take place on the same MSC are termed Intra-MSC handovers;
this includes both Inter-BSS and Intra‑BSS handovers.
Handovers, which take place on the same 3G_MSC are termed Intra-3G_MSC
handovers; this includes Inter-RNS handovers and optionally RNS to BSS and BSS
to RNS handovers.
In the context of this specification the term InterSystem handover can also
refer to a handover which takes place between a Base Station serving a mobile
station in Iu mode and a Base Station serving a mobile in A/Gb mode.
\"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation\" Option (see 3GPP TS 23.221
[19], subclause 4.2.1): Up to release 99 an RNS can be connected only to one
3G_MSC. From release 4 onwards, as a network option, an RNS can have Iu
interfaces to more than one MSC. Such an additional Iu interface may be
selected by an MSC during an intra-PLMN relocation or intra-PLMN BSS to RNS
handover procedure. This allows the MSC to use an Intra-3G_MSC handover
procedure according to case ii) instead of an Inter-3G_MSC handover procedure
according to case iv). The decision whether to use the Intra-3G_MSC handover
procedure is implementation and configuration dependent. In a network
implementing this option, a global title based on the Global RNC-Id may
optionally be used for the addressing of the Iu interface messages.
\"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" Option (see 3GPP
TS 23.236 [18]): when applied, a BSS or an RNS can be connected to more than
one MSC.
The present document also covers the requirements for handover in ongoing GSM
voice group calls, directed retry and handover without a circuit connection
between (U)MSCs. The present document does not consider the case of handovers
between radio channels on the same BSS (Intra-BSS handover) or the handover of
packet radio services except for case v), the \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC
Support\" for Intra-BSS handover in AoIP, involving the MSC as described in
subclause 6.3. The Inter-RNS handover case that results in a relocation is
covered by the present document, but not other Inter-RNS or Intra-RNS handover
cases.
For voice broadcast calls in GSM, the speaker uses normal point-to-point
handover procedures, whilst the listeners use idle mode cell reselection
procedures, as for the voice group call listeners.
Voice group calls is only applicable to GSM and handover of voice group calls
is therefore only possible in GSM.
Inter-MSC hand-over imposes a few limitations on the system. After inter-MSC
hand-over:
\- call re-establishment is not supported.
The list of 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] features supported during and after Inter-MSC
handover is given in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7].
In the Inter-MSC handover case, the interworking between a Phase 1 BSSMAP
protocol possibly used by one MSC and the Phase 2 BSSMAP protocol used in the
Phase 2 MAP protocol on the E-interface is performed by this MSC.
This specification assumes TDM based Core Network and therefore PCM, ITU-T
G.711 [16] encoded, voice channel for speech calls between MSC-A and MSC-B and
toward the other party. For bearer independent CS Core Network architecture
implementations see 3GPP TS 23.205 [23] and 3GPP TS 23.231 [24]. For handover
including Out-Of-Band transcoder control and transcoder free operation see
3GPP TS 23.153 [25].
NOTE: The message primitive names used in the SDL diagrams and message flows
in the present document do not represent the actual messages specified in the
GSM or 3GPP stage 3 technical specifications. The primitive names are only
intended to be indicative of their use in the present document.
The MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC as specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26] follows
the procedures defined for 3G_MSC-A in the present specification with the
exceptions and additions as specified in subclause 4.5.

## 3.2 Definitions
The following terms are used in this Technical Specification:
**A/Gb mode** : mode of operation of the MS when connected to the Core Network
via GERAN and the A and/or Gb interfaces. Throughout this specification the
term GSM refers to GERAN A/Gb mode _._
**Iu mode** : mode of operation of the MS when connected to the Core Network
via GERAN or UTRAN and the Iu interface. Throughout this specification the
term UMTS refers to UTRAN or GERAN Iu mode.
**Iur interface:** the logical interface between two UTRAN RNSs.
**Iur-g interface:** the logical interface between two BSSs or a BSC and an
RNC and it is only considered in Iu mode.
**Iu Currently used codec:** the codec used by the UE/MS in UTRAN or GERAN Iu
mode before a handover or SRNS relocation.
**Iu Selected codec:** the codec to be used by the UE/MS in UTRAN or GERAN Iu

**Iu Supported Codecs List:** a list of codecs supported by the MS and by the
core network, provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A to 3G_MSC-B during Inter-MSC
handover/relocation. The Iu Supported Codecs List may contain separate list of
codecs for UTRAN Iu mode and GERAN Iu mode. Within each list, the codecs are
ordered in decreasing order of priority, the first entry in the list being the
highest priority codec (preferred codec) and the last entry the lowest
priority codec.
**Default speech codec:** In UTRAN Iu mode the default speech codec is the
UMTS AMR or UMTS AMR2 codec, dependent on the capabilities of the UE/MS. For a
description of how the network determines the default UMTS speech codec, see
3GPP TS 24.008 [10], subclause 5.2.1.11. If necessary, 3G_MSC-B shall use the
Radio Resource Information instead of the GSM Bearer Capability, since the GSM
Bearer Capability is not available in MSC-B.
In GERAN Iu mode the default speech codec is the AMR FR codec.
**UE Specific Behaviour Information - Iu (UESBI-Iu**): information that is
sent from the MSC to the RAN and that can be used to derive specific
information about the UE\'s capabilities.
# 4 Role, functional composition of MSCs and interfaces for handover
## 4.1 MSC-A
### 4.1.1 Role of MSC-A
In the Intra-MSC handover case (including \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC
Support\" with AoIP), the MSC‑A (simply termed MSC) controls the call, the
mobility management and the radio resources before, during and after an Intra-
MSC handover. When BSSAP procedures have to be performed, they are initiated
and driven by MSC‑A.
If AoIP is supported by MSC-A and BSS, then the BSS or the MSC-A may initiate
a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in
subclause 6.3.
In the Inter-MSC handover case, MSC‑A is the MSC which controls the call and
the mobility management of the Mobile during the call, before, during and
after a basic or subsequent handover. When BSSAP procedures related to
dedicated resources have to be performed towards the MS, they are initiated
and driven by MSC‑A. The MSC‑A - MSC‑B interface works as a MSC - BSS
interface for a subset of BSSMAP procedures. These BSSMAP procedures,
described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are only those related to dedicated resources.
The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently by MSC‑B between MSC‑A and the
MS.
During a basic handover, MSC‑A initiates and controls all the handover
procedure, from its initiation (reception of Handover Required from BSS-A on
A-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from MSC‑B
on E-interface).
For handover to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to
Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, MSC-A can have multiple target CN nodes for
each handover target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236 [18].
During a subsequent handover back to MSC‑A, MSC‑A acts as a BSS towards MSC‑B,
which controls the handover procedure until the termination in MSC‑A of the
handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request
Acknowledge to MSC‑B from MSC‑A). Then all handover related messages shall
terminate at MSC‑A (e.g. Handover Detect/Complete from BSS-B, Handover Failure
from BSS-A).
During a subsequent handover to a third MSC, MSC‑A works towards MSC‑B\' as
described above in the basic handover paragraph and towards MSC‑B as described
above in subsequent handover paragraph.
In the Inter-System, inter-MSC handover case, MSC‑A is the MSC which controls
the call and the mobility management of the Mobile during the call, before,
during and after a basic or subsequent handover. When BSSAP procedures related
to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the MS, they are initiated
and driven by MSC‑A. The MSC‑A - 3G_MSC‑B interface works as a MSC - BSS
interface for a subset of BSSMAP procedures. These BSSMAP procedures,
described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are only those related to dedicated resources.
The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently by 3G_MSC‑B between MSC‑A and the
MS.
During a basic inter-system handover, MSC‑A initiates and controls all the
handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Handover Required from
BSS-A on A-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete
from 3G_MSC‑B on E-interface).
During a subsequent inter-system handover back to MSC‑A, MSC‑A acts as a BSS
towards 3G_MSC‑B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination
in MSC‑A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover
Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC‑B from MSC‑A). Then all handover related
messages shall terminate at MSC‑A (e.g. Handover Detect/Complete from BSS-B,
Handover Failure from BSS-A).
During a subsequent inter-system handover to a third MSC, MSC‑A works towards
3G_MSC‑B\' as described above in the basic inter-system handover paragraph and
towards 3G_MSC‑B as described above in subsequent inter-system handover
paragraph.
If MSC-A supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour Information to
Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 [21]), it shall send UESBI-Iu to the
target MSC during basic and subsequent handover, and basic and subsequent
inter-system handover.
### 4.1.2 Functional composition of MSC‑A and its interfaces for handover
In order to simplify the description of the handover procedures the
controlling MSC (MSC‑A) can be considered to be composed of five functional
units, as shown in figure 1.
Signalling functions:
1) BSC/MSC (MS/BSC) Procedures MSC‑A. This unit is used to control the
signalling between the MSC, BSC and MS. Interface A\' is the connection to the
old BSC and interface A\'\' is the connection to the new BSC, when an Intra-
MSC handover takes place. Interface x represents the interworking connection
to the Handover Control Procedures MSC‑A.
2) Call Control Procedures MSC‑A. This unit is used to control the call.
Interface B\' is used for normal call control procedures. When a Basic
handover from MSC‑A to MSC‑B is to be performed then interface B\'\' is
employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to MSC‑B. If a
Subsequent handover to MSC‑B\' is to be performed then interface B\'\'\' is
used. Similarly, when a Basic inter-system handover from MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B is
to be performed, then interface B\'\' is employed to provide a signalling and
call control connection to 3G_MSC‑B. If a subsequent inter-system handover to
3G_MSC‑B\' is to be performed, then interface B\'\'\' is used.
3) Handover Control Procedures MSC‑A. This unit provides both the overall
control of the handover procedure and interworking between the internal
interfaces (x, y and z).
4) MAP Procedures MSC‑A. This unit is responsible for controlling the exchange
of MAP messages between MSCs during an Inter-MSC handover, or between MSC‑A
and 3G_MSC‑B during an Inter-system Inter-MSC handover. This unit communicates
with the Handover Control Procedures MSC‑A via interface z.
Switching functions:
5) Switch and Handover Device MSC‑A. For all calls, except for ongoing voice
group calls (see 3GPP TS 43.068 [3] for a definition) this unit is responsible
for connecting the new path into the network via interface B\'. In the case of
ongoing voice group calls this unit is responsible for maintaining the
connection between the down link group call channels and the active uplink. In
specific cases it may be unnecessary to take any explicit action in the MSC
concerning the handover device. The handover device interconnections are
illustrated in figure 2.
Figure 1: Functional composition of the controlling MSC (MSC-A) for supporting
handover
For MS to MS calls in the same MSC the configuration in figure 2b applies. In
this case interface B\'\' is internal to MSC‑A and does not connect to another
MSC.
The handover device can either be a three-party bridge or a switching facility
without three-party connection capabilities. For a three-party bridge
configuration the states of the handover device are as shown in table 1. The
three‑party configuration exists in the intermediate state. This type of
handover device may reduce the interruption time. However, this may require
noise reduction if one of the radio channels is unterminated at some time in
the intermediate state.
For a handover device consisting of a simple switch there will be no
intermediate state.

## 4.2 MSC‑B
### 4.2.1 Role of MSC‑B
In the Intra-MSC-B handover cases (including \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC
Support\" with AoIP), the MSC‑B keeps the control of the whole Intra-MSC-B
handover procedure.
MSC-B notifies MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A of a successful Intra-MSC-B handover
completion by using the A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.
If AoIP is supported by MSC-B and BSS, then the BSS or the MSC-B may initiate
a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in
subclause 6.3.
In the Inter-MSC handover case, the role of MSC‑B (MSC‑B\') is only to provide
radio resources control within its area. This means that MSC‑B keeps control
of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSC‑B will do
some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or
A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between
A‑interface and E-interface. MSC‑A initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP
procedures towards MSC‑B, while MSC‑B controls them towards its BSSs to the
extent that MSC‑B is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release
of the dedicated resources between MSC‑B and BSS-B is under the responsibility
of MSC‑B and BSS‑B, and is not directly controlled by MSC‑A. When clearing is
to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, MSC‑B shall transfer
this clearing indication to MSC‑A, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to
terminate the dialogue with MSC‑A through the E‑interface, and to release its
circuit connection with MSC‑A, if any. In the same way, the release of the
connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by MSC‑B, when the dialogue with MSC‑A
ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with
MSC‑A, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSC‑A ends abnormally.
When a release is received by MSC‑B for the circuit connection with MSC‑A then
MSC‑B shall release the circuit connection.
In the Inter-system Inter-MSC handover case, the role of MSC‑B (MSC‑B\') is
only to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that MSC‑B
keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B.
MSC‑B will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the
E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information
transparently between A‑interface and E-interface. 3G_MSC‑A initiates and
drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSC‑B, while MSC‑B controls them
towards its BSSs to the extent that MSC‑B is responsible for the connections
of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSC‑B and BSS-B is
under the responsibility of MSC‑B and BSS‑B, and is not directly controlled by
3G_MSC‑A. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from
BSS-B, MSC‑B shall transfer this clearing indication to 3G_MSC‑A, to clear its
connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A through the
E‑interface, and to release its circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A, if any. In
the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by
MSC‑B, when the dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A ends normally and a release is received
from the circuit connection with MSC‑A, if any, or when the dialogue with the
MSC‑A ends abnormally.
When a release is received by MSC‑B for the circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A
then MSC‑B shall release the circuit connection.
For subsequent inter-MSC handover to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection
of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, MSC-B can have multiple target
CN nodes for each handover target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS
23.236 [18].
### 4.2.2 Functional composition of MSC‑B and its interfaces for handover
The functional composition of an MSC acting as MSC‑B is essentially the same
as that of MSC‑A. However, there are some differences. The functional units
are as follows (see figure 3).
Signalling functions:
1) BSC/MSC (MS/BSC) Procedures MSC‑B. This unit is used to control the
signalling between the MSC, BSC and MS. Interface A\'\' is the connection to
the new BSC, when an Intra-MSC handover takes place. Interface x represents
the interworking connection to the Handover Control Procedures MSC‑B.
2) Call Control Procedures MSC‑B. This unit is used for normal call control
and signalling to MSC‑A, or 3G_MSC‑A in the case of inter-system inter-MSC
handover.
3) Handover Control Procedures MSC‑B. This unit provides both the overall
control of the handover procedure and interworking between the internal
interfaces (x, y and z) in MSC‑B.
4) MAP Procedures MSC‑B. This unit is responsible for controlling the exchange
of MAP messages between MSC‑A, or 3G_MSC‑A, and MSC‑B and for signalling to
the VLR in MSC‑B.
Switching functions:
5) Switch MSC‑B. For all calls, except ongoing voice group calls (see 3GPP TS
43.068 [3] for a definition) this unit is responsible, with BSS-B, for
connecting the circuit from MSC‑A, or 3G_MSC‑A, to BSS-B. This unit may also
need to act as a handover device for Intra-MSC handovers controlled by MSC‑B.
In the case of ongoing voice group calls this unit is responsible for
maintaining the connection between the group member currently assigned the
uplink and the distribution device. In specific cases it may be unnecessary to
take any explicit action in the MSC concerning the handover device.

## 4.3 3G_MSC‑A
For roles and functional composition of the 3G_MSC‑A working as pure GSM MSC,
please see previous clause (\"MSC‑A\").
### 4.3.1 Role of 3G_MSC‑A
In the Intra-3G_MSC-A handover/relocation case, 3G_MSC‑A controls the call,
the mobility management and the radio resources before, during and after an
Intra-3G_MSC-A handover/relocation. When RANAP or BSSMAP procedures have to be
performed, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC‑A.
In a network implementing the \"Flexible Iu interface for
handover/relocation\" option, 3G_MSC-A may optionally use a global title based
on the Global RNC-Id for the addressing of the Iu interface messages towards
the target RNC.
For handover/relocation to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN
Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, 3G_MSC-A can have multiple target CN
nodes for each handover/relocation target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.236 [18].
In the case of intra-3G_MSC-A handover of a speech call, 3G_MSC‑A controls the
transcoder in the core network. The 3G_MSC‑A determines, if a transcoder is
required to be inserted or released in the CN.
If AoIP is supported by 3G_MSC-A and BSS, then the BSS or the 3G_MSC-A may
initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail
in subclause 6.3.
In the case of Inter-3G_MSC relocation, 3G_MSC-A links out the transcoder.
In the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, 3G_MSC‑A is the 3G_MSC that controls the
call and the mobility management of the UE during the call, before, during and
after a basic or subsequent relocation. When RANAP procedures related to
dedicated resources have to be performed towards the UE, they are initiated
and driven by 3G_MSC‑A. The 3G_MSC‑A - 3G_MSC‑B interface works as a 3G_MSC -
RNS interface for the RANAP procedures. The Direct Transfer signalling is
relayed transparently by 3G_MSC‑B between 3G_MSC‑A and the UE.
During a successful relocation the order to perform location reporting at
change of Service Area is not transferred to the target RNS. In the
Intra-3G_MSC-A relocation case, the 3G_MSC-A re-issues the Location Reporting
Control towards the target RNS. In the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, 3G_MSC-A
keeps the control of the Location Report Control procedure. However, re-
issuing the Iu-LOCATION-REPORTING-CONTROL messages due to subsequent
Intra-3G_MSC-B relocations is the responsibility of 3G_MSC-B.
During a basic relocation, 3G_MSC‑A initiates and controls all the relocation
procedure, from its initiation (reception of Relocation Required from RNS-A on
Iu-interface) until its completion (reception of Relocation Complete from
3G_MSC‑B on E-interface).
During a subsequent relocation back to 3G_MSC‑A, 3G_MSC‑A acts as an RNS
towards 3G_MSC‑B, which controls the relocation procedure until the
termination in 3G_MSC‑A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of
the Relocation Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC‑B from 3G_MSC‑A). Then all
relocation related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC‑A (e.g. Relocation
Detect/Complete from RNS-B, Relocation Cancel from RNS-A).
During a subsequent relocation to a third 3G_MSC-B\', 3G_MSC‑A works towards
3G_MSC‑B\' as described above in the basic relocation paragraph and towards
3G_MSC‑B as described above in subsequent relocation paragraph.
In the Inter-System, inter-3G_MSC handover case, 3G_MSC‑A is the 3G_MSC which
controls the call and the mobility management of the UE/MS during the call,
before, during and after a basic or subsequent inter-system handover. When
BSSAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards
the UE/MS, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC‑A. The 3G_MSC‑A -- MSC‑B
interface works as a 3G_MSC \-- BSS interface for a subset of BSSMAP
procedures. These BSSMAP procedures described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are those
related to dedicated resources. The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently
by MSC‑B between 3G_MSC‑A and the UE/MS.
During a basic inter-system UMTS to GSM handover, 3G_MSC‑A initiates and
controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of
Relocation Required from RNS-A on Iu-interface) until its completion
(reception of Handover Complete from MSC‑B on E-interface).
During a subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover back to 3G_MSC‑A,
3G_MSC‑A acts as a BSS towards 3G_MSC‑B, which controls the handover procedure
until the termination in 3G_MSC‑A of the handover radio resources allocation
(sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC‑B from 3G_MSC‑A). Then
all handover related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC‑A (e.g. Handover
Detect/Complete from BSS-B, Relocation Cancel from RNS-A).
During a subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover to a third 3G_MSC,
3G_MSC‑A works towards MSC‑B\' as described above in the basic inter-system
handover paragraph and towards 3G_MSC‑B as described above in subsequent
inter-system handover paragraph.
During a basic inter-system GSM to UMTS handover, 3G_MSC‑A initiates and
controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of
Handover Required from BSS-A on A-interface) until its completion (reception
of Handover Complete from 3G_MSC‑B on E-interface).
During a subsequent inter-system GSM to UMTS handover back to 3G_MSC‑A,
3G_MSC‑A acts as an RNS towards MSC‑B, which controls the handover procedure
until the termination in 3G_MSC‑A of the handover radio resources allocation
(sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to MSC‑B from 3G_MSC‑A). Then all
handover related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC‑A (e.g. Relocation
Detect/Complete from RNS-B, Handover Failure from BSS‑A).
During a subsequent inter-system GSM to UMTS handover to a third 3G_MSC,
3G_MSC‑A works towards 3G_MSC‑B\' as described above in the basic inter-system
handover paragraph and towards MSC‑B as described above in subsequent inter-
system handover paragraph.
3G_MSC-A may assign a priority level defined as RAB parameter in 3GPP TS
25.413 [11] for each bearer. In case of relocation of a multicall
configuration the 3G_MSC-B or the target RNC shall select the bearers to be
handed over according to the priority level, if the target cell is not able to
accommodate all bearers. If a selection has to be made between bearers of the
same priority level, then the selection criteria are implementation dependent.
For network sharing (see 3GPP TS 25.401 [20], subclause 7.2.3) 3G MSC-A shall
send the SNA information to 3G_MSC-B except for emergency calls.
If 3G_MSC-A supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS
23.135 [17]) and UE is engaged with multiple bearers the following description
applies:
\- In the Intra-3G_MSC relocation case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all
bearers to a new RNS.
\- In the basic relocation case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to
3G_MSC-B. If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that the 3G_MSC-B does not
support multiple bearers, then 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to
be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries again to relocate the
selected bearer.
\- In the subsequent relocation to a third 3G_MSC-B\' case, the 3G-MSC-A tries
to relocate all bearers to 3G_MSC-B\'. If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that
the 3G_MSC-B\' does not support multiple bearers, then 3G_MSC-A shall be able
to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and
tries again to relocate the selected bearer.
\- In the Intra-3G_MSC inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case and the basic
inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case, the 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select
one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries to
handover the selected bearer.
\- In all cases described above, 3G_MSC-A shall release some calls which has
been carried by the bearers failed to set up in new RNS or the bearers not to
be handed over.
If 3G_MSC-A supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour Information to
Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 [21]), it shall send UESBI-Iu to the
RNS-B during intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation and during subsequent
inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A. Furthermore, 3G_MSC-A shall
send UESBI-Iu to the target MSC during basic and subsequent inter-MSC
handover, and basic and subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation.
For a SCUDIF call (see 3GPP TS 23.172 [22]) 3G_MSC-A may send information of
the alternative radio access bearer to the target RNS during the intra-3G_MSC
handover/relocation and to the target MSC during basic and subsequent
inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation or assignment.
### 4.3.2 Functional composition of 3G_MSC‑A and its interfaces for
handover/relocation
In order to simplify the description of the handover/relocation procedures the
controlling 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑A) can be considered to be composed of five
functional units, as shown in figure 4.
Signalling functions:
1) RNC/BSC/3G_MSC (UE/MS/RNC/BSC) Procedures 3G_MSC‑A. This unit is used to
control the signalling between the 3G_MSC, RNC or BSC and UE/MS. Interface
Iu\' is the connection to the old RNC and interface Iu\'\' is the connection
to the new RNC, when an Intra-3G_MSC relocation takes place. Interface Iu\' is
the connection to the old RNC and interface A\'\' is the connection to the new
BSC, when an Intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover takes place. Interface A\' is
the connection to the old BSC and interface Iu\'\' is the connection to the
new RNC, when an Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover takes place. Interface x
represents the interworking connection to the Handover/Relocation Control
Procedures 3G_MSC‑A.
2) Call Control Procedures 3G_MSC‑A. This unit is used to control the call.
Interface B\' is used for normal call control procedures. When a Basic
relocation from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B is to be performed then interface B\'\'
is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC‑B.
If a Subsequent handover/relocation to 3G_MSC‑B\' is to be performed then
interface B\'\'\' is used. Similarly, when a Basic inter-system handover from
3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B is to be performed, then interface B\'\' is employed to
provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC‑B. If a Subsequent
inter-system handover to 3G_MSC‑B\' is to be performed then interface B\'\'\'
is used.
3) Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC‑A. This unit provides both
the overall control of the handover/relocation procedure and interworking
between the internal interfaces (x, y and z).
4) MAP Procedures 3G_MSC‑A. This unit is responsible for controlling the
exchange of MAP messages between 3G_MSCs during an Inter-3G_MSC
handover/relocation, or between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B during an Inter-system
Inter-3G_MSC handover. This unit communicates with the Handover/Relocation
Control Procedures 3G_MSC‑A via interface z.
Switching functions:
5) Switch and Handover/Relocation Device 3G_MSC‑A. For all calls this unit is
responsible for connecting the new path into the network via interface B\'. In
specific cases it may be unnecessary to take any explicit action in the 3G_MSC
concerning the handover/relocation device. The handover/relocation device
interconnections are illustrated in figure 5.
Figure 4: Functional composition of the controlling 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑A)\ for
supporting handover/relocation
For UE/MS to UE/MS calls in the same 3G_MSC the configuration in figure 5b
applies. In this case interface B\'\' is internal to 3G_MSC‑A and does not
connect to another 3G_MSC.
The handover/relocation device can be either a three-party bridge or a
switching facility without three-party connection capabilities. For a three-
party bridge configuration the states of the handover/relocation device are as
shown in table 2. The three-party configuration exists in the intermediate
state. This type of handover/relocation device may reduce the interruption
time. However, this may require noise reduction if one of the radio channels
is unterminated at some time in the intermediate state.
For a handover/relocation device consisting of a simple switch there will be
no intermediate state.

NOTE: In a) and b) Iu' is released after handover/relocation;
In c) B'' is released after handover/relocation.

## 4.4 3G_MSC‑B
For roles and functional composition of the 3G_MSC‑B working as pure GSM MSC,
please see previous clause (\"MSC‑B\").
### 4.4.1 Role of 3G_MSC‑B
In the Intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation case, the 3G_MSC‑B keeps the control
of the whole Intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation procedure. 3G_MSC-B notifies
MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A of intra-3G_MSC-B InterSystem handover and intra GSM
handovers (including \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\"), by using the
A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.
\- If the security algorithms have been changed during an intra-3G_MSC-B SRNS
relocation; or
\- if the codec type or codec modes of the Iu Selected codec have been changed
during this relocation and the Iu Supported Codecs List was received by
3G_MSC-B before,
then 3G_MSC-B shall indicate the changed parameters, i.e. the selected UMTS
algorithm(s) and/or the codec type and codec modes of the Iu Selected codec,
to MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request.
Encapsulated in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request 3G_MSC-B shall send:
\- an A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message, when encapsulated BSSAP is used on the E
interface; or
\- an Iu-LOCATION-REPORT message, when encapsulated RANAP is used on the E
interface.
On reception of an order to perform location reporting at change of Service
Area from 3G_MSC-A, 3G_MSC-B shall be responsible to re-issue the Iu-LOCATION-
REPORTING-CONTROL message after subsequent Intra-3G_MSC-B
relocations/handovers. This shall be performed immediately after the
successful completion of the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure.
In a network implementing the \"Flexible Iu interface for
handover/relocation\" option, in the Intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation case,
3G_MSC-B may optionally use a global title based on the Global RNC-Id for the
addressing of the Iu interface messages towards the target RNC.
If AoIP is supported by 3G_MSC-B and BSS, then the BSS or the 3G_MSC-B may
initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail
in subclause 6.3.
For subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation to an area where \"Intra Domain
Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, 3G_MSC-B can have
multiple target CN nodes for each handover target in a pool-area as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.236 [18].
The role of 3G_MSC‑B is also to provide transcoder resources. For speech calls
in UMTS, 3G_MSC-B shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu Supported
Codecs List provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. If
the Iu Supported Codecs List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the
selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC-B shall
select the appropriate default speech codec.
If an intra-3G_MSC-B intersystem handover to UMTS is performed, the Iu
Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B during the basic inter MSC
handover/relocation procedure and 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec
based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then 3G_MSC-B shall indicate the Iu
Selected codec to MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A in MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request.
In the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, the role of 3G_MSC‑B (3G_MSC‑B\') is only
to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that 3G_MSC‑B
keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards RNS-B.
3G_MSC‑B will do some processing on the RANAP information received on the
E-interface or the RANAP information received on the Iu-interface whereas it
will relay the Direct Transfer information transparently between Iu‑interface
and E-interface. 3G_MSC‑A initiates and drives RANAP procedures towards
3G_MSC‑B, while 3G_MSC‑B controls them towards its RNSs to the extent that
3G_MSC‑B is responsible for the connections of its RNSs. The release of the
dedicated resources between 3G_MSC‑B and RNS-B is under the responsibility of
3G_MSC‑B and RNS‑B, and is not directly controlled by 3G_MSC‑A. When clearing
is to be performed due to information received from RNS-B, 3G_MSC‑B shall
transfer this clearing indication to 3G_MSC‑A, to clear its connection with
RNS-B, to terminate the dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A through the E‑interface, and to
release its circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A, if any. In the same way, the
release of the connection to its RNS-B, is initiated by 3G_MSC‑B, when the
dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A ends normally and a release is received from the
circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A, if any, or when the dialogue with the
3G_MSC‑A ends abnormally.
When a release is received by 3G_MSC‑B for the circuit connection with
3G_MSC‑A then 3G_MSC‑B shall release the circuit connection.
In the Inter-system UMTS to GSM Inter-3G_MSC handover case, the role of
3G_MSC‑B (3G_MSC‑B\') is only to provide radio resources control within its
area. This means that 3G_MSC‑B keeps control of the radio resources connection
and release towards BSS-B. 3G_MSC‑B will do some processing on the BSSMAP
information received on the E-interface or the BSSMAP information received on
the A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently
between A‑interface and E-interface. 3G_MSC‑A initiates and drives a subset of
BSSMAP procedures towards 3G_MSC‑B, while 3G_MSC‑B controls them towards its
BSSs to the extent that 3G_MSC‑B is responsible for the connections of its
BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between 3G_MSC‑B and BSS-B is
under the responsibility of 3G_MSC‑B and BSS‑B, and is not directly controlled
by 3G_MSC‑A. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from
BSS-B, 3G_MSC‑B shall transfer this clearing indication to 3G_MSC‑A, to clear
its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A through the
E‑interface, and to release its circuit connection with MSC‑A, if any. In the
same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by
3G_MSC‑B, when the dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A ends normally and a release is
received from the circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A, if any, or when the
dialogue with the MSC‑A ends abnormally.
When a release is received by 3G_MSC‑B for the circuit connection with
3G_MSC‑A then 3G_MSC‑B shall release the circuit connection.
In the Inter-system GSM to UMTS Inter-3G_MSC handover case, the role of
3G_MSC‑B (3G_MSC‑B\') is only to provide radio resources control within its
area. This means that 3G_MSC‑B keeps control of the radio resources connection
and release towards RNS-B. 3G_MSC‑B will do some processing on the BSSMAP
information received on the E-interface or the RANAP information received on
the Iu-interface whereas it will relay the Direct Transfer information
transparently between Iu‑interface and E-interface. MSC‑A initiates and drives
a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards 3G_MSC‑B, while 3G_MSC‑B controls them
towards its RNSs to the extent that 3G_MSC‑B is responsible for the
connections of its RNSs. The release of the dedicated resources between
3G_MSC‑B and RNS-B is under the responsibility of 3G_MSC‑B and RNS‑B, and is
not directly controlled by MSC‑A. When clearing is to be performed due to
information received from RNS-B, 3G_MSC‑B shall transfer this clearing
indication to MSC‑A, to clear its connection with RNS-B, to terminate the
dialogue with MSC‑A through the E‑interface, and to release its circuit
connection with MSC‑A, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection
to its RNS-B, is initiated by 3G_MSC‑B, when the dialogue with MSC‑A ends
normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSC‑A, if
any, or when the dialogue with the MSC‑A ends abnormally.
When a release is received by 3G_MSC‑B for the circuit connection with MSC‑A
then 3G_MSC‑B shall release the circuit connection.
At intra-PLMN handover/relocation, 3G_MSC-B shall send Service Handover
related information to the BSC/RNC if and only if this Service Handover
information is received from 3G_MSC-A. 3G_MSC-B shall not modify Service
Handover related information received from a 3G_MSC-A within the same PLMN.
For network sharing (see 3GPP TS 25.401 [20], subclause 7.2.3) when SNA
information is received by 3G_MSC-B from 3G_MSC-A, 3G MSC-B shall send the SNA
information to the RNS.
If 3G_MSC-B does not support the optional supplementary service Multicall (see
3GPP TS 23.135 [17]) and 3G_MSC-A requests to relocate multiple bearers,
3G_MSC-B shall indicate that it does not support multiple bearers to 3G_MSC-A.
If 3G_MSC-B supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (see 3GPP TS
23.135 [17]) and UE is engaged with multiple bearers the following description
applies:
\- In the basic relocation case, the 3G_MSC-B shall be able to allocate a
Handover Number for each bearer. The 3G_MSC-B shall also be able to select
some bearers to be handed over according to the priority level defined as RAB
parameters in 3GPP TS 25.413 [11] so that the number of bearers will fulfill
the maximum number of bearers supported by the 3G_MSC-B. If a selection has to
be made between bearers of the same priority level, then the selection
criteria are implementation dependent.
\- In the Intra-3G_MSC relocation case, the 3G_MSC-B tries to relocate all
bearers to a new RNS.
\- In the subsequent relocation back to the 3G_MSC-A or to a third 3G_MSC-B\'
case, the 3G_MSC-B tries to request to the 3G_MSC-A to relocate all bearers to
the 3G_MSC-A or to the 3G_MSC-B\'.
\- In the Intra-3G_MSC inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case and the
subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover back to the 3G_MSC-A or to a
third MSC-B\' case, the 3G_MSC-B shall be able to select one bearer to be
handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries to handover the selected
bearer.
If 3G_MSC-B supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour Information to
Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 [21]), and if it received UESBI-Iu from
MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation, then
3G_MSC-B shall store the UESBI-Iu and forward it to RNS-B during basic inter-
MSC handover/relocation and subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation.
If 3G_MSC-B supports SCUDIF calls (see 3GPP TS 23.172 [22]), and if it
received information of alternative radio access bearer from 3G_MSC-A during
the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation or assignment, then 3G_MSC-B shall
store that information and forward it to RNS-B during basic inter-MSC
handover/relocation or assignment and subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B
handover/relocation.
### 4.4.2 Functional composition of 3G_MSC‑B and its interfaces for
handover/relocation
The functional composition of a 3G_MSC acting as 3G_MSC‑B is essentially the
same as that of 3G_MSC‑A. However, there are some differences. The functional
units are as follows (see figure 6).
Signalling functions:
1) RNC/BSC/3G_MSC (UE/MS/RNC/BSC) Procedures 3G_MSC‑B. This unit is used to
control the signalling between the 3G_MSC, RNC, BSC and UE/MS. Interface Iu\'
is the connection to the old RNC and interface Iu\'\' is the connection to the
new RNC, when an Intra-3G_MSC relocation takes place. Interface Iu\' is the
connection to the old RNC and interface A\'\' is the connection to the new
BSC, when an Intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover takes place. Interface A\' is
the connection to the old BSC and interface Iu\'\' is the connection to the
new RNC, when an Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover takes place. Interface x
represents the interworking connection to the Handover/Relocation Control
Procedures 3G_MSC‑B.
2) Call Control Procedures 3G_MSC‑B. This unit is used for normal call control
and signalling to 3G_MSC‑A or MSC‑A in the case of inter-system inter-3G_MSC
handover.
3) Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC‑B. This unit provides both
the overall control of the handover/relocation procedure and interworking
between the internal interfaces (x, y and z) in 3G_MSC‑B.
4) MAP Procedures 3G_MSC‑B. This unit is responsible for controlling the
exchange of MAP messages between 3G_MSC‑A, or MSC‑A, and 3G_MSC‑B and for
signalling to the VLR in 3G_MSC‑B.

5) Switch 3G_MSC‑B. For all calls this unit is responsible, with RNS-B, for
connecting the circuit from 3G_MSC‑A, or MSC‑A, to RNS-B. This unit may also
need to act as a handover/relocation device for Intra-3G_MSC
handovers/relocation controlled by 3G_MSC‑B. In specific cases it may be
unnecessary to take any explicit action in the 3G_MSC concerning the
handover/relocation device.

## 4.5 MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC
### 4.5.1 Role of MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC
MSC Server enhanced for SRVCC (simply termed SRVCC MSC) takes the roles of
3G_MSC-A as defined in subclause 4.3.1 with the following modification for an
SRVCC handover:
\- During a SRVCC handover, SRVCC MSC initiates and controls all the Circuit
Switch handover procedure, from its initiation (i.e., reception of SRVCC PS to
CS Request via the Sv-interface as defined in 3GPP TS 29.280 [27] from MME)
until its completion (i.e., reception of Relocation/Handover Complete from
3G_MSC-B or MSC-B on E-interface or from RANAP or BSSMAP procedure if the
target access network is connected via the same SRVCC MSC).
\- Call flows on the interaction between Sv signalling and the handover
signalling with the target network by SRVCC MSC is defined in 3GPP TS 23.216
[26].
\- SRVCC MSC initiates a normal call setup procedure to IMS with STN-SR for
session continuity procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26].
\- After SRVCC handover is completed, the UE is connected to IMS via target CS
domain access. The subsequent handover to another BSS/RAN or inter-MSC HO
follows the procedures defined for 3G_MSC-A. There is no handover back to
E-UTRAN via the Sv interface.
### 4.5.2 Functional composition of SRVCC MSC and its interfaces for
handover/relocation
Functional composition of SRVCC MSC and its interfaces for handover/relocation
follows the 3G_MSC-A as defined in subclause 4.3.2 with the following
modification for an SRVCC handover:
\- Interface Iu'/A' is not used. This is replaced by Sv interface.
\- Interface B\' is used for normal call control procedure to IMS for SRVCC
session continuity procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26]
\- During SRVCC procedure, B\' is a one-way connection with IMS and is not
connected to Sv interface. After SRVCC procedure is completed, B\' is
connected to A''/Iu''.
# 5 Handover initiation conditions
Handover may be initiated by the network based on RF criteria as measured by
the MS or the Network (signal level, Connection quality, power level
propagation delay) as well as traffic criteria (e.g. current traffic loading
per cell, interference levels, maintenance requests, etc.).
In order to determine if a handover is required, due to RF criteria, it is
typically the MS that shall take radio measurements from neighbouring cells.
These measurements are reported to the serving cell on an event driven or
regular basis. When a network determines a need for executing a handover the
procedures given in 3GPP TS 48.008 [5], 3GPP TS 25.303 [13], 3GPP TS 25.331
[14] are followed.
The decision process used to determine when to perform soft handover or hard
handover will typically differ. Depending on the support for soft or hard
handover the Intra-MSC and Inter-MSC handover may differ.
In the case of an ongoing GSM voice group call (see 3GPP TS 43.068 [3]) the
criteria described above shall only apply to the mobile station currently
assigned the uplink and other users with a dedicated connection, no actions
shall be taken for the listening users.
# 6 General description of the procedures for intra - MSC handovers
This clause gives a brief overview of the procedures that shall be followed
when performing Intra-MSC handovers. Detailed explanation of these procedures
can be found in 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and 3GPP TS 24.008 [10].
There are three types of GSM handover that involve a single BSS and a single
MSC. These are \"Internal Handover\", \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC
Support\" and\" External Handover\".
An \"Internal Handover\" takes place between channels on a cell or cells
controlled by a single BSS, without reference to the MSC, although the MSC
maybe informed of its occurrence after completion. This typical case can be
used by the BSS e.g. if the A-Interface User Plane is not to be modified. This
\"Internal Handover\" may take place with AoTDM or with AoIP and is not
considered in the present document.
A \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" shall only be used if AoIP is
supported by both MSC and BSS and if the A-Interface User Plane has to be
modified. In that case the BSS or the MSC may initiate a \"BSS Internal
Handover with MSC Support\" procedure as described in detail in subclause 6.3
in this document.
NOTE: From Core Network perspective this \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC
Support\" is an \"External Handover\", because the MSC is actively involved,
although it is called \"Internal Handover\" in 3GPP TS 48.008, because the
call stays within one BSS.
Handovers between channels on the same cell or between cells on the same BSS
which are controlled by the MSC (as defined prior to the introduction of AoIP)
are termed \"External Handovers\" and use identical procedures to those for
Inter-BSS-Intra-MSC handovers. \"External Handovers\" are also specified with
AoIP User Plane transport, for example the handover from speech to data
services.Handovers from a BSS to an RNS controlled by the same 3G_MSC are
intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handovers. Handovers from an RNS to a BSS controlled
by the same 3G_MSC are intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handovers.
There are two types of handover in UMTS: soft handover and hard handover. The
first one is fully performed within UTRAN, without involving the core network.
The second one may be also performed within UTRAN or GERAN, or between GERAN
and UTRAN, or the core network may be involved if the Iur or Iur-g interface
between RNSs does not exist. This case of hard handover involving the core
network is covered in the present document, together with SRNS relocation with
Iur or Iur-g interface.
## 6.1 Procedure for Intra-MSC Handovers
The procedure for a successful External Intra-MSC handover is shown in figure
7. It is assumed that selection of a candidate MS has already taken place
within the BSS based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The exact
algorithm, in the BSS, for determining a candidate MS is not addressed in the
present document. The procedures discussed do not make use of the Mobile
Application Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figure 2 and
figure 3. The procedure described in this clause covers case i).
Figure 7: Basic External Intra-MSC Handover Procedure
The successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the BSS (BSS-A),
currently supporting the MS, determines that the MS requires to be handed over
it will send an A‑HANDOVER-REQUIRED message to the MSC (MSC‑A). The
A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message shall contain a list of cells, or a single cell,
to which the MS can be handed over. The list of cells shall be given in order
of preference based upon operator determined criteria (These criteria are not
addressed within the present document and are operator dependent). When the
MSC‑A receives the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of
handing over the MS to a new BSS (BSS-B). (NOTE: BSS-A and BSS-B maybe the
same BSS). The MSC‑A shall generate an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to the
selected BSS (BSS-B). When BSS-B receives the A‑HANDOVER-REQUEST message it
shall take the necessary action to allow the MS to access the radio resource
of BSS-B, this is detailed in 3GPP TS 48.058 [6] and in 3GPP TS 45.008 [4].
The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial
resources is detailed in 3GPP TS 24.008 [10] and 3GPP TS 48.008 [5].
Once resource allocation has been completed by BSS-B it shall return an
A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK. to MSC‑A. When this message is received by MSC‑A it
shall begin the process of instructing the MS to tune to a new dedicated radio
resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the MSC‑A to BSS-A. On receipt
of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio interface message
RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND, containing a Handover Reference number previously
allocated by BSS-B, to the MS. The MS will then access the new radio resource
using the Handover Reference number contained in the RI-HANDOVER-ACCESS
message. The number will be checked by BSS-B to ensure it is as expected and
the correct MS has been captured. If this is the correct MS then the BSS-B
shall send an A-HANDOVER-DETECT to MSC‑A. When the MS is successfully
communicating with the BSS-B a RI-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by
the MS to BSS-B. The BSS-B will then send an A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message to
MSC‑A.
NOTE: The A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK from BSS-B contains the complete Radio
Interface message that shall be sent by BSS-A to the MS in the RI-HANDOVER-
COMMAND, MSC‑A transparently passes this radio interface message onto BSS‑A.
After MSC‑A has received the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B it shall
begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 7 the resource is
released by using the A‑CLEAR-COMMAND sequence.
In the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls the clearing of resources on
BSS-A shall not be used if the resources are still be used on the down link.
If a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-
FAILURE returned from BSS-A or BSS-B, then MSC‑A will terminate the handover
to BSS-B. Under these conditions MSC‑A may optionally take one of a number of
actions:
i) retry the handover to the same cell;
ii) select the next cell from the list contained in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED
message and attempt a handover to the new cell;
iii) await the next A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message;
iv) send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A, if an A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has
not already been sent.
The exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or
after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.
In all cases the existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared except in
the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE.
During the period that the MS is not in communication with the network MSC‑A
shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the
MS once communication is resumed . In the case of an Intra-MSC handover on
MSC‑B then the messages shall be queued by MSC‑B.
In the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls if a failure occurs when handing
over a user on a dedicated channel then the procedures described above may
optionally be applied.
## 6.2 Procedure for Intra-3G_MSC Handovers
### 6.2.1 Intra-3G_MSC Handover from UMTS to GSM
The procedure for a successful Intra-3G_MSC handover from UMTS to GSM is shown
in figure 8. It is assumed that selection of a candidate UE/MS has already
taken place within the RNS based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The
exact algorithm, in the RNS, for determining a candidate UE/MS is not
addressed in the present document. The procedures discussed do not make use of
the Mobile Application Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in
figures 4 and 6. The procedure described in this clause covers case ii).
Figure 8: Basic Intra-3G_MSC Handover from UMTS to GSM Procedure
#### 6.2.1.1 With no bearer or one bearer
The successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the RNS (RNS-A),
currently supporting the UE/MS, determines that the UE/MS requires to be
handed over to GSM it will send an IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message to the
3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑A). The IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message shall contain a single
cell, to which the UE/MS can be handed over. When the 3G_MSC‑A receives the
IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of handing over the
UE/MS to a BSS (BSS-B). The 3G_MSC‑A shall generate an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST
message to the selected BSS (BSS-B). When BSS-B receives the A‑HANDOVER-
REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to allow the UE/MS to
access the radio resource of BSS-B, this is detailed in 3GPP TS 48.058 [6] and
in 3GPP TS 45.008 [4]. The switching of the radio resource through the
necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in 3GPP TS 24.008 [10] and 3GPP TS
08.08 [5].
Once resource allocation has been completed by BSS-B it shall return an
A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK. to 3G_MSC‑A. When this message is received by 3G_MSC‑A
it shall begin the process of instructing the UE/MS to tune to a new dedicated
radio resource. An IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND will be sent by the 3G_MSC‑A to
RNS-A. On receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND message RNS-A will send the
radio resource control message RRC-HANDOVER-COMMAND, containing a Handover
Reference number previously allocated by BSS-B, to the UE/MS. The UE/MS will
then access the new radio resource using the Handover Reference number
contained in the RI-HANDOVER-ACCESS message. The number will be checked by
BSS-B to ensure it is as expected and the correct UE/MS has been captured. If
this is the correct UE/MS then the BSS-B shall send an A-HANDOVER-DETECT to
3G_MSC‑A. When the UE/MS is successfully communicating with the BSS-B a RI-
HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the UE/MS to BSS-B. The BSS-B will
then send an A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message to 3G_MSC‑A.
NOTE: The A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK from BSS-B contains the complete radio
resource control message that shall be sent by RNS-A to the UE/MS in the RRC-
HANDOVER-COMMAND, 3G_MSC‑A transparently passes this radio interface message
onto RNS‑A.
After 3G_MSC‑A has received the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B it
shall begin to release the resources allocated on RNS-A. In figure 8 the
resource is released by using the IU-RELEASE-COMMAND sequence.
If a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-
FAILURE returned from BSS-B, then 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the handover to
BSS-B and send an IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE message to RNS-A.
If RNS-A has decided to cancel the handover, it sends IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL
message to 3G_MSC‑A. The 3G_MSC‑A will then terminate the handover towards
BSS-B (if initiated) and send IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL- ACKNOWLEDGE message to
RNS-A.
In all cases the existing connection to the UE/MS shall not be cleared except
in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE.
During the period that the UE/MS is not in communication with the network
3G_MSC‑A shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered
to the UE/MS once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC
handover from UMTS to GSM on 3G_MSC‑B then the messages shall be queued by
3G_MSC‑B.
#### 6.2.1.2 With multiple bearers (Optional functionality)
If 3G_MSC-A supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS
23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-A shall have the following functionality additionally to
the description in subclause 6.2.1.1.
Upon receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-A 3G_MSC-A shall select
one bearer to be handed over if the UE is engaged with multiple bearers. After
that, 3G_MSC-A generates an A-HO-REQUEST message for the selected bearer to
BSS-B.
When an A-HO-REQUEST-ACK is received from BSS-B, 3G_MSC-A sends IU-RELOCATION-
COMMAND, which indicates the bearers not to be handed over as bearers to be
released, to RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives A-HO-COMPLETE message from BSS-B, 3G_MSC-A shall
release calls via BSS-B, which has been carried by the bearers not to be
handed over, and then sends IU-RELEASE-COMMAND to RNS-A.
### 6.2.2 Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS Handover
The procedure for a successful Intra-3G_MSC handover is shown in figure 9. It
is assumed that selection of a candidate UE/MS has already taken place within
the BSC based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The exact algorithm, in
the BSC, for determining a candidate UE/MS is not addressed in the present
document. The procedures discussed do not make use of the Mobile Application
Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figures 4 and 6. The
procedure described in this clause covers case ii).
In case of subsequent handover the following applies. If 3G_MSC-B supports
location reporting at change of Service Area and if encapsulated BSSAP
signalling is used on the E-interface, 3G_MSC-B shall always initiate the
Location Reporting Control procedure at change of Service Area towards the
target RNS since no request for Location Reporting can be received from MSC-A.
In that case, the Location Reporting Control procedure shall be initiated by
3G_MSC-B after the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure has been executed
successfully.
The change of Service Area shall be reported to MSC-A within an A-HANDOVER-
PERFORMED message.
In the case of ongoing voice group calls, the handover does not take place
since voice group calls are not supported in UMTS.
Figure 9: Basic External Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS Handover Procedure
The successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the BSS (BSS-A),
currently supporting the UE, determines that the UE requires to be handed over
to UMTS it will send an A‑HANDOVER-REQUIRED message to the 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑A).
The A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message shall contain a single cell, to which the UE
can be handed over. When the 3G_MSC‑A receives the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message
it shall begin the process of handing over the UE to a new RNS (RNS-B). The
3G_MSC‑A shall generate an Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to the selected RNS
(RNS-B). For handover of a speech call to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-A shall
include a NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. When RNS-B
receives the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action
to allow the UE to access the radio resource of RNS-B, this is detailed in the
3GPP TS 25.300 series and the 3GPP TS 25.200 series of 3GPP Technical
Specifications. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary
terrestrial resources is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS
25.413 [11].
Once resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B, it shall return an Iu-
RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK. to 3G_MSC‑A. When this message is received by 3G_MSC‑A
it shall begin the process of instructing the UE to tune to a new dedicated
radio resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the 3G_MSC‑A to BSS-A.
On receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio
interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND. The UE will then access the new radio
resource. On detection of the UE, the RNS-B shall send an Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT
to 3G_MSC‑A. When the UE is successfully communicating with the RNS-B an RRC-
HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the UE to RNS-B. The RNS-B will then
send an Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message to 3G_MSC‑A.
NOTE: The Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK from RNS-B contains the complete RRC
message that shall be sent by BSS-A to the MS in the RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND,
3G_MSC‑A transparently passes this radio interface message onto BSS‑A.
After 3G_MSC‑A has received the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, it
shall begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 9 the
resource is released by using the A‑CLEAR-COMMAND sequence.
If a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example, A-HANDOVER-
FAILURE returned from BSS-A or Iu‑RELOCATION FAILURE returned from RNS-B, then
3G_MSC‑A will terminate the handover to RNS-B. Under these conditions 3G_MSC‑A
may optionally take one of a number of actions:
i) await the next A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message;
ii) send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A, if an A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has
not already been sent.
The exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or
after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.
In all cases the existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared except in
the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE.
During the period that the UE is not in communication with the network
3G_MSC‑A shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered
to the UE once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC GSM to
UMTS handover on 3G_MSC‑B then the messages shall be queued by 3G_MSC‑B.
### 6.2.3 Procedure for Intra-3G_MSC SRNS Relocation
The procedure for a successful Intra-3G_MSC SRNS Relocation is shown in
figures 10 and 11. For a successful Intra-3G_MSC Enhanced SRNS Relocation the
procedure is shown in figures 11a and 11b. SRNS Relocation and Enhanced SRNS
Relocation are used to relocate the serving RNS functionality from one RNS to
another. The procedures may or may not involve change of the radio resources
assigned for the corresponding UE. Whether or not the Relocation includes
change of radio resources assigned for the UE does not affect the SRNS
Relocation procedure or Enhanced SRNS Relocation procedure in the Core
Network.
In case of subsequent Intra-3G_MSC-B SRNS relocation or Intra-3G_MSC-B
Enhanced SRNS relocation the following applies:
\- If 3G_MSC-B has previously received an order to perform location reporting
at change of Service Area from 3G_MSC-A and if 3G_MSC-B also supports Location
Reporting Control, it shall issue the Iu-LOCATION-REPORTING-CONTROL message
towards the target RNS immediately after successful completion of relocation.
Upon receipt of Iu-LOCATION-REPORT, 3G_MSC-B shall forward it towards 3G_MSC-A
via E interface.
If 3G_MSC-B supports location reporting at change of Service Area and if
encapsulated BSSAP signalling is used on the E-interface, 3G_MSC-B shall
always initiate the Location Reporting Control procedure at change of Service
Area towards the target RNS, since no request for Location Reporting can be
received from MSC-A. In that case, if an SRNS relocation is used, the Location
Reporting Control procedure shall be initiated by 3G_MSC-B after the
Relocation Resource Allocation procedure has been executed successfully;
otherwise 3G_MSC-B shall initiate the Location Reporting Control procedure
when the completion of the Enhanced SRNS Relocation has been confirmed by the
target RNS. The change of Service Area shall be reported to MSC-A within an
A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.
It is assumed that selection of a candidate UE has already taken place within
RNS based upon the criteria presenting in clause 5. The exact algorithm, in
RNS, for determining a candidate UE is not addressed in the present document.
The procedure discussed does not make use of the Mobile Application Part
(MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figures 4 and 6. The procedure
described in this clause covers case ii).

Network)
#### 6.2.3.1 With no bearer or one bearer
##### 6.2.3.1.1 SRNS Relocation
The successful operation of the SRNS Relocation procedure is as follows. When
the Serving RNS (RNS-A) makes the decision to perform the SRNS Relocation
procedure it will send an IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message to the 3G_MSC
(3G_MSC‑A). The IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message shall contain the identifier of
the target RNS to which the Relocation is to be performed. When the 3G_MSC‑A
receives the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of
relocating the serving RNS functionality to the new RNS (RNS-B). The 3G_MSC‑A
shall generate an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to the selected RNS (RNS-B).
For the relocation of a speech call to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC‑A shall include
the NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST, if the Iu Selected codec
to be used after the relocation is different from the Iu Currently used codec.
When RNS-B receives the IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take the
necessary action to establish the new Iu transport bearers for each Radio
Access Bearer related to 3G_MSC‑A for the UE in question, this is detailed in
the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS 25.413 [11].
Once resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B it shall return an IU-
RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to 3G_MSC‑A. When this message is received by
3G_MSC‑A, and 3G_MSC‑A is ready for the move in Serving RNS functionality, it
shall indicate the completion of the preparation phase on the core network
side for the SRNS Relocation. An IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND message is sent by
3G_MSC‑A to RNS-A. RNS-A acts as follows:
i) if the procedure is a SRNS Relocation without change of radio resources,
which means that the Iur interface between RNS-A and RNS-B can be used for the
procedure, the RNS-A shall send IUR-SRNS-RELOCATION-COMMIT message to the
RNS-B to trigger the Relocation execution. See figure 10.
ii) if the procedure is a SRNS Relocation with change of radio resources,
which means that the Iur interface between RNS-A and RNS-B is not used for the
procedure, the RNS-A shall trigger the handover procedure on the air interface
by sending the RRC-HANDOVER-COMMAND to the UE. The UE will then access the new
radio resources. See figure 11.
> NOTE: The IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE from RNS-B may optionally
> contain a transparent container, which is transferred by 3G_MSC‑A to the
> RNS-A using the IU‑RELOCATION-COMMAND message.
When the relocation execution trigger is received, RNS-B shall then take the
necessary action to assume the role of Serving RNS and shall send an IU-
RELOCATION-DETECT message to 3G_MSC‑A. When the UE is successfully in
communication with the RNS-B, then RNS-B shall send an IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE
message to 3G_MSC‑A.
After 3G_MSC‑A has received the IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, it
shall begin to release the resources associated to the RNS-A. In figures 10
and 11, the resources are released by using the IU‑RELEASE‑COMMAND sequence.
If a failure occurs during the SRNS Relocation attempt, then 3G_MSC‑A will
terminate the relocation to RNS-B. For example, if IU-RELOCATION-FAILURE is
returned from RNS-B then 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and
send IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A. If IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL is
returned from RNS-A, then 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and
send IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL-ACKNOWLEDGE to RNS-A.
In all cases the existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared except in
the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE.
During the period that the UE is not in communication with the network,
3G_MSC‑A shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered
to the UE once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC SRNS
Relocation (with or without change of radio resources) on 3G_MSC‑B, then the
messages shall be queued by 3G_MSC‑B.
##### 6.2.3.1.2 Enhanced SRNS Relocation
The successful operation of the Enhanced SRNS Relocation procedure is as
follows. When the Serving RNS (RNS-A) makes the decision to perform the
Enhanced SRNS Relocation procedure it will send an IUR-ENHANCED- RELOCATION-
REQUEST message to the new RNS (RNS‑B). The IUR-ENHANCED RELOCATION-REQUEST
message shall contain the necessary information to set up a CS Radio Access
Bearer in RNS-B.
When RNS-B receives the IUR-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take
the necessary actions to establish the new Iu transport bearers for the Radio
Access Bearer related to 3G_MSC‑A for the UE in question, as described in
detail in the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS 25.413 [11], and the new
transport bearers for the Radio Access Bearer related to RNS-A. to enable data
forwarding. RNS-B shall initialize the Iu UP towards RNS A, if necessary.
Once resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B it shall return an IUR-
ENHANCED-RELOCATION-RESPONSE message to RNC-A. If the resources cannot be
allocated, RNS-B returns an IUR-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-FAILURE message to RNS-A,
and RNS-A terminates the procedure.
After transmission of the IUR-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-RESPONSE message RNS-B and
RNS-A act as follows:
i) If the procedure is an Enhanced SRNS Relocation without change of radio
resources, RNS-B shall send an IU-ENHANCED RELOCATION-COMPLETE-REQUEST message
to 3G_MSC‑A and start data fowarding towards RNS-A for UL data. After receipt
of the IUR-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-RESPONSE message RNS-A shall start data
forwarding towards RNS-B for DL data. See figure 11a.
ii) If the procedure is an Enhanced SRNS Relocation with change of radio
resources, when RNS-A receives the IUR-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-RESPONSE message,
it shall trigger the handover procedure on the air interface by sending the
RRC-HANDOVER-COMMAND to the UE and start data forwarding towards RNS-B for DL
data. The UE will then access the new radio resources. When the UE is
successfully in communication with the RNS-B, then RNS-B shall start data
forwarding towards RNS-A for UL data and send an IU-ENHANCED RELOCATION-
COMPLETE-REQUEST message to 3G_MSC‑A. See figure 11b.
After 3G_MSC‑A has received the IU-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-COMPLETE-REQUEST
message from RNS-B, it shall start to configure the necessary Iu resources for
the RNS-B and send the IU-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-COMPLETE-RESPONSE message to
RNS-B. If the necessary resources cannot be allocated or a failure occurs in
3G_MSC-A, it shall send an IU-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-COMPLETE-FAILURE message to
RNS-B.
After RNC-B has received the IU-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-COMPLETE-RESPONSE message,
it shall start to configure the Iu transport bearer for each Radio Access
Bearer between the MSC-A and RNC-B and perform Iu UP initialization, if
necessary. After the completion of the Iu UP initialization, RNS-B shall send
an IU-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-COMPLETE-CONFIRM message to 3G_MSC-A.
After 3G_MSC-A has received the IU-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-COMPLETE-CONFIRM
message from RNS-B, it shall begin to release the resources associated to the
RNS-A. In figures 11a and 11b, the resources are released by using the
IU‑RELEASE‑COMMAND sequence.
#### 6.2.3.2 With multiple bearers (Optional functionality)
If 3G_MSC-A supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS
23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-A shall have the following functionality additionally to
the description in subclause 6.2.3.1.
For SRNS Relocation, upon receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-A,
3G_MSC-A generates an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message, which may include
multiple bearers, to RNS-B.
When an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK is received from RNS-B, 3G_MSC-A sends IU-
RELOCATION-COMMAND, which indicates the bearers failed to set up in RNS-B as
bearers to be released, to RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives a IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, 3G_MSC-A
shall release the calls via RNS-B, which have been carried by the bearers
failed to set up in RNS-B, and then sends IU-RELEASE-COMMAND to RNS-A.
For Enhanced SRNS Relocation, RNC-A generates an IUR-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-
REQUEST message, which may include multiple bearers, to RNS-B. If resources
for at least one bearer are reserved in RNS-B, RNS-B shall return an IUR-
ENHANCED-RELOCATION-RESPONSE message, which indicates the bearers failed to
set up in RNS-B as bearers to be released, to RNC-A.
When the UE is successfully in communication with the RNS-B, then RNS-B shall
send an IU-ENHANCED- RELOCATION-COMPLETE-REQUEST message, which indicates the
bearers failed to set up in RNS-B as bearers to be released, to 3G_MSC‑A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives the IU-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-COMPLETE-REQUEST message
from RNS-B, 3G_MSC-A shall release the calls via RNS-B, which have been
carried by the bearers failed to set up in RNS-B, and then sends IU-RELEASE-
COMMAND to RNS-A.
## 6.3 Internal Handover with MSC Support for Intra-BSS handover with AoIP
### 6.3.1 General Description of Internal Handover with MSC Support
If the A-Interface User Plane is carried over IP (or shall be handed over to
IP) and one or more of the A-Interface User Plane parameters need to be
modified, for example the Codec Type, or the Codec Configuration (BSS
determines that no compatible Codec Type or Codec Configuration exists for the
target cell), or the IP Transport Layer Address, or the UDP Port, or the
CSData Redundancy Level, or the A-Interface Type itself (e.g. from TDM to IP
or vice versa), then a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC support\" shall be
performed (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] subclause 3.1.5c.1).
The \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC support\" for AoIP is performed by the
MSC that is currently serving the connected BSS (in the following just termed
\"serving MSC\"); it may be either MSC-A, MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A or 3G_MSC-B.
NOTE: The \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC support\" involves the serving MSC
actively in the handover. It is therefore in average slower and more resource
demanding than the BSS Internal Handover without MSC support. In order to
guarantee a high radio network performance the MSC needs to react quickly and
handle this handover with high priority.
The \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC support\" applies only if both BSS and
Core Network support the AoIP procedures and messages, and an A-Interface User
Plane connection has been established beforehand. The procedures and messages
for this \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC support\" are described in 3GPP TS
48.008 [5].
The \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" can be initiated either:
a) by the BSS, by sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message; or:
b) by the serving MSC, by sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-ENQUIRY message.
### 6.3.2 BSS-initiated Internal Handover with MSC Support
The BSS-initiated \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" starts with an
A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from the BSS to the serving MSC, for
further details see 3GPP TS 48.008 [5], subclause 3.1.5c. An example sequence
is shown in figure 6.3.2.1
{width="6.643055555555556in" height="3.2263888888888888in"}
Figure 6.3.2.1: BSS-Initiated Internal Handover Execution
The A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message contains a reason for the required
handover and the currently valid Codec List (BSS Supported). It shall also
contain an AoIP Transport Layer Address and UDP Port, if the BSS requires an
IP-based target User Plane. The Codec List (BSS supported) contains the key
requirements from the BSS, like target Codec Type(s), target Codec
Configuration(s) and target A-interface Type(s) (TDM and/or IP), and may
contain the required Redundancy Level for CSData, etc.
When sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message the BSS starts a timer
\"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) and it expects an answer from the serving MSC
within that timer period. If \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) expires before the
MSC has answered, then the BSS ignores any subsequent (late) answer from the
serving MSC after expiry of timer \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]). The BSS will
not send any new A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message [before]{.underline}
timer \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) has expired or before the Internal Handover
Preparation is terminated by other reasons.
When the serving MSC receives the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it
shall start timer T105 (see subclause 9.3A). The serving MSC shall not send
any answer to the BSS [after]{.underline} timer T105 has expired. Both timers
(\"T25\" -- 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and T105) shall be configured (by O&M) to
minimise the likelihood that the answer from serving MSC to BSS crosses with a
new or repeated A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from the BSS to the
serving MSC, i.e. the timer T105 shall always expire before \"T25\" (3GPP TS
48.008 [5]) expires.
If the serving MSC is able to fulfil the required \"BSS Internal Handover with
MSC Support\", then it shall generate and send an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND
message to the BSS and stop timer T105. This answer shall contain the exact
new A-Interface User Plane parameters, e.g. Codec Type, Codec Configuration,
A-Interface Type, either TDM Circuit Identity Code or IP Transport Layer
Address and UDP Port (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [5]). While T25 is still running the
BSS can either accept or reject the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND.
When the BSS receives the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message it takes the
necessary action to allow the MS to access the radio resource of the new cell
in BSS, this is detailed in 3GPP TS 48.058 [6] and in 3GPP TS 45.008 [4]. The
switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is
detailed in 3GPP TS 44.018 [28] and 3GPP TS 48.008 [5]. On receipt of the
A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message the BSS will send e.g. the radio interface
message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND, containing a Handover Reference number previously
allocated to the MS. The MS will then access the new radio resource using the
Handover Reference number contained in the RI-HANDOVER-ACCESS message. The
number will be checked by BSS to ensure it is as expected and the correct MS
has been captured.
As BSS and MS proceed with the handover the BSS may send an A-HANDOVER-DETECT
message to the serving MSC to enable fast User Plane switching on the Core
Network side. As soon as the MS and BSS have completed the handover the BSS
send an A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message to serving MSC. Both BSS and serving MSC
will then release the no longer needed BSS and Core Network resources.
If the serving MSC is unable to support the required Internal Handover due to
whatever reason then it shall send an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT
message to the BSS (if T105 has not expired already). The serving MSC shall
not send an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT message after an A-INTERNAL-
HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent to the BSS.
If a failure occurs during the handover attempt and the BSS sends an
A-HANDOVER-FAILURE message, then the serving MSC shall terminate the handover
and shall revert back to using the resources used before the handover attempt
was made.
The serving MSC shall supervise the \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\"
procedure after sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND using the same timer
(T102) as used for Intra-MSC handover, see subclauses 9.3 and 11.3.
In all cases the existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared, except in
the case of expiry of the timer T102 before receipt of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE.
Whilst the MS is not in communication with the Core Network (i.e. in the time
span between sending of A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND and the reception of
A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE or an A-HANDOVER FAILURE) the serving MSC shall queue all
appropriate messages towards the MS. All these messages shall be delivered to
the MS once the communication is resumed.
### 6.3.3 MSC-initiated BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support
During a call the MSC may request to modify the A-Interface User Plane, for
example to change the Codec Type or Codec Configuration on the A-Interface to
optimise end-to-end speech quality by avoiding transcoding.
The serving MSC may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" by
sending an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-ENQUIRY message to the BSS containing, within
the Speech Codec (MSC Chosen) IE, the serving MSC\'s preferred speech Codec
Type and Codec Configuration and A-Interface Type.
If accepted by the BSS, the BSS responds with an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED
message, as described in subclause 6.3.2, with reason \"Response to an
INTERNAL HANDOVER ENQUIRY\". Then the \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC
Support\" may start.
If the BSS does not accept the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-ENQUIRY message, then it
returns an A-HANDOVER-FAILURE message to the serving MSC.
# 7 General description of the procedures for inter - MSC handovers
The following clauses describe two options for the Basic and Subsequent
Handover procedures. The first, as described in subclauses 7.1 and 7.3
respectively, provides for a circuit connection between MSC‑A and MSC‑B. The
second, as described in subclauses 7.2 and 7.4 respectively, provides for a
Basic and Subsequent Handover without the provision of a circuit connection
between MSC‑A and MSC‑B.
In all the above mentioned clauses, the following principles apply:
a) during the handover resource allocation, except for the messages explicitly
indicated in b and c below, only the handover related messages that are part
of the applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - shall be
transferred on the E-interface;
b) the trace related messages that are part of the applicable BSSAP subset -
as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - can be sent by the MSC‑A on the E-interface
after successful handover resource allocation. In subclauses 7.1 and 7.2, it
is however allowed at basic handover initiation on the E-Interface to transfer
one trace related message that is part of the applicable BSSAP subset - as
defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - together with the applicable handover related
message. The applicable handover related message shall always appear as the
first message;
c) during the handover resource allocation for subsequent inter-MSC handover
according to subclauses 7.3 and 7.4, it is allowed to transfer either DTAP or
RANAP Direct Transfer messages on the E-Interface between MSC-A and MSC-B.
RANAP Direct Transfer messages shall be used for this purpose if and only if
the basic handover procedure was an inter MSC SRNS relocation;
d) during the handover execution, ie while the MS is not in communication with
the network, the MSC‑A shall queue all outgoing BSSAP or RANAP messages until
the communication with the MS is resumed;
e) during the execution of a basic inter-MSC handover to MSC-B or a subsequent
inter-MSC handover to a third MSC-B', only the handover related messages and
the A-Clear-Request message that are part of the applicable BSSAP subset - as
defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] -- may be sent by the target MSC on the
E-interface;
f) during a subsequent inter-MSC handover back to MSC-A or to a third MSC-B',
MSC-B may initiate either an Iu-Release-Request procedure or an A-Clear-
Request procedure on the E-interface. An Iu-Release-Request procedure shall be
initiated only if the basic handover procedure was an inter-MSC SRNS
relocation;
g) finally, during supervision, ie while the MS is not in the area of MSC‑A
after a successful Inter-MSC handover, the subset of BSSAP procedures and
their related messages - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - shall apply on the
E‑Interface. As the only exception to this rule, in case of a subsequent
inter-MSC SRNS relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third 3G_MSC-B', during the
relocation resource allocation, the relocation and trace related messages that
are part of the applicable RANAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 29.108 [15] -
shall be transferred on the E-interface (see subclause 8.3, a and b).
> If a subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third
> 3G_MSC-B' is cancelled, then the supervision continues, and BSSAP procedures
> and their related messages shall apply on the E-interface.
NOTE: A subsequent inter-MSC SRNS relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third
3G_MSC-B' can occur, e.g., if after the basic inter-MSC handover to 3G_MSC-B
the MS performed a subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B GSM to UMTS inter-system
handover;
h) during the intra-MSC‑B handover execution, if any, the MSC‑B shall queue
all outgoing BSSAP messages until the communication with the MS is resumed.
## 7.1 Basic handover procedure requiring a circuit connection between MSC‑A
and MSC‑B
The procedure used for successful Inter-MSC Handover is shown in figure 12.
Initiation of the handover procedure is described in clause 5. The procedure
described in this clause makes use of messages from the 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and
of the transport mechanism from the Mobile Application Part (MAP) (3GPP TS
29.002 [12]). After an Inter-MSC handover further Intra-MSC handovers may
occur on MSC‑B, these handovers will follow the procedures specified in the
previous clause.
NOTE 1: Can be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.
Figure 12: Basic Handover Procedure requiring a circuit connection
The handover is initiated as described in subclause 6.1. (This is represented
by A-HO-REQUIRED in figure 12. Upon receipt of the A-HO-REQUIRED from BSS-A,
MSC‑A shall send a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to MSC‑B including a complete
A-HO-REQUEST message.
NOTE: MSC‑A shall not send further MAP‑PREPARE‑HANDOVER requests while a MAP-
PREPARE-HANDOVER response is pending or before any timeouts.
The MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall carry in the A‑HO-REQUEST all
information needed by MSC‑B for allocating a radio channel, see 3GPP TS 48.008
[5]. For compatibility reasons, the MAP‑PREPARE-HANDOVER request will also
identify the cell to which the call is to be handed over. For speech calls,
MSC-A shall also include the Iu Supported Codecs List to be used by MSC-B for
subsequent intra-MSC-B intersystem handover to UMTS and intra-MSC-B SRNS
relocation. MSC‑B will return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having
retrieved a Handover Number from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages
MAP-allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request).
The Handover Number shall be used for routing the connection of the call from
MSC‑A to MSC‑B. If a traffic channel is available in MSC‑B the MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER response, sent to MSC‑A will contain the complete A‑HO‑REQUEST-
ACKNOWLEDGE message received from BSS-B, containing the radio resources
definition to be sent by BSS-A to the MS and possible extra BSSMAP
information, amended by MSC‑B due to the possible interworking between the
BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the
A‑interface. If the traffic channel allocation is queued by BSS-B, the
A-QUEUING-INDICATION may optionaly be sent back to MSC‑A. The further traffic
channel allocation result (A-HO-REQUEST-ACK or A-HO-FAILURE) will be
transferred to MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. If the
traffic channel allocation is not possible, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response
containing an A-HO-FAILURE will be sent to MSC‑A. MSC‑B will do the same if a
fault is detected on the identity of the cell where the call has to be handed
over. MSC‑B simply reports the events related to the dialogue. It is up to
MSC‑A to decide the action to perform if it receives negative responses or the
operation fails due to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER timer.
If A interface over IP is supported then for speech calls the selection of the
speech codec shall be as described in 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and if no transcoder
is inserted in the BSS then MSC-B shall insert a transcoder.
If an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
request is returned from MSC‑B, this will be indicated to MSC‑A and MSC‑A will
terminate the handover attempt. MSC‑A may retry the handover attempt using the
cell identity list, if provided, or may reject the handover attempt towards
BSS-A. The existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared.
When the A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE has been received, MSC‑A shall establish a
circuit between MSC‑A and MSC‑B by signalling procedures supported by the
network. In figure 12 this is illustrated by the messages IAM (Initial Address
Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling System no 7. MSC‑B
awaits the capturing of the MS (subclause 6.1) on the radio path when the ACM
is sent and MSC‑A initiates the handover execution when ACM is received
(illustrated by the A-HO-COMMAND and described in the subclause 6.1.
If the BSS-A was connected via an A interface over IP and no transcoding
performed in the BSS then MSC-A shall remove the transcoder between the MSC
and the other party.
MSC‑B transfers to MSC‑A the acknowledgement received from the correct MS
(A-HO-DETECT/A-HO-COMPLETE). The A-HO-DETECT, if received, is transferred to
MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The A-HO-COMPLETE, when
received from the correct MS, is included in the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request
and sent back to MSC‑A. The circuit is through-connected in MSC‑A when the
A-HO-DETECT or the A-HO-COMPLETE is received from MSC‑B. The old radio channel
is released when the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received from MSC‑B. The sending
of the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request starts the MAP supervision timer for the
MAP dialogue between MSC‑A and MSC‑B. When the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request
including the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received in MSC‑A the resources in
BSS-A shall be cleared.
In order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between
MSC‑A and MSC‑B, MSC‑B must generate an answer signal when A-HO-
DETECT/COMPLETE is received.
MSC‑B shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between MSC‑A and
MSC‑B has been established.
If the circuit between MSC‑A and MSC‑B cannot be established (e.g. an
unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM). MSC‑A terminates
the inter-MSC handover attempt by sending an appropriate MAP message, for
example an ABORT. MSC‑A may retry the handover at this point, see subclause
6.1.
MSC‑A shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the fixed
subscriber or the MS and there is no further call control functions to be
performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).
When MSC‑A clears the call to the MS it also clears the call control functions
in MSC‑A and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the MAP
resources in MSC‑B.
MSC‑A may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP
message to MSC‑B. If establishment of the circuit between MSC‑A and MSC‑B has
been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.
The handover will be aborted by MSC‑A if it detects clearing or interruption
of the radio path before the call has been established on MSC‑B.
## 7.2 Basic handover procedure not requiring the establishment of a circuit
connection between MSC‑A and MSC‑B
The basic handover procedures to be used when no circuit connection is
required by MSC‑A are similar to those described in subclause 7.1 for circuit
switched calls. The main differences to the procedures described in subclause
7.1 relate to the establishment of circuits between the network entities and
the Handover Number allocation.
In the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls the circuit connections are
already established therefore the procedures described in this clause are also
applicable. When applied to ongoing voice group calls the clearing of
resources on BSS-A shall not be used if the resources are still be used on the
down link. Consequently the A-CLEAR-COMMAND message shall not be sent, but an
HANDOVER-SUCCEEDED message shall be sent.
In the case of basic handover, MSC‑A shall specify to MSC‑B that no Handover
Number is required in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request (see 3GPP TS 29.002
[12]). As for the basic handover using a circuit connection, the A-HO-REQUEST
is transmitted at the same time. Any subsequent Handover Number allocation
procedure will not be invoked until the completion of the basic handover
procedure (see clause: Subsequent Channel Assignment using a circuit
connection). MSC‑B shall then perform the radio resources allocation as
described in subclause 7.1. The MAP‑PREPARE-HANDOVER response shall be
returned to MSC‑A including either the response of the radio resources
allocation request received from BSS-B (A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE/A-HO-FAILURE
with possible extra BSSMAP information. These extra information are amended by
MSC‑B due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on
the E-interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the A-interface) or
potentially the A-QUEUING-INDICATION . The basic handover procedure will
continue as described in subclause 7.1 except that no circuit connection will
be established towards MSC‑B.
The relevant case for the basic handover without circuit connection is shown
in figure 13. As can be seen the major differences to the equivalent figure 12
is the omission of any circuit establishment messaging and the omission of
handover number allocation signalling.
Figure 13: Basic Handover Procedure without circuit connection
## 7.3 Procedure for subsequent handover requiring a circuit connection
After the call has been handed over to MSC‑B, if the MS leaves the area of
MSC‑B during the same call, subsequent handover is necessary in order to
continue the connection.
The following cases apply:
i) the MS moves back to the area of MSC‑A;
ii) the MS moves into the area of a third MSC (MSC‑B\').
In both cases the call is switched in MSC‑A; the circuit between MSC‑A and
MSC‑B shall be released after a successful subsequent handover has been
performed.
### 7.3.1 Description of subsequent handover procedure i): MSC‑B to MSC‑A
The procedure for successful handover from MSC‑B back to MSC‑A is shown in
figure 14.
Figure 14: Subsequent handover procedure i):successful handover\ from MSC‑B to
MSC‑A using a circuit connection
The procedure is as follows.
MSC‑B sends the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request to MSC‑A indicating
the new MSC number(MSC‑A number), indicating also the identity of the cell
where the call has to be handed over and including a complete A-HO-REQUEST
message. (NOTE: MSC‑B shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER
requests while a handover attempt is pending or before any timeouts). Since
MSC‑A is the call controlling MSC, this MSC needs no Handover Number for
routing purposes; MSC‑A can immediately initiate the search for a free radio
channel.
When a radio channel can be assigned, MSC‑A shall return in the MAP-PREPARE-
SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE message
received from the BSS-B and possible extra BSSMAP information, amended by
MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on
the E-interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the A-interface. If the
traffic channel allocation is queued by BSS-B, the A-QUEUING-INDICATION may
optionaly be sent back to MSC‑B. The further traffic channel allocation result
(A-HO-REQUEST-ACK or A-HO-FAILURE) will be transferred to MSC‑B using the MAP-
FORWARD-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request.If a radio channel cannot be assigned or if
a fault is detected on the target cell identity, or the target cell identity
in the A-HO-REQUEST is not consistent with the target MSC number, the MAP-
PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-FAILURE message shall
be given to MSC‑B, in addition MSC‑B shall maintain the connection with the
MS.
If the procedure in MSC‑A is successful then MSC‑B can request the MS to
retune to the new BSS-B on MSC‑A. This is illustrated in figure 14 by the
A-HO-COMMAND message. The operation is successfully completed when MSC‑A
receives the A-HO-COMPLETE message.
After handover MSC‑A shall release the circuit to MSC‑B.
MSC‑A must also terminate the MAP procedure for the basic handover between
MSC‑A and MSC‑B by sending an appropriate MAP message. MSC‑B will clear the
resources in BSS-A when the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response is received.
### 7.3.2 Description of the subsequent handover procedure ii): MSC‑B to
MSC‑B\'
The procedure for successful handover from MSC‑B to MSC‑B\' is shown in figure
15.
The procedure consists of two parts:
\- a subsequent handover from MSC‑B back to MSC‑A as described in subclause
7.3.1 (the same procedures apply if MSC-A is replaced by 3G_MSC-A); and
\- a basic handover from MSC‑A to MSC‑B\' as described in subclause 7.1.
MSC‑B sends the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request to MSC‑A indicating a
new MSC number (which is the identity of MSC‑B\'), indicating also the target
cell identity and including a complete A-HO-REQUEST, MSC‑A then starts a basic
handover procedure towards MSC‑B\'.
When MSC‑A receives the ACM from MSC‑B\', MSC‑A informs MSC‑B that MSC‑B\' has
successfuly allocated the radio resources on BSS-B\' side by sending the MAP-
PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing the complete A-HO-REQUEST-
ACKNOWLEDGE received from BSS-B\'and possible extra BSSMAP information,
amended by MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol
carried on the E-interface between MSC‑A and MSC‑B\' and the BSSMAP protocol
carried on the E-interface between MSC‑A and MSC‑B. Now MSC‑B can start the
procedure on the radio path.
For MSC‑A the handover is completed when it has received the MAP-SEND-END-
SIGNAL REQUEST from MSC‑B\'containing the A-HO-COMPLETE received from the
BSS-B\'. The circuit between MSC‑A and MSC‑B is released. MSC‑A also sends the
MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to MSC‑B in order to terminate the original MAP
dialogue between MSC‑A and MSC‑B. MSC‑B releases the radio resources when it
receives this message.
If the traffic channel allocation is queued by the BSS-B\', the A-QUEUING-
INDICATION may optionaly be sent back to MSC‑B. If no radio channel can be
allocated by MSC‑B\' or no circuit between MSC‑A and MSC‑B\' can be
established or a fault is detected on the target cell identity or the target
cell identity in the A-HO-REQUEST is not consistent with the target MSC
number, MSC‑A informs MSC‑B by using the A-HO-FAILURE message included in the
MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response. MSC‑B shall maintain the existing
connection with the MS.
When the subsequent handover is completed, MSC‑B\' is considered as MSC‑B. Any
further inter-MSC handover is handled as described above for a subsequent
handover.
NOTE 1: Can be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.
Figure 15: Subsequent handover procedure ii): Successful handover\ from MSC‑B
to MSC‑B\'requiring a circuit connection
## 7.4 Procedure for subsequent handover not requiring a circuit connection
As for the subsequent handover with a circuit connection, the same two cases
of subsequent handover apply:
i) the MS moves back to the area of MSC‑A;
ii) the MS moves into the area of a third MSC (MSC‑B\').
### 7.4.1 Description of the subsequent handover procedure without circuit
connection i): MSC‑B to MSC‑A
The procedure for successful handover from MSC‑B back to MSC‑A without circuit
connection is shown in figure 16. The only difference with the figure 14, is
that no circuit release is needed between MSC‑A and MSC‑B.
Figure 16: Subsequent handover procedure i): Successful handover\ from MSC‑B
to MSC‑A not requiring a circuit connection
### 7.4.2 Description of the subsequent handover procedure without circuit
connection ii): MSC‑B to MSC‑B\'
The procedure for successful handover from MSC‑B to MSC‑B\' is shown in figure
17.
The procedure consists of two parts:
\- a subsequent handover from MSC‑B back to MSC‑A as described in subclause
7.4.1(the same procedures apply if MSC-A is replaced by 3G_MSC-A); and
\- a basic handover from MSC‑A to MSC‑B\' as described in subclause 7.2.
The only difference to the equivalent figure 15 is the omission of the circuit
and handover number allocation signallings.

# 8 General Description of the procedures for inter - 3G_MSC handovers
## 8.1 Handover UMTS to GSM
The following clauses describe two options for the Basic and Subsequent UMTS
to GSM Handover procedures. The first, as described in subclauses 8.1.1 and
8.1.3 respectively, provides for a circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and
3G_MSC‑B. The second, as described in subclauses 8.1.2 and 8.1.4 respectively,
provides for a Basic and Subsequent Handover without the provision of a
circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. 3G_MSC can also be a pure
GSM MSC.
In all the above mentioned clauses, the following principles apply:
a) during the handover resource allocation, except for the messages explicitly
indicated in b and c below, only the handover related messages that are part
of the applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - shall be
transferred on the E-interface;
b) the trace related messages that are part of the applicable BSSAP subset -
as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7]- can be sent by the 3G_MSC‑A on the
E-interface after successful handover resource allocation. In the subclauses
8.1.1 and 8.1.2, it is however allowed at basic handover initiation on the
E-Interface to transfer one trace related message that is part of the
applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - together with the
applicable handover related message. The applicable handover related message
shall always appear as the first message;
c) during the handover resource allocation for subsequent inter-MSC inter-
system handover according to subclauses 8.1.3 and 8.1.4, it is allowed to
transfer either DTAP or RANAP Direct Transfer messages on the E-Interface
between 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B. RANAP Direct Transfer messages shall be used
for this purpose if and only if the basic handover procedure was an inter MSC
SRNS relocation;
d) during the handover execution, i.e. while the UE/MS is not in communication
with the network, the 3G_MSC‑A shall queue all outgoing BSSAP or RANAP
messages until the communication with the UE/MS is resumed;
> e) during the execution of a basic inter-system inter-MSC handover to MSC-B
> or a subsequent inter-system inter-MSC handover to a third MSC-B', only the
> handover related messages and the A-Clear-Request message that are part of
> the applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] -- may be
> sent by the target MSC on the E-interface;
f) during a subsequent inter-system inter-MSC handover back to 3G_MSC-A or to
a third MSC-B', 3G_MSC-B may initiate either an Iu-Release-Request procedure
or an A-Clear-Request procedure on the E-interface. An Iu-Release-Request
procedure shall be initiated only if the basic handover procedure was an
inter-MSC SRNS relocation;
g) finally, during supervision, i.e. while the UE/MS is not in the area of
3G_MSC‑A after a successful Inter-3G_MSC handover, the subset of BSSAP
procedures and their related messages - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] -
shall apply on the E-Interface. As the only exception to this rule, in case of
a subsequent inter-MSC SRNS relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third
3G_MSC-B', during the relocation resource allocation, the relocation and trace
related messages that are part of the applicable RANAP subset - as defined in
3GPP TS 29.108 [15] - shall be transferred on the E-interface (see subclause
8.3, a and b).
> If a subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third
> 3G_MSC-B' is cancelled, then the supervision continues, and BSSAP procedures
> and their related messages shall apply on the E-interface.
NOTE: A subsequent inter-MSC SRNS relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third
3G_MSC-B' can occur, e.g., if after the basic inter-MSC handover to 3G_MSC-B
the MS performed a subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B GSM to UMTS inter-system
handover;
h) during the intra-3G_MSC -B handover execution, if any, the 3G_MSC -B shall
queue all outgoing BSSAP or RANAP messages until the communication with the
UE/MS is resumed.
### 8.1.1 Basic Handover procedure requiring a circuit connection between
3G_MSC -A and MSC‑B
The procedure used for successful Inter-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM Handover is shown
in figure 18. Initiation of the UMTS to GSM handover procedure is described in
clause 5. The procedure described in this clause makes use of messages from
the 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] and of the transport mechanism from the Mobile
Application Part (MAP) (3GPP TS 29.002 [12]). After an Inter-3G_MSC
relocation/handover, Intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover may occur on 3G_MSC -B,
this handover will follow the procedures specified in a previous clause.
NOTE 1: Can be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.
Figure 18: Basic UMTS to GSM Handover Procedure requiring a circuit connection
#### 8.1.1.1 With one circuit connection
The UMTS to GSM handover is initiated as described in subclause 6.2.1. (This
is represented by Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED in figure 18). Upon receipt of the
Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-A, 3G_MSC‑A shall send a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
request to MSC‑B including a complete A-HO-REQUEST message.
NOTE: 3G_MSC‑A shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER requests while a
MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response is pending or before any timeouts.
The MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall carry in the A‑HO-REQUEST all
information needed by MSC‑B for allocating a radio channel, see 3GPP TS 08.08.
For compatibility reasons, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request will also identify
the cell to which the call is to be handed over. For speech calls, 3G_MSC-A
shall also include the Iu Supported Codecs List to be used by MSC-B for
subsequent intra-MSC-B intersystem handover to UMTS and intra-MSC-B SRNS
relocation. MSC‑B will return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having
retrieved a Handover Number from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages
MAP-allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request).
The Handover Number shall be used for routing the connection of the call from
3G_MSC‑A to MSC‑B. If a traffic channel is available in MSC‑B the MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER response, sent to 3G_MSC‑A will contain the complete A-HO-REQUEST-
ACKNOWLEDGE message received from BSS-B, containing the radio resources
definition to be sent by RNS-A to the UE/MS and possible extra BSSMAP
information, amended by MSC‑B due to the possible interworking between the
BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the
A-interface. If the traffic channel allocation is queued by BSS-B, the
A-QUEUING-INDICATION may optionally be sent back to 3G_MSC‑A. The further
traffic channel allocation result (A-HO-REQUEST-ACK or A-HO-FAILURE) will be
transferred to 3G_MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. If
the traffic channel allocation is not possible, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
response containing an A-HO-FAILURE will be sent to 3G_MSC‑A. MSC‑B will do
the same if a fault is detected on the identity of the cell where the call has
to be handed over. MSC‑B simply reports the events related to the dialogue. It
is up to 3G_MSC‑A to decide the action to perform if it receives negative
responses or the operation fails due to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
timer.
If A interface over IP is supported then for speech calls the selection of the
speech codec shall be as described in 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and if no transcoder
is inserted in the BSS then MSC-B shall insert a transcoder.
If an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
request is returned from MSC‑B, this will be indicated to 3G_MSC‑A and
3G_MSC‑A will terminate the handover attempt. 3G_MSC‑A rejects the handover
attempt towards RNS-A. The existing connection to the UE/MS shall not be
cleared.
When the A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE has been received, 3G_MSC‑A shall establish
a circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B by signalling procedures supported by the
network. In figure 18 this is illustrated by the messages IAM (Initial Address
Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling System no 7. MSC‑B
awaits the capturing of the UE/MS (subclause 6.2.1) on the radio path when the
ACM is sent and 3G_MSC‑A initiates the UMTS to GSM handover execution when ACM
is received (illustrated by the Iu-RELOCATION-COMMAND and described in
subclause 6.2.1). 3G_MSC‑A removes the transcoder from the path to the other
party.
MSC‑B transfers to 3G_MSC‑A the acknowledgement received from the correct
UE/MS (A-HO-DETECT/A-HO-COMPLETE). The A-HO-DETECT, if received, is
transferred to 3G_MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The
A-HO-COMPLETE, when received from the correct UE/MS, is included in the MAP-
SEND-END-SIGNAL request and sent back to 3G_MSC‑A. The circuit is through
connected in 3G_MSC‑A when the A-HO-DETECT or the A-HO-COMPLETE is received
from MSC‑B. The old radio channel is released when the A-HO-COMPLETE message
is received from MSC‑B. The sending of the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request starts
the MAP supervision timer for the MAP dialogue between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B.
When the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request including the A-HO-COMPLETE message is
received in 3G_MSC‑A, the resources in RNS-A shall be cleared.
In order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between
3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B, MSC‑B must generate an answer signal when A-HO-
DETECT/COMPLETE is received.
MSC‑B shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and
MSC‑B has been established.
If the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B cannot be established, (e.g. an
unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM), 3G_MSC‑A terminates
the inter-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover attempt by sending an appropriate MAP
message, for example an ABORT.
3G_MSC‑A shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the
fixed subscriber or the UE/MS and there is no further call control functions
to be performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).
When 3G_MSC‑A clears the call to the UE/MS it also clears the call control
functions in 3G_MSC‑A and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release
the MAP resources in MSC‑B.
3G_MSC‑A may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP
message to MSC‑B. If establishment of the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B
has been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.
The UMTS to GSM handover will be aborted by 3G_MSC‑A if it detects clearing or
interruption of the radio path before the call has been established on MSC‑B.
#### 8.1.1.2 With multiple circuit connections (Optional functionality)
If 3G_MSC-A supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS
23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-A shall have the following functionality additionally to
the description in subclause 8.1.1.1.
Upon receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-A 3G_MSC-A shall select
one bearer to be handed over if the UE is engaged with multiple bearers. After
that, the 3G_MSC-A generates an A-HO-REQUEST message for the selected bearer
and sends it to MSC-B over MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.
When MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response including an A-HO-REQUEST-ACK is received
from MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A sends IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND, which indicates the bearers
not to be handed over as bearers to be released, to RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request from MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A shall
release calls via MSC-B, which has been carried by the bearers not to be
handed over, and then 3G_MSC-A sends IU-RELEASE-COMMAND to RNS-A.
### 8.1.2 Basic UMTS to GSM Handover procedure not requiring the establishment
of a circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B
The basic UMTS to GSM handover procedures to be used when no circuit
connection is required by 3G_MSC‑A are similar to those described in clause
8.1.1 for circuit switched calls. The main differences to the procedures
described in clause 8.1.1 relate to the establishment of circuits between the
network entities and the Handover Number allocation.
In the case of basic UMTS to GSM handover, 3G_MSC‑A shall specify to MSC‑B
that no Handover Number is required in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request (see
3GPP TS 29.002 [12]). As for the basic UMTS to GSM handover using a circuit
connection, the A-HO-REQUEST is transmitted at the same time. Any subsequent
Handover Number allocation procedure will not be invoked until the completion
of the basic UMTS to GSM handover procedure (see clause: Subsequent Channel
Assignment using a circuit connection). MSC‑B shall then perform the radio
resources allocation as described in subclause 8.1.1. The MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
response shall be returned to 3G_MSC‑A including either the response of the
radio resources allocation request received from BSS-B (A‑HO-REQUEST-
ACKNOWLEDGE/A-HO-FAILURE with possible extra BSSMAP information. These extra
information are amended by MSC‑B due to the possible interworking between the
BSSMAP protocol carried on the E‑interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the
A-interface) or potentially the A-QUEUING-INDICATION. The basic UMTS to GSM
handover procedure will continue as described in subclause 8.1.1 except that
no circuit connection will be established towards MSC‑B.
The relevant case for the basic UMTS to GSM handover without circuit
connection is shown in figure 19. As can be seen the major differences to the
equivalent figure 18 is the omission of any circuit establishment messaging
and the omission of handover number allocation signalling.
Figure 19: Basic UMTS to GSM Handover Procedure without circuit connection
### 8.1.3 Procedure for subsequent UMTS to GSM handover requiring a circuit
connection
After the call has been handed over to 3G_MSC‑B, if the UE/MS leaves the area
of 3G_MSC‑B during the same call and enters a GSM area, subsequent UMTS to GSM
handover is necessary in order to continue the connection.
The following cases apply:
i) the UE/MS moves back to the area of MSC‑A;
ii) the UE/MS moves into the area of a third MSC (MSC‑B\').
In both cases the call is switched in 3G_MSC‑A; the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A
and MSC‑B shall be released after a successful subsequent handover has been
performed the same procedures apply if 3G_MSC-A is replaced by MSC-A.
#### 8.1.3.1 Description of subsequent UMTS to GSM handover procedure i):
3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑A
The procedure for successful UMTS to GSM handover from MSC‑B back to 3G_MSC‑A
is shown in figure 20.
Figure 20: Subsequent UMTS to GSM handover procedure i): successful UMTS\ to
GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑A using a circuit connection
##### 8.1.3.1.1 With one circuit connection
The procedure is as follows.
3G_MSC‑B sends the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request to MSC‑A indicating
the new MSC number (MSC‑A number), indicating also the identity of the cell
where the call has to be handed over and including a complete A-HO-REQUEST
message. (NOTE: 3G_MSC‑B shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-
HANDOVER requests while a handover attempt is pending or before any timeouts).
Since MSC‑A is the call controlling MSC, this MSC needs no Handover Number for
routing purposes; MSC‑A can immediately initiate the search for a free radio
channel.
When a radio channel can be assigned, MSC‑A shall return in the MAP-PREPARE-
SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE message
received from the BSS-B and possible extra BSSMAP information, amended by
MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on
the E-interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the A-interface. If the
traffic channel allocation is queued by BSS-B, the A-QUEUING-INDICATION may
optionally be sent back to 3G_MSC‑B. The further traffic channel allocation
result (A-HO-REQUEST-ACK or A-HO-FAILURE) will be transferred to 3G_MSC‑B
using the MAP-FORWARD-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. If a radio channel cannot be
assigned or if a fault is detected on the target cell identity, or the target
cell identity in the A-HO-REQUEST is not consistent with the target MSC
number, the MAP‑PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-
FAILURE message shall be given to 3G_MSC‑B, in addition 3G_MSC‑B shall
maintain the connection with the UE/MS.
If the procedure in MSC‑A is successful then 3G_MSC‑B can request the UE/MS to
retune to the new BSS-B on MSC‑A. This is illustrated in figure 20 by the Iu-
RELOCATION-COMMAND message. The operation is successfully completed when MSC‑A
receives the A-HO-COMPLETE message.
After UMTS to GSM handover MSC‑A shall release the circuit to 3G_MSC‑B.
MSC‑A must also terminate the MAP procedure for the basic UMTS to GSM handover
between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B by sending an appropriate MAP message. 3G_MSC‑B
will clear the resources in RNS-A when the MAP‑SEND-END-SIGNAL response is
received.
##### 8.1.3.1.2 With multiple circuit connections (Optional functionality)
If 3G_MSC-B supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS
23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-B shall have the following functionality additionally to
the description in subclause 8.1.3.1.1.
Upon receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-A which indicates the
target is BSS, 3G_MSC-B shall select one bearer to be handed over if the UE is
engaged with multiple bearers. After that, the 3G_MSC-B generates an A-HO-
REQUEST message for the selected bearer and sends it to 3G_MSC-A over MAP-
PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request with indication of RAB ID of the selected
bearer.
When MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response including an A-HO-REQUEST-ACK is
received from the 3G_MSC-A, 3G_MSC-B sends IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND, which
indicates the bearers not to be handed over as bearers to be released, to
RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives A-HO-COMPLETE message from BSS-B, 3G_MSC-A shall
release calls via BSS-B, which has been carried by the bearers not to be
handed over, and then 3G_MSC-A sends MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to 3G_MSC-B.
#### 8.1.3.2 Description of subsequent UMTS to GSM handover procedure ii):
3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑B\'
The procedure for successful UMTS to GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑B\' is
shown in figure 21.
The procedure consists of two parts:
\- a subsequent UMTS to GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B back to 3G_MSC‑A as
described in subclause 8.1.3.1 (the same procedures apply if 3G_MSC-A is
replaced by MSC-A); and
\- a basic handover from 3G_MSC‑A to MSC‑B\' as described in subclause 7.1.
#### 8.1.3.2.1 With one circuit connection
3G_MSC‑B sends the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSC‑A
indicating a new MSC number (which is the identity of MSC‑B\'), indicating
also the target cell identity and including a complete A‑HO‑REQUEST, 3G_MSC‑A
then starts a basic handover procedure towards MSC‑B\'.
When 3G_MSC‑A receives the ACM from MSC‑B\', 3G_MSC‑A informs 3G_MSC‑B that
MSC‑B\' has successfully allocated the radio resources on BSS-B\' side by
sending the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing the complete
A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE received from BSS-B\' and possible extra BSSMAP
information, amended by 3G_MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the
BSSMAP protocol carried on the E‑interface between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B\' and
the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B.
Now 3G_MSC‑B can start the procedure on the radio path.
For 3G_MSC‑A the UMTS to GSM handover is completed when it has received the
MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL REQUEST from MSC‑B\' containing the A-HO-COMPLETE received
from the BSS-B\'. The circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B is released.
3G_MSC‑A also sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to 3G_MSC‑B in order to
terminate the original MAP dialogue between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. 3G_MSC‑B
releases the radio resources when it receives this message.
If the traffic channel allocation is queued by the BSS-B\', the A-QUEUING-
INDICATION may optionally be sent back to 3G_MSC‑B. If no radio channel can be
allocated by MSC‑B\' or no circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B\' can be
established or a fault is detected on the target cell identity or the target
cell identity in the A-HO-REQUEST is not consistent with the target MSC
number, 3G_MSC‑A informs 3G_MSC‑B by using the A-HO-FAILURE message included
in the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response. 3G_MSC‑B shall maintain the
existing connection with the UE/MS.
When the subsequent UMTS to GSM handover is completed, MSC‑B\' is considered
as MSC‑B. Any further inter-MSC handover is handled as described earlier for a
subsequent handover.
##### 8.1.3.2.2 With multiple circuit connections (Optional functionality)
If 3G_MSC-B supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS
23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-B shall have the following functionality additionally to
the description in subclause 8.1.3.2.1.
Upon receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-B 3G_MSC-B shall select
one bearer to be handed over if the UE is engaged with multiple bearers. After
that, the 3G_MSC-B generates an A-HO-REQUEST message for the selected bearer
and sends it to 3G_MSC-A over MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request with
indication of RAB ID of the selected bearer.
Upon receipt of the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request from 3G_MSC-B,
3G_MSC-A starts a basic handover procedure towards MSC-B\'.
When 3G_MSC-A receives the ACM from MSC-B\', 3G_MSC-A informs 3G_MSC-B that
MSC-B\' has successfully allocated the radio resources on BSS-B\' side by
sending the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing the complete
A-HO-REQUEST-ACK received from BSS-B\' and possible extra BSSAP information,
amended by 3G_MSC-A due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP
protocol carried on the E-interface between 3G_MSC-A and MSC-B\' and the
BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface between 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B.
When MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response including an A-HO-REQUEST-ACK is
received from 3G_MSC-A, 3G_MSC-B sends IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND, which indicates
the bearers not to be handed over as bearers to be released, to RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request from MSC-B\', 3G_MSC-A
shall release calls via MSC-B\', which has been carried by the bearers not to
be handed over, and then 3G_MSC-A sends MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to
3G_MSC-B.
NOTE 1: Can be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.
Figure 21: Subsequent handover procedure ii): Successful UMTS to GSM handover\
from 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑B\' requiring a circuit connection
### 8.1.4 Procedure for subsequent UMTS to GSM handover not requiring a
circuit connection
As for the subsequent UMTS to GSM handover with a circuit connection, the same
two cases of subsequent handover apply:
i) the UE/MS moves back to the area of MSC‑A;
ii) the UE/MS moves into the area of a third MSC (MSC‑B\').
#### 8.1.4.1 Description of subsequent UMTS to GSM handover procedure i):
3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑A
The procedure for successful UMTS to GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B back to MSC‑A
without circuit connection is shown in figure 22. The only difference with the
figure 20, is that no circuit release is needed between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B.
Figure 22: Subsequent UMTS to GSM handover procedure i): Successful UMTS\ to
GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑A not requiring a circuit connection
#### 8.1.4.2 Description of the subsequent UMTS to GSM handover procedure
without circuit connection ii): 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑B\'
The procedure for successful UMTS to GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑B\' is
shown in figure 23.
The procedure consists of two parts:
\- a subsequent UMTS to GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B back to 3G_MSC‑A as
described in subclause 8.1.4.1 (the same procedures apply if 3G_MSC-A is
replaced by MSC-A); and
\- a basic handover from 3G_MSC‑A to MSC‑B\' as described in subclause 7.2.
The only difference to the equivalent figure 21 is the omission of the circuit
and handover number allocation signallings.
Figure 23: Subsequent UMTS to GSM handover procedure ii): Successful UMTS\ to
GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑B\' without circuit connection
## 8.2 Handover GSM to UMTS
The following clauses describe two options for the Basic and Subsequent GSM to
UMTS Handover procedures. The first, as described in subclauses 8.2.1 and
8.2.3 respectively, provides for a circuit connection between (3G_)MSC‑A and
(3G_)MSC‑B. The second, as described in subclauses 8.2.2 and 8.2.4
respectively, provides for a Basic and Subsequent Handover without the
provision of a circuit connection between (3G_)MSC‑A and (3G_)MSC‑B. In all
the above mentioned clauses, the following principles apply:
a) during the handover resource allocation, except for the messages explicitly
indicated in b and c below, only the handover related messages that are part
of the applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - shall be
transferred on the E-interface;
b) the trace related messages that are part of the applicable BSSAP subset -
as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - can be sent by the MSC‑A on the E-interface
after successful handover resource allocation. In subclauses 8.2.1 and 8.2.2,
it is however allowed at basic handover initiation on the E-Interface to
transfer one trace related message that is part of the applicable BSSAP subset
- as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - together with the applicable handover
related message. The applicable handover related message shall always appear
as the first message;
c) during the handover resource allocation for subsequent inter-MSC inter-
system handover according to subclauses 8.2.3 and 8.2.4, it is allowed to
transfer either DTAP or RANAP Direct Transfer messages on the E-Interface
between MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B. RANAP Direct Transfer messages shall be used for
this purpose if and only if the basic handover procedure was an inter MSC SRNS
relocation;
d) If 3G_MSC-B or 3G-MSC-B' supports location reporting at change of Service
Area, 3G_MSC-B or 3G_MSC-B\' shall always initiate the Location Reporting
Control procedure at change of Service Area towards the target RNS since no
request for Location Reporting can be received from MSC-A. In that case, the
Location Reporting Control procedure shall be initiated by 3G_MSC-B or
3G-MSC-B' after the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure has been executed
successfully. The change of Service Area shall be reported to MSC-A within an
A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message;
e) during the handover execution, i.e. while the UE/MS is not in communication
with the network, the MSC‑A shall queue all outgoing BSSAP or RANAP messages
until the communication with the UE/MS is resumed;
f) during the execution of a basic inter-system inter-MSC handover to 3G_MSC-B
or a subsequent inter-system inter-MSC handover to a third 3G-MSC-B', only the
handover related messages and the A-Clear-Request message that are part of the
applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] -- may be sent by
the target MSC on the E-interface;
g) during a subsequent inter-system inter-MSC handover back to 3G_MSC-A or to
a third 3G_MSC-B', 3G_MSC-B may initiate either an Iu-Release-Request
procedure or an A-Clear-Request procedure on the E-interface. An Iu-Release-
Request procedure shall be initiated only if the basic handover procedure was
an inter-MSC SRNS relocation;
h) finally, during supervision, i.e. while the UE/MS is not in the area of
MSC‑A after a successful Inter-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover, the subset of
BSSAP procedures and their related messages - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7]
- shall apply on the E-Interface. As the only exception to this rule, in case
of a subsequent inter-MSC SRNS relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third
3G_MSC-B', during the relocation resource allocation, the relocation and trace
related messages that are part of the applicable RANAP subset - as defined in
3GPP TS 29.108 [15] - shall be transferred on the E-interface (see subclause
8.3, a and b).
> If a subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third
> 3G_MSC-B' is cancelled, then the supervision continues, and BSSAP procedures
> and their related messages shall apply on the E-interface;
i) during the intra-3G_MSC‑B GSM to UMTS handover execution, if any, the
3G_MSC‑B shall queue all outgoing BSSAP or RANAP messages until the
communication with the UE/MS is resumed.
### 8.2.1 Basic Handover procedure requiring a circuit connection between
MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B
The procedure used for successful Inter-3G_MSC Handover from GSM to UMTS is
shown in figure 24. Initiation of the GSM to UMTS handover procedure is
described in clause 5. The procedure described in this clause makes use of
messages from the 3GPP TS 48.008 [5], 3GPP TS 25.413 [11] and of the transport
mechanism from the Mobile Application Part (MAP) (3GPP TS 29.002 [12]). After
an Inter-3G_MSC handover further Intra-3G_MSC handovers may occur on 3G_MSC‑B,
these handovers will follow the procedures specified in the previous clauses.
NOTE: Can be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.
Figure 24: Basic GSM to UMTS Handover Procedure requiring a circuit connection
The GSM to UMTS handover is initiated as described in subclause 6.2.2. (This
is represented by A-HO-REQUIRED in figure 24). Upon receipt of the A-HO-
REQUIRED from BSS-A, MSC‑A shall send a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to
3G_MSC‑B including a complete A-HO-REQUEST message.
NOTE: MSC‑A shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER requests while a MAP-
PREPARE-HANDOVER response is pending or before any timeouts.
The MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall carry in the A‑HO-REQUEST all
information needed by 3G_MSC‑B for allocating radio resources in RNS-B, see
3GPP TS 48.008 [5].
The MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall also carry the identity of the target
RNS to which the call is to be handed over, see 3GPP TS 29.002 [12]. 3G_MSC‑B
will return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having retrieved a
Handover Number from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages MAP-
allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request). The
Handover Number shall be used for routing the connection of the call from
MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B.
For speech calls, if 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-
Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu
Supported Codecs List, generate associated RAB parameters and connect a
transcoder. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does
not support the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List,
3G_MSC‑B shall select the appropriate default speech codec.
For handover to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-B shall also generate a NAS Synch
Indicator for the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the Iu Supported Codecs
List was received by 3G_MSC-B and 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec
based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then the Iu Selected codec shall be
indicated in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent from 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑A.
If radio resources are available in RNS-B the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response
will contain the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACK message generated from the Iu-
RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK received from RNS-B, containing the radio resources
definition to be sent by BSS-A to the UE/MS. If the radio resource allocation
is not possible, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-FAILURE
will be sent to MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑B will do the same if a fault is detected on the
identity of the cell where the call has to be handed over. 3G_MSC‑B simply
reports the events related to the dialogue. It is up to MSC‑A to decide the
action to perform if it receives negative responses or the operation fails due
to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER timer.
If an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
request is returned from 3G_MSC‑B, this will be indicated to MSC‑A and MSC‑A
will terminate the handover attempt. MSC‑A shall reject the handover attempt
towards BSS-A. The existing connection to the UE/MS shall not be cleared.
When the A-HO-REQUEST-ACK has been received, MSC‑A shall establish a circuit
between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B by signalling procedures supported by the network.
In figure 24 this is illustrated by the messages IAM (Initial Address Message)
and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling System no 7. 3G_MSC‑B awaits
the capturing of the UE/MS (subclause 6.2.2) on the radio path when the ACM is
sent and MSC‑A initiates the handover execution when ACM is received
(illustrated by the A-HO-COMMAND and described in subclause 6.2.2).
If the BSS-A was connected via an A interface over IP and no transcoding
performed in the BSS then MSC-A shall remove the transcoder between the MSC
and the other party.
3G_MSC‑B transfers to MSC‑A the acknowledgement received from the correct
UE/MS (A-HO-DETECT/A-HO-COMPLETE). The Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT, if received, is
converted to A-HO-DETECT and transferred to MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-
ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE, when received from the
correct UE/MS, is converted to A-HO-COMPLETE and included in the MAP-SEND-END-
SIGNAL request and sent back to MSC‑A. The circuit is through-connected in
MSC‑A when the A-HO-DETECT or the A‑HO‑COMPLETE is received from 3G_MSC‑B. The
old radio channel is released when the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received from
3G_MSC‑B. The sending of the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request starts the MAP
supervision timer for the MAP dialogue between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. When the
MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request including the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received in
MSC‑A the resources in BSS-A shall be cleared.
In order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between
MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B, 3G_MSC‑B must generate an answer signal when Iu-
RELOCATION-DETECT/COMPLETE is received.
3G_MSC‑B shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between MSC‑A and
3G_MSC‑B has been established.
If the circuit between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B cannot be established (e.g. an
unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM). MSC‑A terminates
the inter3G_MSC handover attempt by sending an appropriate MAP message, for
example an ABORT.
MSC‑A shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the fixed
subscriber or the UE/MS and there is no further call control functions to be
performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).
When MSC‑A clears the call to the UE/MS it also clears the call control
functions in MSC‑A and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the
MAP resources in 3G_MSC‑B.
MSC‑A may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP
message to 3G_MSC‑B. If establishment of the circuit between MSC‑A and
3G_MSC‑B has been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.
The GSM to UMTS handover will be aborted by MSC‑A if it detects clearing or
interruption of the radio path before the call has been established on
3G_MSC‑B.
### 8.2.2 Basic GSM to UMTS Handover procedure not requiring the establishment
of a circuit connection between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B
The basic GSM to UMTS handover procedures to be used when no circuit
connection is required by MSC‑A are similar to those described in subclause
8.2.1 for circuit switched calls. The main differences to the procedures
described in subclause 8.2.1 relate to the establishment of circuits between
the network entities and the Handover Number allocation.
In the case of basic GSM to UMTS handover, MSC‑A shall specify to 3G_MSC‑B
that no Handover Number is required in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request (see
3GPP TS 29.002 [12]). As for the basic GSM to UMTS handover using a circuit
connection, the A-HO-REQUEST is transmitted at the same time. Any subsequent
Handover Number allocation procedure will not be invoked until the completion
of the basic GSM to UMTS handover procedure (see clause: Subsequent Channel
Assignment using a circuit connection). 3G_MSC‑B shall then perform the radio
resources allocation as described in subclause 8.2.1. The MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
response shall be returned to MSC‑A including either the translated response
of the radio resources allocation request received from RNS-B (A-HO-REQUEST-
ACK/A-HO-FAILURE). The basic GSM to UMTS handover procedure will continue as
described in clause 8.2.1 except that no circuit connection will be
established towards 3G_MSC‑B.
The relevant case for the basic GSM to UMTS handover without circuit
connection is shown in figure 25. As can be seen the major differences to the
equivalent figure 24 are the omission of any circuit establishment messaging
and the omission of handover number allocation signalling.
Figure 25: Basic GSM to UMTS Handover Procedure without circuit connection
### 8.2.3 Procedure for subsequent GSM to UMTS handover requiring a circuit
connection
After the call has been handed over to MSC‑B, if the UE/MS leaves the GSM area
of MSC‑B during the same call and enters a UTRAN area, subsequent GSM to UMTS
handover is necessary in order to continue the connection.
The following cases apply:
i) the UE/MS moves back to the area of 3G_MSC‑A;
ii) the UE/MS moves into the area of a third 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑B\').
In both cases the call is switched in 3G_MSC‑A; the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A
and MSC‑B shall be released after a successful subsequent handover has been
performed.
#### 8.2.3.1 Description of subsequent GSM to UMTS handover procedure i):
MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A
The procedure for successful GSM to UMTS handover from MSC‑B back to 3G_MSC‑A
is shown in figure 26.
Figure 26: Subsequent GSM to UMTS handover procedure i): successful handover\
from MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A using a circuit connection
The procedure is as follows.
MSC‑B sends the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSC‑A indicating
the new MSC number (3G_MSC‑A number), indicating also the identity of the
target RNS where the call has to be handed over and including a complete A-HO-
REQUEST message. (NOTE: MSC‑B shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-
HANDOVER requests while a handover attempt is pending or before any timeouts).
Since 3G_MSC‑A is the call controlling MSC, this MSC needs no Handover Number
for routing purposes; 3G_MSC‑A can immediately initiate the search for free
radio resources. 3G_MSC‑A then inserts a transcoder between it's RNS and the
connection to the other party.
When radio resources can be assigned, 3G_MSC‑A shall return in the MAP-
PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACK message
generated from the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK received from the RNS-B and
possible extra BSSMAP information, amended by 3G_MSC‑A due to the possible
interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the
RANAP protocol used on the Iu-interface. If radio resources cannot be assigned
or if a fault is detected on the target cell identity, or the target cell
identity in the A-HO-REQUEST is not consistent with the target MSC number, the
MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-FAILURE message
shall be given to MSC‑B, in addition MSC‑B shall maintain the connection with
the UE/MS.
If the procedure in 3G_MSC‑A is successful then MSC‑B can request the UE/MS to
retune to the new RNS-B on 3G_MSC‑A. This is illustrated in figure 26 by the
A-HO-COMMAND message. The operation is successfully completed when 3G_MSC‑A
receives the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message.
After GSM to UMTS handover 3G_MSC‑A shall release the circuit to MSC‑B.
3G_MSC‑A must also terminate the MAP procedure for the basic handover between
3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B by sending an appropriate MAP message. MSC‑B will clear the
resources in BSS-A when the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response is received.
#### 8.2.3.2 Description of subsequent GSM to UMTS handover procedure ii):
MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\'
The procedure for successful GSM to UMTS handover from MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\' is
shown in figure 27.
The procedure consists of two parts:
\- a subsequent handover from MSC‑B back to MSC‑A as described in subclause
7.3.1 (the same procedures apply if MSC-A is replaced by 3G_MSC-A); and
\- a basic GSM to UMTS handover from MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B\' as described in
subclause 8.2.1.
MSC‑B sends the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request to MSC‑A indicating a
new MSC number (which is the identity of 3G_MSC‑B\'), indicating also the
identity of the target RNS where the call has to be handed over and including
a complete A-HO-REQUEST, MSC‑A then starts a basic handover procedure towards
3G_MSC‑B\'.
When MSC‑A receives the ACM from 3G_MSC‑B\', MSC‑A informs MSC‑B that
3G_MSC‑B\' has successfully allocated the radio resources on RNS-B\' side by
sending the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing the complete
A-HO-REQUEST-ACK generated from the RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK received from
RNS-B\' and possible extra BSSMAP information, amended by MSC‑A due to the
possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface
between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B\' and the BSSMAP protocol carried on the
E-interface between MSC‑A and MSC‑B. Now MSC‑B can start the procedure on the
radio path.
For MSC‑A the handover is completed when it has received the MAP-SEND-END-
SIGNAL REQUEST from 3G_MSC‑B\' containing the A-HO-COMPLETE generated from Iu-
RECOLATION COMPLETE received from the RNS-B\'. The circuit between MSC‑A and
MSC‑B is released. MSC‑A also sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to MSC‑B
in order to terminate the original MAP dialogue between MSC‑A and MSC‑B. MSC‑B
releases the radio resources when it receives this message.
If no radio resources can be allocated by 3G_MSC‑B\' or no circuit between
MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B\' can be established or a fault is detected on the target
cell identity or the target cell identity in the A-HO-REQUEST is not
consistent with the target MSC number, MSC‑A informs MSC‑B by using the A-HO-
FAILURE message included in the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response.
MSC‑B shall maintain the existing connection with the UE/MS.
When the subsequent GSM to UMTS handover is completed, 3G_MSC‑B\' is
considered as 3G_MSC‑B. Any further inter-MSC handover is handled as described
above for a subsequent handover.
NOTE 1: Can be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.
Figure 27: Subsequent GSM to UMTS handover procedure ii): Successful handover\
from MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\' requiring a circuit connection
### 8.2.4 Procedure for subsequent GSM to UMTS handover not requiring a
circuit connection
As for the subsequent GSM to UMTS handover with a circuit connection, the same
two cases of subsequent handover apply:
i) the UE/MS moves back to the area of 3G_MSC‑A;
ii) the UE/MS moves into the area of a third 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑B\').
#### 8.2.4.1 Description of subsequent GSM to UMTS handover procedure without
circuit connection i): MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A
The procedure for successful GSM to UMTS handover from MSC‑B back to 3G_MSC‑A
without circuit connection is shown in figure 28. The only difference with the
figure 26, is that no circuit release is needed between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B.
Figure 28: Subsequent GSM to UMTS handover procedure i): Successful handover\
from MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A not requiring a circuit connection
#### 8.2.4.2 Description of subsequent GSM to UMTS handover procedure without
circuit connection ii): MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\'
The procedure for successful GSM to UMTS handover from MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\' is
shown in figure 29.
The procedure consists of two parts:
\- a subsequent handover from MSC‑B back to MSC‑A as described in subclause
7.4.1 (the same procedures apply if MSC-A is replaced by 3G_MSC-A); and
\- a basic GSM to UMTS handover from MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B\' as described in
subclause 8.2.2.
The only difference to the equivalent figure 27 is the omission of the circuit
and handover number allocation signallings.
Figure 29: Subsequent GSM to UMTS handover procedure ii): Successful handover\
from MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\' without circuit connection
## 8.3 SRNS Relocation
The following clauses describe two options for the Basic and Subsequent
Relocation procedures. The first, as described in subclauses 8.3.1 and 8.3.3
respectively, provides for a circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B.
The second, as described in subclauses 8.3.2 and 8.3.4 respectively, provides
for a Basic and Subsequent Relocation without the provision of a circuit
connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B.
In all the above mentioned clauses, the following principles apply:
a) during the relocation resource allocation, except for the messages
explicitly indicated in b and c below, only the relocation related messages
that are part of the applicable RANAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 29.108
[15] - shall be transferred on the E-interface;
b) the trace related messages that are part of the applicable RANAP subset -
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.108 [15] - can be sent by the 3G_MSC‑A on the
E-interface after successful relocation resource allocation. In the clauses
8.3.1 and 8.3.2, it is however allowed at basic relocation initiation on the
E-Interface to transfer one trace invocation related message that is part of
the applicable RANAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 29.108 [15] - together
with the applicable relocation related message. The applicable relocation
related message shall always appear as the first message;
c) during the relocation resource allocation for subsequent inter-MSC SRNS
relocation according to subclauses 8.3.3 and 8.3.4, it is allowed to transfer
either DTAP or RANAP Direct Transfer messages on the E-Interface between
3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B. RANAP Direct Transfer messages shall be used for this
purpose if and only if the basic handover procedure was an inter MSC SRNS
relocation;
d) the Iu-Location Reporting Control message which belongs to the applicable
RANAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 29.108 [15] - can be sent by the 3G_MSC‑A
on the E-interface after successful relocation resource allocation;
e) during the relocation execution, i.e. while the UE is not in communication
with the network, the 3G_MSC‑A shall queue all outgoing RANAP or BSSAP
messages until the communication with the UE is resumed;
f) during the execution of a basic inter-MSC SRNS relocation to 3G_MSC-B or a
subsequent inter-MSC SRNS relocation to a third 3G-MSC-B', only the relocation
related messages and the Iu-Release-Request message that are part of the
applicable RANAP subset \- as defined in 3GPP TS 29.108 [15] -- may be sent by
the target MSC on the E-interface;
g) during a subsequent inter-MSC SRNS relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a
third 3G_MSC-B', 3G_MSC-B may initiate either an Iu-Release-Request procedure
or an A-Clear-Request procedure on the E-interface. An Iu-Release-Request
procedure shall be initiated only if the basic handover procedure was an
inter-MSC SRNS relocation;
h) finally, during supervision, i.e. while the UE is not in the area of
3G_MSC‑A after a successful Inter-3G_MSC relocation, the subset of RANAP
procedures and their related messages - as defined in 3GPP TS 29.108 [15] -
shall apply on the E-Interface. As an exception to this rule, 3G_MSC-B shall
notify 3G_MSC-A of a successfully completed subsequent intra-MSC-B intra GSM
or inter-system handover by using the Internal Handover Indication procedure
as specified in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7]. Furthermore, in case of a subsequent
inter-MSC intra GSM or inter-system handover back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third
3G_MSC-B', during the handover resource allocation, the handover and trace
related messages that are part of the applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in
3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - shall be transferred on the E-interface (see list items a
and b in clause 7, subclauses 8.1 and 8.2, respectively).
> If a subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third
> 3G_MSC-B' is cancelled, then the supervision continues, and RANAP procedures
> and their related messages shall apply on the E-interface.
NOTE: A subsequent inter-MSC intra GSM or GSM to UMTS inter-system handover
back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third 3G_MSC-B' can occur, e.g., if after the basic
inter-MSC SRNS relocation to 3G_MSC-B the MS performed a subsequent
intra-3G_MSC-B UMTS to GSM inter-system handover;
i) during the intra-3G_MSC‑B relocation execution, if any, the 3G_MSC‑B shall
queue all outgoing RANAP messages until the communication with the UE is
resumed.
j) after successful completion of the Intra-3G_MSC-B relocation, if 3G_MSC-B
or 3G-MSC-B' has previously received an order to perform location reporting at
change of Service Area from 3G_MSC-A, it shall act as specified in subclause
6.2.3.
### 8.3.1 Basic relocation procedure requiring a circuit connection between
3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B
The procedure used for successful Inter-3G_MSC SRNS relocation is shown in
figure 30. Initiation of the relocation procedure is described in clause 5.
The procedure described in this clause makes use of messages from the 3GPP TS
25.413 [11] and of the transport mechanism from the Mobile Application Part
(MAP) (3GPP TS 29.002 [12]). After an Inter-3G_MSC SRNS relocation further
Intra-3G_MSC relocations may occur on 3G_MSC‑B, these relocations will follow
the procedures specified in a previous clause.
NOTE 1: Can be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.
Figure 30: Basic SRNS Relocation Procedure requiring a circuit connection
#### 8.3.1.1 With one circuit connection
The relocation is initiated as described in subclause 6.2.3. (This is
represented by IU-RELOC-REQUIRED in figure 30). Upon receipt of the IU-RELOC-
REQUIRED from RNS-A, 3G_MSC‑A shall send a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to
3G_MSC‑B including a complete IU-RELOC-REQUEST message. (NOTE: 3G_MSC‑A shall
not send further MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER requests while a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
response is pending or before any timeouts). The MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request
shall carry in the IU-RELOC-REQUEST all information needed by 3G_MSC‑B for
allocating radio resources in the case of SRNS relocation without Iur
interface, see 3GPP TS 25.413 [11].
For speech calls, 3G_MSC-A shall include the Iu Currently used codec and the
Iu Supported Codecs List in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. 3G_MSC‑A shall
configure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the appropriate default speech
codec. For a relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if this codec is different from the
Iu Currently used codec, 3G_MSC‑A shall also include the NAS Synch Indicator
for the default speech codec in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST.
Alternatively, if 3G_MSC-B is known to support the use of the Iu Supported
Codecs List, 3G_MSC-A may configure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the
preferred codec and indicate this to 3G_MSC-B by including the RAB
configuration indicator in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. For a relocation
to UTRAN Iu mode, if the preferred codec is different from the Iu Currently
used codec, 3G_MSC‑A shall also include the NAS Synch Indicator for the
preferred codec in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST. The decision to use this option
is based on internal configuration information in 3G_MSC-A.
MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall also carry the identity of the target RNS
to which the call is to be relocated, see 3GPP TS 29.002 [12]. 3G_MSC‑B will
return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having retrieved one or several
Handover Numbers from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages MAP-
allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request). The
Handover Numbers shall be used for routing the connections of the calls from
3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B.
For speech calls, if 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-
Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu
Supported Codecs List and connect a transcoder. If the Iu Supported Codecs
List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codec
based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select the appropriate
default speech codec.
3G_MSC-B shall reconfigure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the Iu
Selected codec:
\- if the RAB configuration indicator is included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
request and the codec selected by 3G_MSC-B is different from the preferred
codec; or
\- if the RAB configuration indicator is not included in the MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER request and the codec selected by 3G_MSC-B is different from the
appropriate default speech codec.
Additionally, for a relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if the Iu Selected codec is
different from the Iu Currently used codec, 3G_MSC-B shall include the NAS
Synch Indicator for the Iu Selected codec in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST. If the
Iu Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B and 3G_MSC-B supports the
selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then the Iu Selected
codec shall be indicated in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent from
3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A.
If radio resources are available in 3G_MSC‑B, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
response will contain the complete IU-RELOC-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE message
received from RNS-B, containing the radio resources definition to be sent by
RNS-A to the UE (in case of relocation without Iur interface) and possible
extra RANAP information, amended by 3G_MSC‑B due to the possible interworking
between the RANAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the RANAP protocol
used on the Iu-interface. If the radio resource allocation is not possible,
the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response containing an IU-RELOCATION-FAILURE will be
sent to 3G_MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑B will do the same if a fault is detected on the
identity of the RNS where the call has to be relocated. 3G_MSC‑B simply
reports the events related to the dialogue. It is up to 3G_MSC‑A to decide the
action to perform if it receives negative responses or the operation fails due
to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER timer.
If an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
request is returned from 3G_MSC‑B, this will be indicated to 3G_MSC‑A and
3G_MSC‑A will terminate the relocation attempt. The existing connection to the
UE shall not be cleared.
When the IU-RELOC-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE has been received, 3G_MSC‑A shall
establish a circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B by signalling procedures
supported by the network. In figure 30 this is illustrated by the messages IAM
(Initial Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling
System no 7. 3G_MSC‑B awaits the capturing of the UE (subclause 6.2.3) on the
radio path when the ACM is sent and 3G_MSC‑A initiates the relocation
execution when ACM is received (illustrated by the IU-RELOC-COMMAND and
described in subclause 6.2.3). 3G_MSC‑A shall remove the transcoder between
the MSC and other party.
3G_MSC‑B transfers to 3G_MSC‑A the acknowledgement received from the correct
UE (IU-RELOC-DETECT/IU-RELOC-COMPLETE). The IU-RELOC-DETECT, if received, is
transferred to 3G_MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The
IU-RELOC-COMPLETE, when received from the correct UE, is included in the MAP-
SEND-END-SIGNAL request and sent back to 3G_MSC‑A. The circuit is through
connected in 3G_MSC‑A when the IU-RELOC-DETECT or the IU-RELOC-COMPLETE is
received from 3G_MSC‑B. The old radio resources are released when the IU-
RELOC-COMPLETE message is received from 3G_MSC‑B. The sending of the MAP-SEND-
END-SIGNAL request starts the MAP supervision timer for the MAP dialogue
between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. When the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request including
the IU-RELOC-COMPLETE message is received in 3G_MSC‑A, the resources in RNS-A
shall be released.
In order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between
3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B, 3G_MSC‑B must generate an answer signal when IU-RELOC-
DETECT/COMPLETE is received.
3G_MSC‑B shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A
and 3G_MSC‑B has been established.
If the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B cannot be established, (e.g. an
unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM) 3G_MSC‑A terminates
the inter-3G_MSC relocation attempt by sending an appropriate MAP message, for
example an ABORT.
3G_MSC‑A shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the
fixed subscriber or the UE and there is no further call control functions to
be performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).
When 3G_MSC‑A clears the call to the UE it also clears the call control
functions in 3G_MSC‑A and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release
the MAP resources in 3G_MSC‑B.
3G_MSC‑A may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP
message to 3G_MSC‑B. If establishment of the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and
3G_MSC‑B has been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.
The relocation will be aborted by 3G_MSC‑A if it detects release or
interruption of the radio path before the call has been established on
3G_MSC‑B.
#### 8.3.1.2 With multiple circuit connections (Optional functionality)
##### 8.3.1.2.1 3G_MSC-B does not support multiple bearers
If 3G_MSC-A supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS
23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-A shall have the following functionality additionally to
the description in subclause 8.3.1.1.
Upon receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-A, 3G_MSC-A generates IU-
RELOCATION-REQUEST and sends a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSC-B
including the IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message, which may include multiple
bearers. If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that 3G_MSC-B does not support
multiple bearers, 3G_MSC-A shall select one bearer to be handed over if the UE
is engaged with multiple bearers. 3G_MSC-A reconstructs IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST
and sends again a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSC-B including the IU-
RELOCATION-REQUEST message, which includes only the selected bearer.
When MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response including an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK is
received from 3G_MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A sends IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND, which indicates
the bearers not to be handed over as bearers to be released, to RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request from 3G_MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A
shall release calls via 3G_MSC-B, which has been carried by the bearers not to
be handed over, and then 3G_MSC-A sends IU-RELEASE-COMMAND to RNS-A.
##### 8.3.1.2.2 3G_MSC-B supports multiple bearers
If 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC_B support the optional supplementary service Multicall
(See 3GPP TS 23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B shall have the following
functionality additionally to the description in subclause 8.3.1.1.
Upon receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-A, 3G_MSC-A generates IU-
RELOCATION-REQUEST and sends a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSC-B
including the IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message, which may include multiple
bearers.
When MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request including an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message
is received by the 3G_MSC-B and the number of bearers included in the IU-
RELOCATION-REQUEST message has exceeded the maximum number of bearers
supported by 3G_MSC-B, the 3G_MSC-B shall select several bearers so that the
number of bearers will fulfil the range of 3G_MSC-B capability. In this case
3G_MSC-B shall reconstruct IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to cope with the
capability of 3G_MSC-B. The 3G_MSC-B shall retrieve multiple Handover Numbers
from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages MAP-allocate-handover-number
request and MAP-send-handover-report request several times). The number of
Handover Numbers depends on the number of RAB IDs in the reconstructed IU-
RELOCATION-REQUEST.
After the completion of Handover Number allocation 3G_MSC-B may select several
bearers and reconstruct IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST again if the number of
successfully allocated Handover Numbers is less than the number of required
bearers, and sends IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST to RNS-B.
After the reception of IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK from RNS-B, the 3G_MSC-B
shall generate Relocation Number List, which includes couples of RAB ID (See
3GPP TS 25.413 [11]) and Handover Number successfully allocated. Then the
3G_MSC-B sends MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response including Relocation Number List
back to the 3G_MSC-A.
Upon receipt of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response 3G_MSC-A shall establish
circuits between 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B by signalling procedures supported by
the network according to the Relocation Number List. When 3G_MSC-A receives
all the results from attempted circuits (the results may be successful ACM
message or unsuccessful backward message for each attempt) and if at least one
circuit has been successfully established, 3G_MSC-A sends IU-RELOCATION-
COMMAND, which indicates the bearers failed to set up in RNS-B and the bearers
associated with circuits which has failed to set up as bearers to be released,
to RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request from 3G_MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A
shall release calls via 3G_MSC-B, which has been carried by the bearers failed
to set up in RNS-B and the bearers associated with circuits which has failed
to set up, and then 3G_MSC-A sends IU-RELEASE-COMMAND to RNS-A.
If no circuit connection has been successfully established 3G_MSC-A terminates
the inter-3G_MSC relocation attempt by sending an appropriate MAP massage, for
example ABORT.
### 8.3.2 Basic relocation procedure not requiring the establishment of a
circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B
The basic SRNS relocation procedures to be used when no circuit connection is
required by 3G_MSC‑A are similar to those described in subclause 8.3.1 for
circuit switched calls. The main differences to the procedures described in
subclause 8.3.1 relate to the establishment of circuits between the network
entities and the Handover Number allocation.
In the case of basic relocation, 3G_MSC‑A shall specify to 3G_MSC‑B that no
Handover Number is required in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request (see 3GPP TS
29.002 [12]). As for the basic relocation using a circuit connection, the IU-
RELOC-REQUEST is transmitted at the same time together with the identity of
the target RNS to which the call is to be relocated. Any subsequent Handover
Number allocation procedure will not be invoked until the completion of the
basic relocation procedure (see clause: Subsequent Channel Assignment using a
circuit connection). 3G_MSC‑B shall then perform the radio resources
allocation as described in subclause 8.3.1 if applicable. The MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER response shall be returned to 3G_MSC‑A including either the response
of the radio resources allocation request received from RNS-B (IU-RELOC-
REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE/IU-RELOC-FAILURE with possible extra RANAP information.
This extra information is amended by 3G_MSC‑B due to the possible interworking
between the RANMAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the RANAP protocol
used on the Iu-interface). The basic relocation procedure will continue as
described in subclause 8.3.1 except that no circuit connection will be
established towards 3G_MSC‑B.
The relevant case for the basic relocation without circuit connection is shown
in figure 31. As can be seen the major differences to the equivalent figure 30
are the omission of any circuit establishment messaging and the omission of
handover number allocation signalling.
Figure 31: Basic SRNS relocation procedure without a circuit connection
### 8.3.3 Procedure for subsequent relocation requiring a circuit connection
After the call has been relocated to 3G_MSC‑B, if the UE leaves the area of
3G_MSC‑B during the same call, subsequent relocation is necessary in order to
continue the connection when no Iur interface exists between the involved
RNSs, or to optimise the transmission path when the Iur interface is used.
The following cases apply:
i) the UE moves back to the area of 3G_MSC‑A;
ii) the UE moves into the area of a third 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑B\').
In both cases the call is switched in 3G_MSC‑A; the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A
and 3G_MSC‑B shall be released after a successful subsequent relocation has
been performed.
If 3G_MSC-A is replaced by MSC-A in the procedures, then a subsequent
relocation from 3G_MSC-B to 3G_MSC-B\' shall not be possible since MSC-A does
not support the RANAP protocol.
#### 8.3.3.1 Description of subsequent relocation procedure i): 3G_MSC‑B to
3G_MSC‑A
The procedure for successful relocation from 3G_MSC‑B back to 3G_MSC‑A is
shown in figure 32.
Figure 32: Subsequent relocation procedure i) successful relocation\ from
3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A using a circuit connection
##### 8.3.3.1.1 With one circuit connection
The procedure is as follows.
3G_MSC‑B sends the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSC‑A
indicating the new 3G_MSC number (3G_MSC‑A number), indicating also the
identity of the target RNS where the call has to be relocated and including a
complete IU-RELOC-REQUEST message.
For speech calls, 3G_MSC-B shall configure the RANAP RAB parameters according
to the appropriate default speech codec. For a relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if
this codec is different from the Iu Currently used codec, 3G_MSC‑B shall also
include the NAS Synch Indicator for the default speech codec in the Iu-
RELOCATION-REQUEST.
Alternatively, if 3G_MSC-A is known to support the use of the Iu Supported
Codecs List, 3G_MSC-B may configure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the
preferred codec and indicate this to 3G_MSC-A by including the RAB
configuration indicator in the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request. For a
relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if the preferred codec is different from the Iu
Currently used codec, 3G_MSC‑B shall also include the NAS Synch Indicator for
the preferred codec in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST.
NOTE: 3G_MSC‑B shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER requests
while a relocation attempt is pending or before any timeouts.
Since 3G_MSC‑A is the call controlling 3G_MSC, this 3G_MSC needs no Handover
Number for routing purposes; 3G_MSC‑A can immediately initiate the relocation
towards the target RNS.
For speech calls, 3G_MSC‑A shall select an Iu Selected codec and connect a
transcoder.
3G_MSC-A shall reconfigure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the Iu
Selected codec:
\- if the RAB configuration indicator is included in the MAP-PREPARE-
SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request, and the codec selected by 3G_MSC‑A is different
from the preferred codec; or
\- if the RAB configuration indicator is not included in the MAP-PREPARE-
SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request and the codec selected by 3G_MSC‑A is different
from the appropriate default speech codec.
Additionally, for a relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if the Iu Selected codec is
different from the Iu Currently used codec, 3G_MSC-A shall include the NAS
Synch Indicator for the Iu Selected codec in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST.
When relocation can be initiated, 3G_MSC‑A shall return in the MAP-PREPARE-
SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response the complete IU-RELOC-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE message
received from the RNS-B and possible extra RANAP information, amended by
3G_MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the RANAP protocol carried
on the E-interface and the RANAP protocol used on the Iu-interface. If a radio
resource cannot be assigned or if a fault is detected on the target RNS
identity, or the target RNS identity in the IU-RELOC-REQUEST is not consistent
with the target 3G_MSC number, the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response
containing an IU-RELOC-FAILURE message shall be given to 3G_MSC‑B, in addition
3G_MSC‑B shall maintain the connection with the UE.
If the procedure in 3G_MSC‑A is successful then 3G_MSC‑B can request the UE to
retune to the new RNS-B on 3G_MSC‑A in the case of relocation without Iur
interface, or request RNS-B to become serving RNS in the case of relocation
with Iur interface. This is illustrated in figure 32 by the IU-RELOC-COMMAND
message. The operation is successfully completed when 3G_MSC‑A receives the
IU-RELOC-COMPLETE message.
After relocation 3G_MSC‑A shall release the circuit to 3G_MSC‑B.
3G_MSC‑A must also terminate the MAP procedure for the basic relocation
between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B by sending an appropriate MAP message. 3G_MSC‑B
will release the resources in RNS-A when the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response is
received.
##### 8.3.3.1.2 With multiple circuit connections (Optional functionality)
If 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC_B support the optional supplementary service Multicall
(See 3GPP TS 23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B shall have the following
functionality additionally to the description in subclause 8.3.3.1.1.
Upon receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-A, 3G_MSC-B generates IU-
RELOCATION-REQUEST which may include several bearers and sends it to 3G_MSC-A
over MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request.
3G_MSC-A sends IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST to RNS-B and receives IU-RELOCATION-
REQUEST-ACK.
When MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response is received from 3G_MSC-A,
3G_MSC-B sends IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND, which indicates the bearers failed to
set up in RNS-B as bearers to be released, to RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, 3G_MSC-A
shall release calls via RNS-B, which has been carried by the bearers failed to
set up in RNS-B, and then 3G_MSC-A sends MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to
3G_MSC-B.
#### 8.3.3.2 Description of subsequent relocation procedure ii): 3G_MSC‑B to
3G_MSC‑B\'
The procedure for successful relocation from 3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\' is shown
in figure 33.
The procedure consists of two parts:
\- a subsequent relocation from 3G_MSC‑B back to 3G_MSC‑A as described in
subclause 8.3.3.1; and
\- a basic relocation from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B\' as described in subclause
8.3.1.
##### 8.3.3.2.1 With one circuit connection
3G_MSC‑B sends the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSC‑A
indicating a new 3G_MSC number (which is the identity of 3G_MSC‑B\'),
indicating also the target RNS identity and including a complete IU-RELOC-
REQUEST, 3G_MSC‑A then starts a basic relocation procedure towards 3G_MSC‑B\'.
For speech calls, 3G_MSC-B shall configure the RANAP RAB parameters according
to the appropriate default speech codec. For a relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if
this codec is different from the Iu Currently used codec, 3G_MSC‑B shall also
include the NAS Synch Indicator for the default speech codec in the Iu-
RELOCATION-REQUEST.
Alternatively, if 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B' are known to support the use of the
Iu Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC-B may configure the RANAP RAB parameters
according to the preferred codec and indicate this to 3G_MSC-A by including
the RAB configuration indicator in the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER
request. For a relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if the preferred codec is
different from the Iu Currently used codec, 3G_MSC‑B shall also include the
NAS Synch Indicator for the preferred codec in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST. The
decision to use this option is based on internal configuration information in
3G_MSC-B.
When 3G_MSC‑A receives the ACM from 3G_MSC‑B\', 3G_MSC‑A informs 3G_MSC‑B that
3G_MSC‑B\' has successfully allocated the radio resources on RNS-B\' side by
sending the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing the complete
IU-RELOC-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE received from RNS-B\' and possible extra RANAP
information, amended by 3G_MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the
RANAP protocol carried on the E-interface between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B\' and
the RANAP protocol carried on the E‑interface between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B.
Now 3G_MSC‑B can start the procedure on the radio path if needed.
For 3G_MSC‑A the relocation is completed when it has received the MAP-SEND-
END-SIGNAL REQUEST from 3G_MSC‑B\'containing the IU-RELOC-COMPLETE received
from the RNS-B\'. The circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B is released.
3G_MSC‑A also sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to 3G_MSC‑B in order to
terminate the original MAP dialogue between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. 3G_MSC‑B
releases the radio resources when it receives this message.
If no radio resource can be allocated by 3G_MSC‑B\' or no circuit between
3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B\' can be established or a fault is detected on the
target RNS identity or the target RNS identity in the IU-RELOC-REQUEST is not
consistent with the target 3G_MSC number, 3G_MSC‑A informs 3G_MSC‑B by using
the IU-RELOC-FAILURE message included in the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER
response. 3G_MSC‑B shall maintain the existing connection with the UE.
When the subsequent relocation is completed, 3G_MSC‑B\' is considered as
3G_MSC‑B. Any further inter-3G_MSC relocation is handled as described above
for a subsequent relocation.
##### 8.3.3.2.2 With multiple circuit connections (Optional functionality)
If 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B support the optional supplementary service Multicall
(See 3GPP TS 23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B shall have the following
functionality additionally to the description in subclause 8.3.3.2.1.
Upon receipt of the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-B 3G_MSC-B generates an
IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message which may include multiple bearer and sends it
to 3G_MSC-A over MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request.
Upon receipt of the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER request from 3G_MSC-B,
3G_MSC-A starts a basic relocation procedure towards 3G_MSC-B\'.
##### 8.3.3.2.2.1 3G_MSC-B\' does not support multiple bearers {#g_msc-b-does-
not-support-multiple-bearers-1 .H6}
If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that 3G_MSC-B\' does not support multiple
bearers, 3G_MSC-A shall select one bearer to be handed over. 3G_MSC-A
reconstructs IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST and sends again a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
request to 3G_MSC-B\' including the IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message, which
includes only the selected bearer. Upon receipt of MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
response from 3G_MSC-B\', 3G_MSC-A shall reconstructs IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-
ACK to indicate the bearers not to be handed over as the bearers failed to set
up in IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK and send it over MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-
HANDOVER response to 3G_MSC-B.
When MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response is received from 3G_MSC-A
3G_MSC-B sends IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND, which indicates the bearers failed to
set up as bearers to be released, to RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request from 3G_MSC-B\', 3G_MSC-A
shall release calls via 3G_MSC-B\', which has been carried by the bearers
failed to set up, and then 3G_MSC-A sends MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to
3G_MSC-B.
##### 8.3.3.2.2.2 3G_MSC-B\' supports multiple bearers {#g_msc-b-supports-
multiple-bearers-1 .H6}
If some of circuit connections failed to set up between 3G_MSC-A and
3G_MSC-B\', 3G_MSC-A shall reconstruct IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK message so
that the IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK includes only the bearers which have
successfully established circuit connection and sends it to 3G_MSC-B over MAP-
PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response.
When MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response is received from 3G_MSC-A
3G_MSC-B sends IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND, which indicates the bearers failed to
set up as bearers to be released, to RNS-A.
After 3G_MSC-A receives MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request from 3G_MSC-B\', 3G_MSC-A
shall release calls via 3G_MSC-B\', which has been carried by the bearers
failed to set up, and then 3G_MSC-A sends MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to
3G_MSC-B.
NOTE 1: Can be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.
Figure 33: Subsequent relocation procedure ii) Successful SRNS relocation\
from 3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\' requiring a circuit connection
### 8.3.4 Procedure for subsequent relocation not requiring a circuit
connection
As for the subsequent relocation with a circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A
and 3G_MSC‑B, the same two cases of subsequent relocation apply:
i) the UE moves back to the area of 3G_MSC‑A;
ii) the UE moves into the area of a third 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑B\').
If 3G_MSC-A is replaced by MSC-A in the procedures, then a subsequent
relocation from 3G_MSC-B to 3G_MSC-B\' shall not be possible since MSC-A does
not support the RANAP protocol.
#### 8.3.4.1 Description of subsequent relocation procedure i): 3G_MSC‑B to
3G_MSC‑A
The procedure for successful relocation from 3G_MSC‑B back to 3G_MSC‑A without
circuit connection is shown in figure 34. The only difference with the figure
32 is that no circuit release is needed between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B.
Figure 34: Subsequent relocation procedure i) successful relocation\ from
3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B not requiring a circuit connection
#### 8.3.4.2 Description of subsequent relocation procedure ii): 3G_MSC‑B to
3G_MSC‑B\'\'
The procedure for successful relocation from 3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\' is shown
in figure 35.
The procedure consists of two parts:
\- a subsequent relocation from 3G_MSC‑B back to 3G_MSC‑A as described in
subclause 8.3.4.1; and
\- a basic relocation from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B\' as described in subclause
8.3.2.
The only difference to the equivalent figure 33 is the omission of the circuit
and handover number allocation signallings.
Figure 35: Subsequent relocation procedure ii) Successful SRNS relocation\
from 3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑B\' not requiring a circuit connection
# 9 Detailed procedures in MSC‑A
## 9.1 BSS/MSC and MS/MSC procedures in MSC‑A (functional unit 1)
The handover procedures in this functional unit consist of:
i) signalling between the MS and the MSC;
ii) signalling between the BSS and the MSC for access management.
## 9.2 Call control procedures MSC‑A (functional unit 2)
The call control procedures related to handover in MSC‑A can be divided into
two functional entities:
\- the first entity is the call control procedure as part of the normal
interworking between the PSTN/ISDN and the PLMN; for an MS originating call
MSC‑A is the originating exchange, for an MS terminating call MSC‑A is the
destination exchange;
\- the second entity is the call control procedure for the connection between
MSC‑A and MSC‑B in case of a handover from MSC‑A to MSC‑B. For this call
control procedure the following applies.
Call set-up:
\- the connection to MSC‑B is set up by procedures relevant to the signalling
system used in the PSTN/ISDN to which MSC‑A is connected. The call is set up
by using the MS Handover Number received from MSC‑B as part of the MAP
procedure;
\- the call set-up direction will always be from MSC‑A to MSC‑B, even when the
call was originally established by the MS. Functional unit 2 (see figure 2)
should therefore keep information on call set-up direction in order to be able
to interpret correctly any clearing signals (see below);
\- the unit should indicate the address complete condition to functional unit
3 and through-connect without awaiting the answer signal from MSC‑B. This
applies also to signalling systems where address complete signals are not
supported. In such cases an artificial address complete is established by
functional unit 2.
Call clearing:
\- call clearing consists of two parts: after inter-MSC handover, clearing of
the MS-BSS connection and clearing of the inter-MSC connection. If a request
to release the call is generated by the network while the MS is re-tuning from
one BSS to another BSS, then MSC‑A shall begin clearing the call to the
network and queue the call release to the MS until the MS has resumed
communication. This includes the case when MSC‑B and/or MSC‑B\' are involved;
\- the MAP procedures are used to transfer information between MSC‑B and MSC‑A
in order to maintain full call control within MSC‑A. MSC‑A determines, based
on information received from MSC‑B, the appropriate signals (according to 3GPP
TS 24.008 [10]) to be sent to the MS, and sends this information to MSC‑B;
\- when MSC‑A clears the call to the MS it also clears the call control
functions in MSC‑B and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the
MAP resources in MSC‑B. The clearing of the connection is by procedures
relevant to the signalling system in the PSTN/ISDN to which MSC‑A is
connected;
\- when the Signalling System no 7 ISDN User Part is used, the normal
symmetric release procedures apply on both the connection to the fixed network
and to MSC‑B;
\- when a signalling system is used without a symmetric release possibility,
some notice should be given to the clear-forward and clear-back procedures;
\- for MS terminating calls the following conditions apply on clear-forward
and clear-back:
\- when a clear-forward signal is received on interface B\' (see figure 1),
MSC‑A clears the circuit to MSC‑B by normal clear-forward procedures;
\- when a clear-back signal is received from MSC‑B, MSC‑A starts normal clear-
back procedures towards the fixed network (interface B\') and sends the clear-
forward signal on interface B\'\' in order to clear the connection with MSC‑B.
NOTE 1: This case corresponds to a fault situation.
\- for MS originated calls the following applies:
\- when MSC‑A receives a clear-back signal from MSC‑B, this signal must be
interpreted as indicating a clear-forward condition. MSC‑A then clears both
the connection on interface B\' (see figure 1) and to MSC‑B by normal clear-
forward procedures.
NOTE 2: This case corresponds to a fault situation.
\- when MSC‑A receives a clear-back signal on interface B\', MSC‑A should
distinguish between national and international connections:
\- for international connections where the Q.118 [1] supervision is done in
the ISC, MSC‑A sends a clear-forward signal on both interface B\' to the fixed
network and interface B\'\' to MSC‑B;
\- for national connections or for international connections where the Q.118
[1] supervision is not done in the ISC, a timer is started according to
national practice for clear-back supervision and MSC‑A proceeds as follows:
i) if a clear-back signal is received from MSC‑B, MSC‑A interprets this as
indicating a clear-forward condition and proceeds by clearing the connections
on interface B\' and to MSC‑B by normal clear-forward procedures;
ii) if the timer expires, MSC‑A proceeds by normal clear-forward of the
connections on interface B\' and to MSC‑B.
## 9.3 Handover control procedures MSC‑A (functional unit 3)
The procedures of functional unit 3 are given in terms of SDL diagrams in
figure 41. To easily distinguish the interface concerned the messages received
or sent from this unit are prefixed with either \'MAP\' for a MAP message,
\'A\' for an A-Interface message or \'I\' for an ISDN/PSTN message.
The procedures of functional unit 3 include:
i) initiation. The initiation condition is shown by the signal A-HANDOVER-
REQUIRED.
The diagram also includes queuing when there is no channel available. Calls
for which handover has been initiated should be queued with priority higher
than normal calls. They should have lower priority than emergency calls.
ii) handover of calls within the area of MSC‑A, i.e. handover case i). In this
case MSC‑A controls the procedures on both the previous and the new radio
channel, using signals A-HANDOVER-REQUEST and A-HANDOVER-COMMAND. The handover
procedure is completed when A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE is received. If this signal is
not received (expiry of timer T102), the radio path and the connection on
interface B\' are released.
In the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls for subsequent users of the VGCS
channel uplink the original connection shall always be maintained.
For handover devices with three-party capabilities the handover device is
first set up so that all interfaces A\', A\'\' and B\' are connected
(illustrated by the signal \'set up handover device\'). This is done when the
Handover Command is sent to the MS . The device is connected in its final
position (i.e. A\'\' to B\' for case ii)) (illustrated by the signal \'connect
handover device\') when A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE is received.
iii) handover to MSC‑B . This procedure is the one described in subclauses 7.1
and 7.2. For handover devices with three-party capabilities the handover
device is set-up when MSC‑A sends the Handover Command to the MS , i.e. the
interfaces A\', B\' and B\'\' are then connected. The device is connected in
its final position (i.e. B\' to B\'\') when the successful procedure
indication is received from functional unit 4.
iv) subsequent handover to MSC‑A . The procedure is described in subclauses
7.3 and 7.4. When a handover to MSC‑A indication is received from functional
unit 4, the handover device is set up so that interfaces B\', B\'\' and A\'
are connected (for handover devices with three-party capabilities). When
A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE is received, the device is connected in its final position
(i.e. B\' to A\').
If A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE is not received (expiry of timer T104), the handover
device releases interface A\', B\' and B\'\'.
v) subsequent handover to a third MSC (MSC‑B\') . The procedure is described
in subclauses 7.3 and 7.4. The handover device is set up in its initial
position, (i.e. interconnection of interfaces B\', B\'\' and B\'\'\') when the
connection to MSC‑B\' has been established. MSC‑B is informed via functional
unit 4 that the connection has been established and that the procedure on the
radio path can be initiated. The device is connected in its final position
(i.e. B\' to B\'\'\') when a successful procedure indication is received from
functional unit 4. MSC‑B is informed that all procedures in MSC‑B can be
terminated (illustrated by the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response). The device
returns to the state where B\' and B\'\' are connected if the subsequent
handover procedure fails.
Timers in MSC‑A.
The procedures are supervised by timers in order to avoid a deadlock when
responses are not received or the procedures fail. The following timers are
defined:
> T101: this timer supervises the queuing time for a free channel. If T101
> expires, a no channel indication is generated, a retry procedure could be
> applied as described in subclause 6.1. T101 is set by O&M,
>
> T102: this timer supervises the time for handover completion for handover
> between BSSs in MSC‑A. T102 is set by O&M,
>
> T103: this timer supervises the time between issuing an A-HANDOVER-COMMAND
> from MSC‑A and receiving a successful procedure indication from MSC‑B. This
> timer also supervises the time between sending an A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE
> to MSC‑B and receiving a successful procedure indication from MSC‑B\'. If
> T103 expires, the handover procedure is terminated. T103 is set by O&M,
>
> T104: this timer supervises the time between sending of an A-HO-REQUEST-
> ACKNOWLEDGE to MSC‑B and receiving the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE from BSS-B on
> MSC‑A. If the timer expires, the new radio channel is released. T104 is set
> by O&M.
## 9.3A BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support control procedures
The \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" for AoIP is performed by the
MSC that is currently serving the connected BSS (in the following just termed
\"serving MSC\"), it may be either MSC-A, MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A or 3G_MSC-B.
The \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" control procedures in serving
MSC include:
i) **Handover enquiry.** This procedure is only part of the MSC-initiated
\"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" described in subclause 6.3.3. The
MSC initiates the handover enquiry by sending an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-ENQUIRY
message and starting timer T106.
The handover enquiry phase is completed when an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED
message is received from the BSS with cause code \"response to an INTERNAL
HANDOVER ENQUIRY message\". If this message is not received (expiry of timer
T106), or the BSS responds with an A‑HANDOVER-FAILURE message, or the BSS
sends an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message with another cause code, then
the MSC terminates the MSC-initiated \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC
Support\".
ii) **Initiation.** The initiation condition is given by reception of the
A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message. This starts the Internal Handover
Preparation phase for the serving MSC; the serving MSC starts timer T105.
Calls for which Internal Handover Preparation has been initiated should be
handled with priority higher than normal calls. They should have lower
priority than emergency calls. During that phase the serving MSC considers the
A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED parameters, tries to allocate the necessary
resources.
The Internal Handover Preparation phase for the serving MSC ends when the
serving MSC sends the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message or an A-INTERNAL-
HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT message or when timer T105 expires.
If the serving MSC can not perform the \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC
Support\", then it shall send an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT Message
to the BSS and shall release all potentially allocated resources as if no
A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message was received.
If timer T105 expires before the serving MSC could send the A-INTERNAL
HANDOVER-COMMAND message, then the serving MSC shall consider the Internal
Handover Preparation phase as terminated without success and shall release any
allocated resources for the Internal Handover such that the status returns as
it was prior to receiving the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message. No
response shall be sent to the BSS after the expiry of timer T105.
ii) **Execution.** Serving MSC controls the \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC
Support\" by sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message. The \"BSS
Internal Handover with MSC Support\" is completed when the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE
message is received. If this signal is not received (expiry of timer T102),
the radio path and all the connections and resources associated to that call
shall be released.
For handover devices with three-party capabilities, the handover device is
first set up so that all interfaces A\', A\'\' and B\' are connected. This is
perfomed before the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message is sent to the BSS.
The handover device may be adjusted when the A-HANDOVER-DETECT message is
received. The handover device is connected in its final position (i.e. A\'\'
to B\') when the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message is received.
**Timers in serving MSC for Internal Handover Preparation**
The procedures are supervised by timers in order to avoid a deadlock when
responses are not received or the procedures fail. The following additional
timers are defined:
T105: this timer supervises the Internal Handover [Preparation]{.underline}
procedure between BSS and serving MSC. T105 is set by O&M in relation to timer
\"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]). T105 defines the [maximum]{.underline} time a
serving MSC may take to respond to an \"INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED\" message.
Timer \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) defines the [minimum]{.underline} time the
BSS will to wait before it can send a new or repeated (INTERNAL) HANDOVER
REQUIRED message or an A-HANDOVER FAILURE. T105 shall be configured to be
atleast one round trip delay shorter than the time configured for \"T25\"
(3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) to minimise the risk of crossing messages.
T106: this timer supervises the time between sending of an A-INTERNAL-
HANDOVER-ENQUIRY message to the BSS and receiving an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-
REQUIRED or A‑HANDOVER-FAILURE message from the BSS. If T106 expires, the
handover procedure is terminated. T106 is set by O&M and should be
sufficiently long so that no late responses from BSS can be expected after its
expiry.
## 9.4 MAP procedures in MSC‑A (functional unit 4)
The MAP procedures for handover are defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [12]. They
include:
\- procedures for basic handover;
\- procedures for subsequent handover.
These procedures are as outlined in clause 7.
## 9.5 Interworking between Handover control procedures and MAP procedures in
MSC‑A
The interworking between the Handover control procedures and the MAP
procedures for handover is defined in 3GPP TS 29.010 [8]. It includes:
\- interworking at basic handover initiation;
\- interworking at subsequent handover completion.
This interworking is not described in the present document.
## 9.6 Compatibility with GSM Phase 1
If the MSC‑A initiates an Inter-MSC handover procedure according to Phase 2
MAP and BSSMAP protocols while using a Phase 1 BSSMAP protocol towards BSS-A,
MSC‑A has to perform the protocol interworking.
The same holds if a Phase 2 BSSMAP protocol is used between MSC‑A and BSS-A
and the E‑interface supports only Phase 1 protocol.
# 10 Detailed procedures in MSC‑B
## 10.1 BSS/MSC (MS/BSS) procedures MSC‑B (functional unit 1)
The handover procedures in this functional unit consist of:
i) signalling between the MS and the MSC;
ii) signalling between the BS and the MSC for access management.
Signals exchanged with functional unit 3 are indicated in subclause 10.3.
## 10.2 Call control procedures MSC‑B (functional unit 2)
These procedures relate to the call control in MSC‑B of the \"handover\"
connection with MSC‑A. For these procedures the following apply:
Call set-up:
\- the connection is set up by MSC‑A. MSC‑B should provide, if possible, the
following backward signals:
\- signals indicating unsuccessful call set-up and, if possible, the cause of
call failure;
\- address complete signal;
\- answer signal (see note).
NOTE: The answer signal is not related to answering by the MS and it has no
meaning in the handover procedure between MSC‑A and MSC‑B. But after
successful handover or successful subsequent channel assignment using a
circuit connection between MSC‑A and MSC‑B this signal is needed for bringing
the connection in the answered state in the intermediate PSTN/ISDN exchanges.
\- there will be no indication that the call applies to a handover. This
information has to be derived from the MS Handover Number received during call
set-up in relation to the earlier MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request/MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER response procedure between MSC‑A and MSC‑B.
Call clearing:
\- call clearing consists of two parts after inter-MSC handover: clearing of
the BSS-MS connection and clearing of the inter-MSC connection, this case is
only applicable to calls successfully handed over. If a request to release the
call is generated by the network while the MS is re-tuning from one BSS to
another BSS, then MSC‑B shall begin clearing the call to the network and queue
the call release to the MS until the MS has resumed communication;
\- the MAP is used to transfer information between MSC‑A and MSC‑B in order to
make it possible for MSC‑B to send the appropriate signals to the MS,
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [10], and still leave the call control to MSC‑A.
MSC‑A normally initiates release of the connection between MSC‑A and MSC‑B.
Exceptionally MSC‑B is allowed to release the connection if no MAP-SEND-END-
SIGNAL response is received, or if the Handover is to be aborted.
\- when the Signalling System no 7 ISDN User Part is used, the normal
symmetric release procedures apply. When a signalling system is used without a
symmetric release possibility or a fault condition occurs, the following may
apply:
\- when MSC‑B receives a clear-forward signal from MSC‑A, it shall release the
radio resources;
\- in fault situation eg. machine malfunction or loss of the connection on
interface A, MSC‑B may send a clear-back signal to MSC‑A.
## 10.3 Handover control procedures MSC‑B (functional unit 3)
The procedures of functional unit 3 are given in form of SDL diagrams in
figure 42. To easily distinguish the interface concerned the messages received
or sent from this unit are prefixed with either \'MAP\' for a MAP message,
\'A\' for an A‑Interface message or \'I\' for an ISDN/PSTN message. The
procedure in functional unit 3 include:
i) handover from MSC‑A.
This case is initiated by MSC‑A, and includes allocation and establishment of
the new radio channel. The procedure is outlined in subclauses 7.1 and 7.2.
ii) intra-MSC handovers within the area controlled by MSC‑B.
This procedure is the same as that of i) in subclause 9.3, except that the
A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED is received by MSC‑B. After successful completion of the
intra-MSC handover, MSC-B shall notify MSC-A by sending an A-HANDOVER-
PERFORMED message.
iii) subsequent handover to another MSC (MSC‑A or MSC‑B\').
The initiation procedure is essentially the same as that of i) of subclause
9.3. The Handover Command to the MS is now generated by MSC‑B after the A-HO-
REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE is received from MSC‑A (via functional unit 4). The
procedure is terminated in MSC‑B when MSC‑B receives a terminate procedure
indication from functional unit 4.
Timers in MSC‑B.
The following procedures are supervised by timers in order to avoid a deadlock
when responses are not received or the procedures fail.
The following timers are defined:
> T201: this timer supervises the queuing time for a free channel. T201 is set
> by O&M
>
> T202: this timer supervises the time for handover completion for handover
> between BSSs in MSC‑B. If T202 expires, the radio path and the connection on
> interface B\' are released. T202 is set by O&M
>
> T204: this timer supervises the time between sending of address complete
> message to MSC‑A and receiving the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE from BSS-B on MSC‑B.
> This timer also supervises the time between issuing the handover command to
> the MS and receiving the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response from MSC‑A, for a
> subsequent handover. In the case of a handover without circuit connection
> between MSC‑A and MSC‑B this timer supervises the time between issuing the
> A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to the MSC‑A and receiving the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE
> from BSS-B on MSC‑B. If the timer expires, then any new radio channel is
> released. T204 is set by O&M
>
> T210: this timer is used to supervise the time for establishing a circuit
> connection from MSC‑A to MSC‑B. When T210 expires, the allocated channel in
> MSC‑B is released. T210 is set by O&M. This timer is not started when MSC‑A
> explicitly indicates that no handover number is needed;
>
> T211: this timer is used to control the time between requesting a subsequent
> handover (A-HO-REQUEST to the MSC‑A) and receiving the response from MSC‑A
> (A-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE/A-HO-FAILURE). If T211 expires, the existing
> connection with the MS is maintained. T211 is set by O&M.
## 10.4 MAP procedures MSC‑B (functional unit 4)
The MAP procedures for handover are defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [12]. They
include:
\- procedures for basic handover;
\- procedures for subsequent handover;
\- procedures for obtaining the handover number from the VLR.
These procedures are outlined in clause 7.
## 10.5 Interworking between Handover control procedures and MAP procedures in
MSC‑B
The interworking between the Handover control procedures and the MAP
procedures for handover is defined in 3GPP TS 29.010 [8]. It includes:
\- interworking at basic handover completion;
\- interworking at subsequent handover initiation.
This interworking is not described in the present document.
## 10.6 Compatibility with GSM Phase 1
If the MSC‑B accepts an Inter-MSC handover procedure according to Phase 2 MAP
and BSSMAP protocols while using a Phase 1 BSSMAP protocol towards BSS-B,
MSC‑B has to perform the protocol interworking.
The same holds if a Phase 1 MAP protocol is requested on the E-interface and
MSC‑B uses a Phase 2 BSSMAP protocol towards BSS-B.
# 11 Detailed procedures in 3G_MSC‑A
For detailed procedures in MSC‑A at handover within the GSM network, please
see clause 9 \"Detailed procedures in MSC‑A\".
## 11.1 RNC/BSC/3G_MSC and UE/MS/3G_MSC procedures in 3G_MSC‑A (functional
unit 1)
The handover/relocation procedures in this functional unit consist of:
i) signalling between the UE/MS and the 3G_MSC;
ii) signalling between the RNS/BSS and the 3G_MSC for access management.
## 11.2 Call control procedures 3G_MSC‑A (functional unit 2)
The call control procedures related to handover/relocation in 3G_MSC‑A can be
divided into two functional entities:
\- the first entity is the call control procedure as part of the normal
interworking between the PSTN/ISDN and the PLMN/UTRAN; for an UE/MS
originating call 3G_MSC‑A is the originating exchange, for an UE/MS
terminating call 3G_MSC‑A is the destination exchange;
  * the second entity is the call control procedure for the connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B in case of a handover/relocation from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B. For this call control procedure the following applies.
Call set-up:
\- the connection to 3G_MSC‑B is set up by procedures relevant to the
signalling system used in the PSTN/ISDN to which 3G_MSC‑A is connected. The
call is set up by using the Handover Number received from 3G_MSC‑B as part of
the MAP procedure;
\- the call set-up direction will always be from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B, even
when the call was originally established by the UE/MS. Functional unit 2 (see
figure 5) should therefore keep information on call set-up direction in order
to be able to interpret correctly any clearing signals (see below);
\- the unit should indicate the address complete condition to functional unit
3 and through-connect without awaiting the answer signal from 3G_MSC‑B. This
applies also to signalling systems where address complete signals are not
supported. In such cases an artificial address complete is established by
functional unit 2.
Call clearing:
\- call clearing consists of two parts: after handover/relocation, clearing of
the RNS-UE/MS or BSS-UE/MS connection and clearing of the inter-3G_MSC
connection. If a request to release the call is generated by the network while
the UE/MS is re-tuning from one RNS/BSS to another RNS/BSS, then 3G_MSC‑A
shall begin clearing the call to the network and queue the call release to the
UE/MS until the UE/MS has resumed communication. This includes the case when
3G_MSC‑B and/or 3G_MSC‑B\' are involved;
\- the MAP procedures are used to transfer information between 3G_MSC‑B and
3G_MSC‑A in order to maintain full call control within 3G_MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑A
determines, based on information received from 3G_MSC‑B, the appropriate
signals (according to 3GPP TS 24.008 [10]) to be sent to the UE/MS, and sends
this information to 3G_MSC‑B;
\- when 3G_MSC‑A clears the call to the UE/MS it also clears the call control
functions in 3G_MSC‑B and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release
the MAP resources in 3G_MSC‑B. The clearing of the connection is by procedures
relevant to the signalling system in the PSTN/ISDN to which 3G_MSC‑A is
connected;
\- when the Signalling System no 7 ISDN User Part is used, the normal
symmetric release procedures apply on both the connection to the fixed network
and to 3G_MSC‑B;
\- when a signalling system is used without a symmetric release possibility,
some notice should be given to the clear-forward and clear-back procedures;
\- for UE/MS terminating calls the following conditions apply on clear-forward
and clear-back:
\- when a clear-forward signal is received on interface B\' (see figure 4),
3G_MSC‑A clears the circuit to 3G_MSC‑B by normal clear-forward procedures;
\- when a clear-back signal is received from 3G_MSC‑B, 3G_MSC‑A starts normal
clear-back procedures towards the fixed network (interface B\') and sends the
clear-forward signal on interface B\'\' in order to clear the connection with
3G_MSC‑B.
NOTE 1: This case corresponds to a fault situation.
\- for UE/MS originated calls the following applies:
\- when 3G_MSC‑A receives a clear-back signal from 3G_MSC‑B, this signal must
be interpreted as indicating a clear-forward condition. 3G_MSC‑A then clears
both the connection on interface B\' (see figure 4) and to 3G_MSC‑B by normal
clear-forward procedures;
NOTE 2: This case corresponds to a fault situation.
\- when 3G_MSC‑A receives a clear-back signal on interface B\', 3G_MSC‑A
should distinguish between national and international connections:
\- for international connections where the Q.118 [1] supervision is done in
the ISC, 3G_MSC‑A sends a clear-forward signal on both interface B\' to the
fixed network and interface B\'\' to 3G_MSC‑B;
\- for national connections or for international connections where the Q.118
[1] supervision is not done in the ISC, a timer is started according to
national practice for clear-back supervision and MSC‑A proceeds as follows:
i) if a clear-back signal is received from 3G_MSC‑B, 3G_MSC‑A interprets this
as indicating a clear-forward condition and proceeds by clearing the
connections on interface B\' and to 3G_MSC‑B by normal clear-forward
procedures;
ii) if the timer expires, 3G_MSC‑A proceeds by normal clear-forward of the
connections on interface B\' and to 3G_MSC‑B.
## 11.3 Handover/Relocation control procedures 3G_MSC‑A (functional unit 3)
The procedures of functional unit 3 are given in terms of SDL diagrams in
figure 43. To easily distinguish the interface concerned the messages received
or sent from this unit are prefixed with either \'MAP\' for a MAP message,
\'A\' for an A-Interface message, \'I\' for an ISDN/PSTN message or \'Iu\' for
an Iu-message.
The procedures of functional unit 3 include:
i) initiation. The initiation condition is shown by the signal Iu-RELOCATION-
REQUIRED or A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED;
The diagram also includes queuing when there is no channel available. Calls
for which handover/relocation has been initiated should be queued with
priority higher than normal calls. They should have lower priority than
emergency calls.
ii) handover/relocation of calls within the area controlled by 3G_MSC‑A, i.e.
handover/relocation case i);
In the handover/relocation from RNS-A/BSS-A to RNS-B/BSS-B 3G_MSC‑A controls
the procedures on both the previous and the new radio channel, using signals
Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST/A-HANDOVER-REQUEST and Iu-RELOCATION-COMMAND/A-HANDOVER-
COMMAND. The handover/relocation procedure is completed when Iu-RELOCATION-
COMPLETE/A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE is received. If this signal is not received
(expiry of timer T102, T302, T502 or T702), the radio path and the connection
on interface B\' are released.
For handover/relocation devices with three-party capabilities the device is
first set up so that all interfaces Iu\'/A\', Iu\'\'/A\'\' and B\' are
connected (illustrated by the signal \'set up handover device\'). This is done
when the Relocation Command is sent to serving RNS or Handover Command is sent
to the serving BSS. The device is connected in its final position (i.e.
Iu\'\'/ A\'\' to B\' for case ii)) (illustrated by the signal \'connect
handover device\') when Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE/A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE is
received.
iii) relocation to 3G_MSC‑B. This procedure is the one described in subclauses
8.3.1 and 8.3.2. For handover/relocation devices with three-party capabilities
the device is set-up when 3G_MSC‑A sends the Relocation Command to the UE,
i.e. the interfaces Iu\', B\' and B\'\' are then connected. The device is
connected in its final position (i.e. B\' to B\'\') when the successful
procedure indication is received from functional unit 4;
iv) UMTS to GSM handover to MSC‑B. This procedure is the one described in
subclauses 8.1.1 and 8.1.2. For handover/relocation devices with three-party
capabilities the device is set-up when 3G_MSC‑A sends the Relocation Command
to the serving RNS, i.e. the interfaces Iu\', B\' and B\'\' are then
connected. The device is connected in its final position (i.e. B\' to B\'\')
when the successful procedure indication is received from functional unit 4;
v) GSM to UMTS handover to 3G_MSC‑B. This procedure is the one described in
subclauses 8.2.1 and 8.2.2. For handover/relocation devices with three-party
capabilities the device is set-up when MSC‑A sends the Handover Command to the
serving BSS , i.e. the interfaces A\', B\' and B\'\' are then connected. The
device is connected in its final position (i.e. B\' to B\'\') when the
successful procedure indication is received from functional unit 4;
vi) subsequent relocation from 3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A. The procedure is
described in subclauses 8.3.3.1 and 8.3.4.1. When a relocation to 3G_MSC‑A
indication is received from functional unit 4, the handover/relocation device
is set up so that interfaces B\', B\'\' and Iu\' are connected (for devices
with three-party capabilities). When Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE is received, the
device is connected in its final position (i.e. B\' to Iu\');
If Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE is not received (expiry of timer T704), the
handover/relocation device releases interface Iu\', B\' and B\'\'.
vii) subsequent GSM to UMTS handover from MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A. The procedure is
described in subclauses 8.2.3.1 and 8.2.4.1. When a handover to 3G_MSC‑A
indication is received from functional unit 4, the handover device is set up
so that interfaces B\', B\'\' and A\' are connected (for handover devices with
three-party capabilities). When Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE is received, the device
is connected in its final position (i.e. B\' to Iu\');
If Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE is not received (expiry of timer T504), the device
releases interface Iu\', B\' and B\'\'.
viii) subsequent UMTS to GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑A. The procedure is
described in clauses 8.1.3.1 and 8.1.4.1. When a handover to MSC‑A indication
is received from functional unit 4, the handover device is set up so that
interfaces B\', B\'\' and Iu\' are connected (for handover devices with three-
party capabilities). When A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE is received, the device is
connected in its final position (i.e. B\' to A\');
If A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE is not received (expiry of timer T304), the device
releases interface A\', B\' and B\'\'.
ix) subsequent relocation from 3G_MSC‑B to a third 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑B\'). The
procedure is described in subclauses 8.3.4.2 and 8.3.5.2. The
handover/relocation device is set up in its initial position, (i.e.
interconnection of interfaces B\', B\'\' and B\'\'\') when the connection to
3G_MSC‑B\' has been established. 3G_MSC‑B is informed via functional unit 4
that the connection has been established and that the procedure on the radio
path can be initiated. The device is connected in its final position (i.e. B\'
to B\'\'\') when a successful procedure indication is received from functional
unit 4. 3G_MSC‑B is informed that all procedures in 3G_MSC‑B can be terminated
(illustrated by the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response). The device returns to the
state where B\' and B\'\' are connected if the subsequent relocation procedure
fails;
x) subsequent UMTS to GSM handover from 3G_MSC‑B to a third MSC (MSC‑B\'). The
procedure is described in subclauses 8.1.3.2 and 8.1.4.2. The
handover/relocation device is set up in its initial position, (i.e.
interconnection of interfaces B\', B\'\' and B\'\'\') when the connection to
MSC‑B\' has been established. 3G_MSC‑B is informed via functional unit 4 that
the connection has been established and that the procedure on the radio path
can be initiated. The device is connected in its final position (i.e. B\' to
B\'\'\') when a successful procedure indication is received from functional
unit 4. 3G_MSC‑B is informed that all procedures in 3G_MSC‑B can be terminated
(illustrated by the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response). The device returns to the
state where B\' and B\'\' are connected if the subsequent UMTS to GSM handover
procedure fails;
xi) subsequent GSM to UMTS handover from MSC‑B to a third MSC (3G_MSC‑B\').
The procedure is described in subclauses 8.2.3.2 and 8.2.4.2. The
handover/relocation device is set up in its initial position, (i.e.
interconnection of interfaces B\', B\'\' and B\'\'\') when the connection to
3G_MSC‑B\' has been established. MSC‑B is informed via functional unit 4 that
the connection has been established and that the procedure on the radio path
can be initiated. The device is connected in its final position (i.e. B\' to
B\'\'\') when a successful procedure indication is received from functional
unit 4. MSC‑B is informed that all procedures in MSC‑B can be terminated
(illustrated by the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response). The device returns to the
state where B\' and B\'\' are connected if the subsequent GSM to UMTS handover
procedure fails.
NOTE: The procedures ii), vi) and vii) may be applied also in case of a
handover/relocation to an RNC which is controlled by 3G_MSC-A by using the
"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation" option.
Timers in 3G_MSC‑A.
The procedures are supervised by timers in order to avoid a deadlock when
responses are not received or the procedures fail.
The following timers are defined for SRNS Relocation:
> T701: this timer supervises the queuing time for a free channel for the
> relocation inside UMTS. If T701 expires, a no channel indication is
> generated and 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the relocation as described in
> subclause 6.2.3. T701 is set by O&M
>
> T702: this timer supervises the time for relocation completion for
> relocation between RNSs in 3G_MSC‑A. T702 is set by O&M
>
> T703: this timer supervises the time between issuing an Iu-RELOCATION-
> COMMAND from 3G_MSC‑A and receiving a successful procedure indication from
> 3G_MSC‑B. This timer also supervises the time between sending an IU-
> RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to 3G_MSC‑B and receiving a successful
> procedure indication from 3G_MSC‑B\'. If T703 expires, the relocation
> procedure is terminated. T703 is set by O&M
>
> T704: this timer supervises the time between sending of an IU-RELOCATION-

> released. T704 is set by O&M.
The following timers are defined for UMTS to GSM handover:
> T301: this timer supervises the queuing time for a free channel for the UMTS
> to GSM handover. If T301 expires, a no channel indication is generated and
> 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the handover as described in subclause 6.2.3. T301
> is set by O&M
>
> T302: this timer supervises the time for UMTS to GSM handover completion for

>
> T303: this timer supervises the time between issuing an Iu-RELOCATION-
> COMMAND from 3G_MSC‑A and receiving a successful procedure indication from
> MSC‑B. This timer also supervises the time between sending an A-HO-REQUEST-
> ACKNOWLEDGE to MSC‑B and receiving a successful procedure indication from
> MSC‑B\'. If T303 expires, the UMTS to GSM handover procedure is terminated.
> T303 is set by O&M
>
> T304: this timer supervises the time between sending of an A-HO-REQUEST-

> 3G_MSC‑A. If the timer expires, the new radio channel is released. T304 is
> set by O&M.
The following timers are defined for GSM to UMTS handover:
> T501: this timer supervises the queuing time for a free channel for the GSM
> to UMTS handover. If T501 expires, a no channel indication is generated and
> 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the handover as described in subclause 6.2.3. T501
> is set by O&M
>
> T502: this timer supervises the time for GSM to UMTS handover completion for
> handover from BSS to RNS in 3G_MSC‑A. T502 is set by O&M
>
> T503: this timer supervises the time between issuing an A-HANDOVER-COMMAND
> from MSC‑A and receiving a successful procedure indication from 3G_MSC‑B.
> This timer also supervises the time between sending an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-
> ACKNOWLEDGE to 3G_MSC‑B and receiving a successful procedure indication from
> 3G_MSC‑B\'. If T503 expires, the GSM to UMTS handover procedure is
> terminated. T503 is set by O&M
>
> T504: this timer supervises the time between sending of an A-HANDOVER-
> REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to 3G_MSC‑B and receiving the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE
> from RNS-B on 3G_MSC‑A. If the timer expires, the new radio channel is
> released. T504 is set by O&M.
## 11.4 MAP procedures in 3G_MSC‑A (functional unit 4)
The MAP procedures for handover/relocation are defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [12].
They include:
\- procedures for basic handover/relocation;
\- procedures for subsequent handover/relocation.
These procedures are as outlined in clause 8.
## 11.5 Interworking between Handover/Relocation control procedures and MAP
procedures in 3G_MSC‑A
The interworking between the Handover/Relocation control procedures and the
MAP procedures for handover/relocation is defined in 3GPP TS 29.010 [8]. It
includes:
\- interworking at basic handover/relocation initiation;
\- interworking at subsequent handover/relocation completion.
This interworking is not described in the present document.
## 11.6 Compatibility with GSM Phase 1
Interworking with the GSM Phase 1 is not supported.
## 11.7 Protocol interworking
If the 3G_MSC‑A initiates a basic inter-MSC UMTS to GSM handover procedure
according to MAP and BSSMAP protocols while using a RANAP protocol towards
RNS-A, 3G_MSC‑A has to perform the protocol interworking between RANAP on the
Iu-Interface and encapsulated BSSMAP on the E-interface.
The same holds if 3G_MSC‑A accepts a subsequent inter-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS
handover back to 3G_MSC-A while using a RANAP protocol towards RNS-B.
# 12 Detailed procedures in 3G_MSC‑B
For detailed procedures in 3G_MSC‑B at handover within the GSM network, please
see clause 10 \'Detailed procedures in MSC‑B\'.
## 12.1 RNC/BSC/3G_MSC (UE/MS/RNC/BSC) procedures in 3G_MSC‑B (functional unit
1)
The Intra and Inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation procedures in this functional
unit consist of:
i) signalling between the UE/MS and the 3G_MSC;
ii) signalling between the RNS/BSS and the 3G_MSC for access management.
Signals exchanged with functional unit 3 are indicated in subclause 12.3.
## 12.2 Call control procedures 3G_MSC‑B (functional unit 2)
These procedures relate to the call control in 3G_MSC‑B of the \"3G_MSC
handover/relocation\" connection with 3G_MSC‑A. For these procedures the
following apply:
Call set-up:
\- the connection is set up by 3G_MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑B should provide, if possible,
the following backward signals:
\- signals indicating unsuccessful call set-up and, if possible, the cause of
call failure;
\- address complete signal;
\- answer signal (see note).
NOTE: The answer signal is not related to answering by the UE/MS and it has no
meaning in the 3G_MSC handover/relocation procedure between 3G_MSC‑A and
3G_MSC‑B. But after successful handover/relocation or successful subsequent
channel assignment using a circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B
this signal is needed for bringing the connection in the answered state in the
intermediate PSTN/ISDN exchanges.
\- there will be no indication that the call applies to a 3G_MSC
handover/relocation. This information has to be derived from the UE/MS
Handover Number received during call set-up in relation to the earlier MAP-
PREPARE-HANDOVER request/MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response procedure between
3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B.
Call clearing:
\- call clearing consists of two parts after inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation:
clearing of the RNS-UE/MS or the BSS-UE/MS connection and clearing of the
inter-3G_MSC connection, these cases are only applicable to calls successfully
handed over or relocated. If a request to release the call is generated by the
network while the UE/MS is re-tuning from one RNS/BSS to another RNS/BSS, then
3G_MSC‑B shall begin clearing the call to the network and queue the call
release to the UE/MS until the UE/MS has resumed communication;
\- the MAP is used to transfer information between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B in
order to make it possible for 3G_MSC‑B to send the appropriate signals to the
UE/MS, specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [10], and still leave the call control to
3G_MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑A normally initiates release of the connection between
3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. Exceptionally 3G_MSC‑B is allowed to release the
connection if no MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response is received, or if the 3G_MSC
Handover/Relocation is to be aborted;
\- when the Signalling System no 7 ISDN User Part is used, the normal
symmetric release procedures apply. When a signalling system is used without a
symmetric release possibility or a fault condition occurs, the following may
apply:
\- when 3G_MSC‑B receives a clear-forward signal from 3G_MSC‑A, it shall
release the radio resources;
\- in fault situation e.g. machine malfunction or loss of the connection on
interface Iu or interface A, 3G_MSC‑B may send a clear-back signal to
3G_MSC‑A.
## 12.3 Handover/Relocation control procedures in 3G_MSC‑B (functional unit 3)
The procedures of functional unit 3 are given in form of SDL diagrams in
figure 44. To easily distinguish the interface concerned the messages received
or sent from this unit are prefixed with either \'MAP\' for a MAP message,
\'A\' for an A‑Interface message, \'Iu\' for an Iu-Interface message or \'I\'
for an ISDN/PSTN message. The procedure in functional unit 3 include:
i) inter 3G_MSC handover/relocation from 3G_MSC‑A;
This case is initiated by 3G_MSC‑A, and includes allocation and establishment
of the new radio resources. The procedure is outlined in subclauses 8.1.1 and
8.1.2. for UMTS to GSM handover, clauses 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 for GSM to UMTS
handover and subclauses 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 for relocation.
ii) intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handovers within the area controlled by 3G_MSC‑B;
This procedure is the same as that of ii) in clause 11.3, except that the Iu-
RELOCATION-REQUIRED is received by 3G_MSC‑B. After successful completion of
the intra-3G_MSC handover, 3G_MSC-B shall notify 3G_MSC-A by sending an
A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.
iii) intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handovers within the area controlled by
3G_MSC‑B;
This procedure is the same as that of ii) in subclause 11.3, except that the
A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED is received by 3G_MSC‑B. After successful completion of
the intra-3G_MSC handover, 3G_MSC-B shall notify 3G_MSC-A by sending an
A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.
iv) intra-3G_MSC SRNS Relocation within the area controlled by 3G_MSC‑B;
This procedure is the same as that of ii) in subclause 11.3, except that the
Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED is received by 3G_MSC‑B. After successful completion of
the intra-3G_MSC SRNS relocation, if security algorithms have been changed,
3G_MSC-B shall notify 3G_MSC-A by sending an A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED or an Iu-
LOCATION-REPORT message, depending on the access network protocol used
encapsulated on the E-interface (see subclauses 4.4.1 and 6.2.3).
v) subsequent handover/relocation to another 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑A or 3G_MSC‑B\');
The initiation procedure is essentially the same as that of i) of subclause
11.3. The Handover Command to the BSS or the Relocation Command to the RNS is
now generated by 3G_MSC‑B after the A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE or Iu-RELOCATION-
REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE is received from 3G_MSC‑A (via functional unit 4). The
procedure is terminated in 3G_MSC‑B when 3G_MSC‑B receives a terminate
procedure indication from functional unit 4.
NOTE: The procedures iii), iv) and, in case of a subsequent handover back to
3G_MSC-A, the procedure v) may be applied also in case of a
handover/relocation to an RNC which is controlled by 3G_MSC-B or 3G_MSC-A
respectively by using the \"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation\"
option.
Timers in 3G_MSC‑B.
The following procedures are supervised by timers in order to avoid a deadlock
when responses are not received or the procedures fail.
The following timers are defined for UMTS to GSM handover:
> T401: this timer supervises the queuing time for a free channel. T401 is set
> by O&M
>
> T402: this timer supervises the time for handover completion for UMTS to GSM

The following timers are defined for GSM to UMTS handover:
> T601: this timer supervises the queuing time for a free radio resource. T601
> is set by O&M
>
> T602: this timer supervises the time for handover completion for GSM to UMTS

> T604 is set by O&M
>
> T610: this timer is used to supervise the time for establishing a circuit

> expires, the existing connection with the UE/MS is maintained. T611 is set
> by O&M.
The following timers are defined for SRNS Relocation:
> T801: this timer supervises the queuing time for a free radio resource. T801
> is set by O&M
>
> T802: this timer supervises the time for relocation completion for

>
> T804: this timer supervises the time between sending of address complete

## 12.4 MAP procedures in 3G_MSC‑B (functional unit 4)
The MAP procedures for handover/relocation are defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [12].
They include:
\- procedures for basic handover/relocation;
\- procedures for subsequent handover/relocation;
\- procedures for obtaining the handover number from the VLR.
These procedures are outlined in clause 8.
## 12.5 Interworking between Handover/Relocation control procedures and MAP
procedures in 3G_MSC‑B
The interworking between the Handover/Relocation control procedures and the
MAP procedures for handover/relocation is defined in 3GPP TS 29.010 [8]. It
includes:
\- interworking at basic handover/relocation completion;
\- interworking at subsequent handover/relocation initiation.
This interworking is not described in the present document.
## 12.6 Compatibility with GSM Phase 1
GSM phase 1 is not supported.
## 12.7 Protocol interworking
If the 3G_MSC‑B accepts an Inter-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover procedure
according to MAP and BSSMAP protocols while using a RANAP protocol towards
RNS-B, 3G_MSC‑B has to perform the protocol interworking between RANAP on the
Iu-Interface and encapsulated BSSMAP on the E-interface.
The same holds if 3G_MSC‑B initiates a subsequent inter-MSC UMTS to GSM
handover while using a RANAP protocol towards RNS-A.
If during the supervision, i.e. while the UE/MS is not in the area of MSC-A or
3G_MSC-A, the protocol used encapsulated on the E-interface and the protocol
used between 3G_MSC-B and the serving BSS or RNS are different, then 3G_MSC‑B
has to perform the protocol interworking between BSSAP and RANAP.
NOTE: The two protocols are different, e.g., after an inter-MSC GSM to UMTS
inter-system handover, or after an inter-MSC SRNS relocation to 3G_MSC-B
followed by a subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B UMTS to GSM inter-system handover.
## 12.8 Interactions between handover/relocation control procedures and other
RANAP procedures
This clause gives an overview of the procedures that shall be followed when
handover/relocation control procedures interact with other RANAP procedures on
3G_MSC-B.
### 12.8.1 Interactions between handover/relocation control procedures and the
security mode procedure
#### 12.8.1.1 Intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation
A security mode control procedure may be requested by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A after an
Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS handover or Inter-MSC SRNS relocation. If RNS-A replies
with an Iu-SECURITY-MODE-REJECT containing the cause value \'Relocation
Triggered\' due to an already initiated Intra-3G_MSC-B UMTS to GSM handover or
Intra-3G_MSC-BSRNS relocation, the 3G_MSC-B shall not forward the result of
the security mode control procedure to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, but wait for the
outcome of the handover/relocation procedure. If the relocation procedure is
completed successfully, the 3G_MSC-B shall reattempt the security mode control
procedure towards the new serving radio network. If the handover procedure is
completed successfully, the 3G_MSC-B shall reattempt the cipher mode control
procedure towards the new serving radio network, if ciphering is to be
activated.
NOTE: The message flow is shown in the perspective of 3G_MSC-B. It is assumed
that RNS-A has sent the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED before it received the Iu-
SECURITY-MODE-COMMAND.
Figure 35a: Collision between a subsequent Intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation
and a security mode control procedure i): successful handover/relocation
If the handover/relocation procedure is unsuccessful and the UE is still
served by RNS-A, the 3G_MSC-B shall reattempt the security mode procedure
towards RNS-A.
NOTE: The message flow is shown in the perspective of 3G_MSC-B. It is assumed
that RNS-A has sent the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED before it received the Iu-
SECURITY-MODE-COMMAND.
Figure 35b: Collision between a subsequent Intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation
and a security mode control procedure ii): unsuccessful handover/relocation
#### 12.8.1.2 Subsequent Inter-MSC handover/relocation
A security mode control procedure may be requested by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A after an
Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS handover or Inter-MSC SRNS relocation. If RNS-A replies
with an Iu-SECURITY-MODE-REJECT containing the cause value \'Relocation
Triggered\' due to an already initiated subsequent Inter-MSC
handover/relocation, the 3G_MSC-B shall not forward the result of the security
mode procedure to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, but wait for the outcome of the
handover/relocation procedure. If the subsequent Inter-MSC relocation
procedure is completed successfully, the 3G_MSC-A shall reattempt the security
mode control procedure towards the new serving radio network or
MSC-B\'/3G_MSC-B\'. If the subsequent Inter-MSC handover procedure is
completed successfully, the MSC-A/3G_MSC-A shall reattempt the cipher mode
control procedure towards the new serving radio network or MSC-B\'/3G_MSC-B,
if ciphering is to be activated.
NOTE: The message flow is shown in the perspective of 3G_MSC-B. It is assumed
that RNS-A has sent the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED before it received the Iu-
SECURITY-MODE-COMMAND.
Figure 35ba: Collision between a subsequent Inter-MSC handover/relocation and
a security mode control procedure i): successful handover/relocation
If the subsequent Inter-MSC handover/relocation procedure is unsuccessful and
the UE is still served by 3G_MSC-B, the 3G_MSC-B shall reattempt the security
mode procedure towards RNS-A.
NOTE: The message flow is shown in the perspective of 3G_MSC-B. It is assumed
that RNS-A has sent the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED before it received the Iu-
SECURITY-MODE-COMMAND.

and a security mode control procedure ii): unsuccessful handover/relocation
### 12.8.2 Interactions between handover/relocation control procedures and the
RAB assignment procedure
#### 12.8.2.1 Intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation
A subsequent channel assignment procedure may be requested by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A
after an Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS handover or Inter-MSC SRNS relocation without
circuit connection (see subclauses 13.2 and 13.4). If RNS-A replies with an
Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE containing the cause value \'Relocation Triggered\'
due to an already initiated Intra-3G_MSC-B UMTS to GSM handover or
Intra-3G_MSC-B SRNS relocation, the 3G_MSC-B shall not forward the result of
the RAB assignment procedure to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, but wait for the outcome of
the handover/relocation procedure. If the handover/relocation procedure is
completed successfully, the 3G_MSC-B shall construct an A-ASSIGNMENT-COMPLETE
or Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE message, dependent on the encapsulated protocol
used on the E-interface, and forward this message to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the
MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response.

### 12.8.3 Interactions between directed retry handover procedures and the RAB
assignment procedure
#### 12.8.3.1 Intra-3G_MSC-B directed retry handover
For a description of the directed retry handover procedure see subclause 14.3.
A subsequent channel assignment procedure may be requested by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A
after an Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS handover or Inter-MSC SRNS relocation without
circuit connection (see subclauses 13.2 and 13.4). If RNS-A replies with an
Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE containing the cause value \'Directed Retry\' and
the subsequent Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED indicates that an Intra-3G_MSC-B
directed retry handover is required, the 3G_MSC-B shall not forward the result
of the RAB assignment procedure to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, but wait for the outcome of
the directed retry handover procedure. If the directed retry handover
procedure is completed successfully, the 3G_MSC-B shall construct an
A-ASSIGNMENT-COMPLETE or Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE message, dependent on the
encapsulated protocol used on the E-interface, and forward this message to
MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response.
Figure 35e: Interaction between a RAB assignment procedure and a subsequent
Intra-3G_MSC-B directed retry handover i): successful directed retry handover
If the directed retry handover procedure is unsuccessful and the UE is still
served by RNS-A, the 3G_MSC-B may optionally take one of a number of actions:
i) send an Iu-RELOCATION-PREPARATION FAILURE to RNS-A, if an Iu-RELOCATION-
COMMAND has not already been sent. Additionally 3G_MSC-B may retry the
assignment procedure to RNS-A;
ii) retry the assignment procedure to RNS-A, if the failure message was
returned from RNS-A. This option is additional to those for normal handover;
iii) construct an A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message containing the cause value
\'Radio interface failure, reversion to old channel\' or Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-
RESPONSE message containing the cause value \'Failure In The Radio Interface
Procedure\', dependent on the encapsulated protocol used on the E-interface,
and forward this message to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A.
#### 12.8.3.2 Subsequent Inter-MSC directed retry handover
A subsequent channel assignment procedure may be requested by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A
after an Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS handover or SRNS relocation without circuit
connection (see subclauses 13.2 and 13.4). If RNS-A replies with an Iu-RAB-
ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE containing the cause value \'Directed Retry\' and the
subsequent Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED indicates that a subsequent Inter-MSC
directed retry handover is required, the 3G_MSC-B shall not forward the result
of the RAB Assignment procedure to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, but wait for the outcome of
the directed retry handover procedure. 3G_MSC-B shall continue with the
directed retry handover procedure as described in subclause 14.3.
Figure 35f: Interaction between a RAB assignment procedure and a subsequent
Inter-MSC directed retry handover i): successful directed retry handover
If the directed retry handover procedure is unsuccessful and the UE is still

actions:
i) send an Iu-RELOCATION-PREPARATION FAILURE to RNS-A, if an Iu-RELOCATION-
COMMAND has not already been sen. Additionally 3G_MSC-B may retry the
assignment procedure to RNS-A t;

# 13 Subsequent channel assignment using a circuit connection between MSC‑A
and MSC‑B
## 13.1 GSM handover
If a circuit connection has to be set up (for example for a Mobile Originated
or Mobile Terminated Call Establishment) after an Inter-MSC handover without
circuit connection, MSC‑A shall request a Handover Number using a MAP‑PREPARE-
HANDOVER request, containing the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST, on the established MAP
connection. For speech calls, MSC-A shall also include the Iu Supported Codecs
List to be used by MSC-B for subsequent intra-MSC-B intersystem handover to
UMTS and intra-MSC-B SRNS relocation. If MSC‑B indicates to MSC‑B and to MSC‑A
that at least one of two procedures assignment or Handover Number allocation
can not be completed, then MSC‑A shall terminate the circuit establishment
attempt. The existing connection to the MS shall be maintained, if possible.
Upon receipt of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request MSC‑B shall perform the
requested assignment operation towards the BSS. In addition it shall retrieve
a Handover Number from VLR-B. If a failure occurs in the assignment or
Handover Number allocation then it shall be reflected in the MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER response that at least one of these two procedures has not been
completed (i.e. either by a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER result with the assignment
procedure outcome and the Handover Number allocation outcome or by a MAP-
PREPARE-HANDOVER error).
When MSC‑A receives a successful MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response it shall
establish a circuit connection to MSC‑B by using the appropriate network
supported procedures. In figure 36 this is indicated by the IAM (Initial
Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message). MSC‑B shall also send the
Answer message if appropriate to the signalling system. Upon receipt of the
Answer MSC‑A shall consider the circuit connection establishment phase
complete. If a failure occurs during the cirucit establishment phase then the
existing connection to the MS shall be maintained, if possible.
NOTE: Can be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.

## 13.2 UMTS to GSM handover
If a circuit connection has to be set up (for example for a Mobile Originated
or Mobile Terminated Call Establishment) after an Inter-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM
handover without circuit connection, 3G_MSC‑A shall request a Handover Number
using a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request, containing the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST, on
the established MAP connection. For speech calls, 3G_MSC-A shall also include
the Iu Supported Codecs List to be used by MSC-B for subsequent intra-MSC-B
intersystem handover to UMTS and intra-MSC-B SRNS relocation. If MSC‑B
indicates to MSC‑B and to 3G_MSC‑A that at least one of two procedures
assignment or Handover Number allocation can not be completed, then 3G_MSC‑A
shall terminate the circuit establishment attempt. The existing connection to
the UE/MS shall be maintained, if possible.
Upon receipt of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request MSC‑B shall perform the
requested assignment operation towards the BSS. In addition it shall retrieve
a Handover Number from VLR-B. If a failure occurs in the assignment or
Handover Number allocation then it shall be reflected in the MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER response that at least one of these two procedures has not been
completed (i.e. either by a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER result with the assignment
procedure outcome and the Handover Number allocation outcome or by a MAP-
PREPARE-HANDOVER error).
When 3G_MSC‑A receives a successful MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, it shall
establish a circuit connection to MSC‑B by using the appropriate network
supported procedures. In figure 37 this is indicated by the IAM (Initial
Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message). MSC‑B shall also send the
Answer message if appropriate to the signalling system. Upon receipt of the
Answer 3G_MSC‑A shall consider the circuit connection establishment phase
complete. If a failure occurs during the circuit establishment phase then the
existing connection to the UE/MS shall be maintained, if possible.

## 13.3 GSM to UMTS handover
If a circuit connection has to be set up (for example for a Mobile Originated

handover without circuit connection, MSC‑A shall request a Handover Number
using a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request, containing the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST, on
the established MAP connection. If 3G_MSC‑B indicates to 3G_MSC‑B and to MSC‑A
that at least one of two procedures assignment or Handover Number allocation
can not be completed, then MSC‑A shall terminate the circuit establishment
attempt. The existing connection to the UE/MS shall be maintained, if
possible.
Upon receipt of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request 3G_MSC‑B shall perform the
requested assignment operation towards the RNS. In addition it shall retrieve
a Handover Number from VLR-B. If a failure occurs in the assignment or
Handover Number allocation then it shall be reflected in the MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER response that at least one of these two procedures has not been
completed (i.e. either by a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER result with the assignment
procedure outcome and the Handover Number allocation outcome or by a MAP-
PREPARE-HANDOVER error).
For speech calls, if 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-
Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select a codec from the Iu Supported
Codecs List, generate associated RAB parameters and connect a transcoder. If
the Iu Supported Codecs List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the
selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall
select the appropriate default speech codec.
For an assignment in UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-B shall also generate a NAS Synch
Indicator for the Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message. If the Iu Supported
Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B and 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of
codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then the Iu Selected codec shall
be indicated in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent from 3G_MSC‑B to
MSC‑A.
When MSC‑A receives a successful MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, it shall
establish a circuit connection to 3G_MSC‑B by using the appropriate network
supported procedures. In figure 38 this is indicated by the IAM (Initial
Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message). 3G_MSC‑B shall also send
the Answer message if appropriate to the signalling system. Upon receipt of
the Answer MSC‑A shall consider the circuit connection establishment phase
complete. If a failure occurs during the circuit establishment phase then the
existing connection to the UE/MS shall be maintained, if possible.

## 13.4 SRNS Relocation
### 13.4.1 Without circuit connection
If a circuit connection has to be set up (for example for a Mobile Originated
or Mobile Terminated Call Establishment) after an Inter-3G_MSC relocation
without circuit connection, 3G_MSC‑A shall request a Handover Number using a
MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request, containing the IU-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST, on the
established MAP connection.
For speech calls, 3G_MSC-A shall include the Iu Supported Codecs List in the
MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. 3G_MSC‑A shall configure the RANAP RAB
parameters according to the appropriate default speech codec.
Alternatively, if 3G_MSC-B is known to support the use of the Iu Supported
Codecs List, 3G_MSC-A may configure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the
preferred codec and indicate this to 3G_MSC-B by including the RAB
configuration indicator in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. The decision to
use this option is based on internal configuration information in 3G_MSC-A.
For an assignment in UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC‑A shall also include the NAS Synch
Indicator in the Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST.
If 3G_MSC‑B indicates to 3G_MSC‑B and to 3G_MSC‑A that at least one of two
procedures (RAB) assignment or Handover Number allocation can not be
completed, then 3G_MSC‑A shall terminate the circuit establishment attempt.
The existing connection to the UE shall be maintained, if possible.
Upon receipt of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request, 3G_MSC‑B shall perform the
requested RAB assignment operation towards the RNS. In addition it shall
retrieve a Handover Number from VLR-B.
For speech calls, if 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-
Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu
Supported Codecs List and connect a transcoder. If the Iu Supported Codecs
List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codec
based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select the appropriate
default speech codec.
3G_MSC-B shall reconfigure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the Iu
Selected codec:
\- if the RAB configuration indicator is included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER
request and the codec selected by 3G_MSC-B is different from the preferred
codec; or
\- if the RAB configuration indicator is not included in the MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER request and the codec selected by 3G_MSC-B is different from the
appropriate default speech codec.
Additionally, for an assignment in UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-B shall include the
NAS Synch Indicator for the Iu Selected codec in the Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-
REQUEST. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B and 3G_MSC-B
supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then
the Iu Selected codec shall be indicated in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response,
sent from 3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A.
If a failure occurs in the RAB assignment or Handover Number allocation then
it shall be reflected in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response that at least one
of these two procedures has not been completed (i.e. either by a MAP-PREPARE-
HANDOVER result with the RAB assignment procedure outcome and the Handover
Number allocation outcome or by a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER error).
When 3G_MSC‑A receives a successful MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, it shall
establish a circuit connection to 3G_MSC‑B by using the appropriate network
supported procedures. In figure 39 this is indicated by the IAM (Initial
Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message). 3G_MSC‑B shall also send
the Answer message if appropriate to the signalling system. Upon receipt of
the Answer 3G_MSC‑A shall consider the circuit connection establishment phase
complete. If a failure occurs during the circuit establishment phase then the
existing connection to the UE shall be maintained, if possible.
### 13.4.2 With circuit connection (Optional functionality)
If 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B support the optional supplementary service Multicall
(See 3GPP TS 23.135 [17]), 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B shall have the following
functionality additionally to the description in subclause 13.4.1.
A new circuit connection shall be able to set up (for example for a new Mobile
Originated or a new Mobile Terminated Call Establishment) after an
Inter-3G_MSC relocation with one or several circuit connections. The
procedures for the establishment of the additional circuit connection in
3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B are the same as that described in subclause 13.4.1.

# 14 Directed retry handover
Editor\'s Note: [Directed retry in the cases of SRNS relocation is FFS]
## 14.1 GSM handover
The directed retry procedure allows the network to select the optimum cell for
the Mobile Station. The process of directed retry involves the assignment of a
Mobile Station to a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell. This
process is triggered by the assignment procedures, as described in 3GPP TS
48.008 [5], and employs internal or external handover procedures as described
in clauses 6 and 7. The successful procedure for a directed retry is as shown
in figure 40 and as described below.
If during the assignment phase, as represented by the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST
message, a handover becomes necessary, due to either radio conditions or
congestion, then the Mobile Station may be handed over to a different cell.
When the decision has been made to handover the MS the BSS-A may send an
A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message, indicating \'directed retry\', before sending
the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message to MSC‑A, indicating \'directed retry\'.
However BSS-A may alternatively send the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message,
indicating \'directed retry\', without sending the A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE
message. Other cause values may be used instead of \"Directed Retry\" in the
A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, this will allow the MSC to take different actions
dependent on the received cause. Upon receipt of the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED
message from BSS-A, then MSC‑A shall initiate the handover as described in
clauses 6 and 7. No resources shall be cleared in the MSC‑A or BSS-A for this
connection.
After receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B the assignment
procedure shall be considered to be complete and the resources on BSS-A shall
be cleared.
Figure 40: Example of a Directed Retry Intra-MSC Handover Procedure
If a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-
FAILURE returned from BSS-A or BSS-B, then MSC‑A will terminate the handover
to BSS-B. Under these conditions MSC‑A may optionally take one of a number of
actions:
i) retry the handover to the same cell;
ii) select the next cell from the list contained in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED
message and attempt a handover to the new cell;
iii) send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A, if an A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has
not already been sent. Additionally MSC-A may retry the assignment procedure
to BSS-A;
iv) retry the assignment procedure to BSS-A, if the failure message was
returned from BSS-A. This option is additional to those for normal handover;
v) Clear the complete call.
The procedures for Inter-MSC handover are also applicable to the directed
retry process. If an Inter-MSC handover is necessary then the assignment
process should be considered to have completed successfully upon receipt of
the A-HO-COMPLETE included in the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request.
## 14.2 GSM to UMTS handover
The directed retry procedure allows the network to select the optimum cell for
the UE/MS. The process of directed retry involves the assignment of a UE/MS to
a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell. This process is
triggered by the assignment procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 48.008 [5],
and employs internal or external GSM to UMTS handover procedures as described
in subclauses 6.2.2 and 8.2. The successful procedure for a directed retry in
case of an intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover is as shown in figure 40a and as
described below.
If during the assignment phase, as represented by the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST
message, a GSM to UMTS handover becomes necessary, due to radio conditions,
congestion or inability to provide the requested bearer service in GSM, then
the UE/MS may be handed over to a UMTS cell. If the requested bearer service
cannot be provided in GSM, 3G_MSC-A shall indicate in the A-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST
message that handover to UMTS should be performed. When the decision has been
made to handover the UE/MS the BSS-A may send an A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message,
indicating \'directed retry\', before sending the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message
to 3G_MSC‑A, indicating \'directed retry\'. However BSS-A may alternatively
send the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, indicating \'directed retry\', without
sending the A-ASSIGNMENT-FAILURE message. Other cause values may be used
instead of \"Directed Retry\" in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, this will
allow the 3G_MSC to take different actions dependent on the received cause.
Upon receipt of the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from BSS-A, then 3G_MSC‑A
shall initiate the GSM to UMTS handover as described in subclauses 6.2.2 and
8.2. No resources shall be cleared in the 3G_MSC‑A or BSS-A for this
connection.
After receipt of the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B the assignment
procedure shall be considered to be complete and the resources on BSS-A shall
be cleared.
Figure 40a: Example of a Directed Retry Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS Handover
Procedure
If a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-
FAILURE returned from BSS-A or Iu-RELOCATION FAILURE from RNS-B then 3G_MSC‑A
will terminate the GSM to UMTS handover to RNS-B. Under these conditions
3G_MSC‑A may optionally take one of a number of actions:
i) send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A, if an A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has
not already been sent. Additionally 3G_MSC-A may retry the assignment
procedure to BSS-A;
ii) retry the assignment procedure to BSS-A, if the failure message was
returned from BSS-A. This option is additional to those for normal handover;
iii) Clear the complete call.
The procedures for Inter-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover are also applicable to
the directed retry process. If an Inter-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handover is
necessary then the assignment process should be considered to have completed
successfully upon receipt of the A-HO-COMPLETE included in the MAP-SEND-END-
SIGNAL request.
## 14.3 UMTS to GSM handover
The directed retry procedure allows the network to select the optimum cell for
the UE/MS. The process of directed retry involves the assignment of a UE/MS to
a radio channel on a cell other than the serving cell. This process is
triggered by the assignment procedures, as described in 3GPP TS 25.413 [1],
and employs UMTS to GSM handover procedures as described in subclauses 6.2.1
and 8.1. The successful procedure for a directed retry in case of an
intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover is as shown in figure 40b and as described
below.
If during the assignment phase, as represented by the Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-
REQUEST message, a UMTS to GSM handover becomes necessary, due to either radio
conditions. congestion or network preference, then the UE/MS may be handed
over to a GSM cell. If the handover to GSM is required due to network
preference, 3G_MSC-A shall indicate in the Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-REQUEST message
that handover to GSM should be performed. When the decision has been made to
handover the UE/MS the RNS-A shall send an Iu-RAB-ASSIGNMENT-RESPONSE message,
indicating \'directed retry\', before sending the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED
message to 3G_MSC‑A, indicating \'directed retry\'. Other cause values may be
used instead of \"Directed Retry\" in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message, this
will allow the 3G_MSC to take different actions dependent on the received
cause. Upon receipt of the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message from RNS-A, then
3G_MSC‑A shall initiate the UMTS to GSM handover as described in subclauses
6.2.1 and 8.1. No resources shall be cleared in the 3G_MSC‑A or RNS-A for this
connection.
After receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B the assignment
procedure shall be considered to be complete and the resources on RNS-A shall
be cleared.
Figure 40b: Example of a Directed Retry Intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM Handover
Procedure
If a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example Iu-RELOCATION
FAILURE returned from RNS-A or A-HANDOVER-FAILURE from BSS-B then 3G_MSC‑A
will terminate the UMTS to GSM handover to BSS-B. Under these conditions
3G_MSC‑A may optionally take one of a number of actions:
i) send an Iu-RELOCATION-PREPARATION FAILURE to RNS-A, if an Iu-RELOCATION-
COMMAND has not already been sent. Additionally 3G_MSC-A may retry the
assignment procedure to RNS-A;
ii) retry the assignment procedure to RNS-A, if the failure message was
returned from RNS-A. This option is additional to those for normal handover;
iii) Clear the complete call.
The procedures for Inter-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover are also applicable to
the directed retry process. If an Inter-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover is
necessary then the assignment process should be considered to have completed
successfully upon receipt of the A-HO-COMPLETE included in the MAP-SEND-END-
SIGNAL request.
# 15 SDL diagrams
NOTE 1: The message primitive names used in the SDL diagrams and message flows
in the present document do not represent the actual messages specified in the
GSM or 3GPP stage 3 technical specifications. The primitive names are only
intended to be indicative of their use in the present document.
SDL Annotation.
The following conventions and abbreviations have been used in the SDLs. Text
included in \'[]\' is used to indicate either, the BSSMAP message (as defined
in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7]) included in the message, or the transport of a Handover
Number.
When traversing the following SDLs it may be possible that resources appear to
be released repeatedly, however these operations are only executed once on
their first occurrence. Furthermore it maybe that certain messages cannot, in
practice, be received in particular states, after specific events have taken
place. In general both of the above cases are obvious. This approach has been
adopted (in line with other GSM Technical Specifications) in order to reduce
the complexity of the SDLs and improve clarity, without reducing the quality
of the functional description.
The following abbreviations have been used in the SDLs:
