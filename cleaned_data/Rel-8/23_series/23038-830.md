# 4 SMS Data Coding Scheme
The TP-Data-Coding-Scheme field, defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 [4], indicates the
data coding scheme of the TP‑UD field, and may indicate a message class. Any
reserved codings shall be assumed to be the GSM 7 bit default alphabet (the
same as codepoint 00000000) by a receiving entity. The octet is used according
to a coding group which is indicated in bits 7..4. The octet is then coded as
follows:
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Coding Group Bits | Use of bits 3..0 | | | | | 7..4 | | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | 00xx | General Data Coding indication\ | | | Bits 5..0 indicate the following:\ | | | \ | | | Bit 5, if set to 0, indicates the text is | | | uncompressed\ | | | Bit 5, if set to 1, indicates the text is | | | compressed using the compression algorithm | | | defined in 3GPP TS 23.042 [13]\ | | | \ | | | Bit 4, if set to 0, indicates that bits 1 to 0 | | | are reserved and have no message class meaning | | | | | | Bit 4, if set to 1, indicates that bits 1 to 0 | | | have a message class meaning::\ | | | \ | | | Bit 1 Bit 0 Message Class\ | | | 0 0 Class 0\ | | | 0 1 Class 1 Default meaning: ME-specific.\ | | | 1 0 Class 2 (U)SIM specific message\ | | | 1 1 Class 3 Default meaning: TE specific (see | | | 3GPP TS 27.005 [8])\ | | | \ | | | Bits 3 and 2 indicate the character set being | | | used, as follows :\ | | | Bit 3 Bit2 Character set:\ | | | 0 0 GSM 7 bit default alphabet\ | | | 0 1 8 bit data\ | | | 1 0 UCS2 (16bit) [10]\ | | | 1 1 Reserved\ | | | \ | | | NOTE: The special case of bits 7..0 being 0000 | | | 0000 indicates the GSM 7 bit default alphabet | | | with no message class | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | 01xx | Message Marked for Automatic Deletion Group | | | | | | This group can be used by the SM originator to | | | mark the message ( stored in the ME or (U)SIM ) | | | for deletion after reading irrespective of the | | | message class. | | | | | | The way the ME will process this deletion | | | should be manufacturer specific but shall be | | | done without the intervention of the End User | | | or the targeted application. The mobile | | | manufacturer may optionally provide a means for | | | the user to prevent this automatic deletion. | | | | | | Bit 5..0 are coded exactly the same as Group | | | 00xx | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | 1000..1011 | Reserved coding groups | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | 1100 | Message Waiting Indication Group: Discard | | | Message | | | | | | The specification for this group is exactly the | | | same as for Group 1101, except that: | | | | | | - after presenting an indication and storing | | | the status, the ME may discard the contents | | | of the message. | | | | | | The ME shall be able to receive, process and | | | acknowledge messages in this group, | | | irrespective of memory availability for other | | | types of short message. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | 1101 | Message Waiting Indication Group: Store Message | | | | | | This Group defines an indication to be provided | | | to the user about the status of types of | | | message waiting on systems connected to the | | | GSM/UMTS PLMN. The ME should present this | | | indication as an icon on the screen, or other | | | MMI indication. The ME shall update the | | | contents of the Message Waiting Indication | | | Status on the SIM (see 3GPP TS 51.011 [18]) | | | or USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) when | | | present or otherwise should store the status in | | | the ME. In case there are multiple records of | | | EF~MWIS~ this information shall be stored | | | within the first record. The contents of the | | | Message Waiting Indication Status should | | | control the ME indicator. For each indication | | | supported, the mobile may provide storage for | | | the Origination Address. The ME may take note | | | of the Origination Address for messages in this | | | group and group 1100. | | | | | | Text included in the user data is coded in the | | | GSM 7 bit default alphabet.\ | | | Where a message is received with bits 7..4 set | | | to 1101, the mobile shall store the text of the | | | SMS message in addition to setting the | | | indication. The indication setting should take | | | place irrespective of memory availability to | | | store the short message. | | | | | | Bits 3 indicates Indication Sense:\ | | | \ | | | Bit 3\ | | | 0 Set Indication Inactive\ | | | 1 Set Indication Active\ | | | \ | | | Bit 2 is reserved, and set to 0\ | | | \ | | | Bit 1 Bit 0 Indication Type:\ | | | 0 0 Voicemail Message Waiting\ | | | 0 1 Fax Message Waiting\ | | | 1 0 Electronic Mail Message Waiting\ | | | 1 1 Other Message Waiting*\ | | | \ | | | * Mobile manufacturers may implement the | | | \"Other Message Waiting\" indication as an | | | additional indication without specifying the | | | meaning. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | 1110 | Message Waiting Indication Group: Store | | | Message\ | | | \ | | | The coding of bits 3..0 and functionality of | | | this feature are the same as for the Message | | | Waiting Indication Group above, (bits 7..4 set | | | to 1101) with the exception that the text | | | included in the user data is coded in the | | | uncompressed UCS2 character set. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | 1111 | Data coding/message class\ | | | \ | | | Bit 3 is reserved, set to 0.\ | | | \ | | | Bit 2 Message coding:\ | | | 0 GSM 7 bit default alphabet\ | | | 1 8-bit data\ | | | \ | | | Bit 1 Bit 0 Message Class:\ | | | 0 0 Class 0\ | | | 0 1 Class 1 default meaning: ME-specific.\ | | | 1 0 Class 2 (U)SIM-specific message.\ | | | 1 1 Class 3 default meaning: TE specific (see | | | 3GPP TS 27.005 [8]) | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
GSM 7 bit default alphabet indicates that the TP-UD is coded from the GSM 7
bit default alphabet given in clause 6.2.1. When this character set is used,
the characters of the message are packed in octets as shown in clause
6.1.2.1.1, and the message can consist of up to 160 characters. The GSM 7 bit
default alphabet shall be supported by all MSs and SCs offering the service.
If the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension mechanism is used then the number
of displayable characters will reduce by one for every instance where the GSM
7 bit default alphabet extension table is used. 8-bit data indicates that the
TP-UD has user-defined coding, and the message can consist of up to 140
octets.
UCS2 character set indicates that the TP-UD has a UCS2 [10] coded message, and
the message can consist of up to 140 octets, i.e. up to 70 UCS2 characters.
The General notes specified in clause 6.1.1 override any contrary
specification in UCS2, so for example even in UCS2 a \ character will
cause the MS to return to the beginning of the current line and overwrite any
existing text with the characters which follow the \.
When a message is compressed, the TP-UD consists of the GSM 7 bit default
alphabet or UCS2 character set compressed message, and the compressed message
itself can consist of up to 140 octets in total.
When a mobile terminated message is class 0 and the MS has the capability of
displaying short messages, the MS shall display the message immediately and
send an acknowledgement to the SC when the message has successfully reached
the MS irrespective of whether there is memory available in the (U)SIM or ME.
The message shall not be automatically stored in the (U)SIM or ME.
The ME may make provision through MMI for the user to selectively prevent the
message from being displayed immediately.
If the ME is incapable of displaying short messages or if the immediate
display of the message has been disabled through MMI then the ME shall treat
the short message as though there was no message class, i.e. it will ignore
bits 0 and 1 in the TP-DCS and normal rules for memory capacity exceeded shall
apply.
When a mobile terminated message is Class 1, the MS shall send an
acknowledgement to the SC when the message has successfully reached the MS and
can be stored. The MS shall normally store the message in the ME by default,
if that is possible, but otherwise the message may be stored elsewhere, e.g.
in the (U)SIM. The user may be able to override the default meaning and select
their own routing.
When a mobile terminated message is Class 2 ((U)SIM-specific), an MS shall
ensure that the message has been transferred to the SMS data field in the
(U)SIM before sending an acknowledgement to the SC. The MS shall return a
\"protocol error, unspecified\" error message (see 3GPP TS 24.011 [6]) if the
short message cannot be stored in the (U)SIM and there is other short message
storage available at the MS. If all the short message storage at the MS is
already in use, the MS shall return \"memory capacity exceeded\". This
behaviour applies in all cases except for an MS supporting (U)SIM Application
Toolkit when the Protocol Identifier (TP-PID) of the mobile terminated message
is set to \"(U)SIM Data download\" (see 3GPP TS 23.040 [4]).
When a mobile terminated message is Class 3, the MS shall send an
acknowledgement to the SC when the message has successfully reached the MS and
can be stored, irrespectively of whether the MS supports an SMS interface to a
TE, and without waiting for the message to be transferred to the TE. Thus the
acknowledgement to the SC of a TE-specific message does not imply that the
message has reached the TE. Class 3 messages shall normally be transferred to
the TE when the TE requests \"TE‑specific\" messages (see 3GPP TS 27.005 [8]).
The user may be able to override the default meaning and select their own
routing.
The message class codes may also be used for mobile originated messages, to
provide an indication to the destination SME of how the message was handled at
the MS.
The MS will not interpret reserved or unsupported values but shall store them
as received. The SC may reject messages with a Data Coding Scheme containing a
reserved value or one which is not supported.
# 5 CBS Data Coding Scheme
The CBS Data Coding Scheme indicates the intended handling of the message at
the MS, the character set/coding, and the language (when applicable). Any
reserved codings shall be assumed to be the GSM 7 bit default alphabet (the
same as codepoint 00001111) by a receiving entity. The octet is used according
to a coding group which is indicated in bits 7..4. The octet is then coded as
follows:
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | Coding Group | Use of bits 3..0 | | | | | Bits | | | | | | 7..4 | | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | 0000 | Language using the GSM 7 bit default alphabet | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | Bits 3..0 indicate the language: | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 0000 German | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 0001 English | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 0010 Italian | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 0011 French | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 0100 Spanish | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 0101 Dutch | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 0110 Swedish | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 0111 Danish | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 1000 Portuguese | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 1001 Finnish | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 1010 Norwegian | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 1011 Greek | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 1100 Turkish | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 1101 Hungarian | | | | | | 1110 Polish | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | | 1111 Language unspecified | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | 0001 | 0000 GSM 7 bit default alphabet; message preceded by | | | language indication. | | | | | | The first 3 characters of the message are a | | | two-character representation of the language encoded | | | according to ISO 639 [12], followed by a CR | | | character. The CR character is then followed by 90 | | | characters of text. | | | | | | 0001 UCS2; message preceded by language indication | | | | | | The message starts with a two GSM 7-bit default | | | alphabet character representation of the language | | | encoded according to ISO 639 [12]. This is padded | | | to the octet boundary with two bits set to 0 and | | | then followed by 40 characters of UCS2-encoded | | | message. | | | | | | An MS not supporting UCS2 coding will present the | | | two character language identifier followed by | | | improperly interpreted user data. | | | | | | 0010..1111 Reserved | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+ | 0010.. | 0000 Czech | | | | | | 0001 Hebrew | | | | | | 0010 Arabic | | | | | | 0011 Russian | | | | | | 0100 Icelandic | | | | | | 0101..1111 Reserved for other languages using the | | | GSM 7 bit

TE specific | | | | | | (see 3GPP TS 27.005 [8]) | +--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
These codings may also be used for USSD and MMI/display purposes.
The message length specified in this subclause is not applicable for UTRAN and
E-UTRAN but only applicable for GSM.
See 3GPP TS 24.090 [11] for specific coding values applicable to USSD for MS
originated USSD messages and MS terminated USSD messages. USSD messages using
the default alphabet are coded with the GSM 7-bit default alphabet given in
clause 6.2.1. The message can then consist of up to 182 user characters.
Cell Broadcast messages using the default alphabet are coded with the GSM
7-bit default alphabet given in clause 6.2.1. The message then consists of 93
user characters.
If the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension mechanism is used then the number
of displayable characters will reduce by one for every instance where the GSM
7 bit default alphabet extension table is usedCell Broadcast messages using
8-bit data have user-defined coding, and will be 82 octets in length.
UCS2 character set indicates that the message is coded in UCS2 [10]. The
General notes specified in clause 6.1.1 override any contrary specification in
UCS2, so for example even in UCS2 a \ character will cause the MS to
return to the beginning of the current line and overwrite any existing text
with the characters which follow the \. Cell Broadcast messages encoded in
UCS2 consist of 41 characters.
Class 1 and Class 2 messages may be routed by the ME to user-defined
destinations, but the user may override any default meaning and select their
own routing.
Class 3 messages will normally be selected for transfer to a TE, in cases
where a ME supports an SMS/CBS interface to a TE, and the TE requests \"TE-
specific\" cell broadcast messages (see 3GPP TS 27.005 [8]). The user may be
able to override the default meaning and select their own routing.
Messages with a User Data Header Structure are encoded as described in 3GPP TS
23.040 [4] for SMS, in subclauses 3.10 and 9.2.3.24.
The use of Cell Broadcast DCS values for messages with a User Data Header
structure implies that the 82-bytes CB payload has a User Data Header
structure.
The CBS message information field will contain the IEs as described in 3GPP TS
23.040. The concatenation IEs will not be used, as CB concatenation will rely
in that case on the existing CB mechanism. Note that IEs that cannot be split
and that IEs that are too large to fit in one CB segment cannot be transmitted
using this mechanism. Also, some IEs as defined for SMS are not applicable for
CB:

# 6 Individual parameters
## 6.1 General principles
### 6.1.1 General notes
Except where otherwise indicated, the following shall apply to all character
sets:
1: The characters marked \"1)\" are not used but are displayed as a space.
2: The characters of this set, when displayed, should approximate to the
appearance of the relevant characters specified in ISO 1073 [16]and the
relevant national standards.
3: Control characters:
* * *
Code Meaning LF Line feed: Any characters following LF which are to be
displayed shall be presented as the next line of the message, commencing with
the first character position. CR Carriage return: Any characters following CR
which are to be displayed shall be presented as the current line of the
message, commencing with the first character position. SP Space character.
* * *
4: The display of characters within a message is achieved by taking each
character in turn and placing it in the next available space from left to
right and top to bottom.
### 6.1.2 Character packing
#### 6.1.2.1 SMS Packing
##### 6.1.2.1.1 Packing of 7-bit characters
If a character number α is noted in the following way:
b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1
αa αb αc αd αe αf αg
The packing of the 7-bitscharacters in octets is done by completing the octets
with zeros on the left.
For examples, packing: α
\- one character in one octet:
\- bits number:
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 1g
\- two characters in two octets:
\- bits number:
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
2g 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 1g
0 0 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f
\- three characters in three octets:
\- bits number:
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
2g 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 1g
3f 3g 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f
0 0 0 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e
\- seven characters in seven octets:
\- bits number:
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
2g 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 1g
3f 3g 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f
4e 4f 4g 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e
5d 5e 5f 5g 4a 4b 4c 4d
6c 6d 6e 6f 6g 5a 5b 5c
7b 7c 7d 7e 7f 7g 6a 6b
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7a
\- eight characters in seven octets:
\- bits number:
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
2g 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 1g
3f 3g 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f
4e 4f 4g 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e
5d 5e 5f 5g 4a 4b 4c 4d
6c 6d 6e 6f 6g 5a 5b 5c
7b 7c 7d 7e 7f 7g 6a 6b
8a 8b 8c 8d 8e 8f 8g 7a
The bit number zero is always transmitted first.
Therefore, in 140 octets, it is possible to pack (140x8)/7=160 characters.
#### 6.1.2.2 CBS Packing
##### 6.1.2.2.1 Packing of 7-bit characters
If a character number α is noted in the following way:
b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1
αa αb αc αd αe αf αg
the packing of the 7-bits characters in octets is done as follows:
bit number
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Therefore, in 82 octets, it is possible to pack (82x8)/7 = 93.7, that is 93
characters. The 5 remaining bits are set to zero as stated above.

The bit number zero is always transmitted first.
Therefore, in 160 octets, is it possible to pack (160*8)/7 = 182.8, that is
182 characters. The remaining 6 bits are set to zero as stated above.
Packing of 7 bit characters in USSD strings is done in the same way as for SMS
(clause 6.1.2.1). The character stream is bit padded to octet boundary with
binary zeroes as shown above.
If the total number of characters to be sent equals (8n‑1) where n=1,2,3 etc.
then there are 7 spare bits at the end of the message. To avoid the situation
where the receiving entity confuses 7 binary zero pad bits as the @ character,
the carriage return or \ character (defined in clause 6.1.1) shall be used
for padding in this situation, just as for Cell Broadcast.
If \ is intended to be the last character and the message (including the
wanted \) ends on an octet boundary, then another \ must be added
together with a padding bit 0. The receiving entity will perform the carriage
return function twice, but this will not result in misoperation as the
definition of \ in clause 6.1.1 is identical to the definition of
\\.
The receiving entity shall remove the final \ character where the message
ends on an octet boundary with \ as the last character.
## 6.2 Character sets and coding
This section provides list of character sets and codings to be supported by
SMS, CBS and USSD. Implementation of the GSM 7 bit default alphabet is
mandatory. Support of other character sets is optional.
It should be noted that support of Latin and non-Latin languages by GSM 7 bit
default alphabet is limited. It is therefore essential to introduce UCS 2
character set in mobile stations, SCs and systems handling SMSs, CBSs and
USSDs.

#### 6.2.1.2 National Language Identifier
##### 6.2.1.2.1 Introduction
The national language tables are used for adding the special characters of
certain languages that cannot be expressed using the GSM default 7 bit
alphabet.
The principle is to use the National Language Identifier to indicate to a
receiving entity that the message has been encoded using a national language
table. Both single shift and locking shift mechanisms are defined.
The single shift mechanism, as defined in subclause 6.2.1.2.2, applies to a
single character and it replaces the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension
table defined in subclause 6.2.1.1 with a National Language Single Shift Table
(see subclause A.2).
The locking shift mechanism, as defined in subclause 6.2.1.2.3, applies
throughout the message, or the current segment in case of a concatenated
message, and it replaces the GSM 7 bit default alphabet defined in subclause
6.2.1 with a National Language Locking Shift Table (see subclause A.3) that
defines the whole character set needed for the language.
In case that several languages are used, which require different national
language tables, it is recommended to encode the message in UCS-2, however it
is possible to use both single shift and locking shift with the corresponding
tables in a single message.
Implementations based on older reference versions (so-called \"legacy
implementations\") will use the fallback mechanisms that are defined in the
earlier versions of the specification for handling of unknown characters.
##### 6.2.1.2.2 Single shift mechanism
In the case where single shift is not combined with locking shift, single
shift means that the receiving entity shall decode all characters in the
message (or the current segment in case of a concatenated message) using the
GSM 7 bit default alphabet unless the escape mechanism is used, i.e
\\, as defined in subclause 6.2.1.
The case where single shift and locking shift (which may be for the same or
different languages) are combined is described in subclause 6.2.1.2.3.
If the escape mechanism is used then instead of the GSM 7 bit default alphabet
extension table in subclause 6.2.1.1 the receiving entity shall decode the
subsequent character using the National Language Single Shift Table for the
indicated language in table 6.2.1.2.4.1. Each time a sending entity requires
to send a character from the National Language Single Shift Table the sending
entity shall encode this as \\, where the \ is
encoded using the indicated National Language Single Shift Table.
##### 6.2.1.2.3 Locking shift mechanism
Locking Shift means that the receiving entity shall decode all characters in
the message (or the current segment in case of a concatenated message) using
the National Language Locking Shift Table unless the escape mechanism is used.
i.e. \\, as defined in subclause 6.2.1.
If the escape mechanism is used and no National Language Single Shift Table is
indicated (see subclause 6.2.1.2.4), the receiving entity shall decode the
message (or the current segment in case of a concatenated message) using the
GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table as defined in subclause 6.2.1.1.
If the escape mechanism is used and a National Language Single Shift Table is
indicated (see subclause 6.2.1.2.4), the receiving entity shall decode the
message (or the current segment in case of a concatenated message) using the
National Language Single Shift Table as defined in subclause 6.2.1.2.2.
##### 6.2.1.2.4 National Language Identifier
A National Language Single Shift IE and a National Language Locking Shift IE
can be included in the TP User Data Header, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 [4].
The receiving entity shall decode using single shift or locking shift as
applicable for the language indicated in the National Language Identifier
within these IEs.
The National Language Identifier octet is encoded as shown in table
6.2.1.2.4.1.

##### 6.2.1.2.5 Processing of national language characters
When supporting a specific national language, the sending entity shall support
the encoding of messages using the corresponding National Language Identifier
defined in subclause 6.2.1.2.4.
The receiving entity should be able to decode messages using all National
Language Identifiers defined in subclause 6.2.1.2.4.
If a message is received, containing a National Language Identifier indicating
a reserved value or a value that is not supported by the receiving entity, the
receiving entity shall ignore the IE (see 3GPP TS 23.040 [4]) in which the
National Language Identifier was indicated.
The receiving entity shall be capable of processing both single shift and
locking shift within the same message.
It is an implementation option for the sending entity whether to use the
single shift mechanism, the locking shift mechanism or both.
NOTE 1: A message using the locking shift mechanism cannot make use of
characters from the GSM 7 bit Default Alphabet table unless such characters
are replicated in the National Language Locking Shift Table or (in the case of
locking shift and single shift), the National Language Single Shift table.
NOTE 2: Encoding of a message using the national locking shift mechanism is
not intended to be implemented until a formal request is issued by the
relevant national regulatory body. This is because a receiving entity not
supporting the relevant locking-shift decoding will present different
characters from the ones intended by the sending entity.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Guidelines for creating language tables
# B.1 Introduction
This annex provides guidelines for creating language tables.
It is recommended that the characters and their positions in the table are
checked by people fluent in the appropriate language, and preferably endorsed
by an appropriate responsible body.
It is recommended that character positions are carefully selected so that
receiving entities, which do not support the specific table, display symbols
(glyphs) similar to the wanted symbols (glyphs) as far as possible.
# B.2 Template for Single Shift Language Tables
The format and structure of the table below shall be used to document the
Language specific character codes used in the National Language selection
mechanism.
It is recommended that a National Language Single Shift Table includes the
characters represented in the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table (as
defined in subclause 6.2.1.1) in the same character position. This ensures the
availability of these characters in case when the single shift mechanism is
used.

the country is known).

###### ## Annex C (Informative): Example for locking shift and single shift
mechanisms
# C.1 Introduction
This annex gives an overview on how the national language extension mechanism
of the GSM 7 bit default alphabet works. This annex shows how a message with
an indication of the Turkish National Language Identifier is decoded, but the
same principles apply to other languages.
# C.2 Example of single shift
This example outlines the behaviour of both supporting and non-supporting
receiving entities where the Turkish National Language Single Shift Table is
indicated in the received message. In this example there is no locking shift
mechanism used in parallel.
A non-supporting receiving entity will ignore the National Language Single
Shift IE, and decode the message contents using the GSM 7 bit default alphabet
table defined in subclause 6.2.1, including possible escape characters to the
GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table specified in subclause 6.2.1.1. For
example the Turkish word \"Türkçe\" will be displayed as \"Türkce\".
A receiving entity that supports the Turkish National Language Single Shift
Table will detect a National Language Single Shift IE in a TP User Data
Header. This IE tells the receiving entity that the single shift mechanism is
used.
A supporting receiving entity will notice the language code, in this example
coded as \'0000 0001\', and therefore use the Turkish National Language Single
Shift Table defined in subclause A.2.1 instead of the GSM 7 bit default
alphabet extension table defined in subclause 6.2.1.
If the next character is any character except \, then the GSM 7 bit
default alphabet table is used for the decode. If the next character is
\ then the Turkish language specific table is used for the decode of
the one character that follows the \. This process will be repeated
until the end of the received message, or until the end of the current segment
of a concatenated message.
The Language selection at the start of a message takes 4 octets which
correspond to five 7 bit characters which reduces the maximum number of
characters per single message to 155.
Thereafter, the number of characters within that single message will be
dependent upon the number of times a character is used that is within the
National Language Single Shift Table.
Every character used from the National Language Single Shift Table will need
an additional character to identify the escape to the National Language Single
Shift Table. The available 155 character capacity of a single message will
therefore be reduced accordingly. This reduction of overall message length
also applies when using characters from the GSM 7 bit default alphabet
extension table (see subclause 6.2.1.1) when the National Language Single
Shift IE is not used.
# C.3 Example of locking shift
This example outlines the behaviour of both supporting and non-supporting
receiving entities where the Turkish National Language Locking Shift Table is
indicated in the received message.
A non-supporting receiving entity will ignore the National Language Locking
Shift IE, and decode the message contents using the GSM 7 bit default alphabet
defined in subclause 6.2.1, including possible escape characters to the GSM 7
bit default alphabet extensions specified in subclause 6.2.1.1.
A receiving entity that supports the scheme will detect a National Language
Locking Shift IE in a TP User Data Header. This IE tells the receiving entity
that the locking shift mechanism is used. If no National Language Single Shift
IE is indicated additionally to the National Language Locking Shift IE, then
the whole message is decoded using the National Language Locking Shift Table
defined for Turkish language in subclause 6.2.1.2.4.1.
If, in addition to the National Language Locking Shift IE (which may be for
Turkish or another language), a National Language Single Shift IE for the
Turkish language is indicated, then \ makes an exception to the use of
the National Language Locking Shift Table for the Turkish or another language.
In that case a character following \ is decoded using the National
Language Single Shift Table for the Turkish language, after which the use of
the National Language Locking Shift Table for the Turkish or another language
is resumed until the next \ or the end of the message is met.
The Language selection at the start of a message takes 4 octets which
corresponds to five 7 bit characters which reduces the maximum number of
characters per single message to 155, unless the National Language Single
Shift IE has also been included, in which case there is a further reduction of
3 octets making 7 octets in total, which corresponds to eight 7 bit
characters, which reduces the maximum number of characters per single message
to 152.
Thereafter, if the single shift mechanism is used additionally to the locking
shift mechanism, the number of characters within that single message will be
dependent upon the number of times a character is used that is within the
National Language Single Shift Table.
Every character in the National Language Single Shift Table will use an
additional character. The available 152 character single message length will
therefore be reduced accordingly. This reduction of overall message length
also applies when using characters from the GSM 7 bit default alphabet
extension table (see subclause 6.2.1.1) when the National Language Single
Shift IE is not used.
