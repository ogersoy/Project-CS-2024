# Introduction
To ensure competitiveness of the 3GPP systems in a time frame of the next 10
years and beyond, a long-term evolution of the 3GPP access technology needs to
be considered.
In particular, to enhance the capability of the 3GPP system to cope with the
rapid growth in IP data traffic, the packet-switched technology utilised
within 3G mobile networks requires further enhancement. A continued evolution
and optimisation of the system concept is also necessary in order to maintain
a competitive edge in terms of both performance and cost. Important parts of
such a long-term evolution include reduced latency, higher user data rates,
improved system capacity and coverage, and reduced overall cost for the
operator.
Additionally, it is expected that IP based 3GPP services will be provided
through various access technologies. A mechanism to support seamless mobility
between heterogeneous access networks, e.g. I-WLAN and 3GPP access systems, is
a useful feature for future network evolution.
In order to achieve this, an evolution or migration of the network
architecture, as well as an evolution of the radio interface, partly addressed
already by individual WIDs, should be considered.
Architectural considerations will include end-to-end systems aspects,
including core network aspects and the study of a variety of IP connectivity
access networks (e.g. fixed broadband access).
# 1 Scope
The objective of this feasibility study is to develop a framework for an
evolution or migration of the 3GPP system to a higher-data-rate, lower-
latency, packet-optimized system that supports, multiple RATs. The focus of
this work will be on the PS domain with the assumption that voice services are
supported in this domain.
**NOTE: This feasibility study has led into work items specifying LTE/SAE and
the contents of this study should be considered out of date.**
The main objectives are to address the following aspects:
1) Overall architecture impacts stemming from requirements coming out from
TSG-RAN\'s Study Item on Radio Evolution (see SP‑040915). The architectural
developments should take into account the targets for the evolution of the
radio-interface, e.g.:
i) whether there is a need for a modified network architecture and/or
different functional split between network nodes (compared to the current 3GPP
architecture);
ii) how to provide a very low latency (including C-plane) for the overall
network (including core network, radio access network and radio access
technology);
iii) how to provide the efficient support of the various types of services,
especially from the PS domain (e.g. Voice over IP, Presence).
2) Overall architecture impacts stemming from the work in SA1 on an All-IP
Network (AIPN) (see TS 22.258 [4]), e.g.:
i) support of a variety of different access systems (existing and future) and
access selection based on combinations of operator policies, user preferences
and access network conditions;
ii) how to realize improvements in basic system performance e.g. communication
delay, communication quality, connection set-up time, etc.;
iii) how to maintain the negotiated QoS across the whole system; in particular
to address inter-domain and inter-network interworking, and, QoS on the
network link to the Base Station site.
NOTE: Although used in the SA WG1 TS 22.258 [4], the All-IP Network (AIPN)
term is not used in the network architecture in this SAE TR as mapping between
the term AIPN used in SA1 and the evolved architecture is not deemed necessary
to progress the SAE work. Instead, the requirements on AIPN in TS 22.258 [4]
are treated as overall system requirements. Even though the AIPN includes an
evolved, IP based, core network and evolved IMS domain, the scope of this SAE
TR does not include the IMS domain aspects.
3) Overall architecture aspects of supporting mobility between heterogeneous
access networks, including service continuity. E.g.:
i) service continuity between I-WLAN and the 3GPP PS domain;
ii) how to support multiple radio access technologies and terminal mobility
between different radio access technologies;
iii) how to maintain and support the same capabilities of access control
(authentication, authorization), privacy and charging when moving between
different radio access technologies.
Migration aspects should be taken into account for the above, i.e. how to
migrate from the existing architecture.
In the course of conducting this feasibility study additional individual Work
Items may be identified and prepared to address certain aspects and to take
care of the respective specification work. The timelines of those Work Items
may or may not concur with the timeline of this feasibility study.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Mobility Management Entity (MME):** manages and stores UE context (for idle
state: UE/user identities, UE mobility state, user security parameters). It
generates temporary identities and allocates them to UEs. It checks the
authorization whether the UE may camp on the TA or on the PLMN. It also
authenticates the user.
**MME Pool Area: An MME Pool Area is defined as an area within which a UE may
be served without need to change the serving MME. An MME Pool Area is served
by one or more MMEs (\"pool of MMEs\") in parallel.**
**UPE Pool Area: A UPE Pool Area is defined as an area within which a UE may
be served without need to change the serving UPE. A UPE Pool Area is served by
one or more UPEs (\"pool of UPEs\") in parallel.**
**User Plane Entity (UPE):** terminates for idle state Ues the downlink data
path and triggers/initiates paging when downlink data arrive for the UE. It
manages and stores UE contexts, e.g. parameters of the IP bearer service or
network internal routing information. It performs replication of the user
traffic in case of interception.
It is FFS whether Charging Information for inter-operator accounting is in UPE
or in another functional block.
**Idle State:** is LTE_IDLE for SAE/LTE or PMM_IDLE for 2G/3G or URA_PCH,
which is FFS
**IP Service continuity:** IP service continuity is the capability of a system
to hide the impact of mobility events to the end user and the IP
application(s), i.e. the service can continue without user intervention or
special application support to mask the effects of a mobility event.
**Nomadic Terminal:** Terminal that does not have full mobile capabilities but
would normally be expected to roam between different points of attachment of
the network, both wireless and wired.
**Backward Handover:** the source RAN node initiates the handover, and
resources are prepared in the target RAN Nodes. Examples of this concept are
reported in TR 25.931 [16].
**Forward Handover:** The UE changes to the target RAN node without any
preparation in the network. Examples of this concept are reported in TR 25.931
[16].
**Trusted non-3GPP IP Access:** A non-3GPP IP Access Network is defined as a
"trusted non-3GPP IP Access Network" if the 3GPP EPC system chooses to trust
such non-3GPP IP access network. The 3GPP EPC system operator may choose to
trust the non-3GPP IP access network operated by the same or different
operators, e.g. based on business agreements.
Note that specific security mechanisms may be in place between the trusted
non-3GPP IP Access Network and the 3GPP EPC to avoid security threats. It is
assumed that an IPSec tunnel between the UE and the 3GPP EPC is not required.
On the contrary, an untrusted non-3GPP IP access is an IP access network where
3GPP network requires use of IPSec between the UE and the 3GPP network in
order to provide adequate security mechanism acceptable to 3GPP network
operator. An example of such untrusted non-3GPP IP access is WLAN and it is
made trusted in the Interworking WLAN specifications developed within 3GPP.

IASA Inter Access System Anchor
# 4 Architecture Baseline
## 4.1 Architecture starting point
This chapter describes the architecture baseline as the basis for further
evolving the architecture. The full view of Release 6 network architecture is
the reference logical architecture with some additions from Release 7 work.
The Release 7 work that is included in the baseline architecture is:
\- PCRF and related reference points.
Editors Note: It is FFS what other Release 7 work that may be added to the
baseline architecture
NOTE: For simplification reasons Gx+ and Rx+ is made explicit in the figure
but it should be clear that in Release 6 then the interfaces Gx/Rx and Go/Gq
are applicable towards the CRF and PDF respectively.
More specifically the feasibility study shall focus on evolving the PS and
I-WLAN architecture, functionalities and figure 4.1-1. Refer to TS 23.002 [3]
for further detailed description. The functional entities that are depicted in
figure 4.1-1 are those that are potentially impacted as a result of this
study, in relation to the reference points shown.
Editors Note: The interfaces and network entities related to CAMEL and LCS are
currently not shown in figure 4.1‑1.
Figure 4.1-1: Logical baseline architecture for 3GPP
## 4.2 Architecture for the evolved system -- non-roaming case
Figure 4.2‑1 depicts the base line high level architecture for the evolved
system.
Editor\'s note:
\- It is not the finalized architecture model for the evolved system. i.e. it
does not contain all functions/interfaces required, and some
functions/interfaces may be added, deleted or modified in the course of the
key issue discussions.
\- In this TR, a trusted non-3GPP IP access is also referred to as the
non-3GPP IP access, and an untrusted non-3GPP IP accesses are accommodated by
is also referred to as the WLAN 3GPP IP access.
Figure 4.2-1: Logical high level architecture for the evolved system
The location of the functions belonging to MME/UPE is dependent on RAN CN
function split table, i.e. it is FFS.
It is FFS whether there is an interface between UTRAN and evolved packet core.
The separation of MME/UPE into two separate entities is FFS.
Editor\'s Note: Additional Architecture diagram updates will be done following
concrete resolutions on the other key issues. The current figure above does
not intend to draw any conclusion regarding the functional grouping within the
Evolved Packet Core. The number of interfaces and their termination points may
change once the grouping and other key issues are resolved.
**3GPP Anchor**
The 3GPP Anchor is a functional entity that anchors the user plane for
mobility between the 2G/3G access system and the LTE access system.
**SAE Anchor**
The SAE Anchor is a functional entity that anchors the user plane for mobility
between 3GPP access systems and non-3GPP access systems.
Whether the 3GPP Anchor functional entity is co-located with the MME/UPE or
the SAE Anchor or both is FFS. I.e. it is FFS whether to standardize open
interfaces between the MME/UPE and the 3GPP Anchor and between the 3GPP Anchor
and the SAE Anchor.
NOTE 1: The Inter Access System Anchor (IASA) is indicated with a dotted box
in Figure 4.2-1, because it is used in several parts of this TR, including in
figures, to represent both the 3GPP Anchor and the SAE Anchor.
NOTE 2: It is FFS how to map SAE architecture for the non-roaming case in
Figure 4.2-1 to the roaming architectures in clause 4.3
**ePDG (evolved PDG)**
It comprises the functionality of a PDG according to 3GPP TS 23.234 [28];
modifications/extensions compared to PDG are FFS.
**Reference points**
**S1:** It provides access to Evolved RAN radio resources for the transport of
user plane and control plane traffic. The S1 reference point shall enable MME
and UPE separation and also deployments of a combined MME and UPE solution.
**S2a:** It provides the user plane with related control and mobility support
between trusted non 3GPP IP access and the SAE Anchor.
**S2b:** It provides the user plane with related control and mobility support
between ePDG and the SAE Anchor.
**S3:** It enables user and bearer information exchange for inter 3GPP access
system mobility in idle and/or active state. It is based on Gn reference point
as defined between SGSNs.\ \ User data forwarding for inter 3GPP access system
mobility in active state (FFS).
**S4:** It provides the user plane with related control and mobility support
between GPRS Core and the 3GPP Anchor and is based on Gn reference point as
defined between SGSN and GGSN.
**S5a:** It provides the user plane with related control and mobility support
between MME/UPE and 3GPP anchor.
It is FFS whether a standardized S5a exists or whether MME/UPE and 3GPP anchor
are combined into one entity.
**S5b** : It provides the user plane with related control and mobility support
between 3GPP anchor and SAE anchor. It is FFS whether a standardized S5b
exists or whether 3GPP anchor and SAE anchor are combined into one entity.
**S6:** It enables transfer of subscription and authentication data for
authenticating/authorizing user access to the evolved system (AAA interface).
**S7:** It provides transfer of (QoS) policy and charging rules from PCRF to
Policy and Charging Enforcement Point (PCEP).\ The allocation of the PCEP is
FFS.
**Sgi:** It is the reference point between the Inter AS Anchor and the packet
data network. Packet data network may be an operator external public or
private packet data network or an intra operator packet data network, e.g. for
provision of IMS services. This reference point corresponds to Gi and Wi
functionalities and supports any 3GPP and non-3GPP access systems.
Protocol assumption:
\- The interfaces between the SGSN in 2G/3G Core Network and the Evolved
Packet Core (EPC) shall be based on GTP protocol.
\- The interfaces between the SAE MME/UPE and the 2G/3G Core Network shall be
based on GTP protocol.
## 4.3 Architecture for the evolved system --roaming cases
Editor\'s note: It is not the finalized architecture model for the evolved
system. I.e. it does not contain all functions/interfaces required, and some
functions/interfaces may be added, deleted or modified in the course of the
key issue discussions.
Editor\'s note: The protocol assumed in each interfaces in the roaming cases
shall be inline with the protocol assumption in the non-roaming case.
### 4.3.1 Scenario 1: Evolved packet core in the Visited network -- Evolved
packet core in the Home network
In this clause it is considered the high level target roaming architecture in
case both the visited and the home networks are evolved Packet Core networks.
Migration routes to this target roaming architecture are FFS. Two alternative
architectures are shown, depending on whether UE traffic has to be routed to
the HPLMN or not. It is FFS whether the two alternatives can be used in
parallel by a UE, e.g. when only a part of the user\'s traffic has to be
routed to the HPLMN.
In case UE traffic is routed to the home network, the SAE architecture is
depicted in figure 4.3‑1.
Editor\'s note: The update in clause 4.2 at SA2#52 on showing the split of the
IASA into two functional entities, namely a 3GPP anchor and SAE anchor,
requires the following figure to be updated. Whether the anchors are going to
be separated is FFS. In particular, although the Home IASA is illustrated in
the HPLMN, it is still an open issue whether the SAE anchor is located in the
VPLMN. It is FFS how the above changes impact the SAE roaming architecture
depicted below.
Figure 4.3-1: SAE Roaming architecture -- Home routed traffic
For home routed user traffic the Inter AS Anchor is located in the HPLMN. Due
to this reason, an interface between the Visited 3GPP Anchor and Home EPC is
needed. This interface is referred to as S8.
The vPCRF is located in the VPLMN, while hPCRF is in the HPLMN.
Usage of S6, S8 and S9 for providing visited network with static/dynamic
policies is FFS.
The 3GPP anchor, which anchors user plane for mobility between the 2G/3G
access system and the LTE access system, is located in the VPLMN.
Note: It is FFS what is the functionality of the Home Inter AS anchor.
Note: It is FFS what is other functionalities of the 3GPP anchor in VPLMN
besides user plane anchoring between 2G/3G access systems and LTE system.
It is FFS whether the Mobility anchor between 3GPP and non-3GPP access systems
is provided by entities in the visited network or by the Home Inter AS Anchor.
The IASA in the home network remains the entity that terminates the IP Access
Service.
In case UE traffic is not routed to the HPLMN, the SAE architecture is
depicted in the following figure 4.3-2.
Editor\'s note: The update in clause 4.2 at SA2#52 that the split of the IASA
into two functional entities, namely a 3GPP anchor and SAE anchor, requires
the following figure to be updated. The decision to split the anchors is FFS.
Figure 4.3-2: SAE Roaming architecture -- Local Breakout
Usage of S6 and S9 for providing visited network with static/dynamic policies
is FFS.
In the case it is decided that PCRF in the visited network is used, one
alternative solution is that the enforcement of the Home PLMN policies (e.g.:
QoS and charging policies) by the visited Inter AS Anchor is performed through
the interaction of Home and Visited PCRF. Possibly, the Visited PCRF may
add/modify policies according to those defined in the VPLMN. The related
reference point between PCRFs is referred as S9.
**Additional reference points for roaming scenarios (in addition to those
described in clause 4.2)**
S8: indicates the roaming variant of S5 reference point when the Inter AS
Anchor is located in the HPLMN.
S9: indicates the roaming variant of the S7 reference point for the
enforcement in the VPLMN of dynamic control policies from the HPLMN.
NOTE: S2 and S4 reference points could be interoperator when the GGSN/PDG and
the Inter AS anchor belong to different PLMNs.
## 4.4 Architectural principles
The following architectural principles are agreed. Note that 'roaming' in this
section refers only roaming between SAE networks.
Editor's note: The SAE architecture in section 4.2 and 4.3 need to be updated
according to these principles.
\- S10 interface between MME/UPE and MME/UPE will be standardized for MME/UPE
relocation, which is functionally similar to S3 for inter 2G/3G LTE handover.
\- For the roaming case with the local breakout, the e-PDG shall be in the
visited network.\ For the roaming cases with home routed traffic, the e-PDG
can be in the visited network when the visited network owns the I-WLAN or has
a business relationship with the I-WLAN operator. It can be in the home
network.
\- For the roaming case with home routed traffic, there is a user plane entity
for LI and CDR generation for non-3GPP access in the visited network.
\- S6a between MME/UPE and HSS for authentication and authorization.
\- S6b between SAE PDN gateway and HSS for authorization
\- S6c between SAE MM anchor and HSS (as an AAA server) for mobility related
authentication if needed.
\- For S6a, S6b and S6c, they can be collapsed into one as a result of the
collocated functions.
\- It is desirable to specify the same protocols over S5(a/b) and S8.
\- For non-roaming case, there is no open interface between SAE MM anchor and
SAE PDN gateway. (see the possibly different definitions of SAE MM anchor and
SAE PDN gateway in Annex I)
# 5 Requirements on the Architecture
Editors Note: This clause identifies the major requirements on the
architecture that guide the architecture evolution.
High-level principles
1 3GPP and non 3GPP access systems shall be supported.
2 Shall provide scalable system architecture and solutions without
compromising the system capacity, e.g. by separating the control plane and the
transport plane.
3 Interworking with release 6 3GPP systems (i.e. 3GPP-PS core, 3GPP-IP access
and IMS) shall be supported
4 The C plane response time for the IP-CAN shall be such that (excluding DRX
times) the mobile can move from a fully idle state (this is an idle state
where the mobile is GMM attached, has an IP address allocated and is IMS
registered) to one where it is sending and receiving user plane data in a
significantly reduced time. The target time is less than 200 ms;
5 The Evolved 3GPP System shall support SMS and equivalent functionality to
that provided by the MSC\'s \"SMS message waiting flag\". Note: this might be
provided by the R\'7 WID for \"support of SMS and MMS over generic 3GPP IP
access\".
6 The Evolved 3GPP System shall support basic IP configuration for terminals
that do not have IP connectivity.
7 The functional split will be defined to sufficient level of detail to avoid
overlapping/duplicated functionality, signalling and related delays.
8 The basic IP connectivity in the evolved architecture is established during
the initial access phase of the UE to the network.
9 For the set-up of IP connectivity with enhanced QoS, the number of
signalling transactions shall be minimised.
10 Mobility Management functionality shall be responsible of mobility within
the Evolved 3GPP System and between the Evolved 3GPP System and different
types of access systems.
11 The Evolved 3GPP Mobility Management solution shall be able to accommodate
terminals with different mobility requirements (e.g.: fixed, nomadic and
mobile terminals);
12 The Evolved 3GPP Mobility Management shall allow the network operator to
control the type of access system being used by a subscriber.
13 Mobility procedures within the Evolved 3GPP System, between the Evolved
3GPP System and existing 3GPP Access Systems and between Evolved/Existing 3GPP
access systems and non 3GPP access system shall provide seamless operations of
both real-time (e.g. VoIP) and non real-time applications and services by, for
example, minimizing the packet loss and interruption time.
14 The Evolved 3GPP system should allow route optimization by selecting or re-
selecting the MME, UPE, 3GPP Anchor or SAE anchor so that the user plane
traffic does not need to be tunneled outside the current network area . This
applies in all roaming scenarios (e.g.: when both users are in a visited
network) and some intra-PLMN scenarios (e.g. serving UPE/IASA of the UE has
been changed due to UE's mobility). This is desirable in order to prevent
additional delay and unnecessary waste of backbone bandwidth. The policy rules
of the home network should control whether or not local breakout is used.
15 In order to maximise users\' access opportunities, the evolved architecture
should allow a UE which is roaming to a VPLMN to use a non-3GPP access network
with which the VPLMN has a business agreement. For example, it should be
possible for a user to use a WLAN access network with whom only the visited
operator has a direct relationship (not the home operator).
16 The Evolved 3GPP System shall support Ipv4 and Ipv6 connectivity.
Interworking between Ipv4 and Ipv6 terminals, servers and access systems shall
be possible. Mobility between access systems supporting different IP versions
should be supported with minimum network/terminal impacts.
17 Subscriber security procedures in the Evolved 3GPP System shall assure (at
least) the same security level as current 3GPP CS/PS networks;
18 Access to Evolved 3GPP System shall be possible via existing Rel 99 USIM.
Evolved 3GPP System shall also permit access to inbound roamers from mobile
networks with Rel 5 HSS;
19 The authentication framework should be independent from the specific access
network technology;
20 The evolved 3GPP System shall ensure necessary support for the existing
charging principles (e.g.: calling party pays) both at application and bearer
level.
> 21 Transport overhead needs optimization, especially for the last mile and
> radio interfaces.
22 Signalling overhead on the radio interface should be minimised.
23 Radio interface multicast capability shall be a built-in feature.
24 Evolved system shall support IP multicast service which provides point to
multipoint user data transport.
25 The SAE/LTE system shall at least support handling of regional subscription
/ regional roaming / access restriction (the terms are defined in 22.011). In
case a regional subscription / regional roaming / access restriction applies,
the network may provide the UE with guidance to find another tracking area /
network.
26 The SAE/LTE system shall be able to handle the situation where the home
operator changes a user\'s subscription such that it changes roaming
restrictions.
27 Roaming etc restrictions shall not be more granular than Tracking Area
(consideration for support of RAT specific restrictions needs to be made). SA1
needs to clarify the requirements on RAT specific restrictions.
28 Handling of roaming etc. restrictions for UEs in LTE_IDLE and LTE_ACTIVE
state shall be aligned.
29 LTE/SAE shall support the same level of User Identity Confidentiality as
today\'s 3GPP system (e.g. Idle mode signalling and attach/re-attach with
temporary user identities)
30 The SAE/LTE system shall support network sharing functionality. Details
need to be studied in RAN WGs and SA2.
31 The SAE/LTE system shall support redundancy concepts / load sharing of
network nodes, e.g. similar to today\'s Iu-flex mechanisms. All nodes other
than cell site node should be considered \"distributed resources utilising
load sharing/redundancy mechanisms\".
32 The SAE/LTE system shall provide effective means to limit signalling during
inter-RAT cell-reselection in LTE_IDLE state. For example, similar performance
to that of the \"Selective RA Update procedure\" defined in TS 23.060.
Optimisation for movement to/from states such as URA-PCH and GPRS-Standby
shall be studied.
33 It shall be possible to support service continuity between IMS over SAE/LTE
access and the CS domain. It shall be achieved with minimum impact on the CS
domain.
34 It shall be possible to support IMS and its communication services over
SAE/LTE access, including the support of calls between IMS over SAE/LTE access
and the CS domain.
35 It shall be possible for the operator to provide the UE with access network
information pertaining to locally supported 3GPP and non-3GPP access
technologies. The access network information may also include operator
preferences based on locally available 3GPP and non-3GPP access technologies,
and the information may be restricted to the access technologies or access
networks the UE can use.
36 It shall be possible to perform Lawful Intercept for both roaming and non-
roaming users for all access systems the user are allowed to use.
37 The mobility management shall be able to provide location hiding
capabilities without increasing system complexity. The location hiding
capabilities may be provided differently per operator (e.g. applied for all
users, only for the required users, not required at all). The mobility
management shall also be able to enable location privacy protection when to
users who require this privacy service, and in this case local breakout and
route optimization support might be disabled.
38 The mobility management between 3GPP and non 3GPP access systems should
have minimum impact on the access technologies and it should be independent
from transport technologies.
39 The mobility management shall support the anchoring of traffic for a UE
within a SAE CN node to allow charging and other service enabling functions to
be performed. This does not preclude the possibility to change the SAE CN
nodes to allow route optimization.
40 It shall be possible to be compatible with the existing 3GPP roaming
interfaces when SAE interworks with pre-SAE/LTE network.
41 The mobility management is provided without degrading the current 3G
security level. This means both control signalling and user data are securely
transported. It is desirable that the mobility management entity for LTE
access is not directly addressable by the UE.
Editor\'s note: Initial list to be completed.
# 6 Scenarios and Solutions
Editors Note: This clause identifies potential scenarios based on drivers such
as social and new emerging technologies that have an impact on the existing
reference architecture. The identified scenarios are used to explore the
architecture options and as a base for identifying the key architectural
issues. The scenarios may be based on the outcome from AIPN in SA1 and the
TSG-RAN\'s Study Item on Radio Evolution (see SP‑040915). The scenarios should
identify how migration and/or evolution from current systems occur.
# 7 Key Architectural Issues
Editors Note: This clause identifies key issues e.g. related to mobility and
QoS mechanisms, solutions for key Issues and impact on the Architecture i.e.
7.1 Key Issue 1
7.1.1 Description of Key Issue 1
7.1.2 Solution for key issue 1
7.1.3 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture
7.1.4 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture
7.1.5 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture]
## 7.1 Key Issue Policy control and Charging
### 7.1.1 Description of Key Issue Policy control and Charging
The PCC functionality comprises important functionality related to the
configuration of certain filters and packet processing rules. Typical use of
such rules and filters include flow based charging, gating, QoS control, etc.
Such rules may implement multiple services of various types, including ones
from 3^rd^ party suppliers and hence are an important part since it is related
to a subscription and how services are authorized and charged for e.g. zero
rating, price bundling, premium price etc depending on the particular
configuration of an operator. In a Rel-7 context PCC considers a number of
input parameters such as QoS parameters and for GPRS case TFTs and if a PDP
context was activated by a secondary PDP context activation procedure, etc.
before finally implementing a rule. It is key for an operator to be able to
use a configuration of rules (policy and charging), which apply to Rel-7
architecture and terminals also in long term, i.e., smooth migration is
important. The PCRFs interaction with future CN should be based on the
existing PCC Rel-7 interfaces. It should be noted that some Rel-7 models (e.g.
the QoS model) may be further evolved in the SAE work.
With the introduction of new 3GPP radio access technologies operators need to
be in control of the use of each 3GPP radio access technology. The policy
should take subscriber identity and other circumstances into account. The use
of a different radio access technology may also lead to changes in other
policies, e.g. different rating, etc.
### 7.1.2 Solution for key issue Policy control and Charging
\- It shall be possible to inform the PCRF what radio access technology a
subscriber is utilizing since depending on operator configuration it may
influence what policy control and charging rule is being activated by a PCRF.
\- The PCC interfaces already defined in Rel-7 shall be used as a basis in an
SAE context and may be evolved to meet SAE requirements.
Editors Note: In a B1 context, cf. Annex B, the enforcement point of the
mobility anchor that resides in the core network shall be controlled by a
PCRF. In a B2 context, it is FFS if the Inter AS-MM shall contain an
enforcement point that is controlled by a PCRF. Alternatively in a B2 context,
it is FFS how the interaction between the PCRF(s) and IP Gateways is performed
in Inter Access System Handover.
\- The PCC functionality shall in an effective way be able to handle different
QoS models cf. e.g. I-WLAN vis-à-vis WCDMA.
### 7.1.3 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture
The PCC functionality shall be evolved from the existing Rel-7 PCC interfaces.
It shall be possible to inform the baseline CN architecture what radio access
technology (including an evolved RAN) is being used by a subscriber.
### 7.1.4 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture
In case the baseline RAN architecture support multiple RAN access technologies
it may be needed to inform the PCRF what radio access technology a subscriber
is utilizing including an evolved RAN access technology.
### 7.1.5 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
Editors Note: It is FFS whether there is any particular terminal impact from
the evolution of Policy control and Charging architecture. However at the
moment no particular terminal impact has been identified.
## 7.2 Key Issue- Roaming with Local Breakout
### 7.2.1 Description of Key Issue -- Roaming with Local Breakout
Roaming is when users receive service when they are in a VPLMN, i.e. in a
network other than their HPLMN.
Local breakout might optimize access to visited network services and might
allow for user plane traffic route optimization. Control plane traffic may
also break out locally for emergency services or to obtain better signalling
performance and better user experience. In this clause it is clarified which
interfaces are the roaming interfaces, and how roaming and local breakout
works in general for the evolved architecture.
### 7.2.2 Solution for key issue -- Roaming with Local Breakout
Roaming of subscribers (to different VPLMNs and to different types of VPLMN
access) requires certain policies from the home operator to be available in
the Visited network. This information may be downloaded or it may be pre-
configured and used during the subscriber access to the visited network. These
policies may be static, dynamic or a combination.
In order to provide high performance as well as real time services for roaming
customers, efficient routing of user data or media traffic is required. For
some services, e.g. emergency services, Control plane traffic may also break
out locally. Features shall be provided to the home operator to negotiate with
the visited operator:
\- if the traffic of the user is always transported to the home network over a
roaming interface or broken out locally for transport towards the destination;
\- and, if the default IP address (i.e. the IP address from PDN address space
to access PDN) can be allocated by the visited PLMN or not.
Furthermore, it should be possible to perform local breakout for some traffic
of the user but not the other traffic. How to accomplish this is FFS.
Such policies shall be based on the home operator\'s preference and have a
granularity such that the gain justifies the roaming infrastructure and
complexity in operations for such a set up.
The IP Gateway (defined as GW in the context of current Policy and Charging
Control work) in a VPLMN may connect to multiple HPLMNs. The IP Gateways in
the VPLMN serves to enforce the policies and charging as negotiated between
the visited and home operators. The result of the enforcements and the
information of charging should be provided to the home operator when required.
Using the policy enforcement function in the IP Gateway in the visited
network, home operators can control routing of traffic for roaming users. The
IP Gateway in the HPLMN serves as a global mobility anchor point and at the
same time enforces the policies of, and the charging for the home operator.
This IP Gateway can provide session continuity, even if the VPLMN changes.
In order to support return traffic optimization for the roaming user, the
roaming user should use an IP address belonging to the VPLMN. On the other
hand, in order to attain session continuity when roaming from HPLMN to VPLMN,
the user should keep using the IP address that is assigned by HPLMN. Mobility
management protocol should be aware of this so that it can support local
breakout for roaming users.
The initial focus is put on local breakout of IMS bearer traffic, however
since SAE must apply in general, the impacts on local breakout from other
services shall not be precluded.
### 7.2.2.1 Analysis of Local Breakout of IMS bearer traffic
Local breakout of IMS bearer traffic allows for route optimisation for IMS
bearer traffic so that it does not need to be tunnelled outside the current
network area. This applies in all roaming scenarios and some intra-PLMN
scenarios. This is desirable in order to prevent additional delay and
unnecessary waste of backbone bandwidth. The policy rules of the home network
should control whether or not local breakout is used. Depending on the
solution the IMS control plane traffic (i.e. SIP signalling) may be anchored
in the home network or in the visited network.
##### 7.2.2.1.1 Alternative solution 1 -- Visited P-CSCF
##### 7.2.2.1.1.1 Description {#description .H6}
In this scenario the PDN SAE GW and the P-CSCF are located in the Visited
network, as depicted in Figure X1.
Figure 7.2-1: Local Breakout with Visited P-CSCF
From SAE perspective it looks as if the accessed PDN is in the Visited
network. Mw is the reference point crossing the inter-PLMN boundary. In order
to authorise a bearer, the vPCRF function may have to contact the hPCRF via
S9.
This approach requires only one IP address for both SIP signalling and user
plane traffic.
This configuration does not support inter-PLMN handovers because the latter
imply a relocation of the PDN SAE GW from one VPLMN to another.
This configuration also requires special arrangement for the roaming
subscriber to access non-IMS services hosted in the HPLMN, without exposing
those services to all subscribers in the VPLMN.
##### 7.2.2.1.1.2 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture {#impact-on-the-
baseline-cn-architecture-1 .H6}
Impact on REL-7 PCC architecture is FFS.
##### 7.2.2.1.1.3 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture {#impact-on-the-
baseline-ran-architecture-1 .H6}
No impact currently foreseen.
##### 7.2.2.1.1.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
{#impact-on-terminals-used-in-the-existing-architecture-1 .H6}
FFS.
##### 7.2.2.1.2 Alternative solution 2 -- Dual IP addresses
##### 7.2.2.1.2.1 Description {#description-1 .H6}
In this scenario, there are two PDN SAE GWs:
• PDN SAE GW1 used for anchoring of SIP signalling and located in the Home
network;
• PDN SAE GW2 used for anchoring of bearer traffic and located in the Visited
network.
Figure 7.2-2: Local Breakout with Dual IP addresses
From SAE perspective this looks like concurrent access to Multiple PDNs (refer
to the Key Issue in Section 7.10). Rel-7 IMS supports the usage of different
IP addresses for the SIP signalling and for the bearer traffic. Note that when
PCC function is active, support of multiple IP addresses is not possible/does
not work today. In addition, certain NAT configurations do not work with
multiple IP addresses on IMS.
S9 is used in order to provide PCC rules to the vPCRF function in the Visited
network, which then distributes the PCC information towards PDN SAE GW2 via
S7.
Inter-PLMN handovers are supported by re-assigning a new PDN SAE GW2 in the
target VPLMN (note that PDN SAE GW1 is not re-assigned).
For intra-PLMN handovers involving Serving SAE GW change it may be possible to
defer the re-assignment of a new PDN SAE GW2 until the completion of any
ongoing calls.
##### 7.2.2.1.2.2 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture {#impact-on-the-
baseline-cn-architecture-2 .H6}
Impact on REL-7 PCC architecture is FFS.
Applicability to the GTP-based S8a is FFS.
##### 7.2.2.1.2.3 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture {#impact-on-the-
baseline-ran-architecture-2 .H6}
No impact currently foreseen.
##### 7.2.2.1.2.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
{#impact-on-terminals-used-in-the-existing-architecture-2 .H6}
How the IMS client in the terminal is instructed about the usage of two IP
addresses is FFS.
In case of handover involving PDN SAE GW change (e.g. inter-PLMN handover),
the IMS client may have to manage the change of the IP address in the bearer
plane (e.g. by sending SIP reINVITE to the remote party).
##### 7.2.2.1.3 Alternative solution 3 -- MIPv6 Route Optimisation when host-
based mobility is used
##### 7.2.2.1.3.1 Description {#description-2 .H6}
In this scenario there is only one PDN SAE GW located in the Home network.
Inter-technology mobility is based on Client MIP (e.g. DS MIPv6). The Care-of
Address (CoA) is assigned by the Serving SAE GW, located in the Visited
network.
Figure 7.2-3: Local Breakout with MIPv6 Route Optimisation
Before RO is activated, all traffic (both SIP signalling and bearer traffic)
is backhauled to the Home network. When the RO is activated, the bearer
traffic can break out from the Serving GW and can be routed directly to the
correspondent node.
S9 is used in order to provide PCC rules to the vPCRF function in the Visited
network, which then distributes the PCC information towards Serving SAE GW via
S7.
NOTE: For MIP RO traffic the packet filtering in the Serving SAE GW should be
beyond the IP-5 tuple.
The MIPv6 Return Routability procedure used for preparation of the optimised
route may be an issue for real time media in case of CoA change (e.g. due to
inter-technology handover) with activated RO, because of the need to re-
establish the optimised route on the new CoA. However, there are optimisations
for the MIPv6 Return Routability procedure available to reduce signalling and
handover delay.
##### 7.2.2.1.3.2 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture {#impact-on-the-
baseline-cn-architecture-3 .H6}
This approach is not aligned with the current assumption about the usage of
network-based mobility on S8b (cf. new reference point Gi* in the figure).
Impact on REL-7 PCC architecture is FFS.
##### 7.2.2.1.3.3 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture {#impact-on-the-
baseline-ran-architecture-3 .H6}
No impact currently foreseen.
##### 7.2.2.1.3.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
{#impact-on-terminals-used-in-the-existing-architecture-3 .H6}
## 7.3 Tracking Area
### 7.3.1 Description of issue
In GSM, mobiles are tracked in Location Areas and Routeing Areas. In UMTS,
mobiles can be tracked in UTRAN Registration Areas as well as Las and Ras.
Within this Technical Report, Tracking Area is used as a generic name for LA,
RA and URA.
Within the LTE/SAE work, there has been debate about how many levels of
Tracking Area there should be.
### 7.3.2 Agreements on Tracking Area Issues
It is agreed that:
\- There is only one common Tracking Area concept defined for RAN and CN in
LTE/SAE.
\- The location of a UE in LTE_IDLE is known by the network on a Tracking Area
granularity.
\- A UE in LTE_IDLE is paged in all cells of the Tracking Area in which it is
currently registered.
\- In order to avoid excessive Tracking Area update signalling within LTE, for
terminals located on a Tracking Area border, the following solutions should be
considered (detailed solutions are FFS);
a) Allow one LTE cell to belong to multiple Tracking Areas, and allow the
Tracking Areas to partially overlap each other
b) Support the allocation of multiple Tracking Areas to the same terminal.
## 7.4 Radio Access Network -- Core Network Functional Split
This clause describes the allocation of functions to either the RAN or the CN.

## 7.5 Key Issue Inter 3GPP Access System Mobility in Idle State
### 7.5.1 Description of Key Issue Inter 3GPP Access System Mobility in Idle
State
Idle State Inter 3GPP Access System Mobility functionality maintains the
registration of a user/UE in the serving 3GPP Access System so that mobile
originated and mobile terminated packet transfer may be initiated. In Idle
State the UE reselects between SAE/LTE and other 3GPP access systems.
Furthermore, Idle State Inter 3GPP Access System Mobility updates within the
network any user plane routing and any potential tunnelling information so
that data path is established between intersystem mobility anchor and the UPE
of the 3GPP Access System the UE is registered with.
Idle State Inter 3GPP Access System Mobility maintains subscriber identity
confidentiality, i.e. temporary user identities are used where necessary.
### 7.5.2 Solution for key issue Inter 3GPP Access System Mobility in Idle
State
Editor\'s note: Whether a UE can be registered in more than one 3GPP access
system at one time and the possible effects on SAE/LTE is FFS.
#### 7.5.2.1 Alternative Solution A
##### 7.5.2.1.1 General
The SAE/LTE 3GPP Access System has an MME (FFS whether in RAN or CN). The
corresponding 2G/3G MME is the SGSN. Furthermore, the SAE/LTE 3GPP Access
System has a UPE. The corresponding 2G/3G UPE is the SGSN or SGSN/GGSN. The UE
registers with the MME and UPE of the selected 3GPP Access System. The MME of
the 3GPP Access System stores a UE contexts, e.g. permanent and temporary user
identities, mobility state, tracking area. The UPE of the 3GPP Access System
stores a UE context, e.g. parameters of the basic IP bearer service, keeps
network internal routing information. The MME can store the UE context for
long to allow for detach and reattach with temporary identity (user identity
confidentiality). The UE is only in one 3GPP access systems registered at one
time and not at multiple in parallel.
The SAE/LTE 3GPP Access System combines network attach and establishment of
basic IP bearer capabilities (always on), i.e. all parameters required for a
best effort IP bearer service are allocated for the UE. In idle state all data
transfer resources between UE and network are released and only information
for basic IP bearer is stored in the network. There is a simple, preferably
unique, mapping between 2G/3G and SAE IP bearer parameters
According to 2G/3G and LTE idle state definitions the UE (re-)selects cells
and also access systems. The change of the access system in idle state
triggers a network registration by the UE. It is FFS whether this is triggered
by different tracking areas for different access systems or by other
information.
User identity confidentiality requires the UE to register the access system
change with the network using a temporary identity. The temporary identity is
resolved to a permanent identity by the old serving MME. This information
transfer between old and new serving MME transfers also other UE context
information like security parameters and IP bearer parameters to the new
serving MME/UPE. The UE context transfer is preferred as it is typically
faster than establishing security association and IP bearer again in another
access system.
##### 7.5.2.1.2 Alternative Solution A1
In the information flow below MME and UPE are shown together in the first
case, for simplicity reasons.
NOTE: This does not preclude a separation. Two independent entities require an
interface between both for example for paging, then registration between each
other and double context transfer.
In the second case, MME, UPE and Inter AS Anchor are shown together as another
option.
The routing between UPE and intersystem mobility anchor is updated, which is
the precondition for being able to page the UE when downlink data arrive. For
change from 2G/3G to SAE/LTE case, establishment of basic IP bearer
capabilities (always on) (i.e. all parameters required are allocated to the
UE) is performed during the change procedure if no basic IP bearer exists
before change. The home register (e.g. HSS) is updated with registration of
the UE at another MME/UPE. This scenario is shown in the figure 7.5-1.
This solution is also covering the case when the MME/UPE and the Intersystem
Mobility Anchor is co-located (see step 10 of the signalling flow), see figure
7.5.1.a. In this case the routing between UPE and intersystem mobility anchor
updates do not require standardised mechanism.
Figure 7.5-1: 3GPP Inter Access System Change between SAE/LTE and 2G/3G
Figure 7.5-1.a: 3GPP Inter Access System Change between SAE/LTE and 2G/3G
(MME/UPE/IASA collocated)
Figure 7.5-2: Information flow for change in idle state from 2G/3G to SAE/LTE
1) The UE in idle state re-selects a different 3GPP access system.
2) The access system reselection triggers a network registration by the UE and
sends its temporary identity and potentially its old tracking area or another
parameter identifying the old MME/UPE to the new MME/UPE.
3) The new MME/UPE derives an address of the UE\'s old MME/UPE from the
parameters sent by the UE. The new MME/UPE sends the UE parameters to the old
MME/UPE.
4) The old MME/UPE sends a UE context to the new MME/UPE. The UE context
includes a permanent user identity and other information, e.g. security and IP
bearer parameters.
5) The user/UE may be authenticated in the new MME/UPE.
6) The new MME/UPE derives from the permanent user identity an HSS address and
registers itself as the MME/UPE serving the user at the HSS.
7) The HSS deletes the UE context in the old MME/UPE.
8) The HSS confirms the registration of the new MME/UPE.
9) The new MME/UPE updates the route from the intersystem mobility anchor to
itself. Mobile terminated packets arrive at the new MME/UPE. In case the
MME/UPE and the Intersystem Mobility Anchor is collocated this step is not
required.
10) The new MME/UPE confirms the UE\'s network registration and allocates a
new temporary identity to the UE.
For change in Idle State from SAE/LTE to 2G/3G the same information flow is
applicable with a changed order of MME/UPE entities.
Editor\'s Note: The above solution does not cover inter-system mobility for
Ues in URA-PCH. It is highly desirable to support signalling optimisations for
Ues in URA-PCH state as well. Solutions are FFS.
##### 7.5.2.1.3 Alternative Solution A2
In this solution, the SAE UPE contains the mobility anchor function for
inter-3GPP access systems to handle mobility between 2G/3G and SAE. The
location of the mobility anchor function for 3GPP to non-3GPP access system
does not impact this solution, since this solution is for mobility between
3GPP access systems.
Figure 7.5-3: 3GPP Inter Access System Change between SAE/LTE and 2G/3G for
Solution A2.
When an SAE-capable UE in IDLE mode is attached in 2G/3G and then selects an
LTE cell, the UE initiates a Tracking Area Update. The 2G/3G MME treats this
as an inter-SGSN routing area update as shown in the following figure.
It is assumed that a SAE-capable UE always uses an SAE UPE instead of a 2G/3G
GGSN in order to meet the goal of simplification.
Figure 7.5-4: Information flow for change in idle state from 2G/3G to SAE/LTE
1) The UE in idle state re-selects a different 3GPP access system.
2) The access system reselection triggers a network registration by the UE and
sends its temporary identity and potentially its old tracking area or another
parameter identifying the old MME/UPE to the new SAE MME.
3) The new SAE MME derives an address of the UE\'s old MME from the parameters
sent by the UE. The new SAE MME sends the UE parameters to the old MME.
4) The old MME sends a UE context to the new SAE MME. The UE context includes
a permanent user identity and other information, e.g. security and IP bearer
parameters.
5) The user/UE may be authenticated in the new SAE MME.
6) The new SAE MME derives from the permanent user identity an HSS address and
registers itself as the MME serving the user at the HSS.
7) The HSS deletes the UE context in the old MME/UPE.
8) The HSS confirms the registration of the new SAE MME.
9) The MME provides the UPE with information to configure the user plane. In
case an IP Bearer is not already established for the UE in 2G/3G network, the
new SAE MME initiates an IP address allocation from the UPE. The UE is now
known in the UPE.
> 10) The new SAE MME confirms the UE\'s network registration and sends a new
> temporary identity to the UE. Mobile terminated packets arrive at the UPE.
> If a new IP address has been allocated in step 9, it is provided to the UE.
Editor\'s Note: The above solution does not cover inter-system mobility for
Ues in URA-PCH. It is highly desirable to support signalling optimisations for
Ues in URA-PCH state as well. Solutions are FFS.
##### 7.5.2.1.4 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture
The baseline CN architecture needs to be able to address SAE MME/UPEs and to
perform context transfer with 2G/3G MME/UPEs. In case of Gn procedures, the
user plane between 2G/3G UPE and SAE UPE and the signalling plane between
2G/3G MME and SAE MME can be accomplished based on GTP-U and GTP-C protocols
respectively with enhancements.
##### 7.5.2.1.5 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture
The baseline RAN architecture may support the UE in Idle State re-selection of
the SAE/LTE 3GPP Access System.
##### 7.5.2.1.6 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether there is any particular terminal impact.
#### 7.5.2.2 Alternative Solution B
##### 7.5.2.2.1 Description
Editor\'s note: Whether a UE can be registered in more than one 3GPP access
system at one time and the possible effects on SAE/LTE is FFS.
The proposed solution implements a loose interworking between SAE/LTE and
2G/3G, since the interconnection between the two access systems is realized at
user-IP layer (over Gi interface, for the legacy system) via Mobile IP
protocol. Terminating IP traffic is routed correctly to the UE that has moved
from SAE/LTE to 2G/3G (and vice-versa) via Mobile IP.
It is FFS whether MIP v4,MIPv6 or Proxy MIP is used.
The SAE/LTE network is seen as an external IP network for 2G/3G, and vice-
versa: for this reason the inter 3GPP access system mobility mechanisms apply
also to mobility between 3GPP and non 3GPP access systems.
Intra-system mobility is handled in each access system according to its own
network-based mechanisms (e.g. GTP for 2G/3G). Each Access System is regarded
as an _edge domain,_ i.e. a PLMN domain within which the UE acquires and keeps
the same IP address (IP~edge~) and where the UE\'s movements are handled using
a local mobility management protocol (e.g. NETLMM [12]). It is FFS how
different 3GPP access systems can be managed within a single edge domain.
Since the UE keeps the same IP~edge~ address, the network-based mobility
protocol properly updates routing information towards a local user plane
anchor point (Local Mobility End Point, L-MEP) so that all packets destined to
IP~edge~ address are correctly routed towards the moving UE.
Any mobility event across the _edge domains_ (i.e. 2G/3G GPRS network and
SAE/LTE network) is handled by anchoring the UE traffic to a fixed anchor
(inter-domain anchor, or Global Mobility End Point, G-MEP). The G-MEP can be
located in the home or in the visited network depending on IP bearer service
requirements (i.e. whether the global IP address needs to be assigned by the
visited or by the home network). In order to perform this, two different IP
addresses will be associated to the UE: the IP~Edge~ address, belonging to the
L-MEP subnet, and an IP address belonging to the subnet of the G-MEP
(IP~Global~). The IP~Globa~ address is the address known at application level,
used by the UE to communicate with corresponding nodes, valid for all the
session duration: since it doesn\'t change at access system change (only
IP~Edge~ does), it guarantees session continuity. A global mobility protocol
takes care of updating the route from the G-MEP to the correct L-MEP,
associating each new acquired IP~Edge~ address to the IP~Global~ address. When
MIP is used as global mobility protocol, G-MEP is the Home Agent, IP~Edge~ is
the Care-of-Address (CoA) and IP~Global~ is the Home Address.
For the SAE/LTE 3GPP Access System, L-MEP corresponds to the \"user plane
anchor\" for Intra LTE mobility case, as depicted in fig. 7.7-1, sec. 7.7.2.
The L-MEP is located in the SAE packet core of the PLMN the UE is currently
attached to. An example of suitable network-based mobility protocol can be
found in NETLMM [12]. The L-MEP could be co-located with UPE, except when
privacy requirements apply.
For the 2G/3G Access system, the L-MEP corresponds to the GGSN and the
network-based mobility protocol is GTP. The corresponding 2G/3G UPE is the
GGSN.
The SAE/LTE 3GPP Access System has an MME (FFS whether in RAN or CN). The
corresponding 2G/3G MME is the SGSN.
The UE registers with the MME/UPE and the user plane anchor point of the
selected 3GPP Access System, obtaining an IP~Edge~. The MME/UPE of the 3GPP
Access System stores a UE contexts, e.g. permanent user identities, mobility
state, tracking area. The UE (based on configuration options or on a specific
request from the network) sends a MIP Registration Request to the inter-domain
anchor (Home Agent) to bind its current IP~Edge~ address (CoA) to the
IP~Global~ address (HA). The IP~Global~ can be a static or a dynamic IP
address.
The 2G/3G UPE of the 3GPP Access System stores a UE contexts, e.g. parameters
of the basic IP bearer service, keeps network internal routing information.
The UE is only in one 3GPP access systems registered at one time and not at
multiple in parallel.
According to 2G/3G and LTE idle state definitions the UE (re-)selects cells
and also access systems. The change of the Access System in idle state
triggers a network attach by the UE. It is FFS whether this is triggered by
different tracking areas for different access systems or by other information.
The SAE/LTE 3GPP Access System combines network attach and establishment of
basic IP bearer capabilities (always on), i.e. all parameters required for a
best effort IP bearer service are allocated for the UE. In idle state all data
transfer resources between UE and network are released and only information
for basic IP bearer is stored in the network. There is a simple, preferably
unique, mapping between 2G/3G and SAE IP bearer parameters
A global mobility protocol takes care of updating the inter-domain user plane
anchor with the IP address acquired by the UE in the new Access System. The
routing between the new local user plane anchor and intersystem mobility
anchor is updated, which is the precondition for being able to page the UE
when downlink data arrive. And, the home register (e.g. HSS) is updated with
registration of the UE at another MME/UPE. These functions are shown in the
figure 7.5-5.
Inter 3GPP Access Mobility in LTE idle is performed with a re-attach based
scheme (no context transfer).
Figure 7.5-5: 3GPP Inter Access System Change between SAE/LTE and 2G/3G
The message sequence in figure 7.5-6 illustrates the high-level procedures for
this solution alternative. In the information flows below, MME and UPE/user
plane anchor are shown together for simplicity reasons. This does not preclude
a separation.

Figure 7.5-6: Information flow for change in idle state from 2G/3G to SAE/LTE
1) The UE in idle state re-selects a different 3GPP Access System.
2) The Access System reselection triggers a network attach by the UE.
3) The UE is authenticated in the new MME/UPE. As a result of a successful
authentication, the UE gets an IP address belonging to the subnet of the user
plane anchor (IP~Edge~). For routing optimization purposes the user plane
anchor can be co-located with the UPE.
4) The new MME/UPE registers itself as serving the UE in the HSS.
5) The UE contexts in the old MME/UPE (SGSN and GGSN) may be deleted by an
explicit network request, or after a timer expires.
6) The HSS confirms the registration of the new MME/UPE.
7) The new MME/UPE confirms the UE\'s network registration.
8) The intersystem mobility anchor is updated with the IP~Edge~ address. This
step can be based on MIPv4, RFC 3344 [10] or MIPv6, RFC 3775 [11]. In case
MIPv6 is used, the UE sends a MIP Registration request to the Intersystem
mobility anchor (Home Agent), with IP~Edge~ as a CoA. Terminating packets from
the intersystem mobility anchor will be tunneled towards the user plane
anchor. The tunnel can terminate on the terminal (MIPv6 or MIPv4 with FA co-
located mode) or on the user plane anchor (MIPv4 with FA located mode).
A similar flow applies for the change in idle state from SAE/LTE to 2G/3G.
In order to avoid Mobile IP impacts on the 2G/3G part of dual mode Ues and
reduce air interface signalling, Proxy MIP could be used for idle mobility
management between EUTRAN and UTRAN/GSM.
When Proxy MIP is used into the architecture, the proxy MIP node should be
included in SGSN/GGSN and User plane anchor. In this case user plane route
update could be initiated by Proxy MIP node. Inter 3GPP access Mobility
management in LTE idle is performed as Figure 7.5-7.
Figure 7.5-7: Information flow for change in idle state from 2G/3G to SAE/LTE
1) The UE in idle state re-selects a different 3GPP Access System.
2) The access System reselection triggers a network registration by UE with
temporary identity and potentially its old tracking area or another parameter
identifying the old MME/UPE to the new SAE MME.
3) The new SAE MME derives an address of the UE\'s 2G/3G MME/UPE from the
parameters sent by the UE. The new SAE MME/UPE sends the UE parameters to the
old MME/UPE.
4) The old MME/UPE sends a UE context to the new SAE MME. The UE context
includes a permanent user identity and other information, e.g. security and IP
bearer parameters. The UE context may also include MIP context, such as a HoA
for the UE, UE-HA MSA.
5) If the new SAE MME/UPE couldn't get UE context from 2G/3G SGSN/GGSN, the
new SAE MME/UPE authenticates UE. If the new SAE MME/UPE has no valid MSA
between UE and IASA, HSS should send MSAs needed for mobile IP to SAE MME/UPE
in this step.
6) The new MME/UPE registers itself as serving the UE in the HSS.
7) The UE contexts in the old MME/UPE (SGSN and GGSN) may be deleted by an
explicit network request, or after a timer expires.
8) The HSS confirms the registration of the new MME/UPE.
9) If IASA has valid MSA between UE and IASA, mobile IP registration is done
directly between new MME/UPE and IASA, without the involvement of HSS; If IASA
has no valid MSA between UE and IASA, IASA may need to communicate with HSS
for authentication and for retrieval of MSAs. The user plane between new
MME/UPE and IASA is established during the mobile IP registration procedure.
10) The new MME/UPE confirms the UE\'s network registration.

non-3GPP systems. These are listed separately in this document.

## 7.6 Key issue: Limiting signalling due to idle mode mobility between E-UTRA
and UTRA/GSM
### 7.6.1 Requirement
Clause 5 of this TR contains the following requirement:
_\"The SAE/LTE system shall provide effective means to limit mobility related
signalling during inter-RAT cell-reselection in LTE_IDLE state. For example,
with similar performance to that of the \"Selective RA Update procedure\"
defined in TS 23.060.\"_
In this issue, the limiting signalling over the air interfaces is an important
issue. The limiting signalling for updating the tracking area (routing area,
in case of UTRA/2G) and signalling for paging must be considered together,
since the two have a trade-off relationship.
### 7.6.2 Potential Solutions
The following solutions/concepts have been identified so far:
a) Separate Routeing Area/Do nothing
b) Common Routeing Area/Common SGSN
c) Common RNC
d) Equivalent Ras and SGSN proxy
e) UE remains camped on the last used RAT
f) Packet Data Bearer Proxy
g) Inter RAT Resource Allocation
h) User-IP layer interconnection
i) combined MME/SGSN
Other potential solutions might be identified in the future. Further
information on the above solutions is included in Annex D \"More detailed
descriptions of potential solutions for limiting signalling due to idle mode
mobility between E-UTRA and UTRA/GSM \".
### 7.6.3 Selected Solution(s)
As they are currently described, potential solutions a, b and e do not provide
sufficient limitation of mobility related signalling during inter-RAT cell re-
selection in idle state. Potential solutions a, b and e are hence ruled out.
Following TSG-RAN decisions on the nature of the LTE-RAN architecture,
potential solution c is ruled out.
Owing to not considering the characteristic of UE's movement at the beginning
and the push mode for context retrieval, potential solution d is ruled out.
Potential solution f is ruled out since MME should have interface with HSS.
Owing to the working assumption on UTRA-LTE handover, potential solution h is
ruled out.
Potential solution i, \"combined MME/SGSN\" does not meet all operational
requirements. However the adopted solution should not prevent the
implementation of a combined MME/SGSN.
It is agreed that the selected solution should be developed using a
standardised signalling interface between MME and SGSN. Potential solutions d,
f and g all contain information that should be considered when developing one
unified solution.
It is agreed that the selected solution should _use potential mechanisms
described in Annex D.4.4 or D.4.6 or D.4.7 for context retrieval. It is FFS
which one of the mechanisms is selected._
It is agreed that UE registers to both the SAE network and the UMTS network
separately. After that, whether the MME and the SGSN should be both registered
to HSS is FFS. It is also agreed that the UE gets separate RAI and TAI for
2G/3G or LTE/SAE mobility management, allocated respectively by SGSN or
MME/UPE.
## 7.7 Key Issue Intra LTE-Access-System Mobility in LTE_IDLE State
### 7.7.1 Description of Key Issue Intra LTE-Access-System Mobility in
LTE_IDLE State
Intra LTE-Access-System Mobility functionality for Ues in LTE_IDLE State
maintains the registration of a user/UE and keeps track of the location of the
user/UE on Tracking Area base so that mobile originated and mobile terminated
packet transfer may be initiated. Furthermore, Intra LTE-Access-System
Mobility functionality for Ues in LTE_IDLE State updates within the network
any user plane routing and any potential tunnelling information so that data
path is established between intersystem mobility anchor and the UPE.
Intra LTE-Access-System Mobility functionality in LTE_IDLE State maintains
subscriber identity confidentiality, i.e. temporary user identities are used
where necessary.
In intra LTE-Access-System Mobility in LTE_IDLE State, UPE relocation is
needed for certain scenarios.
In case of UPE relocation, it should be possible for IP applications to
provide uninterrupted service to the end user. Depending on the scenario, this
may require support for IP service continuity.
### 7.7.2 Solution for key issue Intra LTE-Access-System Mobility in Idle
State
#### 7.7.2.1 General
The SAE/LTE Access System has an MME (Mobility Management Entity, it is FFS
whether it resides in RAN or CN). Furthermore, the SAE/LTE Access System has a
UPE (User Plane Entity). The UE registers with the MME and the UPE.
The MME stores a UE context data like permanent and temporary user identities,
mobility state, tracking area etc. The MME can store the UE context for long
to allow for detach and reattach with temporary identity (user identity
confidentiality). The SAE/LTE system consists of distributed MMEs utilising
load sharing/redundancy mechanisms (e.g. similar to Iu-flex) enabling mobility
of the UE within a certain geographical area without changing the MME. The
SAE/LTE system supports inter-MME mobility.
The UPE stores UE context data like parameters of the default IP connectivity
service and keeps network internal routing information.
The SAE/LTE Access System combines network attach and establishment of default
IP connectivity capabilities (always on), i.e. all parameters required for an
IP connectivity service with default QoS are allocated for the UE already at
attach. In idle state all data transfer resources between UE and network are
released and only information for default IP connectivity is stored in the
network.
NOTE 1: Issues w.r.t. IP address re-assignment for inter-MME/UPE mobility need
to be clarified.
User identity confidentiality requires the UE to register with the network
using a temporary identity. The temporary identity is resolved to a permanent
identity by the old serving MME.
The routing between UPE and the user-plane anchor is updated, unless the two
are co-located. It is the precondition for being able to page the UE when
downlink data arrive. And, the home register (e.g. HSS) is updated with
registration of the UE at another MME/UPE. These functions are shown in the
figure 7.7-1.
NOTE 2: It is FFS whether inter MME mobility is done with a context transfer
(relocation) or a re-attach based scheme.
NOTE 3: The location of the user plane anchor for intra LTE-Access-System
mobility is FFS.

#### 7.7.2.2 Mobility in LTE_IDLE State
The information flow below depicts the mobility in LTE_IDLE State with
Tracking Area Registration (when under same MME).
Figure 7.7-2: Area Registration
1) UE sends Tracking Area Registration when the previous Tracking Area is no
longer valid or periodical Tracking Area Update timer has expired. The
Tracking Area Registration message contains UE\'s old temporary identity, and
old Tracking area Identity.
Editor\'s note: The exact list of information elements needed in this message
is FFS.
2) MME responds with Confirm Registration. Confirm Registration contains new
Tracking Area Identity, and may also contain a new temporary identity for UE.
#### 7.7.2.3 Intra LTE-Access-System change in idle state with user context
transfer
The information flow below depicts inter-MME/UPE mobility with context
transfer between MME/UPE entities. MME and UPE entities on the old and the new
side are shown together for simplicity reasons assuming a 1:1 relation between
MME and UPE entities. This does not preclude a separation, which would however
require the definition of an interface between both entities.
Figure 7.7-3: Information flow for Intra LTE-Access-System change in idle
state with user context transfer
1) The UE in idle state re-selects an LTE cell.
2) The cell re-selection triggers an area registration if the UE crossed an
Tracking Area boundary. The UE sends its temporary identity and its old
tracking area identifying the old MME/UPE to the new MME/UPE.
3) The new MME/UPE derives an address of the UE\'s old MME/UPE from the
parameters sent by the UE. The new MME/UPE sends the UE parameters to the old
MME/UPE.
4) The old MME/UPE sends the UE context to the new MME/UPE. The UE context
includes a permanent user identity and other information like security and IP
connectivity parameters.
5) The UE may be authenticated in the new MME/UPE.
6) The new MME/UPE derives from the permanent user identity an HSS address and
registers itself as the MME/UPE serving the user at the HSS.
7) The HSS deletes the UE context in the old MME/UPE.
8) The HSS confirms the registration of the new MME/UPE.
9) The new MME/UPE confirms the UE\'s network registration and allocates a new
temporary identity to the UE.
10) The new MME/UPE updates the route from the user plane mobility anchor to
itself. Mobile terminated packets arrive at the new MME/UPE.
#### 7.7.2.4 Intra LTE-Access-System change in idle state with re-attach
A MME/UPE may trigger a change of MME/UPE while the UE is in LTE-IDLE state
using the Network initiated Re-Attachment procedure described in clause
7.13.2.
While performing the Re-attachment procedure, the UE shall establish the same
bearers as used before reattach and also enough information may be provided to
the network to make sure the same Inter-AS Anchor could be selected as the one
which was used before re-attach, if it is necessary for the service
continuity.

### 7.7.6 Alternative solution
#### 7.7.6.1 Solution for key issue Intra LTE-Access-System Mobility in Idle
State
The SAE/LTE Access System has an MME (Mobility Management Entity, it is FFS
whether it resides in RAN or CN). Furthermore, the SAE/LTE Access System has a
UPE (User Plane Entity). The UE registers with the MME and the UPE.
The MME stores a UE context data like permanent and temporary user identities,
mobility state, tracking area etc. The MME can store the UE context for long
to allow for detach and reattach with temporary identity (user identity
confidentiality). The SAE/LTE system consists of distributed MMEs utilising
load sharing/redundancy mechanisms (e.g. similar to Iu-flex) enabling mobility
of the UE within a certain geographical area without changing the MME. The
SAE/LTE system supports inter-MME mobility.
The UPE stores UE context data like parameters of the default IP connectivity
service and keeps network internal routing information.
The SAE/LTE Access System combines network attach and establishment of default
IP connectivity capabilities (always on), i.e. all parameters required for an
IP connectivity service with default QoS are allocated for the UE already at
attach. In idle state all data transfer resources between UE and network are
released and only information for default IP connectivity is stored in the
network.
User identity confidentiality requires the UE to register with the network
using a temporary identity. The temporary identity is resolved to a permanent
identity by the old serving MME.
A MME/UPE is the first IP hop router for the UE.
At power on, the UE attaches to a MME/UPE and gets an IP address belonging to
the subnet of the user plane anchor node. The user plane anchor node could be
collocated with the serving MME/UPE. Otherwise, e.g, for location privacy
reasons, the user plane anchor node could be located in the PLMN core.
In order to avoid frequent IP address re-assignments, the UE shall keep the
same IP address as long as possible. An _edge_ _domain_ is defined as the area
of a PLMN within which the UE can roam without any need to change the (local)
IP address. An _edge domain_ could possibly be as large as the whole PLMN.
As long as the UE changes IP subnet or MME/UPE within the same _edge domain_ ,
the routing between UPE and the user-plane anchor is updated, unless the two
are co-located. It is the precondition for being able to page the UE when
downlink data arrive. And, the home register (e.g. HSS) is updated with
registration of the UE at another MME/UPE. These functions are shown in the
figure 7.7-4.
If UE moves to an MME/UPE belonging to a new _edge domain_ , the UE gets a new
(local) IP address.
In order to allow IP reachability for a UE moving between different _edge
domains_ (e.g. in case the PLMN evolved core is partitioned in more _edge
domains, or in case of movements across different PLMNs_), the (local) IP
address needs to be registered towards a fixed anchor (inter-domain mobility
anchor). This anchor can be located in the home or in the visited network
depending on IP bearer service requirements (i.e. whether the global IP
address needs to be assigned by the visited or by the home network).
The role of the inter-domain function is shown in the figure 7.7‑5.
NOTE: a home based inter-domain mobility anchor may be included in the data
path in general for all roaming Ues that need to obtain an IP address
belonging to the HPLMN.

## 7.8 Key Issue: Inter access system handover
### 7.8.1 Principles and terminologies
There are two different cases for inter access system handover in SAE.
\- Handover between 3GPP access systems: Handover between UTRAN/GERAN and the
SAE/LTE 3GPP Access System.
\- Handover between 3GPP and non 3GPP access systems: Handover between
UTRAN/GERAN/SAE/LTE 3GPP Access System and non 3GPP radio technology including
WLAN 3GPP IP access.
NOTE 1: It is FFS whether the same mechanism can be applied to both cases or
not.
NOTE 2: Solutions for mobility between access systems supporting different IP
versions should be studied as part of this key issue.
NOTE 3: The arguments and conclusions on mobility between access systems
supporting different IP versions presented under this key issue may be
considered in the context of other mobility related key issues.
### 7.8.2 Inter access system handover between 3GPP access systems
(UTRAN/Evolved HSPA/GERAN and SAE/LTE 3GPP access system)
#### 7.8.2.1 Description
Handover between 3GPP access systems maintains the UE\'s established IP packet
bearer service(s) during mobility between 2G/3G access and SAE/LTE 3GPP access
system.
For mobility between 3GPP accesses (UTRAN/Evolved HSPA/GERAN and SAE/LTE), the
mobility and anchoring is performed below the User IP layer or in another
term, below UMTS Gi level. This implies the usage of a common 2G/3G/LTE
mobility anchor and mechanisms that control and perform mobility between the
user plane tunnels (Gn-UP) of existing 2G/3G accesses (GERAN and UTRAN) and
the user plane tunnels of the Evolved Packet Core.
In addition, it is clarified that S3 is GTP based.
Editor's note:\ -The working assumption above does not imply any
protocol/solution on S1 and S5 reference points (see clause 4.2).\ -The
working assumption above does not imply any grouping of functions on other Key
Issues.
It should be noted that this clause does not attempt to draw conclusions to
the investigation of supporting different anchoring mechanisms and mobility
protocols between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses.
#### 7.8.2.2 Alternative solution A
##### 7.8.2.2.1 Description
This alternative solution assumes a grouping of functions as shown in the
figure below, i.e. the functions are grouped:
\- MME and UPE are combined into one functional entity, and
\- Inter AS anchor is one functional entity.
The description is also applicable to a functional grouping that combines SAE
MME, SAE UPE and Inter AS Anchor into one functional entity.
The SAE/LTE 3GPP Access System has an SAE MME (FFS whether in RAN or CN). The
corresponding 2G/3G MME is the SGSN. Furthermore, the SAE/LTE 3GPP access
system has an SAE UPE. The corresponding 2G/3G UPE is the SGSN.
The decision for initiating a handover is made by radio system entities of the
source 3GPP access system.
Handover between 3GPP access systems is performed as a backward handover, i.e.
the radio resources are prepared in the target 3GPP access system before the
UE is commanded by the source 3GPP access system to change to the target 3GPP
access system.
The handover preparation is carried out over the reference point S3.
This reference point is also used to forward user data during handover to
avoid data loss due to handover.
During the handover phase or after the handover phase the user plane routing
and any potential tunnelling between serving 3GPP access system and inter
system mobility anchor is updated to the target 3GPP access system. The UE
registers with the target 3GPP MME and the target 3GPP MME registers with the
HSS.
Figure 7.8-1: Handover between 3GPP access systems for alternative solution A
In the information flow below SAE MME and SAE UPE are shown together for
simplicity reasons. This does not preclude a separation for SAE/LTE. The
separation into two entities requires an interface between both for example
for paging, then registration between each other and doubles context transfer.
Figure 7.8-2: Information flow for handover from 2G/3G to SAE/LTE
1) The IP bearer service is established between UE and Inter AS Anchor via
2G/3G access system and 2G/3G MME/UPE
2) The serving 2G/3G access system decides to initiate a handover to Evolved
RAN.
3) The serving 2G/3G access system indicates Handover Required and the
handover target to its 2G/3G MME/UPE.
3a) The 2G/3G MME/UPE selects a SAE MME/UPE serving the Evolved RAN nodes the
UE is going to use
4) The 2G/3G MME/UPE sends a Handover Preparation Request to the target
Evolved RAN via the selected SAE MME/UPE.
5) The target Evolved RAN establishes bearer resources, including radio
resources, for the UE.
6) The Evolved RAN confirms the Handover Preparation to the 2G/3G MME/UPE via
the selected SAE MME/UPE.
7) The 2G/3G MME/UPE commands the UE to change to the target Evolved RAN.
8) In case the source access system is 3G the 3G access system (RNC) may start
to forward data to its 3G MME/UPE. The 2G/3G MME/UPE forwards data to the
Evolved RAN via the SAE MME/UPE. Depending on the required QoS the 3G access
system (RNC) sends duplicates of the forwarded data also via 3G radio to
minimise data loss.
8a) In case the source access system is 3G the 3G access system (RNC) sends a
Forward SRNS Context message to its 3G MME/UPE. It contains information for
data transfer continuation by a new RNC for lossless relocation. The usage of
this information and mechanisms for inter 3GPP handover is FFS as it implies a
stop of the data transfer at source side, which is needed for a stable data
transfer state.
9) The Radio Bearer is established between UE and target Evolved RAN.
10) The Evolved RAN informs the 2G/3G MME/UPE about handover completion.
11) The 2G/3G MME/UPE acknowledges the handover completion towards the SAE
MME/UPE.
12) The SAE MME/UPE updates the route from the Inter AS Anchor to itself.
Mobile terminated packets arrive at the new MME/UPE.
13) The resource in the source system is released.
14) The IP bearer service is established between UE and Inter AS Anchor via
Evolved RAN and SAE MME/UPE.
15) The UE may need to perform a registration with the new serving SAE
MME/UPE. This triggers the SAE MME to register with the HSS.
For handover from SAE/LTE to 2G/3G the same information flow is applicable
with a changed order of MME/UPE and RAN/access system entities. For this
handover the Evolved NodeB or the SAE MME/UPE may need to duplicate and
forward data as the Evolved RAN has no user plane entity comparable to the
RNC. It is FFS whether and which entity performs duplication in this case.
##### 7.8.2.2.2 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture
The baseline CN architecture needs to be able to address SAE MME/UPEs and to
perform handover procedures with SAE MME/UPEs. In case Gn procedures and RNC
IDs are used to address the Evolved RAN the 3G MME/UPE (SGSN) is not impacted.
Access restrictions, i.e. user specific restrictions for handover to Evolved
RAN, may need an update for the SGSN to know the relevant coding of such
restrictions.
##### 7.8.2.2.3 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture
The baseline RAN architecture handles UE measurements from Evolved RAN and
addresses Evolved RAN handover targets.
##### 7.8.2.2.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
Editors Note: It is FFS whether there is any particular terminal impact.
#### 7.8.2.3 Alternative solution B
##### 7.8.2.3.1 Description
The SAE UPE contains the mobility anchor function for inter-3GPP access
systems to handle mobility between 2G/3G and SAE. The location of the mobility
anchor function for 3GPP to non-3GPP access system does not impact this
solution, since this solution is for mobility between 3GPP access systems
Figure 7.8-3: 3GPP Inter Access System Change between LTE RAN and pre-SAE/LTE
2G/3G RAN for Alternative B
Handover between 3G systems is performed as a backward handover i.e. the radio
resources are prepared in the target 3GPP access system before the UE is
ordered by the source 3GPP access system to change to the target 3GPP access
system.
For the case of a 2G to LTE system mobility when the 2G system has no support
for PS Handover, the UE will first perform cell re-selection before initiating
a Tracking Update Procedure. This results in a \"forward handover\" instead of
the \"backward handover\" and is identical to inter-RAT Mobility in IDLE mode.
The decision for initiating a handover is made by radio system entities of the
source 3GPP access system.
During the handover phase the user plane is established between the LTE Access
and the SAE UPE.
The SAE MME may be collocated with the SAE UPE or with the 2G/3G MME/UPE
(SGSN) in order to simplify the number of interfaces and signalling
transactions.
Figure 7.8-4: Backward Handover from 2G/3G to SAE/LTE
1) The IP bearer service is established between the UE and the SAE UPE via
2G/3G access system and 2G/3G MME/UPE (SGSN)
2) The pre-SAE/LTE 2G/3G Access decides to initiates a handover to LTE Access
3) The pre-SAE/LTE 2G/3G Access sends a Handover Required with the pre-SAE/LTE
2G/3G MME.
3a) The 2G/3G MME/UPE selects a SAE MME serving the Evolved RAN nodes the UE
is going to use
4) The 2G/3G MME derives an address of the target SAE MME and sends a Handover
Preparation Request, including the UE context information. The SAE MME creates
a UE context and sends a Handover Preparation Request (PDP Session) to the LTE
Access.
5) The LTE Access sets up user plane contexts for the SAE UE
6) The LTE Access sends a Handover Preparation Confirm to the SAE MME. The SAE
MME sends a Handover Preparation Confirm to the 2G/3G MME.
7) The 2G/3G MME sends a Handover Command to the UE via the 2G/3G Access.
8) Data loss may be minimised, e.g by bi-casting or data forwarding. Further
details on the data forwarding path are FFS as they depend on the location of
header compression and ciphering.
9) The UE is detected at the LTE Access.
10) LTE Access sends a Handover Complete to the SAE MME. The SAE MME initiates
the Handover Complete Procedure with the 2G/3G MME.
11) The 2G/3G MME acknowledges the handover completion towards the SAE MME.
12) The SAE UPE switches the user plane towards the new LTE Access. The SAE
UPE will now forward all downlink packets to the LTE Access.
13) The resource in the source system is released.
14) The IP Bearer service is now established between the UE and the SAE UPE
via LTE Access and SAE UPE.
15) The UE updates its location using a Tracking Area Update Procedure with
the SAE MME. The SAE MME will initiate the Register MME procedure with the
HSS.
##### 7.8.2.3.2 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture
The baseline CN architecture needs to be able to address SAE MME/UPEs and to
perform handover procedures with 2G/3G MME/UPEs. In case Gn procedures and RNC
IDs are used to address the Evolved RAN the 2G/3G MME/UPE (SGSN) is not
impacted. In case of Gn procedures, the user plane between 2G/3G UPE and SAE
UPE and the signalling plane between 2G/3G MME and SAE MME can be accomplished
based on GTP-U and GTP-C protocols respectively with enhancements.
Access restrictions, i.e. user specific restrictions for handover to Evolved
RAN, may need an update for the SGSN to know the relevant coding of such
restrictions.
##### 7.8.2.3.3 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture
The baseline RAN architecture handles UE measurements from Evolved RAN and
addresses Evolved RAN handover targets.
##### 7.8.2.3.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
Editors Note: It is FFS whether there is any particular terminal impact.
#### 7.8.2.4 Alternative solution C
##### 7.8.2.4.1 Description
This solution is similar to Alternative solution A, but positions the solution
for inter-access system handover between 3GPP access systems at user-IP layer,
rather than below (i.e. tunnel switching below the user-IP layer). That is,
the same basic solution for mobility across 3GPP and non-3GPP access systems
applies, with the addition of handover enhancements as described below. These
enhancements are meant to reduce the handover interruption times across
UTRAN/GERAN and SAE/LTE 3GPP access systems.
Similar to solution alternative A, the decision for initiating a handover is
made by radio system entities of the source 3GPP access system.
Also, the handover between 3GPP access systems is performed as a backward
handover, i.e. the radio resources are prepared in the target 3GPP access
system before the UE is commanded by the source 3GPP access system to change
to the target 3GPP access system.
The handover preparation is carried out over a reference point between target
and source 3GPP access system, i.e. between 2G/3G and SAE/LTE 3GPP access
systems
It is FFS whether this reference point is also used to forward user data
during handover or whether other mechanisms are used to avoid data loss due to
handover, e.g. bi-casting by the intersystem mobility anchor.
During the handover phase or after the handover phase the user plane routing
and any potential tunnelling between serving 3GPP access system and inter
system mobility anchor is updated to the target 3GPP access system. The UE
registers with the target 3GPP access system and the target 3GPP access system
(MME) registers with the HSS.
The message sequence chart in Figure 7.8-5 illustrates the high level
procedures for this solution alternative. In the information flows below, MME
and UPE are shown together for simplicity reasons. This does not preclude a
separation.
Figure 7.8-5: High level procedures for inter-access system handover between
UTRAN/GERAN and SAE/LTE access systems when the inter-system mobility anchor
is not a GTP tunnelling endpoint
Steps 1--8 correspond to the handover preparation phase, similar to that
carried out for 2G/3G PS ISHO enhancements defined in TS 43.129 [7]. If the
direction of the handover is towards 2G/3G, step 3 also triggers GTP tunnel
setup. \"Create PDP Context\" messages are used for this purpose. Given that
the UE IP address needs to be updated during the inter-system handover
procedure, the UE IP address assigned by the target MME/UPE can be passed to
the UE in step 8. This measure allows faster inter-system transitions.
Step 9 can be used to set up temporary IP forwarding tunnel(s) between source
UPE and target UPE. This allows faster inter-system transitions and avoids
packet loss.
Step 11 indicates the completion of the handover preparation phase. The source
radio network can subsequently send a Handover Command.
After the UE sets up the necessary radio resources with the target radio
network in step 13, the UE can start sending and receiving IP packets through
the forwarding tunnel set up in step 10. If step 9 has not been carried out,
then the UE needs to wait till the procedures in step 15 are completed before
sending and receiving IP packets.
Once the user plane route reconfiguration is completed in step 15, the UE can
send and receive IP packets directly through the target system. The forwarding
tunnel that may have been set up in step 10 is no longer used and can be thorn
down at this stage, either through soft state timeout, or through other
explicit signalling (FFS).
Steps 16-20 are maintenance procedures (i.e. release any resources in the
source system and location update). If the source access system is 2G/3G, this
phase also includes tear-down of the GTP tunnel(s) between GGSN and source
SGSN. \"Delete PDP Context\" messages are used for this purpose.
The procedures in Figure 7.8-5 can be based on a combination of procedures
already defined in 3GPP and IETF. More specifically:
Steps 8-10 and 14 can be based on procedures defined in RFC 4068 [8] (for
Ipv6) and draft-ietf-mip4-fmipv4 [9] (for Ipv4).
Step 15 can be based on RFC 3344 [10] (for Ipv4) and RFC 3775 [11] (for Ipv6).
The rest of the steps are similar to the procedures used in TS 43.129 [7].
Figure 7.8-6 shows an example of the mapping of Mobile IP functions and
signalling flows in more detail, when Mobile Ipv4 is operated in FA-located
care-of address mode. It is FFS whether co-located care-of address with IP
header compression would be a more feasible solution compared to FA-located
care-of address mode. A sequence chart for Mobile Ipv6 would look similar, but
in step 15 signalling would be directly between UE and HA, and there are no FA
functions in MME/UPE.
Figure 7.8-6: Example procedures with Mobile IP in FA-located care-of address
mode
##### 7.8.2.4.2 Impact on baseline CN Architecture
The impacts on the baseline CN architecture are as follows:
\- same impacts introduced by a Mobile IP solution for mobility across 3GPP
and non-3GPP systems. These are listed separately in this document.
\- if packet loss mitigation is handled through packet forwarding, then the
introduction of a layer-3 forwarding interface between GGSN and the SAE
MME/UPE is required. Other packet loss mitigation schemes may not require this
interface.
\- SGSN must be ready to create or delete PDP contexts during the relocation
procedure when UE is moving across UTRAN/GERAN and LTE/SAE Access systems.
\- For mobility from UTRAN/GERAN towards SAE/LTE, steps 8 and 9 in Figure
7.8-5 and 7.8.6 need to be supported between UE and GGSN.
##### 7.8.2.4.3 Impact on baseline RAN Architecture
The baseline RAN architecture handles UE measurements from LTE access system
and addresses LTE access system handover targets.
##### 7.8.2.4.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
The terminal needs to support Mobile IP protocol. And it is FFS whether the
terminal should support both MIPv4 and MIPv6.
#### 7.8.2.5 Alternative solution D
##### 7.8.2.5.1 Description
This solution is based on Alternative solution C. the main different point
should be highlighted here are:
\- the UE won\'t need to support Mobile IP by using Proxy Mobile IP solution
(e.g. draft-sgundave-mip6-proxymip6-00 [17]);
\- the radio resource can be saved, because of hiding of the MIP signalling
over radio interface.
The following figure describes this alternative solution. The source MME/UPE
and target MME/UPE are 2G/3G MME/UPE and SAE MME/UPE respectively, or vice
versa.
NOTE: The Proxy based Mobile IP mechanism is a kind of network layer mobility
management mechanism. The detail of this Proxy based mechanism is FFS,

1\. The IP bearer service is established between the UE and the inter AS
Anchor via the source radio network and the source MME/UPE.
2\. The source radio network decides to initiate a handover to the target
radio network.
3\. The source radio network indicates the handover request and handover
target to its source MME/UPE.
4\. The source MME/UPE sends a Handover Preparation Request to the target
MME/UPE, including the necessary UE MM context (such as UE IP address, UE ID,
and security parameters, etc).
5\. The target MME/UPE forwards the Handover Preparation Request to the target
radio network.
6\. The target radio network sets up the user plane to the target MME/UPE for
the UE. The detail process is FFS.
7\. The target radio network confirms the Handover Preparation to the target
MME/UPE.
8\. Upon receiver the PMIP registration response, the target MME/UPE will
confirm the handover preparation with the source MME/UPE.
9\. The source MME/UPE sends the Handover Command to the source radio network.
And the new Care-of Address will be passed to the source radio network.
10\. The source radio network forwards the Handover Command message to the UE
to indicate it to switch to the target radio network.
11\. Data loss may be minimised, e.g. by bi-casting or data forwarding. If the
bi-casting mechanism is assumed, the procedure of updating routing information
(e.g. the procedure is similar to step 14 and step 15 as below) would be
performed between step 7 and step 8.
12\. The Radio Bearer is established between the UE and the target radio
network. After that, the UE will receive the packets via the target radio
network.
13\. The target radio network informs the target MME/UPE about the handover
completion.
14\. The target MME/UPE sends the Mobile IP Registration Request Message to
the Inter AS Anchor instead of the UE, which is called Proxy MIP Registration
Request. The Care-of Address in the message can be the IP address of the
target MME/UPE or the one which the target MME/UPE gets via a DHCP server.
15\. The Inter AS Anchor adds a new binding item for the UE and then sends
back the Registration Response Message to the target MME/UPE to confirm the
registration.
16\. The target MME/UPE forwards the Handover Completion to the source
MME/UPE.
17\. The user plane between the source MME/UPE and the source radio network

MME/UPE.
19\. Location update procedure will be done between the new MME/UPE and the
HSS.

solution C. The additional impact is 2G/3G MME/UPE and SAE MME/UPE should
support the Proxy Mobile IP solution.

### 7.8.3 Inter access system handover between 3GPP and non 3GPP access
systems
#### 7.8.3.1 Description of key issue -- Inter access system handover between
3GPP and non-3GPP access systems
The common denominator between 3GPP and non-3GPP access systems is that
connectivity to packet services is delivered through the IP layer.
In this key issue, the term global mobility protocol is used to describe a
mobility protocol that handovers between 3GPP and non-3GPP access systems, and
the term global mobility is used to describe mobility where the mobility
anchor point for handovers between 3GPP and non-3GPP access systems are
involved. The term local mobility protocol is used to describe a protocol that
manages handovers within a non-3GPP access system. The local mobility protocol
could be Proxy MIP [17] or the mobility protocol specified within the IETF
NETwork based Localized Mobility Management (NETLMM) WG.
The solution presented in this clause is based on the use of Mobile IP (MIP)
as a global mobility protocol providing host-based IP mobility, which is in
required whenever network-based mobility support is not provided. Depending on
operator requirements and/or deployment scenarios, network-based mobility
protocols could be used as local or global mobility protocols in combination
with MIP, as described in clause 7.8.3.3.
#### 7.8.3.2 Solution of key issue -- Inter access system handover between
3GPP and non-3GPP access systems
##### 7.8.3.2.1 Relationship with SAE architecture
Editor's note: This clause identifies the dependencies of this key issue with
the SAE architecture, and will be revised when the functional grouping in the
Evolved Packet Core is agreed.
The following illustrates the handovers that are within the scope of this key
issue, and the related parts in the SAE architecture. Mobility anchor points
in the Evolved Packet Core include the following functions:
\- LTE anchor (corresponding to the anchor for LTE): The anchor point for
intra-LTE mobility. This mobility mechanism is addressed separately (mainly in
the RAN WGs).
\- 3GPP anchor (corresponding to GGSN in pre-SAE/LTE GPRS): The anchor point
for handovers between 3GPP access systems. This mobility mechanism is
addressed in a separate key issue.
\- SAE Anchor (corresponding to HA in the case of MIP): Represents functions
grouped around the anchor point for handovers between 3GPP and non-3GPP access
systems for the mobility protocols and mechanisms described in this key issue.
This anchor allocates IP address(es) for the UE as required by the used
mobility protocol (FFS).
The integration of the anchor points with each other and with other evolved
packet core functions is FFS and is handled in other key issues (clause 7.11,
Functions in the evolved packet core, and clauses 4.2 and 4.3, Architecture
for the evolved system -- non-roaming and roaming cases). Thus, the final
solution needs to be aligned with the above key issues.
Non-3GPP inter access system mobility requires consideration of policy and
charging control from the home operator, as the controlled service may cross
operator as well as access system boundaries. Supporting such functions using
a similar mechanism for different access types is described in a separate key
issue (clause 7.1, Policy control and Charging).
1\. 3GPP handover. Mobility mechanism defined in different key issue.
2ab/c/d/e. Multi-access handover. Mobility using an IP layer mechanism.
Note1: Grouping of the anchor functions into logical entities UPE and IASA is
FFS.
Note2: It is FFS whether the links between anchor functions imply reference
points or not.
Note3: The non 3GPP IP Access may contain local mobility anchor function.
Note4: The relationship between PDG and the Evolved Packet Core is FFS.
Note5: It is FFS how the architecture is aligned with the roaming case.
Note6: The colours used in the figure do not imply any particular mobility
protocol(s).
Figure 7.8-8: 3GPP and multi-access handover anchor functions.
Figure 7.8-8 shows the 3GPP and inter-access system handovers anchored in the
3GPP anchor function and SAE Anchor, respectively.
The introduced overhead (signaling and user plane transport overhead) and
performance penalties (delays etc., as compared to when the mobility solution
is not activated) should be minimized, especially for 3GPP accesses. By
providing a certain level of interaction between the SAE Anchor and the 3GPP
Anchor within the Evolved Packet Core, the Mobile IP based mobility signaling
and tunneling only needs to be active when the terminal is using a non-3GPP
access technology. This interaction can be achieved by integrating the 3GPP
anchor function and SAE Anchor into a single entity, or with some other
coordination between the 3GPP anchor and the SAE Anchor, so that the UE is at
home (in MIP terminology) while moving within 3GPP accesses.
Without any of these interactions, Mobile IP signaling and tunneling will be
active also when using 3GPP access technologies causing extra signaling as
well as tunneling overhead to user data packets.
Beyond the immediate effects on performance, the integration or separation of
the anchor points have implications, for example, related to the complexity of
the PCC support in the architecture, and the flexibility in the architecture
options available to operators, but that issue is not discussed in this
clause.
The separation of the anchor points may also be considered as a means to make
it easier to potentially introduce support for enhancements such as
hierarchical mobility concept.
Note that a serving access node for non-3GPP IP access (such as a PDG or a
similar entity) may be located in the evolved packet core but is not shown in
the figure. Such an entity would be required in the network-based mobility
concept to update the route on behalf of the UE.
The following points shall also be considered in the selection process of the
above alternatives:
1\. Whether the availability and maturity of the relevant IETF standards
affects the solution preference.
2\. Whether the selection should be aligned with solution selected in non-3GPP
access technologies, e.g., the mobility mechanism selected in the WiMAX forum.
3\. Whether the solution provides satisfactory handover performance.
##### 7.8.3.2.2 Additional solution aspects
Another aspect of the solution is the selection of address, network interface
and IP access service used by the UE for the connection. Destination and
source address selection are functions of the TCP/IP stack and may be out of
scope for SAE (FFS). Network interface selection may utilize a virtual network
interface to hide access changes from the rest of the TCP/IP stack, and this
may also be out of scope for SAE (FFS). The selection of IP access service is
related to SAE access bearers and connectivity to multiple PDNs, which are
described in separate key issues. The solution should align with PDN selection
mechanism of 3GPP access systems.
Furthermore, the solution should allow the use of a SAE Anchor, which is the
anchor for mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP access systems, as an anchor for
mobility between two non-3GPP access systems. Although the specification of
such mechanisms is out of scope for 3GPP, the solution should not preclude
performing this according to a hierarchical mobility concept where the two
non-3GPP access systems support local mobility protocols, given that both
non-3GPP access systems provide sufficient security for handover signalling
and user data traffic.
##### 7.8.3.2.3 MIP version implications
Independent of the above architectural aspects, Mobile Ipv6, Mobile Ipv4 or
both can be used to execute mobility toward non-3GPP accesses. The use of
either MIPv4 or MIPv6 (or both) mostly depends on the expected use of IP
versions and is not strictly based on the merits of the individual Mobile IP
protocol versions.
In the absence of mechanisms addressing the lack of native backwards
compatibility of Mobile Ipv6 with Ipv4, the support for already deployed Ipv4
services and networks results in the following alternatives:
\- A transition (dual stack UE, tunnelling from UE) mechanism is necessary if
accessing Ipv6-only services from an Ipv4-only access network. In order to
avoid transition tunnels over the access network, it may be more feasible to
use MIPv4 with a transition mechanism on the service-side of the HA, such as
protocol translation.
\- Mobility is not possible between Ipv4-only and Ipv6-only access networks.
\- For Ipv4-only services it is possible to use Mobile Ipv4 to avoid an
additional transition mechanism on the \"service-end\" of the HA.
Mobile Ipv4 has similar limitations associated with applicability in the
presence of Ipv6, either in the UE connectivity-side or the service-side of
the HA. However it is worth to note that in the case of Mobile Ipv4 the first
point mentioned above is a reversal of the IP versions in services and access
network, i.e. only relevant in the presence of an Ipv6-only access network.
It is expected that most SAE-capable UEs will have a dual stack supporting
both Ipv4 and Ipv6, and therefore using both MIPv4 (for Ipv4 connections) and
MIPv6 (for Ipv6 connections) is possible. This will however require additional
mobility signalling at handover. The cost to administer two mobility protocols
in parallel may also be higher due to additional configuration (e.g. in order
to manage security associations) in the UE and HA. If local network
optimizations are used, they may need to be implemented for both MIPv4 and
MIPv6.
Another possible approach is to adopt dual-stacked Mobile Ipv6 (DS-MIPv6)
solution which is being drafted in IETF (draft-ietf-
mip6-nemo-v4traversal-01.txt). When this solution is available, it will allow
connectivity and mobility across any IP version, and access to services of any
IP version, without additional transition (tunnelling) mechanisms. The
solution is not particularly well suited for Ipv4-only terminals, but
adaptation of the solution could be studied further if needed. It should be
noted that the MIPv6 solution with Ipv4 extensions can be deployed in today\'s
Ipv4 networks, and does not require deployment of Ipv6 in existing networks.
In summary, the following implementation alternatives are possible to enable
mobility for both Ipv4 and Ipv6 (the effect of PDG on these alternatives is
FFS):
1\. MIPv4 and DS-MIPv6
Consequences: two protocols need to be supported in the mobility anchor and in
the mobile node (UE).
2\. DS-MIPv6 only
Consequences: not compatible with MIPv4 only clients.
3\. MIPv4 and MIPv6
Consequences: two protocols and architecture need to be supported in the
mobility anchor. Not possible to serve Ipv6 traffic over an Ipv4 access
network (and vice versa). Mobility between Ipv4 and Ipv6 access networks is
not supported.
##### 7.8.3.2.4 Use of local mobility protocols
A further possibility is the use of a hierarchical mobility concept including
a global mobility protocol and a local mobility protocol. The global mobility
protocol handles mobility events across access systems by associating the
global IP address with the new local IP address at a fixed global mobility
anchor, and forwarding UE traffic to the local IP address allocated by an
access system. UE handovers within the access system are managed using a local
mobility management protocol.
In Mobile IP, the UE obtains a care-of-address (CoA) and performs a MIP
registration with the HA (SAE Anchor) to bind its current CoA to the HoA. In
the hierarchical mobility concept (network-based mobility), the local mobility
anchor sends a Route Update towards a global mobility anchor (SAE Anchor)
triggered, for example, by IP Bearer Establishment signalling between the UE
and the local mobility anchor. The global IP address of the UE does not
change.
In summary, the following alternatives are possible:
1\. MIP as a global mobility protocol, without an additional local mobility
protocol, using only a common Home Agent.\ [Consequences:]{.underline} UE
needs to perform mobility signalling with every handover in the access-
network. There is overhead from Mobile IP tunnelling when the UE is not
performing handovers between access systems.
2\. MIP as a global mobility protocol and one of the local mobility protocols
in the non-3GPP access system, using both a common Home Agent as a global
mobility anchor, and separate local mobility anchors for the access-system.\
[Consequences:]{.underline} There is less overhead and less signalling between
the UE and the network when the local mobility protocol is used. Note that
unless the local mobility protocol is used as the LTE mobility mechanism,
there is no improvement for the UE when performing handovers between access
systems, moreover not all non-3GPP access networks support the particular
local mobility protocol.
3\. One of the network-based mobility protocols (as a global mobility protocol
and any local mobility protocol supported in the access system), using SAE
Anchor as a global mobility anchor and separate local mobility anchors for
each access system. MIP is used for access systems that do not support the
selected network-based mobility protocol. Note that this means that the
network-based mobility anchor for global mobility and the MIP HA both are
located in the SAE Anchor.\ [Consequences:]{.underline} There is less overhead
and less signalling between the UE and the network when the UE is not
participating in network-based mobility signalling, which also reduces the
need for security credentials shared between the UE and the global mobility
anchor. However, if MIP is used for access systems that do not support the
network-based mobility protocol, such security credentials are still needed in
the UE. Network domain security can be used to secure signalling over an
untrusted network (e.g. between HPLMN and VPLMN). There are potential security
concerns (from the perspective of user plane confidentiality and network
topology hiding) if operator decides to allow handover to/from WLAN Direct IP
Access.
#### 7.8.3.3 Comparison of different mobility management schemes
The following alternatives are currently considered for mobility between 3GPP
and Non-3GPP systems:
[Host-based Mobility Management Solutions]{.underline}

2\. MIPv4 with Co-CoA [23]
3\. MIPv6 [24]

6\. DSMIPv4 [32]
[Network-based Mobility Management Solutions]{.underline}
7\. NETLMM [12]
8\. PMIPv4 [26]
9\. PMIPv6 [17, 33]
The main SAE requirements listed in clause 5 for the evolved 3GPP Mobility
Management are applicable for mobility between 3GPP and Non-3GPP systems as
follows:
Requirement 1: The Evolved 3GPP Mobility Management solution shall be able to
accommodate terminals with different mobility requirements (e.g.: fixed,
nomadic and mobile terminals).
Requirement 2: The Evolved 3GPP Mobility Management should allow optimized
routing for user-to-user traffic (including communication towards Internet and
PSTN users, e.g.: via local break-out) and in all roaming scenarios (e.g.:
when both users are in a visited network).
Requirement 3: The Evolved 3GPP System shall support Ipv4 and Ipv6
connectivity. Interworking between Ipv4 and Ipv6 terminals, servers and access
systems shall be possible. Mobility between access systems supporting
different IP versions should be supported.
Additional SAE requirements listed (not specific to mobility management) in
clause 5 that should be considered:
Requirement 4: Transport overhead needs optimization, especially for the last
mile and radio interfaces.
Editor's Note: The above list is not complete and further requirements can be
added.

## 7.9 Key Issue -- Default IP Access Service
### 7.9.1 Description of Key Issue -- Default IP Access Service
The Default IP Access Service provides the basic \"always-on\" IP packet
bearer service. It is expected to be used for user data that do not require
any service specific policies or charging rules. Such user data are, for
example, satisfied by default QoS and flat rate/bundled charging, as described
in a separate Key Issue. The Default IP Access Service is described by a
default context in the network, and possibly in the UE. User data requiring
service specific policies or charging are supported by additional IP access
services.
The Default IP Access Service is established for a UE immediately after the
subscriber has been authenticated and authorized by the network. The Default
IP Access Service provides the UE with Ipv6 and/or Ipv4 connectivity to
operator services, other Ues, private IP networks, or the Internet. The
Default IP Access Service supports mobility of the terminal.
The Default IP Access Service includes the establishment of the default SAE
Bearer as part of the attach procedure. Optionally, the establishment of one
or more dedicated SAE Bearers may be triggered by the completion of the attach
procedure. The establishment of these additional bearers is determined by
operator policy and may be based on subscription information.
NOTE: For example, a dedicated Non-GBR bearer (\"signalling bearer\") could be
pre-established by the network in addition to the default bearer to carry only
the SIP signalling. In addition, another dedicated Non-GBR bearer (\"premium
bearer\") could be pre-established by the network to provide a \"bit pipe\"
service with \"better than default QoS\" but within limits of the user\'s
subscribed QoS level. PCC rules associated with such a \"premium bearer\"
would allow multiple service data flows with the same QoS requirements to be
carried over it.
### 7.9.2 Solution for Key Issue -- Default IP Access Service
\- A Default IP Access Service in the serving (access) network is established
within a single attach procedure that includes authentication and
authorization of the user. It shall be possible that any user specific
information about the Default IP Access Service, such as policies or
configuration parameters, are received from the subscriber databases in home
network, such as HSS or/and Subscription Profile Repository.
\- It is FFS how the subscriber-specific policies or configuration parameters
are transferred from the home network to the serving (access) network.
\- The Default IP Access Service for roaming users in the serving (access)
network can be modified by the home operator.
\- The Default IP Access Service shall provide the UE with at least one Ipv6
address or one Ipv4 address allocated or assigned by the network, together
with necessary IP configuration parameters.
\- It is FFS how Default IP Access Service(s) provide Ipv6 and/or Ipv4
connectivity for a dual stack UE.
\- It is FFS whether the IP address is allocated or assigned statically or
dynamically.
\- The Default IP Access Service(s) shall provide IP connectivity to the
networks permitted under applicable policies and roaming restrictions without
excluding local breakout.
\- For roaming case, whether the default IP address can be allocated by VPLMN
or HPLMN should be based on the home operator\' roaming policy and the roaming
agreement between home operator and visited operator.
NOTE: If the default IP address is allocated by HPLMN, this IP address should
be the home address in the case of MIP solution.

IMS services is provided to the UE within the Default IP Access Service.

## 7.10 Key issue -- IP connectivity with multiple PDNs
### 7.10.1 Description of Key Issue -- IP connectivity with multiple PDNs
According to 3GPP UMTS standards, the scenario where the UE has access (either
concurrently or successively) to several Packet Data Networks or Service
Domains is possible, using one or more GGSNs as requested by the MS. Each
PDN/Service Domain is identified by an Access Point Name (APN) as defined in
TS23.003. The SGSN resolves the APN to an address that identifies a GGSN, and
the GGSN can resolve the PDN/Service Domain. If that GGSN is unavailable, the
APN name resolution normally provides a second choice GGSN address.. In the
following, the term IP Gateway is used to describe the function with the
capability of connecting with PDNs/Service Domains.
This key issue clarifies whether the UE will have a relation to a single or
multiple IP Gateways in order to obtain concurrent connectivity to several
PDNs/Service Domains, and whether one or multiple IP addresses are provided by
an IP Gateway.
Figure 7.10-1: Multi-APN support in pre-SAE/LTE access systems
It should be studied whether and how the SAE architecture can support the
following non-exhaustive list of use cases, or combination of use cases:
**1\. UE accesses a single PDN** : This is not a use case involving multiple
PDNs/Service Domains, but is included for the purpose of comparisons with the
solutions presented in other use cases.\ **Assumptions:** It is anticipated
that a UE will typically have connectivity to only a single PDN at a time.
This always-on IP connectivity is enabled by establishing a basic IP service
during the Network Attachment procedure.
**2\. UE accesses both Ipv4 and Ipv6 PDNs** : A UE could access both Ipv4 and
Ipv6 PDNs/Service Domains, e.g. if Ipv4 and Ipv6 traffic is routed from the UE
to Ipv4 and Ipv6 server clusters in different physical locations.\
**Assumptions:** It is anticipated that support of concurrent Ipv4 and Ipv6
service usage is still needed because of legacy Ipv4 support and new Ipv6
services.
**3**. **Corporate PDN and IMS services in separate trust domains:** Corporate
employees may wish to use the LTE/SAE access system available in corporate
premises for access to corporate services, while using the UE for IMS based
telecommunications such as phone calls. The IMS traffic should comply with the
requirements of the operator trust domain in order to secure charging and LI
while the corporate traffic should be securely and efficiently routed.\
**Assumptions:** It is anticipated that access to corporate services needs to
be securely separated.
**4\. Corporate PDN and other services in separate trust domains** : When
working remotely away from the corporate site, a corporate employee may access
corporate services. This corporate traffic should remain securely separated
from other PDNs/Service Domains such as public Internet, or Device Management
to the UE performed by the home operator.\ **Assumptions:** It is anticipated
that access to corporate services needs to be securely separated.
**5**. **UE mobility between access systems** : UE mobility between access
systems such as LTE, 2G/3G or I-WLAN, or between operators.\ **Assumptions:**
It is anticipated that mobility between 3GPP access systems and between 3GPP
and non-3GPP access systems needs to be efficiently supported. The detailed
performance requirements are described in other key issues.
**6\. Roaming cases** : In some roaming cases, the UE could use the VPLMN for
access to visited network services such as public Internet or IMS emergency
sessions (for pre-SAE/LTE access systems TR 23.867 requires a globally
dedicated APN), while operator services can also be provided in the HPLMN.\
**Assumptions:** It is anticipated that the home network informs the current
visited network of the UE about whether access to local PDNs other than the
PDNs connected to the home network, including visited services or local
breakout, is supported. The allowance of the access to the visited services
and/or local breakout is based on agreements between the visited and home
operators, and the user's subscription.
**7\. Separate private address spaces** : Some of the PDNs/Service Domains may
use private address spaces instead of public addresses.\ **Assumptions:** It
is anticipated that the private address spaces of the multiple PDNs/Service
concurrently accessed by a UE may overlap with each other.
Based on the above use cases, concurrent access to several PDNs/Service
Domains appears to be required in SAE.
Consistent behaviour for applications across different access technologies
should also be considered.
The configuration describing the connectivity of a UE to a set of PDNs/Service
Domains may be received from the HSS/HLR, pre-configurations in the IP
Gateway, by mediation of PCC mechanisms, or a combination of these mechanisms.
The UE need not be aware of the default configuration that provides default
PDN/Service Domain connectivity to the UE, but the UE may request a
configuration to be used instead of that default configuration for other
connectivity than the default PDN/Service Domain. The use of configuration
other than the default configuration depends upon operator configuration and
the user\'s subscription.
### 7.10.2 Solution for Key Issue IP connectivity with multiple PDNs
#### 7.10.2.1 Working Assumptions
When the UE operates using multiple PDNs there will be only one UPE in the
evolved packet core per UE that terminates user plane protocols for header
compression and ciphering, and initiates paging.
Regarding the proposed solution alternatives, the following concerns should be
considered due to the working assumption above:
\- Under the assumption above the user plane data for UEs connected to
multiple PDNs may for some PDNs be routed via two user plane nodes in the
evolved packet core network as opposed to one node in the single PDN case.
\- Depending on migration, deployment scenarios and performance there may be a
need to perform functions like charging, policing etc. in the nodes
terminating the Gi interface.
\- For proposed solutions relying on MIP4 (RFC 3344) and MIP6 (RFC 3775) on
the S5/S8 reference points this working assumption implies that the UPE shall
support both Ipv4 and Ipv6. This is not needed if dual-stack MIPv6 is used.
\- The UPE (terminating ciphering etc.) will be selected when the UE connects
to the first PDN (i.e. at Attach). The UPE may be optimised for that PDN (e.g.
it may be combined with a IASA, and be a complex node that supports Flow Based
Charging, content control, etc, for services such as MMS/IMS). If a second PDN
connection is needed for access to, for example, a corporate customer using
end-to-end encryption and high-volume traffic, the same node has to be reused,
while in a multiple UPE scenario, a different and less complex UPE and IASA
could be used for this second PDN connection.
\- The use of a single UPE per UE may cause the UPE to be moved physically
closer to the radio interface than current GGSNs. The impact of this on
operators is unclear. This should be considered as part of the migration
discussion.
The assumption and the detailed functional allocation between the different
user plane nodes will be further elaborated with the addition of more use
cases for multiple PDNs.
#### 7.10.2.2 Solution alternatives
This chapter is a work in progress. It is FFS how the solutions interwork with
pre-SAE systems.
It is important that the solutions to use cases minimize the complexity of the
mechanisms required for managing multiple configurations and contexts in the
UE and the network, which currently involves multiple APNs and PDP addresses
in the UE.
IP connectivity with multiple PDNs to each of the described use cases can be
provided with one or more of the following solution alternatives.
\- **Single Ipv4 and Ipv6** access service supporting concurrent Ipv4 and Ipv6
addresses and service usage for dual stack terminals. When used, this saves
network resources and removes the need for UE to select the correct access
service depending on the IP version. The UE is aware of the IP version(s)
supported by each access service.
\- **Single APN configuration:** The term Single APN signifies access to one
or more PDNs/Service Domains from the UE point of view (and may include
traffic separation rules) supporting all types of PDNs, i.e. Operator PDN,
Corporate or Private PDN and also Public Internet PDN. This allows the
connectivity for a UE to be provided using only one APN which has the same
structure as APN in the IP Gateway. User data traffic separation into the
different PDNs can be performed in the network and be transparent to the UE.
\- **Network based selection** of the single APN configuration to be used for
the UE in the IP Gateway based on subscription information, or potentially by
policy control means. Allowed access for the UE can be defined per APN.
\- **UE indication of IP version** of access service to the IP Gateway when
establishing a new SAE bearer service, i.e. whether the IP access service is
iPv4, Ipv6 or both.
\- **UE indication of a specific additional APN** to the IP Gateway, e.g. if
needed for emergency session.
\- **NAT** between the IP Gateway and external PDN in case different address
types and/or ranges are used. NAT enables also access to multiple instances in
parallel, e.g. access to multiple private PDNs at the same time. Internet PDN
uses public IP addresses, whereas operator and corporate/private PDNs may use
private or public addresses. NAT enables access to multiple private address
spaces and may include interoperability between Ipv6 and Ipv4. Providing NAT
functionality in the IP Gateway can also improve service access by providing
to the UE all services, including corporate services via e.g. L2TP tunnel,
within the operator PDN IP address space. Awareness of NAT in the UE and
effects to network management need to be considered. Generally mandatory usage
of NAT and NAT like devices is discouraged due to various concerns, some of
which are documented in the TR 23.981.
\- **Routing** of IP packets in the UE between applications and IP connections
in order to handle overlapping IP address spaces, or service access over
multiple network interfaces.
\- **VPN client in UE** with support for NAT traversal on top of LTE/SAE
access to establish a secure tunnel to a Corporate or Private PDN. The client
can use split tunnelling by downloading specific network routes that allow it
to route only the Corporate or Private PDN traffic to the tunnel.
\- **Network based VPN** similar to specifications in TS 29.061 and TS 29.161.
\- **Operator policies** on QoS and flow based charging may be applied to
differentiate between services. In the case of split tunnelling in UE, this
can be applied in conjunction with forced routing to specific next-hop routers
to differentiate between the non-tunneled and VPN tunnelled traffic.
\- **IP access service via SAE anchor** node(s) for 3GPP HO between 3GPP
accesses when the SAE capable UE is in pre-SAE/LTE 3GPP access system and SAE
anchor(s) is available, and not towards pre-SAE/LTE GGSN. This allows the UE
to make handovers between 3GPP access systems.
NOTE 1: This has dependencies with key issue 7.8.2
\- **IP access service via SAE anchor** node(s) for non-3GPP HO between 3GPP
and non-3GPP access when the SAE capable UE is in non-3GPP access systems and
SAE anchor(s) is available. This allows the UE to make handovers between 3GPP
and non-3GPP access systems.
NOTE 2: This has dependencies with key issue 7.8.3
\- **Dedicated IP Gateway** may be used for each PDN/Service Domain by routing
the user plane via the IP Gateway for that PDN/Service Domain.
NOTE 3: User plane is always routed via an IP Gateway and UE needs to support
at least one IP Address per PDN
\- **Mobile IP tunnel:** Mobile IP (MIP) tunnelling is used to reach the
external PDN, where IASA containing a MIP Home Agent (MIP HA) serves as a
gateway to the PDN. There are as many IASAs (i.e. MIP Has) as there are
different external PDNs in parallel. The MIP Care-of Address (CoA) is assigned
from the UPE address space. The MIP Home Address (HoA) to access each
particular external PDN is allocated from the PDN address space. Both MIP4 and
MIP6 may be supported simultaneously (requiring dual stack UPE), or
alternatively, DS MIP6 may be used instead. In the non-roaming case, the
reference point S5 between UPE and IASA is exhibited only when the UPE has no
direct access to a particular PDN. When using a non-3GPP IP access, the UE can
access multiple PDNs via multiple instances of the MIP based S2 reference
point which has identical functionality as S5 and S8.
NOTE 4: This has dependencies with key issue 7.8.3
NOTE 5: User plane is always routed via a Home Agent and UE needs to support
at least one Home Address per PDN
Figure 7.10-2: Mobile IP tunnel solution in roaming case
\- **Proxy MIP:** SAE-capable UE can get access to multiple PDNs using
different IP addresses (Home Address) assigned by different IASAs. An IASA can
be implemented as a Mobile IP Home Agent (HA) and the address assignment can
be performed using Proxy Mobile IP signalling, with MME/UPE acting as a Proxy
MIP (P-MIP) Client. The proposed solution works both with IPv4, Ipv6 and Dual
stack Has. The P-MIP signalling can be used to get a PDN IP address (Home
Address) obtained at network attachment or based on explicit PDN IP address
request (e.g.: using DHCP negotiation) from the UE. Data from UE are sent
directly to the UPE using the Home Address as source address. Then UPE
encapsulates packets towards the correct IASA.
NOTE 6: Access to multiple PDNs from a non-3GPP system with this solution
requires P-MIP support in the non-3GPP system
NOTE 7: This has dependencies with key issue 7.8.3
NOTE 8: User plane is always routed via a Home Agent and UE needs to support
at least one Home Address per PDN
Figure 7.10-3: Proxy MIP solution
\- **NAT Solution:** It is not possible or very inefficient to support the
corporate services by tunneling between UE and corporate. The solution uses
the single APN approach that supports all types of PDNs, i.e. Operator PDN,
Corporate or private PDN and also Public Internet PDN. NAT enables also
interoperation between the different PDNs in case different address types and
or ranges, and in case of access to multiple private PDNs at the same time. An
APN defines the concurrent access possibilities to different PDNs. Allowed
access is defined per APN and controlled by subscription or policy control
means. PDNs may use Ipv4 or Ipv6 addresses. Internet PDN uses public IP
addresses. User data traffic separation into the different PDNs is performed
in the network only.

## 7.11 Key Issue -- Functions in the evolved packet core
### 7.11.1 Description of Key Issue -- Functions in the evolved packet core
The functions in the evolved packet core (as defined by Figure 4.2-1) are
listed below. Depending on the deployment scenario, some of these functions
might be optional. Note that this is not the exhaustive list of the all
functions required in the evolved packet core and other functions identified
later can be added.
\- IP access service enabling functions such as IP address allocation.
\- Packet routing and forwarding, including management and storage of user
plane UE context describing IP bearer service and internal routing
information.
\- Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) based on TS 23.203,
including termination of Gx+ interface according to the PCC architecture and
termination of the Gy = Ro interface with the on-line charging server.
\- Collection of Charging Information for online or offline charging systems,
including support for bearer and flow based charging for IP services, and for
session based services.
\- Mobility Anchor for mobility between different 3GPP based accesses (SAE/LTE
and pre-SAE/LTE).
\- Mobility Anchor for mobility between 3GPP accesses and non 3GPP accesses.
\- Management and storage of UE control plane context, including generation of
a temporary identity and mapping it to a permanent identity (e.g. IMSI).
\- Mobility management, including determination of tracking areas and allowed
PLMNs for handovers, and registration and tracking of LTE_IDLE state Ues.
\- Authentication, authorization and key management, including HSS/AAA
interaction.
\- Lawful interception of user plane traffic.
\- Lawful interception of signaling traffic.
\- Gateway functionality to external networks, including support for Network
Address Translation (NAT) and Firewall.
\- Content control, etc.
\- Multicasting traffic to multiple Ues.
The following functions are above eNodeB, and therefore in the evolved packet
core if the RAN has no other entities than eNodeB. If there are other RAN
entities than eNodeB, their inclusion is FFS:
\- Ciphering termination for user plane traffic.
\- Ciphering/integrity termination for NAS signaling.
\- IP Header compression.
Inclusion of the following functions is FFS:
\- Termination of LTE_IDLE state UE traffic on the downlink data path and
paging requests.
To have a concrete architecture of the evolved packet core, the grouping of
the functions into functional entities in the evolved packet core needs to be
studied.
### 7.11.2 Solution for Key Issue -- grouping of the functions
#### 7.11.2.1 Allocation of evolved packet core functions to UPE, MME and
Inter-AS Anchor
The below non-exhaustive lists present the allocation of evolved packet core
functions to logical entities, for the purposes of comparing the grouping
alternatives. This does not preclude solution alternatives that co-locate one
or more of the logical entities. Depending on the deployment and roaming
scenarios, some of these functions might be optional.
The UPE consists of the following functions:
\- Packet routing and forwarding: For intra-UPE handovers without MME change,
the control for eNB to UPE tunnel movement occurs directly between the eNB and
UPE without passing through the MME;
\- Depending on solution: allocation of a local IP address from the UPE
address space for use by mobility mechanisms;
\- FFS: Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) based on TS 23.203 for
roaming scenarios;
\- Depending on solution: Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF)
based on TS 23.203 for route optimisation scenarios;
\- Depending on solution: Collection of Charging Information for online or
offline charging systems for roaming with home routed traffic. The UPE
generates CDRs and delivers CDRs to charging systems without passing MME;
\- Depending on solution: Collection of Charging Information for online or
offline charging systems when route optimisation is applied. The UPE generates
CDRs and delivers CDRs to charging systems without passing MME;
\- Ciphering termination for user plane traffic;
\- IP Header compression;
\- Depending on solution: Lawful interception of user plane traffic. LI data
are delivered without passing MME; LI control on UPE is independent from MME;
\- Inter-eNodeB Mobility Anchor for user plane;
\- Depending on solution: inter-3GPP access system Mobility Anchor;
\- Trigger/initiation of paging when downlink data arrive for the UE in
LTE_IDLE state.
\- FFS: Routing path establishment/change with IASA
The MME consists of the following functions. In some architecture solution
alternatives, these functions may be co-located with the UPE:
\- Management and storage of UE control plane context;
\- Mobility management;
\- Authentication, authorization (PLMN, TA) and key management;
\- Lawful interception of signaling;
\- The MME terminates and handles UE NAS signaling; NAS signaling is not
relayed via UPE; NAS signaling means direct signaling between UE and entities
above eNB;
\- Ciphering/integrity termination for UE NAS signaling;
\- Management and allocation of temporary user identities;
\- Depending on solution: control plane function for inter-3GPP access system
mobility.
The Inter-AS Anchor consists of the following functions. In some architecture
solution alternatives, these functions may be co-located with the UPE:
\- Packet routing and forwarding;
\- Depending on solution: Authentication, authorization and key management,
for mobility management signaling or for PDN access control;
\- Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) based on TS 23.203;
\- Collection of Charging Information for online or offline charging systems;
\- Generation of CDRs and delivery to charging systems;
\- Mobility Anchor for mobility between 3GPP accesses and non 3GPP accesses;
\- Gateway functionality to PDN including IP address allocation from PDN
address space;
\- Depending on solution: inter-3GPP access system Mobility Anchor;
\- Lawful interception of user plane traffic.

## 7.12 Key Issue QoS concepts
### 7.12.1 Terminology
The term _Application Function_ (AF) is defined in TS 23.207 [19]. The terms
_Policy and Charging Rules Function_ (PCRF) and _Policy and Charging
Enforcement Function_ (PCEF) are defined in TS 23.203 [20].
A _dedicated SAE bearer_ is associated with uplink packet filters in the UE
and downlink packet filters in the PCEF where the filters only match certain
packets. A _default SAE bearer_ is associated with "match all" uplink and
downlink packet filters in the UE and the PCEF, respectively.
An SAE bearer is referred to as a _GBR SAE bearer_ if dedicated network
resources related to a Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) value that is associated with
the SAE bearer are permanently allocated (e.g. by an admission control
function in the eNB) at SAE bearer establishment/modification. Otherwise, an
SAE bearer is referred to as a _Non-GBR SAE bearer_.
A dedicated SAE bearer can either be a GBR or a Non-GBR SAE bearer. A default
SAE bearer shall be a Non-GBR SAE bearer.
An _operator controlled Rx service_ is a service for which the PCEF receives
from the PCRF service specific uplink/downlink packet filters and service
specific QoS parameters where the QoS parameters have been derived from
information that the PCRF received over the Rx interface from an AF.
An _operator controlled Gx only service_ is a service for which the PCEF
receives from the PCRF service specific uplink/downlink packet filters and
service specific QoS parameters without any interaction across an Rx
interface.
NOTE: A single PCEF may realize any combination of operator controlled Rx and
Gx only services on the same or different SAE bearers.
NOTE: An operator controlled Gx only service may be realized based on a
default SAE bearer or a dedicated Non-GBR SAE bearer. An operator controlled
Gx only service realized based on a dedicated GBR SAE bearer is FFS.
### 7.12.2 Description of Key Issue QoS concepts
The key issue on QoS concepts encompasses the following aspects:
\- Means for providing enhanced QoS for services that require QoS or policies
beyond what the default IP access bearer provides;
\- An SAE/LTE QoS profile that is simple compared to the current UMTS QoS
profile (i.e. UMTS bearer service attributes). Possible simplification through
QoS control based on service classes shall be studied.\ \ At the same time
complex mapping mechanisms between SAE/LTE QoS profile and the UMTS QoS
profile are to be avoided. Multiple mappings between UMTS and SAE/LTE QoS
profiles should not result in QoS changes.
\- Signalling of QoS profiles and signalling for Resource Establishment or
Resource Reservation, including the direction of such signalling procedures
(i.e. Network initiated / UE initiated);
It should also be studied whether/how the current UMTS signalling model can be
simplified by deriving IP bearer level and RAN level QoS and policy
configuration from QoS-related signalling that is performed on application-
level (e.g. IMS). This includes study of the use of per-packet QoS-related
information (e.g. DSCP markings).
### 7.12.3 QoS Concept
The MME/UPE/Inter AS Anchor (Access Gateway -- aGW for short in this clause)
will receive a PCC rule including QoS request from the PCRF each time a new
service is requested by the UE. If the requested QoS can not be provided by
the default IP bearer/connectivity service additional SAE bearer services are
required, details about establishment are FFS.
The aGW receives from the PCRF the details about the end-to-end services that
need to be transferred, i.e. filters describing the IP flows and related QoS
description (at least bit rate information and a \"traffic class\"
representing the delay/priority requirement). The aGW may generate an
aggregate for each traffic class consisting of all the end-to-end-services
that are mapped to the same traffic class and their combined QoS description
(at least bitrate). The eNodeB receives the aggregate QoS descriptions for
each SAE bearer service. Whenever an end-to-end service is going to be
started/terminated/modified, the aGW receives the relevant information,
updates the aggregated QoS description and forwards it to the eNodeB.
Both, UE as well as aGW perform the mapping of the end-to-end-service IP flows
to SAE bearer service(s).
In order to be able to differentiate between packets belonging to different
SAE bearer services the eNodeB and the aGW needs to be aware of the aggregate
QoS description of an SAE bearer. The eNodeB uses it for scheduling (DL) and
policing (UL) and the aGW for policing (DL+UL).
For downlink, the nodeB treats the IP packets according to the aggregate QoS
description of the SAE bearer service. For the uplink, the eNodeB polices each
IP packet against the aggregate QoS description of the SAE bearer service.
NOTE: Potential conflicts between text in this section and the text in Section
7.12.8 may need to be resolved at a later stage.
### 7.12.4 SAE Bearer Service Architecture
Figure 7.12-1: SAE Bearer Service Architecture
It is FFS whether one or multiple AGWs serve a UE.
The SAE bearer service layered architecture is depicted in Figure 7.12-1. The
definition of a bearer service as given in TS 23.107 is still applicable:
\- A bearer service includes all aspects to enable the provision of a
contracted QoS. These aspects are among others the control signalling, user
plane transport and QoS management functionality.
The SAE Bearer Service provides:
\- QoS wise aggregation of IP end-to-end-service flows;
\- IP header compression (and provision of related information to UE);
\- UP encryption (and provision of related information to UE);
\- if prioritised treatment of end-to-end-service signalling packets is
required an additional SAE bearer service can be added to the default IP
service;
\- provision of mapping/multiplexing information to the UE;
\- provision of accepted QoS information to the UE.
The SAE Radio Bearer Service provides:
\- transport of the SAE Bearer Service data units between eNodeB and UE
according to the required QoS;
\- linking of the SAE Bearer Service to the respective SAE Bearer Service.
The SAE Access Bearer Service provides:
\- transport of the SAE Bearer Service data units between aGW and eNodeB
according to the required QoS;
\- provision of aggregate QoS description of the SAE Bearer Service towards
the eNodeB;
\- linking of the SAE Access Bearer Service to the respective SAE Bearer
Service.
### 7.12.5 Granularity of QoS Control
{width="6.090277777777778in" height="2.252083333333333in"}
Figure 7.12-2: Two Unicast SAE Bearers Each Consisting of one SAE Radio Bearer
and one SAE Access Bearer
A Service Data Flow (SDF) is an aggregate set of packet flows (see TS 23.203).
An UpLink Packet Filter (ULPF) in the UE binds an SDF to an SAE Bearer in the
uplink direction, and a DownLink Packet Filter (DLPF) in the PCEF binds an SDF
to an SAE Bearer in the downlink direction.
Each unicast SAE Bearer is associated with one UE and one label (see clause
7.12.6).
There is a one-to-one mapping between an SAE Radio Bearer and an SAE Access
Bearer.
An SAE Bearer (i.e., the corresponding SAE Radio Bearer and SAE Access Bearer)
is the level of granularity for QoS control in an SAE/LTE access system. That
is, SDFs mapped to the same SAE Bearer receive the same treatment (e.g,,
scheduling principle). Providing different QoS to two SDFs thus requires that
a separate SAE Bearer is established for each SDF.
### 7.12.6 The QoS Profile of the SAE Bearer
The SAE QoS profile comprises [only]{.underline} the following QoS parameters:
\- Label
\- GBR (Guaranteed Bit Rate -- UL + DL)
\- MBR (Maximum Bit Rate -- UL + DL)
\- ARP (Allocation and Retention Priority)
An SAE QoS profile is associated with an SAE Bearer. The four parameters of
the SAE QoS profile are only signaled from the MME/UPE to the eNB across S1 in
the control plane at SAE bearer establishment / modification.
In the following we use the terms 'GBR bearer' and 'Non-GBR bearer' as defined
in clause 7.12.1.
A Label is a scalar. The **Label** identifies Label Characteristics used to
derive a **'traffic handling behavior'** in the eNB. It is understood that
operators require consistent traffic handling for specific services; in
particular in a multi-vendor scenario and in a roaming scenario. For that
reason a number of traffic handling behaviors need to be standardized (similar
to the way that the so-called Per-Hop Behaviors are standardized for DiffServ,
e.g. see IETF RFC 2597 [21] and IETF RFC 3246 [22]).
NOTE: A specification of Label Characteristics provides sufficient information
that allows -- together with the other above mentioned signaled QoS parameters
GBR and MBR -- the realization of a particular SAE Radio Bearer in an eNB. For
example, such information may include a reference SAE Radio Bearer
configuration (e.g. à la 34.108, e.g., including RLC mode); scheduling policy;
queue management policy; packet discard timers, etc., etc.
Furthermore, it is understood that the mapping table (Standardized Label →
Label Characteristics) shall be specified in 3GPP specifications.
The **GBR** applies only to GBR bearers.
The **MBR** applies to GBR bearers where MBR may be greater than or equal to
GBR. The signaling of MBR for Non-GBR bearers is FFS. See Section 7.12.8 on
\"Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate\".
GBR and MBR denote bit rates of traffic per SAE bearer while AMBR (see Section
7.12.8) denotes a bit rate of traffic per group of SAE bearers. Each of those
three QoS parameters has an uplink and a downlink component.
The MME/UPE shall modify the values of the GBR, MBR, and AMBR parameters for
the purpose of signaling on S1 to denote bit rates provided to/from \"below\"
the PDCP layer. In this case the GBR, MBR and AMBR refer to a bit stream that
is composed of application level data, transport protocol and network protocol
headers (e.g. TCP, RTP, UDP, IP‑based headers with or without IP‑based header
compression), and PDCP headers.
NOTE: A more precise definition of GBR and MBR, e.g. whether those parameters
only denote a bit rate or additionally also a token bucket size, is left FFS.
The **ARP** applies to both GBR and Non-GBR bearers. The primary purpose of
ARP is to decide whether a bearer establishment / modification request can be
accepted or needs to be rejected in case of resource limitations (typically
available radio capacity in case of GBR bearers). In addition, the ARP can be
used (e.g. by the RAN) to decide which bearer(s) to drop during exceptional
resource limitations. Once successfully established, a bearer's ARP shall not
have any impact on the traffic handling (e.g. scheduling and rate control) of
the traffic carried by the bearer. Such traffic handling should be solely
determined by the other QoS parameters of the SAE QoS profile: Label, GBR,
MBR.
NOTE: The ARP should be understood as \"Priority of Allocation and
Retention\"; not as \"Allocation, Retention, and Priority\". A more precise
definition of ARP, e.g. the encoding of \'retention\', is left FFS.
### 7.12.7 Label Usage Principles
\- Need two levels of mappings: (1) SDF  QCI (S7), and (2) Label  Label
Characteristics:
\- The value of QCI signaled on S7 is identical to the value of Label signaled
on S1
\- (1) FFS (need agreed roaming architecture first): Service Data Flows (SDFs
as defined in PCC) will be mapped to a Label in the HPLMN or VPLMN for SDFs
managed by the HPLMN. That mapping is done in the VPLMN for SDFs managed the
VPLMN (e.g. in case of local breakout)
\- FFS: Need to standardize mapping table \"well-known services\" 
standardized Label(s)
\- (2) Need to standardize mapping table Standardized Label  Label
Characteristics
\- Use RFC4594 as an example for (1) and/or (2)
\- Label Characteristics = \:
NOTE: Admission control can be performed at establishment / modification of a
Non‑GBR SAE bearer even though a Non‑GBR SAE bearer is not associated with a
GBR value (see Section 7.12.6).
\- FFS: define integer values for \'delay budget\' and \'loss tolerance\' or
only \"soft values\" (e.g. low medium, high)
\- FFS: Need for additional elements defining Label Characteristics
(\"other(FFS)\")
\- The mapping standardized Label \'X\'  Label Characteristics will be used
by the operator owning the node (e.g. eNB) to configure node-specific
parameters (e.g. scheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue management
thresholds, RLC configuration, packet delay budget, etc.) associated with an
SAE Bearer that itself is associated with Label \'X\';
\- Standardized Label values need to be assigned by 3GPP;
\- Non-standardized Label values are outside the scope of this TR.
### 7.12.8 Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate
Multiple SAE Bearers can share the same Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (AMBR).
That is, each of those SAE Bearers could potentially utilize the entire AMBR,
e.g. when the other SAE Bearers do not carry any traffic. The AMBR is the
\'subscription MBR\' stored in HSS. The AMBR is signaled from the MME/UPE to
the eNB across S1 in the control plane when the UE connects to the network.
NOTE: It is FFS whether the AMBR will be signalled to the UE (in Access-
Stratum and/or Non-Access Stratum).
NOTE: It is FFS whether the AMBR can be modified from the MME/UPE.
This section outlines the options for the scope of AMBR that will be
considered.
\- Option 1\ AMBR applies to all Non-GBR SAE Bearers of a UE. GBR SAE Bearers
are outside the scope of AMBR. In this case, Non-GBR SAE Bearers do not have a
separate \'per SAE Bearer MBR\'.
\- FFS: Option 2\ AMBR can apply to only some Non-GBR SAE Bearers of a UE.
Independent Non-GBR SAE Bearers can be established with an independent per SAE
Bearer MBR (signaled as part of the SAE bearer\'s QoS profile). GBR SAE
Bearers are outside the scope of AMBR.
NOTE: For option 2 it is left FFS whether multiple groups of Non-GBR SAE
bearers each with an independent AMBR can be defined.
\- FFS: Option 3\ AMBR applies to all SAE Bearers (GBR and Non-GBR).
\- FFS: Option 4\ AMBR can apply to only some SAE Bearers (GBR and Non-GBR).
Independent SAE Bearers (GBR and Non-GBR) can be established with an
independent MBR (signaled as part of the SAE bearer\'s QoS profile).
### 7.12.9 Resource Establishment and QoS Signalling
Resource Establishment and QoS Signalling handle the provisioning of
QoS/policy information to the network entities that control radio/network
resources. Radio/network resources are controlled applying information about
the users\' subscription, the UE\'s and the radio/network capabilities, the
availability of radio/network resources, certain operator policies, and what
services are being used.
It is assumed that resources can always be granted even though the requested
QoS may not, i.e. the QoS can be downgraded by the network/radio. It is FFS to
which extent a negotiation/re-negotiation of requested network resources shall
be possible.
Resource Establishment and QoS Signalling assume a preceding signalling of QoS
requirements. This could be either by application signalling (e.g. IMS) or by
IP bearer signalling. It is FFS if this will lead to the establishment of
additional IP bearers (comparable to UMTS PS bearers).The application
signalling takes place on the already established resources of the default IP
access bearer. An application function performs the negotiation with the UE on
media components and their characteristics and provides the relevant
information to the PCRF.
For operator-controlled services (e.g. IMS) SAE/LTE supports Network-Initiated
SAE Bearer establishment and Network-Initiated SAE Bearer modification, i.e.,
the network controls the SAE Bearer signalling and is thus responsible for
requesting the appropriate bearer QoS parameters.
NOTE: The provisioning of enhanced QoS for non-operator-controlled services is
FFS
NOTE: Support in SAE/LTE for UE-Initiated SAE Bearer establishment and UE-
Initiated SAE Bearer modification is FFS
The Resource Establishment is triggered by a resource request from the PCRF
which translates the media information into the necessary Policy/QoS
information or by IP bearer signalling which contains the Policy/QoS
information. In the latter case it is assumed that the network performs a QoS
authorization beforehand which adds the Policy information to the bearer
signalling. It is FFS whether triggering of the Resource Establishment by the
PCRF should be also supported for non-IMS services.
The Resource Establishment function contains both, the functions that are
needed to setup network and radio resources and the respective signalling
towards the UE to bind the radio resources to the application layer and
provide it with the authorised QoS.
The MME/UPE checks whether the granted resources correspond to the limits
defined in the subscription profile of the user and initiates a resource
assignment towards the radio part of the network.
The responsible LTE-RAN function checks the availability of resources and sets
up the required resources and finally informs the UE on the radio resources
configuration for the service and which resources are linked to which IP or
session flows.
NOTE: Allocation of LTE-RAN functions to logical entities is FFS in RAN WGs.
Figure 7.12-3: Information flow for Resource Establishment in the Radio
Network
1) The UE has a signalling relation established with the network which
performs on the default IP access bearer.
2) The MME/UPE is triggered by a resource request which contains Policy/QoS
Information corresponding to the requested service.
3) The MME/UPE checks the UE\'s subscription, performs admission control
according to the received QoS information and available resources and applies
the received policy information.
NOTE: The location of the policy enforcement point is FFS, it might be located
in the (inter-access-) mobility anchor).
4) MME/UPE initiates the Resource Establishment towards the responsible LTE-
RAN functions.
5) The responsible LTE-RAN functions perform admission control. Translation of
the received QoS information into radio QoS information is expected to be
necessary. The allocation of radio resources and the appropriate configuration
of the scheduler are performed according to the translated QoS information.
6) The UE is provided with information about the radio configuration necessary
for the service and related information to link radio resources with IP or
session flows.
7) The MME/UPE is informed about the successful outcome of the resource
establishment.
8) The MME/UPE reports the outcome of the resource establishment together with
the negotiated QoS.

## 7.13 Key Issue Network Attachment
### 7.13.1 Description of Network Attachment
A UE/user needs to register with the network to receive services that require
registration. This registration is described as Network Attachment. The
always-on IP connectivity for UE/users of the SAE system is enabled by
establishing a basic IP bearer during Network Attachment.
The network keeps UE/user registration information. The UE/user registration
information, e.g. the mapping between temporary and permanent user identities
and the last registered tracking area, is kept by the network for an
(implementation) specific time after the UE/user detached before being deleted
to allow for Network Attachment with user identity confidentiality.
### 7.13.2 Solution for Key Issue Network Attachment
The following information flow shows the network attachment of a UE. (The
dashed entity is involved optionally.) MME and UPE are shown as combined;
though they may be separate (in this case an additional interface must be
realized).
The steps shown in the information flow describe individual functional steps.
This does not preclude any combining of multiple functional steps into one
message or separating one step into a message sequence. The sequence of the
steps shown in the information flow may change depending on the solutions for
related key issues.
Figure 7.13-1: Network Attachment information flow
1) The UE discovers the SAE/LTE access system(s) and performs access system
and network selection. If network sharing is present, a shared network may be
selected. Further details of this process are FFS.
2) The UE sends an attach request to the MME/UPE, including its old
registration information, e.g. temporary identity. If the UE has no old
registration information it includes its permanent identity.
In case of network sharing is applied the attach request includes information
for selecting network or MME/UPE.
The Evolved RAN selects the MME/UPE.
The attach request may include information on Default IP Access Bearer (e.g.
user preferred IP address and APN).
3) If old registration information was sent by the UE the MME/UPE tries to
retrieve user information from the old MME/UPE by sending the old registration
information.
4) The old MME/UPE sends user information, e.g. the permanent user identity,
to the MME/UPE.
5) The user/UE is authenticated in the new MME/UPE.
6) The MME/UPE registers itself as serving the UE in the HSS.
7) The user/UE information in the old MME/UPE is deleted or the user/UE is
marked as not present.
8) The HSS confirms the registration of the new MME/UPE. Subscription data
authorising the Default IP Access Bearer are transferred. Information for
policy and charging control of the Default IP Access Bearer is sent to the
MME/UPE.
9) An Inters AS Anchor is selected. The selection mechanism is FFS. The IP
address configuration is determined by user preferences received from the UE,
by subscription data, or by HPLMN or VPLMN policies.
10) The Inter AS Anchor configures the IP layer with the determined user IP
address. The user plane is established and the default policy and charging
rules are applied. The user plane establishment is initiated by the UE or by
the MME/UPE, which is FFS.
11) The MME/UPE provides the Evolved RAN with QoS configurations for the
Default IP Access Bearer, e.g. the upper limits for transmission data rates.
It is FFS whether this provision of QoS configuration requires an additional
trigger, e.g. the need to transfer uplink or downlink user data.
12) The MME/UPE accepts the UE\'s network attachment and allocates a temporary
identity to the UE. Also the determined user IP address is transferred.
13) Roaming restrictions are checked and if violated the network attachment is
rejected.
14) The UE acknowledges the success of the network attachment.
It shall be possible for a MME/UPE to trigger the UE to reattach (for reasons
like load redistribution, attachment to a topologically more optimal MME/UPE
due to current user location etc.). In this case, the following procedure
would apply:
Figure 7.13-2: Network initiated Re-Attachment information flow
1) The Old MME/UPE requests the UE to re-attach.
2) The UE discovers the SAE/LTE access system(s) and perform access system and
network selection. However, this could be skipped in the case of Re-attachment
required to move the UE to a topologically more optimal MME/UPE.
3) The UE sends an attach request to the MME/UPE, including its old
registration information, e.g. temporary identity. If the UE has no old
registration information it includes its permanent identity.
In case of network sharing is applied the attach request includes information
for selecting network or MME/UPE.
The Evolved RAN selects the MME/UPE.
The attach request may include information on Default IP Access Bearer (e.g.
user preferred IP address and APN).
4) If old registration information was sent by the UE the MME/UPE tries to
retrieve user information from the old MME/UPE by sending the old registration
information.
5) The old MME/UPE sends user information, e.g. the permanent user identity,
to the MME/UPE.
6) The user/UE is authenticated in the new MME/UPE.
7) The MME/UPE registers itself as serving the UE in the HSS.
8) The user/UE information in the old MME/UPE is deleted or the user/UE is
marked as not present.
9) The HSS confirms the registration of the new MME/UPE. Subscription data
authorising the Default IP Access Bearer are transferred. Information for
policy and charging control of the Default IP Access Bearer is sent to the
MME/UPE.
10) An Inters AS Anchor is selected. The selection mechanism is FFS.
11) The Inter AS Anchor configures the IP layer with the determined user IP
address. The user plane is established and the default policy and charging
rules are applied. The user plane establishment is initiated by the UE or by
the MME/UPE, which is FFS.
12) The MME/UPE provides the Evolved RAN with QoS configurations for the
Default IP Access Bearer, e.g. the upper limits for transmission data rates.
It is FFS whether this provision of QoS configuration requires an additional
trigger, e.g. the need to transfer uplink or downlink user data.
13) The MME/UPE accepts the UE\'s network attachment and allocates a temporary
identity to the UE. Also the determined user IP address is transferred.
Roaming restrictions are checked and if violated the network attachment is
rejected.
14) The UE acknowledges the success of the network attachment.
NOTE: It is FFS whether the re-attach procedure includes IP address re-
allocation and Inter AS Anchor re-selection or whether the UE does not change
IP address and Inter AS Anchor during re-attach procedure.

## 7.14 Key Issue Paging and C-plane establishment
### 7.14.1 Description of Key Issue Paging and Evolved RAN C-plane
establishment
The key issue Paging and C-plane establishment handles both, the mobile
terminating and the mobile originating case of C-plane establishment
comprising:
\- in case of mobile terminating case: termination of incoming data packets
for Ues in LTE_IDLE, triggering the paging and distribution of paging over all
cells of the Tracking Area the UE is registered.
\- for the mobile terminating and the originating case: establishment of a
C-plane connection between UE and the network, including the establishment of
radio resources for the default (signalling) IP connectivity service and
possibly for other preserved services for which context data are already
available in the MME/UPE and the UE.
NOTE: There is some relation with \"Key Issue Inter 3GPP Access System
Mobility in Idle State\".
### 7.14.2 Solution for Key Issue Paging and Evolved RAN C-plane establishment
NOTE: It is agreed that paging is initiated from the UPE (rather than from the
eNodeB), provided that the network signalling caused by Ues moving between LTE
ACTIVE and LTE IDLE states is very limited. E.g. by ensuring that Ues in LTE
ACTIVE state have the same power saving capabilities as those in LTE IDLE
state.
A downlink data packet is terminated at the MME/UPE and paging is done within
the cells contained in the Tracking Area the respective user is registered.
The UE requests default radio resources to be able to contact the MME/UPE
either in response to the paging request in the mobile terminating case or for
the mobile originating case. The UPE correlates the incoming data packet with
either the default IP connectivity service or other preserved service
contexts.
The network provides the UE information to the radio functions of the evolved
RAN to perform its services on the radio resources (e.g., necessary
information to allow the UE and network to communicate via scheduling control
channels).
In the information flow below MME and UPE are shown together for simplicity
reasons. This does not preclude a separation, which would however require the
definition of an interface between both entities. In a similar manner all
radio functions have been grouped into a single functional entity \"radio
functions\".
NOTE: Allocation of radio functions to logical entities is FFS in RAN WGs.
Figure 7.14-1: Information flow for paging and C-plane establishment
1) Both, the UE in LTE_IDLE and the MME/UPE the UE is registered hold at least
one preserved service context (i.e. for the default IP connectivity service).
2) The UPE receives a downlink data packet for the UE and discovers that no
connection with UE exists radio resources are yet established.
3) The MME/UPE checks the state of the UE and retrieves the Tracking Area it
is registered.
4) The MME/UPE triggers paging and requests the responsible radio functions to
page the UE in all cells of the Tracking Area the UE is registered.
5) The UE contacts the network using a Radio Resource Connection Request
message containing NAS equivalent information for \"Service Request\". The
Radio functions send the Radio Resource Connection Request message to the
MME/UPE that is serving the UE.
NOTE 1: It might be possible to start to exchange AS equivalent information
for the Security Mode Command function already at this point in time, however,
this is FFS.
6a) The MME/UPE correlates the UE request with the Paging procedure.
6b) If the network accepts the Service Request, it is possible to start data
transmission on default resources.
7) If the network decides to grant requested resources, it issues a Radio
Resource Setup containing NAS equivalent information for \"Service Accept\"
and possibly (network initiated) \"Activate PDP Context request\" and AS
equivalent information for \"Security Mode Command\" and possibly RAB
Assignment request / RB Setup.
8) The UE acknowledges the Radio Resource Setup. This might include the
signalling of NAS equivalent information for \"Activate PDP Context Accept\".
It also includes AS equivalent information for \"Security Mode Complete\" and
possibly \"RAB Assignment Response\"/\"RB Setup Complete\".
NOTE 2: Radio function related details for steps 7) and 8) are further
detailed in the key issue \"Resource Establishment and QoS Signalling\" in TR
25.912.
NOTE 3: Whether it is possible to perform steps 5), 7) and 8) in 2 steps is
FFS.

## 7.15 Key Issue: Intra LTE-Access-System inter MME/UPE handover in the
active mode
### 7.15.1 Description of Key Issue
This key issue is about whether it is advantageous to perform an inter-MME/UPE
handover in case of an intra-LTE handover, and studies different solutions
that can solve this problem.
NOTE: This key issue partially overlaps with key issue Intra LTE-Access-System
handover. It is intended to merge the two key issues once the key issue Intra
LTE-Access-System handover is described in this TR.
NOTE: Depending on the key issue of UP/CP separation, this key issue can be
divided into inter-UPE handover and inter-MME handover.
### 7.15.2 Solution for key issue
#### 7.15.2.1 Alternative 1
##### 7.15.2.1.1 Description
This solution proposes to perform inter-MME/UPE handover in LTE_ACTIVE mode
when:
\- a UE moves a significant distance from its current MME/UPE, and when
\- the active communications are not delay-sensitive.
Whether inter-MME/UPE handoffs for active Ues with delay-sensitive
communications are desirable remains FFS.
**Proposed Solution:**
Inter-MME/UPE handoffs can be achieved through a common \'user plane anchor\'
as illustrated in Figure 7.15-1.
Figure 7.15-1: Intra LTE-Access-System inter-UPE/MME handover
Possible approaches to handle inter-MME/UPE mobility in this solution can be
Mobile IP, NETLMM, etc.
This solution proposes different handoff procedures depending on the type of
communications active on the UE at the time of crossing a MME/UPE service
area.
**Procedure for Ues with non-delay sensitive communications (see Figure
7.15.2):**
\- When the UE crosses a MME/UPE service area boundary, an inter-MME/UPE
handover is performed. A new MME/UPE is selected in the new service area in
the same way as in LTE_IDLE mode mobility. This type of mobility management is
sufficient for terminals without delay sensitive communication requirements.
Figure 7.15.2 illustrates how MME/UPE is re-selected for Ues with non delay-
sensitive communication.

Figure 7.15.2: MME/UPE selection for Active UE with non delay-sensitive
traffic
**Procedure for Ues with delay sensitive communications (see Figure 7.15-3):**
\- When the UE crosses a MME/UPE service area boundary, the original MME/UPE
is maintained and the handoff is performed to a LTE-RAN entity in the new
service area. This is enabled by the S1-flex concept. Only when the UE goes
into LTE_IDLE state, the UE re-registers with a MME/UPE in the new service
area. As part of this process, a new MME/UPE is selected in the new service
area. This type of mobility management is suitable for delay-sensitive
communication (e.g., VoIP), since any perceivable disruption due to MME/UPE
re-selection is avoided. Figure 7.15-3 illustrates how MME/UPE is re-selected
for Ues with delay-sensitive communication.

Since this alternative solution does not intend to change the signalling
sequence for intra-LTE-Access-System inter-MME/UPE handover in LTE_ACTIVE
mode, detailed signalling sequences are not provided.
NOTE: This approach does not preclude that several MME/UPEs serve the same
service area as discussed in the key issue on redundancy and load sharing.

Figure 7.15-5 : intra-LTE MME/UPE Relocation in Active mode
Editor\'s note: transfer of PCC information is FFS
1) The IP bearer service is established between the UE and the IASA via the
MME/UPE1
2) The eNB1 decides to initiates a handover to eNB2
3) The eNB1 sends a Handover Required to the MME/UPE1.
4) The MME/UPE1 selects a MME/UPE2 serving the eNB2 the UE is going to use and
sends it a Handover Preparation Request, including the UE context information.
5) The MME/UPE2 creates a UE context and sends a Handover Preparation Request
to the eNB2. The eNB2 sends a Handover Preparation Confirm to the MME/UPE2.
The bearer plane is established between eNB2 and MME/UPE2
6) The MME/UPE2 sends a Handover Preparation Confirm to the MME/UPE1.
7) Mean to minimize lost of data i.e. MME/UPE1 starts bi-casting to eNB1 and
MME/UPE2 or data forwarding to MME/UPE2.
8) The MME/UPE1 sends a Handover Command to the UE.
9) The UE is detected at the eNB2.
10) eNB2 sends a Handover Complete to the MME/UPE2.
11) The MME/UPE2 does a route update with the IASA.
12) The MME/UPE2 informs MME/UPE1 of the Handover Complete and the possibility
to release resources in previous access. MME/UPE1 now sends all downlink
packets only to the MME/UPE2.
13) The resource in the source system is released.
14) The IP Bearer service is now established between the UE and the IASA via
MME/UPE2.
NOTE: Step 11 above shows a proposal in case of PMIP/GTP solutions and it
would be a route update directly between the UE and IASA in case of MIP use.

## 7.16 Key Issue -- Network Redundancy and Load Sharing
### 7.16.1 Description of Key Issue -- Network Redundancy and Load-sharing
Redundancy is an important factor contributing to the overall reliability of
the network, and load sharing can be used by the operators to improve resource
efficiency. Both redundancy and load-sharing may be achieved by two or more
entities performing the same functions, where the appropriate entity is chosen
as needed. This Key Issue outlines network redundancy and load sharing
solutions over various network nodes and interfaces.
### 7.16.2 General Solutions for key issue -- Network Redundancy and Load-
sharing
In the following text, client entity denotes an entity that uses the services
of a serving entity that employs redundancy or load-sharing mechanisms.
In one potential solution, the client entity attempts to query each serving
entity in a fixed sequence until a serving entity responds, i.e. as long as
the candidate serving entities fail to or refuse to respond to the query. It
is a simple solution but not a flexible one. In order to achieve load sharing,
the list of serving entities used by the client entity should be carefully
configured. This solution is suitable for redundancy scenario, or roughly
load-sharing among a few entities. In case of serving entity failure, it may
take some time for the client entity to find an appropriate substitute serving
entity.
In another potential solution, the sequence of serving entities used by the
client entity is adjustable. The priority of each serving entity in the list
can be reconfigured, e.g. based on history information and current conditions.
Redundancy can be achieved more intelligently. Load sharing can be achieved if
load information can be acquired or deduced. Compared to the first solution,
this solution is suitable for more precise load-sharing among a limited set of
entities. In case of serving entity failure, the time required to find a
substitute serving entity is not reduced compared to the first solution.
In a third potential solution, a \'request and respond\' mechanism is used.
The client entity sends out a request, and the serving entity that responds
faster than the other serving entities are chosen, or the serving entity that
responds with the highest service priority is chosen. This solution can be
used to attain redundancy and load sharing among many entities, while
achieving a more precise load-sharing compared to the first two solutions. The
mechanism makes use of more messages in order to reduce the search time and
improve the precision of load sharing. Multicast/Broadcast may be used to
reduce the number of messages if needed.
Other possible solutions are FFS. For example, the anycast feature of Ipv6 may
be considered.
It is FFS which solution would be used in each different situation.
It is FFS whether redundancy or load-sharing of serving network entities are
needed when the client entity is a UE.
### 7.16.3 S1-flex Concept
#### 7.16.3.1 Description of issue
Support for Network Redundancy and Load Sharing of MME / UPEs in SAE / LTE is
achieved by making the S1 interface a multi-to-multi interface, where one node
in E-UTRAN can be connected to multiple MME / UPEs for different terminals.
This clause is outlining the solutions for this key issue.
#### 7.16.3.2 Assumptions on S1-flex concept
The following assumptions are taken regarding the S1-flex configuration:
1\. There is a multi-to-multi relationship between the E-UTRAN and MME / UPEs
in SAE / LTE, meaning one node in eUTRAN can communicate with different MME /
UPEs and vice versa.
2\. One terminal can only be assigned to one MME at a time.
3\. The MME / UPE will be assigned to the terminal during attach to the
network, and it is FFS whether the MME / UPE will be unchanged until the
terminal leaves the serving area of that MME / UPE.
## 7.17 Key Issue Network Sharing
### 7.17.1 Description of Network Sharing
The key issue Network Sharing presents a way to apply functionality
corresponding to Rel-6 MOCN Network Sharing also to the LTE / SAE / LTE
architecture.
The Rel-6 Network Sharing architecture describes two architectures for network
sharing, the Gateway Core Network (GWCN) configuration and the Multi-Operator
Core Network (MOCN) configuration. In MOCN configurations only the radio
access network is shared, whereas in GWCN configurations also the SGSN and the
MSC are shared. Similar solution as MOCN sharing can in SAE / LTE architecture
be supported where the MME / UPE belongs to each operator and the e-UTRAN is
shared among the operators.
The support of Network Sharing is based on support for multi-to-multi
relationship between nodes in E-UTRAN and MME/UPEs (S1-flex).
### 7.17.2 Solution for Key Issue Network Sharing
#### 7.17.2.1 General
Figure 7.17.2 illustrated the case when 2 operators are sharing the base
station sites (Node B) but having their own MME / UPEs.
Figure 7.17.2: Network Sharing in SAE/LTE based on S1-flex configuration
NOTE: This figure and this key issue uses NB for simplification reasons but
does not make any detailed assumption on the Evolved RAN architecture. Any RAN
details are FFS.
#### 7.17.2.2 S1-flex configuration
The SAE/LTE network sharing function uses multi-to-multi connections between
nodes of E-UTRAN and MME/UPE\'s, \"S1-flex\".
#### 7.17.2.3 Broadcast system information for an SAE/LTE network
Broadcast system information concerning available Operators is included in
each cell in the LTE RAN. In an LTE RAN which is shared by multiple Operators
the broadcast system information contains multiple PLMN-ids (one PLMN-id for
each sharing Operator). An LTE UE decodes this information and takes the
information concerning available Operators into account in network and cell
(re-)selection procedures.
#### 7.17.2.4 Network selection in an SAE/LTE network
Network sharing is an inherent part of the SAE/LTE architecture, both on the
UE and network side. All Ues equipped with the new LTE radio supports network
sharing from the beginning, i.e. any network sharing related information is an
inherent part of the SAE/LTE protocols and is supported by Ues. (With Rel-6
Netshare terminology, all Ues are \"supporting Ues\").
An LTE UE decodes the broadcast system information to determine available
Operators in the network. All Operators indicated in the broadcast system
information, regardless if there are multiple or a single Operator indicated,
are treated equally when the PLMN selection procedure is performed.
#### 7.17.2.5 Assignment of Operator and MME/UPE node
When an LTE UE performs an initial access to a network, it informs the E-UTRAN
of the identity of the Operator it has chosen. The E-UTRAN routes the initial
access to an MME/UPE of the chosen Operator.
After initial access to a shared network the UE does normally not change to
another available Operator as long as the selected Operator is available to
serve the UE\'s location.
When the network signals tracking area identities to Ues, e.g. in location
updating accept messages, these identities shall contain the chosen Operator
identity. The UE stores appropriate information on the SIM, to enable reattach
to the same Operator and MME/UPE again after power-off.
A UE shows the name of the Operator corresponding to the PLMN-id it has
registered with.
#### 7.17.2.6 Accounting in RAN
When an LTE RAN is configured for multiple Operators, the RAN should provide
an accounting function which can determine the resource usage of respective
Operator.

## 7.18 Key Issue Intra-LTE-Access Mobility Support for Ues in LTE_ACTIVE
### 7.18.1 Description of Key Issue Intra-LTE-Access Mobility Support for Ues
in LTE_ACTIVE
The key issue Intra-Access Mobility Handling of Ues in LTE_ACTIVE handles all
necessary steps already known from state of the art relocation/handover
procedures, like processes that precedes the final HO decision on the source
network, preparation of resources on the target network side, pushing the UE
to the new radio resources and finally releasing resources on the (old) source
network side. It contains mechanisms to transfer context data between evolved
nodes, and to update node relations on C- and U-plane.
### 7.18.2 Solution for key issue Intra-LTE-Access Mobility Support for Ues in
LTE_ACTIVE
LTE_ACTIVE state mobility is still controlled by the LTE-RAN functions
currently serving the UE (source LTE-RAN functions) which trigger the HO
process after it has made a definite decision to serve the user by neighbour
(\"target\") LTE-RAN functions.
Means need to be provided to protect against data loss during the handover
process.
After the LTERAN functions on the target side have received the final
confirmation from the UE on the completion of the HO process, the release of
resources on the (old) source side is triggered.
#### 7.18.2.1 C-plane handling
NOTE: The MME/UPE is shown as being co-located in one functional entity for
simplicity reasons; however this is FFS.
Figure 7.18-1: Information flow for Intra-LTE-Access Mobility Support
1) The UE context within the Source RRC contains information regarding roaming
restrictions which where provided either at connection establishment or at the
last TA update.
2) The responsible \"source LTE-RAN functions\" configure the UE measurement
procedures according to the area restriction information.
3) Based on measurement results, probably assisted by additional RRM specific
information the source side decides to handover the UE to a cell controlled by
the \"Target LTE RAN functions\"
4) The target side is requested to prepare the HO on the target side.
5) Resources at the target side are reserved / prepared.
6) The preparation phase has ended successfully.
A) from step 7) until 10) means to avoid data loss during HO are provided and
detailed in TR 25.912 [18]
7) The \"Source LTE-RAN\" functions command the UE to the target side.
8) The UE starts to gain synchronisation on the target side.
9) Once the UE has successfully accessed the cell, the UE sends an indication
to the \"target LTE-RAN functions\" to indicate that the handover is
completed.
10) The HO Complete message is sent to indicate the MME/UPE that the UE is
located at the target cell. This indication should be used to perform the user
plane switch.
11) The release of resources on the source side is triggered directly by the
target side.
NOTE: t is ffs whether the release of the resources on the source side is done
with MME/UPE involvement or by the \"target LTE-RAN functions\" directly.
12) If the new cell is member of a new Tracking Area, the UE needs to register
with the MME/UPE which in turn updates the area restriction information on the
target side.

## 7.19 Key Issue -- Service continuity at domain and RAT change for TS 11, TS
12, ... and equivalent PS service
The intent of this clause is to study solutions for service continuity at
domain and RAT change for TS 11, TS 12, ... and equivalent PS service (see
3GPP TS 22.278 [34] for detailed requirements). The initial focus is put on
voice call continuity, however the study on continuity of other services (e.g.
video) shall not be precluded.
### 7.19.1 Voice call continuity between IMS over SAE/LTE access and CS domain
#### 7.19.1.1 Description of key issue Voice call continuity between IMS over
SAE/LTE access and CS domain
The intent of this clause is to study alternative solutions for Voice call
continuity between IMS over SAE/LTE access and CS domain. The solutions
studied here shall allow coexistence with VCC (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.206
[29]). Solutions compatible with VCC Rel 7 shall be studied.
It is expected that some of the alternative solutions may be applied in pre-
SAE/LTE context i.e. for Voice call continuity between IMS over 2G/3G PS
access and CS domain. Any such applicability to pre-SAE/LTE context should be
highlighted when incorporated in here.
In the following desirable characteristics for proposed solutions are listed:
\- The solution shall not require UE and/or RAT capability to simultaneously
signal on two different RATs.
\- Impact on service quality, e.g. QoS, interruption times should be minimized
\- RAT/domain selection/change should be under network control.
\- RAT/domain selection/change may be restricted to some access systems and
some subscribers, depending on operators\' policies.
\- It shall be possible for operators to restrict and disable the handover of
voice calls across different access domains even if voice call services are
available separately from those domains.
Editor\'s Note: the triggering for domain change, either UE initiated or
network initiated, is FFS.
\- In roaming cases, the Visited PLMN should control the RAT/domain
selection/change while taking into account any related HPLMN policies
\- Inter-domain handover in the VPLMN should be performed without significant
amount of signalling to the HPLMN.
\- Impact on legacy RAT is highly undesirable
\- Impact on legacy CS CN is undesirable
#### 7.19.1.2 General aspects
It is understood that the service continuity aspects described in this clause
are linked to radio aspects peculiar to single radio devices e.g. handovers
across 3GPP radio technologies.
Different solutions may be suited depending on the scenarios (e.g. which
combination of domain transfer and radio handover), on the deployment
assumptions (e.g. PS Handover and VoIP optimisations supported in the 2G
domain or not) and on the intended use cases (e.g. LTE used as an overlay in
areas where both 2G and 3G are present, or as a replacement for either of
them)
The following table summarises the number of scenarios potentially to be
considered for the continuity between IMS and CS

#### 7.19.1.3 Alternative solution A -- Combinational VCC
##### 7.19.1.3.1 Description
Combinational VCC (C-VCC) is a combination of radio handover (HO) and VCC
domain transfer (DT; as defined in 3GPP TS 23.206 [29]).
The continuity between IMS/LTE and 3G CS is enabled by going through 3G PS as
an intermediate step i.e.
**\- LTE** =(PS HO)=> _via_ _3G PS_**=(DT)= > **3G CS**, and
**\- 3G CS** =(DT)=> _via_ _3G PS_**=(PS HO)= > **LTE**.
A pre-requisite for C-VCC operation in this scenario is that the 3G cell
supports both CS voice bearers and PS voice bearers.
The continuity between IMS/LTE and 2G CS is enabled by going through 2G PS as
an intermediate step i.e.
**\- LTE** =(PS HO)=> _via_ _2G PS_**=(DT)= > **2G CS**, and
**\- 2G CS** =(DT)=> _via_ _2G PS_**=(PS HO)= > **LTE**.
A pre-requisite for C-VCC operation in this scenario is that the 2G cell
supports both CS voice bearers and PS voice bearers. In addition, the terminal
and the 2G RAN must support the PS handover procedure and the DTM capability.
The GPRS access of the 2G cell is used like a "changing room" where the voice
call/session can quickly change its nature (from CS to IMS or vice versa), but
without keeping the VoIP session in GPRS longer than necessary to perform this
transformation.
The solution is applicable in pre-SAE/LTE context, including transitions
to/from 3G PS-only cells. It requires support for PS Handover and DTM on the
2G side.
##### 7.19.1.3.2 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture
##### 7.19.1.3.3 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture
##### 7.19.1.3.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
#### 7.19.1.4 Alternative solution B
##### 7.19.1.4.1 Description
This solution enables the continuity between IMS/LTE and 3G CS by going
through 3G PS as an intermediate step (i.e. the same as in clause 7.19.1.3).
There is no provision for support of continuity between IMS/LTE and 2G CS
directly without going through 3G as an intermediate step. This would be
achieved as follows:
**\- LTE** =(PS HO)=> _via_ _3G PS_**=(DT)= > _via **3G CS_** =(CS HO)=> **2G
CS** , and
**\- 2G CS** =(CS HO)=> _via_ _3G CS_**=(DT)= > _via **3G PS_** =(PS HO)=>
**LTE**.
Such a simplification is based on the assumption that LTE will be deployed in
islands of high user density first and 3G coverage in these areas is well
developed and in any case 3G with VoIP capability exists as a backup for LTE.
It is assumed that wherever there is 3G coverage, GSM coverage is also
available.
The following picture illustrates graphically the concept.
Figure 7.19.1.4.1-1: Underlying assumptions for Alternative solution B
In regions of the network where 3G VoIP coverage can be patchy and backed up
by GSM, then the network must force the voice call to be supported using 3G
CS. Methods to command the UE to perform VCC domain transfer could be various.
For instance, the 3G NodeBs in areas of patchy 3G coverage may be configured
to transmit on the broadcast channel information that triggers the UE to move
voice calls from 3G PS to 3G CS. Also, in areas of non-patchy 3G coverage, the
3G network could transmit information on the broadcast channel that permits
the UE to stay on 3G PS for voice calls support.
When a user starts a call on 2G CS or 3G CS, or the call is handled by CS
domain at some point, the transition to 3G VoIP and then LTE should be driven
by policy. The UE could decide the transition to 3G PS when the network
provides positive information that VoIP is supported on 3G PS. The transition
to LTE would then be governed by network controlled HO policies between 3G PS
and LTE.
The solution is applicable in pre-SAE/LTE context provided that the 3G cells
in the border areas support access to both CS and PS domain.

##### 7.19.1.4.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
#### 7.19.1.5 Alternative solution C -- CreDT
##### 7.19.1.5.1 Description
Call Re-establishment on Domain Transfer (CreDT) is a \"break-before-make\"
solution in which the remote party is \"parked\" while the UE is in the source
radio, and is then \"un-parked\" once the UE moves to the target radio. The
VCC application on the network side anchors the bearer path of the remote
party during the execution of CreDT. The user is notified via appropriate MMI
of the ongoing CreDT procedure, whereas comfort tone or recorded announcement
is provided to the remote party during CreDT.
The CreDT procedure initiation can be signalled explicitly by the UE (refer to
Annex E in 3GPP TR 23.806 [30] for detailed call flows) or implicitly deduced
by the VCC application upon radio link failure (the latter is referred to here
as \"Implicit CreDT\").
The solution is applicable in pre-SAE/LTE context, including transitions
to/from 3G PS-only cells. It does not require support of PS Handover or DTM on
the 2G side.

##### 7.19.1.5.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
#### 7.19.1.6 Alternative solution D - « Inter-MSC Handover » solution
##### 7.19.1.6.1 Description
This alternative solution is based on the inter-MSC Handover procedure. The
SAE/LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) emulates an \"anchor MSC\" functionality and
exhibits the "E" interface towards the neighbouring MSCs. The solution works
for voice calls which have been initiated in IMS/LTE and allows for subsequent
transitions from 2G CS domain back to IMS/LTE.
While in IMS/LTE mode, the CSCFs detect the potential candidate sessions for
VCC transition to the CS domain and propagate this information via the PCRF
and the EPC to the evolved RAN. This information allows the evolved RAN to
identify the Ues for which to initiate measurements that may eventually
trigger the inter-MSC HO procedure. At the end of the inter-MSC procedure, the
P-CSCF may have to register with the IMS on UE\'s behalf in case the UE has no
DTM capability. It is FFS how call control signalling is handled after
handover (e.g. relay of call control signalling in BSSMAP messages).
Similar logic may be used for subsequent transitions from 2G CS to IMS/LTE,
but it requires further investigation.
The services remain anchored in the IMS after the initial and subsequent
transitions to/from the CS domain.
This solution may also be applicable for continuity between 3G PS and 2G CS,
but it requires further investigation.

#### 7.19.1.6a Alternative D-1 -- Inter-MSC Handover with anchoring at the VCC
Application
##### 7.19.1.6a.1 Description
This alternative proposes a solution utilizing the inter-MSC handover
mechanism and the VCC Rel-7 Voice Call Continuity Application to enable the
handover call between CS domain and LTE/SAE access. Re-use and enhancement of
Release 7 VCC, where applicable, will be considered. To realize this solution,
the following principles apply:
1\. All services are centralised in IMS
2\. Session is anchored in the VCC Application
3\. SIP session runs in the UE when using LTE access
4\. When using PS access, SIP session runs in the UE with CS Proxy presenting
it to IMS
##### 7.19.1.6a.2 LTE => 2G CS voice continuity with CS Proxy reference
architecture
**The following figure shows the concept of CS proxy to be use for LTE to 2G
CS voice call handover.**
Figure 7.19.1.6a-1: LTE to 2G CS HO with CS Proxy
Figure 7.19.1.6a-2:LTE => 2G CS voice continuity call flow
1\. There is an ongoing IMS Voice session establish in the IMS where the
session is anchored in the VCC Application. In step 1a, the target measurement
report is sent to Source eNB. The VCC Application is informed by the S-CSCF
about the used CK/IK (cipher and integrity key) in the 3^rd^ party register.
Note, for handovers to 2G RAN, the AKA keys shall be converted to SIM
compatible keys according to the procedures specified in TS 33.102 [xx].
2\. Source eNB processes the measurement report and determines a handover is
needed. In step 2a the Source eNB sends the Handover Required Message to MME
containing the required information such as source to target information.
3\. The MME determines the target MSC based on the information received in the
Handover Required message. (How the MME learns the CS Proxy information that
will be needed in the handover, e.g. CS Proxy DN, CS Proxy IP address, is not
specified here. The information could be provisioned or the MME could use some
CS Proxy local discovery mechanism).
4\. The MME sends the Handover Request message to the UE with information such
as source to target information, the target MSC, and the CS Proxy Information.
5\. The UE generates and sends SIP REFER message with target information to
VCC Application. The SIP REFER is sent within the currently active voice call
dialogue.
6\. The VCC Application returns SIP 202 Accept and begins the domain transfer
to the CS domain.
7\. The VCC Application initiates MAP Prepared Handover Message to the CS
Proxy. In step 7b the CS Proxy forwards the MAP Prepared Handover Message to
the target MSC.
8\. Standard GSM Handover Request and Acknowledge messages flow between target
MSC and target BSS
9\. Target MSC returns Handover Number in the Prepare Handover Response
message to allow establishment of a circuit connection between the target MSC
and MGW. In step 9b, the CS Proxy forwards the MAP Prepare Handover Response
message to the VCC Application.
10\. Step 10 -- Step 20 is the establishment of the circuit connection from
the UE through the MSC to the MGW Upon receiving message in step 13, the UE
plays a tone to the subscriber to give an indication of radio technology
change.
11\. Upon completion of establishing circuit connection, the LTE resource is
released.
12\. VCC Application sends re-INVITE to MGCF to switch the media path from the
UE to the target MSC.

Editor\'s Note: Optimization of number of message is FFS.
##### 7.19.1.6a.2a Optimized LTE => 2G CS voice continuity call flow
Figure 7.19.1.6a-2a below presents an optimized signalling flow for LTE to 2G
CS domain call transfer, which exhibits several optimizations as compared to
the signalling flow in the previous sub-clause. For example, in the optimized
flows a "Handover Required" message is sent by CS Proxy to the VCC
Application, instead of sending a SIP REFER from the UE to the VCC Application
to indicate that handover to CS domain is required. Also, in the optimized
flows, the UE receives the "Handover Command" within an Access Stratum message
(see step 12c) via the eNB. So, the "Handover Command" is not encapsulated
within a SIP NOTIFY message as is done in the previous sub-clause. More
improvements are further discussed below.

Figure 7.19.1.6a-2a: LTE => 2G CS voice continuity call flow
1\. The UE is attached to the EPC and has an ongoing IMS Voice session
establish in the IMS where the session is anchored in the VCC Application. The
VCC Application is informed by the S-CSCF about the MSISDN, "tel" URI and
other PUIs in the UE's implicit registration set as a result of a 3^rd^ party
registration procedure. During the session setup the P-CSCF triggers the
dedicated bearer establishment during which policy rules are transferred from
the PCRF to the PDN GW and the source eNB. Such policy rules allow eNB to
determine if the originating session is a "candidate for VCC transfer" to the
2G CS domain. "VCC-only CS security context key(s)" are generated in both the
UE and MME from the existing PS domain security context key(s).
2\. When the eNB receives the "candidate for VCC" indication from the policy
rules, the eNB can include candidate 2G CS cells into the neighbour cell lists
which it sends to the UE.
3\. Based on the received measurement reports and the policy rules received in
step 1, the source eNB decides to initiate a handover to the 2G CS domain. For
this purpose it sends a "Handover Required" message to the MME. The message
informs the MME about the target 2G cell ID and indicates that this is a
handover to the 2G CS domain.
4\. The MME uses the information provided by the eNB to select the target MSC
based on configuration data stored in the MME. It also determines both the
MSISDN and home IMS VCC Application DN associated with the UE through
subscriber data it received for the UE during Network Attachment. Either
provisioning or local discovery mechanisms can be used to allow the MME to
acquire the IP address of the CS Proxy.
5\. The MME passes the information obtained in step 4 to the CS Proxy. The CS
Proxy, in turn, has the interface that is used to format and forward the
required handover information to the UE's VCC Application via a "2G CS
Handover Required" message. When the VCC Application receives the "2G CS
Handover Required" message, it takes on the role of an anchor MSC-server in
the "basic handover procedure requiring a circuit connection between MSC-A and
MSC-B" (see TS 23.009).
6\. The VCC Application uses the MSISDN to help correlate the "2G CS Handover
Required" message with the IMS Voice session it is anchoring for the UE. The
VCC Application sends a MAP Prepare Handover request message to the target CS
Proxy. In step 6b the CS Proxy forwards the MAP Prepared Handover Message to
the target MSC.
7\. Standard Handover Request and Acknowledge messages flow between target MSC
and target BSS.
8\. Target MSC returns Handover Number in the Prepare Handover Response
message to allow establishment of a circuit connection between the target MSC
and MGW. In step 8b, the CS Proxy forwards the MAP Prepare Handover Response
message to the VCC Application.
9\. The VCC Application initiates a new call (with a SIP INVITE) towards the
2G CS domain by using the Handover Number provided by the target MSC. This
call is required in order to establish a user plane between the IMS MGCF/MGW
and the UE through the 2G CS domain.
10\. The circuit connection between the target MSC and the IMS MGCF/MGW is
established with the exchange of the ISUP IAM and ACM signalling messages.
11\. The MGCF responds to the VCC Application with a SIP Progress message.
12\. A Handover Command is sent from the VCC Application to the CS Proxy which
includes the HO_CMD received in step 9. The Handover Command is forwarded to
the MME and on to the source eNodeB in step 12b. The message is sent to the UE
in step 12c instructing the UE to move from the PS domain to the 2G CS domain
by retuning to the target radio network and using the correct Cipher Key(s).
13\. The UE accesses the target cell using normal 2G access signalling. The
target BSS detects the presence of the UE and sends a HO Detect message to the
target MSC.
14\. In response to the HO Detect message, the MSC sends a MAP Process Access
Signalling request message to the CS Proxy including the HO Detect message
received from the BSS. The CS Proxy forwards this message to the VCC
Application.
15\. When the UE is successfully communicating with the target BSS a Handover
Complete message will be sent by the UE to the target BSS. The target BSS will
then send a Handover Complete message to the target MSC.
16\. In response to the HO Complete command, the MSC sends a MAP Send End
Signal request message to the CS Proxy including the HO Complete message
received from the BSS. The CS Proxy forwards this message to the VCC
Application.
17\. When the HO Detect/Complete is received, the MSC sends an ISUP Answer
message to the IMS MGCF/MGW to complete the bearer path between the MSC and
the MGW.
18\. The MGCF sends a SIP 200 OK message to the VCC Application. This
establishes a new access leg between the VCC Application and the 2G CS domain
with the appropriate user plane resources in place between the IMS MGW and the
MSC MGW.
19\. The VCC Application sends a SIP re-INVITE message to the MGCF/MGW serving
the CS/PSTN remote party. The MGCF instructs the MGW to update a termination
toward the access leg of the 2G CS domain established in step 19, and to
release the termination for the access leg of the SAE/LTE domain.
20\. The MGCF sends a SIP 200 OK message to the VCC Application signifying the
completion of the session modification procedure.
21\. The VCC Application initiates the release of the source access leg in the
SAE/LTE domain by sending a suitable message to the MME.
##### 7.19.1.6a.3 2G CS => LTE voice continuity call flow
Figure 7.19.1.6a-3: Overview CS to LTE Handover Call Flow
Figure 7.19.1.6a-3 provides an overview of the CS to LTE handover procedure.
The procedure is broken into 2 phases. The first phase is a normal handover as
seen from the perspective of the source MSC. This results in a media path that
includes an IP to MSC to IP loop that can be eliminated in the second phase.
The key for eliminating the loop is that the VCC Application has anchored the
signaling on the original call (labeled Call 1a and Call 1b in the figure) and
the handover call (labeled Call 2a and Call 2b in the figure). The VCC
Application recognizes that both calls are associated with the same UE and
that the second call is a handover call. Knowing that, the VCC Application
links the UE to the original call port directly, connecting the Call 1a leg to
the Call 2b leg and eliminating the Call 1b to Call 2a legs.
Figure 7.19.1.6a-4: Basic CS to LTE Handover Call Flow
The initial state is that the UE is in a PSTN call while in the CS domain. The
VCC Application is anchoring the call using the procedures specified in 3GPP
TS 23.206 [29].
1\. The UE performs normal GSM measurement reporting as specified in [GSM TS],
including eNB measurements.
2\. The BSS determines that a handover is required and sends a Handover
Required message to the Source MSC.
3\. Based on information in the Handover Required message, the Source MSC
determines that the CS Proxy is the target MSC and sends a MAP Prepare
Handover Required message to the CS Proxy. The CS Proxy uses the IMSI to do a
lookup in the HSS to determine which VCC Application is supporting the UE.
4\. The CS Proxy sends the Prepare Handover Required message to the VCC
Application
5\. The VCC Application creates a Handover Number (HO#) and a Reference Number
(Ref#) that will be used to direct the handover calls to the VCC Application.
In IMS terms, these are PSIs that refer to the VCC Application Server. The
Prepare Handover Response is sent from the VCC Application via the CS Proxy to
the Source MSC.
6\. Using normal GSM handover procedures, the Source MSC sends an ISUP IAM to
the HO#. The IAM is routed to an MGCF in the VCC Application domain.
7\. The MGCF creates a SIP INVITE that gets routed to the VCC Application
8\. The VCC Application sends back a SIP progress response
9\. The MGCF converts this to an ISUP ACM that gets sent to the Source MSC
10\. When the Source MSC gets the ACM, it sends a Handover Command that gets
forwarded to the UE.
11\. The UE uses this as a signal to commence handover to LTE and comes up on
the LTE network following the procedures defined in [TS23.401].
12\. After coming up on the LTE network, the UE sends a SIP INVITE to the Ref#
received in the handover command. The INVITE gets routed to the VCC
Application.
13\. The VCC Application completes the call setup in the IMS domain and sends
200 OK responses to both the UE and the MGCF to link the UE to the appropriate
port on the MGW.
14\. The MGCF sends an ISUP ANM to the Source MSC indicating call setup is
complete.
15\. The Source MSC releases the 2G radio resources, but remains in the call
path as the 2G anchor point.
EMBED PowerPoint.Slide.8
Figure 7.19.1.6a-5: Bearer and Signaling Path Optimization for CS to LTE
Handover Call Flow
Since the VCC Application anchored the original call to the UE in the CS
domain, it is now in the path for both call legs to the Source MSC. Bearer and
signaling path optimization can occur that removes the Source MSC from the
call and just leaves the VCC Application anchor function. The VCC Application
is acting as a B2B UA for the original CS domain call and again for the
handover call from the CS domain. The VCC Application now merges the two B2B
UA appearances into 1 B2B UA and removes the Source MSC from the calls.
16\. The VCC Application sends a SIP re-INVITE for the initial call from the
MGCF. This time it includes the UEs SDP as the target and not a loop back port
in the MGW.
17\. The MGCF sends messages to the MGW to disconnect the path to the CIC that
went to the MSC and connect the CIC from the PSTN to the UEs SDP. When the
MGCF completes configuring the MGW, it replies with the MGW information in the
200 OK response to the VCC Application
18\. The VCC Application sends a SIP BYE to the MGCF for the call to the CS
domain.
19\. The MGCF converts this to an ISUP release that gets forwarded to the MSC.
20\. In parallel with 18, the VCC Application sends a SIP BYE to the MGCF for
the call from the Source MSC for the handover.
21\. The MGCF converts this to an ISUP release that gets forwarded to the MSC.
22\. The VCC Application sends a re-INVITE to the UE that points the UE to the
MGW port for the initial PSTN call instead of the MGW port for the handover
call, using the information received in the 200 OK from the MGCF.
Normal SIP call signaling then proceeds to transfer the call legs and the
Source MSC uses normal procedures to release all of the 2G resources. The
result is a call between the UE and the PSTN solely via IMS.
Similar logic applies if the other end of the original call was an IMS UE and
not a PSTN destination.
##### 7.19.1.6a.3a Optimized 2G CS => E-UTRAN voice continuity call flow
Figure 7.19.1.6a-5a below presents an optimized signalling flow for 2G CS
domain to E-UTRAN call transfer, which exhibits several optimizations as
compared to the signalling flow in the previous sub-clause. These
optimizations are further discussed below.
NOTE: The figure below assumes that the UE remains attached to EPC while using
the 2G CS domain and that it can re-use the IP address that was received
during EPC attachment.
Figure 7.19.1.6a-5a: 2G CS => LTE voice continuity call flow
The initial state is that the UE is in a PSTN call while in the CS domain. The
VCC Application Server is anchoring the call using the procedures specified in
TS 23.206. The 2G network has all configured neighbouring cell information
such as E-UTRAN cells, UTRAN cells and 2G BS cells.
1\. Neighbour cell measurements are performed by the UE and forwarded to the
BSS. The BSS includes candidate eNodeB cells into the neighbour cell lists
which it sends to the UE.
2\. Based on the received measurement reports and associated policy rules, the
BSS decides to initiate a handover to the E-UTRAN domain. For this purpose it
sends a "Handover Required" message to the MSC. The message informs the MSC
about the target eNodeB cell ID.
3\. The source MSC uses the information provided by the BSS along with
configuration data stored in the MSC to determine the CS proxy that should
serve as the target MSC for the MAP Prepare Handover Request message.
4a. The MSC treats the handover as an \"Inter-MSC\" procedure so it sends a
MAP Prepare Handover request message to the target CS Proxy. The MAP Prepare
Handover message shall carry the target eNodeB cell ID along with the IMSI and
MSISDN of the UE.
4b. The CS Proxy uses the IMSI to do a lookup in the HSS to determine which
VCC Application is supporting the UE. The CS Proxy is configured to allow it
to determine the target MME associated with the target eNodeB cell ID received
in the MAP Prepare Handover request message.
5\. The CS Proxy sends the MAP Prepare Handover request message to the VCC
Application. When the VCC Application receives the MAP Prepare Handover
request message, it takes on the role of a target MSC-server in the \"basic
handover procedure requiring a circuit connection between MSC-A and MSC-B\"
(see TS 23.009).
6\. The VCC Application uses the MSISDN to help correlate the MAP Prepare
Handover request message with the IMS voice session it is anchoring for the
UE. Since this is a handover to the E-UTRAN domain, the VCC Application sends
a Handover Preparation Request message to the target CS Proxy that corresponds
to the inter access system handover messaging between UTRAN/GERAN and
EPS/E-UTRAN being defined in this TR 23.882.
7\. The CS forwards the HO Request message to the target MME, which sends the
message to the target eNodeB. The eNodeB ciphering and integrity protection
keys are sent from the MME to the target eNodeB.
8\. The target eNodeB establishes bearer resources, including radio resources,
for the UE. It then returns a HO Request Ack message to the MME confirming the
handover preparation. The HO Request Ack message is then forwarded to the CS
Proxy.
9\. The CS Proxy sends a Handover Preparation Request Confirm message to the
VCC Application.
10\. The VCC sends a MAP Prepare Handover response message to the Source MSC
using the CS Proxy to forward this message.
11\. The Source MSC sends a HO Command message to the BSS which forwards it to
the UE. This command requests the UE to move from the 2G CS domain to the
E-UTRAN domain by retuning to the target radio network.
12\. The radio bearer is established between the UE and the target eNodeB.
13\. The eNodeB informs the MME about handover completion.
14\. The MME forwards the Handover Complete message to the CS Proxy, which
sends the message to the VCC Application.
15\. When Handover Complete is received, the VCC Application sends a SIP
INVITE message to the UE to begin re-establishing an access leg over the
SAE/LTE domain.
16\. The UE responds to the SIP INVITE message with a SIP 200 OK.
17\. The VCC Application returns a SIP ACK message to complete the setup of
the SIP session on the target access leg in the EPS/E-UTRAN domain.
18\. The VCC Application sends a SIP re-INVITE message to the MGCF/MGW serving
the CS/PSTN remote party. The MGCF instructs the MGW to update a termination
toward the access leg of the SAE/LTE domain established in step 17, and to
release the termination for the access leg of the 2G CS domain.
19\. The MGCF sends a SIP 200 OK message to the VCC Application. This
establishes a new access leg between the VCC Application and the SAE/LTE
domain with the appropriate user plane resources in place between the IMS MGW
and the UE.
20\. The VCC Application sends a MAP Send End Signal response message to the
MSC using the CS Proxy to forward this message. This releases the MAP
resources in the MSC.
21\. When the MAP Send End Signal response is received, the MSC will send a
CLR Command message to the BSS to release the old radio resources in the BSS.
22\. The VCC Application sends a SIP BYE message to the IMS MGCF/MGW
terminating the 2G CS domain connection to the MSC.
23\. The IMS MGCF sends an ISUP Release message to release the circuit
connection to the MSC.
#### 7.19.1.6b Alternative D-2 -- LTE-VMSC Anchor Solution
##### 7.19.1.6b.1 Description of LTE to UMTS/GERAN CS handover
This alternative is based on Alternative D where the Evolved Packet Core (EPC)
emulates an \"anchor MSC\" functionality and exhibits the "E" interface
towards the neighbouring MSCs.
A new CS-Proxy entity is introduced as a VMSC interfaced to MME on one side
and to CS core on the other side. It corresponds to the MSC entity that serves
the LTE user and acts as a Anchor MSC function, forwarding the handover
required by the LTE towards the CS target network. This new CS-Proxy entity
has some specific behaviour compared to a legacy MSC in order that existing
MSC's do not need to be modified.
In the same way as in UMTS, the UE performs and reports measurements of
neighbour cells to the eNB , which is able to decide a handover to a CS target
cell. When the HO decision is taken, the eNB sends a Handover Request towards
the CS-Proxy, which initiates a standard inter-MSC Hand-Over procedure.
It also requests the UE to initiate a VCC Domain Transfer to CS by initiating
a Setup towards the VDN (VCC Domain Transfer Number) the UE knows, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.206. The Setup message (new message) is tunnelled
through the LTE network to the CS-Proxy. Unlike alternative F, the SIP session
is not relocated from the UE to the network.
The CS-Proxy waits for completion of the handover preparation phase, i.e.
network resources reserved towards the target network, and for the Setup (VDN)
message sent by the UE. The CS-Proxy (acting as a VMSC and a MGCF) routes the
call signalling towards the user\'s VCC AS in the home network.
Upon receiving Re-Invite message, the UE-B replies with 200 OK, disconnects
its user plane from the previous path and connects it to the new path to the
MGW associated with the CS-Proxy.
As the path with UE-B is established, the CS-Proxy can now request the UE-A to
perform Handover Execution phase i.e. to switch its radio to the target cell.
CS-Proxy connects UE-B path to MSC-B.
The target NodeB/BTS detects the UE-A and sends Handover Detect to the RNC
that will relay it to MSC-B. MSC-B connects the UE-A path to the UE-B path. At
this point, user plane is end-to-end connected. The UE-A sends Handover
Complete message to the RNC/BSC that relays it to the MSC-B. MSC-B relays it
to the CS-Proxy in order to release serving network resources in SAE network
and eNB.
A possible alternative, called "VDN-plus", to avoid forcing the UE to
participate in the Domain Transfer, is to have the VDN in the HSS subscriber
profile. The VDN is provided at Attach to the MME, which passes it to the CS-
Proxy at first relocation message. Alternatively, VDN may be communicated to
the MME via the PCRF, PGW and SGW, or VDN may be derived from the MSISDN by
the CS-Proxy or retrieved via CAMEL.
MME and CS-Proxy are functions located in the VPLMN and can be collocated. In
a roaming scenario, the user plane path is optimized i.e. it does not need to
go through the HPLMN.
##### 7.19.1.6b.2 Information flows
Handover from LTE to UMTS/GERAN CS is depicted in the following flow charts.
The flow charts represent UMTS entities and messages, but it also applies to
GERAN entities and messages.
{width="6.526388888888889in" height="4.5784722222222225in"}

{width="6.526388888888889in" height="4.063194444444444in"}
Figure 7.19.1.6b-2: Handover from LTE to UMTS/GERAN CS (2nd part)
1\. UE-A performs measurements and sends measurement reports to the eNB.
2\. eNB determines that a handover to UMTS or GERAN CS domain should be
performed. It sends a Relocation/Handover Required message to the MME
indicating the target cell and that it is a handover to CS domain.
3\. The MME selects a CS-Proxy in the same PLMN and forwards the
Relocation/Handover Required to that CS-Proxy node. In the \"VDN-plus\"
alternative, the MME gets the VDN from the HSS and forwards this information
to the CS-Proxy in the Relocation/Handover Required message.
4\. As the CS-Proxy node is in the same PLMN, it is configured with necessary
tables enabling to determine MSC-B and forward the handover request via MAP
Prepare HO Request to MSC-B.
5\. MSC-B sends Relocation/Handover Request to the target RNC.
6\. The target UTRAN reserves the RAN resources and replies with
Relocation/Handover Request Ack to MSC-B.
7\. MSC-B sends MAP Prepare HO Response back to CS-Proxy. Necessary CS domain
resources are then established between CS-Proxy and MSC-B.
8\. CS-Proxy establishes the path between MGW and MSC-B using ISUP IAM and
ACM. In the \"VDN-plus\" alternative, the steps a) to c) do not exist.
a. In parallel with steps 2 to 8, as soon as the eNB determined that a
handover to UMTS or GERAN CS domain should be performed, it sends a new \"CS
Handover Request\" to the UE-A requesting the UE-A to initiate a domain
transfer.
b. UE-A sends the Setup (VDN) message to MME.
c. MME relays the Setup (VDN) message to CS-Proxy.
d. The CS-Proxy reserves resources at its MGW.
e. When CS-Proxy has received both Setup (VDN) from UE-A and MAP Prepare HO
Response (or alternative \"VDN-plus\", only MAP Prepare HO Response), the
Domain Transfer is processed as described in clause 6.4.2.1 of TS 23.206
\"Domain Transfer: IMS to CS\". The DTF (PSI) DN is resolved using the VDN at
the CS-Proxy. The CS-Proxy routes the call by sending an INVITE (PSI) towards
the user\'s VCC via the CSCF.
f. The UE-A CSCF forwards the requests to the VCC AS.
g. The VCC AS sends a RE-INVITE towards UE-B through its CSCF, that includes
the user plane MGW address.
h. UE-B replies with a 200 OK towards the CSCF, and connects its user plane to
the indicated MGW user plane address.
i. The VCC AS forwards the reply to the CS-Proxy.
9\. The CS-Proxy requests the MGW to connect the user plane.
10\. As the path with UE-B is established up to the MSC-B, the CS-Proxy can
start the handover execution phase by sending Relocation/Handover Command to
the MME.
11\. MME sends Relocation/Handover Command to eNB.
12\. eNB sends Handover Command to UE-A.
13\. UE-A already knows that the handover is directed to CS domain via the
message CS HO Request send in step a), therefore it knows it has to switch
from VoIMS to VoCS. UE-A switches its radio to UMTS/GERAN target cell. It may
be detected by the NodeB/BTS. The NodeB/BTS sends Handover Detect to the
RNC/BSC. The RNC/BSC relays Handover Detect to MSC-B. MSC-B connects the UE-A
path to the UE-B path. At this point, user plane is end-to-end connected.
14\. UE-A sends Handover Complete message to the RNC/BSC that relays it to the
MSC-B.
15\. MSC-B indicates Handover Detect via MAP PROC ACCESS SIG REQ (HO Detect)
to CS-Proxy in order to release serving network resources in SAE network and
eNB. CS-Proxy releases all resources in eNB via MME.
16\. MSC-B indicates the Handover Complete via MAP SEND END SIG REQ (HO
Complete) to CS-Proxy in order to release serving network resources in SAE
network and eNB. CS-Proxy releases all resources in eNB via MME.
The following figure depicts the \"VDN-plus\" approach.
0\. A VoIP Call is established using LTE and IMS; in IMS the call is anchored
at the VCC-AS. At this point
a. The MME is aware of the VoIP bearer, such it can apply SR-VCC handling
later at HO time.
b. Possibly, the VDN is communicated to the MME via the PCRF, PGW and SGW.
Alternatively, the VDN can be derived from the MSISDN by the CS-PROXY or
retrieved via CAMEL, or downloaded from the HSS during the Attach procedure.
1\. The UE reports measurements to the eNB.
2\. The eNB recognizes the need for a handover like for any other intra 3GPP
handover. It reports the need for handover to the MME, together with the
information about the target RAN.
3\. The MME communicates the need for handover to the CS-Proxy.
4\. The CS-PROXY sends a Handover Preparation request to an MSC that serves
the target RAN to setup the CS radio bearers and CS call resources. This
message contains information about the target RAN, IMSI, CS security context
key as derived from PS domain security context key. This is existing inter MSC
handover functionality. The MSC allocates the requested resources and confirms
with a Handover Preparation Ack message to the CS-PROXY.
5\. The CS-PROXY, upon response of the handover request, establishes a CS call
to the VDN (including bearer reservation at CS-MGW).
NOTE: No CS registration is needed because MME/CS-PROXY is a trusted entity.
6\. The call to the VDN is established via the MGCF to the VCC-AS in the IMS.
The existing Rel-7 VCC mechanisms are applied, i.e. a re-INVITE is sent
towards the B-party.
7\. The MGCF confirms the CS call setup to the CS-PROXY.
8\. The CS-PROXY confirms the handover preparation to the MME by sending a
Handover Request Ack message. The message includes a CS bearer description
like used for CS handovers.
9\. The information received with the Handover Request Ack is passed
transparently from the MME to the eNB like for any other intra 3GPP handover.
10\. The eNB sends a handover command to the UE including the CS bearer
description.
11\. The UE recognises the CS bearer description and switches from LTE radio
to 2G/3G radio. It sends a handover access message to the SRVCC enabled MSC.
It switches voice media from the IP bearer to the established CS bearer.
12\. Handover Complete signalling between MME and CS-PROXY releases resources
in MME.
NOTE: No CS registration needed during call, only after the call.
##### 7.19.1.6b.3 Subsequent handovers from 2G/3G back to IMS/LTE
Handover from UMTS/GERAN CS to LTE is depicted in the following flow charts.
The flow charts represent UMTS entities and messages, but it also applies to
GERAN entities and messages.
{width="6.5256944444444445in" height="3.879861111111111in"}
Figure 7.19.1.6b-3: Subsequent handovers from 2G/3G back to IMS/LTE
1\. UE-A performs measurements and sends measurement reports to the NodeB.
2\. NodeB and RNC determine that a handover to IMS/LTE should be performed. It
sends a Relocation/Handover Required message to the MSC-B indicating the
target cell.
3\. As it is a inter-MSC handover, MSC-B sends MAP-Prep-Sub-Handover Request
back to the anchor MSC per TS 23.009. There is no need for circuit connection.
4\. CS-Proxy selects an MME that serves the eNB and sends Forward Prepare
Relocation Request to that MME.
5\. MME sends S1_Relocation_Request to the eNB.
6\. eNB reserve appropriate resources and replies MME with
S1_Relocation_Request_Ack.
7\. MME sends Forward Prepare Relocation Response to CS-Proxy.
8\. CS-Proxy sends MAP-Prep-Sub-Handover Response to MSC-B.
9\. MSC-B sends RANAP Relocation Command to the source RNC.
10\. The source RNC sends RRC Relocation Command to the UE.
11\. The UE switches its radio to the E-UTRAN cell. Radio synchronization is
detected by the eNB that sends Relocation Detect to the MME, which forwards it
to the CS-Proxy.
12\. CS-Proxy sends MAP proc access sig req (HO Detect) to MSC-B. MSC-B may
connect the user plane.
13\. CS-Proxy sends MAP send end sig req (HO Complete) to MSC-B. MSC-B
connects the user plane if not done yet at previous step.
##### 7.19.1.6b.4 Advantages of the solution
There are several significant advantages to the above described solution:
\- There is no impact to the existing Core Network nodes as existing HO
procedures are used and changes in existing MSC behaviour is separated out in
a new functional entity which can be a shared resource strategically located
in the network;
\- There is no impact to the existing RAN nodes as existing HO procedures are
used (UMTS, GERAN);
\- There is no impact to IMS network;
\- There is no impact to VCC Application as standard VCC procedures are used;
\- The user plane interruption is minimized: it corresponds to the addition of
the processing and transmission of the 200 OK between UE-B and CS-Proxy via
CSCF and Relocation Command messages, estimated between 5 and 10 ms, to the
inevitable handover execution time that is defined as the interruption time on
Layer 1 and estimated between 50 and 100 ms.
\- The handover preparation phase is minimized as the steps a, b and c are in
parallel with the legacy handover preparation phase (from Relocation/Handover
Required to MAP Prepare HO Response). Moreover, the steps a) to g) are very
short compared to the legacy handover preparation phase; this means the
handover preparation phase is similar to the R99 legacy one;
\- The CS-Proxy and the related MGW can be distributed, so it is a scalable
solution;
\- The CS-Proxy being in the VPLMN, the routing tables are the same as a
legacy MSC; Furthermore, in a roaming scenario, the user plane path is
optimized i.e. it does not need to go through the HPLMN.
\- This is a VCC procedure triggered from the network;
**Advantages of the VDN-Plus proposal**
\- Does not require pre-established CS signalling and call setup like in
alternative alt E and D2.
\- HO preparation is done in the network prior to HO command is sent to the UE
(e.g., like how it is done today in 3GPP network).
\- Short handover preparation time as the UE is not involved
\- Fully re-use IMS based VCC implementation in the network.
\- No RNC emulation.
\- No CS registration is needed.
\- There are no changes for the existing inter MSC handover procedure and
therefore no MSC changes are required
\- Compatible with IMS Centralized Service
#### **7.19.1.7 Alternative E -- IMS Anchored Voice Continuity**
##### 7.19.1.7.1 Alternative E with tunnelling option
##### 7.19.1.7.1.1 Description {#description-15 .H6}
This solution aims to use IMS and VCC Rel-7 framework for controlling the
voice call continuity between CS domain and LTE/SAE access. Re-use and
enhancement of Release 7 VCC, where applicable, will also be considered.
In order to utilize the IMS and VCC Rel-7 architecture, the following high
level architecture introduces a gateway called \" Interworking Function
(IWF)\". The role of the IWF is:
\- To proxy S3 interface between MME and SGSN,
\- To be a signalling tunnelling end point towards the LTE/SAE MME for
receiving/sending encapsulated GSM/UMTS CS signalling messages to/from the UE
and
\- To emulate a UTRAN RNS (Iu-CS interface) towards the 2G/3G MSC or GERAN BSS
(A interface) towards 2G-only MSC. No modifications to the existing MSCs are
required. As most A-capable MSCs are Iu-cs capable, it is FFS whether A
interface needs to be supported. Iu-cs/SIGTRAN is supported; it is FFS whether
Iu-cs/ATM transport option needs to be supported.
Figure 7.19.1.7-1: High Level SR-VCC Architecture
Per VCC Rel-7, for all VCC-capable UE\'s, the call is always anchored at the
VCC AS / DTF.
The Role of the IWF is to enable a single radio UE to communicate in parallel
both with the source system and target system. Instead of using separate
radios as in Rel-7 VCC, the signalling communication with the target system is
carried over the source system radio access.
Voice IWF is connected to MME with the S3\' reference point. S3\' is a version
of the S3 reference point that is enhanced to convey CS signalling messages
between MME and IWF.
##### 7.19.1.7.1.2 LTE VoIP to 2G/3G CS voice continuity {#lte-voip-
to-2g3g-cs-voice-continuity .H6}
##### 7.19.1.7.1.2.1 Overview {#overview .H6}
A SR-VCC signalling flow is presented with its two phases: \"SR-VCC pre-
registration phase\" and \"SR-VCC domain transfer phase\". These flows
represent the \"basic\" alternative E in which there should be no need for any
Rel-8 specific user plane handling (such as MRF or CS bearers over EPS) to
meet the SR-VCC break duration requirements.
NOTE: If it is later desired that some Rel-8 specific user plane handling is
to be performed, the presented basic Alt-E signalling flow can be easily
optimized for such scenarios.
##### 7.19.1.7.1.2.2 SR-VCC pre-registration phase {#sr-vcc-pre-registration-
phase .H6}
The SR-VCC pre-registration phase corresponds to the LA Update procedure
between the UE and the target MSC tunnelled through MME and IWF. At handover
decision, the initiation of the CM Service Request by the UE is triggered by a
message from E-UTRAN.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="1.9548611111111112in"}
Figure 7.19.1.7-3: SR-VCC Location Update Phase
SR-VCC pre-registration phase is started by the SRVCC UE, when two criteria
are met:
\- UE is within LTE SR-VCCan area subject to SR-VCC (as indicated to UE by
E-UTRAN. This is FFS)
\- UE is engaged in IMS VoIP session
When these criteria are met, SR-VCC UE performs a Location Update with the CS
domain (as specified in TS 24.008).
If during the VoIP session, the UE enters a LTE cell for which there is no
neighbour cells with the registered LA, the UE shall perform a Location Update
with the new LA. Periodic LA Update as per 24.008 are handled by the UE as per
24.008. It is expected that the change of LA and the LA Periodic timer expiry
during a VoIP session are not frequent.
##### 7.19.1.7.1.2.3 SR-VCC domain transfer phase {#sr-vcc-domain-transfer-
phase .H6}
This phase describes the actual SR-VCC Domain Transfer taking place if an
inter RAT handover towards 2G/3G occurs during ongoing IMS VoIP session and
when a SR-VCC is already prepared for the UE.

Figure 7.19.1.7-4. SR-VCC Domain Transfer Phase.
1\. Based on general inter system handover criteria, eNodeB decides when to
trigger an Inter RAT HO preparation towards a 2G/3G system.
1a. The eNodeB sends a RRC \"HO to CS Request\" message to the UE.
1b. UE sends CM_Service Request to CS domain. MSC triggers Security Mode
Command to IWF. IWF executes the Security mode command towards the UE. The MSC
may be configured on a per Iu-cs basis to inhibit UE authentication when the
CKSN/KSI sent by the UE is correct.
1c. After receiving a local indication of the Security Context being in place,
the SR-VCC UE shall send a CS Call Setup (VDN) towards the CS domain.
The 24.008 signalling over EPS system in encapsulated in special NAS message
\"SRVCC NAS / RRC&S1 container\". In addition of the encapsulated CS message
the UE originated SRVCC NAS / RRC&S1 containers should include a flag
describing the content of the encapsulated CS message (CC_SETUP,
CC_DISCONNECT, MM_LOCUP REQUEST or OTHER SIGNALING).
MME forwards these SRVCC NAS / RRC&S1 containers to/from IWF over the S3\'
reference point.
2\. To start inter RAT handover, eNodeB sends HO REQUIRED to MME.
3\. MME generates S3 FWD RELOCATION REQUEST and sends it towards the SGSN, via
the IWF which is in MME-SGSN S3 signalling path.
4\. IWF receives the FWD RELOCATION REQUEST from MME via S3\'. IWF checks
whether a CS Call Setup is stored locally for the UE at IWF.
If no state for the UE exists within the IWF (i.e. no CS Call Setup is
available at IWF for the UE), the IWF waits for the CS Call Setup (VDN) for a
short time. If the CS Call Setup (VDN) is not received before timer expiry
then no Domain Transfer is required for this S3 inter RAT Relocation. In this
case the IWF acts as transparent S3 signalling proxy between the MME and SGSN
for subsequent Inter RAT Relocation signalling. (This case is not shown in
figure)
If a CS Call Setup is available at the IWF for the UE before the above timer
expires, the IWF forwards the locally stored CS Call Setup to the MSC in Iu-CS
Initial UE Message. IWF uses the registered Location Area Identity in the
Initial UE message.
IWF intercepts the received S3 FWD RELOCATION REQUEST message and reconstructs
the message to reflect the forking of the VoIP bearer towards the CS domain.
5\. When MSC receives CS Call Setup, MSC triggers RAB Assignment for the CS
call towards the IWF.
6\. IWF responds with RAB ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE.
NOTE: As the Iu-CS user plane is established towards the MGW by UTRAN and as
there is no coordination between the MGW and MSC at this phase, it should be
possible for the IWF to skip the Iu-CS user plane establishment towards MGW
and proceed with step 6 without setting up a Iu-CS user plane.
7\. Immediately after RAB ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE IWF proceeds with the Inter RAT
Relocation. IWF sends Iu_CS RELOCATION REQUIRED to MSC for the established CS
RABs. MSC proceeds with the relocation towards the target 2G/3G system. Note
that in case the inter RAT HO target is a 2G radio system, the MSC performs an
3G to 2G inter RAT HO for the CS call. In case when the target access system
is not controlled by the current MSC, an inter MSC handover is performed by
the MSC.\ \ IWF also forwards the reconstructed S3 FWD RELOCATION REQUEST to
SGSN, if any other PS services were active.
8\. Preferably triggered by the step 4 the MSC proceeds with the CS call as
specified for Release 7 VCC. MSC sends IAM towards the MGCF.
9.-10. MGCF invites the DTF to the CS call.
11\. DTF proceeds with the domain transfer and sets up the access leg for the
CS call. MGCF completes the access leg setup by sending ANM to MSC. During
this Domain Transfer process the original VoIP media path gets disconnected.
NOTE: At this step it could be possible to insert a MRF into the media path.
If MRF is inserted the original VoIP media path would not be disconnected.
Whether a MRF would be beneficial at all is FFS.
12\. In parallel with the Call handling at CS core, IWF receives Iu-CS
RELOCATION COMMAND from MSC when the relocation preparation at target CS
system has completed. IWF also receives S3 FWD RELOCATION RESPONSE from target
SGSN if a parallel PS relocation was triggered.
NOTE: In order to further optimize the voice call break time, the IWF may in
some deployments artificially delay the step 13 to give more time for the CS
call to proceed.
13\. After completion of the relocation preparation at target CS ( and PS)
system(s), IWF reconstructs the S3 FWD RELOCATION RESPONSE to correspond to
the originally received PS-only relocation triggered by the MME. IWF forwards
the reconstructed FWD RELOCATION RESPONSE to the MME.
14\. MME sends S1-AP HANDOVER COMMAND to eNodeB.
15\. eNodeB sends an inter RAT HO Command to UE. This inter RAT HO command
allocated the target system resources for the CS call and for the possibly
existing PS sessions. The target system radio resource information is
transparent to E-UTRAN.
16\. UE performs inter RAT HO by tuning away from LTE and by accessing the
target 2G/3G radio system. Target 2G/3G access system indicates to the MSC the
detection of the UE at target System.
17\. MSC forwards the CS Call CONNECT (as specified in TS 24.008) to UE.
To minimize the break time in the voice path:
\- the forwarding of the CS call setup by the IWF (step 4) should be triggered
by the Inter RAT Relocation procedure (step 3).
\- the step 13 may be artificially delayed by the IWF ( to allow the call
proceed further before the Inter RAT HO)
It is FFS, whether alternatively, the VCC application may be enhanced to
introduce a MGW to the media path to maintain both voice media to the VoIP leg
towards E-UTRAN and the CS leg towards MSC until the radio handover is
confirmed. During this period, the MGW may use bi-casting, conferencing or
other means to assure voice continuity.
It is FFS, if as an another alternative to remove the break time, a CS voice
path could be extended through the E-UTRAN, i.e., to actually establish a EPS
bearer to carry the CS voice between the IWF and UE, so that LTE VoIP bearer
can be switched to the CS voice bearer over EPS, in this case, there is no
voice break after VCC domain transfer procedure completed. In this case IWF
supports Rx interface towards PCRF for the CS voice bearer establishment, When
the IWF receives the CS RAB assignment request from the MSC, the IWF interacts
with PCRF to trigger a dedicated bearer establishment for the CS voice, after
that, the Iu-CS interface U-Plane connection between the MSC and IWF is
completed.
In case of MME relocation while keeping the same IWF, the old MME provides the
new MME with the address of the IWF. In case of MME relocation, it is also
possible to relocate the IWF in order to keep collocation as long as it is
connected to the same MSC.
##### 7.19.1.7.2 Alternative E without tunnelling option
##### 7.19.1.7.2.1 Description {#description-16 .H6}
This solution aims to use IMS and VCC Rel-7 framework for controlling the
voice call continuity between CS domain and LTE/SAE access. Re-use and
enhancement of Release 7 VCC, where applicable, will also be considered.
In order to utilize the IMS and VCC Rel-7 architecture, the following high
level architecture introduces a gateway called \" Interworking Function
(IWF)\". The role of the IWF is:
\- To proxy S3 interface between MME and SGSN,
\- To allow the UE to be attached to the CS domain via the Gs interface
towards the GSM/UMTS MSC and
\- To emulate a UE and a UTRAN RNS (Iu-CS interface) towards the 2G/3G MSC or
GERAN BSS (A interface) towards 2G-only MSC for call setup/release and
handover. As most A-capable MSCs are Iu-cs capable, it is FFS whether A
interface needs to be supported. Iu-cs/SIGTRAN is supported; it is FFS whether
Iu-cs/ATM transport option needs to be supported.\ Some modifications to the
existing MSCs are required but without impacting the interfaces -see below.
Figure 7.19.1.7-5: High Level SR-VCC Architecture
Per VCC Rel-7, for all VCC-capable UE\'s, the call is always anchored at the
VCC AS / DTF.
The Role of the IWF is to enable a single radio UE to communicate in parallel
both with the source system and target system. Instead of using separate
radios as in Rel-7 VCC, the signalling communication with the target system is
carried over the source system radio access.
Voice IWF is connected to MME with the S3\' reference point. S3\' is a version
of the S3 reference point that is enhanced to convey CS signalling messages
between MME and IWF.
##### 7.19.1.7.2.2 LTE VoIP to 2G/3G CS voice continuity
##### 7.19.1.7.2.2.1 Overview {#overview-1 .H6}
A SR-VCC signalling flow is presented with its two phases: \"SR-VCC pre-
registration phase\" and \"SR-VCC domain transfer phase. This flow represents
the \"basic\" alternative E in which there should be no need for any Rel-8
specific user plane handling (such as MRF or CS bearers over EPS) to meet the
SR-VCC break duration requirements.
NOTE: If it is later desired that some Rel-8 specific user plane handling is
to be performed, the presented basic Alt-E signalling flow can be easily
optimized for such scenarios.
##### 7.19.1.7.2.2.2 SR-VCC preparation phase {#sr-vcc-preparation-phase .H6}
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="1.9527777777777777in"}
Figure 7.19.1.7-6: SR-VCC Location Update Phase
SR-VCC pre-registration phase is performed when the UE attaches to EPS and
each time it changes TA. This allows the IWF to select an appropriate MSC and
therefore to minimize the inter-MSC handover cases. Enhancements are FFS. The
IWF is provisioned with a pre-configured LA.
The IWF initiates a Gs Location Update procedure with the pre-configured LA
towards the MSC as specified in TS 29.108.
##### 7.19.1.7.2.2.3 SR-VCC domain transfer phase {#sr-vcc-domain-transfer-
phase-1 .H6}
This phase describes the actual SR-VCC Domain Transfer taking place if an
inter RAT handover towards 2G/3G occurs during ongoing IMS VoIP session and
when a SR-VCC is already prepared for the UE.
{width="6.69375in" height="4.936111111111111in"}
Figure 7.19.1.7-7: SR-VCC Domain Transfer Phase.
1\. Based on general inter system handover criteria, eNodeB decides when to
trigger an Inter RAT HO preparation towards a 2G/3G system.
2\. To start inter RAT handover, eNodeB sends HO REQUIRED to MME/IWF.
3\. MME initiates CM Service Request to the MSC. VLR-TMSI is used if known.
Otherwise, IMSI is used. Location Area is preconfigured to the MME/IWF with
one LA per MSC.
The MSC is configured on a per Iu-cs basis to inhibit common 24.008 procedures
(Authentication, Security, TMSI reallocation, IMEI request), useless RANAP
procedures (Location report, Common ID, Trace) and optionally global RANAP
procedures (Reset, Reset Resource, Overload, Error Indication).
> In order to handle security, there are two possibilities:
\- Sec-1 [additional Iu parameter]: CM Service Request message is enhanced
with Ciphering Info (CK, IK), which is further included in the Relocation
Request towards target RAN in step 9 (shown in figure 7.19.7-7).
\- Sec-2 [additional parameter in S3 and RRC]: (not shown in figure 7.19.7-7)
no changes to Iu but after CM Service Request (no KSI), the MSC/VLR retrieves
the authentication vectors from the HLR as for a normal call and sends
Authentication Request (RAND) to the IWF. The IWF stores RAND and the MSC
always considers the IWF has responded correctly to the Authentication
Request. RAND is sent to the UE via HO Command messages (RAND parameter to be
added to S3 and RRC).
4a-b. The MSC may request IMSI from MME/IWF if VLR-TMSI is unknown.
5\. VMSC indicates to MME/IWF that call is in progress by sending Call
Proceeding
6\. MME/IWF sends setup (VDN) to MSC. The VDN is known by MME.
7a. When MSC receives Setup (VDN), MSC triggers RAB Assignment for the CS call
towards the MME/IWF.
7b. MME/IWF responds with RAB ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE.
_NOTE: As the Iu-CS user plane is established towards the MGW by UTRAN and as
there is no coordination between the MGW and MSC at this phase, it should be
possible for the MME/IWF to skip the Iu-CS user plane establishment towards
MGW and proceed with step 6 without setting up a Iu-CS user plane._
8\. Immediately after RAB ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE MME/IWF proceeds with the Inter
RAT Relocation. MME/IWF sends Iu_CS RELOCATION REQUIRED to MSC for the
established CS RABs. MSC proceeds with the relocation towards the target 2G/3G
system. Note that in case the inter RAT HO target is a 2G radio system, the
MSC performs an 3G to 2G inter RAT HO for the CS call. In case when the target
access system is not controlled by the current MSC, an inter MSC handover is
performed by the MSC.\ \ MME/IWF also forwards the reconstructed S3 FWD
RELOCATION REQUEST to SGSN, if any other PS services were active.
9\. MSC sends Relocation Request to the target RAN.
10\. Target RAN responds MSC with Relocation Request Ack after having reserved
the RAN resources.
11\. MME/IWF receives Iu-CS RELOCATION COMMAND from the MSC when the
relocation preparation at target CS system is completed. MME/IWF also receives
S3 FWD RELOCATION RESPONSE from target SGSN if a parallel PS relocation was
triggered.
12\. Preferably triggered by the step 4 the MSC proceeds with the CS call as
specified for Release 7 VCC. MSC sends IAM towards the MGCF and MGCF invites
the DTF to the CS call.
13\. DTF proceeds with the domain transfer and sets up the access leg for the
CS call. MGCF completes the access leg setup by sending ANM to MSC. During
this Domain Transfer process the original VoIP media path gets disconnected.
_NOTE: At this step it could be possible to insert a MRF into the media path.
If MRF is inserted the original VoIP media path would not be disconnected.
Whether a MRF would be beneficial at all is FFS._
14\. The MSC sends DTAP(CONNECT) to the IWF.
15\. After completion of the relocation preparation at target CS ( and PS)
system(s), and after having received CONNECT message from the MSC, the MME/IWF
sends S1-AP HANDOVER COMMAND to eNodeB. This synchronization minimizes the
flow break duration.
16\. eNodeB sends an inter RAT HO Command to UE. This inter RAT HO command
allocated the target system resources for the CS call and for the possibly
existing PS sessions. The target system radio resource information is
transparent to E-UTRAN.
17\. UE performs inter RAT HO by tuning away from LTE and by accessing the
target 2G/3G radio system. Target 2G/3G access system indicates to the MSC the
detection of the UE at target System.
It is FFS, whether alternatively, the VCC application may be enhanced to
introduce a MGW to the media path to maintain both voice media to the VoIP leg
towards E-UTRAN and the CS leg towards MSC until the radio handover is
confirmed. During this period, the MGW may use bi-casting, conferencing or
other means to assure voice continuity.
It is FFS, if as an another alternative to remove the break time, a CS voice
path could be extended through the E-UTRAN, i.e., to actually establish a EPS
bearer to carry the CS voice between the MME/IWF and UE, so that LTE VoIP
bearer can be switched to the CS voice bearer over EPS, in this case, there is
no voice break after VCC domain transfer procedure completed. In this case
MME/IWF supports Rx interface towards PCRF for the CS voice bearer
establishment, When the MME/IWF receives the CS RAB assignment request from
the MSC, the MME/IWF interacts with PCRF to trigger a dedicated bearer
establishment for the CS voice, after that, the Iu-CS interface U-Plane
connection between the MSC and MME/IWF is completed.
In case of MME relocation while keeping the same IWF, the old MME provides the
new MME with the address of the IWF. After the relocation of MME, the IWF will
communicate with the MME via an S3 interface.
In case of MME relocation, it is also possible to relocate the IWF in order to
keep collocation as long as it is connected to the same MSC.
##### 7.19.1.7.3 2G/3G CS voice to LTE VoIP voice continuity
This procedure works for the case of "subsequent handover" i.e when the voice
call was initiated in LTE as well as for the case where the voice call was
initiated in 2G/3G.
2G/3G CS to LTE VoIP voice continuity can be achieved in many different ways
which completely reuse the Release 7 VCC framework. These mechanisms reuse the
Release 7 VCC procedures but use different mechanisms (if any) between the
underlying source (CS) and target (LTE/PS) access systems to minimize the
break time resulting from the single radio operation.
If simultaneous PS connectivity during the CS call is not possible following
steps should be followed:
\- When CS to LTE handover is desired, UE may abandon the CS system without
any preceding resource reservation at LTE system. UE abandons the source
system either by network controlled handover terminated to the IWF or by UE
controlled inter RAT Tracking Area Update (TAU) (no IWF involved)
Editor\'s note: In the case of TAU, the mechanism by which it is ensured that
the release of the CS call does not result into the release of the VCC session
is FFS.
\- UE tunes it\'s single radio to the LTE radio and re-establishes IP
connectivity via e_UTRAN.
\- UE registers to IMS (if not already registered)
\- UE Invites (SIP Invite via LTE) the VCC Application Server to the ongoing
voice call. The EPC voice bearer is setup from the network via PCRF.
These steps enable domain transfer from CS to PS in all cases but may cause a
larger break in the voice communication. Especially if the UE can be assumed
to be already IMS registered the solution should be able to meet the service
requirements defined for SR-VCC.
If simultaneous CS and PS connectivity during the CS is possible, UE may
register to IMS during the CS call via the source system.
Following signalling flow illustrates the CS->LTE SR-VCC procedure:
Figure 7.19.1.7.3-1. 2G/3G CS to LTE VoIP inter RAT Handover
In case of Network triggered inter system handover:
A1. E.g. based on the measurements and additional information, the source
system decides to initiate the handover.
A2. The source BSS/RAN sends HO Required message to MSC.
A3. The source MSC sends a HO Request message to the IWF. The IWF plays the
role of Target BSS/RAN for the MSC. This message contains the target cell.
A5. For the possibly existing PS services to be handed over to LTE, the
BSS/RAN may initiate ina parallel inter RAT PS handover / Relocation towards
the Target MME via the SGSN IWF as described for inter RAT handover in TS
23.401.\ \ In this PS handover/ Relocation the IWF is in the S3 signalling
path between the source SGSN and the target MME. As the IWF terminates the CS
relocation (from source CS system) locally, only the Handover/Relocation from
the source PS system is relayed to the target MME. IWF also coordinates --
towards the source system - the parallel execution of the CS and PS
Handover/Relocation.
A7. The IWF sends a HO Response to the MSC emulating the target BSS/RAN. This
message contains, within the transparent container, an indication to the UE
that the CS call is subject to SR-VCC and the UE should initiate SIP invite to
VCC-AS immediately after entering to the target system to resume the speech
call. LTE reserves no resources for the CS handover.
A8. The MSC sends HO Command to the source BSS/RAN.
A9. The source BSS/RAN sends a HO Command message to the UE to begin HO
procedure to the target system.
In case of UE triggered inter system handover (Tracking Area Update):
B1. UE decides to switch from CS system to LTE
Then, for both cases:
10\. UE tunes to LTE radio system and establishes RRC connection as specified
in TS 36.300.
A11. In case some LTE resources were already allocated to the UE in step A9,
the UE completes the inter RAT HO with RRC HO Complete. The eNodeB sends HO
Complete to MME.
B11. In case no LTE resources are allocated to the UE, UE triggers Tracking
Area Update (TAU) procedure towards the LTE system as specified in TS 23.401.
UE sets the Active Flag on. Default IP connectivity gets (re-)established.
12\. If UE is not already registered to IMS, UE executes IMS registration.
Existing IMS registration helps reducing the voice communication break time in
the procedure.
13\. UE sends SIP Invite to VCC-AS, inviting the VCC-AS into a VoIP call with
the UE. UE indicates the correct call to the VCC-AS by including the VDI. Upon
reception of the SIP Invite the VCC-AS invites the other end (e.g. a peer UE
or a MGW) to the new SIP call via the new VoIP leg.
14\. VSS-AS responds with 200 OK.
15\. IMS may trigger Dedicated EPS bearer establishment via PCRF for the VoIP
media. Before Dedicated bearer establishment VoIP media may use the already
established Default bearer.
16\. VCC-AS triggers resource release in the source system by sending SIP BYE
towards the source MSC/MGCF/MGW. The resources at the source system are
locally cleared.
#### 7.19.1.8 Alternative F -- Inter-MSC Handover with IMS Centralised
Services
##### 7.19.1.8.0 General Concept
This section proposes to complement Alternative D with concepts being defined
as part of IMS Centralised Services (TR 23.982). Specifically, it is proposed
to use the ICCC (IMS CS Control Channel) logical channel to convey service
control messages after HO to the CS domain.
Additionally, it defines a stand-alone interworking function referred to as
PS-CS Handover Control Function (PCHCF) which presents PS HO and CS HO
behaviour towards the SAE/LTE Evolved Packet Core and the CS core,
respectively.
There are two different solutions following with this concept, one called
alternative F-1, which is described in the section 7.19.1.8.1, and another one
is called alternative F-2, which is described in the 7.19.1.8.2.
##### 7.19.1.8.1 Alternative F-1
##### 7.19.1.8.1.1 Description {#description-17 .H6}
Depicted in Figure 7.19.1.8.1.1-1 is a SR VCC architecture, including the
architecture for handovers of non-voice sessions.
Figure 7.19.1.8.1.1-1: SR VCC architecture -- Alternative F-1
PCHCF contains MME function and anchor MSC server function. It also contains
an adaptation function for the service control signalling between CS domain
and IMS. This function converts the service control signalling information
received from the UE over CS access signalling and uses this information for
initiation and control of SIP sessions via a SIP User Agent function towards
the ICCF function in the IMS.
The PCHCF presents an Mw-like interface to the home IMS in a manner similar to
the I6 reference point between the enhanced MSC and the CSCF as defined in TR
23.892 enhanced MSC approach for non ICS UE.
NOTE: The relationship with ICS in general and the enhanced MSC approach in
particular needs to be revisited as SR VCC and ICS studies are evolving in
parallel.
The following principles are used in defining the architecture for enablement
of IMS-CS service continuity with support for IMS Centralised Services:
1\. All services are centralised in IMS;
2\. SIP session runs in the UE when using LTE access;
3\. When using CS access, SIP session runs in the UE with PCHCF presenting it
to IMS [SIP templates embedded in CS signalling for transport b/w UE and
PCHCF]; SDP is generated by PCHCF;
4\. For Handovers to CS:
a. PCHCF performs a SIP REGISTER with a new IMPI. A new SIP session is created
to initiate VCC Domain Transfer;
b. Downlink bi-cast is employed at a MRF associated with the DTF to prepare
downlink bearer toward the target GERAN/UTRAN prior to instructing the UE to
retune to the target radio. The first uplink packet from the UE after the
radio switch results in switching at the MRF of the uplink bearer from the UE;
c. In case of HO to 2G: the voice session is relocated using a new CS-PS
handover procedure which are a combination of PS-PS and Inter-MSC Handover
procedures; any non-voice sessions including the SIP signalling bearer are
suspended in the LTE access and are resumed upon subsequent handback to LTE.
In case the voice call is terminated while in 2G CS, the non-voice sessions
are resumed from the 2G access and are relocated to the 2G SGSN;
d. In case of HO to 3G: the voice session is relocated using a new CS-PS
handover procedure which are a combination of PS-PS and Inter-MSC Handover
procedures; any non-voice sessions including the SIP signalling bearer are
relocated to the 3G SGSN using the standard PS-PS HO procedure.
5\. For Handback to LTE:
a. In case of handback from 2G: the original SIP signalling bearer (as well as
any other non-voice session) is resumed; UE sends a SIP INVITE from LTE access
and NW-initiated bearer is used to establish the VoIP bearer;
b. In case of handback from 3G: the voice session is relocated using a new PS-
CS handover procedure which are a combination of Subsequent Inter-MSC Handover
and PS-PS Handover procedures; any non-voice sessions including the SIP
signalling bearer are relocated to the MME/SGW using the standard PS-PS HO
procedure.
##### 7.19.1.8.1.2 Call flows for Handovers of calls initiated in LTE {#call-
flows-for-handovers-of-calls-initiated-in-lte .H6}
##### 7.19.1.8.1.2.1 LTE => 2G CS handover {#lte-2g-cs-handover .H6}
Depicted in Figure 7.19.1.8.1.2.1-1 is a call flow for LTE => 2G CS handover
of a call initiated in LTE. It is assumed that the 2G network has no support
for DTM, 2G PS handover or VoIP optimisations.
Figure 7.19.1.8.1.2.1-2: IMS/LTE to 2G Handover (voice bearers only)
1\. Target measurements and handover trigger detection at the source eNB and
the UE for initiation of handover to CS.
2\. Relocation Required message sent by the source eNB to source MME
containing required information such as source to target information.
3\. Standard PS-PS handover procedure at the source MME for initiation of
Forward Relocation Request toward PCHCF.
4\. PS handover request interworked with CS inter-MSC handover request to the
target MSC at PCHCF. The PCHCF initiates a Prepare Handover Request toward
target MSC for the voice session only. It is assumed that the **CS Security
context (** e.g. Cipher Key, CKSN, and if handing over to UMTS CS, also the
Integrity Key**) is available at the PCHCF. Mechanisms for the
discovery/retrieval of the CS security context at the PCHCF may include the
following:**
_A) generation of extra key at PS domain authentication_
Currently, when the ME passes an Authentication Challenge into the UICC,
several security keys are generated (which match the ones contained in the
authentication vectors sent from the HSS to the MME). This could be extended
so that other keys can be generated by the UICC -- one of these could be a
"VCC-only CS domain key". The UE uses this key after handover and it would
match the one sent from the HSS to the MME (and onto the relay MSC which in
turn sends it to the GERAN) for this purpose.
This approach appears promising, but, this requires a new UICC. However the
generation of LTE keys probably also requires a new UICC -- and 'backwards
compatibility' mechanisms to use old UICCs are likely to be specified.-- see
(B) below.
_B) hash function in UE._
This is a complement to (A) above, wherein the ME uses a "hash function" on
the PS domain key(s) generated by the USIM to generate a "VCC-only CS domain
key".
The MME implements the same "hash function" on the authentication vector
received from the HSS to generate the "VCC-only CS domain key". The MME sends
this "VCC-only CS domain key" via PCHCF onto the relay MSC which in turn sends
it to the GERAN.
5\. Target GERAN preparation via the target MSC.
6\. Handover Number returned in Prepare Handover Response by the target MSC
for establishment of circuit connection between the target MSC and the MGW
associated with the PCHCF.
7\. Establishment of circuit connection between the target MSC and the MGW
associated with the PCHCF initiated by the PCHCF using ISUP IAM and ACM.
Completion of this step leads to the following subsequent steps:
a. The SIP User Agent function associated with the PCHCF performs a SIP
REGISTER with a new IMPI/IMPU pair using Early IMS procedures for trusted node
b. Subsequently PCHCF initiates an enhanced VCC Domain Transfer procedure to
perform bearer preparation. This establishes a downlink bi-cast from the MRF
associated with the DTF toward the bearer termination at the MGW associated
with the PCHCF. The first uplink packet from the MGW associated with the PCHCF
results in switch of the uplink media at the MRF.
8\. Forward Relocation Response generated toward source MME with the required
information such as target to source BSS information as indication of network
bearer preparation and to instruct the UE to retune. The Forward Relocation
Response message indicates to the MME that only the voice bearer is being

##### 7.19.1.8.1.3 Advantages of the solution {#advantages-of-the-solution
.H6}
There are several significant advantages to the above described solution:
1\. There is no impact to the existing Core Network nodes;
2\. There is no impact to the existing GERAN and UTRAN nodes as existing HO
procedures are used;
3\. There is no impact to the IMS network;
4\. The solution is compatible with IMS Centralised Services;
5\. Changes to the REL-7 VCC Application are minimised and are limited to the
use of associated MRF;
6\. The handover preparation phase should be comparable to the handover
preparation phase in 2G/3G networks;
7\. The handover interruption is expected to meet the 300 ms target in all
cases except for the 2G => LTE case due to lack of physical layer information
exchange between the source and target RANs. However, even in this case the
service interruption time is expected to be \~750 ms;
8\. The PCHCF is a control plane functionality and can be scaled separately
from the user plane functionality in the MGW;
9\. The overall SR VCC procedure is triggered from the network.
##### 7.19.1.8.2 Alternative F-2
##### 7.19.1.8.2.1 Description {#description-18 .H6}
PCHCF contains eNodeB/RNC/BSC function and anchor MSC server function.
The alternative F-2 works for the voice calls which have been initiated in the
IMS/LTE to be transferred tot he 2G/3G CS and allows for subsequent transition
from 2G/3G CS back to the IMS/LTE. It is FFS how the Alternative F-2 can be
used for calls initiated in the CS domain.
Comprising with the alternative F-1, the difference of the alternative F-2 is
that, the SAE GW acts as the media plane anchor point that all bearers of the
UE will be transferred from the eNodeB to the eNodeB/RNC/BSC associated with
the PCHCF by performing a inter eNodeB handover. So that the execution of
handover doesn't not depend on the VCC procedure, because there is no need of
sending re-invited to the remote UE to update the IP address the since the SAE
GW is still kept in the call path.
Editor's note: it is FFS how to handle the non-voice related bearer in the SAE
GW when the voice handover is occurred.
##### 7.19.1.8.2.2 SAE/LTE => CS handovers {#saelte-cs-handovers .H6}
The signalling/ bearer architecture for the LTE-2G/3G CS Handover is
illustrated in figure 7.19.1.8,2-1 below.
7.19.1.8.2-1: Signalling/Bearer Architecture for the LTE-2G/3G CS Handover
--Voice bearer anchored at SAE-GW
NOTE1: after handover, the signalling control plane between the UE and the
ICCF via SAE GW (SIP signalling bearer) will be transferred to a ICCC
signalling between the UE and the ICCF via the target MSC, how the ICCC
signalling can be routed to the ICCF located in the home IMS network will
follow the decision taken by the ICS work item.
For the sake of brevity, \"the eNodeB/BSC/RNC function associated with the
PCHCF\" is abbreviated as \"PCHCF-eNodeB/BSC/RNC\", and \"the MSC-S function
associated with the PCHCF\" is abbreviated as \"PCHCF-MSC-S\",
Based on the Figure 7.19.1.8.2-1, the more detail about the process is
depicted as follows:
1\. Based on the measurement report, the standard PS-PS Handover procedure
will be triggered and the PCHCF-eNodeB/BSC/RNC receives the standard PS-PS
Handover message (i.e. Handover Request), and the PCHCF-eNodeB/BSC/RNC
maintains the bearer information such as all PDP contexts and the related
radio parameters.
2\. The PCHCF-MSC-S mimics a standard inter-MSC Handover to establish the CS
bearer as shown in light blue real line between the UE and MSC.
3\. The data forwarding process is triggered and the source eNodeB forwards
the downlink data to the PCHCF-eNodeB/BSC/RNC.
4\. The PCHCF **decodes the downlink VoIP packets to get the voice media
information such as IP 5 tuple and the voice codec, which will be used by**
the PCHCF-MSC-S to establish the bearer as shown in light blue real line
between the MGW and the MSC using ISUP IAM/ACM.
5\. The PCHCF-eNodeB/BSC/RNC triggers the process of redirecting the bearers
from the source eNodeB to itself by sending Update Bearer Context towards SAE
GW via its serving MME. Upon completion of this process, the new voice bearer
as show in light blue real line between the UE and the MGW and in deep blue
real line between the PCHCF-eNodeB/BSC/RNC and remote UE via SAE GW has been
established or reserved successfully.
6\. When UE has accessed in the CS domain, the SIP session control messages
are transported over ICCC, which defined in the current ICS work item.
##### 7.19.1.8.2.3 Subsequent handovers from CS => SAE/LTE {#subsequent-
handovers-from-cs-saelte .H6}
The signalling/ bearer architecture for the subsequent 2G/3G CS to SAE/LTE
Handover is illustrated in figure 7.19.1.8.2-2 below.
Figure 7.19.1.8.2-2: Signalling/Bearer Architecture for the Subsequent HO
--Voice bearer anchored at SAE-GW
NOTE1: after the subsequent handover, the signalling control plane of the ICCC
signalling between the UE and the ICCF via the target MSC will be transferred
to a SIP signalling bearer between the UE and the SAE GW, how the original
ICCC signalling can be routed to the ICCF located in the home IMS network will
follow the decision taken by the ICS work item.
During the subsequent handover back from CS to LTE procedure, PCHCF only needs
to get the target LTE Cell ID from the subsequent handover message as the
related bearer information about inter-eNodeB handover has been stored and
maintained by the PCHCF-eNodeB/BSC/RNC.
When the subsequent CS to LTE handover is occurred, the related neighbour LTE
cells are configured in BSS/RNS, which, from the BSS/RNS point of view, are
regarded as pseudo-CS cells and served by the PCHCF-MSC-S. So, if the BSS/RNS
receives the measurement report sent by the UE and decides to trigger the
standard inter-MSC handover towards LTE cell, and the standard CS-CS handover
message will be sent to the target PCHCF-MSC-S with the target LTE Cell ID to
inform the PCHCF the occurrence of subsequent handover.
After that, the PCHCF-eNodeB/BSC/RNC finds out the target LTE Cell ID from the
subsequent handover message, and generates the related Relocation Required
message using the bearer information maintained in PCHCF-eNodeB/BSC/RNC, and
then mimics an inter-eNodeB handover to the real target eNodeB by sending the
Relocation Required. The following steps are similar to the standard inter-
eNodeB handover.
##### 7.19.1.8.3 Impact on the baseline CN Architecture
This solution requires new core network functionality (PCHCF). The alternative
with optimised bearer preparation requires an enhancement to REL-7 DTF
allowing for insertion of MRF in the bearer path of IMS sessions anchored at
the DTF.
##### 7.19.1.8.4 Impact on the baseline RAN Architecture
This solution does not require any of the following GERAN features: DTM, EGPRS
(EDGE), PS handover, DTM enhancements or VoIP optimisations.
##### 7.19.1.8.5 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
#### 7.19.1.9 Alternative D/F
##### 7.19.1.9.1 Description
This alternative combines the concepts and principles from Alt F1 (clause
7.19.1.8.1) and Alt D2-VDN+ (clause 7.19.1.6b) proposals as they share same
mobility trigger and functions for the \"HO\" to/from 2G/3G. The differences
are in the service capabilities (e.g., network ICS (F1) vs. non network ICS
(D2-VDN+)). This combined proposal is referred to as Alt D/F.
Depicted in Figure 7.19.1.9.1-1 is a SR VCC Alt D/F architecture, including
the architecture for handovers of non-voice sessions.
NOTE1: HO interface with MSC consists of MAP-E and speech circuit related
interface such as ISUP, BICC, or SIP-I.
NOTE2: this reference point is Mg (for support of Rel-7 VCC and Rel-8
ICS/MMSC) or Mw (for support of Rel-8 ICS/MMSC) For details of ICS, see 3GPP
TS 23.292 and for MMSC, see 3GPP TR 23.893.
NOTE3: whether SGSN is connected to the MSC/S-IWF or the MME via S3 is FFS.
This depends on the location of the PS bearer splitting functionality (voice
bearer vs non-voice bearers) as clarified further below. Once this decision is
made there will be only one S3 instance in the figure.
NOTE4: in some deployment scenarios the MSC/S-IWF may not exhibit any Iu-CS or
A interface
NOTE5: whether UE needs to be registered with MSC/S-IWF via Gs is FFS
Editor's note: IWF interworking with SMS is FFS!
Figure 7.19.1.9.1-1: SR VCC architecture -- Alternative D/F
The following principles are used in defining this Alt D/F architecture:
1\. S-IWF can perform MSC-MSC handover or RNC/BSC handover, depending on the
absence or presence of Iu-CS/A interfaces on the S-IWF.
2\. The CS access leg setup upon EUTRAN=>CS handover is triggered by the radio
handover signalling.
3\. A function that identifies the voice PS bearer upon EUTRAN=>CS handover
and separates it from the rest of PS bearers. This function is referred to as
\"PS bearer splitting function\" and is located either in the MSC/IMSC/IWF or
in the MME (FFS).
For convenience, in the remainder of this clause the MSC/S-IWF function will
be shortly referred to as S-IWF (SRVCC IWF). Note that the S-IWF may also be
implemented with an MSC Server (i.e. control plane functionality), the user
plane functionality being provided on a MGW.
##### 7.19.1.9.2 Call flows for Handovers of calls initiated in LTE
Editor\'s note: The following call flows are focusing on the voice component.
General handling of "split function" with MMSC for others PS components is
FFS.
The call flows in this clause assume that the PS bearer splitting function
(voice vs non-voice bearers) is located in the S-IWF. The case where the PS
bearer splitting function is located in the MME is covered by appropriate
indications in the text.
If the S-IWF exhibits an Iu-CS or A interface, the steps covered by yellow
boxes are not executed and the S-IWF and MSC functions are merged.
##### 7.19.1.9.2.1 LTE => 2G CS handover; {#lte-2g-cs-handover-1 .H6}
Depicted in Figure 7.19.1.9.2.1-1 is a call flow for LTE => 2G CS handover of
a call initiated in LTE. This depicts the usage of Mg interface at the IWF. It
is assumed that the 2G network has no support for DTM, 2G PS handover or VoIP
optimisations.

(voice bearers)
Before the initiation of the HO the UE may register with the CS domain via Gs
(FFS).
1\. Target measurements and handover trigger detection at the source eNB and
the UE for initiation of handover to CS.
2\. Relocation Required message sent by the source eNB to source MME
containing required information such as source to target information.
3\. Standard PS-PS handover procedure at the source MME for initiation of
Forward Relocation Request toward S-IWF.
NOTE: If the PS bearer splitting functions is located in the MME, the MME
includes only the voice bearer in the Forward Relocation Request.
4\. PS handover request interworked with CS inter-MSC handover request to the
target MSC at S-IWF. The S-IWF initiates a Prepare Handover Request toward
target MSC for the voice session only. It is assumed that the CS Security
context key can be derived from the LTE's PS domain key context (e.g. similar
for security key mapping for PS-PS HO to 2G/3G SGSN)
5\. Target GERAN preparation via the target MSC.
6\. Handover Number returned in Prepare Handover Response by the target MSC
for establishment of circuit connection between the target MSC and the MGW
associated with the S-IWF.
7\. Establishment of circuit connection between the target MSC and the MGW
associated with the S-IWF initiated by the S-IWF using ISUP IAM and ACM.
Completion of this step leads to the following subsequent steps:
7a. The S-IWF, upon response of the handover request, establishes a CS call to
the VDN (including bearer reservation at CS-MGW). VDN and MSISDN are received
from the HSS via MME as part of the subscription profile download to MME
during LTE attach procedure.
NOTE: Use of a downlink bi-cast from the MRF associated with the DTF is FFS.
8\. Forward Relocation Response generated toward source MME with the required
information such as target to source BSS information as indication of network
bearer preparation and to instruct the UE to retune. The Forward Relocation
Response message indicates to the MME that only the voice bearer is being
relocated. The MME knows that at the end of the CS-PS handover the non-voice
bearers should be preserved.
9\. Relocation Required Ack toward the source eNB to instruct the UE to retune
to the target radio.
10\. Relocation Command sent by the source eNB for the UE to retune to the
target radio.
11\. Handover Detection at the target GERAN.
12\. Handover Complete sent by the target GERAN to the MSC. Completion of this
step leads to the following subsequent steps:
a) SES Handover Complete sent to the S-IWF.
b) ISUP Answer message sent to the S-IWF to complete the bearer path between
the MSC and the MGW associated with the S-IWF.
13: S-IWF performs an MAP Update Location to the HSS/HLR if needed. This
allows S-IWF to receive GSM SS information and also allows HSS/HLR to route
the mobile terminating call properly. This step is not needed if the UE was
already registered with the S-IWF via Gs (FFS).
NOTE: This Update_location is not initiated by UE.
Depicted in Figure 7.19.1.9.2.1-2 is a call flow for LTE => 2G CS handover of
a call initiated in LTE when Mw interface is used at the IWF. It is assumed
that the 2G network has no support for DTM, 2G PS handover or VoIP

procedures. The SIP User Agent function associated with the S-IWF performs a
SIP REGISTER with a new IMPI/IMPU pair using procedures similar to Early IMS
procedures for trusted node.
7b. Subsequently S-IWF initiates an enhanced VCC Domain Transfer procedure to
perform bearer preparation.
Step 8-12. Same as in Figure 7.19.1.9.2.1-1.

the previous subclauses. The relocation of remaining PS bearers is initiated
towards the target SGSN with a Forward Relocation Request message.

##### 7.19.1.9.3 Service Model
The specific of the individual service models are provided below.
##### 7.19.1.9.3.1 IMS Centralized Services (ICS) model {#ims-centralized-
services-ics-model .H6}
The ICS can be supported with either Mw or an Mg interface from the S-IWF
towards IMS. For the support of Mw interface, the S-IWF provides functions
similar to the MSC Server enhanced for ICS defined in TS 23.292; the Mg
interface is provided by an MGCF located in the serving or home network.
##### 7.19.1.9.3.2 VCC Rel-7 model {#vcc-rel-7-model .H6}
The S-IWF utilizes the concept of R7 VCC architecture. Prior to HO procedure,
S-IWF initiates a CS call to VCC AS with VDN on behalf of the user. If UE is
not registered with S-IWF via Gs (FFS), when HO is completed, S-IWF initiates
a MAP Update Location. This allows execution of GSM Supplementary Service (SS)
by the S-IWF as it has the GSM subscriber data from the HSS, and also update
the location information in the HSS so that CS mobile terminating call routing
can be done.
##### 7.19.1.9.4 UE and S-IWF CS state synchronization
##### 7.19.1.9.4.1 UE state synchronisation {#ue-state-synchronisation .H6}
TS 24.008 (chapter 5) describes call control states for the MS (UE) and for
the Network side. During the SRVCC process, the UE receives the HO Command
with the target circuit-switched bearer radio information. The UE CS call
control state can be moved to U10 (Active state) during processing of the HO
Relocation Command message.
On the network side, the S-IWF initiated the DT with a CS call setup to VDN.
When this call is answered by the IMS/VCC-AS, the S-IWF moves the call control
states to N10 (Active state).
At this point, both the circuit-switched call control state in UE and in S-IWF
is synchronized to Active state (U10 and N10). Both S-IWF/UE continue their
call state transition from this point, as defined in TS 24.008.
##### 7.19.1.9.5 VDN allocation for S-IWF
In order to follow the R7 VCC DT procedure, the S-IWF needs MSISDN and VDN of
that user in order to generate the DT request. Both the MSISDN and VDN may be
stored in the HSS as part of the subscription profile for E-UTRAN access and
is downloaded to the MME during initial attach process as described in TS
23.401.
MME passes both MSISDN and VDN if available to S-IWF via S3'.
NOTE: The absent of VDN is used to indicate to the S-IWF that the home IMS
does not support VCC procedure for this subscriber.
##### 7.19.1.9.6 Interworking with non VCC capable IMS network
If the home IMS does not support VCC procedure, the S-IWF shall not perform DT
and shall become an S3 relay function.
S-IWF is made aware of whether home IMS support VCC for this subscriber or not
by the VDN indication from S3\'.
##### 7.19.1.9.7 Interworking with non VCC capable UE
It is proposed the SRVCC capability is indicated as part of the "UE Network
Capability". This information is sent to the MME during attach procedure. This
information is then passed to S-IWF via S3'.
S-IWF will act as S3 relay function when UE is not capable to do SRVCC.
##### 7.19.1.9.8 ICS and Distributed Service model selection
NOTE: It is TBD whether both options are needed in this architecture in R8.
This section only applies if both options are needed to be specified.
If the serving network supports both ICS and Distributed Service model, then
if the ICS subscription indication is received from the home network, then ICS
is used, otherwise, Distributed Services model is used.
##### 7.19.1.9.9 Advantages of the solution
There are several significant advantages to the above described solution:
\- There is no impact to the existing GERAN and UTRAN nodes apart from
configuration of LTE neighbouring cells;
\- There is no impact to the IMS network;
\- The solution is compatible with IMS Centralised Services and MMSC;
\- The handover preparation phase should be comparable to the handover
preparation phase in 2G/3G networks;
\- The handover interruption is expected to meet the 300 ms target in all
cases except for the 2G => LTE case due to lack of physical layer information
exchange between the source and target RANs. However, even in this case the
service interruption time is expected to be \~750 ms;
\- The overall SR VCC procedure is triggered from the network.
\- In case of LTE=>CS handover the setup of the CS access leg in the target
access is performed after the HO preparation, which allows for graceful
handling of cases where the target system has not enough resources.
#### 7.19.1.10 Partial Conclusions on Voice call continuity between IMS over
SAE/LTE access and CS domain
During the course of this study, a number of alternative architectural
solutions that enable Voice Call Continuity between IMS over SAE/LTE and CS
domain have been proposed and documented in this report. The study has
revealed the complexity of the subject and has shown that all of the solutions
have their advantages and disadvantages.
Given that:
\- most of the deployed GERAN networks do not support the following GERAN
features: DTM, PS HO or VoIP-related enhancements, and
\- GERAN WG is working on solutions for GERAN networks that support GERAN
features like: DTM, PS HO or VoIP-related enhancements,
the future SA2 work will work on solutions that do not rely on any of these as
a pre-requisite for SR VCC operation.
Alternatives that do not rely on any of the GERAN features listed above
include the following:
\- The alternatives building on the inter-MSC HO principle (D and F), and
\- Alternative E (as currently described for the IMS => CS direction only).
NOTE: Alternative C too does not rely on the GERAN features listed above,
however it is not considered a viable solution due to the significant service
break that it incurs.
NOTE: Alternative A/B may still be allowed if the target network supports DTM,
PS HO or VoIP-related enhancements.
It is noted that the Stage 1 requirement is for bi-directional voice call
continuity with interruption time not higher than 300 ms. As proposed,
Alternative E does not address bi-directionality without relying on some of
the GERAN features listed above. It is FFS if alternative E could be enhanced
with bi-directionality that does not require any of the GERAN features listed
above and if such solution would meet the Stage 1 requirements.
#### 7.19.1.11 Evaluation of the remaining options

From a high-level point of view the remaining options D/F and E can be
differentiated regarding their impacts as follows (issues were there are no
differences are omitted):
Option D / F
\- Based on MSC-MSC handover principle
\- IWF has to act as an anchor MSC server and has to provide required
interfaces and functions; in addition, IWF has SGSN functionality
\- Additional MGW and Inter-MSC Trunk resources
\- No impacts on EPC; impacts on E-UTRAN.
\- UE is not attached to CS prior handover from LTE to CS
Option E
\- Based on RNC/BSC handover principle
\- IWF has to act as RNC or BSC and has to provide required interfaces and
functions; in addition, IWF has SGSN functionality
\- Impacts on E-UTRAN and EPC for tunnelling of CS signalling. Requires
explicit or implicit indication from E-UTRAN to UE when UE enters/leaves
into/from LTE border area (\"SR-VCC Area\")
\- UE attaches to CS prior handover from LTE to CS
Both options have impacts on UE, deployment, and VCC Application; the later
only if bicasting is used.
Regarding the expected HO performance of options D/F and E, it was concluded
that there are no significant differences in performance assuming UE in Alt E
has performed the SRVCC preparation phase in advance of the actual HO
triggering by eNb. Both options provide similar level of performance in terms
of radio Handover efficiency in maintaining the service continuity and QoS
between the source and the target accesses.
Regarding commonalties and differences of the option E with Voice Service
Continuity between cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A and E-UTRA, it was concluded that
there are similar principles for triggers and encapsulation, but also
differences in the details.
Editor\'s note: A more detailed analysis regarding commonalities and
differences of the option E with Voice Service Continuity between cdma2000
1xRTT Revision A and E-UTRA is FFS.
Editor\'s note: A more detailed analysis regarding usage of ICS UE in option E
and option D/F is FSS.
#### 7.19.1.12 Conclusions on Voice call continuity between IMS over SAE/LTE
access and CS domain over GERAN/UTRAN access
It is concluded that the Stage 2 specification work should focus on the
Alternative D/F in the variant with Mg reference point described in clause
7.19.1.9 with the following clarification:
\- The \"PS bearer splitting function\" described in 7.19.1.9 is located at
the MME.
### 7.19.2 Handover of MSC controlled voice calls between SAE/LTE access and
CS access
Editor\'s Note: In order to avoid duplication of the work the \"Handover of
MSC controlled voice calls between SAE/LTE access and CS access\" will not be
developed further in this TR and will be investigated within the 3GPP TR
23.879: \"Study on CS Domain Services over evolved PS access\".
#### 7.19.2.1 Description of key issue Handover of MSC controlled voice calls
between SAE/LTE access and CS access
The intent of this clause is to study alternative solutions for Handover of
MSC controlled voice calls between SAE/LTE access and CS access. The solutions
studied here shall be compatible with CSI (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.279
[35]).
The basic assumption in this clause is that the control of voice telephony
calls is centralized in CS CN domain, for CS access as well as for LTE/SAE
access. Proposed solutions are mostly applicable for operators with a majority
of traditional CS voice service customers, and do not solve issues related to
voice telephony services offered in IMS. Non-voice telephony services are
controlled by the IMS, and are interworked with MSC controlled voice service
with CSI. The intent of such solutions is to simplify the problem of service
continuity of voice services between CS and LTE/SAE access by having the same
call control entity for all access domains, thus removing issues related to
change of call control entity when changing access domains.
In the following desirable characteristics for proposed solutions are listed:
\- The solution shall not require UE and/or RAT capability to simultaneously
signal on two different RATs.
\- Impact on service quality, e.g. QoS, interruption times should be minimized
\- RAT/access domain selection/change should be under network control.
\- In roaming cases, the Visited PLMN should control the RAT/access domain
selection/change while taking into account any related HPLMN policies
\- Inter-access domain handover in the VPLMN should be performed without
significant amount of signalling to the HPLMN.
\- Impact on legacy RAT is highly undesirable
\- Impact on legacy CS CN is undesirable
#### 7.19.2.2 Alternative solution A - « Evolved CSI » solution
##### 7.19.2.2.1 Description
The basic principle of this solution is to keep Call and SS Control for voice
telephony in the CS Domain. So, for a PS only radio access like LTE an evolved
MSC-Server, does 24.008 signalling via IP transport (tunnelled via LTE/SAE
access) towards the UE.
After the UE has established IP connectivity over LTE/SAE, the UE registers
with the eMSC similar to legacy location update procedure, and is then
\"pseudo-CS\" attached.
MO and MT call setup signalling procedure occurs according to TS 23.018, and
is transported over IP. The CS channel assignment is replaced by an SAE
network initiated bearer setup. It is assumed that SAE bearer control and PCC
mechanisms can be reused without additions.
**Mobility**
As preparation for a possibly needed PS-CS voice call continuity procedure the
eMSC registers itself at the MME as \'Handover-serving Node\' for an ongoing
voice bearer, at bearer setup.
In case a handover between LTE and legacy 3GPP radio accesses is needed the
MME triggers the respective eMSC (including the information about the target
cell ID). The eMSC then initiates standard legacy handover procedure (in case
the target cell belongs to the eMSC\'s area) or standard legacy inter-MSC
Handover procedure (in case the target cell belongs to another MSC area).
Handover is possible for PS to CS direction. Further study is needed for the
CS to PS direction (issues to resolve include PS attachment and establishment
of default IP connectivity along with the HO procedure).
**Voice & IMS-session in parallel**
Interworking of voice telephony calls with parallel IMS multimedia sessions is
done in the terminal. Interworking in the network is needed if the remote end
is doing voice over IMS (see CSI Interworking).

## 7.20 Key Issue -- SAE Identities
### 7.20.1 Description of issue
The UE and the network entities in an SAE network need different identities
for addressing, mobility, connectivity, confidentiality and other reasons.
In GSM and UMTS networks the identities are to a large extent the same. Using
the same identities specifically also for LTE accesses would be beneficial
from e.g. a UE mobility and identification point of view. In addition new
identities are needed for new network entities.
### 7.20.2 Agreements on SAE Identities
The following table defines the identities that the UE and the network need in
a SAE network.
NOTE: Identities identifying connections or tunnel end-points have not been
addressed except for some specific cases which may have impact on the network
architecture.
NOTE: Additional Non-3GPP identities are FFS

## 7.21 Key Issue -- Network Discovery and Selection {#key-issue-network-
discovery-and-selection .Style-Heading-2}
### 7.21.1 Description of Key Issue Network Discovery and Selection
In legacy 3GPP accesses well established principles for Network Discovery and
Selection (NW-DS) are applied, both in idle and active mode (e.g. 3GPP TSs
22.011, 22.102, 23.122, 43.129 and 23.060). It is expected that these can be
extended for LTE access in SAE quite naturally. Regarding non-3GPP access,
full alignment and exchange of configuration data between 3GPP and non-3GPP
domains are unlikely.
Also, the presumably more localized nature of non-3GPP access NWs (e.g. WLANs)
will lead to an increase in discovery procedures and in an increased number of
decision points for NW selections. It is necessary to optimize NW-DS
procedures for frequent mobility events.
Access NW discovery of non-3GPP RATs, e.g. WLAN, depends largely on passive
scanning or active probing of radio channels (potentially in parallel to
active transmission), which is costly in terms of power consumption and
processing. It is desirable that the concept for NW-DS in SAE supports
effective means for minimizing processing.
For seamless handovers to/from/between non-3GPP access(es) within SAE,
according to stated requirements, the latency of NW-DS procedures is crucial.
But the time criticality is different in different handover situations.
**Looking at the currently defined NW-DS principles for I-WLAN in [28] it
becomes clear that they cannot be extended for time critical handovers and for
other RATs, due to complexity and latency:**
\- per available WLAN access NW a scan/probe has to be performed
\- if a WLAN AN is connected to more than one 3GPP NW this is only detected
after L2 association and trying authentication
**It is therefore necessary to develop or adopt new, more efficient
mechanisms, for both idle and active mode (where this differentiation is
applicable).**
Editor's note: a problem statement potentially related to this key issue is
found in draft-ietf-eap-netsel-problem-05.
Editor's note: it is necessary to cross-check with the work being done in SA1
under WID "I-WLAN NSP" and WID "Non-3GPP access NSP".
### 7.21.2 Solutions for Key Issue Network Discovery and Selection
**These may include:**
\- solutions based on concepts developed in other fora (e.g. IEEE 802.11u,
IEEE 802.21, IETF)
\- solutions based on concepts defined by 3GPP (e.g. provision of specific
databases)
**Further mechanisms are FFS. When selecting solutions, the amount of
signalling, size of stored and transferred data, especially over the radio
interface, and terminal power consumption shall be taken into account.**
## 7.22 Key Issue -- Voice service continuity between cdma2000 1xRTT Revision
A and E-UTRA
### 7.22.1 Description of key issue Voice Service Continuity between cdma2000
1xRTT Revision A and E-UTRA
The intent of this clause is to study alternative solutions for Service
continuity between IMS over EPS/E-UTRA access and CS domain over cdma2000
1xRTT Revision A access ([36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [43], [44]) as
per the Stage 1 requirements in 3GPP TS 22.278 [34]. The initial focus is put
on voice call continuity, however the study on continuity of other services
shall not be precluded.
NOTE: The CS component of cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A is not expected to be
connected to the EPC.
In the following desirable characteristics for proposed solutions are listed:
\- The solution should support bi-directional service continuity between
cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A and E-UTRA. If bi-directional support is not
practical, then service continuity from E-UTRA to cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A
shall have the higher priority.
\- The solution shall allow coexistence and be compatible with REL-7 VCC (as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.206 [29]).
\- The solution shall allow coexistence with REL-8 VCC and ICS.
\- In order to permit UEs with a single radio configuration the solutions
shall not require UE and/or RAT capability to simultaneously signal on two
different RATs.
\- The solution should aim for commonality in the solution for support of
single radio and dual radio terminals.
\- The solution should be transparent to E-UTRA only terminal or network.
\- The solution should not have any impact on deployed cdma2000 1xRTT Rev A
and cdma2000 HRPD Rev 0 and Rev A terminals.
\- The solution should minimize the coupling between the E-UTRAN and the 3GPP2
access. In particular, the solution should allow the cdma2000 1xRTT Rev A
specification to evolve without necessitating a modification to the E-UTRA(N)
specifications.
\- Impact on service quality, e.g. QoS, interruption times should be minimized
\- RAT/domain selection/change should be under network control.
\- RAT/domain selection/change may be restricted to some access systems and
some subscribers, depending on operators' policies.
\- It shall be possible for operators to restrict and disable the handover of
voice calls across different access domains even if voice call services are
available separately from those domains.
Editor\'s Note: The triggering for domain change, either UE initiated or
network initiated, is FFS.
\- In roaming cases, the Visited PLMN should control the RAT/domain
selection/change while taking into account any related HPLMN policies
\- Inter-domain handover in the VPLMN should be performed without significant
amount of signalling to the HPLMN.
\- Impact on legacy cdma2000 RAT is highly undesirable
\- Impact on legacy cdma2000 CS CN is undesirable
### 7.22.2 Alternative solution A
#### 7.22.2.1 Description
The solution for E-UTRA/EPS  1xRTT voice service continuity described in this
section is similar to the existing 3GPP2 solution for HRPD1xRTT voice service
continuity specified in [X.P0042].
Figure 7.22.2.1-1: Proposed architecture for E-UTRA/EPS to 1xRTT voice service
continuity
In this solution it is proposed to terminate the S102 interface (defined in
[X.P0042]) between the MME and the Interworking Solution function (IWS),
defined in [A.S0008-C v1.0]. This interface is labelled in EPS as S102.
The role of the IWS is:
\- To be a signalling tunnelling end point towards the E-UTRAN/EPS MME for
receiving/sending encapsulated 1xRTT CS signalling messages to/from the UE,
and
\- To emulate an 1xRTT BSS towards the 1xRTT MSC (reference point A1). No
modifications to the existing MSCs are expected.
The role of the MME is:
\- To be a signalling tunnelling end point towards the IWS (in [A.S0008-C
v1.0]) for sending/receiving encapsulated 1xRTT CS signalling messages to/from
the UE, which are encapsulated in EPS NAS messages (UE-MME)
For VCC-capable UEs the call is always anchored at the VCC AS in the IMS. The
IWS enables a single radio UE to communicate in parallel both with the source
system and the target system. From VCC perspective this mechanism allows for
\"make-before-break\" operation similar to dual radio VCC i.e. it allows for
transport of signalling for establishment of the target CS access leg while
the terminal is connected to the source PS access network.
Figure 7.22.2.1-2: Transport of 1xRTT CS signalling messages for preparation
of the CS access leg in the target system
The S102 reference point is used to convey 1xRTT CS signalling messages
between MME and IWS. These 1xRTT CS signalling messages are actually exchanged
between the UE and the MSC, and S102 is only one link in the overall UE-MSC
tunnelling path. On the remaining portion of the tunnelling path, the 1xRTT
signalling messages are encapsulated in EUTRAN/EPS tunnelling messages (UE-
MME) or carried as part of A1 signalling (IWS-MSC).
It is expected that the existing A21 protocol (specified in [A.S0008-C v1.0])
can be re-used on S102.
##### 7.22.2.1.1 Call flow
Figure 7.22.2.1.1-1 illustrates a high-level call flow for the LTE-to-1x voice
service continuity procedure.
Figure 7.22.2.1.1-1: LTE VoIP-to-1x CS voice service continuity
1\. Ongoing VoIP session over the IMS access leg established over EPS/EUTRAN
access.
2\. Based on some trigger (e.g., measurement reports), the EUTRAN makes a
determination to initiate an inter-technology handover to cdma2000 1xRTT Rev
A.
3\. The EUTRAN signals the UE to perform an inter-technology handover.
4\. The UE performs signalling for establishment of the CS access leg. The
1xRTT CS signalling exchanged between the UE and the MSC is tunnelled inside
EUTRAN/EPS tunnelling to the MME and then further tunnelled inside S102
messages to the IWS.
Editor's Note: The A21 signalling as defined in 3GPP2 provides indications as
to the type of messages being signalled. In particular, indications that a
particular message represents a traffic channel assignment message is
provided. This can be used by the EPS system to release resources, if desired.
5\. Once the UE receives the traffic channel information from the cdma2000
1xRTT Rev A system, the UE retunes to the 1xRTT radio access network and
performs traffic channel acquisition with the 1xRTT BSS.
Editor's note: It is FFS how eNodeB determines that the UE left the eNodeB due
to 1xRTT handoff or due to bad radio coverage (e.g. dead spot).
6\. The UE sends a 1xRTT handoff completion message to the 1xRTT BSS.
7\. The 1xRTT BSS sends an assignment complete message to the 1xRTT MSC.
8\. Ongoing voice call over the CS access leg established over 1xRTT access
9\. The EUTRAN/EPS context may by released based on the normal EUTRAN/EPS
procedure.
#### 7.22.2.2 Impact on the baseline CN architecture
The solution requires a new interface between MME towards the IWS function in
the 1xRTT network referred to as S102. It is expected that the existing 3GPP2
defined A21 interface shall be used for the preparation and execution of the
handoff procedures between LTE and cdma2000 1xRTT CS. The working assumption
is that no modifications will be required to the currently defined
specification for the A21 interface.
#### 7.22.2.3 Impact on the baseline RAN architecture
E-UTRA(N) should support measurements of cdma2000 channels from the EUTRAN,
similar to that which is already defined for UTRAN. It should also support the
ability to trigger a handover to the cdma2000 system, similar to that which is
already defined for UTRAN.
Other aspects are FFS.
#### 7.22.2.4 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
UE should support measurements of cdma2000 channels from the EUTRAN, similar
to that which is already defined for UTRAN. UE should support a tunnelling
protocol for tunnelling 1xRTT CS signalling messages inside EPS NAS
signalling.
Other aspects are FFS.

\- How to achieve mobility within the Evolved Access System?
\- Is the evolved access system envisioned to work on new and/or existing
frequency band?
\- Is connecting the Evolved RAN to the pre-SAE/LTE PS core needed?
\- How to add support for non-3GPP access systems?
\- WLAN 3GPP IP access system might need some new functionality for Inter-
system Mobility with the Evolved Access System
\- Clarify which interfaces are the roaming interfaces, and how roaming works
in general

Access Systems to support UEs in discovering alternative Access Systems ? How
is such advertising performed (e.g. system broadcast, requested by UE, ...) ?
How do these procedures impact battery lifetime ?
\- In case Access Systems advertise other Access Systems: will any Access

is a hierarchy of Access Systems needed to provide seamless coverage for
continuous advertisement ?
\- Is user access control/authentication per access system or more centralized
for multiple access systems ?
\- How are Access Systems, PLMNs and operators discovered and selected ? Can a
UE access/attach multiple PLMN/operator in parallel ? If yes, how many ? Or,
has a UE to select the same PLMN/operator for each Access System in case the
UE accesses/attaches multiple Access systems in parallel?
\- How many identities and temporary identities has a UE/subscriber? For every
Access System another identity? In case of multiple identities: is user
context transfer and identity translation required at a change of the Access
System to avoid re-authentication?
\- In case a UE accesses/attaches multiple Access Systems in parallel: how
does reservation of guaranteed resources work? Are multiple reservations in
parallel required (same resource on every Access System) to allow for fast
change between Access Systems ? Or, does a mobility/handover mechanism reserve
resources during the mobility/handover process ?
\- Shall inter Access System mechanisms and signalling for load sharing and
mobility be generic for all Access Systems or peer-to-peer between Access
Systems ?
\- Will any Access Systems have an idle or paging mode ? And, shall the wake-
up work over multiple Access Systems (e.g. paging in multiple Access Systems
in parallel) ?
\- Are User or UE access and service rights specific per Access Systems or
common for all or multiple Access Systems ?
\- How many network nodes are between UE and top level mobility anchor ? And
is there only one set traffic plane functions for user data (policing and
charging) ? Or, may the traffic plane functions change during an ongoing
service because of an Access System change?
\- Are there layers of multiple Access Systems in same physical location
required ? And how dynamic do Ues change between different Access Systems in
the same location in idle and in connected mode? What signalling traffic is
acceptable during such mobility (e.g. signalling via HPLMN) and how does it
influence system performance and QoS (e.g. packet loss / service interruption
during change of Access System)?
\- May functions be transferred to application/services level (e.g. mobility
supported by IMS services) ? If yes, to which extent is this feasible for
application/services ?
\- Does every Access System provide its own security mechanisms (encryption,
integrity) ? Is a parameter mapping between different security mechanisms
possible? Or, can security associations be established in parallel to ongoing
services ?
\- How is data compression provided for the different access systems ? And how
re-synchronizes compression when the access system changes ?
###### ### Annex B: Summary of different high level architecture proposals
Editor\'s note: Now that a common high level architecture proposal has been
added to clause 4.2, further contributions to this annex are NOT expected.
## B.0 General
Current company inputs have been summarized into the following 2 separate high
level architecture figures. These figures represent the spectrum of company
inputs. The key differences between the two figures are:
a) Inter-access-system mobility is achieved differently;
b) Possible difference between PCC functionality, mainly stemming from the
difference in how Inter-AS mobility is provided.
Key issues for further consideration and contributions have been added to the
list of open issues in Annex A.

needed.
###### ### Annex C: Summary of different MM concepts
So far 3 LTE-MM states are identified:
LTE_Detached:
\- The location of the UE is not known by the network (e.g. UE switched off);
LTE_Idle:
\- State in which the UE has a low power consumption and can thus be kept for
many days;
\- Fast state transition to LTE_Active shall be supported (\ UTRAN/ GERAN | Handling of roaming restrictions | Battery saving scheme  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

###### ### Annex D: More detailed descriptions of potential solutions for
limiting signalling due to idle mode mobility between E-UTRA and UTRA/GSM
# D.1 Introduction
This annex provides more information on some potential solutions that could be
used to meet this requirement. Further analysis of these solutions (and other
potential solutions) is needed before a decision is made.
# D.2 Potential Solutions
## D.2.1 Do Nothing
### D.2.1.1 Overview
This does not meet the requirement to minimize the signalling due to idle mode
mobility between E-UTRA and UTRA/GSM, but, is a feasible solution for single-
mode E-UTRA terminals, or, if the E-UTRA coverage does not overlap other
coverage areas, or, if the proportion of \"dual\" mode terminals is low. In
this solution the terminal context in the network is only located in the
network the terminal is currently camping on. As in all other solutions it is
possible to utilize various hysteresis based cell selection criteria
(thresholds, timer based etc.) in order to minimize the risk that the terminal
toggles between different systems.
### D.2.1.2 Advantages
1\. No additional functionality needs to be added to the network architecture.
2\. Possible to utilize any camped state in each access (e.g. URA_PCH).
### D.2.1.3 Drawbacks
1\. The camped terminal needs to signal the network at every inter-access cell
change leading to unnecessary signalling load.
2\. There is also a higher risk that the terminal will miss a page message
from the network since the number of inter-access tracking area updates might
be higher in this solution.
## D.2.2 Common Routeing Area and common SGSN
### D.2.2.1 Overview
Placing the GSM and UMTS cells into the same LA and RA is the basic part of
the UMTS/GSM solution. However this does mean that both the MSC and SGSN are
shared between 2G and 3G. The SGSN has to support both the Gb and Iu-ps
interfaces and their different RAN/CN functional splits.
From a standardisation point of view, it would be relatively easy to extend
this concept to cover E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM. However, from an implementation
point of view, this requires the development core network nodes that support
all of the Gb, the Iu-ps AND the E-UTRA RAN-CN interface.
In addition, the \"signalling free movement between 2G and 3G\" only applies
in the \"idle\" state (GPRS-Standby to PMM idle) and means that the URA-PCH
state does not get utilised to its full benefits.
### D.2.2.2 Advantages
1\. Tracking areas that overlap multiple RATs are supported which reduces
signalling, assuming the E-UTRA/UTRA/GSM cells belong to the same CN node area
### D.2.2.3 Drawbacks
1\. Required combined PS nodes (or CS nodes) for different accesses (2G/3G,
SAE / LTE)
2\. Slower transition from camped to active state when the terminal is in
UTRAN since it is not possible to utilize camped state containing RAN context
in UTRAN (e.g. URA_PCH) and at the same time perform signalling free inter-RAT
cell changes.
## D.2.3 Common RAN / CN for E-UTRA / UTRA
### D.2.3.1 Overview
With \"basic GSM\" and \"EDGE\", and with GSM in different frequency bands
(900, 1800, etc), a common BSC can be used with all the cells in the same
LA/RA.
A similar technique could be used for connecting E-UTRA and UTRA cells to the
same RAN / CN. The terminal would operate using a common upper layer protocol
stack for both E-UTRA and UTRA. Only the lower layers would be different
depending on which technology the terminal is connected to. In this solution
UTRA cells (at least HsxPA capable ones) are supported in the SAE / LTE
architecture either using combined E-UTRA / UTRA nodes or using new or
modified interfaces between UTRA and E-UTRA nodes. This does constrain the
E-UTRA architecture since it needs to support UTRA cells, but it would permit
the URA-PCH/long live Iu-ps connections to be maintained.
### D.2.3.2 Advantages
1\. Tracking areas that overlap E-UTRAN and UTRAN are supported, which reduces
signalling
2\. It is possible to utilize a concept similar to URA_PCH where tracking
areas can overlap each other, which avoids hard tracking area borders.
### D.2.3.3 Drawbacks
1\. Tracking areas do not overlap E-UTRAN and GERAN.
2\. Require that UTRA cells are integrated in the SAE / LTE network either
using combined UTRA / E-UTRA nodes or using new or modified interfaces between
UTRA and E-UTRA nodes.
## D.2.4 Equivalent Routeing Areas and SGSN proxy
### D.2.4.1 Architectural overview
The description of this mechanism is based on the architectural picture
indicated below.
NOTE 1: These techniques may also be applicable to other architectural
concepts (e.g. there could be an E-UTRA RNC in between the AP box and the
UP/CP-GW boxes).
NOTE 2: The use of some \"GPRS terminology\" does NOT imply that these
interfaces/functions are reused by LTE/SAE, rather, the terms are just used to
aid comprehension of the concept.
NOTE 3: Equivalent routing areas will probably not be possible to support
networks using only CS speech services in one access (e.g. GSM) and only PS
speech services in another access (e.g. SAE / LTE), since CS paging will only
be supported in one of the two accesses (FFS).
Figure D.1: architecture overview
In this architecture, the \"2G/3G packet core\" connects to the \"evolved
packet core\" as follows:
\- the user plane from the 2G/3G SGSN connects to the User Plane GateWay via
the GTP-U part of Gn.
\- the control plane part of the Gn interface connects the 2G/3G SGSN to the
Control Plane GateWay via a somewhat modified GTP-C part of Gn.
\- for E-UTRA capable Ues, the SGSN does not send MAP signalling to the
HLR/HSS. Instead these functions are proxied across \"Gr minus\" to the CP-GW.
The CP-GW has a Gr _reference point_ between it and the HSS/AAA.
Between the E-UTRA Access Point and the core network:
\- the interfaces need not be based on GTP/Iu, however, the same functional
split might apply.
The GateWay:
\- is split into separate Control Plane and User Plane units, and
\- should support the concept that more than one \"APN\" may need to be
supported (e.g. for Ipv4 and Ipv6, and/or for Corporate access and Public
Operator MMS/IMS service), with each APN potentially being on different User
Plane GateWays.
### D.2.4.2 Concept: Equivalent Routeing Areas
The concept is summarised as follows:
a) the E-UTRA Access Points and UTRA/GSM cells are in separate Routeing
(Tracking) Areas.
b) Upon Attach and RA update, the UE is \"accepted\" into multiple, Equivalent
Routeing Areas. Typically, one is for E-UTRA and one is for UTRA/GSM. The UE
may be allocated different P-TMSIs in the different Tracking Areas.
c) When the mobile moves between (E-UTRA) LTE-IDLE and an \"inactive\" UTRA
state, the UE does no signalling to the network (as long as the new cell is
within one of the set of Equivalent Routeing Areas). The \"inactive\" UTRA
states are RRC-IDLE and URA-PCH. The nature of CELL-PCH and CELL-FACH are FFS.
d) Movement to E-UTRA from UTRA by mobiles in URA-PCH does NOT cause the Iu-PS
connection to be released. This permits fast reconnection of the UE\'s data
flow if the mobile later returns to UTRA.
e) While in E-UTRA, the UE keeps the periodic URA update timer running. If
this expires while not in UTRA coverage, the UTRA will release the Iu
connection, so when the UE next returns to UTRA coverage, it enters PMM-IDLE
state.
f) If the new cell is in a Routeing Area that is not within the List of
Equivalent Ras (LERA) stored in the UE, then the normal RAU procedure is
performed.
g) When the mobile changes RAT while in an \"active\" state, UE-network
signalling takes place to ensure that user data is correctly routed. The
\"active\" states include LTE-active, UTRA-Cell-DCH and GPRS-Ready.
h) For E-UTRA UEs, GMM and SM contexts in the SGSN and the CP-GW are
synchronised by the SGSN proxying GMM and SM signalling to the CP-GW, and, by
using a \'context reference number\' (CRN). Whenever the UE modifies its SM or
GMM state via E-UTRA, the CRN is updated. When the UE accesses via UTRA or 2G,
the UE sends the CRN to the SGSN. If the SGSN detects a CRN mismatch, the SGSN
pulls the SM and GMM context from the CP-GW. Changes in the security context
that are made on E-UTRA may be pushed towards the SGSN(s) in advance of the UE
leaving E-UTRA.
i) The Periodic RA Update Timer is replaced with a Periodic SMU Timer, running
between the UE and the CP-GW.
j) If needed, Mobile Terminating activities based on MSISDN/IMSI (e.g.
Location Services, SMS) are routed to the CP-GW.
k) The Access Point informs the UP-GW(s) from which it has sent/received data
if the UE leaves the LTE-Active state.
l) When the mobile is in LTE-idle and a downlink IP packet arrives at the User
Plane Gateway (UP-GW) entity of the GW, then the UP-GW entity contacts the
Control Plane Gateway (CP-GW), and the CP-GW initiates the Paging procedure in
all of that UE\'s Equivalent RAIs. (Extra details are given below).
### D.2.4.3 LERA Management
The CP-GW could manage LERA and update the LERA to the UE in the corresponding
set of Equivalent Ras. For paging process, CP-GW could send paging to the APs
and SGSN according to the LERA it stores. SGSN does not have to store the
LERA, nor has to take part into the LERA management, since the normal routing
area update process will be performed.
After registration with HSS via CP-GW is finished in RA update process or in
network attachment, the CP-GW may include the LERA in the confirm message to
the UE.
Figure D.2 shows how the LERA is allocated for UE when UE initiates a routing
area update request or attach request via 2G/3G SGSN.
Figure D.2: Information flow for LERA management
1\. UE sends RA Update Request or Attach Request to 2G/3G SGSN.
2\. Other steps in RA update or Attachment processes, such as security
functions.
3\. if UE is in a legacy network, SGSN sends the registration request to the
CP-GW. The registration request includes the legacy RAI, CP-GW then forwards
the request to HSS.
4\. HSS sends registration confirm message to CP-GW.
5\. If UE is in a legacy network, CP-GW sends the registration confirm message
including LERA to SGSN according the legacy RAI, and SGSN will forwards the
message to UE.
### D.2.4.4 Downlink data flow to an \"inactive\" UE
#### D.2.4.4.1 Solution A
When downlink packets are received at the UP-GW and the UE is in LTE-Active
state, a (virtual) connection between the UP-GW and the AP may already exist
for the UE. If such a connection exists, the UP-GW sends the packets directly
to the AP.
After the expiry of the LTE-Active State Timer in the AP, the AP and UP-GW
release the connection between them for that UE. No user plane transmission
path for the UE exists for future packets received in the downlink.
When a downlink packet arrives the procedure described below is applied:
The UE may be in LTE-Active state as a result of signalling between UE and the
core network and/or data transmission through a different UP-GW. In this case,
a \'disconnected\' UP-GW also acts as described below when a downlink packet
arrives.
Figure D.3: Transfer from Idle to Active states for Ues caused by downlink
Traffic whilst in EUTRA coverage
0 The User Plane Gateway has two flags associated with the \"PDP context\".
One indicates whether the UE is in \"LTE-active or not\". The other indicates
whether the last \"GTP-U tunnel\" to be used was \"on E-UTRA or on UTRA/2G\".
1 A downlink packet is received in a UP-GW function and the \"LTE-active or
not\" flag indicates \"not\".
2 If the \"last used tunnel\" flag in the UP-GW indicates that the UE was last
in the coverage of the SGSN, then the UP-GW sends the downlink packet to the
UTRA/2G SGSN.
A When received by a 2G-SGSN:
I If the MS is in the Ready state then the SGSN sends the packet to the BSS.
II If the MS is in the Standby state, then the SGSN initiates paging for the
MS, AND immediately returns a copy of the Packet to the UP-GW with an
indication that parallel \"paging in a wider area\" is required. Once the 2G
paging process has been completed, the SGSN returns an indication to the UP-GW
of whether the MS was reachable or not (in 2G coverage).
B When received by a 3G-SGSN:
I If an Iu connection for this UE exists, the SGSN forwards this packet to the
RNC on the Iu connection. If the UE is in URA_PCH or CELL_PCH, the RNC
immediately returns a copy of the packet to the UP-GW, via the SGSN, with an
indication that parallel \"paging in a wider area\" is required, AND, in
parallel initiates paging in the URA/CELL. Once the UTRA paging process has
been completed, the RNC sends the UP-GW an indication of whether the MS was
reachable or not.\ \ If the UE is in Cell_DCH, the packet is delivered to the
mobile.
II If an Iu connection for this UE does not exist, the SGSN immediately
returns a copy of the packet to the UP-GW with an indication that parallel
\"paging in a wider area\" is required, AND, the SGSN initiates paging for
this UE in UTRA. Once the paging process has been completed, an indication of
whether the UE was reachable or not is sent to the UP-GW.
3 When receiving a downlink packet from the Gi interface when the \"last used
tunnel\" flag in the UP-GW indicates that the UE was last in EUTRA coverage
(and the \"LTE-Active or not\" flag is set to \"not\"), then, the UP-GW will
contact the CP-GW requesting paging to be initiated for this UE.
Also, if the UP-GW receives a copy of a packet from an RNC/3G SGSN/2G SGSN
with a request for \"paging in a wider area\" the UP-GW will contact the CP-GW
requesting paging to be initiated for this UE in other areas.
4 The CP-GW sends a Paging message to all the Aps and SGSN which are part of
Ras that have been allocated to the UE (and which are not yet paging the
mobile), including the parameters needed to page the UE (c.f. IMSI in 2G/3G).
5 The UE is paged on each of the E-UTRA, UTRA and 2G Cells that are contained
within the list of Equivalent RAIs allocated to the UE.
6 When the UE receives the Paging message it responds with the Service
Request/Cell Update message (or E-UTRA equivalent). In EUTRA this message
contains enough information for the AP to gather the context for the UE
(either directly from the last registered AP or from the CP-GW). In UTRA/2G,
the SGSN indicates to the CP-GW that the mobile has responded to paging.
7 The AP (or SGSN) then creates the connection to the UP-GW (via the CP-GW in
the case of an SGSN). When the connection is created to the UP-GW the IP
packet buffered for the UE is sent on the connection to the AP (or SGSN).
8 The AP informs the CP-GW that it controls the UE, and the CP-GW passes the
QoS information to the AP for this flow.
9 The CP-GW informs the UP-GW that the Paging procedure to locate the UE was
successfully completed.
#### D.2.4.4.2 Solution B
Figure D.4: Transfer from Idle to Active states for UE caused by downlink
traffic arriving while UE is in LTE IDLE
0 The User Plane Gateway has a flag associated with the \"PDP context\", which
indicates whether the UE is in \"LTE-active or not\".
1 A downlink packet is received in a UP-GW function and the \"LTE-active or
not\" flag indicates \"not\" or a copy of a packet from RNC with a request for
\" paging in a wider area\" is received in a UP-GW function.
2 UP-GW sends paging request to CP-GW, the paging request should indicate if
\"paging in a wider area\" is requested.
3 CP-GW checks UE MM states, if UE is in PMM-CONNECTED State/GPRS-READY State,
then go to step 6, if UE is in PMM-IDLE State/GPRS-STANDBY State or LTE-IDLE
State, or the paging request from UP-GW indicates \"paging in a wider area\"
then go to step 4.
4 The CP-GW sends a Paging message to all the Aps and SGSN which are part of
Ras that have been allocated to the UE (and which are not yet paging the
mobile), including the parameters needed to page the UE (c.f. IMSI in 2G/3G).
The UE is paged on each of the E-UTRA, UTRA and 2G Cells that are contained
within the list of Equivalent RAIs allocated to the UE.
5 When the UE receives the Paging message it responds with the Service
Request/Cell Update message (or E-UTRA equivalent). In E-UTRA this message
contains enough information for the AP to gather the context for the UE
(either directly from the last registered AP or from the CP-GW). In UTRA/2G,
the SGSN indicates to the CP-GW that the mobile has responded to paging.
6 CP-GW sends paging response to UP-GW, which indicates if UE is now in
coverage of UTRA/GERA. When UP-GW receives paging response, which indicates
that UE is now in coverage of UTRA/GERA, then the UP-GW sends the downlink
packet to the 2G/3G SGSN.
If the UE is in URA_PCH or CELL_PCH, the RNC immediately returns a copy of the
packet to the UP-GW, via the SGSN, with an indication that parallel \"paging
in a wider area\" is required, AND, in parallel initiates paging in the
URA/CELL. Once the UTRA paging process has been completed, the RNC sends the
UP-GW an indication of whether the UE was reachable or not.
If the UE is in Cell_DCH, the packet is delivered to the mobile.
7 User plane connection will be established between UP-GW and UE (User plane
connection could be controlled by the CP-GW). The AP informs the CP-GW that it
controls the UE, and the CP-GW passes the QoS information to the AP for this
flow.
8 When the connection is created to the UP-GW the IP packet buffered for the
UE is sent on the connection to the AP (or SGSN).
### D.2.4.5 Summary
It is believed that, the description given above in Annex D, clause D.2.4
shows that this mechanism can limit \"inactive mode signalling\" while
maintaining the E-UTRA core network separate from the 2G/UTRA core network.
Upgrades to existing equipment are necessary, but these upgrades appear to be
limited to software.
There are two main differences between Solution A and B
1) In Solution B, UP-GW won't send downlink data to SGSN unless it knows there
is Iu connection by information from CP-GW, so that UP-GW could handle the
downlink data more efficiently.
2) UE shall always activate PDP context when it register with SGSN for
Solution A, but for Solution B, it's not necessary to activate PDP context in
the coverage of SGSN if there is neither uplink nor downlink data for the UE.
This may benefit the UE when the UE first registers in SAE network, then moves
to the coverage of SGSN, in which case, UE doesn't activate PDP context again
to SGSN if there is neither uplink nor downlink data for UE.
### D.2.4.6 Advantages
Editor\'s Note: This list is suitable for both Solution A and Solution B for
Equivalent Routing area concept..
1\. Allows overlapping tracking areas between E-UTRA / UTRA and GSM regardless
which tracking area concept is used in each technology, which reduces
signalling.
2\. It is possible to assign multiple tracking areas to the terminal, which
avoids hard tracking area borders also within each access.
### D.2.4.7 Drawbacks
Editor\'s Note: this list is suitable for both Solution A and Solution B for
Equivalent Routing area concept.
1\. Requires updates to existing GERAN / UTRAN networks to support the
equivalent tracking area concept.
## D.2.5 UE remains camped on the last used RAT
### D.2.5.1 Description
In this solution, the network knows the technology in which the mobile can be
reached, and the paging is performed in that particular technology alone. This
will require that the mobile make a location area/tracking area update
whenever it makes an idle mode handover from one technology to another.
Initial coverage of E-UMTS will be spotty compared to UMTS. Therefore, if the
network needs to know the current technology in which the mobile can be
reached, there will be a high tracking area update signalling load on the
network due to idle mode handovers. It would be best if we can avoid this kind
of signalling load by reducing idle mode handovers.
The main idea of this option is that the mobile continues to remain camped in
the technology in which it last did a tracking area update, unless it enters a
region where there is no coverage of that particular technology. For example,
if a mobile did its last location area update in UMTS technology, it continues
to remain in UMTS technology and makes its location area updates as per UMTS
location areas for as long as there is UMTS coverage. Even if it enters E-UMTS
coverage areas, if there is still UMTS coverage, it continues to remain in the
UMTS technology. When the mobile needs to be paged, it is paged in the UMTS
technology, and if there is E-UMTS coverage in that area as well, and if
operator and mobile policies are such that E-UMTS is the preferred technology,
then an active mode handover is carried out to the E-UMTS technology.
A minor modification of the above idea would be to have the mobile camped on
the last used RAT for a certain period of time before switching over to the
preferred RAT when under common coverage. This builds in a certain amount of
hysterisis to reduce signalling load and at the same time reduce the
occurrence of active mode handover.
The main advantage that this technique offers is that the location
area/tracking area signalling load is reduced, while still allowing the
network to know the exact technology in which the mobile can be reached. This
benefit is obtained by postponing any inter-technology handovers in idle mode
until it is actually required, i.e. when it loses coverage in the technology
in which it made its last tracking area update, or when it needs to move to
active mode and the alternate technology is the preferred technology for
active data transfers.
### D.2.5.2 Advantages
1\. Paging in a single technology alone is required at all times.
2\. No additional functionality needs to be added to the network architecture.
3\. Reduced signalling load compared to the scheme where a tracking area
update is sent when a new preferred technology is available.
### D.2.5.3 Drawbacks
1\. Imposes a restriction on the mobile to not perform idle mode handovers
when coverage of the previous technology exists.
2\. Requires an inter-technology handoff at the time of call setup, if the
mobile is in the coverage area of a preferred technology, while still in idle
mode in a different technology.
3\. If UMTS coverage is more extensive than E-UTRA coverage, then the mobile
will frequently be initiating access from UMTS. These accesses are unlikely to
achieve the E-UTRA performance requirements for the transition time for moving
from Idle to active mode data transfer.
## D.2.6 Packet Data Bearer Proxy
### D.2.6.1 Architectural overview
The description of this mechanism is based on the picture shown below.
Figure D.5: architecture overview
In this mechanism the UPE is in the data path of the packet data bearer
provided by the 2G/3G SGSN. The UE registers with SGSN and receives TMSI and
RA from SGSN. And the UE establishes a packet data bearer, which has the UPE
in the data path. A subsequent registration with the MME maintains the TMSI
and RA from SGSN and allocates in addition TMSI and RA from MME to UE. The UE
remains registered at SGSN and the SGSN at HSS. After this registration with
MME the UE may change between 2G/3G access and Evolved RAN without any
registration signalling.
Uplink data the UE may send to the 2G/3G SGSN or to the MME/UPE. Both are in
the data path of the UE\'s packet bearer service. Downlink data are duplicated
by the MME/UPE and duplicates are forwarded to the 2G/3G SGSN so that both
SGSN and MME/UPE start paging. Data are sent by that entity, which receives
the paging response from the UE.
### D.2.6.2 Information flow: registration and downlink data transfer
Figure D.6: message flow
0) In case the UE performs its first registration with MME/UPE this is
performed as without any optimisation for limiting idle state signalling. The
mechanism starts when the UE registers with the 2G/3G SGSN, e.g. because of
selecting 2G/3G access.
1) The UE registers with the 2G/3G SGSN.
2) The 2G/3G SGSN registers at HSS and retrieves subscriber data, e.g.
authentication data.
3) In case of successful authentication/authorisation the SGSN accepts the UE
registration.
4) The UE request the establishment of the default IP bearer service if not
already established. The packet bearer service is established by the SGSN
towards the MME/UPE. The MME/UPE establishes the packet bearer service towards
the inter AS MM. As a result of the IP bearer service establishment the
MME/UPE is in the data path of the packet bearer service provided by the SGSN.
5) The UE changes to the Evolved RAN.
6) The UE sends a registration request to the MME/UPE and sends old TMSI and
old RA.
7) The MME/UPE requests subscriber data from SGSN. The SGSN address is derived
from old TMSI/RA. The UE is identified by old TMSI/RA.
8) The MME/UPE confirms the registration and allocates new TMSI/RA to the UE.
And the MME/UPE sends the old TMSI/RA to the UE for the 2G/3G SGSN. The 2G/3G
SGSN remains registered at HSS. The UE may change between 2G/3G and LTE access
without network registration.
9) Downlink data arrive at MME/UPE.
10) The MME/UPE stores data and forwards duplicates to the SGSN.
11) The SGSN pages the UE in the 2G/3G RA.
12) The MME/UPE pages the UE in the RA of the Evolved RAN.
13a) In case the UE responds to the SGSN the SGSN sends data to the UE in step
14a).
13b) In case the UE responds to the MME/UPE the MME/UPE sends data to the UE
in step 14b).
In case URA_PCH shall be included in idle state handling an inactivity timer
in MME/UPE may be used to decide whether paging is performed on last used RAT
or on all RATs. Alternatively, a message from UTRAN to MME/UPE may indicate
the transfer to URA_PCH, which causes paging in all RATs instead of URA-only.
### D.2.6.3 Advantages
1\. Allows Ues to be registered in Tracking Areas of E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN,
which reduces signalling for idle state Ues.
2\. Can be applied without modifying 2G or 3G SGSNs.
3\. Can handle URA_PCH as idle state allowing for fast transitions from camped
to active state when the UE is on UTRAN.
4\. Allows to limit updates by Ues at TA borders by overlapping Tas or by
confirming multiple TA at least for SAE/LTE (for 2G/3G see drawbacks).
5\. Does not require Gr (MAP) at the SAE entities.
### D.2.6.4 Drawbacks
1\. Some potential limitations as subscriber control and registration with HSS
remains on SGSN and control on SAE entities is via bearer service control. The
specific limitations are FFS.
2\. Some modification of the SGSN (multiple TA in update confirmation) needed
to further improve the amount of idle state signalling reduction.
3\. Some modification of the SGSN and RNC (signalling of transition to URA_PCH
to SAE entity) needed to further improve the amount of idle state signalling
reduction if URA_PCH is handled as an idle state.
4\. The LTE MME/UPE is on the signalling and data path for 2G/3G access, which
is no drawback when MME/UPE and Inter AS MM are combined into one network
entity.
## D.2.7 Inter RAT Resource Allocation
### D.2.7.1 Architectural overview
The description of this mechanism is based on the picture shown below.
Figure D.7: architecture overview
The UE registers with the MME/UPE and receives a TMSI, an RA of the Evolved
RAN and an RA from 2G/3G access. The MME/UPE registers with the HSS. After
this registration with MME/UPE the UE may change between 2G/3G access and
Evolved RAN without any registration signalling.
When downlink data arrive at MME/UPE the MME/UPE starts paging in the RA of
the Evolved RAN and the MME/UPE requests the SGSN to page the UE within the
2G/3G RA. When the UE responds to the MME/UPE data are sent by the MME/UPE to
the UE. When the UE responds to the SGSN a data path is established between
MME/UPE and SGSN and data are sent by the SGSN to the UE.
For uplink data transfer the UE request MME/UPE or SGSN, respectively to
establish data transfer resources. When the UE camps on Evolved RAN this is
straightforward like without this mechanism of reducing idle state signalling.
When the UE camps on 2G/3G access the SGSN establishes in addition a data path
to the MME/UPE and forwards data received from the UE to the MME/UPE. The SGSN
derives the serving MME/UPE from information sent by the UE (e.g. the RA of
the Evolved RAN) or the SGSN could receive such information from the MME/UPE
already during the UE\'s registration.
### D.2.7.2 Information flow: registration and uplink/downlink data transfer
Figure D.8: message flow
0) In case the UE performs its first registration with 2G/3G this is performed
as without any optimisation for limiting idle state signalling. The mechanism
starts when the UE registers with the MME/UPE, e.g. because of selecting LTE
access. Alternatively, the SGSN may confirm 2G/3G TMSI/Ras and Evolved RAN
TMSI/Ras to the UE. This allows the UE to change between 2G/3G and LTE in idle
state without any update signalling. This alternative requires SGSN
modifications.
1) The UE request registration at the MME/UPE.
2) The MME/UPE registers at HSS and retrieves subscriber data, e.g.
authentication data.
3) In case of successful authentication/authorisation the MME/UPE accepts the
UE registration and sends TMSi and Ras from Evolved RAN and from 2G/3G access
to UE. In case this is the network attach the UE is provided with the IP
configuration. This step may include communication between MME/UPE and SGSN to
derive 2G/3G RA and TMSI and to establish a UE context in the SGSN.
4) The UE camps on 2G/3G access and needs to transfer uplink data. It performs
the Service Request Procedure in case it camps on 3G access.
5) The SGSN establishes a data path with the MME/UPE that serves the UE. The
data path may be established by existing or by enhanced Gn procedures. The
address of the MME/UPE may be stored by the SGSN in an UE context, which is
established in step 3. The UE may be authenticated by the SGSN.
6) The SGSN initiates the RAB establishment.
7) The UE sends uplink user data to the SGSN, which the SGSN forwards to
MME/UPE.
8) Downlink data arrives at MME/UPE.
9) The MME/UPE pages the UE in the RA of the Evolved RAN and the MME/UPE
request the SGSN to page the UE in the 2G/3G RA.
10a) In case the UE responds to the SGSN the SGSN establishes a data path with
the MME/UPE in step 11a) and the MME/UPE sends user data to the UE via SGSN in
step 12a). The data path may be established by existing or by enhanced Gn
procedures.
10b) In case the UE responds to the MME/UPE the MME/UPE sends user data to the
UE in step 121).
In case URA_PCH shall be included in idle state handling an inactivity timer
in MME/UPE may be used to decide whether paging is performed on last used RAT
or on all RATs. Alternatively, a message from UTRAN to MME/UPE may indicate
the transfer to URA_PCH, which causes paging in all RATs instead of URA-only.
### D.2.7.3 Advantages
1\. Allows Ues to be registered in Tracking Areas of E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN,
which reduces signalling for idle state Ues.
2\. Can handle URA_PCH as idle state allowing for fast transitions from camped
to active state when the UE is on UTRAN.
3\. Allows to limit updates by Ues at TA borders by overlapping Tas or by
confirming multiple Tas for every RAT to the UE.
4\. Does not require Gr (MAP) at the SAE entities.
### D.2.7.4 Drawbacks
1\. Some modification of the SGSN needed (multiple TA in update confirmation,
interaction with MME/UPE).
2\. Some modification of the SGSN and RNC (signalling of transition to URA_PCH
to SAE entity) needed if URA_PCH is handled as an idle state.
3\. The LTE MME/UPE is on the signalling and data path for 2G/3G access, which
is no drawback when MME/UPE and the anchor between 3GPP access systems are
combined into one network entity.
## D.2.8 User-IP layer interconnection
### D.2.8.1 Architectural overview
The description of this mechanism is based on the figure as shown below.
Figure D.9: architecture overview
In this mechanism the Inter-AS MM is the mobility anchor using IP based
mobility mechanism (e.g. Mobile IP and any enhancement of it) and is located
within the data path of the packet data bearers provided by both 2G/3G and LTE
system.
The UE subsequently registers with both 2G/3G PS domain and MME/UPE, and
receives two TMSIs and Ras. Accordingly, two different local IP addresses
IP~Local~ are allocated to the UE for each access system (i.e. 2G/3G PS domain
and SAE/LTE network). The global IP address IP~Global~ shall be allocated as
well by the Inter-AS MM (e.g. HA when MIP is used as mobility protocol).
IP~local~ allocated by the 2G/3G PS domain shall be reported to the inter-AS
MM and used as the default query address (i.e.Care-of-Address for MIP) of the
UE. The UE may remain registered at SGSN and the SGSN at HSS. After this
registration with both 2G/3G and LTE system, the UE may change between 2G/3G
access and Evolved RAN without any more registration signalling.
Uplink data the UE may send out directly via 2G/3G PS domain or MME/UPE.
Downlink data shall be delivered by the inter-AS MM to the GGSN. Then the
2G/3G PS domain can send paging request to MME/UPE so that both SGSN and
MME/UPE can start paging. The paging response from the UE shall cause the
query address IP~Local~ binding updating to this entity, which receives this
paging response and shall send out data later.
### D.2.8.2 Information flow: registration and downlink data transfer
Figure D.10: message flow when UE selects 2G/3G access at first
0) The mechanism starts when the UE registers with the 2G/3G SGSN, e.g.
because of selecting 2G/3G access.
1) The UE attaches to the 2G/3G PS domain.
2) The 2G/3G SGSN registers at HSS and retrieves subscriber data, e.g.
authentication data.
3) In case of successful authentication/authorisation, SGSN accepts the UE
attachment.
4) The UE request the establishment of the default IP bearer service within
the 2G/3G PS domain if not already established. The local IP address IP~Local~
allocated by GGSN and the global IP address IP~Global~ allocated by inter-AS
MM shall be distributed to the UE as well.
5) IP~Local~ allocated by GGSN shall be binding to the inter-AS MM. It is FFS
whether this IP~Local~ Binding operation shall be carried out by the GGSN or
the UE itself.
6) The UE changes to the Evolved RAN.
7) The UE sends a registration request to the MME/UPE and sends old TMSI and
old RA assigned by the SGSN to identify itself.
8) The MME/UPE sends the UE parameters to SGSN.
9) The SGSN sends a UE context to MME/UPE. The UE context includes a permanent
user identity and other information, e.g. security and QoS information.
10) The MME/UPE confirms the registration and allocates new set of
TMSI/RA/IP~Local~ to the UE. The old set of TMSI/RA/IP~Local~ shall be kept by
the UE as well. The SGSN remains registered at HSS. Then the UE may change
between 2G/3G and LTE access without further network registration.
11) The UE may acknowledge the success of the network registration.
12) The incoming downlink data is forwarded by inter-AS MM to GGSN, and then
SGSN.
13) SGSN sends the paging request to MME/UPE.
14) Both SGSN and MME/UPE start paging the UE in their own RA/TA.
15a) In case the UE responds to the SGSN, SGSN sends data to the UE in step
17a).
16a) SGSN may send one indication to MME/UPE to stop paging (FFS).
15b) In case the UE responds to the MME/UPE, MME/UPE shall send out one paging
response indication to SGSN in step 16b).
17b) SGSN shall forward the received data to MME/UPE using 2G/3G existing
mechanism.
18b) MME/UPE delivers the data to UE.
19b) Another IP~local~ binding updating procedure shall be carried out by the
UE or MME/UPE(FFS.) .
20b) Subsequently the data shall be forwarded by inter-AS MM to MME/UPE, and
then UE.
It should be noted that it is the similar procedure for the case when UE
selects and registers SAE/LTE system at first.
It also should be noted that although \"data forwarding by SGSN\" is adopted
in the above figured D.10, it is FFS whether other mechanisms can be used
instead to deal with the data received before paging response is acknowledged.
### D.2.8.3 Advantages
1\. Allows Ues to be registered in Tracking Areas of E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN,
which reduces signalling for idle state Ues.
2\. Does not require Gr (MAP) at the SAE entities.
3\. Similar user-IP layer mobility management mechanism (e.g. MIP), which is
also used for between 3GPP and non-3GPP access system mobility management.
### D.2.8.4 Drawbacks
1\. Some modification of SGSN needed to support initiate paging request to
MME/UPE.
2\. Some potential limitations as subscriber control and registration with HSS
remains on SGSN and control on SAE entities is via bearer service control. The
specific limitations are FFS.
3\. Some modification of the SGSN (multiple TA in update confirmation, new
message to provide all subscription information to MME/UPE) needed to further
improve the amount of idle state signalling reduction.
4\. Some modification of the SGSN and RNC (signalling of transition to URA_PCH
to SAE entity) needed to further improve the amount of idle state signalling
reduction if URA_PCH is handled as an idle state.
## D.2.9 Combined MME/SGSN
### D.2.9.1 Architectural overview
This mechanism is based on the architecture where MME is separated from UPE
and where MME is co-localised with 2G/3G SGSN to reduce over the air
signalling between 2G/3G and SAE MME, avoiding unnecessary Mobility and
messages for Paging coordination. This will also result in a reduction in
signalling with the HSS.
This proposal is based on the concept of Equivalent RA and is also valid when
SAE UPE is separated from the Anchor.
{width="6.297916666666667in" height="3.214583333333333in"}
{width="6.303472222222222in" height="3.2180555555555554in"}
Figure D.11: Architecture overview
In this mechanism the UPE is in the data path of the packet data bearer
provided by the 2G/3G SGSN.
If the UE is under 2G/3G coverage, the UE registers with SGSN and receives
TMSI and RA and an Equivalent RA from SGSN. If the UE was under SAE coverage
and registered with the MME, it would have received the same TMSI and TA and
list of Equivalent RA from the MME. After the UE has completed it\'s
registration with the HSS via MME/SGSN during either the RA update procedure
or network attachment, the MME/SGSN includes the List of Equivalent RA (LERA)
in the confirm message to the UE.
When the UE registers with the Combined SGSN/MME the HSS is updated and a
default packet bearer is established between the Combined SGSN/MME and the
UPE/Anchor. The UE remains registered at the combined SGSN/MME until it
changes Pool Area.
After registering in one Domain, the UE may move between 2G/3G access and
Evolved RAN in IDLE mode without any signalling due to presence of same
Equivalent RA under the two Domains.
If the UE was last in 2G/3G SGSN coverage and a downlink data arrives in UPE,
DL PDU are duplicated and duplicates are forwarded to the Combined SGSN/MME.
If the UE was last in SAE coverage and a downlink data arrives in UPE, paging
request is sent to MME.
If the UE is in IDLE mode the Combined SGSN/MME initiates paging procedure:
MME sends paging to the eNodeB according to the TA of last known Equivalent
RA, SGSN sends paging to RA of Equivalent RA. If the SGSN receives the Paging
response, data is sent by that entity. If the paging response is received by
the MME, the MME establishes UP between Access node and UPE and data is
forwarded to Access node.
The paging response might be a Routing or Tracking area (if the UE had changed
access technology) and if so this proposal avoids new signalling to the HLR
which minimizes the time required to buffer the downlink packet which
triggered the paging.
### D.2.9.2 Downlink data flow to an \"inactive\" UE
When downlink packets are received at the UPE and the UE is in LTE-Active
state, a (virtual) connection between the UPE and the eNodeB may already exist
for the UE. If such a connection exists, the UPE sends the packets directly to
the eNodeB.
After the expiry of the LTE-Active State Timer in the eNodeB, the eNodeB will
inform the MME which will then remove the bearer connection between them
eNodeB and UPE. . No user plane transmission path between the eNodeB and UPE
exists for the UE.
When a downlink packet arrives the procedure described below applies:
1\. A LTE-capable UE performs a registration with the SGSN if under 2G/3G
coverage or with the MME if under SAE coverage.
2\. The SGSN/MME registers at HSS and retrieves subscriber data.
3\. In case of successful authentication/authorisation, the SGSN/MME accepts
the UE Registration.
4\. If the UE is under 2G/3G coverage, it activates a default PDP Context, the
SGSN interface with UPE to establish the bearer plane. If the UE is under SAE
coverage, default bearer is defined with UPE. The UPE knows in which combined
SGSN/MME node the UE camps.
5\. The UE moves to IDLE mode. SAE Default bearer is released if present. The
UE moves between access types (from 2G/3G to SAE or from SAE to 2G/3G) without
exchanging new signalling with the Network.
6\. Downlink data arrives at UPE
7\. If a tunnel exists with the SGSN, the UPE stores downlink packets and
forwards duplicates to the SGSN. If there is no Iu connection for the UE, SGSN
initiates paging in last known RA of the UE, else it forwards DL PDU to the
appropriate RNC. MME pages the UE in the last known TA of the UE.
8\. If there is no tunnel with the SGSN, the UPE stores downlink packets and
initiates a paging request with the combined SGSN/MME. The combined MME/SGSN
initiates 3G paging in last known RA and in last known TA (Equivalent RA).
9\. Paging takes place in the two Domains (2G/3G and SAE) in parallel. The UE
is paged on each of the E-UTRA, UTRA and 2G Cells that are contained within
the list of Equivalent RAIs allocated to the UE. If an Iu connection for this
UE exists in the SGSN, the SGSN forwards the packets to the RNC to allow it to
page the mobile and handle URA_PCH or CELL_PCH states.
10\. a) and b): When the UE receives the Paging message it responds with the
Service Request/Cell Update message (or E-UTRA equivalent) in the respective
domain.
11\. In case the UE responds to the SGSN, the SGSN sends data to the UE in
step 11a and MME paging can be stopped. In case the UE responds to the MME,
the bearer plane between eNodeB and UPE is established and the UPE forwards
the IP packet buffered for the UE to the eNodeB in step 11b and SGSN paging
can be stopped. If the UE changed access technology, the response will
probably be either a Routing/Tracking Area Update but there is no need for the
combined MME/SGSN to update the HLR, thus saving some signalling. In case the
UE was in URA-PCH state, UE response to paging is not visible from the MME,
MME paging shall be stopped based on a timer.
### D.2.9.3 Summary
It is believed that, the description given above in Annex D, clause D.2.x
shows that this mechanism can limit \"inactive mode signalling\".
Upgrades to existing equipment are avoided through combination of MME with
2G/3G SGSN.
### D.2.9.4 Advantages
1\. No signalling for coordination is needed between SGSN and MME.
2\. UE is paged by the SGSN and also in Equivalent RA by the MME allowing
reaching UE which have change access technology in URA-PCH state.
3\. Reduces user plane latency (paging in all access technologies occurs in
parallel).
4\. Reduction in session setup time when transitioning from IDLE to ACTIVE as
there is less interaction with the HLR.
5\. Limits IDLE mode signalling due identical Equivalent RA configuration.
6\. Allows overlapping tracking areas between E-UTRA / UTRA and GSM regardless
which tracking area concept is used in each technology, which reduces
signalling.
7\. It is possible to assign multiple tracking areas to the terminal, which
avoids hard tracking area borders also within each access.
8\. A unique interface with the HLR is needed.
9\. There is no new registration with the HLR during inter-access mobility.
### D.2.9.5 Drawbacks
Editor\'s Note: This list was prepared with respect to \"Solution A\" in
clause D.2.4.4.1.
1\. Requires addition of MME features with SGSN
# D.3 Information Flows
Note: all flows do not make any assumption on the collocation of entities, so
some cases where IASA is distinct from MME/UPE are shown as well as some cases
where it is collocated with it.
## D.3.1 Attach to SAE and RAT change to 2G/3G
Note: any assumption on the collocation of entities cannot be derived from
this figure. Implementations collocating IASA and MME/UPE are not excluded.
When the UE performs Attach or RA Update with the MME/UPE, it receives an
S-TMSI and an TA of the Evolved RAN. When the UE performs Attach or RA Update
with the SGSN it receives a TMSI and a RA of the 2G/3G RAN. The UE memorizes
these two pairs of identifiers.
After registration once with SGSN and once with MME/UPE, the UE may change
between 2G/3G access and Evolved RAN without any RA Update signalling as long
as it does not change the TA or RA and does not need to send/receive UL/DL
data.
When the UE moves between SGSN and MME in the allocated RA and TA, there is no
UE signalling with the Network, thus no signalling with the HLR.
The MM and PDP Contexts including security parameters are always kept up-to-
date on latest access (SGSN or MME/UPE) and transferred on demand to the
current access as described above. This keeps security consistent data for all
situations, e.g. also handover between 2G/3G and LTE. It is FFS whether during
such contexts transfer procedure, the current access node shall deliver some
Keep-context-indicator to make the previous access node keep the saved
contexts instead of removing them. It is FFS whether such MM and PDP contexts
include security contexts. Optimisations e.g. using a Context reference Number
are FFS. It is FFS whether periodic updates are considered as latest access.
To save some Authentication vectors and ensure the UE uses same authentication
vectors for MME and SGSN as both handles same PS bearers, authentication
vector can be exchanged between MME and SGSN (vectors used in the old MME can
be known in the new SGSN and vice-versa). It is FFS whether the UE should use
same authentication vectors for MME and SGSN.
It is FFS whether MME and SGSN are registered in parallel at the HSS, or
whether only one entity MME or SGSN is registered at a time at the HSS.
It is FFS whether and how periodic updates are used. It is FFS whether and how
the network detects that a UE is non-reachable (e.g. to stop paging for
downlink data) or when UE contexts can be deleted from MME or SGSN after long
period of inactivity.
## D.3.2 Attach to UMTS and RAT change to LTE
Note: any assumption on the collocation of entities cannot be derived from
this figure. Implementations collocating IASA and MME/UPE are not excluded.
Note: It is FFS in step 6) how to derive the address of the MME/UPE that was
allocated in step 56). It is FFS whether providing S-TMSI and S-TA to UE in
step 5) can be used.
When the UE performs Attach or RA Update with the MME/UPE, it receives an
S-TMSI and an TA of the Evolved RAN. When the UE performs Attach or RA Update
with the SGSN it receives a TMSI and a RA of the 2G/3G RAN. The UE memorizes
these two pairs of identifiers.
After registration once with SGSN and once with MME/UPE, the UE may change
between 2G/3G access and Evolved RAN without any RA Update signalling as long
as it does not change the TA or RA and does not need to send/receive UL/DL
data.
When the UE moves between SGSN and MME in the allocated RA and TA, there is no
UE signalling with the Network, thus no signalling with the HLR.
The MM and PDP Contexts including security parameters are always kept up-to-
date on latest access (SGSN or MME/UPE) and transferred on demand to the
current access as described above. This keeps security consistent data for all
situations, e.g. also handover between 2G/3G and LTE. It is FFS whether during
such contexts transfer procedure, the current access node shall deliver some
Keep-context-indicator to make the previous access node keep the saved
contexts instead of removing them. It is FFS whether such MM and PDP contexts
include security context depending on SA3 decision. Whether the serving
SGSN/MME should store all the up-to-date contexts both for SGSN and MME/UPE is
FFS. In case of some special contexts only for one access system, those
specific context may be only stored in one access system. It is FFS whether
periodic updates are considered as latest access.
It is FFS whether CRN (Context Reference Number), which inflects whether the
context is up-to-date in the access node) mechanism should be used to save
signalling between SGSN and MME. The SGSN should send SGSN Context Request to
MME only if the CRN sent by the UE mismatches with the one stored in SGSN.
To save some Authentication vectors and ensure the UE may uses same
authentication vectors for MME and SGSN as both handles same PS bearers,
authentication vector can be exchanged between MME and SGSN (vectors used in
the old MME can be known in the new SGSN and vice-versa).
Editor\'s Note: is re-use of vectors meant here? It is FFS if the UE should
use same authentication vectors for MME and SGSN.
It is FFS whether MME and SGSN are registered in parallel at the HSS, or
whether only one entity HSSMME or SGSN is registered at a time at the HSS.
It is FFS whether SGSN should send registration at the HSS after the step 14
due to no change of the SGSN.
It is FFS whether and how periodic updates are used. It is FFS whether and how
the network detects that a UE is non-reachable (e.g. to stop paging for
downlink data) or when UE contexts can be deleted from MME or SGSN after long
period of inactivity.
## D.3.3 Uplink Data Transfer
Note: any assumption on the collocation of entities cannot be derived from
this figure. Implementations separating IASA and MME/UPE are not excluded.
The information flow assumes that the UE has registered to both SAE network
and UMTS network for signalling free.
Note: For the uplink data on 3G, retrieving the latest context from the old
MME/UPE may increase the call setup latency. Optimisation is FFS for example
to move the step 2 3 4 5 after step 6bis then remove the RA procedure. Or,
steps 2,3,5 may be optional as only needed when latest access was on LTE or
CRN is mismatched if CRN mechanisms are applied.
The uplink data transfer on 3G may be optimised by starting immediately with a
Service Request instead of RAU Request, which is FFS.
Note: for the uplink data on LTE case, it is FFS whether the MME/UPE retrieves
UE contexts (step 2&3) in all cases or only when uplink data transfer is
initiated on another RAT than the UE used as the latest LTE access before or
CRN is mismatched if CRN mechanisms are applied.
For uplink data transfer, when the UE camps on Evolved RAN, the Service
Request triggers the MME to derive up-to-date PDP context and security
information from the old SGSN by means of the SGSN Context Request procedure.
For uplink data transfer, when the UE camps on 2G/3G the RAU Request triggers
the SGSN to derive up-to-date PDP context and security information from the
old MME/UPE by means of the SGSN Context Request procedure. The UE can then
initiate another NAS signalling as needed such as the Service Request re-
activate PDP Sessions. This establishes in addition a data path to the MME/UPE
and forwards data received from the UE to the MME/UPE.
## D.3.4 PMM-IDLE and URA-PCH state handling
Note: any assumption on the collocation of entities cannot be derived from
this figure. Implementations separating IASA and MME/UPE are not excluded.
Note: in steps 2, it is FFS whether existing SM messages can be used instead
of new messages.
Note: step 1b, 2b are dependent on whether URA_PCH state should be supported
for signalling free(see RP-050893 and report of RAN plenary #30). The
signalling load impacts of this mechanism are FFS. The interaction of this
approach with 2G Ready to Standby state transitions is FFS.
Note: how subsequent transitions from URA-PCH to other RRC connected substates
(and from GPRS standby to GPRS ready) are FFS.
Whether synchronous mode or asynchronous mode is used is FFS. The above figure
is synchronous mode.
_To reach UE, UPE would keep two flags to indicate the UE is active or idle in
E-UTRA and UTRA: one flag is "E-UTRA active or not" and another is "UTRA
active or not". If both of them are "idle", the UE would be paged in the both
RATs. If one of them is "active", the data would be sent to the RAN._
_The information "E-UTRA active or not" is easy to get by whether the tunnel
between the UPE and the ENB exists or not. But the information "UTRA active or
not" is not so easy to get. To page the UE correctly, there are several
mechanisms that can be used. The choice of mechanism is FFS. Two possible
mechanisms are ways to achieve it:_
_a) synchronous mode:_
_Whenever the UE turns to PMM_IDLE state, the SGSN informs MME/UPE; and
whenever the UE moves in URA_PCH state, the SRNC informs MME/UPE (via SGSN),
so that the UPE gets "UTRA active or not" as "idle" synchronously. When
downlink data arrive at the UPE, the MME/UPE starts paging in E-UTRA and the
MME/UPE requests the SGSN to page the UE if the UE's "UTRA active or not" and
"E-UTRA active or not" both are "idle". In case the UE responses in UTRA, the
UPE set "UTRA active or not" as "active"._
_b) asynchronous mode:_
_Although the UE moves in PMM_IDLE or URA_PCH state, the MME/UPE may not know
about it and the "UTRA active or not" is still "active". When downlink data
arrive at the UPE, the UPE send data to the SGSN. In case the UE is in
PMM_IDLE state, the SGSN pages the UE in UTRA and return copy data to the UPE
to indicate it to page the UE in E-UTRA. In case the UE is in URA_PCH state,
the SGSN send data to SRNC, and the SRNC return copy data to the UPE (via
SGSN) to indicate it to page the UE in E-UTRA. If the UE responses paging in
E-UTRA, "UTRA active or not" will be set "idle"._
## D.3.5 Downlink Data Transfer
NOTE: Any assumption on the collocation of entities cannot be derived from
this figure. Implementations separating IASA and MME/UPE are not excluded.
NOTE: In step ¼a, it is FFS whether the existing SM message can be used in
stead of a new message.
NOTE: Step 4a is dependent on whether exists only if it is agreed that URA_PCH
state should be supported for signalling free (see RP-050893 and report of RAN
plenary #30). The interaction of this approach with 2G Ready to Standby state
transitions is FFS.
This proposal implies RNC-MME/UPE signalling each time the UE changes to URA-
PCH state. This could be avoided if the UPE duplicates and sends duplicated
data to the SGSN when UE is in PMM-CONNECTED state. The RNC receiving DL data
while the UE is in URA-PCH should then signal the UE state to MME/UPE (via
SGSN) so that UPE stops sending data and starts parallel paging with MME.
When downlink data arrive at MME/UPE, the MME/UPE starts paging in the TA of
the Evolved RAN and the MME/UPE requests the SGSN to page the UE. The SGSN
paging is triggered by a MME/UPE message. (It is FFS whether further
enhancement is needed to allow the UPE to provide the SGSN with up-to-date PDP
context and security information at that stage). When the UE responds to the
MME/UPE, data are sent by the MME/UPE to the UE. When the UE responds to the
SGSN, the SGSN\'s response establishes the data path(s) between MME/UPE and
SGSN and data are sent by the MME/UPE via the SGSN to the UE.
## D.3.6 SGSN (respectively MME) change
If the UE arrives under a new SGSN (respectively MME), the new SGSN gets MM
and SM information from MME (respectively SGSN), like for an inter-SGSN RAU
procedure. In order to allow the new SGSN (respectively MME) to identify the
old node the UE was previously attached to, the UE provides a pair of access
type identifiers: 2G/3G identifiers (old TMSI and old S-TMSI), and SAE ones
(old RAI and old Tai), with an indication of the latest one. The new SGSN
(respectively MME) retrieves MM/SM context information from the latest node
the UE was attached to. It is FFS whether CRN mechanisms are used. In this
case the new SGSN retrieves MM/SM context information from the old SGSN and
may retrieve contexts from MME in case of the CRN mismatch.
The new SGSN (respectively MME) registers to the HLR.
Registration with the HSS allows subscription changes to be sent to the
current active node (SGSN or MME). ). It is FFS how for the new active node to
retrieve the changed subscription when the UE changes the RAT.
To save process time, it is FFS whether Cancel Location sent by the HLR should
not remove MM/SM information so that MME keeps UE context information when UE
is under SGSN coverage for further usage.
## D.3.7 re-authentication when UE camped within ERA
It is FFS whether and when the network triggers a standalone re-authentication
or whether re-authentication is combined with other procedures, e.g. with
periodic updates.
When MME (respectively SGSN) initiates re-authentication procedure, MME/UPE
(respectively SGSN) starts paging the UE in the TA (respectively RA) of the
Evolved RAN (respectively UTRA) and the MME/UPE (respectively SGSN) requests
the SGSN (respectively MME/UPE) to page the UE. The SGSN (respectively
MME/UPE) paging is triggered by a MME/UPE (respectively SGSN) message. The
access node which response the paging response shall carry out the mutual re-
authentication procedure with the UE, and exchange security information with
the other node to synchronize on the usage of Authentication vectors.
For the UE initiates re-authentication procedure, the current access node
shall carry out the mutual authentication with the UE, and exchange security
information with the other node to synchronize on the usage of Authentication
vectors.
# D.4 Potential mechanisms for context retrieval
This clause introduces several alternative mechanisms for context retrieval,
to be used as part of alternative potential solutions described in clause D.2.
## D.4.1 Fully synchronous mechanism
Fully synchronous mechanism means whenever MME/SGSN changes relative contexts
(MM/SM information), the MME/SGSN pushes them to the other registered node of
the UE (e.g. SGSN/MME). So before the UE accesses the network, both RATs nodes
have the latest information. There's no need for the access node to retrieve
the contexts during the UE\'s access procedure.
## D.4.2 MME as master, SGSN as slave
The MME always has the latest information, which means that the SGSN would
push the contexts to the MME when the SGSN updates the contexts as an access
node, but the MME won't push contexts to the SGSN when the MME updates the
contexts. And when the UE accesses LTE, the MME don't retrieve contexts from
the SGSN, while the SGSN retrieves contexts from the MME if the UE arrives
under 2G/3G.
## D.4.3 Coordination between MME and SGSN
_MME has up-to-date contexts when UE is under LTE coverage; SGSN has up-to-
date contexts when the UE is under 2G/3G coverage. The MME retrieves contexts
from the SGSN when the UE arrives under LTE coverage and the SGSN retrieves
contexts from the MME when the UE arrives under 2G/3G coverage. There is no
pushing contexts procedure compared with the above two approaches._
## D.4.4 Retrieval context from the last access node
When the UE arrives under a new node, the new node retrieves information from
previous node since the last access node always has the latest contexts. The
approach also doesn't need to push contexts. Compared with mechanism described
in D.4.3 (the coordination approach), there is no need to retrieve contexts
from other node in case the access node is the same as the node immediately
prior to the last access node. The approach needs the UE indicate the last
access information at access procedure.
## D.4.5 MME as master, SGSN as slave, plus CRN mechanism
Whenever the SGSN changes UE contexts, the CRN is updated in the SGSN and
synchronized to the MME and the UE. When the UE accesses 2G/3G, the UE sends
the CRN to the SGSN. Only if the SGSN detects the CRN mismatch, the SGSN will
pull the contexts from the MME. As a result, there is no need for the SGSN to
pull contexts from the MME if the SGSN already has the up-to-date contexts
(for example, the MME did not update the contexts or the UE continue to access
the SGSN)
## D.4.6 Coordination between MME and SGSN, plus CRN mechanism
If the contexts are changed, the SGSN updates the CRN and synchronizes it to
the UE. If the UE then accesses to the MME, it will send the CRN to the MME.
In case the MME detects the CRN mismatch the one stored in it for the UE, it
will pull contexts from the SGSN and update its CRN as the CRN the UE sent. In
case the CRN kept in the MME matches the CRN the UE sent, the MME doesn't need
to pull contexts from the SGSN. If the UE move from SAE network to 2G/3G
network the procedure is vice versa.
## D.4.7 Retrieval context from the last access node, plus CRN mechanism
The CRN mechanism is used like in the approach D.4.6. When the UE accesses the
2G/3G network, the UE indicates the CRN to the SGSN. In case the SGSN detects
the CRN mismatched, the SGSN will pull UE contexts from the MME. When the UE
move from 2G/3G network to SAE network, the context procedure is vice versa.
Because the CRN must match if the access node is the last access node, there's
no need to bring last access information. So, the approach could be converged
into approach D.4.6.
###### ### Annex E: Mobility between pre-SAE/LTE 3GPP and non 3GPP access
systems
# E.1 General
The intent of this Annex is to study architectural solutions for session
continuity and seamless mobility for 3GPP-WLAN Interworking in parallel to the
study of the evolved system. The goal is to develop a feasible architectural
solution for session continuity and seamless mobility for 3GPP-WLAN
Interworking, which allows evolution towards the SAE architecture for mobility
between access systems using 3GPP and non-3GPP radio.
# E.2 Description of mobility between pre-SAE/LTE 3GPP and non 3GPP access
systems
The term Access System is used here to designate one of the following:
\- The GPRS IP access (including both the PS core network and the RAN),
\- The WLAN 3GPP IP Access, or
\- The WLAN Direct IP Access.
Currently there is no standard means for ensuring session continuity or
seamless mobility between these two systems. Whenever the UE moves between the
two, any established session will fail and will have to be tunnelled. The
purpose of this clause is to study mobility solutions.
# E.3 Solutions for mobility between pre-SAE/LTE 3GPP and non 3GPP access
systems
## E.3.1 Solution A
This clause assumes that Mobile IP is used as mobility protocol for GPRS-WLAN
mobility, whereas MOBIKE [6] is used for Ue-PDG Ipsec tunnel relocation within
the WLAN 3GPP IP Access. It is assumed that the same solution applies for both
session continuity (a.k.a. Scenario 4) and seamless mobility (a.k.a. Scenario
5), depending on the mobile\'s capability for simultaneous connections.
Note that in the subsequent text we use the traditional MIP terminology i.e.
Mobile Node (MN), Foreign Agent (FA) and Home Agent (HA).
It is assumed that Home AAA in HPLMN is in charge of user authentication and
authorization.
Figure E.1 is a simplified figure describing how the Diameter application for
Mobile Ipv4, RFC 4004 [5], works in conjunction with the Mobile Ipv4 protocol.
Depicted is the case where Mobile Ipv4 is used with Foreign Agent Care-of
Address (FA-CoA). This requires a FA functionality within the Gateway (PDG or
GGSN). The names associated with some interfaces (e.g. Wm+, Wd+, Gi-aaa, Rha-
aaa, Gi+, Wi+) are clarified later in the text.
{width="6.652083333333334in" height="3.675in"}
Figure E.1: Use of MIPv4 FA care-of address mode with Diameter application
The following are the subsequent steps described in Figure E.1 (for more
details the reader may refer to RFC 4004 [5]):
1) The MN establishes a connection with the GW (i.e. GGSN or PDG);
2) The MIP Foreign Agent (MIP FA) function in the GW sends a FA advertisement;
3) The MN sends a MIPv4 Registration Request (RRQ);
4) The GW interrogates the user\'s Home AAA server in order to authenticate
and authorise the user. In the roaming case, the GW uses the Proxy AAA to
contact the user\'s Home AAA server. The Home AAA server assigns a Home Agent
(HA) and provides the address of the assigned HA to the GW.
5) The FA forwards the MIPv4 RRQ to the MIP HA.
6) The HA fetches a pre-shared key for MN-HA authentication. This step is
required only at session establishment. Specifically, it is not required for
MN-HA authentication when the UE subsequently connects to other Fas.
7-8) The HA accepts the mobile registration by replying with a MIPv4
Registration Response (RRP).
Figure E.2 is a simplified figure describing how the Diameter application for
Mobile Ipv4, RFC 4004 [5], works in conjunction with the Mobile Ipv4 protocol
when no FA present (co-located care-of address mode). The names associated
with some interfaces (e.g. Rha-aaa) are clarified later in the text.
Figure E.2: Use of MIPv4 collocated care-of address mode with Diameter
application when no FA is present
The following are the subsequent steps described in Figure E.2 (for more
details the reader may refer to RFC 4004 [5]):
1) The MN establishes a connection with a GW (e.g. GGSN or PDG) or is
otherwise assigned an IP address from an access network.
2) The MN sends a MIPv4 Registration Request (RRQ) to its HA transparently
through the GW. The HA IP address may be discovered e.g. using DNS resolution
of a HA FQDN, or through an agent advertisement, if the Home Agent is in the
same link as the MN.
3) The HA contacts the AAA server to fetch authentication and keying
information for the MN. This step is required at session establishment.
Specifically, it is not required for MN-HA authentication when the UE makes
subsequent registrations while the lifetime of the MN-HA keys is not due to
expire.
4) The HA accepts the mobile registration by replying with a MIPv4
Registration Response (RRP).
Depicted in Figure E.3 is a simplified view on how a Diameter application may
work in conjunction with MIPv6. The main difference wrt Ipv4 is the absence of
Foreign Agent in the GW.
{width="6.655555555555556in" height="2.8854166666666665in"}
Figure E.3: Use of MIPv6 with Diameter application
The following are the subsequent steps described in Figure E.3:
1) The MN establishes a connection with the GW and begins authentication;
2) The GW interrogates the user\'s Home AAA server in order to authenticate
and authorise the user. In the roaming case, the GW uses the Proxy AAA to
contact the user\'s Home AAA server. In addition, the Home AAA server provides
\"MIPv6 bootstrap\" information i.e. information allowing the Mobile IP client
in the UE to configure itself for MIPv6 service and identify the assigned HA;
3) The GW completes the user authentication;
4) The MN carries out a DHCPv6 procedure for MIPv6 bootstrap;
5-6) The MN sends a Binding Update (BU) to the MIPv6 HA (this is the
equivalent of the MIPv4 RRQ);
7) The HA authenticates the user and fetches keying material for subsequent
Binding Updates;
8-9) The HA accepts the mobile registration by replying with a Binding
Acknowledgement (BA).
The next two figures provide examples on how the MIPv4 and MIPv6 concepts
described above can be mapped to scenarios for GPRS-WLAN mobility. The red
pipes stand for Ipsec tunnels, whereas the blue pipes represent Mobile IP
tunnels.
Depicted in Figure E.4 is the application of Mobile Ipv4 as a solution for
GPRS-WLAN mobility. A FA functionality is incorporated in both the GGSN and
the PDG, meaning that in this case MIPv4 is used with Foreign Agent Care-of-
Address (FA-CoA). The Foreign Agent is not necessary for co-located mode
operation of Mobile IP (see Figure E.5).
The \"Home AAA\" functions which are required for the Diameter MIPv4
application are assumed to be provided by the 3GPP AAA server.
The MIPv4 tunnelling is used only on the Gi+ and Wi+ interfaces i.e. between
the HA and the FA located in the GGSN and the PDG, respectively.
Figure E.4: Use of MIPv4 with FA-CoA for GPRS-WLAN mobility
NOTE 1: In case the HA functionality is collocated with the GGSN, the terminal
can be considered to be at home in Mobile IP sense when using the GPRS IP
access. The FA functionality in the GGSN becomes redundant in this case.
NOTE 2: In case the GGSN and the PDG are attached to the same IP subnet, the
use of MIP is FFS.
NOTE 3: Whether the FA functionality has to be collocated with the GGSN/PDG or
whether it can exist as a stand-alone element is FFS.
The same architecture applies to both Scenario 4 and Scenario 5, the only
difference being that in Scenario 5 the UE is assumed to maintain simultaneous
connections across the source and target Access System during the transition
period.
Depicted in Figure E.5 is the application of Mobile Ipv6 as a solution for
inter-system mobility. The same figure also applies to the use of MIPv4 with
collocated Care-of-Addresses (co-CoA).
Figure E.5: Use of MIPv6 or MIPv4 with co-CoA for GPRS-WLAN mobility
In either case there is no notion of Foreign Agent in the GGSN or the PDG. MIP
tunnelling is used from the HA all the way down to the UE. In case of MIPv6,
the MIPv6 \"route optimisation\" mechanism is used to avoid tunnelling over
the radio.
Regarding inter-WLAN mobility, relying on Mobile IP alone may not be
sufficient for achieving Scenario 5-like seamless mobility. A possible issue
here is the time required for setting up a new Ipsec tunnel when changing the
point of WLAN attachment, because, contrary to the inter-system handover, the
UE may not be able to initiate a new Ipsec tunnel setup before breaking the
previous one. The IETF MOBIKE group is currently working on mechanisms for
speeding up this kind of Ipsec tunnel relocation. Figure E.6 clearly shows
that Mobile IP does not intervene during the relocation of the Ipsec tunnel.
MOBIKE would be used instead.
Figure E.6: MOBIKE use for inter-WLAN mobility
# E.4 Impact on the baseline CN architecture
## E.4.1 Solution A
Depicted in Figure E.7 is the baseline architecture taken from 23.882, from
which all IMS specific elements have been removed for simplicity. In addition,
a Mobile IP Home Agent (MIP HA) has been added to the figure, as well as a
couple of reference points. Listed below are all new or modified reference
points, with a description of their role:
**\- Gi+/Wi+** : this is the Mobile IP signalling and bearer plane between the
Gateway (i.e. GGSN or PDG) and the MIP HA;
**\- Wj** ; this is the Mobile IP signalling and bearer plane (tunnel) between
the UE and the MIP HA, which is used in case of MIPv4 co-located care-of
address and MIPv6;
**\- Gi-aaa** : this is the AAA part of the Gi interface, which traditionally
connects the GGSN to a AAA server which itself is not part of the 3GPP system
architecture. Here it is assumed that the Gi-aaa interface connects to the
3GPP AAA server. It is used by the Diameter Mobile IP application, RFC 4004
[5], for dynamic assignment of a MIP HA, as well as during setup of security
associations (MN-HA, MN-FA, FA-HA);
**\- Wm+/Wd+** : this is respectively an enhancement to the existing Wm and Wd
reference points. The additional functionality is similar to the Gi-aaa
functionality described above;
**\- Rha-aaa** : this is the reference point between the MIP HA and the 3GPP
AAA server. Similar to the previous, it is used for dynamic assignment of a
MIP HA and during setup of security associations.
The impact on the PCRF is left FFS.
The applicability to WLAN Direct IP Access is FFS.
Figure E.7: Impact of Mobile IP on the baseline architecture
# E.5 Impact on the baseline RAN architecture
None.
# E.6 Impact on terminals used in the existing architecture
## E.6.1 Solution A
In order to support GPRS-WLAN mobility with session continuity (i.e. Scenario
4), the terminal must have a Mobile IP client and a MOBIKE client. In order to
support seamless mobility (i.e. Scenario 5), the terminal must in addition be
capable of simultaneous connections.
Other impacts on the terminal are FFS.
###### ### Annex F: Policy related network Scenarios
# F.1 Scenario 1: Inter-system mobility within the home domain
As the user changes between two access systems, its serving MME/UPE may
change. All user plane traffic will pass the anchor node(s) in addition to the
serving MME/UPE. Depending on the grouping of functions (which is FFS), the
anchor nodes may be interpreted as MME/UPE, Inter-AS Anchor, or both.
For a single user, one PCRF node controls the anchor node(s), over an enhanced
Gx interface (Gx+). This means that when a user moves between 3GPP cellular
accesses and non-3GPP access such as I-WLAN, the PCRF will remain unchanged.
Policy enforcement (PEP) and charging functions (TPF) are in the anchor
node(s).
It is FFS whether policy enforcement functions are needed in the serving
MME/UPE.
NOTE: The single PEP assumption for this scenario may prevent the use of route
optimisation for traffic generated in the non-3GPP access system. Whether this
is an issue for the non-roaming case is FFS.
# F.2 Scenario 2: Roaming with home forwarding/tunnelling of traffic
In this scenario a user moves to an access operated by a different operator
than its home operator, i.e. the user is roaming. The access type used in the
visited domain may or may not be different from the access type used in the
home domain. Traffic is forwarded/tunnelled home from the MME/UPE in the
visited domain to the anchor node(s) in the home domain. Policy enforcement
(PEP) and charging functions (TPF) are in the anchor node(s).
Since the serving MME/UPE is in the visited domain, QoS support is needed in
the MME/UPE. The visited network operator may prefer not to allow another
business entity, i.e. the home operator, to have direct control over its
MME/UPE and set QoS and charging filters, since this would make it very
difficult for the visited operator to take responsibility for the management
of its own MME/UPE.
It is FFS whether a PCRF node is needed in the visited domain in order to
transfer dynamic AF session information to policy enforcement functions (PEP)
in the serving MME/UPE, when there already are both PEP and TPF in the home
domain anchor node(s).
If such a roaming interface is defined and used for the transfer of dynamic AF
session information (or some translation thereof) to the MME/UPE, it should
not make the AF mobility-aware, i.e., the AF should not need to be aware that
the user is roaming. This would add complexity into the AF, which is clearly
not desired. In addition, the interface should also allow the home network to
be involved in e.g. admission control decisions together with the transfer of
the AF session information (or some translation thereof).
If it will be decided that the existence of both PEP and TPF in the home
domain anchor node(s) is not enough to support the QoS in the visited domain,
it is FFS how to translate the dynamic AF session information so that a
roaming agreement between the visited and the home domains can be applied to
the QoS policies of the AF session in a consistent fashion.
The inter-system mobility in the visited domain may imply a PEP relocation.
How policy control works in conjunction with PEP relocation is FFS.
# F.3 Scenario 3: Static roaming agreement
This is a simplified scenario with limited capabilities. It does not provide
any PCC features, i.e. it does not use a PCRF to install dynamic policy or
charging rules. Such a simplified scenario might be used for e.g., plain best-
effort internet access. Basic policy and charging functionality, (e.g.,
measurement of the total amount of bytes transferred) could be pre-provisioned
or provided over a AAA interface between the home and the visited domains.
# F.4 Scenario 4: Roaming with route optimisation of traffic in the visited
domain, AF in the home domain
This scenario is similar to scenario 2, with the difference that traffic is
not forwarded/tunnelled to the home domain; instead it is routed optimally
between the visited domain and the peer node. The application function,
however, is still in the home domain; or alternatively it is outside the home
domain (e.g. at a third-party) but is connected to the PCRF in the home
domain.
The traffic passes through the visited network and not the home network, but
it should be under the control of the home operator. Bi-directional route
optimization is needed in most cases.
Due to the fact that no anchor node is involved in handling of the user plane
traffic in the home network, policy enforcement has to be implemented in the
visited domain. It is FFS whether PCRF nodes need to be involved in the home
and visited domains in order to transfer dynamic AF session information for
policy enforcement in the MME/UPE. It is FFS whether the roaming agreement
required between the home and the visited domains is feasible. In particular,
it is FFS how the roaming agreements for charging can be made simpler, e.g. if
charging is based on session signalling, and media is zero-charged.
The use of route optimisation may require updates to the PEP configuration
(e.g. if the bearer route can switch between optimised and non-optimised mode
during the lifetime of a session). How this is achieved is FFS.
# F.5 Scenario 5: Roaming with local breakout of traffic in the visited
domain, AF in the visited domain
In this scenario, the AF is in the visited domain, or at a third party but
connected directly to the visited PCRF. Bi-directional route optimization is
expected in this scenario. In this case policy control takes place fully in
the visited network, without direct signalling from the home network. The way
policy rules are provided by the PCRF in the visited domain has to be settled
in the roaming agreement with the home domain. It is FFS whether an increasing
reliance on the roaming agreement to provide control in the visited domain is
feasible, and what modifications would be needed to the roaming agreements.
In particular, it is FFS how charging is handled in the visited network.
It is FFS whether the home network AF takes part in the service provisioning.
# F.6 Scenario 6: Roaming with local breakout of some traffic in the visited
domain, forwarding/tunnelling other traffic to home network
This scenario is a combination of scenario 2 and scenario 4/5. For some
services, e.g. voice services and streaming services, local breakout for user
plane traffic has advantages in performance and bandwidth saving. However, for
other services, it is reasonable that the home operator would like to have
more control and forwarding/tunnelling is expected.
###### ### Annex G: Examples of Operator-Controlled Services
# G.1 Operator-Controlled Rx Services
An operator has a specific charging rate for user-user VoIP traffic over the
IMS. A PCC rule is established for this service data flow. The filter
information to identify the specific service data flow for the user-user
traffic is provided by the P‑CSCF.
An operator is implementing UICC based authentication mechanisms for HTTP
based services utilizing the GAA Framework as defined in TR 33.919 [11] by
e.g. using the Authentication Proxy. The Authentication Proxy may appear as an
AF and provide information to the PCRF for the purpose of selecting an
appropriate PCC Rule.
# G.2 Operator-Controlled Gx-only Services
A network server provides an FTP service. The FTP server supports both the
active (separate ports for control and data) and passive modes of operation. A
PCC rule is configured for the service data flows associated with the FTP
server for the user. The PCC rule uses a filter specification for the uplink
that identifies packets sent to port 20 or 21 of the IP address of the server,
and the origination information is wildcarded. In the downlink direction, the
filter specification identifies packets sent from port 20 or 21 of the IP
address of the server.
A network server provides a \"web\" service. A PCC rule is configured for the
service data flows associated with the HTTP server for the user. The PCC rule
uses a filter specification for the uplink that identifies packets sent to
port 80 of the IP address of the server, and the origination information is
wildcarded. In the downlink direction, the filter specification identifies
packets sent from port 80 of the IP address of the server.
The same server also provides a WAP service. The server has multiple IP
addresses, and the IP address of the WAP server is different from the IP
address of the web server. The PCC rule uses the same filter specification as
for the web server, except the IP address is different.
An operator offers a zero rating for network provided DNS service. A PCC rule
is established setting all DNS traffic to/from the operators DNS servers as
offline charged. The data flow filter identifies the DNS port number, and the
source/destination address within the subnet range allocated to the operators
network nodes.
For the IMS signalling traffic, a PCC rule may be configured, which includes a
charging key for zero rating and the authorised QoS parameters. The data flow
filter identifies the P-CSCF source/destination address within the subnet
range allocated to the IMS nodes.
###### ### Annex H: Signalling charts for combined or separated MME and UPE
This Annex presents information flows of SAE procedures that demonstrate on a
high level the differences between alternative function allocation to MME and
UPE and whether the MME and UPE are grouped or separated with an open
interface.
Editor's note: These information flows are work-in-progress and details and
principles need to be clarified for each alternative for performing the final
comparison and decision.
The information flows presented here only serve as illustrations of the
principal differences between the proposed alternatives to support the
comparison and selection of specific functional grouping and allocation of
functions to functional entities. The information flows need to provide
sufficient level of details to enable identification of main differences and
thereby identifying the questions that need to be answered. It is not intended
to develop the final information flows in this annex.
These draft information flows are shown for the following alternatives:
A. Combined MME/UPE.
B. Separate MME and UPE with control signalling mostly via the MME, and
session and context management in MME.
C. Separate MME and UPE with control signalling via the MME or the UPE, and
session and context management only in UPE.
For alternative A, the flows are adopted from the related key issue solution
descriptions of this document where the MME/UPE is shown as a combined entity.
Therefore they may lack details and may not be completely according to the
views of the companies supporting alternative A.
For alternative B and C is also the functional allocation shown.
The following non-exhaustive list of procedures are described, and other
procedures can be added later on:
  1. Attach including default bearer handling
  2. TA Update without MME or UPE change\ Note: Procedure has not been proposed for alternative A.
  3. Inter eNB Handover in LTE_ACTIVE mode (intra MME and intra UPE)\ Note: Various other procedures have been proposed where the MME and/or UPE are also relocated, but they are not shown here in order to simplify the discussions.
  4. Inter 3GPP Handover between pre-SAE/LTE and SAE/LTE accesses in LTE_ACTIVE mode\ Note: Procedures have not been proposed for alternatives B and C. Several procedures have been proposed for alternative A.
  5. Paging and Service Request
  6. Establishment of Dedicated Bearers\ Note: Only the main preferred signalling chart is shown for each alternative, although further procedures may also be supported.
  7. Inter MME and/or inter UPE change, including support for service continuity\ Note: This procedure addresses an architecture requirement.
  8. Authentication/ Re-Authentication
Lawful interception procedures may also be different for the different
alternatives, due to the need to coordinate between the MME and the UPE in
alternatives B and C. The details are FFS and are in the scope of the SA3 LI.
Note: The flows in this annex are mainly to show the differences between
alternatives and can be optimized further.
Editor's note: it is FFS in the following flows if IASA and UPE are collocated
or not.
Editor's note: Handovers are assumed to be Backward Handovers.
Editor's note: Data Forwarding as means to minimize loss of data is indicative
only. Other approaches may be used following agreed assumption in the future.

## H.1.2 Reference point impact from MME/UPE split
One new interface, S11, have been identified due to the MME/UPE split. S10
between MMEs is also identified, but is regarded as needed regardless of
MME/UPE split.
**S11 _: A new interface as a consequence of the MME-UPE split. Any MME-UPE
split would require this interface._**
# H.2 Attach including default bearer handling
Figure H.2.1: Alternative A
NOTE: Step 1 Attach request can involve indication of old temporary ID with
context request and response from old MME. Subscriber data transactions with
HSS can be combined with location update messages in steps 3 and 6. The
default bearer can be set up in IASA directly by the MME in steps 8 and 10
with update of UPE tunnel endpoint also provided by the MME. The NAS ciphering
algorithm can be negotiated during Authentication procedure, the UP ciphering
algorithm can be negotiated during bearer establishment procedure. The details
of the UP ciphering algorithm negotiation are FFS.

Editor\'s note: transfer of PCC information is FFS
1) The IP bearer service is established between the UE and the IASA via the
UPE1
2) The eNB1 decides to initiates a handover to eNB2
3) The eNB1 sends a Handover Required to the MME1.
4) The MME1 selects a MME2 serving the eNB2 the UE is going to use and sends
it a Handover Preparation Request, including the UE context information.
5) The MME2 creates a UE context and sends Handover Preparation Request to
UPE2. MME1 sends a Handover Preparation Request to the eNB2. The eNB2 sends a
Handover Preparation Confirm to the MME2. The bearer plane is established
between eNB2 and UPE2.
6) The MME2 sends a Handover Preparation Confirm to the MME1. MME1 informs
UPE1 of the relocation to UPE2.
7) Means to minimize lost of data i.e. UPE1 starts bi-casting to eNB1 and UPE2
or data forwarding to UPE2.

10) eNB2 sends a Handover Complete to the MME2. MME2 informs UPE2.
11) The UPE2 does a route update with the IASA.
12) UPE2 informs MME2 of the Handover Complete and the possibility to release
resources in previous access. MME2 informs MME1 which triggers UPE1 to sends
all downlink packets only to the UPE2.
13) The resource in the source system is released.

# H.9 Authentication/Re-Authentication
If MME/UPE split, it is the MME's role to negotiate and synchronize the keys
for AS, NAS and UP with UE by authentication procedure. And, the MME shall
deliver the keys for UP security to the related UPE during the IP bearer
establishment or after the MME and the UE renew the keys for UP security by
another authentication procedure. In short, after the MME challenges the UE by
performing an authentication, the MME shall deliver the renewed key for UP
security to the related UPEs.

###### ## Annex I: Open issues for the SAE architecture (Informative)
The followings capture the differences of major alternatives for the SAE
architecture, which are in line with the working assumptions agreed. Note that
'roaming' in this annex refers only roaming between SAE networks.
\- Separate the functionalities of 3GPP anchor and SAE anchor.
\- Alternative X
\- 3GPP anchor: Function that anchors the user plane for mobility between 3GPP
access systems, and includes GTP interface to SGSN in the GPRS Core. _[It
handles pre-LTE access bearers, by terminating the bearers or by associating
them with the user data traffic.]{.underline}_
_[(Note that the LTE access bearer termination and/or association with the
user data traffic is a UPE function, which is collocated with 3GPP
anchor.)]{.underline}_
\- SAE MM anchor: Function that anchors the user plane for mobility between
3GPP access systems and non-3GPP access systems. _[It also handles the
mobility for UPE/3GPP anchor relocation.]{.underline}_
\- SAE PDN gateway: Function for IP connectivity with PDNs/Service Domains (IP
address allocation for user data traffic, PCEF and LI for user plane traffic,
interfacing with the PCC and charging systems).
\- Alternative Y
\- 3GPP anchor: Function that anchors the user plane for mobility between 3GPP
access systems, and includes GTP interface to SGSN in the GPRS Core.
\- SAE MM anchor: Function that anchors the user plane for mobility between
3GPP access systems and non-3GPP access systems
\- SAE PDN gateway: Function for IP connectivity with PDNs/Service Domains (IP
address allocation for user data traffic, PCEF and LI for user plane traffic,
interfacing with the PCC and charging systems). _[It also handles 3GPP access
bearers, by terminating the bearers or by associating them with the user data
traffic.]{.underline}_
\- 3GPP anchor location
\- Alternative A
\- collocated with UPE:
\- SAE PDN gateway/SAE MM anchor can be collocated also by implementation.
\- Alternative B
\- For roaming case with home routed traffic: 3GPP anchor and UPE are
collocated in VPLMN, SAE PDN gateway is (SAE MM anchor if needed) in HPLMN.
\- For non-roaming case all in one.
\- Alternative C
\- 3GPP Anchor and UPE are collocated (when a 3GPP Anchor is needed); also
collocated with SAE PDN Gateway/SAE MM Anchor in non-roaming case
\- SAE MM anchor location for the roaming case with home routed traffic
\- Alternative 1
\- There is an SAE MM anchor in VPLMN
\- Alternative 2
\- An SAE MM anchor is only in HPLMN
