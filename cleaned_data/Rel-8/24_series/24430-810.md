# Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) was been produced by ETSI Technical
Committee Telecommunications and Internet converged Services and Protocols for
Advanced Networking (TISPAN) and originally published as ETSI ES 283 030 [10].
It was transferred to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in
December 2007.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the protocol details for the presence service
within the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based on the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) and SIP Events as defined in ES 283 003 [1].
Where possible the present document specifies the requirements for this
protocol by reference to specifications produced by the IETF within the scope
of SIP and SIP Events, either directly, or as modified by ES 283 003 [1].
The Presence XDMS and Resource List Server (RLS) specific data formats and
XCAP application usages are within the scope of the present document. These
are used within the context of the generic XDM capability described in\ TS 183
038 [2].
The present document is applicable to Application Servers (ASs) and User
Equipment (UE) providing presence functionality.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.

NOTE 1: Care must be taken when using the willingness PIDF element as it is
unclear as to the meaning of this for the various entities involved.\ Presence
service providers shall ensure that a single composition policy is presented
for individual presentities (e.g. such that where a presentity is supported by
multiple presence servers there is no change in the view seen by watchers).
NOTE 2: A specification of a suitable single composition policy is given in
OMA-TS-Presence_SIMPLE-V1_0 [4] subclauses 5.4.3. IETF is in the process of
developing guidelines for composition policies.
