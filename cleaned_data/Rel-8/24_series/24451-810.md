December 2007.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the ETSI TISPAN endorsement of the 3GPP TS
24.341 [1] \"Support of SMS over IP networks; Stage 3 (Release 7)\".

##### 5.3.2.5 Sending a notification about SM-over-IP receiver having memory
available {#sending-a-notification-about-sm-over-ip-receiver-having-memory-
available .H6}
When an SM-over-IP receiver wants to send a notification about UE having
memory available, the SM-over-IP receiver shall send a SIP MESSAGE request
with the following information:
a) the Request-URI, which shall contain the IP-SM-GW [address, if available.
and shall contain PSI of the SC, otherwise]{.underline};
NOTE 1: The address of the IP-SM-GW is received in the P-Asserted-Identity in
the SIP MESSAGE request that included the short message the UE could not
store.
b) the From header, which shall contain a public user identity of the SM-over-
IP receiver;
c) the To header, which shall contain the IP-SM-GW [address, if available, and
shall contain PSI of the SC, otherwise]{.underline};
d) the Content-Type header shall contain \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\"; and
e) the body of the request shall contain an RP-SMMA message, see 3GPP TS
24.011 [8], including the SMS headers and the SMS user information encoded as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [3].
NOTE 2: The SM-over-IP receiver will use content transfer encoding of type
\"binary\" for the encoding of the SMS in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
[NOTE 3: According to 3GPP TS 23.204 [5], the IP-SM-GW routes SIP MESSAGE
requests containing a notification of UE having memory available (containing
RP-SMMA as the body) towards the HSS and routes other SIP MESSAGE requests
(containing RP-DATA, RP-ACK or RP-ERROR as the body) towards SMS-
IWMSC.]{.underline}
