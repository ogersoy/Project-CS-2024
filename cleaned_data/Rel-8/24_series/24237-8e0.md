# 4 Overview of IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem Service
Continuity
## 4.1 General
In general, IMS Service Continuity provides the capability of continuing
ongoing communication sessions with multiple media across different access
networks. The main need for such continuity arises because user equipments
(UEs) with multimedia capabilities can move across a multiplicity of different
access networks.
The following procedures are provided within this document:
\- procedures for registration in IM CN subsystem are specified in clause 6;
\- procedures for call origination are specified in clause 7;
\- procedures for call termination are specified in clause 8;
\- procedures for PS-CS session continuity are specified in clause 9;
\- procedures for PS-PS session continuity are specified in clause 10;
\- procedures for PS-PS session continuity in conjunction with PS-CS session
continuity are specified in clause 11;
\- procedures for PS-CS session continuity for Single Radio are specified in
clause 12; and
\- procedures for media adding/deleting in clause 13.
For a UE or an AS not supporting ICS procedures, PS-CS service continuity
enables the transfer of a single full-duplex session with an active speech or
speech/video session media component.
## 4.2 Underlying network capabilities
### 4.2.1 General
SC assumes the use of a number of underlying network capabilities:
1) provision by the home network operator of SCC AS on the IM CN subsystem, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2];
2) if ICS is used, the network capabilities as specified in 3GPP TS 24.292
[4];
### 4.2.2 PS-CS session continuity, Single Radio
In order to allow for PS-CS session continuity, Single Radio, SR-VCC
procedures assume that filter criteria cause all sessions subject to SRVCC to
be anchored in an SCC AS as described in 3GPP TS 23.216 [15]).
Configuration of QoS assignment for SR-VCC as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [16]
and TS 23.107 [17] need to be aligned with the initial filter criteria and SCC
AS determination that a session is subject to SR-VCC as defined in 3GPP TS
23.216 [15]).
## 4.3 URI and address assignments
In order to support SC to a subscriber, the following URI and address
assignments are assumed:
a) in this version of the document, the SC UE will be configured with both a
static STI in accordance with subclause 5.11 in 3GPP TS 24.216 [5]; and a
static STN in accordance with subclause 5.12 in 3GPP TS 24.216 [5]. The static
STI is used by the SC UE to perform CS to PS session transfer when no
dynamically assigned STI is provided to the UE over the CS domain (e.g. when
the SC UE does not support ICS capabilities). The static STN is used by the SC
UE to perform PS to CS session transfer when no service control signalling
path as specified in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] is available.
b) the SC UE will be configured to be reachable in both the IM CN subsystem
and the CS domain by one or more public telecommunication numbers which should
be correlated between the CS domain and IM CN subsystem. Either:
\- this public telecommunication number can be the DN (e.g. MSISDN) used in
the CS domain and (in international form) comprise part of the implicit
registration set associated with that SC UE in the IM CN subsystem; or
\- the SCC AS can be configured to provide a functional relationship between
separate numbers providing each of these identities in the CS domain and the
IM CN subsystem, respectively.
# 5 Functional entities
## 5.1 Introduction
This clause associates the functional entities with the SC roles described in
the stage 2 architecture document (see 3GPP TS 23.237 [9]).
## 5.2 User Equipment (UE)
To be compliant with this document, a UE shall implement the role of a SC UE:
\- according to subclause 6.2 for registration of the UE in the IM CN
subsystem; and
\- dependent on the desired functionality, one or more of the procedures
according to subclause 6A.2, subclause 6.2, subclause 7.2, subclause 8.2,
subclause 9.2, subclause 10.2, subclause 11.2 and subclause 12.2.
## 5.3 Application Server (AS)
To be compliant with this document, an AS shall implement the role of:
1) an AS performing 3rd party call control acting as an routeing B2BUA as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]; and
2) an SCC AS as follows: dependent on the desired functionality, one or more
of the procedures according to according to subclause 6.3, subclause 7.3,
subclause 8.3, subclause 9.3, subclause 10.3, subclause 11.3 and subclause
12.3.
If the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request:
\- with either the Replaces header field (see IETF RFC 3891 [10]) or the
Target Dialog header field (see IETF RFC 4538 [11]), indicating a dialog
identifier of a session belonging to the subscribed user;
and the SCC AS does not support the procedures for performing PS to PS access
transfer specified in subclause 10.3, then the SCC AS shall send a SIP 403
(Forbidden) response to the SIP INVITE request, with a Reason header field
containing protocol \"SIP\" and reason-text set to \"PS to PS access transfer
not supported\".
The SCC AS also handles SDP media description conflicts according to subclause
6A.5.
# 6 Roles for registration in the IM CN subsystem
## 6.1 Introduction
A 3rd-party registration shall be performed via the ISC interface for the SCC
AS.
## 6.2 SC UE
Prior to performing IMS registration the SC UE if it supports ICS capabilities
shall check that IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled. An indication
that IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled or disabled can be found in
the ICS MO ICS_Capabilities_Enabled leaf node (see 3GPP TS 24.286 [13]).
The SC UE shall follow the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] for
registration of the UE in the IM CN subsystem.
If IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled then prior to making use of IMS
ICS procedures, the SC UE shall follow the procedures specified in 3GPP TS
24.292 [4] for registration of the ICS UE in the IM CN subsystem.
## 6.3 SCC AS
The SCC AS can obtain registration state information that it needs to
implement SCC specific requirements from:
a) any received third-party REGISTER request (e.g. including information
contained in the body of the third-party REGISTER request) as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [2];
b) any received reg event package as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]; or
c) the Sh interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.328 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.329 [7].
NOTE: Obtaining registration state information from HSS using Sh interface
does not allow the SCC AS to know the capabilities supported by the user
registered UE(s), including the used IP-CAN(s).
When the SCC AS receives a REGISTER request and obtains the registration state
information including an Correlation MSISDN using one of the above procedures,
the SCC AS shall determine if the REGISTER request is associated with ongoing
CS call by matching the Correlation MSISDN against the:
a) tel URI in the P-Asserted-Identity header field or associated with the
received IMRN when the SIP INVITE request was due to static STN, where the SIP
INVITE request was stored according to subclause 7.3.1; or
b) tel URI in the Request-URI when the SIP INVITE request was due to
processing unregistered filter criteria, where the SIP INVITE request was
stored according to subclause 7.3.1.
If the REGISTER request is associated with an ongoing call the contents of the
Contact header field in the REGISTER request shall be bound to the ongoing CS
call session identifier.
# 6A Roles for General Capabilities
## 6A.1 Introduction
This section describes the general roles for each functional entity as
specified
## 6A.2 UE roles
The SC UE may receive the operator policy via OMA Device Management, see 3GPP
TS 24.216 [5]. When the SC UE receives the operator policy, for each session
to be transferred, it shall take the operator policy into account when
deciding to perform the following:
\- selecting the access for initiating the transfer;
\- determining whether to transfer full or partial media during PS-PS
transfer; or
\- determining whether to add or remove media during the PS-PS transfer.
If the SC UE is configured with the operator policy (e.g. via OMA Device
Management as described in 3GPP TS 24.216 [5]) then, for each media or group
of media contained in the MediaorGroup node, the SC UE shall:
1) restrict originating sessions and session transfer towards the access
networks contained in the RestrictedAccessNetworkType node and;
2) consider the list of access networks contained in the
PreferredAccessNetworks node in the order of priority from the access networks
such that, when available, the highest priority access network can be used for
originating sessions and session transfer procedures;
3) if a new access network gets available- transfer media components to a
higher priority target network than the current access network based on the
value contained in the SC_media_transfer node value. If the SC_media_transfer
node value is:
\- \"shall\" the UE shall start a session transfer according to the home
operator\'s list of preferred access networks contained in the
PreferredAccessNetworks node;
\- \"should\" the UE is recommended to start session transfer according to the
home operator\'s list of preferred access networks contained in the
PreferredAccessNetworks node. The UE can evaluate if session transfer is
possible and desirable after having taken into account the Local Operating
Environment Information;
\- \"may\" the UE can decide whether or not to start session transfer in
accordance with user preferences if configured in the UE. The UE can evaluate
if session transfer is possible and desirable after having taken into account
the Local Operating Environment Information. If user preferences are not
configured, the UE can evaluate the home operator\'s list of preferred access
networks contained in the PreferredAccessNetworks node.
4) decide whether to keep or drop non transferable media components in the
case of partial session transfer based on the SC_non_transferrable_media node
value.
## 6A.5 SDP media description conflict between target and remote access leg
When the SCC AS receives an SDP offer on the target access leg, the SDP media
descriptions on the target access leg and the remote access leg, can be in
conflict. The way how the SCC AS resolves the conflict is implementation
dependent.
NOTE 1: Examples of conflicts are when, for a given media type, different IP
versions are used on each access leg, or when the same payload type number has
been assigned to different codecs on each access leg.
NOTE 2: An example on how to solve a conflict can be that transcoding
functionality is enabled by inserting an MRF. Another example is that 488 (Not
Acceptable Here) response is sent with the correct SDP media description.
# 7 Roles for call origination
## 7.1 Introduction
This clause specifies the procedures for call origination, both where the SC
UE is generating calls in the CS domain and where the SC UE is generating
calls using the IM CN subsystem. Procedures are specified for the SC UE and
the SCC AS.
## 7.2 SC UE
The SC UE shall support origination of multimedia sessions in the IM CN
subsystem as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
The SCC UE shall support origination of calls in the CS domain as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
If IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled then the procedures for call
origination where the SC UE is initiating calls using CS media are identical
to that for ICS UE specified in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4].
## 7.3 SCC AS
### 7.3.1 Distinction of requests sent to the SCC AS
The SCC AS needs to distinguish between the following initial SIP INVITE
requests to provide specific functionality relating to call origination:
\- SIP INVITE requests routed to the SCC AS over the ISC interface as a result
of processing filter criteria at the S-CSCF according to the origination
procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2], and therefore distinguished by
the URI relating to this particular filter criteria appearing in the topmost
entry in the Route header. In the procedures below, such requests are known as
\"SIP INVITE requests due to originating filter criteria\". It is assumed that
the SCC AS is the first AS that the S-CSCF forwards the request to after
receiving the request from the UE.
The SCC AS shall store the SIP INVITE requests due to static STN (as defined
in subclause 9.3.1) and the SIP INVITE requests due to originating filter
criteria, at least until their sessions are terminated.
Other SIP initial requests for a dialog, and requests for a SIP standalone
transaction can be dealt with in any manner conformant with 3GPP TS 24.229
[8].
### 7.3.2 Call origination procedures at the SCC AS
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to originating filter
criteria, the SCC AS shall follow the SCC AS roles for call origination
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4].
# 8 Roles for call termination
## 8.1 Introduction
This clause specifies the procedures for call termination, both where the SC
UE is receiving calls in the CS domain and where the SC UE is receiving calls
using the IM CN subsystem. Procedures are specified for the SC UE and the SCC
AS.
## 8.2 SC UE
An SC UE not supporting ICS or an SC UE supporting ICS with ICS capabilities
disabled shall support termination of multimedia sessions in the IM CN
subsystem as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] with the following clarification:
NOTE: An indication that an SC UE with ICS capabilities has its ICS
capabilities enabled or disabled can be found in the ICS MO
ICS_Capabilities_Enabled leaf node (see 3GPP TS 24.286 [23]).
1) If the SC UE receives a SIP INVITE request containing a SDP offer which
includes speech media component transported using an IP bearer, and:
a) if the SC UE sends the response to the SIP INVITE request over GERAN;
b) if the SC UE sends the response to the SIP INVITE request over E-UTRAN or
UTRAN, and the **IMSVoPS** indicator indicates that voice is not supported; or
c) if the SC UE sends the response to the SIP INVITE request over an access
network other than E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN and the access network does not
support the offered speech media component transported using an IP bearer;
then the SC UE shall send back a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response
without a message body.
The SC UE not supporting ICS or an SC UE supporting ICS with ICS capabilities
disabled shall support termination of calls in the CS domain as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
An SC UE that supports ICS with the ICS capabilities enabled shall follow the
call termination procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4].
## 8.3 SCC AS
### 8.3.1 Distinction of requests sent to the SCC AS
The SCC AS needs to distinguish between the following initial SIP INVITE
requests to provide specific functionality relating to call termination:
\- SIP INVITE requests routed to the SCC AS over the ISC interface as a result
of processing filter criteria at the S-CSCF according to the termination
procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2], and therefore distinguished by
the URI relating to this particular filter criteria appearing in the topmost
entry in the Route header. In the procedures below, such requests are known as
\"SIP INVITE requests due to terminating filter criteria\". It is assumed that
the SCC AS is the last AS that the S-CSCF forwards the request to.
Other SIP initial requests for a dialog, and requests for a SIP standalone
transaction can be dealt with in any manner conformant with 3GPP TS 24.229
[2].
### 8.3.2 Call termination procedures in the SCC AS
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to terminating filter
criteria, the SCC AS shall follow the SCC AS roles for call termination
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4].
# 9 Roles for PS-CS session continuity
## 9.1 Introduction
For a UE or an AS not supporting ICS procedures, PS-CS service continuity
enables transfer of single full-duplex session with active speech or
speech/video media component.
## 9.2 SC UE
### 9.2.1 SC UE procedures for PS to CS session continuity
If SC UE uses ICS capabilities, this subclause applies for IMS sessions that
contain only a single speech mediacomponent otherwise subclause 11.2.1.2
applies.
The SC UE may be engaged in one or more ongoing IMS sessions at the time of
initiating session continuity. By an ongoing IMS session, it is meant a
session for which the 2xx response for the initial SIP INVITE request to
establish this session has been sent or received.
If SC using ICS is enabled then if the SC UE is using Gm, then for each
sessionwith speech media component to be transferred and starting with theone
with active speech media component , the SC UE shall send a SIP INVITE request
to the SCC AS according to the ICS UE using Gm procedures for call origination
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4]. The SC UE shall populate the SIP INVITE
request as specified for PS-PS session continuity with full media transfer in
subclause 10.2.1 (including the STI of the dialog to be transferred) with the
following exceptions:
\- The SC UE shall indicate in the SIP INVITE request that the speech media
component is using CS bearer with its corresponding media description.
\- Upon receiving the PSI DN from the SCC AS, the SC UE shall follow the
procedures for call origination for ICS UE using Gm in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] to
set up the CS bearer.
If the SC UE is not using ICS capabilities, the SC UE shall:
a) if more than one full-duplex session with speech media component exists,
first initiate the release of all the ongoing full-duplex sessions with speech
media component except the session with active speech media component that was
most recently made active.
b) send, to the SCC AS, a CC SETUP message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8]
to set up a call over the CS domain. When sending CC SETUP, the SC UE shall
populate the CC SETUP as follows:
1) the called party BCD number information element set to the static STN; and
2) Type Of Number set to \"International\" and Numbering Plan Indicator set to
\"E.164\".in the Called Party BCD Number information element.
If the SC UE receives a release message to the CC SETUP message sent, then PS-
CS session continuity has not completed successfully and the call will
continue in the Source Access Leg.
### 9.2.2 SC UE procedures for CS to PS session continuity
The SC UE may be engaged in one or more ongoing sessions before performing
session continuity. By an ongoing session, it is meant a CS call for which the
CS call setup procedure is complete, e.g. CC CONNECT message has been sent or
received as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8] or a call for which the 2xx
response for the initial SIP INVITE request to establish this session has been
sent or received.
If not already IMS registered, the SC UE shall follow the procedures specified
in subclause 6.2 to perform IMS registration over the Target Access Leg before
performing CS to PS session continuity.
If IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled then if the original sessions
are established using ICS capabilities as defined in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4], then
for each session with speech media component to be transferred and starting
with the one with active speech media component, the SC UE shall send a SIP
INVITE request to the SCC AS in accordance with the UE procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [2]. The SC UE shall populate the SIP INVITE request as
specified for PS-PS session continuity with full media transfer in subclause
10.2.1.
If the original sessions are not established using ICS capabilities, subject
to the SC_non_transferrable_media node value in the Communication Continuity
MO (see subclause 5.27 in 3GPP TS 24.216 [5]) the SC UE shall:
a) if more than one full-duplex session with speech media component exists,
first initiate the release of all the ongoing sessions that are currently not
active with the UE procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.083 [YY] and then the SC
UE shall transfer the remaining ongoing full-duplex session with active speech
media component.
When transferring the active session, the SC UE shall send a SIP INVITE
request to the SCC AS in accordance with the UE procedures specified in 3GPP
TS 24.229 [2] . The SC UE shall populate the SIP INVITE request as follows:
1) the Request-URI set to the static STI; and
2) include in the Contact header field a public GRUU or temporary GRUU as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2], if a GRUU was received at registration.
If the SC UE receives any SIP 4xx -- 6xx response to the SIP INVITE request,
then session transfer has not occurred and the call will continue in the CS
domain.
When the SC UE receives a CS call release message, e.g. CC DISCONNECT message
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8], from the network, the SC UE shall comply
with network initiated call release procedures to release the CS bearer. When
CC_DISCONNECT message is received, the SC UE shall comply with the network
initiated call release procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
## 9.3 SCC AS
### 9.3.1 Distinction of requests sent to the SCC AS
The SCC AS needs to distinguish between the following initial SIP INVITE
requests to provide specific functionality relating to access transfer:
  * SIP INVITE requests routed to the SCC AS containing a STI belonging to the subscribed user in the Replaces header field or Target-Dialog header field. In the procedures below, such requests are known as \"SIP INVITE requests due to STI \".
  * SIP INVITE requests routed to the SCC AS containing a static STI in the Request-URI. In the procedures below, such requests are known as \"SIP INVITE requests due to static STI\".
  * SIP INVITE requests routed to the SCC AS containing either a static STN, a STN-SR or an IMRN (as described in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4]) in the Request-URI. In the procedures below, such requests are known as \"SIP INVITE requests due to static STN \".
NOTE: The media streams that need to be transferred are identified using
information described in the subsequent sections.
Other SIP initial requests for a dialog and requests for a SIP standalone
transaction can be dealt with in any manner conformant with 3GPP TS 24.229
[2].
### 9.3.2 SCC AS procedures for PS to CS session continuity
This subclause does not apply to reception of a SIP INVITE request due to STI
with CS media and other kind of media or without CS media.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to STI with CS media only on
the Target Access Leg, the SCC AS shall follow the procedures specified in
subclause 10.3.2. with the following exceptions:
\- As the SIP INVITE request includes an active speech media component using
CS bearer, then the SCC AS shall follow the procedures for SCC AS for service
control over Gm in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] to send the PSI DN to the SC UE and wait
for the SC UE to set up CS bearer before sending SIP re-INVITE request to the
remote end.
\- The SCC AS shall correlate the STI with the allocated PSI DN in order to
identify the remote leg to be updated.
When the SCC AS receives SIP INVITE request due to static STN, the SCC AS
shall associate the SIP INVITE request with an ongoing SIP dialog based on
information associated with the received IMRN (as described in 3GPP TS 24.292
[4]) or based on information from the SIP History-Info header field or
P-Asserted-Identity header field or Contact header field, and send a SIP re-
INVITE request towards the remote UE using the existing established dialog. By
an ongoing SIP dialog, it is meant a dialog for which a SIP 2xx response to
the initial SIP INVITE request has been sent or received. Multiple dialogs
associated with the same SCC UE may have been anchored when the SCC AS
receives a SIP INVITE request due to static STN. This can occur in the event
that the UE does not succeed in releasing all dialogs with inactive speech
media component. The identification of the associated dialog is subject to the
following conditions:
\- if only one SIP dialog exists for the user identified in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field and a SIP 2xx response has been sent and there is active
speech media component, then continue the session transfer;
\- if no SIP dialogs exist for the user identified in the P-Asserted-Identity
header field where there is active speech media component and a SIP 2xx
response has been sent, then send a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response
to reject the SIP INVITE request relating to the session transfer;
\- if more than one SIP dialog exists for the user identified in the
P-Asserted-Identity header field for which SIP 2xx responses have been sent
and there is active speech media component on each of them, then the SCC AS
shall perform session transfer procedures for the dialog that originates from
the same device that initiated the received SIP INVITE request due to static
STN. If more than one such dialogs exists from the same device, the SCC AS
shall proceed with the next step in this list; and
NOTE 1: Whether the dialog originates from the same UE as the received SIP
INVITE request is determined based on local information and information
related to the correlation MSISDN or the Instance-ID of the originating user
as determined via registration procedures as defined in subclause 6.3.
\- if more than one SIP dialog exists for the user identified in the
P-Asserted-Identity header field and exactly one dialog exists where there is
active speech media component and a SIP 2xx response has been sent for that
dialog, then:
\- if the remaining dialogs have inactive speech media component, then the SCC
AS may release the dialogs with inactive speech media component and continue
the session transfer procedures; or
\- if the SCC AS is not able to identify one dialog for session transfer, then
the SCC AS shall send a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to reject
the SIP INVITE request relating to the session transfer.
\- if more than one SIP dialog with active speech media component exist for
the user identified in the P-Asserted-Identity header field and a SIP 2xx
response has been sent for that dialog, then:
\- the SCC AS may release all SIP dialogs with speech media component of the
user identified in the P-Asserted-Identity header field for which a SIP 2xx
response has been sent except the dialog with the active speech media
component that was most recently made active and continue the session transfer
procedures; or
\- if the SCC AS is not able to identify one dialog for session transfer, then
the SCC AS shall send a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to reject
the SIP INVITE request relating to the session transfer.
Continuing the session transfer procedures, the SCC AS shall populate the SIP
re-INVITE request as follows:
1) set the Request-URI to the URI contained in the Contact header field
returned at the creation of the dialog with the remote UE; and
2) a new SDP offer, including the media characteristics as received in the SIP
INVITE request due to static STN, by following the rules of 3GPP TS 24.229
[2].
Upon receiving the SIP ACK request from the IM CN subsystem, then:
\- if the source access leg contains only one speech media component the SCC
AS shall initiate release of the source access leg by sending a SIP BYE
request toward the S-CSCF for sending to the served SCC UE; or
\- If the Source Access Leg contains media components other than speech media
component, the SCC AS should send a re-INVITE request to update the source
access leg.
### 9.3.3 SCC AS procedures for CS to PS session continuity
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to STI on the Target Access
Leg offering PS media only, the SCC AS shall follow the procedures specified
in subclause 10.3.2.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to static STI, the SCC AS
shall associate the SIP INVITE request with an ongoing SIP dialog. By an
ongoing SIP dialog, it is meant a dialog for which a SIP 2xx response to the
initial SIP INVITE request has been sent or received. Multiple dialogs
associated with the same SCC UE may have been anchored when the SCC AS
receives a SIP INVITE request due to static STI. This can occur in the event
that the UE does not succeed in releasing all dialogs with inactive speech
media component, in which case the identification of the associated dialog is
subject to the following conditions:
\- if only one SIP dialog exists for the user identified in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field and a 2xx response has been sent and there is active
speech media component, then continue the session transfer procedures;
\- if no SIP dialogs exist for the user identified in the P-Asserted-Identity
header field where there is active speech media component and a SIP 2xx
response has been sent, then send a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response
to reject the SIP INVITE request relating to the session transfer;
\- if more than one SIP dialog exists for the user identified in the
P-Asserted-Identity header field and exactly one dialog exists where there is
active speech media component and a SIP 2xx response has been sent for that
dialog, then:
\- if the remaining dialogs have inactive speech media component, then the SCC
AS may release the dialogs with inactive speech media component and continue
the session transfer procedures; or
\- if the SCC AS is not able to identify one dialog for session transfer, then
the SCC AS shall send a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to reject
the SIP INVITE request relating to the session transfer.
Continuing the session transfer procedures, the SCC AS sends a SIP re-INVITE
request towards the remote UE using the existing established dialog. The SCC
AS shall populate the SIP re-INVITE request as follows:
1) set the Request-URI to the URI contained in the Contact header field
returned at the creation of the dialog with the remote UE; and
2) a new SDP offer, including the media characteristics as received in the SIP
INVITE request due to the static STI, by following the rules of 3GPP TS 24.229
[2].
Upon receiving the SIP ACK request originated from the UE, the SCC AS shall
initiate release of the source access leg by sending a SIP BYE request over
the source access leg.
If, subsequent to initiating the SIP re-INVITE request to the remote UE, and
prior to the SIP ACK request originated from the UE being received from the IM
CN subsystem for the source access leg, the SCC AS decides (for any reason) to
reject the session transfer request back to the UE (e.g. by sending a 4xx
response), the SCC AS shall release the target access leg and maintain the
source access leg.
# 10 Roles for PS-PS session continuity
## 10.1 Introduction
This clause specifies the procedures for PS-PS session continuity for both
full media transfer case and partial media transfer case. Procedures are
specified for the SC UE and the SCC AS.
## 10.2 SC UE
### 10.2.0 General
The SC UE may be engaged in one or more ongoing sessions before performing
session continuity. By an ongoing session, it is meant a session for which the
SIP 2xx response for the initial SIP INVITE request to establish this session
has been sent or received.
The SC UE shall follow the procedures specified in subclause 6.2 to perform
IMS registration over the Target Access Leg before performing PS-PS session
continuity.
### 10.2.1 Full session transfer
To initiate PS-PS session continuity for a session, the SC UE shall send a SIP
INVITE request over the Target Access Leg in accordance with UE procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]. The SC UE shall populate the SIP INVITE
request as follows:
1\. the Request-URI set to the URI contained in the Contact header field
returned at the creation of the dialog over the Source Access Leg;
2\. include in the Contact header field:
A a public GRUU or temporary GRUU as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] if a GRUU
was received at registration; and
B the media feature tag g.3gpp.ics set to \"principal\" as specified in annex
B of 3GPP TS 24.292 [4];
3\. select one of the following options:
A. if usage of SIP Replaces extension is selected:
a. the Replaces header field populated as specified in IETF RFC 3891 [10],
containing the dialog identifier of the session to be transferred; and
b. the Require header field populated with the option tag value \"replaces\";
B. if usage of SIP Target-Dialog extension is selected:
a. the Target-Dialog header field populated as specified in IETF RFC 4538
[11], containing the dialog identifier of the session to be transferred; and
b. the Require header field populated with the option tag value \"tdialog\";
and
4\. the SDP payload set for the media component(s) to be transferred, in
accordance with the UE SDP origination procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[2]. The SDP shall contain the same number of media lines, each corresponding
to one of the media components in the original session, unless media
components need to be added and such that:
A. each media line shall indicate the same media type as its corresponding
media component in the original session and shall contain at least one codec
that was negotiated during the original session;
B. all or a subset of payload type numbers and their mapping to codecs and
media parameters are not conflicting with those negotiated in the original
session; and
C. if the SC UE determines to:
a. remove a media component during the transfer, then the media line for this
media component shall include a port number with value zero; and
b. add new media component(s) during the transfer, then one additional media
line with the desired media type and codecs shall be added for each new media
component at the end of the SDP.
NOTE: If an SC UE is an ICS UE with an ongoing session using CS bearer and Gm
reference point for service control signalling, the SC UE can perform an
access transfer of the service control signalling from the current IP-CAN to a
new IP‑CAN with the same capabilities (i.e. supporting CS and PS bearers,
simultanously) while retaining the media component in the CS access network,
so that service continuity of the session is maintained.
Upon receiving SIP 2xx response for the SIP INVITE request sent over the
Target Access Leg and sending SIP ACK request, if the dialog over the Source
Access Leg is still active, the SC UE shall send a SIP BYE request to the SCC
AS over the Source Access Leg to terminate the original session.
If the SC UE receives any SIP 4xx -- 6xx response to the SIP INVITE request
sent over the Target Access Leg, then PS-PS session continuity has not
completed successfully and the call will continue in the Source Access Leg.
### 10.2.2 Partial session transfer
To initiate PS-PS session continuity for a session, the SC UE shall send a SIP
INVITE request over the Target Access Leg in accordance with UE procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]. The SC UE shall populate the SIP INVITE
request as follows:
1\. the Request-URI set to the URI contained in the Contact header field
returned at the creation of the dialog over the Source Access Leg;
2\. include in the Contact header field:
A. a public GRUU or temporary GRUU as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] if a
GRUU was received at registration; and
B. the media feature tag g.3gpp.ics set to \"principal\" as specified in annex
B of 3GPP TS 24.292 [4];
3\. the Require header with the option tag "tdialog" included;
4\. the Target-Dialog header populated as specified in IETF RFC 4538 [11],
containing the dialog identifier of the session to be transferred; and
5\. the SDP payload set for the media component(s) to be transferred, in
accordance with the UE SDP origination procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[2]. The SDP shall contain the same number of media lines in the same order,
each corresponding to one of the media components in the original session,
unless media components need to be added during the session transfer and such
that:
A. each media line shall indicate the same media type as its corresponding
media component in the original session and shall contain at least one codec
that was negotiated during the original session;
B. all or a subset of payload type numbers and their mapping to codecs and
media parameters are not conflicting with those negotiated in the original
session; and
C. if the SC UE determines to:
a. If the SC UE determines to keep the media component on the Source Access
Leg, then the media line for this media component shall include a port number
with value zero; and
b. If the SC UE determines to add new media component(s) during the transfer,
then one additional media line with the desired media type and codecs shall be
added for each new media component at the end of the SDP.
NOTE: If an SC UE is an ICS UE with an ongoing session using CS bearer and Gm
reference point for service control signalling, the SC UE can perform an
access transfer of the service control signalling from the current IP-CAN to a
new IP‑CAN with the same capabilities (i.e. supporting CS and PS bearers,
simultanously) while retaining the media component in the CS access network,
so that service continuity of the session is maintained.
Upon receiving SIP 2xx response for the SIP INVITE request sent over the
Target Access Leg and sending SIP ACK request, the SC UE shall send a SIP re-
INVITE request to the SCC AS over the Source Access Leg to update the original
session. The SC UE shall populate the SIP re-INVITE request as follows:
1\. the SDP payload set for all the media component(s) within the original
session, in accordance with the UE SDP origination procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [2]. The port number for a media component shall be set to zero
if that media component has been transferred to the Target Access Leg or has
to be removed.
If the SC UE receives any SIP 4xx -- 6xx response to the SIP INVITE request
sent over the Target Access Leg, then PS-PS session continuity has not
completed successfully and the call will continue in the Source Access Leg.
## 10.3 SCC AS
### 10.3.1 Distinction of requests sent to the SCC AS
The SCC AS needs to distinguish between the following initial SIP INVITE
requests to provide specific functionality relating to access transfer:
  * SIP INVITE requests routed to the SCC AS containing a STI belonging to the subscribed user in the Replaces header or Target-Dialog header. In the procedures below such requests are known as \"SIP INVITE requests due to STI \".
NOTE: The media streams that need to be transferred are identified using
information described in the subsequent sections.
Other SIP initial requests for a dialog and requests for a SIP standalone
transaction can be dealt with in any manner conformant with 3GPP TS 24.229
[2].
### 10.3.2 PS to PS Session Continuity Procedures at the SCC AS
This subclause applies to reception of a SIP INVITE request due to STI with a
PS media only.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request on the Target Access Leg due to
STI, the SCC AS shall:
  * associate the SIP INVITE received on the Target Access Leg with an ongoing SIP dialog i.e. identify the Source Access Leg. The Source Access Leg is identified by matching the dialog ID present in the Replaces (see IETF RFC 3891 [10]) or Target Dialog header (see IETF RFC 4538 [11]) of the SIP INVITE with an ongoing dialog. By an ongoing SIP dialog, it is meant a dialog for which a SIP 2xx response to the initial SIP INVITE request has been sent or received;
  * if the SCC AS is unable to associate the SIP INVITE with a unique ongoing dialog, send a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to reject the SIP INVITE request relating to the access transfer and not processes the remaining steps;
  * if the SIP INVITE request contains a Replaces header:
a) follow the procedures defined in IETF RFC 3891 [10] for replacing the
Source Access Leg with the SIP request received on the Target Access Leg,
including terminating the Source Access Leg by sending a SIP BYE towards the
SC UE in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [8]; and
b) send a SIP re-INVITE request towards the remote UE using the existing
established dialog. The SCC AS shall populate the SIP re-INVITE request as
follows:
1) set the Request-URI to the URI contained in the Contact header field
returned at the creation of the dialog with the remote UE; and
2) a new SDP offer, including the media characteristics as received in the SIP
INVITE request due to STI received on the Target Access Leg, by following the
rules of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
\- otherwise, if the SIP INVITE request contains a Target Dialog header:
a) if the number of media lines in the Target Access Leg is less than the
number of media lines in the Source Access Leg or the media type for the
corresponding media lines is not the same as in the original session, send a
SIP 4xx response to reject the SIP INVITE request relating to the access
transfer and not process the remaining steps;
b) otherwise, send a SIP re-INVITE request towards the remote UE using the
existing established dialog. The SCC AS shall populate the SIP re-INVITE
request as follows:
1) set the Request-URI to the URI contained in the Contact header field
returned at the creation of the dialog with the remote UE; and
2) include a new SDP offer, following the rules specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[2], containing the following media information:
\- the media characteristics as received in the SIP INVITE request due to STI
received on the Target Access Leg for media streams whose port is not set to
zero; and
\- for the media streams in the SIP INVITE request due to STI whose port is
set to zero, include the corresponding media characteristics of those streams
from the Source Access Leg,
c) for a full media transfer, send a SIP BYE towards the SC UE in accordance
with 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]; otherwise, for a partial media transfer, after
receiving the SIP ACK request from the SC UE on the Target Access Leg, upon
receiving an update (e.g. SIP re-INVITE) from the SC UE on the Source Access
Leg, process the update request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
If, subsequent to initiating the SIP re-INVITE request to the remote UE, and
prior to the SIP ACK request being received on the Target Access Leg, the SCC
AS decides (for any reason) to reject the access transfer request (e.g. by
sending a 4xx response), the SCC AS shall release the Target Access Leg,
retain the Source Access Leg, and update the remote leg to match the Source
Access Leg.
# 11 Roles for PS-PS session continuity in conjunction with PS-CS session
continuity
## 11.1 Introduction
This clause specifies the procedures for PS-PS session continuity in
conjunction with PS-CS session continuity. Procedures are specified for the SC
UE and the SCC AS. For SC UE or SCC AS not supporting ICS procedures, PS-PS
session continuity with a remote end in conjunction with PS-CS session
continuity with the same remote end is only possible when the UE is active in
a single CS call with the remote end i.e. support of session transfer with
more than one CS call is not provided.
## 11.2 SC UE
### 11.2.1 SC UE procedures for PS to PS+CS session continuity
#### 11.2.1.1 General
The SC UE may be engaged in one or more ongoing IMS sessions before performing
session continuity. By an ongoing session, it is meant a session for which the
SIP 2xx response for the initial SIP INVITE request to establish this session
has been sent or received.
#### 11.2.1.2 SC UE procedures for PS to PS+CS session continuity using ICS
This subclause applies for IMS sessions that contain only a single speech
media component, otherwise subclause 9.2.1 applies.
If IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled then if the SC UE is using Gm,
then for each session with speech media component to be transferred and
starting with the full-duplex session with active speech media component, the
SC UE shall send a SIP INVITE request to the SCC AS as specified for call
origination for ICS UE using Gm in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4]. The SC UE shall
populate the SIP INVITE request as specified for PS-PS session continuity with
full media transfer in subclause 10.2.1 with the following exceptions:
\- The SC UE shall indicate in the SIP INVITE request that the speech media
component is using CS bearer with its corresponding media description.
\- When sending the SIP INVITE request for the sessions with inactive speech
media component and if precondition is used, the SC UE shall indicate that the
related local preconditions for the speech media component are met.
For the full-duplex session with active speech media component, upon receiving
the PSI DN from the SCC AS, the SC UE shall follow the procedures for call
origination for ICS UE using Gm in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] to set up the CS bearer.
If service control over Gm for the CS bearer is retained on the source access
leg, the SC UE shall:
\- send an SIP INVITE request as specified for partial session transfer in
subclause 10.2.2. indicating transfer of non-speech media to the target access
leg; and
\- send a SIP re-INVITE request over the source access leg indicating that the
speech media component is to be transferred to a CS bearer as described in
3GPP TS 24.292 [4] subclause 8.2.2.2. If other media components are retained
or added on the source access leg, then these are included in the SDP offer.
For the full-duplex session with active speech media component, upon receiving
the SCC AS PSI DN from the SCC AS, the SC UE shall follow the procedures for
call origination for ICS UE using Gm in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] to set up the CS
bearer.
#### 11.2.1.3 SC UE procedures for PS to PS+CS session continuity not using
ICS
If the SC UE is not using ICS capabilities, then session continuity is only
possible when the UE has a single full-duplex session with active speech media
component. For the non-speech components to be transferred to the PS Target
Access Leg, the SC UE shall send a SIP INVITE request to the SCC AS as
specified for PS-PS session continuity with partial media transfer in
subclause 10.2.1. For the speech media component to be transferred to the CS
Target Access leg, the SC UE shall send to the SCC AS a CC SETUP message as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8]. When sending the CC SETUP message, the SC UE
shall populate the CC SETUP message as follows:
1) the called party BCD number information element set to the STN;
2) Type Of Number set to \"International\" and Numbering Plan Indicator set to
\"E.164\".in the Called Party BCD Number information element.
Upon receiving the SIP 2xx response from the SCC AS for the PS Target Access
Leg and sending SIP ACK request and upon receiving CS call setup confirmation
message, e.g. CC CONNECT message, for the CS Target Access Leg, the SC UE
shall send a SIP BYE request to terminate the Source Access Leg, following the
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
If the SC UE receives any SIP 4xx -- 6xx response to the SIP INVITE request
for the PS Target Access leg and receives CS call setup failure message for
the CS Target Access Leg, then session transfer has not occurred and the call
will continue in the original domains.
If the SC UE receives any SIP 4xx -- 6xx response to the SIP INVITE request
for the PS Target Access Leg and receives CS call setup confirmation message
for the CS Target Access Leg, then the session transfer is only successful for
part of the media components. The SC UE shall update the Source Access leg by
following the procedures specified for PS-PS session continuity with partial
media transfer in subclause 10.2.2 to indicate that all media components other
than the speech media component are still maintained on the Source Access Leg.
If the SC UE receives CS call setup failure message for the CS Target Access
Leg but receives a SIP 2xx response for the PS Target Access Leg, then the
session transfer is only successful for part of the media components. Upon
sending SIP ACK request, the SC UE shall update the Source Access leg by
following the procedures specified for PS-PS session continuity with partial
media transfer in subclause 10.2.2 to indicate that the speech media component
is still maintained on the Source Access Leg.
### 11.2.2 SC UE procedures for PS+CS to PS session continuity
#### 11.2.2.1 General
The SC UE may be engaged in one or more ongoing sessions before performing
session continuity. By an ongoing session, it is meant a CS call for which the
CC CONNECT message has been sent or received or a call for which the SIP 2xx
response for the initial SIP INVITE request to establish this session has been
sent or received.
If not already registered over the PS Target Access Leg, the SC UE shall
follow the procedures specified in subclause 6.2 to perform IM CN subsystem
registration over the Target Access Leg before performing PS/CS to PS session
continuity.
#### 11.2.2.2 SC UE procedures for PS+CS to PS session continuity using ICS
If IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled then if the original sessions
are established using ICS capabilities, then for each session with speech
media component to be transferred and starting with the full-duplex session
with active speech media component, the SC UE shall send a SIP INVITE request
to the SCC AS in accordance with the UE procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[2]. The SC UE shall populate the SIP INVITE request as specified for PS-PS
session continuity with full media transfer in subclause 10.2.1. The SC UE
shall indicate in the SIP INVITE request that the speech media component is
using PS media.
Upon receiving SIP BYE request for the Source Access Leg, the SC UE shall
follow the ICS using Gm procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] to release
the session. The SC UE also releases the associated CS bearer if no other
sessions depend on the CS bearer.
#### 11.2.2.3 SC UE procedures for PS+CS to PS session continuity not using
ICS
If the original sessions are not established using ICS capabilities, then
session continuity is only possible when the SC UE has a single session with
active full-duplex speech media component. The SC UE shall send a SIP INVITE
request to the SCC AS in accordance with the UE procedures specified in 3GPP
TS 24.229 [2] .
The SC UE shall populate the SIP INVITE request as follows:
\- the Request-URI set to static STI;
\- the Require header field including \"replaces\" option tag;
\- the Replaces header field populated as specified in IETF RFC 3891 [10],
containing the dialog identifier of the session to be transferred on the PS
Source Access Leg; and
\- the SDP payload set for the media component(s) to be transferred, in
accordance the UE SDP origination procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
The SDP shall contain media components in the following order:
1) The same number of media lines, each corresponding to one of the media
components in the session on the PS Source Access Leg; Each media line shall
indicate the same media type as its corresponding media component in the
original session and shall contain at least one codec that was negotiated
during the original session. If the SC UE determines to remove a media
component during the transfer, then the media line for this media component
shall include a port number with value zero;
2) One speech media component to be transferred, corresponding to the speech
media component in the session on the CS Source Access Leg; and
3) If the SC UE determines to add new media component(s) during the transfer,
then one additional media line with the desired media type and codecs shall be
added for each new media component.
If the SC UE receives any SIP 4xx -- 6xx response to the SIP INVITE request,
then session transfer has not occurred and the call will continue in the
original domains.
## 11.3 SCC AS
### 11.3.1 Distinction of requests sent to the SCC AS
The SCC AS needs to distinguish between the following initial SIP INVITE
requests to provide specific functionality relating to access transfer:
  * SIP INVITE requests routed to the SCC AS containing a STI belonging to the subscribed user in the Replaces header field or Target-Dialog header field. In the procedures below, such requests are known as \"SIP INVITE requests due to STI\".
  * SIP INVITE requests routed to the SCC AS containing either a static STN or an IMRN in the Request-URI. In the procedures below, such requests are known as \"SIP INVITE requests due to static STN\".
  * SIP INVITE requests routed to the SCC AS containing a static STI in the Request-URI and a STI in the Replaces or Target-Dialog header field. In the procedures below, such requests are known as \"SIP INVITE requests due to two STIs\".
NOTE: The media streams that need to be transferred are identified using
information described in the subsequent subclauses 11.3.2 and 11.3.3.
Other SIP initial requests for a dialog and requests for a SIP standalone
transaction can be dealt with in any manner conformant with 3GPP TS 24.229
[2].
### 11.3.2 SCC AS procedures for PS to PS+CS session continuity
This subclause does not apply to recepetion of a SIP INVITE request due to STI
with a CS media.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to STI with PS and CS media
on the Target Access Leg, the SCC AS shall follow the PS-PS session continuity
procedures specified in subclause 10.3.2 with the following exceptions:
\- If the SIP INVITE request includes an active speech media component using
CS bearer, then the SCC AS shall follow the procedures for SCC AS for service
control over Gm in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] to send the PSI DN to the SC UE and wait
for the SC UE to set up CS bearer before sending re-INVITE to the remote end.
The SCC AS shall correlate the STI with the allocated PSI DN in order to
identify the remote leg to be updated.
\- If service control over Gm is retained on the source access leg, and the
SCC AS receives a re-INVITE request indicating CS bearer on an existing
session, the SCC AS shall follow procedures as described in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4]
subclause 8.4.2 to send the PSI DN to the SC UE and wait for the SC UE to set
up CS bearer before sending re-INVITE to the remote end.
\- The SCC AS shall include a new SDP offer in the re-INVITE request,
following the rules specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2], containing the following
media information:
\- the media characteristics as received in the SIP INVITE request due to STI
with PS+CS media received on the Target Access Leg for media streams whose
port is not set to zero; and
\- the media characteristics as received in the SIP re-INVITE request for
media streams whose port is not set to zero.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to static STN on the Target
Access Leg, the SCC AS shall follow the PS-CS session continuity procedures
specified in subclause 9.3.2. However, as the Source Access Leg contains media
components other than speech media component, the SCC AS does not initiate
release for Source Access Leg.
### 11.3.3 SCC AS procedures for PS+CS to PS session continuity
This subclause applies to reception of a SIP INVITE request due to STI with a
PS media only.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to STI on the Target Access
Leg, the SCC AS shall follow the PS-PS session continuity procedures specified
in subclause 10.3.2.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to two STIs on the Target
Access Leg, the SCC AS shall:
  * associate the SIP INVITE request received on the Target Access Leg with two ongoing sessions:
a) an ongoing SIP dialog on the PS Source Access Leg: This is done by matching
the dialog ID present in the Replaces header field (see IETF RFC 3891 [10]) or
Target-Dialog header field (see IETF RFC 4538 [11]) of the SIP INVITE request
with an ongoing dialog. By an ongoing SIP dialog, it is meant a dialog for
which a SIP 2xx response to the initial SIP INVITE request has been sent or
received;
b) a different ongoing SIP dialog with active speech media component:
  * if the SCC AS is unable to associate the SIP INVITE request with either one of the above two dialogs, send a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to reject the SIP INVITE request relating to the access transfer and not process the remaining steps; and
  * if the session transfer is possible:
a) follow the procedures defined in IETF RFC 3891 [10] for replacing the two
sessions on the Source Access Legs with the SIP request received on the Target
Access Leg, including terminating the two Source Access Legs by sending a SIP
BYE request on each session towards the SC UE in accordance with 3GPP TS
24.229 [2]; and
b) send a SIP re-INVITE request towards the remote UE using the existing
established dialog. The SCC AS shall populate the SIP re-INVITE request as
follows:
1) set the Request-URI to the URI contained in the Contact header field
returned at the creation of the dialog with the remote UE; and
2) a new SDP offer, including the media characteristics as received in the SIP
INVITE request due to two STIs received on the Target Access Leg, by following
the rules of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
# 12 Roles for PS-CS session continuity, Single Radio
## 12.1 Introduction
This clause specifies the procedures for PS-CS session continuity in Single
Radio VCC. Procedures are specified for the SC UE and the SCC AS. For SC UE or
SCC AS not supporting ICS procedures, PS-CS session continuity in SR-VCC
enables transfer of single full-duplex session with active speech media
component.
## 12.2 SC UE procedures for PS to CS session continuity, SR-VCC
### 12.2.1 General
The SC UE may be engaged in one or more ongoing IMS sessions before SR-VCC
session continuity is performed. By an ongoing session, it is meant a session
for which the SIP 2xx response for the initial SIP INVITE request to establish
this session has been sent or received.
In the SR-VCC session continuity procedures the SC UE shall consider only
sessions where the following applies:
1\. the session does have a speech media component; and
2\. the speech media is carried over PS bearer with traffic-class conversation
with source statistics descriptor =\"speech\" as specified in 3GPP TS 23.107
[17]) or over an PS bearer with QCI=1 as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [16])
for access transfer. Sessions considered for SR-VCC procedures are regarded as
full-duplex.
### 12.2.2 ICS-based
If:
\- IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled;
\- the Gm reference point is retained upon PS handover procedure;
\- the SC UE is using ICS capabilities; and
\- SR-VCC procedures (as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8]) have been completed;
the SC UE, in order to add Gm control for the newly established CS session,
shall:
\- send a SIP re-INVITE request for each session with speech media component
to be transferred, starting with the full-duplex session with active speech
media component that was most recently made active; and
\- within the SDP offer indicate the media line for the speech media component
(active or held) as an audio stream over circuit switched bearer in accordance
with 3GPP TS 24.292 [4]. If the precondition mechanism is used, the SC UE
shall indicate the related local preconditions as met.
NOTE: Within SR-VCC the handover is performed on PS level. Due to this, the
SIP dialog established over the source PS access network stays the same after
SR-VCC procedures, e.g. the IP address of the UE, the Call-ID, the P-CSCF do
not change. Therefore in this case a re-INVITE needs to be sent to add ICS-
control for the CS bearer.
### 12.2.3 Not based on ICS
After successful SR-VCC procedures (as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8]), if
the SC UE is not using ICS capabilities, the SC UE shall replace the ongoing
session with active speech media component which was made active most recently
with the newly established CS voice call.
NOTE: In the case when ICS is not supported or used, only the ongoing session
with active speech media component which was made active most recently is
transferred from PS to CS audio.
If:
\- the Gm reference point is retained upon PS handover;
\- the SC UE is not using ICS capabilities; and
\- SR-VCC procedures (as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8]) have been completed;
the SC UE shall:
\- send a SIP re-INVITE request to the SCC AS as specified for media removal
in subclause 13.2.1; and
\- indicate in the SDP offer the speech media component as removed.
## 12.3 SCC AS
### 12.3.0 General
In the SR-VCC access transfer procedures the SCC AS shall only consider
sessions that have a speech media component and that are subject to SRVCC as
defined in subclause 4.2.2 for access transfer.
### 12.3.1 SCC AS procedures for PS to CS session continuity, SR-VCC
The SCC AS needs to distinguish between the following SIP INVITE requests to
provide specific functionality for SR-VCC:
\- SIP INVITE request routed to the SCC AS due to a STN-SR belonging to the
subscribed user in the Request-URI. These SIP INVITE requests originate from
the MSC server. In the procedures below, such requests are known as \"SIP
INVITE requests due to STN-SR\".
\- SIP re-INVITE request routed to the SCC AS containing one or more already
existing media lines for audio indicate a CS bearer. In the procedures below,
such requests are known as \"SIP re-INVITE requests adding ICS control\".
\- SIP re-INVITE request routed to the SCC AS containing one or more already
existing media lines for audio indicate the port set to \"0\". In the
procedures below, such requests are known as \"SIP re-INVITE requests for non-
ICS control\".
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request due to STN-SR on the Target
Access Leg, the SCC AS shall follow the PS-CS session continuity procedures
specified in subclause 9.3.2 for the session
\- with active speech media component that was most recently made active; and
\- which is a confirmed dialog.
.However, the SCC AS does not initiate release for Source Access Leg and does
not send a SIP re-INVITE request to update the Source Access Leg.
If the SCC AS has sent a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to reject
a SIP INVITE request due to STN-SR on the Target Access Leg:
1) if the speech media component to be transferred was the only media
component in the SIP dialog, the SCC AS shall release the remote leg as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]; or
2) if the SIP dialog contains other media components than the active speech
media component, the SCC AS shall modify the remote leg and remove the speech
media component, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
When the SCC AS receives a SIP re-INVITE request for adding ICS control, the
SCC AS shall follow the procedures as described for ICS using Gm in subclause
13.3.2.
NOTE: When using the ICS controlled CS bearer, only one audio call can be
active at a time. Nevertheless, several calls can be held in parallel. If the
user decides to switch to another (previously held) call, the ICS controlled
CS bearer is re-used for this call. Therefore no specific procedures for
handling of held calls in the case of ICS controlled CS bearer are needed.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP re-INVITE request for non-ICS control, the SCC
AS shall follow the media removal procedures as specified in subclause 13.3.1.
As only the session with active speech media component which was made active
most recently is transferred from PS to CS audio, the SCC AS shall drop all
other previously existing speech media components from this UE and indicate
them accordingly in the SDP offer sent within SIP re-INVITE requests towards
the remote UE.
# 13 Roles for media adding/deleting
## 13.1 Introduction
This clause specifies the procedures for adding or deleting media to an
existing multimedia session. Procedures are specified for the SC UE and the
SCC AS.
## 13.2 SC UE
### 13.2.1 Adding or removing media through Gm
If the SC UE wants to add or remove media components to a session that was
previously established using Gm reference point, the SC UE shall follow the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] for adding/removing PS media.
If the SC UE wants to transfer media components from the source access leg to
an existing target access leg (i.e the access legs were previously established
due to the partial session transfer) using Gm reference point, the SC UE
shall:
1\. add the media components to the target access leg; and
2\. remove those media components from the source access leg,
by using procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] for adding/removing PS
media.
If IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled then if the SC UE wants to add
or remove CS media components to a session, it shall follow the procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4].
If the SC UE receives a SIP re-INVITE request or a SIP UPDATE request from the
remote end to add or remove media components to a session that was previously
established using Gm, the SC UE shall:
\- follow the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] for adding or removing
PS media; and
\- if IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled, follow the procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] for adding or removing CS media to the session.
### 13.2.2 Adding Gm control to existing CS session
The SC UE shall add Gm control to an existing CS session only when IMS service
continuity using ICS is enabled and when there is a single full-duplex session
with speech media component over CS. If there is more than one full-duplex
session with speech media component, the SC UE shall release all the ongoing
sessions that are not currently active before attempting the procedures
described in this section.
If IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled and the SC UE wants to add Gm
control to an existing CS session that was established without Gm, after
registering with the IM CN subsystem, the SC UE shall send an initial SIP
INVITE request over the PS access in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]. The
SC UE shall populate the SIP INVITE request as follows:
\- set the Request-URI to the static STI; and
\- set the SDP payload, in accordance with the procedures defined in 3GPP TS
24.292 [4], proposing a speech media component over a circuit switched bearer.
The SC UE can optionally include additional PS media to the SDP in accordance
to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
Upon receiving a SIP 200 (OK) response, the SC UE shall treat the ongoing CS
call as established using Gm and shall follow the \"ICS UE using Gm\"
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] for controlling the CS call.
If IMS service continuity using ICS is enabled and the SC UE receives a new
SIP INVITE request containing a speech media component over a circuit-switched
bearer in the SDP and the SCC AS PSI DN matches the B-party number of the
ongoing CS call that was established without Gm, the SC UE shall:
\- respond to the SIP INVITE request in accordance with the procedures defined
in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4]; and
\- treat the ongoing CS call as established using Gm and shall follow the
\"ICS UE using Gm\" procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] for controlling
the CS call.
## 13.3 SCC AS
### 13.3.1 Adding or removing media through Gm
If the SCC AS receives a SIP re-INVITE request or a SIP UPDATE request from
the SC UE, in which already existing media components of the session are
transferred from a source access leg to an already existing target access leg
(i.e. the target access leg was already established due to partial session
transfer), the SCC AS shall update the remote end using the session transfer
procedures defined in subclause 10.3.2.
NOTE: The SC UE indicates that media is switched from the source access leg to
the target access leg by using the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]
for adding / removing PS media, i.e. the related connection and port
information of the transferred media component within the SDP is changed from
the source access leg to the target access leg.
If the SCC AS receives a SIP re-INVITE request or a SIP UPDATE request from
the SC UE or remote end to add/remove new media components, to an existing
access leg of the session established using Gm, the SCC AS shall follow the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] for adding or removing PS media and
shall follow the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] for adding or
removing CS media to the session.
### 13.3.2 Adding Gm control to existing CS session
If the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request containing the static STI in the
Request-URI the SCC AS shall determine if this SIP INVITE request is for an
ongoing call by determining if the received contents of SIP INVITE request\'s
Contact header field is bound to an ongoing CS call session identifier. If the
SC UE has an ongoing CS call, the SCC AS shall:
\- respond to the SIP INVITE request in accordance with the procedures defined
in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4];
\- treat the ongoing CS call as established using Gm and shall follow the
\"SCC AS for service control over Gm\" procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.292
[4] for controlling the CS call; and
\- if the SIP INVITE request contains additional PS media, the SCC AS shall
send a SIP re-INVITE request towards the remote end, including the newly added
PS media, in accordance with the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
The SCC AS shall add Gm control to an existing CS session only when there is a
single session with speech media component over CS. If the SCC AS wants to add
Gm control to an existing CS session that was established without Gm, the SCC
AS shall send a new SIP INVITE request over the PS access in accordance with
3GPP TS 24.229 [2]. The SCC AS shall populate the SIP INVITE request as
follows:
\- set the Request-URI to the public user identity of the UE; and
\- set the SDP payload, in accordance with the procedures defined in 3GPP TS
24.292 [4], proposing a speech media component over a circuit switched bearer.
Upon receiving a SIP 200 (OK) response, the SCC AS shall treat the ongoing CS
call as established using Gm and shall follow the \"SCC AS for service control
over Gm\" procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.292 [4] for controlling the CS
call.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Example signalling flows
# A.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for Service Continuity based on
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and SIP Events.
These signalling flows provide detailed signalling flows, which expand on the
overview information flows provided in 3GPP TS 23.237 [9].
# A.2 Introduction
## A.2.1 General
The signalling flows provided in this annex follow the methodology developed
in 3GPP TS 24.228 [3].
## A.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The key to interpret signalling flows specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 [3]
subclauses 4.1 and 4.2 applies with the additions specified below:
\- tel:+1-237-555-1111 represents the public user indentity of SC UE A.
\- tel:+1-237-555-2222 represents the public user indentity of UE B.
\- sip:sccas1.home1.net represents the Internet host of SCC AS.
Each signalling flow table contains descriptions for headers where the content
of the header is new to that signalling flow, as is already performed in 3GPP
TS 24.228 [3].
However, 3GPP TS 24.228 [3] includes extensive descriptions for the contents
of various headers following each of the tables representing the contents of
the signalling flows. Where the operation of the header is identical to that
shown in 3GPP TS 24.228 [3], then such text is not reproduced in the present
document.
Additional text may also be found on the contents of headers within 3GPP TS
24.228 [3] in addition to the material shown in the present document.
In order to differentiate between messages for SIP and media, the notation in
figure A.2-1 is used.
Figure A.2-1: Signalling flow notation
# A.3 Signalling flows for registration
## A.3.1 Introduction
When using CS access for media and to make use of the IMS ISC procedures, the
SC UE is registered in IM CN subsystem and the signalling flows are defined in
3GPP TS 24.292 [4] subclause A.2.
When initiating a CS call, the SC UE can be registered in the CS domain as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
Whenever the UE acquires IP connectivity via an IP-CAN, the signalling flows
for registration in the IMS are defined in 3GPP TS 24.228 [3].
## A.3.2 Signalling flows for multiple registration
The signalling flows shown in figure A.3.2-1 gives an example when a UE
connects to different IP-CAN respectively and performs multiple registrations.
In this example the SCC AS receives the registration state information that it
needs to implement SCC specific requirements from the third-party REGISTER
request.

# A.4 Signalling flows for call origination
## A.4.1 Session origination for CS calls
An example flow for session origination for CS calls can be found in 3GPP TS
24.292 [4].
# A.5 Signalling flows for call termination
## A.5.1 Session termination using CS media
An example flow for session termination using CS calls can be found in 3GPP TS
24.292 [4].
# A.6 Signalling flows for PS-CS session continuity
## A.6.1 PS-CS access transfer: CS-PS
In this example, SC UE A has an ongoing session with remote UE B over CS
bearer before access transfer. When SC UE connects to an IP-CAN, it decides to
transfer the session over the new IP-CAN.
Figure A.6.1-1: Signalling flow for PS-CS Access Transfer: CS to PS
NOTE 1: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) responses are not shown in the
signalling flow.
  1. **SC UE A has an ongoing session with remote UE B**
The call has been anchored at the SCC AS which is in the HPLMN of originating
SC UE A.
**2\. SC UE A connects to a new IP-CAN:**
The SC UE A decides to transfer the session over the new IP-CAN. The UE A
obtains an IP address that it will use for the signalling and media. It
registers with the S-CSCF over the new IP-CAN using standard registration
procedure and reserves resources in the new IP-CAN.
**3\. SIP INVITE request (SC UE A to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) -
see example in table A.6.1-3**

> **4\. Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF evaluates initial filter criteria for the served SC user and as a
result routes the SIP INVITE request towards the SCC AS.
**5\. SIP INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC AS)**
The SIP INVITE request is forwarded to the SCC AS as the result of the
evaluation of iFC.
6\. **Remote Leg Update**
The SCC AS performs the Remote Leg update by sending the SIP re-INVITE request
towards the Remote Leg.
7\. **SIP re-INVITE request (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)-
See example in table A.6.1-7**
The SCC AS modifies the message in accordance with routeing B2BUA
functionality, e.g. mapping of From, To, Cseq and Call-ID headers from one
side of the B2BUA to the other. In this example the SCC AS includes the
contents of the Contact header from the received SIP INVITE request.The SIP
re-INVITE request contains the SDP offer that is identical to the SDP offer
that the SCC AS received in the initial SIP INVITE request from the UE A (Step
3).

# A.7 Signalling flows for PS-PS session continuity
## A.7.1 Introduction
The signalling flows for PS-PS access transfer demonstrate how a multimedia
session is transferred from Source Access Leg to the Target Access Leg. The
following signalling flows are included:
\- subclause A.7.2 shows an example when all media of an ongoing communication
session and the associated signalling are transferred from Source Access Leg
to the Target Access Leg; and
\- subclause A.7.3 shows an example when not all media of an ongoing
communication session are transferred from the Source Access Leg to the Target
Access Leg.
## A.7.2 PS-PS access transfer with full media transfer
The signalling flows shown in figure A.7.2-1 describes the PS-PS access
transfer procedure when all media of an ongoing communication session and the
associated signalling are transferred from one contact address of an UE to a
different contact address of the same UE. No lower-level mechanism to support
the session continuity is assumed or need.
In this example the UE-1 is on an active multimedia session with the UE-2 via
one IP-CAN. After changing to a new IP‑CAN, obtaining a new IP address, and
discovering a P-CSCF, the UE-1 reserves resources in new IP-CAN prior to
initiating the PS-PS access transfer procedure. When the PS-PS access transfer
procedure is completed, the UE-1 continues the multimedia session with the
UE-2 on the new IP-CAN. In this example, when attaching to the new IP-CAN, it
is irrelevant whether the UE-1 uses the same P-CSCF or a new P-CSCF.
NOTE 1: This scenario requires that the UE-1 and the IMS network support
simultaneous multiple registrations and requires that the UE-1 supports dual
mode operation.
NOTE 2: In this example flow, each call leg is uniquely identified with a
respective dialog identifier consisting of the Call-ID, From tag, and To tag.
Figure A.7.2-1: Signalling flow for session handover
NOTE 3: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) responses are not shown in the
signalling flow.
**1\. UE-1 is on an active session with UE-2**
> The UE-1 is in an active session with the UE-2. The call is anchored in the
> SCC AS. It is irrelevant which endpoint initiated the call. Each call leg is
> uniquely identified with a respective dialog identifier. The call leg over
> old IP-CAN is identified with \"Call-ID= me03a0s09a2sdfgjkl491777\", \"From
> tag=64727891\", and \"To tag=774321\". The UE-1 and UE-2 exchange media over
> the old IP-CAN, which is maintained while the UE-1 initiates the handover
> procedure.
**2\. UE-1 connects to new IP** -**CAN**
The UE-1 determines that a handover of the session is required. The UE-1
connects to the new IP-CAN. The UE-1 obtains an IP address that it will use
for the signalling and media.
**3\. UE-1 registers with intermediate IM CN subsystem entities over new IP-
CAN**
The UE-1 registers with the S-CSCF over the new IP-CAN using the standard
registration procedure. Depending on the UE-1 configuration, the discovery of
the P-CSCF in the new IP-CAN may be needed.
**4\. UE-1 acquires resources in new IP-CAN**
Based on the UE-1 and new IP-CAN capabilities, the UE-1 decides to use the
same codec that was used over the old IP-CAN. The UE-1 reserves resources
(e.g. QoS) in the new IP-CAN that will be needed for the signalling and
transferred media, prior to sending the initial SIP INVITE request.
**5\. SIP INVITE request (UE-1 to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) \-
see example in table A.7.2-5**
The UE-1 sends initial SIP INVITE request with a new SDP offer to the UE-2
that indicates that the new call replaces the existing call. The initial SIP
INVITE request establishes a dialog for signalling and specifies in the SDP
the new contact address that will be used for media over the new IP-CAN. Upon
sending the initial SIP INVITE request, the UE-1 is ready to receive the RTP
packets either over the new IP-CAN or the old IP-CAN. The RTP packets may
arrive over the new IP-CAN prior to the UE-1 receiving the SIP 200 (OK)
response for the initial SIP INVITE request.

**8\. Remote leg update**
The SCC AS based on the content of the Replaces header correlates the initial
SIP INVITE request to the existing local and remote call legs of the existing
concatenated end to end session between the UE-1 and UE-2. The SCC AS updates
the remote call leg by sending a SIP re-INVITE request to the UE-2 containing
the new SDP offer that it has received from the UE-1.
**9\. SIP re-INVITE request (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)
- see example in table A.7.2-9**
> The UE-2 is informed of the change in access leg by the SCC AS sending a SIP
> re-INVITE request to the S-CSCF.
The SCC AS modifies the message in accordance with routeing B2BUA
functionality, e.g. mapping of From, To, Cseq and Call-ID headers from one
side of the B2BUA to the other. In this example the SCC AS includes the
contents of the Contact header from the received SIP INVITE request. The SIP
re-INVITE request contains the SDP offer that is identical to the SDP offer
that the SCC AS received in the initial SIP INVITE request from the UE-1 (Step
5).

## A.7.3 PS-PS access transfer with partial media transfer
The signalling flows shown in figure A.7.3-1 describes the PS-PS access
transfer procedure when not all media of an ongoing communication session are
transferred from the Source Access Leg to the Target Access Leg. No lower-
level mechanism to support the session continuity is assumed or needed.
In this example, UE‑1 is on an active multimedia session with UE‑2 via one
IP‑CAN. After connecting to an additional IP‑CAN, obtaining an additional IP
address, discovering a P-CSCF, and performing IMS registration, UE-1 reserves
resources in the new IP‑CAN prior to initiating the PS-PS access transfer
procedure. When the PS-PS access transfer procedure is completed, UE‑1
continues the multimedia session with UE‑2 on both the old and the new
IP‑CANs. In this example, when attaching to the new IP‑CAN, it is irrelevant
whether the UE‑1 uses the same P‑CSCF or a new P‑CSCF.
NOTE 1: This scenario requires that UE-1 and the IMS network support
simultaneous multiple registrations and requires that UE-1 supports dual mode
operation.
Figure A.7.3-1: Signalling flow for PS-PS session transfer with partial media
transfer
NOTE 2: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) responses are not shown in the
signalling flow.
**1\. UE‑1 is on an active session with UE‑2**
> UE-1 is in an active session with UE-2. The call is anchored in the SCC AS.
> It is irrelevant which endpoint initiated the call. Each call leg is
> uniquely identified with a respective dialog identifier. The call leg over
> IP-CAN #1 is identified with \"Call-ID= me03a0s09a2sdfgjkl491777\", \"From
> tag=64727891\", and \"To tag=774321\". UE-1 and UE-2 exchange media over the
> IP-CAN #1, which is maintained while the UE-1 initiates the session transfer
> procedure.
**2\. UE‑1 connects to IP-CAN #2**
UE-1 connects to the new IP-CAN and obtains an IP address that it will use for
the signalling and media.
**3\. UE‑1 registers with intermediate IM CN subsystem entities over IP-CAN
#2**
UE-1 registers with the S-CSCF over the IP-CAN #2 using the standard
registration procedure. The P-CSCF in the signalling path of this registration
may be distinct from the one used in the signalling path over IP-CAN #1.
**4\. UE‑1 acquires resources in IP-CAN #2**
UE-1 decides to perform partial media transfer to the IP-CAN #2. Based on UE-1
and IP-CAN #2 capabilities, the UE-1 decides to use the same codec that was
used over the IP-CAN #1 for the media components to be transferred. UE-1
ensures that the resources (e.g. QoS) in IP-CAN #2 that will be needed for the
signalling and transferred media are available, prior to sending the initial
SIP INVITE request.
**5\. SIP INVITE request (UE-1 to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) \-
see example in table A.7.3-5**
UE‑1 sends initial SIP INVITE request with a new SDP offer to UE‑2 and
indicates that the video component is to be transferred to IP-CAN #2. The
initial SIP INVITE request establishes a dialog for signalling and specifies
in the SDP new contact address that will be used for media over IP-CAN #2.
Upon sending the initial SIP INVITE request, UE-1 is ready to receive the RTP
packets over both IP-CAN #1 and IP-CAN #2.

**6\. Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
Upon the evaluation of the initial filter criteria, as this is an originating

initial SIP INVITE request to the SCC AS.
**7\. SIP INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC AS)**
The initial SIP INVITE request is forwarded from **intermediate IM CN
subsystem entities** in the home network to the SCC AS. The SCC AS acts as a
routeing B2BUA as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
**8\. Remote leg update**
Based on the content of the Target-Dialog header, the SCC AS correlates the
SIP INVITE request for session transfer to the existing local and remote call
legs of the existing concatenated end to end session between UE-1 and UE-2.
The SCC AS updates the remote call leg by sending a SIP re-INVITE request to
the UE-2 containing the new SDP offer based on the partial media transfer
request received from UE-1 and the negotiated SDP for the original session.
**9\. SIP re-INVITE request (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)
- see example in table A.7.3-9**

The SCC AS modifies the message in accordance with routeing B2BUA
functionality, e.g. mapping of From, To, Cseq and Call-ID headers from one
side of the B2BUA to the other. In this example the SCC AS includes the
contents of the Contact header from the received SIP INVITE request.The SIP
re-INVITE request contains the SDP offer that is based on original SDP offer
and the SDP offer that the SCC AS received in the initial SIP INVITE request
from the UE-1 (Step 7).

**Route:** The SIP re-INVITE request contains the saved list of Route headers
that the SCC AS has saved for the remote leg of the call.
**SDP: specifies the new IP address and ports used for the media components.
In this case, the audio component is still using the original address and port
while the video component is using the new IP address and new port
allocated.**
**10\. SIP re-INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to
intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)**
In the originating network, the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities forward
the SIP re-INVITE request to the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities in the
terminating network.
**11\. SIP re-INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to UE-2)**
In the terminating network, **the SIP re-INVITE request is forwarded towards**
UE-2 by the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities.
> UE-2 receives the SIP re-INVITE request containing the SDP offer that
> indicates that UE-1 is ready to receive video media on a different contact
> address. Since UE-2 has resources already available, it starts to send the
> media to UE-1\'s contact address specified in the SDP offer immediately.
>
> UE-1 starts receiving the video RTP packets over IP-CAN #2. However, UE-1
> may receive some out-of-sequence video RTP packets over IP-CAN #1. The video
> RTP packets are delivered to the codec in sequence. Once UE-1 determine that
> no video will be received over IP-CAN #1 (e.g. by examining the sequence
> numbers in the RTP headers), it may relinquish the resources that it has
> been using for incoming video media on IP-CAN #1.
>
> At the same time, UE-1 still sends both the audio and video media to UE-2
> over IP-CAN #1.
>
> Resources used for signalling on IP-CAN #1 are not released.
**12\. SIP 200 (OK) response (UE-2 to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)
-- see example in table A.7.3-12**
Upon receiving the SIP re-INVITE request containing the SDP offer, since UE-2
has all resources available, it sends immediately the SIP 200 (OK) response to
the SIP re-INVITE request that contains the SDP answer. The SDP answer
indicates that the resources are available.

# A.8 Signalling flows for PS-PS session continuity in conjunction with PS-CS
session continuity
## A.8.1 Introduction
The signalling flows for PS-PS access transfer conjunction with PS-CS access
transfer demonstrate how a multimedia session is tranferred from Source Access
Leg to the Target Access Leg. The following signalling flows are included:
\- subclause A.8.2 shows an example when a multimedia session is transferred
from one IP-CAN to a new IP-CAN and the CS bearer respectively ; and
\- subclause A.8.3 shows an example when a multimedia session is transferred
from one IP-CAN and CS bearer to a new IP-CAN.
## A.8.2 PS - PS in conjunction with PS - CS Access Transfer: PS to CS
In this example, SC UE A has an ongoing multimedia session with remote UE B
over IP-CAN#1 before access transfer. When SC UE connects to a new IP-CAN#2,
it decides to transfer the multimedia session over the new IP-CAN#2 and the CS
bearer respectively.
Figure A.8.2-1: Signalling flow for PS - PS in conjunction with PS - CS Access
Transfer: PS to CS
NOTE 1: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) responses are not shown in the
signalling flow.
  1. **SC UE A has an ongoing multimedia session with remote UE B**
The call has been anchored at the SCC AS which is in the HPLMN of originating
SC UE A. The call leg over old IP-CAN is identified with \"Call-ID=
me03a0s09a2sdfgjkl491777\", \"From tag=64727891\", and \"To tag=774321\". The
UE A and UE B exchange media over the old IP-CAN, which is maintained while
the SC UE A initiates the handover procedure.
> Table A.8.2-1 shows an example of the SDP offer from SC UE A to remote UE B.
NOTE 2: To later show how the media is transferred to the new IP-CAN and CS
bearer, only the SDP offer is shown in table A.8.2-1.

**2\. SC UE A connects to a new IP-CAN#2:**
The SC UE A decides to transfer the multimedia session over the new IP-CAN and
CS bearer respectively. The UE A obtains an IP address that it will use for
the signalling and media. It registers with the S-CSCF over the new IP-CAN
using multiple registrations procedure. Depending on the UE A configuration,
the discovery of the P-CSCF in the new IP-CAN may be needed. Based on the UE A
and new IP-CAN capabilities, the UE A decides to use the same codec that was
used over the old IP-CAN. The UE A reserves resources (e.g. QoS) in the new
IP-CAN that will be needed for the signalling and transferred media, prior to
sending the initial SIP INVITE request.
**3\. SIP INVITE request (SC UE A to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)-
see example in table A.8.2-3**
> The SC UE A sends an initial SIP INVITE request with a STI and a new SDP
> offer to the UE B that indicates that the new call replaces the existing
> call. The initial SIP INVITE request establishes a dialog for signalling and
> specifies in the SDP a new contact address that will be used for non-
> realtime media over the new IP-CAN. Upon sending the initial SIP INVITE
> request, the UE A is ready to receive the RTP packets either over the new
> IP-CAN or the old IP-CAN. The RTP packets may arrive over the new IP-CAN
> prior to the SC UE are receiving the SIP 200 (OK) response for the initial
> SIP INVITE request.

> **4\. Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF evaluates initial filter criteria for the served SC user and as a
result routes the SIP INVITE request towards the SCC AS.
**5\. SIP INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC AS)**
The SIP INVITE request is forwarded to the SCC AS as the result of the
evaluation of iFC.
6\. **Remote Leg Update**
The SCC AS identifies the session to be transferred using the STI. The SCC AS
performs the Remote Leg update by sending the SIP re-INVITE request towards
the Remote Leg.
7\. **SIP re-INVITE request (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)-
See example in table A.8.2-7**
The SCC AS modifies the message in accordance with routeing B2BUA
functionality, e.g. mapping of From, To, Cseq and Call-ID headers from one
side of the B2BUA to the other. In this example the SCC AS includes the
contents of the Contact header from the received SIP INVITE request. The SIP
re-INVITE request contains the SDP offer that is identical to the SDP offer
that the SCC AS received in the initial SIP INVITE request from the UE A (Step
3).

21\. **SIP INVITE request** (Intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC AS)
22\. **Remote Leg Update**
The SCC AS performs the Remote Leg update by sending the SIP re-INVITE request
towards the Remote Leg.
  1. **SIP re-INVITE request (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) --see example in table A.8.2-23**
The SCC AS acting as a routing B2BUA generates a SIP INVITE request based upon
the received SIP INVITE request and the information previously stored against
this session and routes it towards UE B via the intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities. In this example the SCC AS includes the contents of the Contact
header from the received SIP INVITE request.

  1. **SIP re-INVITE request (Intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to UE B)**
> Intermediate IM CN subsystem entities forward the SIP re-INVITE request to
> remote UE B.
**25\. SIP 200 (OK) response (UE B to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)**
Upon receiving the SIP re-INVITE request containing the SDP offer, since the
UE B has all resources available, it sends immediately the SIP 200 (OK)
response to the SIP re-INVITE request that contains the SDP answer. The SDP
answer indicates that the resources are available.
**26\. SIP 200 (OK) response (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC
AS)**
> The intermediate IM CN subsystem entities forward the SIP 200 (OK) response
> to the SIP re-INVITE request to the SCC AS in the originating network.
27-28. **SIP ACK request (SCC AS to UE B via IM CN subsystem entities)**
The SCC AS generates the SIP ACK request to the SIP 200 (OK) response, and
forwards the SIP ACK request to the remote UE B.
29-30. **SIP 200 (OK) response** **(SCC AS to interworking entities via IM CN
subsystem entities)**
The SCC AS generates the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP INVITE request, and
forwards the SIP 200 (OK) response to the interworking entities.
31\. **ISUP CONNECT message (interworking entities to SC UE A)**
32\. **ISUP CONNECT Response message (SC UE A to interworking entities)**
33-34. **SIP ACK request (interworking entities to SCC AS via IM CN subsystem
entities)**
The interworking entities generate the SIP ACK request to the SIP 200 (OK)
response, and forward it to the SCC AS.
35-36: **SIP BYE request (SCC AS to SC UE A via intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities)**
The SCC AS terminates the replaced call leg, which was using the old IP-CAN,
by sending a BYE request to the UE A.
**37-38. SIP 200 (OK) response (SC UE A to SCC AS via intermediate IM CN
subsystem entities)**
> Upon receiving the BYE request over the old IP-CAN, the SC UE A sends a SIP
> 200 (OK) response over the old IP-CAN to the SCC AS. Subsequently, the SC UE
> A relinquishes all resources pertaining to the old IP-CAN.
39\. **Media paths between SC UE A and UE B**
Finally, the non-realtime media path is over the new IP-CAN and the realtime
media is using the CS bearer.
## A.8.3 PS - PS in conjunction with PS - CS Access Transfer: CS to PS
In this example, SC UE A has an ongoing multimedia session with remote UE B
over IP-CAN#1 and CS bearer before access transfer. When SC UE connects to a
new IP-CAN#2, it decides to transfer all the multimedia session over the new
IP-CAN#2.
Figure A.8.3-1: Signalling flow for PS - PS in conjunction with PS - CS Access
Transfer: CS to PS
NOTE 1: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) responses are not shown in the
signalling flow.
  1. **SC UE A has an ongoing multimedia session with remote UE B**
> The non realmedia path is over old IP-CAN#1 and the realtime media path is
> over the CS bearer. The call has been anchored at the SCC AS which is in the
> HPLMN of originating SC UE A. The call leg over old IP-CAN#1 is identified
> with \"Call-ID= me03a0s09a2sdfgjkl491777\", \"From tag=64727891\", and \"To
> tag=774321\". The UE A and UE B exchange media over the old IP-CAN, which is
> maintained while the SC UE A initiates the handover procedure.
>
> **2\. SC UE A connects to a new IP-CAN#2**
>
> The SC UE A decides to transfer the multimedia session over the new IP-
> CAN#2. The UE A obtains an IP address that it will use for the signalling
> and media. It registers with the S-CSCF over the new IP-CAN using multiple
> registrations procedure. Depending on the UE A configuration, the discovery
> of the P-CSCF in the new IP-CAN may be needed. Based on the UE A and new IP-
> CAN capabilities, the UE A decides to use the same codec that was used over
> the old IP-CAN. The UE A reserves resources (e.g. QoS) in the new IP-CAN
> that will be needed for the signalling and transferred media, prior to
> sending the initial SIP INVITE request.
**3\. SIP INVITE request (SC UE A to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)-
see example in table A.8.3-3**

**Request-URI: Contains the static STI.**
> **4\. Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF evaluates initial filter criteria for the served SC user and as a
result routes the SIP INVITE request towards the SCC AS.
**5\. SIP INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC AS)**
The SIP INVITE request is forwarded to the SCC AS as the result of the
evaluation of iFC.
**6**. **Remote Leg Update**
The SCC AS identifies the session to be transferred using the STI. The SCC AS
performs the Remote Leg update by sending the SIP re-INVITE request towards
the Remote Leg.
**7**. **SIP re** -**INVITE request (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities)- See example in table A.8.3-7**
The SCC AS modifies the message in accordance with routeing B2BUA
functionality, e.g. mapping of From, To, Cseq and Call-ID headers from one
side of the B2BUA to the other. In this example the SCC AS includes the
contents of the Contact header from the received SIP INVITE request. The SIP
re-INVITE request contains the SDP offer that is identical to the SDP offer
that the SCC AS received in the initial SIP INVITE request from the UE A (Step
3).

**3\. SIP re-INVITE request (Intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC
AS)**
**4-5. SIP 200 (OK) response (SCC AS to UE B via Intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities)**
The SCC AS generates the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP re-INVITE request
and forwards it to the remote UE B.
**6-7: SIP ACK request (UE B to SCC AS via Intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities)**
The UE B generates the SIP ACK request to the SIP SIP 200 (OK) response and
forwards it to the SCC AS.
**8-9: SIP BYE request (SCC AS to SC UE A via intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities)**
The SCC AS terminates the replaced call leg, which was using the IP-CAN, by
sending a SIP BYE request to the UE A.
**10-11. SIP 200 (OK) response (SC UE A to SCC AS via intermediate IM CN
subsystem entities)**
Upon receiving the BYE request over the IP-CAN, the SC UE A sends a SIP 200
(OK) response over the IP-CAN to the SCC AS. Subsequently, the SC UE A
relinquishes all resources pertaining to the IP-CAN.
**12\. Media paths between SC UE A and UE B**
Finally, the non-realtime media path over the IP-CAN is removed.
