# 0 Scope
This Technical Specification (TS) for Mobile communications specifies the
procedures used at the radio interface (reference point Um as defined in 3GPP
TS 24.002) for normal operation, registration, erasure, activation,
deactivation, invocation and interrogation of community of interest
supplementary services. The provision and withdrawal of supplementary services
is an administrative matter between the mobile subscriber and the service
provider and causes no signalling on the radio interface.
In 3GPP TS 24.010, the general aspects of the specification of supplementary
services at the layer 3 radio interface are given.
3GPP TS 24.080 specifies the formats coding for the supplementary services.
Definitions and descriptions of supplementary services are given in 3GPP TS
22.004 and 3GPP TS 22.08x and 3GPP TS 22.09x-series. 3GPP TS 22.085 is related
to the community of interest supplementary services.
Technical realization of supplementary services is described in technical
specifications 3GPP TS 23.011 and 3GPP TS TS 23.08x and 3GPP TS 23.09x-series.
3GPP TS 23.085 is related to the community of interest supplementary services.
The procedures for Call Control, Mobility Management and Radio Resource
management at the layer 3 radio interface are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 and
3GPP TS 24.008.
Signalling interworking for supplementary services between 3GPP TS 29.002 and
3GPP TS 24.008 and between 3GPP TS 29.002 and 3GPP TS 24.080 is defined in
3GPP TS 29.011.
The following supplementary services belong to the community of interest
supplementary services and are described in this TS:
‑ Closed User Group (CUG) clause 1.

Abbreviations used in this TS are listed in 3GPP TR 21.905.
# 1 Closed User Group (CUG)
## 1.1 Normal operation
### 1.1.1 Mobile originated CUG calls
#### 1.1.1.1 Successful operation
CUG calls may be invoked Implicitly or Explicitly by the calling user.
In the case of Implicit invocation, no CUG information is provided by the user
in the call set-up request and a default attribute of CUG is invoked. Normal
call establishment procedures are followed over the radio interface and no CUG
signalling is required.
In the case of Explicit CUG invocation, CUG information is provided by the
user and is included in the SETUP message using the ForwardCUG-Info operation
(see figure 1.1). User provided CUG information may consist of any combination
of the following parameters:
‑ CUG Index;
‑ Suppress Preferential CUG indicator;
‑ Suppress OA indicator.
NOTE: No more than one of each parameter may be included per call attempt.

Figure 1.1: Transfer of CUG information during CUG call set-up
If the network received a non-zero SS Screening indicator from the calling
user\'s mobile station, the network may optionally indicate to the MS that a
CUG has been invoked for a call (see figure 1.2). When a CUG Index is received
from the VLR the MSC shall send it immediately to the MS in a FACILITY or CALL
PROCEEDING message. If the network did not receive a non-zero SS Screening
indicator from the calling user\'s mobile station, it shall not send this
notification.
