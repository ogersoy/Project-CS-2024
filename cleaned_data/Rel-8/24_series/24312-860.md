# 1 Scope
The present document defines management objects that can be used by the Access
Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) and the UE.
The Management Object (MO) is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM)
protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA
DM Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [5].
The MO consists of relevant parameters for intersystem mobility policy- and
access network discovery information that can be managed by the ANDSF.
The service requirements and the functional requirements for the access
network discovery and selection are described in 3GPP TS 22.278 [2] and in
3GPP TS 23.402 [4] respectively.

# 4 ANDSF MO
The ANDSF MO is used to manage intersystem mobility policy- as well as access
network discovery information stored in a UE supporting provisioning of such
information from an ANDSF.
The ANDSF may initiate the provision of information from the ANDSF to the UE
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 [3AA].
The UE may initiate the provision of information from the ANDSF, using a
client initiated session alert message of code \"Generic Alert\". The \"Type\"
element of the OMA DM generic alert message shall be set to
\"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0:provision\".
The intersystem mobility policy information consists of a set of one or more
intersystem mobility policy rules. At any point in time there shall be at most
one rule applied, that rule is referred to as the \'active\' rule. There may
hence be zero or one \'active\' rule.
The rules have a number of conditions (e.g. current access technology and
location) where one or more may be present and set to a value. The rules also
have a number of results (e.g. preferred access technology and restricted
access technology) to be used whenever a rule is \'active\'. If there are no
results for the \'active\' rule, it is implementation dependent how UE
performs network selection. Irrespective of whether any rule is \'active\' or
not, the UE shall periodically re-evaluate ANDSF policies. When ANDSF policy
selection rules identify an available network, the highest priority rule
becomes \'active\' rule and network re-selection is performed.
While the rule remains \'active\', UE shall keep considering higher priority
networks, than currently selected, in the prioritized network list of the
rule. In addition to conditions and results there is a rule-priority that
shall be set for each rule in order for the UE to determine which rule, out of
potentially several valid rules, it should consider as \'active\'. The trigger
for (re-)evaluating rules is that the \'active\' rule becomes invalid
(conditions no longer fulfilled), or some other manufacturer specific trigger.
The relation between Policy and DiscoveryInformation is that Policies
prioritize the access network, while DiscoveryInformation provide further
information for the UE to access the access network defined in the policy.
The validity of the policy takes into account ValidityArea, Roaming and
TimeOfDay, which must all match in order to make the Policy valid.
The ANDSF server shall include at least one of the leaves (i.e. HESSID, SSID
or BSSID) to be present in a single instance of WLAN_Location interior node of
the ValidityArea of the Policy node and WLAN_Location interior node of the
AccessNetworkArea of the DiscoveryInformation node.
The MO has a node indicating the position of the UE. The trigger for updating
the value of this node is that the location information it contains is no
longer valid (i.e. the UE has changed its position) or some other manufacturer
specific trigger. The update of the information contained in this node doesn't
necessarily imply any interaction with the ANDSF server.
The MO defines validity areas, position of the UE and availability of access
networks in terms of geographical coordinates. The way such coordinates are
retrieved is implementation dependant (e.g. GPS receiver).
The UE is not required to switch on all UE\'s supported radios for deducing
its location for ANDSF purposes or for evaluating the validity area condition
of a policy or a discovery information.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism as standardized (see
Enabler Release Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [5]) may be used to grant or deny
access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and leaf objects of
the ANDSF MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the ANDSF node as
described in figure 4.1:

shall treat the rule with the lowest RulePriority value as the rule having the
highest priority among the valid rules. If there are overlapping rules (e.g.
by location, for example: rule by CGI, rule by PLMN), they should not have the
same priority. If the UE finds multiple rules with the same priority, the
choice of the rule is UE implementation specific. If there are no matching

shall be considered.

\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: \
In case more than one valid PrioritizedAccess are available and if the value

network (with the corresponding access identifier if present) with the lowest
AccessNetworkPriority value as the access network (with the corresponding
access identifier if present) having the highest priority, as defined in table
5.11.1. The AccessNetworkPriority value \'Restricted access\' (254) indicates
an access that should not be used by the UE. The AccessNetworkPriority value
\'Forbidden\' (255) indicates an access that shall not be used by the UE. The
same AccessNetworkPriority value may be used for more than one AccessId and
more than one Access Technology. If more than one AccessId or more than one
Access Technology with the same value of the AccessNetworkPriority are
avilable, the UE selects one of them in an implementation dependant way. If
the UE is not able to find an access network according to ANDSF policies, it
is implementation dependent how to proceed with network selection.

Value Description 0 Reserved 1-250 Priority value 251-253 Reserved 254
Restricted access. This access should be avoided if the current rule is
active. 255 Forbidden. UE is not allowed to use this access if the current

# 6 MO for WiMAX
## 6.1 Introduction
This section defines the WiMAX Network Discovery and Selection (WNDS) MO and
the corresponding behaviour of the UE with regard to discovering and selecting
WiMAX access networks in the home operator network. The service requirements
for the WiMAX network discovery and selection function are described in 3GPP
TS 23.402 [4].
The WNDS MO is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [5].
## 6.2 WNDS MO
The WNDS MO is used to manage WiMAX network discovery and selection
information stored in the UE and supports provisioning of such information
from the ANDSF.
The ANDSF may initiate the provisioning of WiMAX specific information using a
server initiated session alert message. The UE may initiate the provision of
information from the ANDSF using a client initiated session alert message.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-wnds:1.0.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism as standardized (see
Enabler Release Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [5]) may be used to grant or deny
access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and leaf objects of
the WNDS MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the WiMAX Network
Discovery and Selection node as described in figure 6.2.1:
Figure 6.2.1: WNDS MO
