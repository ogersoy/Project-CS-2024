# 4 General
## 4.1 Mobility management based on Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6
DSMIPv6 is specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27] and IETF RFC 5555 [2]. The purpose
of the DSMIPv6 procedures is to establish, manage and tear down a mobility
tunnel between the UE and the HA function. The mobility tunnel establishment
is always initiated by the UE, while the mobility tunnel tear down can be
initiated either by the UE or the network. Communication between the UE and a
correspondent node shall use the bidirectional mode of operation. Route
optimization mode of operation is not supported by EPC in this release.
In this specification, the IETF RFC 4877 [4] is used to secure DSMIPv6
signalling. For this purpose, the UE performs an IKEv2 exchange with the HA
before establishing the mobility tunnel as described in subclause 5.1.2.2. The
details of the security aspects are specified in 3GPP TS 33.402 [18].
The mobility tunnel procedures are performed by the UE for each PDN
connection, meaning that if multiple PDNs are accessed by the UE, multiple
instances of the procedures are needed. The multiple PDN connections behaviour
is specified more in detail in subclause 4.3.
In this specification, the IETF RFC 3963 [29] is used for prefix preservation.
For this purpose, the UE uses the implicit mode as stated in IETF RFC 3963
[29] to tell the HA that the home network prefix would be preserved during
mobility. The support of this operation is limited to the sending and
receiving of IPv6 packets containing IPv6 addresses auto-configured from the
home network prefix, in addition to the IPv6 Home Address.
## 4.2 Identities
The UE shall use Network Access Identifier (NAI) as identification towards the
HA in the IKEv2 exchange. During this process, the IPsec security association
between the UE and the HA is tied to the user identity, set to the NAI, and to
an SPI uniquely identifying this security association. The NAI is structured
according to 3GPP TS 23.003 [17]. The NAI can be either a root NAI, a fast re-
authentication NAI or pseudonym identity as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [17].
The UE shall use the HA-APN to identify the desired HA in the DNS-based and
DHCPv6-based HA discovery procedures. The HA-APN is constructed according to
3GPP TS 23.003 [17].
NOTE: The operator is responsible to configure the DNS system so that the same
PDN GW can be discovered via HA-APN and APN. A possible way of configuring the
mapping between HA-APN and APN is to create the HA-APN from the respective APN
by using the same Network Identifier and by adding the prefix \"ha-apn\" to
the Operator Identifier.
The Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement shall not explicitly carry an
NAI as the IPsec security association is tied to the user identity.
## 4.3 Multiple PDN connectivity
This specification supports multiple PDN connectivity. The UE can setup
multiple PDN connections with a given APN or multiple APNs using multiple
DSMIPv6 sessions. There is one DSMIPv6 session per each PDN connection.
NOTE: When UE is associated to multiple PDN connections, it is possible for
the UE to create a tunnel loop amongst the HAs by binding home addresses to
each other. This results in the possibility of HA being flooded with packets.
Packet flooding is not specific to DSMIPv6 and there exist current
implementations to deal with the packet flooding issue. As for the formation
of tunnel loop, the solution to solve it in this current specification
(Release 8) is implementation specific until a standardized solution emerges.
The procedures described in clause 5 shall be interpreted as procedures which
are executed for each PDN connection the UE established. This implies that:
\- For the initial attachment of a PDN connection, the UE shall perform a Home
Agent address discovery (subclause 5.1.2.1), a security association
establishment via IKEv2, including the EAP-AKA authentication and the IPv6
Home Network Prefix assignment (subclause 5.1.2.2), and the initial binding
registration (subclause 5.1.2.4).
\- The handover procedure shall be performed for each PDN connection
separately as described in subclause 5.2.2.
\- The re-registration procedure shall be performed for each PDN connection
separately as described in subclause 5.3.2.
\- The detach procedure shall be performed for each PDN connection separately
as described in subclause 5.4.2 or in subclause 5.4.3.
# 5 Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 Procedures
## 5.1 Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 initial attach
### 5.1.1 General
The DSMIPv6 initial attach is performed by the UE to establish a DSMIPv6
connection with the node acting as HA. This is also known as the bootstrapping
procedure as the UE establishes the security association with the HA. The
initial attach involves the following tasks:
**\- Discovery of the Home Agent address**. The UE needs to discover the IPv6
address as well as the IPv4 address of the HA.
**\- Security association establishment**. The UE needs to establish an IPsec
security association with the HA in order to secure the DSMIPv6 signalling.
IKEv2 (IETF RFC 4877 [4]) is used to establish this security association.
**\- IPv6 Home Network Prefix assignment**. The UE needs to be assigned an
IPv6 Network Prefix of its home network in order to configure the global
unicast Home Address to be used in DSMIPv6. The HA is responsible of assigning
the IPv6 Home Network Prefix to the UE.
**\- IPv4 Home Address assignment**. Optionally, a dual-stack UE can also
request to be assigned an IPv4 Home Address to be used for IPv4-only
applications. The HA is responsible of assigning the IPv4 Home Address to the
UE.
**\- Home link detection**. The UE needs to perform Home Link Detection before
initiate registration with the HA. The DSMIPv6 Home Link Detection Function is
used by the UE to detect if it is attached to the home link from a DSMIPv6
perspective.
**\- Initial binding registration**. Unless the home link detection procedure
indicates the UE is at home, the UE sends a Binding Update message to perform
its initial registration with the HA.
If the UE requires additional configuration parameters, e.g. Vendor-specific
options, stateless DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 as defined in IETF RFC 4039 [26] and IETF
RFC 3736 [13] can be run over the DSMIPv6 tunnel.
### 5.1.2 UE procedures
#### 5.1.2.1 Discovery of the Home Agent address
##### 5.1.2.1.1 General
The first procedure the UE needs to perform for DSMIPv6 initial attach is the
discovery of the node acting as the HA.
The UE can discover the IP addresses of the HA in one of the four following
ways:
\- via DNS;
\- via attach procedure for 3GPP access or trusted non-3GPP access (if
supported) based on protocol configuration options;
\- via IKEv2 during tunnel setup to ePDG for untrusted non-3GPP accesses;
\- via DHCPv6.
If the UE does not obtain the IP addresses of the HA via PCO during the 3GPP
or trusted non-3GPP (if supported) attach or via IKEv2 signalling, it shall
follow either the procedures described in subclause 5.1.2.1.5 or the
procedures described in subclause 5.1.2.1.2. The UE may be configured to
perform both procedures in parallel or one of the two procedures only in case
the other failed.
##### 5.1.2.1.2 Home agent address discovery based on DNS
A UE performing Home Agent discovery based on DNS shall support the
implementation of standard DNS mechanisms.
The UE shall perform DNS Lookup by Home Agent Name as specified in IETF RFC
5026 [10].The QNAME shall be set to the requested HA-APN. The HA-APN shall be
constructed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [17]. If a HA has both an IPv4 and
an IPv6 address, the corresponding DNS record should be configured with both
\'AAAA\' and \'A\' records. Accordingly the UE should perform one DNS lookup
procedure to retrieve both \'AAAA\' and \'A\' records. The DNS server replies
with one \'AAAA\' and one \'A\' record.
##### 5.1.2.1.3 Home agent address discovery based on protocol configuration
options
The UE may request the IPv6 address and optionally the IPv4 address of the
dual stack HA using the Protocol configuration options IE during the attach
procedure for 3GPP or trusted non-3GPP access or the additional PDN
connectivity procedure. The details of this procedure for the case of attach
for 3GPP access are described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [15]. The details of this
procedure for the case of attach for trusted non-3GPP access are described in
3GPP TS 24.302 [21].
##### 5.1.2.1.4 Home agent address discovery based on IKEv2 signalling
The UE may request the IPv6 and optionally the IPv4 address of the HA during
the tunnel establishment procedure with the ePDG. The details of this
procedure are described in 3GPP TS 24.302 [21].
##### 5.1.2.1.5 Home agent address discovery based on DHCPv6
The HA address discovery via DHCPv6 is possible in the following cases:
\- in 3GPP access, or
\- in trusted non-3GPP access, when a DHCPv6 relay exists in the trusted
non-3GPP access and the PDN GW is the DHCPv6 server, or
\- in trusted non-3GPP access, when the DHCPv6 server is in the trusted
non-3GPP access and it has the HA addresse information from static
configuration, or received via STa reference point as specified in 3GPP TS
29.273 [20].
A UE performing HA discovery based on DHCPv6 shall support the implementation
of stateless DHCPv6 as specified in IETF RFC 3736 [13] and the DHCPv6 options
as specified in IETF RFC 6610 [12].
In order to discover the address of the HA the UE shall send an Information-
Request message including the \"MIP6 Home Network ID FQDN Option\" as
described in IETF RFC 6610 [12].
NOTE: The new options described in IETF RFC 6610 [12] are applicable to
DSMIPv6.
In order to connect to a HA for a specific target PDN, the UE shall include
the desired HA-APN in the Home Network Identification FQDN field contained in
the \"MIP6 Home Network ID FQDN Option\" as described in IETF RFC 6610 [12].
The HA information is provided to the UE as described in IETF RFC 6610 [12] in
the sub-option contained in the \"MIP6 Identified Home Network Information
Option\". The sub-option can be:
\- a \"MIP6 Home Agent Address Network Information Option\" (the IPv6 address
and if available, the IPv4 address of the HA); or
\- a \"MIP6 Home Agent FQDN Network Information Option\" (the HA FQDN) as
described in IETF RFC 6610 [12].
In the latter case the UE shall perform a DNS Lookup by Home Agent Name as
specified in IETF RFC 5026 [10]. The QNAME shall be set to the received HA
FQDN.
If a HA has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, the corresponding DNS record
should be configured with both \'AAAA\' and \'A\' records. Accordingly the UE
should perform one DNS lookup procedure to retrieve both \'AAAA\' and \'A\'
records. The DNS server replies with one \'AAAA\' and one \'A\' record.
#### 5.1.2.2 Security association establishment and IPv6 Home Network Prefix
assignment
The UE shall support the IKEv2 protocol (see IETF RFC 4306 [14]) for
negotiating the IPsec security association to secure DSMIPv6 signalling and
shall support EAP over IKEv2 as described in IETF RFC 4306 [14] to perform
authentication with an AAA server. In a case an additional authentication and
authorization of the IPSec security association is needed with an external AAA
server, then the additional authentication steps during the IKEv2 exchange
shall be supported as specified in IETF RFC 4739 [23] and described in 3GPP TS
33.234 [24].
The UE shall support IPsec ESP (see IETF RFC 4303 [11]) in order to provide
authentication of Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement messages as
specified in IETF RFC 4877 [4]. The UE shall support multiple authentication
exchanges in the IKEv2 protocol as specified in IETF RFC 4739 [23] in order to
support authentication with an external AAA server. The UE shall support the
redirect mechanism as defined in IETF RFC 5685 [30].
The UE shall initiate the security association establishment procedure by
sending the IKE_SA_INIT request message defined in IETF RFC 4306 [14] to the
HA. The UE shall indicate support for the HA reallocation by including a
REDIRECT_SUPPORTED payload in the IKE_SA_INIT request as specified inIETF RFC
5685 [30]. On receipt of an IKE_SA_INIT response, the UE shall send an
IKE_AUTH request message including the MN-NAI in the IDi payload and the
Access Point Name (APN) of the target PDN the UE wants to connect to in the
IDr payload. The APN shall be formatted as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [17]. The
username part of the MN-NAI included in \"IDi\" payload may be an IMSI,
pseudonym or re-authentication ID. The UE shall include in the IDi payload the
same MN-NAI it includes in the EAP-Response/Identity within the EAP-AKA
exchange.
In the very first EAP-Response/Identity within the IKEv2 exchange the UE shall
include a NAI whose username is derived from IMSI. In subsequent exchanges the
UE should use pseudonyms and re-authentication identities provided by the 3GPP
AAA server as specified in IETF RFC 4187 [28].
NOTE: Fast reâ€‘authentication mechanism is optional, and therefore is an
implementation option in the UE and operator configuration issue (i.e. it also
depends on whether the AAA server sent a re-authentication ID during previous
EAP authentication) whether to use it during security association
establishment.
EAP-AKA over IKEv2 shall be used to authenticate UE in the IKE_AUTH exchange,
while public key signature based authentication with certificates shall be
used to authenticate the HA.
During the IKEv2 exchange, the HA may trigger the UE to perform the HA
reallocation procedure. If the UE receives as part of the IKE_AUTH response
message a REDIRECT payload containing the IP address of a target HA as
specified in subclause 5.1.3.1, the UE shall initiate a new IKEv2 security
association with the target HA. The UE shall terminate the IKEv2 security
association with the initial HA by sending an IKEv2 Informational message with
a DELETE payload as specified in IETF RFC 4306 [14].
During the IKEv2 exchange, the UE shall request the allocation of an IPv6 home
prefix through the Configuration Payload in the IKE_AUTH request message.
Since in EPS a unique IPv6 prefix is assigned to the UE, the UE shall include
a MIP6_HOME_PREFIX attribute in the CFG_REQUEST payload of the IKE_AUTH
request message as described in IETF RFC 5026 [10]. In addition the UE may
include the INTERNAL_IP6_DNS attribute in the CFG_REQUEST as described in IETF
RFC 4306 [14] to request the DNS server IPv6 address of the PLMN it is
connecting to via DSMIPv6. In the same way the UE may include the
INTERNAL_IP4_DNS attribute in the CFG_REQUEST payload to request the IPv4
address of the DNS server.
The UE shall then auto-configure a Home Address from the IPv6 prefix received
from the HA and shall run a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange to create the security
association for the new Home Address. In the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange the UE
shall include the Home Address and the appropriate selectors in the TSi
(Traffic Selector-initiator) payload to negotiate the IPsec security
association for protecting the Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement
messages as specified in IETF RFC 4877 [4].
If the UE knows the IPv6 Home Network Prefix of a PDN connection for which the
security association is to be setup, the UE shall insert a PDN Identifier
notify payload, as defined in annex B, in the IKE_AUTH request message. The
PDN Identifier notify payload shall contain the IPv6 Home Network Prefix of
the PDN connection for which the security association is being set up. If the
UE does not know the IPv6 Home Network Prefix of the PDN connection for which
the security association is to be set up, the UE shall not include the PDN
Identifier notify payload in the IKE_AUTH request message.
#### 5.1.2.3 Home Link Detection
The DSMIPv6 Home Link Detection Function is used by the UE to detect if an
access interface is on the home link for a PDN connection from a DSMIPv6
perspective. The Home Link Detection function shall be performed before
sending DSMIPv6 Binding Update via the same access interface.
To perform the Home Link Detection procedure, the UE shall compare the
assigned Home Network Prefix for a PDN connection with the IPv6 prefix or
prefixes included in the Prefix Information Option in the Router
Advertisements received on the local link. The Home Network Prefix can be
assigned in a 3GPP access via PCO, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [15], or via
IKEv2 as specified in subclause 5.1.2.2. If there is a match between the Home
Network Prefix and one of the local prefixes, the UE is attached on the home
link over the respective access interface and shall not send a Binding Update
to the HA unless the UE currently has a valid DSMIPv6 Binding Update list
entry. If the UE has a valid DSMIPv6 Binding Update list entry, the UE shall
proceed to perform the action specified in subclause 5.2.2.4. If there is not
any match, the UE shall proceed as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4.
NOTE: The UE does not need to run IKEv2 for home link detection if the Home
Network prefix is dynamically received in a PCO Information Element.
#### 5.1.2.4 Initial binding registration and IPv4 Home Address assignment
After establishing the security association and obtaining the IPv6 Home
Address, the UE shall send a Binding Update message as specified in IETF RFC
6275 [27] and IETF RFC 5555 [2] in order to register its Home Address and
Care-of Address at the HA, if it detects it is in the foreign network.
If both IPv4 and IPv6 Care-of Address are received at the foreign network, the
UE shall first attempt to use the IPv6 Care-of Address for its binding
registration. The UE shall not register both IPv4 and IPv6 Care-of Address to
its HA.
If IPv6 Care-of Address is used for initial binding registration, the UE shall
send the Binding Update message to the IPv6 address of the HA. In this Binding
Update message the H (home registration) and A (acknowledge) bits shall be
set. If the UE needs an IPv4 Home Address, the UE shall include the 0.0.0.0
address in the IPv4 Home Address option to request a dynamic IPv4 Home
Address.
When IPv6 Care-of Address is used for initial binding registration, the
Alternate Care-of Address option shall be used by the UE to carry the Care-of
Address inside a Mobility Header which is protected by ESP. If this option is
present, the address included in this option is the same address present in
the source address of the IPv6 packet.
If IPv4 Care-of Address is used for initial binding registration, the UE shall
send the Binding Update as follows (see IETF RFC 5555 [2]):
\- The IPv6 packet, with the IPv6 Home Address as the Source Address field of
the IPv6 header, shall be encapsulated in UDP.
\- The UE shall include the IPv4 Care-of Address as the Source Address field
of the IPv4 header and the HA IPv4 address as the Destination Address field of
the IPv4 header.
\- The UE shall include the IPv4 Care-of Address option containing the IPv4
Care-of Address.
\- The UE shall set the H (home registration) and A (acknowledge) flags.
\- The UE shall set the F (UDP encapsulation required) flag to 0.
\- The UE shall set the R (Mobile Router Flag) flag to 1.
\- If the UE needs an IPv4 Home Address, the UE shall include an IPv4 Home
Address option with the 0.0.0.0 address in the Binding Update message, as
defined in IETF RFC 5555 [2].
When the UE receives the Binding Acknowledgement from the HA, it shall
validate it based on the rules described in IETF RFC 6275 [27] and IETF RFC
5555 [2]. If the Binding Acknowledgement contains the successful status code 0
(\"Binding Update Accepted\"), the UE shall create an entry for the registered
Home Address in its Binding Update List and may start sending packets
containing its IPv6 Home Address or other IPv6 addresses auto-configured from
the assigned home network prefix.
If the Binding Acknowledgement contains a value of 128, the UE may re-send the
BU as specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27]. If the Binding Acknowledgement contains
a value from 129 to 133 as specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27] or a value from 140
to 143 as specified in IETF RFC 3963 [29], the UE shall not send the BU to the
HA and should discover another HA.
If the Binding Acknowledgment contains an IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option
with status code value from 0 to 127 (indicating success), the UE shall create
two entries in its Binding Update List, one for the IPv6 Home Address and
another for the IPv4 Home Address. If the Binding Acknowledgement contains an
IPv4 Address Acknowledgment option with status code indicating error (i.e. 128
or higher), the UE shall create an entry only for the IPv6 HoA in its binding
update list. Moreover, if the status code is 129 (\"Administratively
prohibited\") or 132 (\"Dynamic IPv4 home address assignment not available\"),
the UE shall not re-send the Binding Update and it shall use only the IPv6
HoA. If the Binding Acknowledgement contains an IPv4 Address Acknowledgement
option with status 128 (\"Failure, reason unspecified\"), 130 (\"Incorrect
IPv4 home address\"), 131 (\"Invalid IPv4 address\") or 133 (\"Prefix
allocation unauthorized\") it shall re-send the Binding Update including the
0.0.0.0 address in the IPv4 Home Address option. If the Binding
Acknowledgement does not contain an IPv4 Address Acknowledgment option, the UE
shall create an entry only for the IPv6 HoA in its binding update list.
NOTE: The value to be used to identify the IPv4 address acknowledgement option
in the mobility header is 30;
The UE may then send data traffic either with the IPv6 Home Address or with
the IPv4 Home Address. If the UE is located on an IP6-enabled link, it shall
send IPv6 packets as described in IETF RFC 6275 [27]; IPv4 traffic shall be
encapsulated in IPv6 packets as described in IETF RFC 5555 [2]. If the UE is
located on an IPv4-only link and the Binding Acknowledgement contains the NAT
detection option with the F flag set, the UE shall send IPv6 and IPv4 packets
following the vanilla UDP encapsulation rules specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2].
Otherwise the UE shall send IPv6 and IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv4 as
specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2].
Once the DSMIPv6 tunnel is established, the UE may build a DHCPv4 or DHCPv6
message as described in IETF RFC 4039 [26] or IETF RFC 3736 [13] respectively
and send it via the DSMIPv6 tunnel as described in IETF RFC 6275 [27] in order
to retrieve additional parameters, e.g. Vendor-specific options.
### 5.1.3 HA procedures
#### 5.1.3.1 Security association establishment and IPv6 Home Network Prefix
assignment
The HA shall support the IKEv2 protocol (see IETF RFC 4306 [14]) for
negotiating the IPsec security association to secure DSMIPv6 signalling and
shall support EAP over IKEv2 as described in IETF RFC 4306 [14] to perform UE
authentication with an AAA server. If an additional authentication and
authorization of the IPSec security association were needed with an external
AAA server, then the additional authentication steps during the IKEv2 exchange
shall be supported as specified in IETF RFC 4739 [23] and defined in 3GPP TS
33.234 [24]. The HA shall support IPsec ESP (see IETF RFC 4303 [11]) in order
to provide authentication of Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement
messages as specified in IETF RFC 4877 [4]. The HA shall support multiple
authentication exchanges in the IKEv2 protocol as specified in IETF RFC 4739
[23] in order to support authentication with an external AAA server.
The HA shall complete the IKE_SA_INIT exchange as specified in IETF RFC 4306
[14]. The HA shall include in the IDr the same value included by the UE in the
IDr payload of the request.
Upon successful authorization and authentication, the HA shall accept the
security association establishment request by sending the IKE_AUTH response
message with the CFG_REPLY payload including the IPv6 Home Network Prefix
allocated to the UE in the MIP6_HOME_PREFIX attribute. This prefix information
shall include the prefix length as specified in IETF RFC 5026 [10]. If the UE
included the INTERNAL_IP6_DNS or the INTERNAL_IP4_DNS in the CFG_REQUEST
payload, the HA shall include the same attribute in the CFG_REPLY payload
including zero or more DNS server addresses as specified in IETF RFC 4306
[14].
If the UE included a PDN Identifier notify payload within the IKE_AUTH request
message, the HA may apply the following procedure :
1) Process the PDN Identifier notify payload according to IETF RFC 4306 [14];
and
2) Use the IPv6 prefix contained in the payload to identify the PDN connection
for which the security association is being set up and
\- if the HA is able to identify the PDN connection for which the security
association is being set up, the HA shallinsert the proper IPv6 Home Network
Prefix in the MIP6_HOME_PREFIX attribute in the CFG_REPLY payload; or
\- if the HA is not able to identify the PDN connection for which the security
association is being set up, the HA shall ignore the content of the received
PDN Identifier notify payload and allocate an IPv6 Home Network Prefix as
described below.
When allocating an IPv6 Home Network Prefix, the HA shall apply one of the
following procedures:
\- If the IKEv2 message is received over an existing PDN connection, the
assigned IPv6 network prefix of the PDN connection shall be sent to the UE as
IPv6 Home Network Prefix in the MIP6_HOME_PREFIX attribute; or,
\- If the IKEv2 message is not received over an existing PDN connection, and
the UE has an existing PDN connection which has no IPSec security association
established, the assigned IPv6 network prefix of the PDN connection shall be
sent to the UE as IPv6 Home Network Prefix in the MIP6_HOME_PREFIX attribute;
or,
\- If the IKEv2 message is not received over an existing PDN connection, and
the UE does not have an existing PDN connection which has no IPSec security
association established, a new IPv6 network prefix shall be allocated and sent
to the UE as IPv6 Home Network Prefix in the MIP6_HOME_PREFIX attribute.
If the 3GPP AAA server triggers the HA to perform a HA reallocation procedure
as specified in 3GPP TS 33.402 [18], the HA learns the IP address of the
target HA as specified in 3GPP TS 29.273 [20]. The HA shall provide to the UE
the target HA IP address in the REDIRECT payload during IKE_AUTH exchange as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.402 [18]. The encoding of the REDIRECT payload in the
IKE_AUTH response message is specified in IETF RFC 5685 [30]. The HA shall not
assign an IPv6 prefix to the UE in the IKE_AUTH exchange. The HA shall remove
the states of the IKEv2 security association with the UE after receiving an
IKEv2 Informational message with a DELETE payload from the UE.
#### 5.1.3.2 Initial binding registration and IPv4 Home Address assignment
When the HA receives a Binding Update message from the UE, it shall validate
it as described in IETF RFC 6275 [27] and in IETF RFC 5555 [2]. If the
Alternate Care-of Address option is present, the HA shall verify the
correctness of the Alternate Care-of Address option. If the Care-of Address
specified in the Alternate Care-of Address option and in the Source Address
field of the IPv6 header of the Binding Update packet are different, the HA
shall reject the request by returning a Binding Acknowledgement with status
code 128. If the HA accepts the Binding Update message, it shall create a new
entry in its binding cache for UE, marking it as a home registration. The
lifetime of this binding cache entry is set based on operator\'s policies. The
HA shall not perform a Duplicate Address Detection on the IPv6 Home Address of
the UE because of the uniqueness of the IPv6 prefix assigned by the HA to the
UE. Then the HA shall send a Binding Acknowledgement with R bit set to \"1\"
as specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27] and IETF RFC 3963 [29]. The HA may include
the Binding Refresh Advice mobility option following rules defined in IETF RFC
6275 [27] to indicate the remaining time until the UE should send a new home
binding update.
If the Binding Update contains an IPv4 Home Address option with the 0.0.0.0
IPv4 address, the HA shall assign an IPv4 Home Address to the UE, including an
IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option in the Binding Acknowledgement message, as
specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2]. If no IPv4 addresses are available at the HA,
the HA shall send a Binding Acknowledgement with status code 132 in the IPv4
address acknowledgement option.
If in the received Binding Update the IPv4 Care-of Address in the IPv4 Care-of
Address option is not the same as the IPv4 address in the Source Address in
the outer IPv4 header then a NAT was in the path. This information shall be
included in the Binding Acknowledgement within a NAT Detection option with the
F flag set and the Binding Acknowledgement shall be encapsulated based on the
vanilla UDP encapsulation specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2].
If a NAT was not detected, the HA shall send the Binding Acknowledgement
without any UDP encapsulation; the message shall be encapsulated in an IPv4
header if the Care-of Address is IPv4 or in an IPv6 header if the Care-of
Address is IPv6 as specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2].
If the binding update is accepted for both IPv4 and IPv6 home addresses, the
HA creates two bindings, one for each home address as specified in IETF RFC
5555 [2]. The HA shall link the IPv4 home address binding to the IPv6 home
address binding.
NOTE: How the linkage between the two bindings (e.g. separate or single
binding cache entry) is performed is implementation specific.
When the binding cache entry is created for the UE, the HA shall tunnel all
packets destined to the IPv6 Home Address, the home network prefix and all
packets destined to the IPv4 Home Address (if present) to the UE\'s Care-of
Address. If a NAT was detected, packets shall be encapsulated in UDP and IPv4
based on vanilla UDP encapsulation specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2]. If the
Care-of Address is an IPv6 address, IPv4 and IPv6 packets shall be
encapsulated in an IPv6 header as specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27] and in IETF
RFC 5555 [2]; otherwise, if the Care-of Address is an IPv4 address, IPv4 and
IPv6 packets shall be encapsulated in an IPv4 header as specified in IETF RFC
6275 [27] and in IETF RFC 5555 [2].
#### 5.1.3.3 Binding Error message
When the HA receives a Binding Update and detects an inappropriate attempt to
use the Home Address destination option without an existing binding, or when
an unrecognized Mobility Header is received the HA shall send a Binding Error
message with appropriate status (value 1 \"Unknown binding for Home Address
destination option\" or value 2 \"Unrecognized MH Type value\") as specified
in IETF RFC 6275 [27]. The HA shall include the Home address that was
contained in the Home Address destination option.
If NAT was not detected, the HA shall send the Binding Error without any UDP
encapsulation; the message shall be encapsulated in an IPv4 header if the
Care-of Address is IPv4 or in an IPv6 header if the Care-of Address is IPv6 in
the same manner as the Binding Acknowledgement encapsulation specified in IETF
RFC 5555 [2].
If NAT was detected, the HA shall send the Binding Error encapsulated in UDP
and IPv4 based on vanilla UDP encapsulation specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2].
## 5.2 Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 handover
### 5.2.1 General
The DSMIPv6 handover procedure is performed by the UE to update its Care-of
Address at the HA after a movement between two different accesses which
implies a change of the local IP address (e.g. a movement from a 3GPP to a
non-3GPP access). When this procedure takes place, the UE has already a valid
registration at the HA, which implies that the HA has an entry in its binding
cache for that UE and a security association to secure DSMIPv6 signalling is
in place between the UE and the HA.
The procedure involves performing the Home Link Detection, setup a security
association with the HA if there is no security association existing, and the
exchange of a Binding Update and a Binding Acknowledgement between the UE and
the HA. For the handover procedure, at the previous access the UE shall
already perform discovery of the HA address, and may set up a security
association with it, as these steps are part of the initial attach procedure
described in subclause 5.1.2.
There are different handover scenarios:
\- handover from home link to a foreign link;
\- handover from a foreign link to another foreign link; and
\- handover from a foreign link to a home link.
### 5.2.2 UE procedures
#### 5.2.2.1 General
Following a change of access, the UE configures an IP address on the target
access system. The details of IP address configuration can be access specific.
The handling of the received Binding Acknowledgement is the same as specified
in subclause 5.1.2.4.
#### 5.2.2.2 Handover from home link to a foreign link
If the access network supports IPv6, as soon as the UE has received via a
Router Advertisement at least an IPv6 prefix which is not present in its
Prefix List, the UE shall perform the Home Link detection as specified in
subclause 5.1.2.3.
If the UE detects that it is moving from home link to foreign link, and if
there is no security association existing with the HA, the UE shall perform
the Security association establishment and Home Address assignment procedure
with the HA as specified in subclause 5.1.2.2.
Then the UE shall perform the initial binding registration and IPv4 Home
Address assignment as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4. In order to maintain IP
address preservation for the IPv4 address used in the home link, the UE shall
include the IPv4 address used on the home link in an IPv4 Home Address option
in the same Binding Update message.
If the UE does not have an IPv4 Home Address but wants to configure one, the
UE shall include the IPv4 Home Address option with the 0.0.0.0 address as
specified in subclause 5.1.2.4.
If the access network supports only IPv4, as soon as the UE has configured an
IPv4 Care-of Address, the UE shall send a Binding Update tunnelled in UDP as
specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2]. The UE shall set the F flag to \"0\". The UE
shall set the R flag to \"1\".
Independent of an IPv6 or IPv4 access network the UE shall set the Key
Management Capability (K) bit in the Binding Update message.
If the UE receives, as response to an outstanding binding registration, a
binding acknowledgment having a status code equal to 135 (\"Sequence number
out of window\") and a sequence number different from the one used in the
outstanding binding registration, the UE shall accept the binding
acknowledgment and process it as specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27].
#### 5.2.2.3 Handover from a foreign link to another foreign link
If the access network supports IPv6, as soon as the UE has received via a
Router Advertisement at least an IPv6 prefix which is not present in its
Prefix List, the UE shall perform the Home Link detection as specified in
subclause 5.1.2.3.
If the UE detects it is not attached to the home link, the UE shall send a
Binding Update to the HA including the newly configured IP address as the
Care-of Address in the Source IP address of the packet and optionally in the
Alternate Care-of Address Option as specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27]. The UE
build the Binding Update message as specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27].
If the UE has been assigned also an IPv4 Home Address and wants to update also
the binding for it, the UE shall include the IPv4 Home Address option
including the assigned IPv4 Home Address in the same Binding Update message.
If the UE has been assigned also an IPv4 Home Address and wants to release it,
the UE shall not include any IPv4 Home Address option in the same Binding
Update.
If the UE does not have an IPv4 Home Address but wants to configure one, the
UE shall include the IPv4 Home Address option with the 0.0.0.0 address as
specified in subclause 5.1.2.4.
If the access network supports only IPv4, as soon as the UE has configured an
IPv4 Care-of Address which is different from the previous Care-of Address, the
UE shall send a Binding Update tunnelled in UDP as specified in IETF RFC 5555
[2]. The UE shall set the F flag to \"0\". The UE shall set the R flag to
\"1\".
Independent of an IPv6 or IPv4 access network the UE shall set the Key
Management Capability (K) bit in the Binding Update message.
#### 5.2.2.4 Handover from a foreign link to a home link
If the access network supports IPv6, as soon as the UE has received via a
Router Advertisement message at least an IPv6 prefix which is not present in
its Prefix List, the UE shall perform the Home Link detection as specified in
subclause 5.1.2.3 to detect if the UE is attaching to the home link. If the UE
detects it is attached to the home link and there is a valid DSMIPv6 Binding
Update list entry at the UE, the UE shall send a Binding Update with the
Lifetime field set to \"0\" in order to remove the binding at the HA, as
specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27]. If an IPv4 home address was assigned to the
UE, as an optimization the UE may not include the IPv4 home address option as
the binding for the IPv4 home address will be removed by the HA. Independent
of an IPv6 or IPv4 access network the UE shall set the Key Management
Capability (K) bit in the de-registration Binding Update message. The UE may
preserve the IKEv2 session in order to avoid re-establishing the session when
the next handover occurs. If there is not a safe assumption that the UE will
remain in the home link (e.g. switching off the non-3GPP radio interface in
case of a dual radio terminal), the UE should preserve the IKEv2 session.
If the UE receives a Binding Revocation Indication message from the HA while
there is an outstanding unacknowledged Binding Update with Lifetime field set
to \"0\" message, the UE need not send a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement as
specified in subclause 5.4.2.1.
### 5.2.3 HA procedures
#### 5.2.3.1 Handover from home link to a foreign link
In case of UE handover from home link to foreign link, the HA shall support
the initial registrstion procedure as specified in subclause 5.1.3.
The error codes used in the Binding Acknowledgement are the same as specified
in subclause 5.1.3.2.
#### 5.2.3.2 Handover from a foreign link to another foreign link
When the HA receives a Binding Update from the UE, the HA shall validate it as
described in IETF RFC 6275 [27] and in IETF RFC 5555 [2]. If the validation is
successful, the HA shall update the binding cache entry related to the Home
Address included in the Binding Update.
If the Binding Update is an IPv6 packet, with the Alternate Care-of Address
option present, the HA shall verify the correctness of the Alternate Care-of
Address option. If the Care-of Address specified in the Alternate Care-of
Address option and in the Source Address field of the IPv6 header of the
Binding Update packet are different, the HA shall reject the request by
returning a Binding Acknowledgement with status code 128. If the option is
valid, the HA shall update the binding cache entry with the Care-of Address in
the Source Address of the IPv6 header.
If the Binding Update outer header is an IPv4 header and the IPv4 Care-of
Address in the IPv4 Care-of Address option is the same as the IPv4 address in
the Source Address in the outer IPv4 header, the HA shall update the binding
cache entry with the Care-of Address in the IPv4 Care-of Address option and
shall send a Binding Acknowledgment encapsulated in IPv4 as specified in IETF
RFC 5555 [2].
If in the received Binding Update the IPv4 Care-of Address in the IPv4 Care-of
Address option is not the same as the IPv4 address in the Source Address in
the outer IPv4 header then a NAT was in the path. This information shall be
included in the Binding Acknowledgement within a NAT Detection option with the
F bit set. The Binding Acknowledgment shall be encapsulated in UDP and the
binding cache updated as specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2].
If the Binding Update contains an IPv4 Home Address option with an IPv4 Home
Address previously assigned, the HA shall update also the binding cache entry
related to the IPv4 Home Address to the UE. If the Binding Update contains no
IPv4 Home Address option, the HA shall remove the binding cache entry related
to the IPv4 Home Address of the UE if present.
If the Binding Update contains an IPv4 Home Address option with the 0.0.0.0
IPv4 address, the HA shall assign an IPv4 Home Address to the UE, including an
IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option in the Binding Acknowledgement message.
The error codes used in the Binding Acknowledgement are the same as specified
in subclause 5.1.3.2.
If the Key Management Mobility Capability (K) bit is set in the Binding Update
and the HA supports the feature, the HA updates its IKEv2 security
associations to include the UE's Care-of Address as the peer address and the
Binding Acknowledgement is returned with the K bit set.
The HA shall set the R bit to \"1\" in the Binding Acknowledgement.
#### 5.2.3.3 Handover from a foreign link to a home link
When a UE hands over from a foreign link to its home link, a network based
mobility protocol (PMIPv6 or GTP) in the home link creates a binding cache
entry for the UE. The DSMIPv6 binding cache entry that was created by the UE
on the foreign link shall not be overwritten. The downlink UE packets shall be
processed by the HA based on the DSMIPv6 binding cache entry before the
DSMIPv6 binding cache entry is removed.
The DSMIPv6 binding cache entry shall be removed when a Binding Update with
lifetime field set to \"0\" is received by the HA from the UE. The HA shall
process the message as per IETF RFC 5555 [2] and IETF RFC 6275 [27], removing
the associated binding cache entry and sending the Binding Acknowledge message
with the Status field set to \"0\" (Binding Update accepted). If an IPv4 home
address was assigned to the UE, the HA shall also remove the binding for the
IPv4 home address tied to the IPv6 home address included in the Binding
Update.
If the HA decides to remove the DSMIPv6 binding cache entry of the UE, prior
to receiving a binding update with lifetime set to \"0\" from the UE , the HA
shall send a Binding Revocation Indication message as specified in subclause
5.4.3.1.
NOTE: As described above, if the HA receives a Binding Update with Lifetime
field set to \"0\", the HA removes the associated binding cache entry, but
additionally the HA can store some data of the binding cache entry for a
certain time in order to allow the HA to identify a delayed Binding Update
registration message arriving at the HA after the Binding Update de-
registration.
## 5.3 Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 Re-Registration
### 5.3.1 General
The DSMIPv6 Re-Registration procedure can occur at any time when the UE is
already registered at the HA. The procedure is initiated by the UE when it
wishes to extend the lifetime of an existing registration, e.g. in case the
lifetime is expiring. The procedure can also be initiated by the UE when it
wishes to request an IPv4 home address or to release the IPv4 binding while
maintaining the IPv6 binding. The procedure may also be initiated by the UE as
a mechanism to refresh the NAT bindings in order to be reachable from the HA.
NOTE: The usage of BU messages for keepalive purposes can have impacts to the
battery life of the UE. The UE can be configured to rate limiting or avoid NAT
keepalive as specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2].
### 5.3.2 UE procedures
As specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27], if the UE wants to extend the validity of
an existing binding at the HA, the UE shall send a new Binding Update to the
HA before the expiration of the lifetime indicated in the received Binding
Acknowledgement, even if it is not changing its primary Care-of Address. This
Binding Update is usually referred as periodic Binding Update.
The UE shall follow the rules described in IETF RC 6275 [27], IETF RFC 5555
[2] and in subclause 5.1.2.4 to send a periodic Binding Update and handle the
associated Binding Acknowledgement. As the UE has not performed any handover,
the UE shall confirm the already registered Care of Address and shall indicate
the desired lifetime value. In a periodic Binding Update the UE may request an
IPv4 Home Address.
If a NAT was detected and the UE is not exchanging data traffic, the UE may
send a re-registration Binding Update in order to refresh the NAT binding. The
Binding Update shall be sent with the interval contained in the Refresh Time
field of the NAT detection option received when the NAT was detected. If the
Refresh Time field was set to all 1s, the UE shall use the Binding Acknowledge
lifetime as reference interval to send NAT keepalives Binding Updates.
The UE may also send a re-registration Binding Update with the purpose of
requesting an IPv4 Home Address.
The UE may also send a re-registration Binding Update for the purpose of
releasing the IPv4 Home Address previoulsy assigned. For this purpose, the UE
shall follow the rules described in IETF RFC 5555 [2] sending a re-
registration Binding Update containing no IPv4 Home Address option.
### 5.3.3 HA procedures
When the HA receives a periodic Binding Update message from the UE, it shall
validate it as described in IETF RFC 6275 [27], IETF RFC 5555 [2] and in
subclause 5.1.3.2.
In processing a periodic Binding Update the HA shall follow the rules
described in subclause 5.1.3.2. In addition if the Binding Update does not
include the IPv4 home address option the HA shall remove any associated IPv4
binding cache entry and continue to maintain the IPv6 binding.
If the HA accepts the Binding Update message, it shall update the lifetime and
sequence number of the existing entry in its binding cache for the Home
Address. The Care-of Address is not updated as the periodic Binding Update is
not used to update the Care-of Address.
## 5.4 Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 detach
### 5.4.1 General
The DSMIPv6 detach is performed by the UE to close the DSMIPv6 session and the
respective IKEv2 session or by the network to inform the UE that it does not
have access to a specific PDN through DSMIPv6 any longer. After the DSMIPv6
detach procedure, the UE still has IP connectivity provided by the access
network.
There are two explicit detach procedures:
\- UE-initiated detach procedure: in this case the UE performs a DSMIPv6 de-
registration with the HA and closes the IKEv2 session.
\- HA-initiated detach procedure: in this case the HA informs the UE that the
DSMIPv6 binding is no more valid. The UE shall then perform the network-
initiated detach procedure.
### 5.4.2 UE procedures
#### 5.4.2.1 Network-initiated detach
Upon receiving a Binding Revocation Indication (BRI) message according to
draft-ietf-mext-binding-revocation [19] from the HA, the UE first shall
perform the required validity checks on the BRI according to IETF RFC 5846
[19].
The UE shall send a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement (BRA) as specified in
IETF RFC 5846 [19]. In this message the UE shall set the status field to
'Success' to reflect that it has received the BRI message. The BRA message may
be tunnelled in UDP or IPv4 as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4 for Binding
Update messages.
The UE then shall remove the entry identified in the BRI as deregistered from
its binding update list and shall use the procedures defined in IETF RFC 4306
[14] to remove the IPsec security associations associated with the DSMIPv6
registration as described in subclause 5.4.2.2.
#### 5.4.2.2 UE-initiated detach
To detach from a specific PDN to which it is connected through a DSMIPv6
session, the UE shall send a Binding Update with the Lifetime field set to 0
as specified in IETF RFC 6275 [27].
The UE shall use the procedures defined in the IKEv2 protocol in IETF RFC 4306
[14] to remove the IPsec security associations associated with the DSMIPv6
registration. The UE shall close the security associations associated with the
DSMIPv6 registration and instruct the HA to do the same by sending the
INFORMATIONAL request message including a DELETE payload. The Protocol ID in
the DELETE payload shall be set to \"1\" (IKE) to indicate that all IPsec ESP
security associations that were negotiated within the IKEv2 exchange shall be
deleted.
### 5.4.3 HA procedures
#### 5.4.3.1 Network-initiated detach
As soon as it receives a trigger for network-initiated detach procedure (3GPP
TS 29.273 [20]) the HA shall send a Binding Revocation Indication (BRI)
message according to IETF RFC 5846 [19] to the UE. The message shall contain
the Home Address, corresponding to the PDN connection which shall be removed.
The HA shall set the P (Proxy Binding) bit to 0 (Not Proxy MIPv6 binding), G
bit (Global) to 0 (only the PDN Connection specified by the HoA is removed)
and V bit (IPv4 HoA Binding Only) to 0 (Not to terminate the IPv4 Home Address
binding only). The revocation trigger value shall be set to 1 (Unspecified).
The HA shall include the UE home address in the Type 2 routing header as per
IETF RFC 5846 [19] and shall not include any mobility option. The BRI message
may be tunnelled in UDP or IPv4 as specified in subclause 5.1.3.2 for Binding
Acknowledgement messages.
The HA shall follow procedures according to IETF RFC 5846 [19] to await the
receipt of a Binding Revocation Acknowledgment (BRA) message from the UE.
These procedures are based on the timer MINDelayBRIs defined in IETF RFC 5846
[19]. The HA shall not remove the entry from its binding cache before
receiving the BRA.
If the HA receives a Binding Update with Lifetime set to 0 after initiating
the network-initiated detach procedure, the HA should treat the BU as
acknowledgement to the BRI for the purposes of completing the revocation
procedures that are defined in IETF RFC 5846 [19]; in this case, the HA shall
remove the respective entry in its binding cache, deleting the timer
MINDelayBRIs and respond with a Binding Acknowledgement according to IETF RFC
5555 [2] and IETF RFC 6275 [27].
#### 5.4.3.2 UE-initiated detach
When the HA receives a Binding Update with the Lifetime field set to 0, it
shall delete any existing entry for the Home Address included in the Binding
Update. Then the HA shall send a Binding Acknowledgement as specified in IETF
RFC 5555 [2] and IETF RFC 6275 [27].
On receipt of the INFORMATIONAL request message including a DELETE payload
indicating that the UE is deleting the IPsec security associations associated
with the DSMIPv6 registration, the HA shall close the IKE security
association, and all IPsec ESP security associations that were negotiated
within it towards the UE.
