##### 3 Definitions and abbreviations {#definitions-and-abbreviations .H6}
##### 3.1 Definitions {#definitions .H6}
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
**Entry point** : In the case that \"border control concepts\", as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7], are to be applied in an IM CN subsystem, then these are
to be provided by capabilities within the IBCF, and the IBCF acts as an entry
point for this network (instead of the I-CSCF). In this case the IBCF and the
I-CSCF can be co-located as a single physical node. If \"border control
concepts\" are not applied, then the I-CSCF is considered as an entry point of
a network. If the P-CSCF is in the home network, then the I-CSCF is considered
as an entry point for this document.
**Exit point** : If operator preference requires the application of \"border
control concepts\" as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7], then these are to be
provided by capabilities within the IBCF, and requests sent towards another
network are routed via a local network exit point (IBCF), which will then
forward the request to the other network (discovering the entry point if
necessary).
**Geo-local number** : Either a geo-local service number as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.228 [7] or a number in non-international format according to an
addressing plan used at the current physical location of the user.
**Home-local number** : Either a home local service number as specified in
3GPP TS 23.228 [7] or a number in non-international format according to an
addressing plan used in the home network of the user.
**Newly established set of security associations** : Two pairs of IPsec
security associations that have been created at the UE and/or the P-CSCF after
the 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request was received.
**Old set of security associations:** Two pairs of IPsec security associations
still in existence after another set of security associations has been
established due to a successful authentication procedure.
**Temporary set of security associations:** Two pairs of IPsec security
associations that have been created at the UE and/or the P-CSCF, after an
authentication challenge within a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER
request was received. The SIP level lifetime of such created security
associations will be equal to the value of reg-await-auth timer.
**Integrity protected:** See 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. Where a requirement exists
to send information \"integrity protected\" the mechanisms specified in 3GPP
TS 33.203 [19] are used for sending the information. Where a requirement
exists to check that information was received \"integrity protected\", then
the information received is checked for compliance with the procedures as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
**Instance ID:** An URN generated by the device that uniquely identifies a
specific device amongst all other devices, and does not contain any
information pertaining to the user (e.g., in GPRS instance ID applies to the
Mobile Equipment rather than the UICC). The public user identity together with
the instance ID uniquely identifies a specific UA instance.
**Resource reservation: Mechanism for reserving bearer resources that is
required for certain access technologies.**
**Local preconditions: The indication of segmented status preconditions for
the local reservation of resources as specified in RFC 3312 [30].**
**Alias SIP URI:** A URI is an alias of another URI if the treatment of both
URIs is identical, i.e. both URIs belong to the same set of implicitly
registered public user identities, and are linked to the same service profile,
and are considered to have the exact same service configuration for each and
every service.
**Initial registration:** The registration procedure for a public user
identity initiated by the UE in the absence of any valid registration.
**Re-registration:** The registration procedure initiated by the UE to refresh
or update an already existing registration for a public user identity.
**Registration of an additional public user identity:** The registration
procedure initiated by the UE to explicitly register an additional public user
identity during the life time of the registration of another registered public
user identity, where both public user identities have the same contact address
and P-CSCF.
**Emergency registration:** A special registration that relates to [binding
of]{.underline} a~~n emergency~~ public user identity [to a contact address
used for emergency service]{.underline}.
**Initial emergency registration:** An emergency registration that is also an
initial registration.
**Emergency reregistration:** An emergency registration that is also a
reregistration.
**Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA)** : As given in RFC 3261 [26]. In addition,
for the usage in the IM CN subsystem, a SIP element being able to handle a
collection of \"n\" User Agents (behaving each one as UAC and UAS, according
to SIP rules), which are linked by some application logic that is fully
independent of the SIP rules.
**UE private IP address** : It is assumed that the NAT device performs network
address translation between a private and a public network with the UE located
in the private network and the IM CN subsystem in the public network. The UE
is assumed to be configured with a private IP address. This address will be
denoted as UE private IP address.
**UE public IP address** : The NAT device is assumed to be configured with one
(or perhaps more) public address(es). When the UE sends a request towards the
public network, the NAT replaces the source address in the IP header of the
packet, which contains the UE private IP address, with a public IP addressed
assigned to the NAT. This address will be denoted as UE public IP address.
**Encapsulating UDP header** : For the purpose of performing UDP encapsulation
according to RFC 3948 [63A] each IPsec ESP packet is wrapped into an
additional UDP header. This header is denoted as E**ncapsulating UDP header**.
**Port_Uenc** : In most residential scenarios, when the NAT device performs
address translation, it also performs translation of the source port found in
the transport layer (TCP/UDP) headers. Following RFC 3948 [63A], the UE will
use port 4500 as source port in the encapsulating UDP header when sending a
packet. This port is translated by the NAT into an arbitrarily chosen port
number which is denoted as port_Uenc.
**IMS flow set:** An IMS flow set is a set of four flows as defined in draft-
ietf-outbound [92]. The flows in an IMS flow set are determined by a
combination of transport protocol, IP addresses, protected client ports and
protected server ports as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. An IMS flow set is
established by a successful IMS registration procedure.
NOTE 1: . The four flows in an IMS flow set are set up as follows:
\- Flow 1: (IP address UE, port_uc) \ (IP address P-CSCF, port_ps) over
TCP;
\- Flow 2: (IP address UE, port_uc) \ (IP address P-CSCF, port_ps) over
UDP;
\- Flow 3: (IP address UE, port_us) \ (IP address P-CSCF, port_pc) over
TCP; and
\- Flow 4: (IP address UE, port_us) \ (IP address P-CSCF, port_pc) over
UDP.
NOTE 2: According to 3GPP TS 33.203 [19], the P-CSCF can only select among
flows 1, 3, or 4 when forwarding requests towards the UE, where flow 1 is only
possible in case of TCP connection re-use. According to 3GPP TS 33.203 [19],
flow 2 is only used for UE originated requests and corresponding responses.
The P-CSCF uses flow 2 to identify the correct IMS flow set.
NOTE 3: An IMS flow set can be considered as a realisation of a logical flow
as used in draft-ietf-sip-outbound [92]. But this definition does not depend
on any particular definition of a logical flow.
**IMS flow token:** A IMS flow token is uniquely associated with a IMS flow
set. When forwarding a request destined towards the UE, the P-CSCF selects the
flow from the IMS flow set denoted by the IMS flow token as appropriate
according to 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and RFC 3261 [26].
[**Network-initiated resource reservation:** A mechanism of resource
reservation where the IP-CAN on the behalf of network initiates the resources
to the UE]{.underline}
[**Canonical form of a SIP URI** : Canoncial form of a SIP URI takes the form
\"sip:username\@domain\" as specified in RFC 3261 [26] section 10.3. SIP URI
comparisons are performed as defined in RFC 3261 [26], section
19.1.4.]{.underline}

##### 4 General {#general .H6}
##### 4.1 Conformance of IM CN subsystem entities to SIP, SDP and other
protocols {#conformance-of-im-cn-subsystem-entities-to-sip-sdp-and-other-
protocols .H6}
SIP defines a number of roles which entities can implement in order to support
capabilities. These roles are defined in annex A.
Each IM CN subsystem functional entity using an interface at the Gm reference
point, the Ma reference point, the Mg reference point, the Mi reference point,
the Mj reference point, the Mk reference point, the Mm reference point, the Mr
reference point and the Mw reference point, and also using the IP multimedia
Subsystem Service Control (ISC) Interface, shall implement SIP, as defined by
the referenced specifications in annex A, and in accordance with the
constraints and provisions specified in annex A, according to the following
roles.
The Gm reference point, the Ma reference point, the Mg reference point, the Mi
reference point, the Mj reference point, the Mk reference point, the Mm
reference point, the Mr reference point, the Mw reference point and the ISC
reference point are defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [2].
\- The User Equipment (UE) shall provide the User Agent (UA) role, with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SIP as described in subclause 5.1,
with the exceptions and additional capabilities to SDP as described in
subclause 6.1, and with the exceptions and additional capabilities to SigComp
as described in subclause 8.1. The UE shall also provide the access
~~dependent~~ [technology specific]{.underline} procedures described in [the
appropriate access technology specific annex (see subclause 3A and subclause
9.2.2)]{.underline}~~subclause B.2.2~~. [The UE may include one or several
interconnected SIP elements registered as a single logical entity when the UE
performs the functions of an external attached network (e.g. an enterprise
network). This specification does not place any constraint on the SIP role
played by each of the elements as long as the compound entity appears to the
IM CM subsystem as a SIP UA with the aforementioned exceptions and additional
capabilities except for the modifications defined by the UE performing the
functions of an external attached network modifying role in annex
A.]{.underline}
[NOTE 1: When the UE performs the functions of an external attached network
(e.g. an enterprise network), the internal structure of this UE is outside the
scope of this specification. It is expected that in the most common case,
several SIP elements will be connected to an additional element directly
attached to the IM CN subsystem.]{.underline}
\- The P‑CSCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities to SIP as described in subclause 5.2, with the exceptions and
additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.2, and with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SigComp as described in subclause
8.2. Under certain circumstances as described in subclause 5.2, the P‑CSCF
shall provide the UA role with the additional capabilities, as follows:
a) when acting as a subscriber to or the recipient of event information; and
b) when performing P‑CSCF initiated dialog-release, even when acting as a
proxy for the remainder of the dialog.
[The P-CSCF shall also provide the access technology specific procedures
described in the appropriate access technology specific annex (see subclause
3A and subclause 9.2.2).]{.underline}
\- The I-CSCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.3.
\- The S‑CCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.4, and with the exceptions and
additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.3. Under certain
circumstances as described in subclause 5.4, the S‑CCF shall provide the UA
role with the additional capabilities, as follows:
a) the S‑CCF shall also act as a registrar. When acting as a registrar, or for
the purposes of executing a third-party registration, the S‑CCF shall provide
the UA role;
b) as the notifier of event information the S‑CCF shall provide the UA role;
c) when providing a messaging mechanism by sending the MESSAGE method, the
S‑CCF shall provide the UA role; and
d) when performing S‑CCF initiated dialog release the S‑CCF shall provide the
UA role, even when acting as a proxy for the remainder of the dialog.
\- The MGCF shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.5, and with the exceptions and
additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.4.
\- The BGCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.6.
\- The AS, acting as terminating UA, or redirect server (as defined in 3GPP TS
23.218 [5] subclause 9.1.1.1), shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions
and additional capabilities as described in subclause 5.7.2, and with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.6.
\- The AS, acting as originating UA (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5]
subclause 9.1.1.2), shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions and
additional capabilities as described in subclause 5.7.3, and with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.6.
\- The AS, acting as a SIP proxy (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5] subclause
9.1.1.3), shall provided the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.7.4.
\- The AS, performing 3rd party call control (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5]
subclause 9.1.1.4), shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions and
additional capabilities as described in subclause 5.7.5, and with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.6.
NOTE [2]{.underline}~~1~~: Subclause 5.7 and its subclauses define only the
requirements on the AS that relate to SIP. Other requirements are defined in
3GPP TS 23.218 [5].
\- The AS, receiving third-party registration requests, shall provide the UA
role, with the exceptions and additional capabilities as described in
subclause 5.7.
\- The MRFC shall provide the UA role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.8, and with the exceptions and
additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.5.
\- The IBCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities to SIP as described in subclause 5.10~~, and with the exceptions
and additional capabilities to SDP as described in subclause 6.6~~. If the
IBCF provides an application level gateway functionality [(IMS-
ALG)]{.underline}, then the IBCF shall provide the UA role, with the
exceptions and additional capabilities to SIP as described in subclause 5.10,
and with the exceptions and additional capabilities to SDP as described in
subclause [6.7]{.underline}~~6.6~~. If the IBCF provides screening
functionality, then the IBCF may provide the UA role, with the exceptions and
additional capabilities to SIP as described in subclause 5.10.
\- The E-CSCF shall provide the proxy role, with the exceptions and additional
capabilities as described in subclause 5.11.
In addition to the roles specified above, the P‑CSCF, the I-CSCF, the S‑CCF,
the BGCF and the E-CSCF can act as a UA when providing server functionality to
return a final response for any of the reasons specified in RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE ~~2~~[3]{.underline}: Annex A can change the status of requirements in
referenced specifications. Particular attention is drawn to table A.4 and
table A.162 for capabilities within referenced SIP specifications, and to
table A.317 and table A.328 for capabilities within referenced SDP
specifications. The remaining tables build on these initial tables.
NOTE [4]{.underline}~~3~~: The allocated roles defined in this clause are the
starting point of the requirements from the IETF SIP specifications, and are
then the basis for the description of further requirements. Some of these
extra requirements formally change the proxy role into a B2BUA. In all other
respects other than those more completely described in subclause 5.2 the
P‑CSCF implements proxy requirements. Despite being a B2BUA a P‑CSCF does not
implement UA requirements from the IETF RFCs, except as indicated in this
specification, e.g., relating to registration event subscription.
NOTE [5]{.underline}~~4~~: Except as specified in clause 5 or otherwise
permitted in RFC 3261, the functional entities providing the proxy role are
intended to be transparent to data within received requests and responses.
Therefore these entities do not modify message bodies. If local policy applies
to restrict such data being passed on, the functional entity has to assume the
UA role and reject a request, or if in a response and where such procedures
apply, to pass the response on and then clear the session using the BYE
method.
All the above entities are functional entities that could be implemented in a
number of different physical platforms coexisting with a number of other
functional entities. The implementation shall give priority to transactions at
one functional entity, e.g. that of the E-CSCF, over non-emergency
transactions at other entities on the same physical implementation. Such
priority is similar to the priority within the functional entities themselves
specified elsewhere in this document.
Additional routeing functionality can be provided to support the ability for
the IM CN subsystem to provide transit functionality as specified in annex I.
The additional routeing functionality shall assume the proxy role.
##### 4.2 URI and address assignments {#uri-and-address-assignments .H6}
In order for SIP and SDP to operate, the following prerequisite conditions
apply:
1) I-CSCFs used in registration are allocated SIP URIs. Other IM CN subsystem
entities may be allocated SIP URIs. For example sip:pcscf.home1.net and
sip:\\@pcscf.home1.net are valid SIP URIs. If the user
part exists, it is an essential part of the address and shall not be omitted
when copying or moving the address. How these addresses are assigned to the
logical entities is up to the network operator. For example, a single SIP URI
may be assigned to all I-CSCFs, and the load shared between various physical
boxes by underlying IP capabilities, or separate SIP URIs may be assigned to
each I-CSCF, and the load shared between various physical boxes using DNS SRV
capabilities.
2) All IM CN subsystem entities are allocated IP addresses. For systems
providing access to IMS using a fixed broadband network, any IM CN Subsystem
entities can be allocated IPv4 only, IPv6 only or both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses. Otherwise, systems shall support IP addresses as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.221 [6] subclause 5.1.
3) The subscriber is allocated a private user identity by the home network
operator, and this is contained within the ISIM application, if present. Where
no ISIM application is present but USIM is present, the private user identity
is derived (see subclause 5.1.1.1A). This private user identity is available
to the SIP application within the UE. [For UEs, where neither ISIM application
nor USIM are present, the private user identity is available to the UE via
other means (see subclause 5.1.1.1B).]{.underline}
NOTE 1: The SIP URIs can be resolved by using any of public DNSs, private
DNSs, or peer-to-peer agreements.
4) The subscriber is allocated one or more public user identities by the home
network operator. The public user identity shall take the form of SIP URI as
specified in RFC 3261 [26] or tel URI as specified in RFC 3966 [22]. At least
one of the public user identities is a SIP URI and it is stored within the
ISIM application, if ISIM application is present. Where no ISIM application is
present but USIM is present, the UE derives a temporary public user identity
(see subclause 5.1.1.1A). All registered public user identities are available
to the SIP application within the UE, after registration.
5) If the UE supports GRUU (see table A.4, item A.4/53), then it shall have an
Instance ID, in conformance with the mandatory requirements for Instance IDs
specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93] and draft-ietf-sip-outbound [92].
6) For each tel URI, there is at least one alias SIP URI in the set of
implicitly registered public user identities that is used to implicitly
register the associated tel URI.
7) The public user identities may be shared across multiple UEs. A particular
public user identity may be simultaneously registered from multiple UEs that
use different private user identities and different contact addresses. When
reregistering and deregistering a given public user identity and associated
contact address, the UE will use the same private user identity that it had
used during the initial registration of the respective public user identity
and associated contact address. If the tel URI is a shared public user
identity, then the associated alias SIP URI is also a shared public user
identity. Likewise, if the alias SIP URI is a shared public user identity,
then the associated tel URI is also a shared public user identity.
8) For the purpose of access to the IM CN subsystem, UEs are assigned IPv6
prefixes in accordance with the constraints specified in 3GPP TS 23.221 [6]
subclause 5.1 (see subclause 9.2.1 for the assignment procedures). In the
particular case of UEs accessing the IMS using a fixed broadband
interconnection, UEs can be allocated IPv4 only, IPv6 only or both IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses.
[9]{.underline}) ~~For the purpose of emergency service, the UE shall use at
least an emergency public user identity, which is a SIP URI derived as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3] and an associated tel URI.~~
~~10)~~ For the purpose of indicating an IMS communication service to the
network, UEs are assigned ~~IMS communication service identifier (~~ICSI~~)~~
values [appropriate to the IMS communication services supported by the
UE,]{.underline} coded as URN as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2. ~~An ICSI
identifies a service, e.g. media and service characteristics, and is used by
the S-CSCF and third party AS for the purposes of authorisation and providing
service procedures. The UE can send and receive ICSI values in SIP signalling
to indicate the related IMS communication service.~~
##### 4.2A Transport mechanisms {#a-transport-mechanisms .H6}
This document makes no requirement on the transport protocol used to transfer
signalling information over and above that specified in RFC 3261 [26] clause
18. However, the UE and IM CN subsystem entities shall transport SIP messages
longer than 1300 bytes according to the procedures of RFC 3261 [26] subclause
18.1.1, even if a mechanism exists of discovering a maximum transmission unit
size longer than 1500 bytes.
NOTE 1: Support of SCTP as specified in RFC 4168 [96] is optional for IM CN
subsystem entities implementing the role of a UA or proxy. SCTP transport
between the UE and P‑CSCF is not supported in the present document. Support of
the SCTP transport is currently not described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
For initial REGISTER requests, the UE and the P‑CSCF shall apply port handling
according to subclause 5.1.1.2 [(or subclause 5.1.1.2A)]{.underline} and
subclause 5.2.2 [(or subclause 5.2.2A)]{.underline}.
[When a security association is used to access the IM CN
subsystem,]{.underline} the UE and the P‑CSCF shall send and receive request
and responses other than initial REGISTER requests on the protected ports as
described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. [For UEs loaded with a ISIM or USIM, the
security association shall always be used to access the IM CN subsystem as
described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].]{.underline}
[NOTE 2: The usage of NASS-bundled authentication, which provides for the user
authentication without creation of a security association, still requires
convergence with equivalent 3GPP documents, along with ensuring
interoperability and coexistence with other security mechanisms. This will be
addressed in a future version of this document, and may introduce some
revision of the procedures.]{.underline}
In case of an emergency session if the UE does not have sufficient credentials
to authenticate with the IM CN subsystem and regulations allow, the UE and
P‑CSCF shall send request and responses other than initial REGISTER requests
on non protected ports.
###### 4.4.4 History-Info
A functional entity at the boundary of the trust domain will need to determine
whether to remove the History-Info header according to RFC 4244
[[66]{.underline}~~34~~] subclause 3.3 when SIP signalling crosses the
boundary of the trust domain. Subclause 5.4 identifies additional cases for
the removal of the History-Info header.

on network policies, for a non-roaming UE an emergency call attempt can
succeed even if the UE did not detect that an emergency session is being
requested, otherwise the network rejects the request indicating to the UE that
the attempt was for an emergency service.]{.underline}

##### 5 Application usage of SIP {#application-usage-of-sip .H6}
#### 5.1.1.1 General
The UE shall register public user identities (see table A.4/1 and dependencies
on that major capability).
**The UE shall use one IP address for all SIP signalling, i.e. simultaneous
registration using different IP addresses from the same UE is not supported in
this release of this document. The only exception is a possible parallel
emergency registration as described in subclause 5.1.6.**
NOTE: The UE can use multiple Contact header parameter values simultanously,
provided they all contain the same IP address and port number.
~~The UE shall register and deregister only its public user identities with
the associated contact address that belong to the UE.~~
In case a UE registers several public user identities at different points in
time, the procedures to re-register, deregister and subscribe to the
registration-state event package for these public user identities can remain
uncoordinated in time.
In case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided
by a NA(P)T or NA(P)T-PT, the UE may need to modify the SIP contents according
to the procedures described in either annex F or annex K.
##### 5.1.1.1A Parameters contained in the ISIM {#a-parameters-contained-in-
the-isim .H6}
[This subclause applies when a UE contains either an ISIM or a
USIM.]{.underline}
The ISIM application shall always be used for IMS authentication, if it is
present, as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
The ISIM is preconfigured with all the necessary parameters to initiate the
registration to the IM CN subsystem. These parameters include:
\- the private user identity;
\- one or more public user identities; and
\- the home network domain name used to address the SIP REGISTER request
In case the UE is loaded with a UICC that does not contain the ISIM
application, the UE shall:
\- generate a private user identity;
\- generate a temporary public user identity; and
\- generate a home network domain name to address the SIP REGISTER request to;
in accordance with the procedures in clause C.2.
The temporary public user identity is only used in REGISTER requests, i.e.
initial registration, re-registration, UE-initiated deregistration. The UE
shall not reveal to the user the temporary public user identity if the
temporary public user identity is barred. The temporary public user identity
is not barred if received by the UE in the P-Associated-URI header.
If the UE is unable to derive the parameters in this subclause for any reason,
then the UE shall not proceed with the request associated with the use of
these parameters and will not be able to register to the IM CN subsystem.
##### [5.1.1.1B Parameters provisioned to a UE without ISIM or
USIM]{.underline} {#b-parameters-provisioned-to-a-ue-without-isim-or-usim .H6}
[In case the UE contains neither a ISIM application nor a USIM, the parameters
used by the UE to initiate the registration to the IM CN subsystem and for
authentication shall be preconfigured in accordance with clause
C.4.]{.underline}
##### 5.1.1.2 Initial registration (with security association setup)
{#initial-registration-with-security-association-setup .H6}
The initial registration procedure consists of the UE sending an unprotected
initial REGISTER request and, upon being challenged, sending the integrity
protected REGISTER request. The UE can register a public user identity with
its contact address at any time after it has acquired an IP address,
discovered a P‑CSCF, and established an IP‑CAN bearer that can be used for SIP
signalling. However, the UE shall only initiate a new registration procedure
when it has received a final response from the registrar for the ongoing
registration, or the previous REGISTER request has timed out.
When registering any public user identity [and the registration is not
triggered by the re-authentication procedure as specified in subclause
5.1.1.5.1 and 5.4.1.6]{.underline}, if the UE has an already active pair of
security associations, then it shall use them to protect the REGISTER
requests.
If the UE detects that the existing security associations are no longer active
(e.g., after receiving no response to several protected messages), the UE
shall:
\- consider all previously registered public user identities as deregistered;
and
\- stop processing all associated ongoing dialogs and transactions, if any
(i.e. no further SIP signalling will be sent by the UE on behalf of these
transactions or dialogs).
The UE shall send only the initial REGISTER requests to the port advertised to
the UE during the P‑CSCF discovery procedure. If the UE does not receive any
specific port information during the P‑CSCF discovery procedure, the UE shall
send the initial REGISTER request to the SIP default port values as specified
in RFC 3261 [26].
The UE shall extract or derive a public user identity, the private user
identity, and the domain name to be used in the Request-URI in the
registration, according to the procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.1A. A
public user identity may be input by the end user.
On sending a REGISTER request, the UE shall populate the header fields as
follows:
a) an Authorization header, with:
\- the username field, set to the value of the private user identity;
\- the realm directive, set to the domain name of the home network;
\- the uri directive, set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home
network;
\- the nonce directive, set to an empty value; and
\- the response directive, set to an empty value;
b) a From header set to the SIP URI that contains the public user identity to
be registered;
c) a To header set to the SIP URI that contains the public user identity to be
registered;
d) a Contact header set to include SIP URI(s) containing the IP address of the
UE in the hostport parameter or FQDN. If the UE supports GRUU (see table A.4,
item A.4/53), it shall include a +sip.instance parameter containing the
instance ID. The UE shall include all supported ICSI values (coded as
specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) [in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag as defined
in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62] for the IMS communication services it
intends to use]{.underline}, and IARI values (coded as specified in subclause
7.2A.9.2), for the IMS communication services and IMS applications it intends
to use in a [g.3gpp.iari-ref feature tag as defined in subclause
7.9.3]{.underline} ~~sip.app-subtype feature tag according to draft-rosenberg-
sip-app-media-tag [120]~~ and RFC 3840 [62]. If the REGISTER request is
protected by a security association, the UE shall also include the protected
server port value in the hostport parameter;
e) a Via header set to include the IP address or FQDN of the UE in the sent-by
field. For the UDP, if the REGISTER request is protected by a security
association, the UE shall also include the protected server port value in the
sent-by field, while for the TCP, the response is received on the TCP
connection on which the request was sent;
NOTE 1: If the UE specifies its FQDN in the host parameter in the Contact
header and in the sent-by field in the Via header, then it has to ensure that
the given FQDN will resolve (e.g., by reverse DNS lookup) to the IP address
that is bound to the security association.
NOTE 2: The UE associates two ports, a protected client port and a protected
server port, with each pair of security association. For details on the
selection of the port values see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
f) an Expires header, or the expires parameter within the Contact header, set
to the value of 600 000 seconds as the value desired for the duration of the
registration;
NOTE 3: The registrar (S‑CCF) might decrease the duration of the registration
in accordance with network policy. Registration attempts with a registration
period of less than a predefined minimum value defined in the registrar will
be rejected with a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
g) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home network;
h) the Security-Client header field set to specify the security mechanism the
UE supports, the IPsec layer algorithms the UE supports and the parameters
needed for the security association setup. The UE shall support the setup of
two pairs of security associations as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The
syntax of the parameters needed for the security association setup is
specified in annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The UE shall support the
\"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48]. The UE shall
support the IPsec layer algorithms for integrity and confidentiality
protection as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and shall announce support for
them according to the procedures defined in RFC 3329 [48];
i) the Supported header containing the option tag \"path\", and if GRUU is
supported, the option tag \"gruu\"; and
j) if a security association exists, and if available to the UE (as defined in
the access technology specific annexes for each access technology), a
P-Access-Network-Info header set as specified for the access network
technology (see subclause 7.2A.4).
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the UE shall:
a) store the expiration time of the registration for the public user
identities found in the To header value;
b) store as the default public user identity the first URI on the list of URIs
present in the P-Associated-URI header;
> NOTE 4: The UE can utilize additional URIs contained in the P-Associated-URI
> header, e.g. for application purposes.
c) treat the identity under registration as a barred public user identity, if
it is not included in the\ P-Associated-URI header;
d) store the list of Service-Route headers contained in the Service-Route
header, in order to build a proper preloaded Route header value for new
dialogs and standalone transactions;
e) set the security association lifetime to the longest of either the
previously existing security association lifetime (if available), or the
lifetime of the just completed registration plus 30 seconds; and
NOTE 5: If the UE receives Authentication-Info, it will proceed as described
in RFC 3310 [49].
f) find the Contact header within the response that matches the one included
in the REGISTER request. If this contains a \"pub-gruu\" parameter or a
\"temp-gruu\" parameter or both, and the UE supports GRUU (see table A.4, item
A.4/53), then store the value of those parameters as the GRUUs for the UE in
association with the public user identity that was registered.
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER is received the UE shall
behave as described in subclause 5.1.1.5.1.
On receiving a 305 (Use Proxy) response to the initial REGISTER request, the
UE shall:
a) release all IP‑CAN bearers used for the transport of media according to the
procedures in subclause 9.2.2;
b) initiate a new P‑CSCF discovery procedure as described in subclause 9.2.1;
c) select a P‑CSCF address, which is different from the previously used
address, from the address list; and
d) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
5.1.1.2.
[On receiving the 420 (Bad Extension) response with the Unsupported header
containing the option tag "sec-agree" to the REGISTER request, the UE may send
another REGISTER request without a security association based on the
procedures described in 5.1.1.2A. The decision may depend on the UE\'s
capability.]{.underline}
On receiving a 423 (Interval Too Brief) too brief response to the REGISTER
request, the UE shall:
\- send another REGISTER request populating the Expires header or the expires
parameter with an expiration timer of at least the value received in the Min-
Expires header of the 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
On receiving a 408 (Request Timeout) response or 500 (Server Internal Error)
response or 504 (Server Time-Out) or 600 (Busy Everywhere) response for an
initial registration, the UE may attempt to perform initial registration
again.
When the timer F expires at the UE, the UE may:
a) select a different P‑CSCF address from the list of P‑CSCF addresses
discovered during the procedures described in subclause 9.2.1;
b) if no response has been received when attempting to contact all P‑CSCFs
known by the UE, the UE may get a new set of P‑CSCF-addresses as described in
subclause 9.2.1; and
c) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
5.1.1.2.
NOTE 6: It is an implementation option whether these actions are also
triggered by other means than expiration of timer F, e.g. based on ICMP
messages.
After a maximum of 5 consecutive unsuccessful initial registration attempts,
the UE shall not automatically attempt any further initial registration via
the same network and the same P‑CSCF, for an implementation dependant time of
at least:
a) the amount of time indicated in the Retry-After header of the 4xx, 5xx, or
6xx response received in response to the most recent registration request, if
that header was present; or
b) 30 minutes, if the header was not present and the initial registration was
automatically performed as a consequence of a failed reregistration; or
c) 5 minutes, if the header was not present and the initial registration was
not performed as a consequence of a failed reregistration.
These limits do not apply if the UE is power cycled.

either the default public user identity or the public user identity used for
initial registration for the subscription to the registration-state event
package, if the initial public user identity that was used for initial
registration is not barred.
On sending a SUBSCRIBE request, the UE shall populate the header fields as
follows:
a) a Request URI set to the resource to which the UE wants to be subscribed
to, i.e. to a SIP URI that contains the public user identity used for
subscription;
b) a From header set to a SIP URI that contains the public user identity used
for subscription;
c) a To header set to a SIP URI that contains the public user identity used
for subscription;
d) an Event header set to the \"reg\" event package;
e) an Expires header set to 600 000 seconds as the value desired for the
duration of the subscription
f) if available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology), a P‑Access-Network-Info header set as
specified for the access network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4); and
g) a Contact header set to contain the same IP address or FQDN, and [when a
security association exists]{.underline} with the protected server port value
as in the initial registration.
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the SUBSCRIBE request, the UE shall store
the information for the established dialog and the expiration time as
indicated in the Expires header of the received response.
If continued subscription is required, the UE shall automatically refresh the
subscription by the reg event package, for a previously registered public user
identity, either 600 seconds before the expiration time if the initial
subscription was for greater than 1200 seconds, or when half of the time has
expired if the initial subscription was for 1200 seconds or less. If a
SUBSCRIBE request to refresh a subscription fails with a non-481 response, the
UE shall still consider the original subscription valid for the duration of
the most recently known \"Expires\" value according to RFC 3265 [28].
Otherwise, the UE shall consider the subscription invalid and start a new
initial subscription according to RFC 3265 [28].
##### 5.1.1.4 User-initiated re-registration and registration of an additional
public user identity [(with security association)]{.underline} {#user-
initiated-re-registration-and-registration-of-an-additional-public-user-

The UE can perform the reregistration of a previously registered public user
identity with its contact address at any time after the initial registration
has been completed. The UE shall perform the reregistration over the existing
set of security associations that is associated with the related contact
address.
The UE can perform registration of additional public user identities at any
time after the initial registration has been completed. The UE shall perform
the registration of additional public user identities over the existing set of
security associations that is associated with the related contact address.
Unless either the user or the application within the UE has determined that a
continued registration is not required the UE shall reregister an already
registered public user identity either 600 seconds before the expiration time
if the previous registration was for greater than 1200 seconds, or when half
of the time has expired if the initial registration was for 1200 seconds or
less, or when the UE intends to update its capabilities according to RFC 3840
[62] or when the UE needs to modify the ICSI values [that the UE intends to
use in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag]{.underline} or IARI values that the UE
intends to use in the g.3gpp.iari-ref ~~sip.app-subtype~~ feature tag.
The UE shall protect the REGISTER request using a security association, see
3GPP TS 33.203 [19], established as a result of an earlier registration, if
one is available.
The UE shall extract or derive a public user identity, the private user
identity, and the domain name to be used in the Request-URI in the
registration, according to the procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.1A.
On sending a REGISTER request that does not contain a challenge response, the
UE shall populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header, with:
\- the username directive set to the value of the private user identity;
\- the realm directive, set to the value as received in the realm directive in
the WWW Authenticate header;
\- the uri directive, set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home
network;
\- the nonce directive, set to last received nonce value; and
\- the response directive, set to the last calculated response value;
b) a From header set to the SIP URI that contains the public user identity to
be registered;
c) a To header set to the SIP URI that contains the public user identity to be
registered;
d) a Contact header set to include SIP URI(s) that contain(s) in the hostport
parameter the IP address of the UE or FQDN and protected server port value
bound to the security association, and containing the instance ID of the UE in
the +sip.instance parameter, if the UE supports GRUU (see table A.4, item
A.4/53). The UE shall include all supported ICSI values (coded as specified in
subclause 7.2A.8.2) [in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag as defined in subclause
7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62] for the IMS communication it intends to

to draft-rosenberg-sip-app-media-tag [120]~~ [as defined in subclause
7.9.3]{.underline} and RFC 3840 [62];
e) a Via header set to include the IP address or FQDN of the UE in the sent-by
field and for the UDP the protected server port value bound to the security
association, while for the TCP, the response is received on the TCP connection
on which the request was sent;
NOTE 1: If the UE specifies its FQDN in the host parameter in the Contact
header and in the sent-by field in the Via header, then it has to ensure that
the given FQDN will resolve (e.g., by reverse DNS lookup) to the IP address
that is bound to the security association.
NOTE 2: The UE associates two ports, a protected client port and a protected
server port, with each pair of security associations. For details on the
selection of the protected port value see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
f) an Expires header, or an expires parameter within the Contact header, set
to 600 000 seconds as the value desired for the duration of the registration;
NOTE 3: The registrar (S‑CCF) might decrease the duration of the registration
in accordance with network policy. Registration attempts with a registration
period of less than a predefined minimum value defined in the registrar will
be rejected with a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
g) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home network;
h) a Security-Client header field, set to specify the security mechanism it
supports, the IPsec layer algorithms for security and confidentiality
protection it supports and the new parameter values needed for the setup of
two new pairs of security associations. For further details see 3GPP TS 33.203
[19] and RFC 3329 [48];
i) a Security-Verify header that contains the content of the Security-Server
header received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response of the last successful
authentication;
j) the Supported header containing the option tag \"path\", and if GRUU is
supported, the option tag \"gruu\"; and
k) if available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology), a P‑Access-Network-Info header set as
specified for the access network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4).
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the UE shall:
a) store the new expiration time of the registration for this public user
identity found in the To header value;
b) store the list of Service-Route headers contained in the Service-Route
header, in order to build a proper preloaded Route header value for new
dialogs and standalone transactions;

c) set the security association lifetime to the longest of either the
previously existing security association lifetime, or the lifetime of the just
completed registration plus 30 seconds; and
NOTE 5: If the UE receives Authentication-Info, it will proceed as described
in RFC 3310 [49].
d) find the Contact header within the response that matches the one included
in the REGISTER request. If this contains a \"pub-gruu\" parameter or a
\"temp-gruu\" parameter or both, and the UE supports GRUU (see table A.4, item
A.4/53), then store the value of those parameters as the GRUUs for the UE in
association with the public user identity that was registered.

Expires header of the 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
On receiving a 408 (Request Timeout) response or 500 (Server Internal Error)
response or 504 (Server Time-Out) response for a reregistration, the UE shall
perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
5.1.1.2.
On receiving a 305 (Use Proxy) response to the REGISTER request, the UE shall:
a) release all IP‑CAN bearers used for the transport of media according to the
procedures in subclause 9.2.2;
b) initiate a new P‑CSCF discovery procedure as described in subclause 9.2.1;
c) select a P‑CSCF address, which is different from the previously used
address, from the address list; and
d) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
5.1.1.2.
When the timer F expires at the UE, the UE shall:
1) stop processing of all ongoing dialogs and transactions and silently
discard them locally; and
2) after releasing all IP‑CAN bearers used for the transport of media
according to the procedures in subclause 9.2.2, the UE may:
a) select a different P‑CSCF address from the list of P‑CSCF addresses
discovered during the procedures described in subclause 9.2.1;
b) if no response has been received when attempting to contact all P‑CSCFs
known by the UE, the UE may get a new set of P‑CSCF-addresses as described in
subclause 9.2.1; and
c) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause

##### 5.1.1.5.1 General {#general-2 .H6}
Authentication is performed during initial registration [as defined in
subclause 5.1.1.2]{.underline}. A UE can be re-authenticated during subsequent
re-registration s, deregistrations or registrations of additional public user
identities [as defined in subclause 5.1.1.4]{.underline}. When the network
requires authentication or re-authentication of the UE, the UE will receive a
401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request.
On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request, the UE
shall:
1) extract the RAND and AUTN parameters;
2) check the validity of a received authentication challenge, as described in
3GPP TS 33.203 [19] i.e. the locally calculated XMAC must match the MAC
parameter derived from the AUTN part of the challenge; and the SQN parameter
derived from the AUTN part of the challenge must be within the correct range;
and
3) check the existence of the Security-Server header as described in RFC 3329
[48]. If the header is not present or it does not contain the parameters
required for the setup of the set of security associations (see annex H of
3GPP TS 33.203 [19]), the UE shall abandon the authentication procedure and
send a new REGISTER request with a new Call-ID.
In the case that the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request is
deemed to be valid the UE shall:
1) calculate the RES parameter and derive the keys CK and IK from RAND as
described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19];
2) set up a temporary set of security associations based on the static list
and parameters it received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response and its
capabilities sent in the Security-Client header in the REGISTER request. The
UE sets up the temporary set of security associations using the most preferred
mechanism and algorithm returned by the P‑CSCF and supported by the UE and
using IK and CK (only if encryption enabled) as the shared key. The UE shall
use the parameters received in the Security-Server header to setup the
temporary set of security associations. The UE shall set a temporary SIP level
lifetime for the temporary set of security associations to the value of reg-
await-auth timer; and
3) send another REGISTER request using the temporary set of security
associations to protect the message. The header fields are populated as
defined for the initial request, with the addition that the UE shall include
an Authorization header containing[:]{.underline}
[- the]{.underline} realm directive set to the value as received in the realm
directive in the WWW Authenticate header[;]{.underline}
[- the username directive, set to the value of]{.underline} , the private user
identity[;]{.underline} ~~and~~
[- the response directive that contains]{.underline} ~~the authentication
challenge response calculated by the UE using~~ RES ~~and other~~ parameters,
as described in RFC 3310 [49][;]{.underline}
[- the uri directive, set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home
network;]{.underline}
[- the **algorithm directive,** set to the value received in the 401
(Unauthorized) response; and]{.underline}
[- the nonce directive, set to the value received in the 401 (Unauthorized)
response]{.underline}.
The UE shall also insert the\ Security-Client header that is identical to the
Security-Client header that was included in the previous REGISTER request
(i.e. the REGISTER request that was challenged with the received 401
(Unauthorized) response). The UE shall also insert the Security-Verify header
into the request, by mirroring in it the content of the Security-Server header
received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response. The UE shall set the Call-ID of
the security association protected REGISTER request which carries the
authentication challenge response to the same value as the Call-ID of the 401
(Unauthorized) response which carried the challenge.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response for the security association protected
REGISTER request, the UE shall:
\- change the temporary set of security associations to a newly established
set of security associations, i.e. set its SIP level lifetime to the longest
of either the previously existing set of security associations SIP level
lifetime, or the lifetime of the just completed registration plus 30 seconds;
and
\- use the newly established set of security associations for further messages
sent towards the P‑CSCF as appropriate.
NOTE 1: In this case, the UE will send requests towards the P‑CSCF over the
newly established set of security associations. Responses towards the P‑CSCF
that are sent via UDP will be sent over the newly established set of security
associations. Responses towards the P‑CSCF that are sent via TCP will be sent
over the same set of security associations that the related request was
received on.
When the first request or response protected with the newly established set of
security associations is received from the P‑CSCF, the UE shall delete the old
set of security associations and related keys it may have with the P‑CSCF
after all SIP transactions that use the old set of security associations are
completed.
Whenever the 200 (OK) response is not received before the temporary SIP level
lifetime of the temporary set of security associations expires or a 403
(Forbidden) response is received, the UE shall consider the registration to
have failed. The UE shall delete the temporary set of security associations it
was trying to establish, and use the old set of security associations. The UE
should send an unprotected REGISTER message according to the procedure
specified in subclause 5.1.1.2 if the UE considers the old set of security
associations to be no longer active at the P‑CSCF.
In the case that the 401 (Unauthorized) response is deemed to be invalid then
the UE shall behave as defined in subclause 5.1.1.5.3.
##### [5.1.1.5.1A NASS-bundled authentication]{.underline} {#a-nass-bundled-
authentication .H6}
[NASS-bundled authentication is only applicable to UEs that contain neither
USIM nor ISIM. Authentication is achieved via the registration and re-
registration procedures as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2A and subclause
5.1.1.4A.\ NASS-bundled authentication is granted by the network upon receipt
by the UE of a 200 (OK) response to the initial REGISTER request.]{.underline}
##### 5.1.1.5.2 Network-initiated re-authentication {#network-initiated-re-
authentication .H6}
At any time, the UE can receive a NOTIFY request carrying information related
to the reg event package (as described in subclause 5.1.1.3). If:
\- the state attribute in any of the \ elements is set to
\"active\";
\- the value of the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element is
set to the Contact address that the UE registered; and
\- the event attribute of that \ sub-element(s) is set to
\"shortened\";
the UE shall:
1) use the expiry attribute within the \ sub-element that the UE
registered to adjust the expiration time for that public user identity; and
2) start the re-authentication procedures at the appropriate time (as a result
of the S‑CCF procedure described in subclause 5.4.1.6) by initiating a
reregistration as described in subclause 5.1.1.4, [or subclause 5.1.1.4A if
those procedures were performed for the initial authentication,]{.underline}
if required.
NOTE: When authenticating a given private user identity, the S‑CCF will only
shorten the expiry time within the \ sub-element that the UE
registered using its private user identity. The \ elements for the
same public user identity, if registered by another UE using different private
user identities remain unchanged. The UE will not initiate a reregistration
procedure, if none of its \ sub-elements was modified.
##### 5.1.1.5A Change of Ipv6 address due to privacy {#a-change-of-
ipv6-address-due-to-privacy .H6}
Stateless address autoconfiguration as described in RFC 2462 [20E] defines how
an IPv6 prefix and an interface identifier is used by the UE to construct a
complete IPv6 address.
If the UE receives an IPv6 prefix, the UE may change the interface identity of
the IPv6 address as described in RFC 3041 [25A] due to privacy but this will
result in service discontinuity for IMS services.
NOTE: The procedure described below will terminate all established dialogs and
transactions and temporarily disconnect the UE from the IM CN subsystem until
the new registration is performed. Due to this, the UE is recommended to
provide a limited use of the procedure to ensure a maximum degree of
continuous service to the end user.
In order to change the IPv6 address due to privacy, the UE shall:
1) terminate all ongoing dialogs (e.g., sessions) and transactions (e.g.,
subscription to the reg event);
2) deregister all registered public user identities as described in subclause
5.1.1.6 [or subclause 5.1.1.6A as appropriate to the authentication mechanism
in use]{.underline};
3) construct a new IPv6 address according to the procedures specified in RFC
3041 [25A];
4) register the public user identities that were deregistered in step 2 above,
as follows:
a) by performing an initial registration as described in subclause 5.1.1.2 [or
subclause 5.1.1.2A as appropriate to the authentication mechanism in
use]{.underline}; and
b) by performing a subscription to the reg event package as described in
subclause 5.1.1.3; and
5) subscribe to other event packages it was subscribed to before the change of
IPv6 address procedure started.
##### 5.1.1.6 User-initiated deregistration [(with security
association)]{.underline} {#user-initiated-deregistration-with-security-
association .H6}
The UE can deregister a public user identity that it has previously registered
with its contact address at any time.
The UE shall protect the REGISTER request using a security association, see
3GPP TS 33.203 [19], established as a result of an earlier registration, if
one is available.
The UE shall extract or derive a public user identity, the private user
identity, and the domain name to be used in the Request-URI in the
registration, according to the procedures described in subclause 5.1.1.1A.
Prior to sending a REGISTER request for deregistration, the UE shall release
all dialogs related to the public user identity that is going to be
deregistered or to one of the implicitly registered public user identities
However:
\- if the dialog that was established by the UE subscribing to the reg event
package used the public user identity that is going to be deregistered; and
\- this dialog is the only remaining dialog used for subscription to reg event
package;
then the UE shall not release this dialog.
On sending a REGISTER request, the UE shall populate the header fields as
follows:
a) an Authorization header, with:
\- the username directive, set to the value of the private user identity;
\- the realm directive, set to the value as received in the realm directive in
the WWW-Authenticate header;
\- the uri directive, set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home
network;
\- the nonce directive, set to last received nonce value; and
\- the response directive, set to the last calculated response value;
b) a From header set to the SIP URI that contains the public user identity to
be deregistered;
c) a To header set to the SIP URI that contains the public user identity to be
deregistered;
d) a Contact header set to either the value of \"*\" or SIP URI(s) that
contain(s) in the hostport parameter the IP address of the UE or FQDN and the
protected server port value bound to the security association, and containing
the Instance ID of the UE in the +sip.instance parameter, if the UE supports
GRUU (see table A.4, item A.4/53);
e) a Via header set to include the IP address or FQDN of the UE in the sent-by
field and the protected server port value bound to the security association;
NOTE 1: If the UE specifies its FQDN in the host parameter in the Contact
header and in the sent-by field in the Via header, then it has to ensure that
the given FQDN will resolve (e.g., by reverse DNS lookup) to the IP address
that is bound to the security association.
f) an Expires header, or the expires parameter of the Contact header, set to
the value of zero, appropriate to the deregistration requirements of the user;
g) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home network;
h) a Security-Client header field, set to specify the security mechanism it
supports, the IPsec layer algorithms for integrity and confidentiality
protection it supports and the new parameter values needed for the setup of
two new pairs of security associations. For further details see 3GPP TS 33.203
[19] and RFC 3329 [48];
i) a Security-Verify header that contains the content of the Security-Server
header received in the 401 (Unauthorized) response of the last successful
authentication; and
j) if available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology), a P‑Access-Network-Info header set as
specified for the access network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4).
When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER request is received the UE
shall behave as described in subclause 5.1.1.5.1.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the UE shall
remove all registration details relating to this public user identity.
If there are no more public user identities registered, the UE shall delete
the security associations and related keys it may have towards the IM CN
subsystem.
If all public user identities are deregistered and the security association is
removed, then the UE shall consider subscription to the reg event package
cancelled (i.e. as if the UE had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires
header containing a value of zero).
NOTE 2: When the UE has received the 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER
request of the only public user identity currently registered with its
associated set of implicitly registered public user identities (i.e. no other
is registered), the UE removes the security association established between
the P‑CSCF and the UE. Therefore further SIP signalling (e.g. the NOTIFY
request containing the deregistration event) will not reach the UE.

###### 5.1.2.1 Notification about multiple registered public user identities
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the SUBSCRIBE request the UE shall maintain
the generated dialog (identified by the values of the Call-ID
[header]{.underline}, [and the values of tags in]{.underline} To and From
headers).
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription to the reg event package the UE shall perform the following
actions:
\- if a state attribute \"active\", i.e. registered is received for one or
more public user identities, the UE shall store the indicated public user
identities as registered;
\- if a state attribute \"active\" is received, and the UE supports GRUU (see

notification that contains a \ element or a \ element or
both (as defined in draft-ietf-sipping-gruu-reg-event [94]) then the UE shall
store the value of those elements in association with the public user
identity;
\- if a state attribute \"terminated\", i.e. deregistered is received for one
or more public user identities, the UE shall store the indicated public user
identities as deregistered and shall remove any associated GRUUs.
NOTE[ 1]{.underline}: There may be public user identities which are
automatically registered within the registrar (S-CSCF) of the user upon
registration of one public user identity or when S-CSCF receives a Push-
Profile-Request (PPR) from the HSS (as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14])
changing the status of a public user identity associated with a registered
implicit set from barred to non-barred. Usually these automatically or
implicitly registered public user identities belong to the same service
profile of the user and they might not be available within the UE. The
implicitly registered public user identities may also belong to different
service profiles. The here-described procedures provide a different mechanism
(to the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request) to inform the UE about
these automatically registered public user identities.
[NOTE 2: draft-ietf-sipping-gruu-reg-event [94] provides guidance on the
management of temporary GRUUs, utilizing information provided in the reg event
notification.]{.underline}
##### 5.1.2A.1 UE-originating case {#a.1-ue-originating-case .H6}
The procedures of this subclause are general to all requests and responses,
except those for the REGISTER method.
[If a security association exists]{.underline}, when the UE sends any request,
the UE shall [send the request to the protected port received during
registration as described in subclause 5.1.1.5.1 with]{.underline}:
\- ~~include~~[including]{.underline} the protected server port in the Via
header entry relating to the UE.
[Otherwise if no security association exists, i.e. no port is provided for
subsequent SIP messages by P‑CSCF during registration, the UE shall send any
request to the same port used for the initial registration as described in\
subclause 5.1.1.2A.]{.underline}
[If a security association exists]{.underline}, the UE shall discard any SIP
response that is not protected by the security association and is received
from the P‑CSCF outside of the registration and authentication procedures. The
requirements on the UE within the registration and authentication procedures
are defined in subclause 5.1.1.
In accordance with RFC 3325 [34] the UE may insert a P-Preferred-Identity
header in any initial request for a dialog or request for a standalone
transaction as a hint for creation of an asserted identity (contained in the
P-Asserted-Identity header) within the IM CN subsystem.
NOTE 1: Since the S‑CCF uses the P-Asserted-Identity header when checking
whether the UE originating request matches the initial filter criteria, the
P-Preferred-Identity header inserted by the UE determines which services and
applications are invoked.
The UE may include any of the following in the P-Preferred-Identity header:
\- a public user identity which has been registered by the user;
\- a public user identity returned in a registration-state event package of a
NOTIFY request as a result of an implicit registration that was not
subsequently deregistered or has expired; or
\- any other public user identity which the user has assumed by mechanisms
outside the scope of this specification to have a current registration.
NOTE 2: The temporary public user identity specified in subclause 5.1.1.1 is
not a public user identity suitable for use in the P-Preferred-Identity
header.
NOTE 3: Procedures in the network require international public
telecommunication numbers when telephone numbers are used in P-Preferred-
Identity header.
NOTE 4: A number of headers can reveal information about the identity of the
user. Where privacy is required, implementers should also give consideration
to other headers that can reveal identity information. RFC 3323 [33] subclause
4.1 gives considerations relating to a number of headers.
Where privacy is required, in any initial request for a dialog or request for
a standalone transaction, the UE shall set the From header to \"Anonymous\" as
specified in RFC 3261 [26].
NOTE 5: The contents of the From header should not be relied upon to be
modified by the network based on any privacy specified by the user either
within the UE indication of privacy or by network subscription or network
policy. Therefore the user should include the value \"Anonymous\" whenever
privacy is explicitly required. As the user may well have privacy
requirements, terminal manufacturers should not automatically derive and
include values in this header from the public user identity or other values
stored in or derived from the UICC. Where the user has not expressed a
preference in the configuration of the terminal implementation, the
implementation should assume that privacy is required. Users that require to
identify themselves, and are making calls to SIP destinations beyond the IM CN
subsystem, where the destination does not implement RFC 3325 [34], will need
to include a value in the From header other than Anonymous.
The UE shall determine the public user identity to be used for this request as
follows:
1) if a P-Preferred-Identity was included, then use that as the public user
identity for this request; or
2) if no P-Preferred-Identity was included, then use the default public user
identity for the security association as the public user identity for this
request;
If this is a request for a new dialog, and the request includes a Contact
header, then the UE should populate the Contact header as follows:
1) if a public GRUU value (pub-gruu) has been saved associated with the public
user identity to be used for this request, and the UE does not indicate
privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity, then insert the public GRUU\ (pub-gruu)
value in the Contact header as specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93]; ~~or~~
2) if a temporary GRUU value (temp-gruu) has been saved associated with the
public user identity to be used for this request, and the UE does indicate
privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity, then insert the temporary GRUU (temp-gruu)
value in the Contact header as specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93]; ~~or~~
[NOTE 5A: The above items 1 and 2 are mutually exclusive.]{.underline}
3) if the request is related to an IMS communication service that requires the
use of an ICSI then shall include [in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag as defined
in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3841 [56B]]{.underline} ~~in a sip.app-subtype
feature tag~~ the ICSI value (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2), for
the IMS communication service and ~~may include the IARI value (coded as
specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), that is related to the request according to
draft-rosenberg-sip-app-media-tag [120] and RFC 3841 [56B]~~. The UE may also
include other ICSI values that the UE is prepared to use for the communication
and other IARI values for [all dialogs with the terminating
UE(s)]{.underline}~~the IMS application that is related to the IMS
communication service~~; ~~or~~[and]{.underline}
4) if the request is related to an IMS application that is supported by the UE
~~when the use of an ICSI is not needed~~, then may include the IARI value
(coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), that is related to
[any]{.underline} ~~the to the~~ IMS application [and that applies for the
dialog, in a g.3gpp.iari-ref feature tag as defined in subclause
7.9.3]{.underline}~~, according to draft-rosenberg-sip-app-media-tag [120] and
RFC 3841 [56B]~~.
[NOTE 5B: The above items 3 and 4 are mutually exclusive.]{.underline}
If this is a request within an existing dialog, and the request includes a
Contact header, and the Contact address previously used in the dialog was a
GRUU, then the UE should insert the previously used GRUU value in the Contact
header as specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93].
If the UE did not insert a GRUU in the Contact header, then the UE shall
include the protected server port in the address in the Contact header.
If this is a request for a new dialog or standalone transaction and the
request is related to an IMS communication service that requires the use of an
ICSI then the UE:
1) shall include the ICSI value (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2),
for the IMS communication service that is related to the request in a
P-Preferred-Service header field according to draft-drage-sipping-service-
identification [121];
> [NOTE 5A: The UE only receives those ICSI values correponding to the IMS
> communication services that the network provides to the user.]{.underline}
2) may include an Accept-Contact header field containing an ICSI value (coded
as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) ~~or an IARI value (coded as specified in
subclause 7.2A.9.2)~~ that is related to the request in a [g.3gpp.icsi-
ref]{.underline} ~~sip.app-subtype~~ feature tag [as defined in subclause
7.9.2]{.underline}~~according to draft-rosenberg-sip-app-media-tag [120] and
RFC 3841 [56B]~~ if the ICSI ~~or IARI~~ for the IMS communication service is
known.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the UE shall always include an ICSI value in
an Accept-Contact header field. This also may need some clarifications to the
stage 2 text to fully align.
Editor\'s Note: If the UE includes (as mandated) the same ICSI values into the
Accept-Contact header and the\ P-Preferred-Service header, there is a
possibility that one of the involved S‑CCFs or an AS changes the ICSI value in
the P-Asserted-Service header, which results in the message including two
different ICSI values (one in the P-Asserted-Service header, changed in the
network and one in the Accept-Contact header).
[If an IMS application indicates that an IARI is to be included in a request
for a new dialog or standalone transaction, the UE shall include an Accept-
Contact header field containing an IARI value (coded as specified in subclause
7.2A.9.2) that is related to the request in a g.3gpp.iari-ref feature tag as
defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3841 [56B].]{.underline}
NOTE 6: RFC 3841 [56B] allows multiple Accept-Contact header fields along with
multiple Reject-Contact header fields in a SIP request, and within those
header fields, expressions that include one or more logical operations based
on combinations of feature tags. Which registered UE will be contacted depends
on the Accept-Contact header field and Reject-Contact header field
combinations included that evaluate to a logical expression and the relative
qvalues of the registered contacts for the targeted registered public user
identity. There is therefore no guarantee that when multiple Accept-Contact
header fields or additional Reject-Contact header field(s) along with the
Accept-Contact header field containing the ICSI value or IARI value are
included in a request that the request will be routed to a contact that
registered the same ICSI value or IARI value. Charging and accounting is based
upon the contents of the P-Asserted-Service header field and the actual media
related contents of the SIP request and not the Accept-Contact header field
contents or the contact reached.
NOTE 7: The UE only includes the parameters require and explicit in the
Accept-Contact header field containing the ICSI value or IARI value if the IMS
communication service absolutely requires that the terminating UE understand
the IMS communication service in order to be able to accept the session.
Including the parameters require and explicit in Accept-Contact header fields
in requests which do not absolutely require that the terminating UE understand
the IMS communication service in order to accept the session creates an
interoperability problem for sessions which otherwise would interoperate and
violates the interoperability requirements for the [ICSI]{.underline} ~~IMS
Communication Service Identifier~~ in 3GPP TS 23.228 [7].
After the dialog is established the UE may change the dialog capabilities
(e.g. add a media or request a supplementary service) if defined for the IMS
communication service as identified by the ICSI value using the same dialog.
Otherwise, the UE shall initiate a new initial request to the other user.
The UE can indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity that will be generated
by the P‑CSCF in accordance with RFC 3323 [33], and the additional
requirements contained within RFC 3325 [34].
If available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific annexes
for each access technology), the UE shall insert a P-Access-Network-Info
header into any request for a dialog, any subsequent request (except ACK
requests and CANCEL requests) or response (except CANCEL responses) within a
dialog or any request for a standalone method (see subclause 7.2A.4).
NOTE 8: During the dialog, the points of attachment to the IP‑CAN of the UE
may change (e.g. UE connects to different cells). The UE will populate the
P-Access-Network-Info header in any request or response within a dialog with
the current point of attachment to the IP‑CAN (e.g. the current cell
information).
The UE shall build a proper preloaded Route header value for all new dialogs
and standalone transactions. The UE shall build a list of Route header values
made out of, in this order, the P‑CSCF URI (containing the IP address or the
FQDN learnt through the P‑CSCF discovery procedures, and the protected server
port learnt during the registration procedure), and the values received in the
Service-Route header saved from the 200 (OK) response to the last registration
or\ re-registration.
The UE may indicate that proxies should not fork the request by including a
\"no-fork\" directive within the\ Request-Disposition header in the request as
described in RFC 3841 [56B].
When a SIP transaction times out, i.e. timer B, timer F or timer H expires at
the UE, the UE may behave as if timer F expired, as described in subclause
5.1.1.4[, or subclause 5.1.1.4A as appropriate to the authentication mechanism
in use]{.underline}.
NOTE 9: It is an implementation option whether these actions are also
triggered by other means.
The UE may use non-international formats of E.164 addresses, including geo-
local numbers and home-local numbers, in the Request-URI.
NOTE 10: The way how the UE defines the default network for the numbers in a
non-international format is implementation specific.
NOTE 11: The way how the UE process the dial-string and handles special
characters (e.g. pause) in order to produce a conformant SIP URI or tel URI
according to RFC 3966 [22] is implementation specific.
NOTE 12: Home operator\'s local policy can define a prefix string(s) to enable
subscribers to differentiate dialling a geo-local number and/or a home-local
number.
When the UE uses home-local number, the UE shall include in the \"phone-
context\" parameter the home domain name in accordance with RFC 3966 [22].
When the UE uses geo-local number, the UE shall:
\- if access technology information available to the UE (i.e., the UE can
insert P-Access-Network-Info header into the request), include the access
technology information in the \"phone-context\" parameter according to RFC
3966 [22] as defined in subclause 7.2A.10; and
\- if access technology information is not available to the UE (i.e., the UE
cannot insert P-Access-Network-Info header into the request), include in the
\"phone-context\" parameter the home domain name prefixed by the \"geo-
local.\" string according to RFC 3966 [22]as defined in subclause 7.2A.10.
NOTE 13: The \"phone-context\" parameter value can be entered by the
subscriber, or can be inserted by the UE, based on implementation.
##### 5.1.2A.2 UE-terminating case {#a.2-ue-terminating-case .H6}
The procedures of this subclause are general to all requests and responses,
except those for the REGISTER method.
[If a security association exists,]{.underline} the UE shall discard any SIP
request that is not integrity protected and is received from the P‑CSCF
outside of the registration and authentication procedures. The requirements on
the UE within the registration and authentication procedures are defined in
subclause 5.1.1.
If an initial request contains an Accept-Contact header field containing [the
g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag with an ICSI value]{.underline} ~~a sip.app-
subtype feature tag~~ the UE should invoke the IMS application that is the
best match for the ICSI value ~~and if included IARI value contained in the
sip.app-subtype feature tag~~.
[If an initial request contains an Accept-Contact header field containing the
g.3gpp.iari-ref feature tag with a IARI value the UE should invoke the IMS
application that is the best match for the IARI value.]{.underline}
[The UE can receive multiple ICSI values, IARI values or both in a Accept-
Contact header field. In this case it is up to the implementation which of the
multiple ICSI values or IARI values the UE takes action on.]{.underline}
~~The UE can receive multiple Accept-Contact header fields containing sip.app-
subtype feature tags. In this case it is up to the implementation which of the
multiple ICSI values or IARI values it takes action on.~~
[NOTE 1: The application verifies that the contents of the request (e.g. SDP
media capabilities, Content-Type header field) are consistent with the the
ICSI value in the g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag and IARI value contained in the
g.3gpp.iariappref feature tag.]{.underline}
[If an initial request does not contain an Accept-Contact header field
containing a g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag or a g.3gpp.iari-ref feature tag the
UE shall invoke the application that is the best match based on the contents
of the request (e.g. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type header field,
feature tag).]{.underline}
The UE can indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity that will be generated
by the P‑CSCF in accordance with RFC 3323 [33], and the additional
requirements contained within RFC 3325 [34].
NOTE 1: In the UE-terminating case, this version of the document makes no
provision for the UE to provide an\ P-Preferred-Identity in the form of a
hint.
NOTE 2: A number of headers can reveal information about the identity of the
user. Where, privacy is required, implementers should also give consideration
to other headers that can reveal identity information. RFC 3323 [33] subclause
4.1 gives considerations relating to a number of headers.
If the response includes a Contact header, and the response is sent within an
existing dialog, and the Contact address previously used in the dialog was a
GRUU, then the UE should insert the previously used GRUU value in the Contact
header as specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93].
If the response includes a Contact header, and the response is not sent within
an existing dialog, then the UE should populate the Contact header as follows:
1) if a public GRUU value (pub-gruu) has been saved associated with the public
user identity from the\ P‑Called-Party-ID header, and the UE does not indicate
privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity, then insert the public GRUU (pub-gruu)
value in the Contact header as specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93]; ~~or~~
2) if a temporary GRUU value (temp-gruu) has been saved associated with the
public user identity from the P‑Called-Party-ID header, and the UE does
indicate privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity, then the UE should insert the
temporary GRUU (temp-gruu) value in the Contact header as specified in draft-
ietf-sip-gruu [93]; ~~or~~
[NOTE 3: The above items 1 and 2 are mutually exclusive.]{.underline}
3) if the request is related to an IMS communication service that requires the
use of an ICSI then [the UE]{.underline} shall include in a [g.3gpp.icsi-ref
feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3841
[56B]]{.underline}~~sip.app-subtype feature tag~~ the ICSI value (coded as
specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2), for the IMS communication service and may
include the IARI value for the IMS application, (coded as specified in
subclause 7.2A.9.2), that is related to the request [in a g.3gpp.iari-ref
feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3]{.underline}~~according to draft-
rosenberg-sip-app-media-tag [120]~~ and RFC 3841 [56B]. The UE may also
include other ICSI values [that the UE is prepared to use for all dialogs with
the originating UE(s)]{.underline} and other IARI values [for the IMS
application]{.underline} that is related to the IMS communication service
~~that the UE is prepared to use~~; [and]{.underline}~~or~~
4) if the request is related to an IMS application that is supported by the UE
when the use of an ICSI is not needed, then may include the IARI value (coded
as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), that is related to any~~the to the~~ IMS
application [and that applies for the dialog, in a g.3gpp.iari-ref feature tag
as defined in subclause 7.9.3]{.underline}~~, according to draft-rosenberg-
sip-app-media-tag [120] and RFC 3841 [56B]~~.
[NOTE 4: The above items 3 and 4 are mutually exclusive.]{.underline}
After the dialog is established the UE may change the dialog capabilities
(e.g. add a media or request a supplementary service) if defined for the IMS
communication service as identified by the ICSI value using the same dialog.
Otherwise, the UE shall initiate a new initial request to the other user.
If the UE did not insert a GRUU in the Contact header, then the UE shall
include the protected server port in the address in the Contact header.
If available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific annexes
for each access technology), the UE shall insert a P-Access-Network-Info
header into any response to a request for a dialog, any subsequent request
(except CANCEL requests) or response (except CANCEL responses) within a dialog
or any response to a standalone method (see subclause 7.2A.4).
###### 5.1.3.1 Initial INVITE request
[Upon generating an initial INVITE request, the UE shall include the Accept
header with \"application/sdp\", the MIME type associated with the 3GPP IMS
XML body (see subclause 7.6.1) and any other MIME type the UE is willing and
capable to accept.]{.underline}
The \"integration of resource management and SIP\" extension is hereafter in
this subclause referred to as \"the precondition mechanism\" and is defined in
RFC 3312 [30] as updated by RFC 4032 [64].
The preconditions mechanism should be supported by the originating UE.
The UE may initiate a session without the precondition mechanism if the
originating UE does not require local resource reservation.
NOTE 1: The originating UE can decide if local resource reservation is
required based on e.g. application requirements, current access network
capabilities, local configuration, etc.
In order to allow the peer entity to reserve its required resources, an
originating UE supporting the precondition mechanism should make use of the
precondition mechanism, even if it does not require local resource
reservation.
Upon generating an initial INVITE request using the precondition mechanism,
the UE shall:
\- indicate the support for reliable provisional responses and specify it
using the Supported header mechanism; and
\- indicate the support for the preconditions mechanism and specify it using
the Supported header mechanism.
Upon generating an initial INVITE request using the precondition mechanism,
the UE ~~should~~[shall]{.underline} not indicate the requirement for the
precondition mechanism by using the Require header mechanism.
~~NOTE 2: If an UE chooses to require the precondition mechanism, i.e. if it
indicates the \"precondition\" option tag within the Require header, the
interworking with a remote UE, that does not support the precondition
mechanism, is not described in this specification.~~
NOTE ~~3~~[2]{.underline}: Table A.4 specifies that UE support of forking is
required in accordance with RFC 3261 [26]. The UE can accept or reject any of
the forked responses, for example, if the UE is capable of supporting a
limited number of simultaneous transactions or early dialogs.
Upon successful reservation of local resources the UE shall confirm the
successful resource reservation (see subclause 6.1.2) within the next SIP
request.
NOTE ~~4~~[3]{.underline}: In case of the precondition mechanism being used on
both sides, this confirmation will be sent in either a PRACK request or an
UPDATE request. In case of the precondition mechanism not being supported on
one or both sides, alternatively a reINVITE request can be used for this
confirmation, in case the terminating UE does not support the PRACK request
(as described in RFC 3262 [27]) and does not support the UPDATE request (as
described in RFC 3311 [29]).
[If the UE wishes to receive early media authorization indications, as
described in RFC 5009 [109], it shall add the P-Early-Media header with the
\"supported\" parameter]{.underline} [to the INVITE request.]{.underline}
[NOTE 4]{.underline}~~5~~[:]{.underline} If the UE supports the P-Early-Media
header, upon receiving a 18x provisional response with a P-Early-Media header
indicating authorized early media, as described in draft-ejzak-sipping-p-em-
auth [109], if the preconditions are met, the UE should, based on local
configuration, present received early media to the user.
[NOTE ]{.underline}~~6~~[5:]{.underline} If the UE supports the P-Early-Media
header, upon receiving a 180 (Ringing) provisional response with a P-Early-
Media header indicating authorized early media, as described in draft-ejzak-
sipping-p-em-auth [109], if the preconditions are met, and the UE presents the
received early media to the user based on local configuration, the UE
[will]{.underline} ~~should~~ not [provide an indication that the invited user
is being alerted]{.underline}~~generate a local ringing tone~~.
[NOTE ]{.underline}~~7~~[6: If the UE supports the P-Early-Media header and if
the most recently received P-Early-Media header within the dialog includes a
parameter applicable to media stream with value \"inactive\", then based on
local configuration, the UE will provide an indication that the invited user
is being alerted and stop presenting received early media to the user if
requested by any previous receipt of P-Early-Media header within the
dialog.]{.underline}
~~If the UE wishes to receive early media authorization indications, as
described in draft-ejzak-sipping-p-em-auth [109], it shall add the P-Early-
Media header to the INVITE request.~~
When a final answer is received for one of the early dialogues, the UE
proceeds to set up the SIP session. The UE shall not progress any remaining
early dialogues to established dialogs. Therefore, upon the reception of a
subsequent final 200 (OK) response for an INVITE request (e.g., due to
forking), the UE shall:
1) acknowledge the response with an ACK request; and
2) send a BYE request to this dialog in order to terminate it.
Upon receiving a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response to an initial INVITE
request, the originating UE should send a new INVITE request containing SDP
according to the procedures defined in subclause 6.1.
NOTE [7]{.underline}~~6~~: An example of where a new request would not be sent
is where knowledge exists within the UE, or interaction occurs with the user,
such that it is known that the resulting SDP would describe a session that did
not meet the user requirements.
Upon receiving a 421 (Extension Required) response to an initial INVITE
request in which the precondition mechanism was not used, including the
\"precondition\" option tag in the Require header, the originating UE shall:
\- send a new INVITE request using the precondition mechanism, if the
originating UE supports the precondition mechanism; and
\- send an UPDATE request as soon as the necessary resources are available and
a 200 (OK) response for the first PRACK request has been received.
Upon receiving a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to an initial INVITE
request containing a Retry-After header, then the originating UE shall not
automatically reattempt the request until after the period indicated by the
Retry-After header contents.
[In the event the UE receives a 380 (Alternative Service) response to an
INVITE request the response containing a P-Asserted-Identity header field with
a value equal to the value of the last entry on the Path header field value
received during registration and the response containing a 3GPP IM CN
subsystem XML body as described in subclause 7.6 that includes an \
element, including a version attribute, with an \ child
element with the \ child element set to \"emergency\" (see table 7.7AA),
the UE shall attempt an emergency call as described in subclause
5.1.6.]{.underline}
[NOTE 8]{.underline}~~7~~[: The last entry on the Path header field value
received during registration is the value of the SIP URI of the
P-CSCF.]{.underline}
##### 5.1.6.1 General {#general-3 .H6}
A CS and IM CN subsystem capable UE shall follow the conventions and rules
specified in 3GPP TS 22.101 [1A] and 3GPP TS 23.167 [4B] to select the domain
for the emergency call attempt. If the CS domain is selected, the UE shall
attempt an emergency call setup according to the procedures described in 3GPP
TS 24.008 [8].
The UE shall determine, whether it is currently attached to its home
operator\'s network (e.g. HPLMN) or to a different network than its home
operator\'s network (e.g. VPLMN) by applying access technology specific
procedures described in the access technology specific annexes.
If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE is currently attached to its
home operator\'s network (e.g. HPLMN) and the UE is currently registered, the
UE shall attempt an emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.4.
If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE is currently attached to its
home operator\'s network (e.g. HPLMN) and the UE is not currently registered,
the UE shall:
1) perform an initial emergency registration, as described in subclause
5.1.6.2; and
2) attempt an emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.3.
If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE is attached to a different
network than its home operator\'s network (e.g. VPLMN) ~~and the assigned
P-CSCF is located in its home operator\'s network (e.g. in the HPLMN)~~, the
UE shall:
1) perform an initial emergency registration, as described in subclause
5.1.6.2; and
2) attempt an emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.3.
If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE has no credentials the UE can
make an emergency call without being registered. The UE shall attempt an
emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.2.
The IP-CAN can, depend~~a~~ent on the IP-CAN capabilities, provide local
emergency numbers [(including information about emergency service
categories)]{.underline} to the UE which has that capability, in order for the
UE to recognize these numbers as emergency call.
##### 5.1.6.2 Initial emergency registration {#initial-emergency-registration
.H6}
When the user initiates an emergency call, if emergency registration is
needed, the UE shall perform an emergency registration prior to sending the
SIP request related to the emergency call.
[The UE shall have only one valid emergency registration at any given time. If
the UE initiates a new emergency registration using different contact address,
and the previous emergency registration has not expired, the UE shall consider
the previous emergency registration as expired.]{.underline}
[IP-CAN procedures for emergency registration are defined in 3GPP TS 23.167
[4B] and in each access technology specific annex.]{.underline}
When a UE performs an initial emergency registration the UE shall perform the
actions as specified in subclause 5.1.1.2 with the following additions:
\- the UE shall [include a \"sos\" URI parameter in the Contact header field
as described in subclause 7.2A.12, indicating that this is an emergency
registration and that the associated contact address shall be used only for
emergency service]{.underline}~~populate the To and From header in the
REGISTER request with the emergency public user identity as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.003 [3]~~.
When the UE performs an initial emergency registration and whilst this
emergency registration is active, the UE shall:
\- handle the emergency registration independently from any other ongoing
registration to the IM CN subsystem;
\- handle any signalling or media related IP-CAN for the purpose of emergency
calls independently from any other established IP-CAN for IM CN subsystem
related signalling or media; and
\- handle all SIP signalling and all media related to the emergency call
independently from any other ongoing IM CN subsystem signalling and media.
###### 5.1.6.3 Initial subscription to the registration-state event package
[Upon receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request that completes
the emergency registration, t]{.underline}~~T~~he UE shall not subscribe to
the reg event package of the~~for any emergency~~ public user identity
[specified in the REGISTER request]{.underline}.
###### 5.1.6.6 User-initiated emergency deregistration
[Once the UE registers a public user identity and an associated contact
address via emergency registration, t]{.underline}~~T~~he UE shall not perform
user-initiated deregistration of [the respective]{.underline} ~~any registered
emergency~~ public user identity [and the associated contact
address]{.underline}.
NOTE: The UE will be deregistered when the emergency registration expires.
##### 5.1.6.8.1 General {#general-4 .H6}
The UE shall translate any user indicated emergency number as specified in
3GPP TS 22.101 [1A] to an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN with a
top-level service type of \"sos\" service type as specified in draft-ietf-
ecrit-service-urn [69]. [A Request-URI of an initial request for a dialog or a
standalone transaction, or an unknown method transmitted as part of UE
detected emergency call procedures as defined in subclause 5.1.6 shall include
one of the following service URNs; \"urn:service:sos\",
\"urn:service:sos.ambulance\", \"urn:service:sos.police\",
\"urn:service:sos.fire\", \"urn:service:sos.marine\",
\"urn:service:sos.mountain\". If the UE can determine the type of emergency
service the UE shall include a]{.underline}~~An additional~~ sub-service type
~~can be added if information on the type of emergency service is known~~.
[NOTE 1: A service URN with a top-level service type of \"sos\" is used only
when the user intends to establish an emergency call.]{.underline}
In the event the UE receives a 380 (Alternative Service) response to an INVITE
request the response containing a [3GPP]{.underline} XML body that includes
[an \ element, including a version attribute, with]{.underline} an
\[child]{.underline} element with the
\ child element set to \"emergency [(see table 7.7AA)]{.underline}\",
the UE shall automatically send an ACK request to the P-CSCF as per normal SIP
procedures and terminate the session. [In addition, if the 380 (Alternative
Service) response includes a P-Asserted-Identity header field with a value
equal to the value of the last entry on the Path header field value received
during registration one of subclause 5.1.6.8.3 or subclause 5.1.6.8.4
applies.]{.underline}
~~NOTE 1: The UE can attempt an emergency call setup according to the
procedures described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].~~
NOTE 2~~1~~: Emergency numbers which the UE does not detect, will be treated
as a normal call.
NOTE [3]{.underline}~~2~~: The last entry on the Path header field value
received during registration is the value of the SIP URI of the P-CSCF.
##### 5.1.6.8.2 Emergency session set-up in case of no registration
{#emergency-session-set-up-in-case-of-no-registration .H6}
When establishing an emergency session for an unregistered user, the UE shall
be allowed to receive responses to emergency requests and requests inside an
established emergency session on the unprotected ports. All other messages not
arriving on a protected port shall be rejected or silently discarded by the
UE.
Prior to establishing an emergency session for an unregistered user, the UE
shall acquire a local IP address, discover a P-CSCF, and establish an IP-CAN
bearer that can be used for SIP signalling. The UE shall send only the initial
INVITE requests to the port advertised to the UE during the P-CSCF discovery
procedure. If the UE does not receive any specific port information during the
P-CSCF discovery procedure, the UE shall send the initial INVITE request to
the SIP default port values as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
The UE shall apply the procedures as specified in subclause 5.1.2A.1 and
subclause 5.1.3 with the following additions:
1) the UE shall set the From header field of the INVITE request to
\"Anonymous\" as specified in RFC 3261 [26];
2) the UE shall include a [service URN in the]{.underline} Request-URI
~~in~~[of]{.underline} the initial INVITE request [in accordance with
subclause 5.1.6.8.1]{.underline} ~~that contains an emergency service URN,
i.e. a service URN with a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in
draft ietf-ecrit-service-urn [69]~~. ~~An additional sub-service type can be
added if information on the type of emergency service is known~~;
NOTE 1: Other specifications make provision for emergency service identifiers,
that are not specifically the emergency service URN, to be recognised in the
UE. Emergency service identifiers which the UE does not detect will be treated
as a normal call by the UE.
3) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a To header with:
\- the same emergency service URN as in the Request URI; or
\- if the UE cannot perform local dialstring interpretation for the dialled
digits, a dialstring URI representing the dialled digits in accordance with
RFC 4967 [103] or a tel URL representing the dialled digits;
NOTE 2: This version of this document does not provide any specified handling
of a URI with the dialled digits in accordance with RFC 4967 [103] at an
entity within the IM CN susbsystem. Behaviour when this is used is therefore
not defined.
4) if available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology), the UE shall include in the P-Access-
Network-Info header in any request for a dialog, any subsequent request
(except ACK requests and CANCEL requests) or response (except CANCEL
responses) within a dialog or any request. The UE shall populate the P-Access-
Network-Info header with the current point of attachment to the IP-CAN as
specified for the access network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4). The
P-Access-Network-Info header contains the location identifier such as the cell
id, the line id or the identity of the I-WLAN access node, which is relevant
for routeing the IMS emergency call;
5) the UE shall populate the P-Preferred-Identity header in the INVITE request
with an equipment identifier as a SIP URI. The special details of the
equipment identifier to use depends on the IP-CAN;
6) a Contact header set to include SIP URI that contains in the hostport
parameter the IP address of the UE and an unprotected port where the UE will
receive incoming requests belonging to this dialog. The UE shall not include
either the public or temporary GRUU in the Contact header;
7) a Via header set to include the IP address of the UE in the sent-by field
and for the UDP the unprotected server port value where the UE will receive
response to the emergency request, while for the TCP, the response is received
on the TCP connection on which the emergency request was sent;
8) if the UE has its location information available, it shall include the
location information in the INVITE request in the following way:
\- if the UE is aware of the URI that points to where the UE\'s location is
stored, include the URI in the Geolocation header in accordance with draft-
ietf-sip-location-conveyance [89]; or
\- if the geographical location information of the UE is available to the UE,
include its geographical location information as PIDF location object in
accordance with RFC 4119 [90] and include the location object in a message
body with the content type application/pidf+xml in accordance with draft-ietf-
sip-location-conveyance [89]. The Geolocation header is set to a Content ID in
accordance with draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance [89]; and
9) if the UE has no geographical location information available, the UE shall
not include any geographical location information as specified in draft-ietf-
sip-location-conveyance [89] in the INVITE request.
NOTE 3: It is suggested that UE\'s only use the option of providing a URI when
the domain part belongs to the current P-CSCF or S-CSCF provider. This is an
issue on which the network operator needs to provide guidance to the end user.
A URI that is only resolvable to the UE which is making the emergency call is
not desirable.
NOTE 4: During the dialog, the points of attachment to the IP-CAN of the UE
can change (e.g. UE connects to different cells). The UE will populate the
P-Access-Network-Info header in any request or response within a dialog with
the current point of attachment to the IP-CAN (e.g. the current cell
information).
The UE shall build a proper preloaded Route header value for all new dialogs.
The UE shall build a Route header value containing only the P-CSCF URI
(containing the unprotected port number and the IP address or the FQDN learnt
through the P-CSCF discovery procedures).
When a SIP transaction times out, i.e. timer B, timer F or timer H expires at
the UE, the UE may behave as if timer F expired, as described in subclause
5.1.1.4.
NOTE 5: It is an implementation option whether these actions are also
triggered by other means.
NOTE 6: A number of headers can reveal information about the identity of the
user. Where privacy is required, implementers should also give consideration
to other headers that can reveal identity information. RFC 3323 [33] subclause
4.1 gives considerations relating to a number of headers.
NOTE 7: RFC 3261 [26] provides for the use of the Priority header field with a
suggested value of \"emergency\". It is not precluded that emergency sessions
contain this value, but such usage will have no impact on the processing
within the IM CN subsystem.
##### 5.1.6.8.3 Emergency session set-up within an emergency registration
{#emergency-session-set-up-within-an-emergency-registration .H6}
After a successful initial emergency registration, the UE shall apply the
procedures as specified in subclause 5.1.2A, 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 with the
following additions:
[1) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a From header that includes the
public user identity registered via emergency registration or the tel URI

emergency public user identity, as described in subclause 4.2;~~
[4) if available to the UE, and if defined for the access type as specified in
subclause 7.2A.4, the P-Access-Network-Info header shall contain a location
identifier such as the cell id, line id or the identity of the I-WLAN access
node, which is relevant for routeing the emergency call;]{.underline}

##### 5.2.1 General {#general-5 .H6}
Subclause 5.2.2 through subclause 5.2.9 define P‑CSCF procedures for SIP that
do not relate to emergency. All SIP requests are first screened according to
the procedures of subclause 5.2.10 to see if they do relate to an emergency.
The P‑CSCF shall support the Path and Service-Route headers.
NOTE 1: The Path header is only applicable to the REGISTER request and its 200
(OK) response. The\ Service-Route header is only applicable to the 200 (OK)
response of REGISTER request.
When the P‑CSCF sends any request or response to the UE, before sending the
message the P‑CSCF shall:
\- remove the P‑Charging-Function-Addresses and P‑Charging-Vector headers, if
present.
When the P‑CSCF receives any request or response from the UE, the P‑CSCF
shall:
\- remove the P‑Charging-Function-Addresses and P‑Charging-Vector headers, if
present. Also, the P‑CSCF shall ignore any data received in the P‑Charging-
Function-Addresses and P‑Charging-Vector headers;
\- may insert previously saved values into the P‑Charging-Function-Addresses
and P‑Charging-Vector headers before forwarding the message.
NOTE 2: When the P‑CSCF is located in the visited network, then it will not
receive the P‑Charging-Function-Addresses header from the S‑CCF, IBCF, or
I-CSCF. Instead, the P‑CSCF discovers charging function addresses by other
means not specified in this document.
[- remove any P-Access-Network-Info header if such header contains a
\"network-provided\" parameter; and]{.underline}
[- if the P‑CSCF has access to a NASS supporting the UE, and the request is
not an ACK request or CANCEL request or CANCEL response, add a P-Access-
Network-Info header field that contains the \"network-provided\" parameter,
and include other parameters in the P-Access-Network-Info header in accordance
with the information received from the NASS.]{.underline}
> [NOTE 2A: Addition of the P-Access-Network-Info header by proxies, and
> repetition of the P-Access-Network-Info header within the same request or
> response, requires an update to RFC 3455 before such usage is
> valid.]{.underline}
When the P‑CSCF receives any request or response containing the P-Media-
Authorization header, the P‑CSCF shall remove the header.
NOTE 3: [When a security association was set up at registration]{.underline},
the P‑CSCF will integrity protect all SIP messages sent to the UE outside of
the registration and authentication procedures by using ~~a~~[the]{.underline}
security association. [When a security association was set up at
registration]{.underline}, the P‑CSCF will discard any SIP message that is not
protected by using ~~a~~[the]{.underline} security association and is received
outside of the registration and authentication procedures. The integrity and
confidentiality protection and checking requirements on the P‑CSCF within the
registration and authentication procedures are defined in subclause 5.2.2.
[In case IPsec is employed as security mechanism and an IPsec security
association is established and the UE has requested symmetric response routing
via an \"rport\" parameter in the topmost Via header field, in accordance with
RFC 3581 [56A], the P-CSCF shall use the ports used for establishing the IPsec
security association to forward responses, i.e. the P-CSCF shall ignore the
request for symmetric response routeing.]{.underline}
[For each registration, the P‑CSCF determines the type of access security to
apply:]{.underline}
  * [if the initial REGISTER contains the Security-Client header field, the P‑CSCF shall behave as specified in subclause 5.2.2;]{.underline}
  * [otherwise, the P‑CSCF shall behave as specified in subclause 5.2.2A]{.underline}.
With the exception of 305 (Use Proxy) responses, the P‑CSCF shall not recurse
on 3xx responses.
~~NOTE 4: If the P‑CSCF is connected to a PDF the requirements for this
interconnection is specified in the Release 6 version of this specification.~~
When the P‑CSCF receives a SIP request or SIP response containing the P-Early-
Media header, the P‑CSCF may add, remove, or modify, the header depending on
whether media will be allowed to traverse to/from the UE at the point when the
header is received.
NOTE ~~5~~4: The P‑CSCF can use the header for the gate control procedures, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D].
In case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided
by a NA(P)T or NA(P)T-PT controlled by the P‑CSCF, the P‑CSCF may need to
modify the SIP contents according to the procedures described in annex F. In
case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided by
a NA(P)T or NA(P)T-PT not controlled by the P‑CSCF, the P‑CSCF may need to
modify the SIP contents according to the procedures described in annex K if
both a reg-id and instance ID parameter are present in the received contact
header as described in\ draft-ieft-outbound [92].
##### 5.2.2 Registration [(with security association set-up)]{.underline}
{#registration-with-security-association-set-up .H6}
The P‑CSCF shall be prepared to receive only the initial REGISTER requests on
the SIP default port values as specified in RFC 3261 [26]. The P‑CSCF shall
also be prepared to receive only the initial REGISTER requests on the port
advertised to the UE during the P‑CSCF discovery procedure.
When the P‑CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, the P‑CSCF shall:
1) insert a Path header in the request including an entry containing:
\- the SIP URI identifying the P‑CSCF;
\- an indication that requests routed in this direction of the path (i.e. from
the S‑CCF towards the P‑CSCF) are expected to be treated as for the UE-
terminating case. This indication may e.g. be in a parameter in the URI, a
character string in the user part of the URI, or be a port number in the URI;
2) insert a Require header containing the option tag \"path\";
3) insert a P‑Charging-Vector header with the icid parameter populated as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17] and a type 1 orig-ioi parameter. The P‑CSCF
shall set the type 1 orig-ioi parameter to a value that identifies the sending
network of the request. The P‑CSCF shall not include the type 1 term-ioi
parameter;
4) insert the parameter \"integrity-protected\" (described in subclause
7.2A.2) with a value \"yes\" into the Authorization header field in case the
REGISTER request was either received protected with the security association
created during an ongoing authentication procedure and includes an
authentication challenge response (i.e. RES parameter), or it was received on
the security association created during the last successful authentication
procedure and with no authentication challenge response (i.e. no RES
parameter), otherwise insert the parameter with the value \"no\";
5) in case the REGISTER request was received without protection, then check
the existence of the\ Security-Client header. If the header is present, then
remove and store it. If the header is not present, then the P‑CSCF shall
return a suitable 4xx response;
6) in case the REGISTER request was received protected, then the P‑CSCF shall:
a) check the security association which protected the request. If the security
association is a temporary one, then the request is expected to contain a
Security-Verify header in addition to a Security-Client header. If there are
no such headers, then the P‑CSCF shall return a suitable 4xx response. If
there are such headers, then the P‑CSCF shall compare the content of the
Security-Verify header with the content of the Security-Server header sent
earlier and the content of the Security-Client header with the content of the
Security-Client header received in the challenged REGISTER. If those do not
match, then there is a potential man-in-the-middle attack. The request should
be rejected by sending a suitable 4xx response. If the contents match, the
P‑CSCF shall remove the Security-Verify and the Security-Client header;
b) if the security association the REGISTER request was received on, is an
already established one, then:
\- the P‑CSCF shall remove the Security-Verify header if it is present;
\- a Security-Client header containing new parameter values is expected. If
this header or any required parameter is missing, then the p‑CSCF shall return
a suitable 4xx response;
\- the p‑CSCF shall remove and store the Security-Client header before
forwarding the request to the S‑CCF; and
c) check if the private user identity conveyed in the Authorization header of
the protected REGISTER request is the same as the private user identity which
was previously challenged or authenticated. If the private user identities are
different, the p‑CSCF shall reject the REGISTER request by returning a 403
(Forbidden) response;
7) insert a P-Visited-Network-ID header field, with the value of a pre-
provisioned string that identifies the visited network at the home network;
8) if the p‑CSCF is located in the visited network, and local policy requires
the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards the home
network, forward the request to an IBCF in the visited network
> If the selected exit point:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
P‑CSCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;
> the p‑CSCF shall select a new exit point and forward the original REGISTER
> request.
NOTE 1: The list of the exit points can be either obtained as specified in RFC
3263 [27A] or provisioned in the P‑CSCF.
> If the P‑CSCF fails to forward the REGISTER request to any exit point, the
> P‑CSCF shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response to the user, in
> accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26] unless local policy allows
> omitting the exit point; and
NOTE 2: If the P‑CSCF forwards the request to an IBCF in the visited network,
the IBCF can determine the entry point of the home network, using the same
mechanisms as described in note 1 above. ~~In that case the P‑CSCF does not
need to determine the entry point of the home network.~~
9) [if the P-CSCF is located in the visited network and local policy does not
require the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards
the home network,]{.underline} determine the entry point of the home network
and forward the request to that entry point.
> If the selected entry point:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
P‑CSCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;

> request.
NOTE 3: The list of the entry points can be either obtained as specified in
RFC 3263 [27A] or provisioned in the P‑CSCF.
> If the P‑CSCF fails to forward the REGISTER request to any entry point, the
> P‑CSCF shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response to the user, in
> accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26][; and]{.underline}~~.~~
[10) if the P-CSCF is located in the home network, determine the I-CSCF of the
home network and forward the request to that I-CSCF.]{.underline}
[If the selected I-CSCF:]{.underline}
[- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
P-CSCF; or]{.underline}
[- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;]{.underline}
[the P-CSCF shall select a new I-CSCF and forward the original REGISTER
request.]{.underline}
[NOTE 3A: The list of the I-CSCFs can be either obtained as specified in RFC
3263 [27A] or provisioned in the P-CSCF.]{.underline}

> P-CSCF shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response to the user, in
> accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26].]{.underline}
When the P‑CSCF receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER request,
the P‑CSCF shall:
1) delete any temporary set of security associations established towards the
UE;
2) remove the CK and IK values contained in the 401 (Unauthorized) response
and bind them to the proper private user identity and to the temporary set of
security associations which will be setup as a result of this challenge. The
P‑CSCF shall forward the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the UE if and only if
the CK and IK have been removed;
3) insert a Security-Server header in the response, containing the P‑CSCF
static security list and the parameters needed for the security association
setup, as specified in annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 [19]. The P‑CSCF shall
support the \"ipsec-3gpp\" security mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 [48].
The P‑CSCF shall support the IPsec layer algorithms for integrity and
confidentiality protection as defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and shall
announce support for them according to the procedures defined in RFC 3329
[48];
4) set up the temporary set of security associations with a temporary SIP
level lifetime between the UE and the P‑CSCF for the user identified with the
private user identity. For further details see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19] and RFC
3329 [48]. The P‑CSCF shall set the temporary SIP level lifetime for the
temporary set of security associations to the value of reg-await-auth timer;
and
5) send the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the UE using the security
association with which the associated REGISTER request was protected, or
unprotected in case the REGISTER request was received unprotected.
NOTE 4: The challenge in the 401 (Unauthorized) response sent back by the
S‑CCF to the UE as a response to the REGISTER request is piggybacked by the
P‑CSCF to insert the Security-Server header field in it. The S‑CCF
authenticates the UE, while the P‑CSCF negotiates and sets up two pairs of
security associations with the UE during the same registration procedure. For
further details see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
When the P‑CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request, the P‑CSCF
shall check the value of the Expires header field and/or Expires parameter in
the Contact header. When the value of the Expires header field and/or expires
parameter in the Contact header is different than zero, then the P‑CSCF shall:
1) save the list of Service-Route headers preserving the order. The P‑CSCF
shall store this list during the entire registration period of the respective
public user identity. The P‑CSCF shall use this list to validate the routeing
information in the requests originated by the UE. If this registration is a
reregistration, the P‑CSCF shall replace the already existing list of Service-
Route headers with the new list;
2) associate the Service-Route header list with the registered public user
identity;
3) store the public user identities [and wildcarded public user
identities]{.underline}, found in the P-Associated-URI header value, including
any associated display names, and associate them to the registered public user
identity, i.e. the registered public user identity and its associated set of
implicitly registered public user identities [and implicitly]{.underline}
[registered wildcarded public user identities]{.underline};
4) store the default public user identity, including its associated display
name, if provided, for use with procedures for the P-Asserted-Identity header.
The default public user identity is the first on the list of URIs present in
the P-Associated-URI header;
NOTE 5: There can be more than one default public user identity stored in the
P‑CSCF, as the result of the multiple registrations of public user identities.
5) store the values received in the P‑Charging-Function-Addresses header;
6) if a term-ioi parameter is received in the P‑Charging-Vector header, store
the value of the received term-ioi parameter;
NOTE 6: Any received term-ioi parameter will be a type 1 term-ioi. The type 1
term-ioi identifies the home network of the registered user.
7) if an existing set of security association is available, set the SIP level
lifetime of the security association to the longest of either the previously
existing security association lifetime, or the lifetime of the just completed
registration plus 30 seconds;
8) if a temporary set of security associations exists, change the temporary
set of security associations to a newly established set of security
associations, i.e. set its SIP level lifetime to the longest of either the
previously existing set of security associations SIP level lifetime, or the
lifetime of the just completed registration plus\ 30 seconds; and
9) protect the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request within the same
security association to that in which the request was protected.
When receiving a SIP message (including REGISTER requests) from the UE over
the newly established set of security associations that have not yet been
taken into use, the P‑CSCF shall:
1) reduce the SIP level lifetime of the old set of security associations
towards the same UE to 64*T1 (if currently longer than 64*T1); and
2) use the newly established set of security associations for further messages
sent towards the UE as appropriate (i.e. take the newly established set of
security associations into use).
NOTE 7: In this case, the P‑CSCF will send requests towards the UE over the
newly established set of security associations. Responses towards the UE that
are sent via UDP will be sent over the newly established set of security
associations. Responses towards the UE that are sent via TCP will be sent over
the same set of security associations that the related request was received
on.
NOTE 8: When receiving a SIP message (including REGISTER requests) from the UE
over a set of security associations that is different from the newly
established set of security associations, the P‑CSCF will not take any action
on any set of security associations.
When the SIP level lifetime of an old set of security associations is about to
expire, i.e. their SIP level lifetime is shorter than 64*T1 and a newly
established set of security associations has not been taken into use, the
P‑CSCF shall use the newly established set of security associations for
further messages towards the UE as appropriate (see note 5).
When sending the 200 (OK) response for a REGISTER request that concludes a re-
authentication, the P‑CSCF shall:
1) keep the set of security associations that was used for the REGISTER
request that initiated the re‑authentication;
2) keep the newly established set of security associations created during this
authentication;
3) delete, if existing, any other set of security associations towards this UE
immediately; and
4) go on using for further requests sent towards the UE the set of security
associations that was used to protect the REGISTER request that initiated the
re-authentication.
When sending the 200 (OK) response for a REGISTER request that concludes an
initial authentication, i.e. the initial REGISTER request was received
unprotected, the P‑CSCF shall:
1) keep the newly established set of security associations created during this
authentication;
2) delete, if existing, any other set of security associations towards this UE
immediately; and
3) use the kept newly established set of security associations for further
messages sent towards the UE.
NOTE 9: The P‑CSCF will maintain two Route header lists. The first Route
header list - created during the registration procedure - is used only to
validate the routeing information in the initial requests that originate from
the UE. This list is valid during the entire registration of the respective
public user identity. The second Route list - constructed from the Record
Route headers in the initial INVITE and associated response - is used during
the duration of the call. Once the call is terminated, the second Route list
is discarded.
The P‑CSCF shall delete any security association from the IPsec database when
their SIP level lifetime expires.
The handling of the security associations at the P‑CSCF is summarized in table
5.2.2-1.

###### 5.2.4 Registration of multiple public user identities
Upon receipt of a 2xx response to the SUBSCRIBE request the P-CSCF shall
maintain the generated dialog (identified by the values of the Call-ID
[header]{.underline}, [and the values of tags in]{.underline} To and From
headers).
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription to the reg event package of the user, the P-CSCF shall perform
the following actions:
1) for each public user identity whose state attribute in the \
element is set to \"active\", i.e. registered; and
\- the state attribute within the \ sub-element is set to \"active\";
and
\- the value of the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element is
set to the contact address of the user\'s UE; and
\- the event attribute of that \ sub-element(s) is set to
\"registered\" or \"created\";
> the P-CSCF shall:
\- bind the indicated public user identity as registered to the contact
information of the respective user; and
\- add the public user identity to the list of the public user identities that
are registered for the user;
2) for each public user identity whose state attribute in the \
element is set to \"active\", i.e. registered: and
\- the state attribute within the \ sub-element is set to
\"terminated\";
\- the value of the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element is
set to the contact address of the user\'s UE; and
\- the event attribute of that \ sub-element(s) is set to
\"deactivated\", \"expired\", \"probation\", \"unregistered\", or
\"rejected\";
the P-CSCF shall consider the indicated public user identity as deregistered
for this user, and shall release all stored information for the public user
identity bound to the respective user; and
3) for each public user identity whose state attribute in the \
element is set to \"terminated\", i.e. deregistered; and
\- the value of the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element is
set to the contact address of the user\'s UE; and
\- the event attribute of that \ sub-element(s) is set to
\"deactivated\", \"expired\", \"probation\", \"unregistered\", or
\"rejected\";
the P-CSCF shall consider the indicated public user identity as deregistered
for this UE, and shall release all stored information for these public user
identity bound to the respective user and remove the public user identity from
the list of the public user identities that are registered for the user.
If all public user identities, that were registered by the user using its
private user identity, have been deregistered, the P-CSCF, will receive from
the S-CSCF a NOTIFY request that may include the Subscription-State header set
to \"terminated\", as described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2. If the Subscription-
State header was not set to \"terminated\", the P-CSCF may either unsubscribe
to the reg event package of the user or let the subscription expire.
NOTE 1: Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request with the Subscription-State header
set to \"terminated\", the P-CSCF considers the subscription to the reg event
package terminated (i.e. as if the P-CSCF had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with an
Expires header containing a value of zero).
NOTE 2: There may be public user identities which are implicitly registered
within the registrar (S-CSCF) of the user upon registration of one public user
identity. The procedures in this subclause provide a mechanism to inform the
P-CSCF about these implicitly registered public user identities.
##### 5.2.5.1 User-initiated deregistration {#user-initiated-deregistration
.H6}
When the P‑CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request (sent
according to subclause 5.2.2 [or subclause 5.2.2A]{.underline}) sent by this
UE, it shall check the value of the Expires header field and/or expires
parameter in the Contact header field. When the value of the Expires header
field or expires parameter equals zero, then the P‑CSCF shall:
1) remove the public user identity found in the To header field, and all the
associated public user identities, from the registered public user identities
list belonging to this UE and all related stored information; and
2) check if the UE has left any other registered public user identity. When
all of the public user identities that were registered by this UE are
deregistered, the P‑CSCF shall delete the security associations [(if
present)]{.underline} towards the UE, after the server transaction (as defined
in RFC 3261 [26]) pertaining to this deregistration terminates.
NOTE 1: Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request with all \ element(s)
having their state attribute set to \"terminated\" (i.e. all public user
identities are deregistered) and the Subscription-State header set to
\"terminated\", the P‑CSCF considers the subscription to the reg event package
terminated (i.e. as if the P‑CSCF had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires
header containing a value of zero).
NOTE 2: There is no requirement to distinguish a REGISTER request relating to
a registration from that relating to a deregistration. For administration
reasons the P‑CSCF may distinguish such requests, however this has no impact
on the SIP procedures.
NOTE 3: When the P‑CSCF has sent the 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER
request of the only public user identity currently registered with its
associated set of implicitly registered public user identities (i.e. no other
is registered), the P‑CSCF removes [(if present)]{.underline} the security
association established between the P‑CSCF and the UE. Therefore further SIP
signalling (e.g. the NOTIFY request containing the deregistration event) will
not reach the UE.
##### 5.2.5.2 Network-initiated deregistration {#network-initiated-
deregistration-1 .H6}
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription to the reg event package of the UE, as described in subclause
5.2.3, including one or more \ element(s) which were registered
by the UE with either:
\- the state attribute set to \"terminated\"; or
\- the state attribute set to \"active\" and the state attribute within the
\ sub-element belonging to this UE set to \"terminated\", and the
event attribute within the \ sub-element belonging to this UE set to
\"rejected\" or \"deactivated\";
the P‑CSCF shall remove all stored information for these public user
identities for this UE and remove these public user identities from the list
of the public user identities that are registered for the user.
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request with all \ element(s) having
their state attribute set to \"terminated\"\ (i.e. all public user identities
are deregistered) and the Subscription-State header set to \"terminated\" or
when all public user identities of the UE have been deregistered, the P‑CSCF
shall shorten [any existing]{.underline} security associations towards the UE.
NOTE 1: The security association between the P‑CSCF and the UE is shortened to
a value that will allow the NOTIFY request containing the deregistration event
to reach the UE.
NOTE 2: When the P‑CSCF receives the NOTIFY request with Subscription-State
header containing the value of \"terminated\", the P‑CSCF considers the
subscription to the reg event package terminated (i.e. as if the P‑CSCF had
sent a SUBSCRIBE request to the S‑CCF with an Expires header containing a
value of zero).
##### 5.2.6.2 Determination of UE-originated or UE-terminated case
{#determination-of-ue-originated-or-ue-terminated-case .H6}
Upon receipt of an initial request or a target refresh request or a stand-
alone transaction, the P‑CSCF shall:
\- perform the procedures for the UE-terminating case as described in
subclause 5.2.6.4 if the request makes use of the information for UE-
terminating calls, which was added to the Path header entry of the P‑CSCF
during registration (see subclause 5.2.2 [or subclause 5.2.2A]{.underline}),
e.g. the message is received at a certain port or the topmost Route header
contains a specific user part or parameter;
\- perform the procedures for the UE-originating case as described in
subclause 5.2.6.3 if this information is not used by the request.
##### 5.2.6.3 Requests initiated by the UE {#requests-initiated-by-the-ue .H6}
When the P‑CSCF receives from the UE an initial request for a dialog or a
request for a standalone transaction, and the request contains a P-Preferred-
Identity header that matches one of the registered public user identities, [or
wildcarded public user identities]{.underline} the P‑CSCF shall identify the
initiator of the request by that public user identity.
[NOTE 1: If no security association was set-up during registration, the P‑CSCF
identifies the initiator of the request by matching the IP source address and
port of the request with the IP source address entries stored during the
registration for which it holds the list of registered public user
identities.]{.underline}
When the P‑CSCF receives from the UE an initial request for a dialog or a
request for a standalone transaction, and the request contains a P-Preferred-
Identity header that does not match one of the registered public user
identities, or does not contain a P-Preferred-Identity header, the P‑CSCF
shall identify the initiator of the request by a default public user identity.
If there is more than one default public user identity available, the P‑CSCF
shall randomly select one of them.
[NOTE 2: If no security association was set-up during registration, the P‑CSCF
identifies the initiator of the request by matching the IP source address and
port of the request with the IP source address entries stored during the
registration for which it holds one or more default public user
identities.]{.underline}
NOTE [3~~1~~]{.underline}: The contents of the From header do not form any
part of this decision process.
NOTE [4]{.underline}~~2~~: The display-name portion of the P-Preferred-
Identity header and the registered public user identities is not included in
the comparison to determine a match.
When the P‑CSCF receives from the UE an initial request for a dialog, and a
Service-Route header list exists for the initiator of the request, the P‑CSCF
shall:
[0A) remove its own SIP URI from the top of the list of Route
headers;]{.underline}
1) verify that [the resulting list of Route headers matches]{.underline} the
list of URIs received in the Service-Route header (during the last successful
registration or\ re-registration). This verification is done on a per URI
basis, not as a whole string. If the verification fails, then the P‑CSCF shall
either:
a) return a 400 (Bad Request) response; the P‑CSCF shall not forward the
request, and shall not continue with the execution of steps 2 onwards; or
b) replace the preloaded Route header value in the request with the value of
the Service-Route header received during the last 200 (OK) response for [the
last successful]{.underline} ~~a~~ registration or reregistration;
2) if the P‑CSCF is located in the visited network, and local policy requires
IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards the home network, then the
P‑CSCF shall select an IBCF in the visited network and add the URI of the
selected IBCF to the topmost Route header;
NOTE [5]{.underline}~~3~~: It is implementation dependent as to how the P‑CSCF
obtains the address of the IBCF exit point.
3) add its own address to the Via header. The P‑CSCF Via header entry is built
in a format that contains the port number of the P‑CSCF in accordance with the
procedures of RFC3261 [26], and either:
a) the P‑CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address; or
b) the P‑CSCF IP address;
4) when adding its own SIP URI to the top of the Record-Route header, build
the P‑CSCF SIP URI in a format that contains the port number of the P‑CSCF
where it awaits subsequent requests from the called party, and either:
a) the P‑CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address; or
b) the P‑CSCF IP address;
5) remove the P-Preferred-Identity header, if present, and insert a
P-Asserted-Identity header with a value including the display name if
previously stored during registration representing the initiator of the
request;
6) add a P‑Charging-Vector header with the icid parameter populated as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17];
[6A) if the identity of the initiator of the request was taken from
P-Preferred-Identity header field by it matching a registered wildcarded
public user identity and the P-CSCF supports the SIP P-Profile-Key private
header extension, include the wildcarded public user identity value in the
P-Profile-Key header field as defined in RFC 5002 [97];]{.underline}
7) if the request is an INVITE request, save the Contact, CSeq and Record-
Route header field values received in the request such that the P‑CSCF is able
to release the session if needed;
before forwarding the request, based on the topmost Route header, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
When the P‑CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the above request, the
P‑CSCF shall:
1) store the values received in the P‑Charging-Function-Addresses header;
2) store the list of Record-Route headers from the received response;
3) store the dialog ID and associate it with the private user identity and
public user identity involved in the session;
4) [if a security association exists,]{.underline} in the response rewrite its
own Record Route entry to its own SIP URI that contains the protected server
port number of the security association established from the UE to the P‑CSCF
and either:
a) the P‑CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address of the security association
established from the UE to the P‑CSCF; or
b) the P‑CSCF IP address of the security association established from the UE
to the P‑CSCF; and
NOTE [~~4~~6]{.underline}: The P‑CSCF associates two ports, a protected client
port and a protected server port, with each pair of security associations. For
details on the selection of the protected port values see 3GPP TS 33.203 [19].
5) if the response corresponds to an INVITE request, save the Contact, From,
To and Record-Route header field values received in the response such that the
P‑CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
before forwarding the response to the UE in accordance with the procedures of
RFC 3261 [26].
When the P‑CSCF receives from the UE a target refresh request for a dialog,
the P‑CSCF shall:
1) verify if the request relates to a dialog in which the originator of the
request is involved:
a) if the request does not relates to an existing dialog in which the
originator is involved, then the P‑CSCF shall answer the request by sending a
403 (Forbidden) response back to the originator. The P‑CSCF will not forward
the request. No other actions are required; or
b) if the request relates to an existing dialog in which the originator is
involved, then the P‑CSCF shall continue with the following steps;
[1A) remove its own SIP URI from the top of the list of Route
headers;]{.underline}
2) verify that the [resulting]{.underline} list of Route headers ~~in the
request~~ matches the ~~stored~~ list of Record-Route headers for [constructed
by inverting the order of the stored list of Record-Route headers and removing
its Record-Route header from the list]{.underline} ~~the same dialog~~. This
verification is done on a per URI basis, not as a whole string. If the
verification fails, then the P‑CSCF shall either:
a) return a 400 (Bad Request) response; the P‑CSCF shall not forward the
request, and shall not continue with the execution of steps 3 onwards; or
b) replace the Route header value in the request with the ~~stored~~ list of
Record-Route headers [constructed by inverting the order of the stored list of
Record-Route headers and removing its Record-Route header from the
list]{.underline} ~~for the same dialog~~;
3) add its own address to the Via header. The P‑CSCF Via header entry is built
in a format that contains the port number of the P‑CSCF where it awaits the
responses to come, and either:
a) the P‑CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address, or
b) the P‑CSCF IP address;
4) when adding its own SIP URI to the Record-Route header, build the P‑CSCF
SIP URI in a format that contains the port number of the P‑CSCF where it
awaits subsequent requests from the called party, and either:
a) the P‑CSCF FQDN that resolves to the IP address; or
b) the P‑CSCF IP address; and
5) for INVITE dialogs (i.e. dialogs initiated by an INVITE request), replace
the saved Contact and Cseq header filed values received in the request such
that the P‑CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
NOTE ~~5~~[7]{.underline}: The replaced Contact header field value is valid
only if a 1xx or 2xx response will be received for the request. In other cases
the old value is still valid.
before forwarding the request, based on the topmost Route header, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
When the P‑CSCF receives a 1xx or 2xx response to the above request, the
P‑CSCF shall:
1) [if a security association exists,]{.underline} rewrite the ~~the~~ address
and port number of its own Record Route entry to the same value as for the
response to the initial request for the dialog; and
2) replace the saved Contact header value received in the response such that
the P‑CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
before forwarding the response to the UE in accordance with the procedures of
RFC 3261 [26].
When the P‑CSCF receives from the UE the request for a standalone transaction,
and a Service-Route header list exists for the initiator of the request, the
P‑CSCF shall:
[0A) remove its own SIP URI from the top of the list of Route
headers;]{.underline}
1) verify that [the resulting list of Route headers matches]{.underline} the
list of URIs received in the Service-Route header (during the last successful
registration or re-registration) ~~matches the preloaded Route headers in the
received request~~. This verification is done on a per URI basis, not as a
whole string. If the verification fails, then the P‑CSCF shall either:
a) return a 400 (Bad Request) response; the P‑CSCF shall not forward the
request, and shall not continue with the execution of steps 3 onwards; or
b) replace the preloaded Route header value in the request with the one
received during the last registration in the Service-Route header of the 200
(OK) response;
2) if the P‑CSCF is located in the visited network, and local policy requires
IBCF capabilities in the visited network towards the home network, then the
P‑CSCF shall select an IBCF in the visited network and add the URI of the
selected IBCF to the topmost Route header;
NOTE ~~6~~[8]{.underline}: It is implementation dependent as to how the P‑CSCF
obtains the address of the IBCF exit point.
3) remove the P-Preferred-Identity header, if present, and insert a
P-Asserted-Identity header with a value, including the display name if
previously stored during registration, representing the initiator of the
request; and
4) add a P‑Charging-Vector header with the icid parameter populated as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17];
[4A) if the identity of the initiator of the request was taken from
P-Preferred-Identity header field by it matching a registered wildcarded
public user identity and the P-CSCF supports the SIP P-Profile-Key private

P-Profile-Key header field as defined in RFC 5002 [97]; and]{.underline}
before forwarding the request, based on the topmost Route header, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
When the P‑CSCF receives any response to the above request, the P‑CSCF shall:
1) store the values received in the P‑Charging-Function-Addresses header;
before forwarding the response to the UE in accordance with the procedures of
RFC 3261 [26].
When the P‑CSCF receives from the UE subsequent requests other than a target
refresh request (including requests relating to an existing dialog where the
method is unknown), the P‑CSCF shall:
1) verify if the request relates to a dialog in which the originator of the
request is involved:
a) if the request does not relates to an existing dialog in which the
originator is involved, then the P‑CSCF shall answer the request by sending a
403 (Forbidden) response back to the originator. The P‑CSCF will not forward
the request. No other actions are required; or

inverting the order of the stored list of Record-Route headers and removing
its Record-Route header from the list]{.underline} ~~for the same dialog~~.
This verification is done on a per URI basis, not as a whole string. If the
verification fails, then the P‑CSCF shall either:
a) return a 400 (Bad Request) response; the P‑CSCF shall not forward the
request, and shall not continue with the execution of steps 3 onwards; or
b) replace the Route header value in the request with the ~~stored~~ list of
Record-Route headers [constructed by inverting the order of the stored list of
Record-Route headers and removing its Record-Route header from the
list]{.underline} ~~for the same dialog~~;
3) for dialogs that are not INVITE dialogs, add a P‑Charging-Vector header
with the icid parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17]; and
4) for INVITE dialogs, replace the saved Cseq header value received in the
request such that the P‑CSCF is able to release the session if needed;
before forwarding the request, (based on the topmost Route header,) in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].
When the P‑CSCF receives from the UE the request for an unknown method (that
does not relate to an existing dialog), and a Service-Route header list exists
for the initiator of the request, the P‑CSCF shall:
1) verify that the list of URIs received in the Service-Route header (during
the last successful registration or re‑registration) is included, preserving
the same order, as a subset of the preloaded Route headers in the received
request. This verification is done on a per URI basis, not as a whole string.
If the verification fails, then the P‑CSCF shall either:

##### 5.2.7.2 UE-originating case {#ue-originating-case .H6}
When the P‑CSCF receives from the UE an INVITE request, the P‑CSCF may require
the periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the P‑CSCF. If
the P‑CSCF requires the session to be refreshed, it shall apply the procedures
described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least one
of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at least
one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
The P‑CSCF shall respond to all INVITE requests with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response.
[If a PCRF exists for the user for which a request is received,
the]{.underline} P‑CSCF shall also include the\ access-network-charging-info

traverses the P‑CSCF, as soon as the charging information is available in the
P‑CSCF, e.g., after the local resource reservation is complete. Typically,
this first request is an UPDATE request if the remote UA supports the
\"integration of resource management in SIP\" extension or a re-INVITE request
if the remote UA does not support the \"integration of resource management in
SIP\" extension. See subclause 5.2.7.4 for further information on the access

interfaces) in the P‑Charging-Vector header in the first request or
[reliable]{.underline} response originated by the UE that traverses the
P‑CSCF, as soon as the charging information is available in the P‑CSCF e.g.,
after the local resource reservation is complete. ~~Typically, this first
response is a 180 (Ringing) or 200 (OK) response if the remote UA supports the
\"integration of resource management in SIP\" extension, or a re-INVITE
request if the remote UA does not support the \"integration of resource
management in SIP\" extension.~~ See subclause 5.2.7.4 for further information
on the access network charging information.

request to cancel the INVITE request towards the terminating UE that includes
a Reason header containing a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code according
to the procedures described in RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 3326 [34A]; and
2) if the P‑CSCF serves the called user of the session, send out a 503
(Service Unavailable) response to the received INVITE request.
Upon receipt of an indication that QoS resources are no longer available for a
multimedia session currently being established (e.g. abort session request
from PCRF), [or of an indication that bearer resources are no longer available
for a multimedia session currently being established (e.g. abort session
request received from SPDF over the Gq\' interface),]{.underline} the P‑CSCF
shall cancel that dialog by responding to the original INVITE request with a
503 (Service Unavailable) response, and by sending out a CANCEL request to the
INVITE request towards the terminating UE that includes a Reason header

##### 5.2.8.1.4 Release of the existing dialogs due to registration expiration
and deletion of the security association {#release-of-the-existing-dialogs-
due-to-registration-expiration-and-deletion-of-the-security-association .H6}
If there are still active dialogs associated with the user after the security
associations were deleted, the P‑CSCF shall discard all information pertaining
to these dialogs without performing any further SIP transactions with the peer
entities of the P‑CSCF.
NOTE: At the same time, the P‑CSCF will also indicate via the Rx or Gx [or
Gq\']{.underline} interface that the session has been terminated.
##### 5.2.8.3 Session expiration {#session-expiration .H6}
If the P‑CSCF requested the session to be refreshed periodically, and the
P‑CSCF got the indication that the session will be refreshed, when the session
timer expires, the P‑CSCF shall delete all the stored information related to
the dialog.
NOTE: The P‑CSCF will also indicate to the IP‑CAN, via the Rx or Gx [or
Gq\']{.underline} interface, that the session has terminated.
##### 5.2.10.1 General {#general-6 .H6}
If the P‑CSCF belongs to a network where the registration is not required to
obtain emergency service, the P‑CSCF shall accept any unprotected request on
the IP address and port advertised to the UE during the P‑CSCF discovery
procedure. The P‑CSCF shall also accept any unprotected request on the same IP
address and the default port as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
The P‑CSCF can handle emergency session and other requests from both a
registered user as well as an unregistered user. Certain networks only allow
emergency session from registered users.
> ~~NOTE 1: If only emergency setup from registered users is allowed, a
> request from an unregistered user is ignored since it is received outside of
> the security association.~~
[The P-CSCF can handle emergency session establishment within a non-emergency
registration, i.e. one that did not contain the \"sos\" SIP URI parameter in
the Contact header field of the 200 (OK) response.]{.underline}
[Upon receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request that completes
the emergency registration, as identified by the presence of the \"sos\" SIP
URI parameter in the Contact header field of the 200 (OK) response,
t]{.underline}~~T~~he P‑CSCF shall not subscribe to the
reg[istration]{.underline} event package [of the]{.underline}~~for any
emergency~~ public user identity [specified in the REGISTER
request]{.underline}.
The P‑CSCF shall store a configurable list of local emergency service
identifiers, i.e. emergency numbers and the emergency service
URN[s]{.underline}, which [can be resolved in the network]{.underline}~~are
valid for the operator~~ to which the P‑CSCF belongs to. In addition to that,
the P‑CSCF shall store a configurable list of roaming partners\' emergency
service identifiers.
NOTE ~~2~~[1]{.underline}: The emergency service URN ~~are~~ [is]{.underline}
common to all networks, although subtypes may either not necessarily be in
use, or a different set of subtypes is in use [in different
networks]{.underline}. The above requirements do not apply to subtypes of the
emergency service URN.
~~Access technology specific procedures are described in each access
technology specific annex to determine whether the initial request for a
dialog or standalone transaction or an unknown method is destined for a
PSAP.~~
~~NOTE 3[2]{.underline}: Depending on local operator policy, the P‑CSCF has
the capability to reject requests relating to specific methods in accordance
with RFC 3261 [26], as an alternative to the functionality described above.~~
~~When the P‑CSCF responds that the CS domain is to be used for emergency call
the P‑CSCF shall include in the 380 (Alternative Service) response a Content-
Type header field with the value set to associated MIME type of the 3GPP IMS
XML body as described in subclause 7.6.1.~~
~~The P‑CSCF shall include in the 3GPP IMS XML body:~~
~~a) an \ element, set to the parameters of the
alternative service:~~
~~b) a \ child element, set to \"emergency\" to indicate that it was an
emergency call; and~~
~~c) a \ child element, set to an operator configurable reason.~~
~~The P‑CSCF can handle emergency session establishment within a non-emergency
registration.~~
~~When the P‑CSCF responds that an emergency registration is required the
P‑CSCF shall include in the 380 (Alternative Service) response a Content-Type
header field with the value set to associated MIME type of the 3GPP IMS XML
body as described in subclause 7.6.1. The P‑CSCF shall include in the 3GPP IMS
XML body:~~
~~a) an \ element, set to the parameters of the
alternative service;~~
~~b) a \ child element, set to \"emergency\" to indicate that it was an
emergency call; and~~
~~c) an \ child element, set to \"emergency-registration\" to indicate
that emergency registration is required; and~~
~~d) a \ child element, set to an operator configurable reason.~~
~~NOTE 4: \ element is used only in a context to indicate the UE that
emergency registration is required in the present document. Therefore, this
element is defined as optional and shall not be used in other purpose.~~
~~NOTE 5: This response is only sent in case if the P‑CSCF received an
explicit indication from the UE that it is an emergency session, i.e. receive
emergency service URN in the Request-URI.~~
For all SIP transactions identified as relating to an emergency, the P‑CSCF
shall give priority over other transactions. This allows special treatment
(e.g. with respect to filtering, higher priority, routeing) of emergency
sessions. The exact meaning of priority is not defined further in this
document, but is left to national regulation and network configuration.
##### 5.2.10.2 General treatment for all dialogs and standalone transactions
excluding the REGISTER method - from an unregistered user {#general-treatment-
for-all-dialogs-and-standalone-transactions-excluding-the-register-method---
from-an-unregistered-user .H6}
If the P-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone
transaction, or an unknown method for an unregistered user on the IP address
and the unprotected port advertised to the UE during the P-CSCF discovery or
the SIP default port, the P-CSCF shall inspect the Request URI independent of
values of possible entries in the received Route headers for known emergency
service identifiers, i.e. emergency numbers and the emergency service URN from
the configurable lists.
If the P-CSCF detects that the Request-URI of the initial request for a dialog
or standalone transaction, or unknown method matches one of the emergency
service identifiers in any of these lists, the P-CSCF shall:
1) include in the Request-URI an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN
with a top-level service type of \"sos\" in accordance with draft-ietf-ecrit-
service-urn [69]. [If information on the type of emergency service is known
include a]{.underline}~~An additional~~ sub-service type ~~can be added if
information on the type of emergency service is known~~. The entry in the
Request-URI that the P-CSCF includes [shall]{.underline}~~may either~~ be:
\- as received in the Request URI from the UE in accordance with draft-ietf-
ecrit-service-urn [69]; or
\- as deduced from the Request-URI received from the UE;
2) select an E-CSCF and add the URI of the selected E-CSCF to the topmost
Route header; and
NOTE 1: How the list of E-CSCF is obtained by the P-CSCF is implementation
dependent.
3) execute the procedure described in subclause 5.2.6.3 dealing with the
procedure when the P-CSCF receives an initial request from the UE and
subclause 5.2.7.2 except for:
\- verifying the preloaded route against the received Service-Route header;
\- removing the P-Preferred-Identity header; and
\- inserting a P-Asserted-Identity header.
When the P-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the above requests, the
P-CSCF shall execute the appropriate procedure for the type of request
described in subclause 5.2.6.3, except that the P-CSCF may rewrite the port
number of its own Record-Route entry to an unprotected port where the P-CSCF
wants to receive the subsequent incoming requests from the UE belonging to
this dialog.
If the P-CSCF does not receive any response to the initial request for a
dialog or standalone transaction or unknown method (including its
retransmissions); or receives a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable)
response to an INVITE request, the P-CSCF shall select a new IBCF or E-CSCF
and forward the request.
When the P-CSCF receives a target refresh request from the UE for a dialog,
the P-CSCF shall execute the procedure described in step 1) to 5), in
paragraph of subclause 5.2.6.3 describing the procedure when the P-CSCF
receives a target refresh request.
When the P-CSCF receives from the UE subsequent requests other than a target
refresh request (including requests relating to an existing dialog where the
method is unknown), the P-CSCF shall execute the procedure described in step
1) to 4), in the paragraph of subclause 5.2.6.3 describing the procedure when
the P-CSCF receives a subsequent request.
When the P-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the above requests, the
P-CSCF shall execute the appropriate procedure for the type of request
described in subclause 5.2.6.3.
When the P-CSCF receives, destined for the UE, a target refresh request for a
dialog, prior to forwarding the request, the P-CSCF shall execute the
procedure described in step 3, the paragraph of subclause 5.2.6.4 describing
when the P-CSCF receives a target refresh request.
When the P-CSCF receives a 1xx or 2xx response to the above request the P-CSCF
shall execute the procedure described in step 1) to 3) in the paragraph of
subclause 5.2.6.4 describing when the P-CSCF receives 1xx or 2xx response to a
target request.
When the P-CSCF receives any other response to the above request the P-CSCF
shall execute the procedure described in step 1) to 2) in the paragraph of
subclause 5.2.6.4 describing when the P-CSCF receives any other response to a
target request.
When the P-CSCF receives, destined for the UE, a subsequent request for a
dialog that is not a target refresh request (including requests relating to an
existing dialog where the method is unknown), prior to forwarding the request,
the P-CSCF shall execute the procedure described in steps 2 and 3 of subclause
5.2.6.4 describing when a P-CSCF receives a subsequent request.
When the P-CSCF receives any other response to the above request the P-CSCF
shall execute the procedure described in step 1 in the paragraph of subclause
5.2.6.4 describing when the P-CSCF receives any other response to a subsequent
request.

excluding the REGISTER method after emergency registration {#general-
treatment-for-all-dialogs-and-standalone-transactions-excluding-the-register-
method-after-emergency-registration .H6}
If the P‑CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog, or a standalone
transaction, or an unknown method, for a registered user ~~over the security
association that was created during the emergency registration[, as identified
by the presence of the \"sos\" SIP URI parameter in the Contact header field
of the 200 (OK) response]{.underline}~~, the P‑CSCF shall inspect the Request
URI independent of values of possible entries in the received Route headers
for known emergency service identifiers~~, i.e. emergency numbers and the
emergency service URN from these configurable lists~~. [The P-CSCF shall
consider the Request URI of the initial request as an emergency service
identifier if it is an emergency number or an emergency service URN from the
configurable lists that are associated with:]{.underline}
[the country of the operator to which the P-CSCF belongs to; and]{.underline}
[- for inbound roamers, the country from which the UE is roaming from. The
P-CSCF determines the country to which the UE is belonging to based on the
content of the P-Assserted-Identity header field which contains the home
network domain name in a SIP URI belonging to the user.]{.underline}
If the P‑CSCF detects that the Request-URI of the initial request for a
dialog, or a standalone transaction, or an unknown method does not match any
one of the emergency service identifiers in ~~any of these~~ the associated
lists, the P‑CSCF shall reject the request by returning a 403 (Forbidden)
response to the UE.
If the P‑CSCF detects that the Request-URI of the initial request for a
dialog, or a standalone transaction, or an unknown method matches one of the
emergency service identifiers in ~~any of these~~ the associated lists, the
P‑CSCF shall:
1) include in the Request-URI an emergency service URN, i.e. with a service
type of \"sos\" as specified in RFC 5031 [69], if necessary, and execute the
procedure described in step 3, 4, 5, and 6, in subclause 5.2.6.3 dealing with
the procedure when the P‑CSCF receives an initial request from the UE. [If
information on the type of emergency service is known include a sub-service
type.]{.underline} The entry in the Request-URI that the P‑CSCF includes ~~may
either~~[shall]{.underline} be:
\- as received from the UE in the Request URI in accordance with RFC 5031
[69]; or
\- as deduced from the Request-URI received from the UE.
2) if the request contains a Contact header field containing a GRUU the P‑CSCF
shall save the GRUU received in the Contact header field of the request and
associate it with the UE IP address and UE ~~protected~~ server port, ~~for
the security association on which the request was received~~ such that the
P‑CSCF is able to route target refresh request containing that GRUU in the
Request-URI; and
In addition the P‑CSCF shall execute the procedures as specified in subclause
5.2 with the following additions:
3) the P‑CSCF shall [ ]{.underline} ~~:~~
~~- if the registered emergency public user identity is included in the
P-Preferred-Identity header, remove the P-Preferred-Identity header from the
received request and insert a P-Asserted-Identity header that includes the
emergency public user identity that was present in the P-Preferred-Identity
header. Add a second P-Asserted identity header that contains the tel URI
associated with the emergency public user identity. If the tel URI associated
with the registered emergency public user identity is included in the\
P-Preferred-Identity header, check the validity of the tel URI, remove the
P-Preferred-Identity header and insert a P-Asserted-Identity header that
includes the tel URI that was present in the P-Preferred-Identity header. Add
a second P-Asserted-Identity header that contains the emergency public user
identity; and~~
~~-~~ select an E-CSCF and add the URI of the selected E-CSCF to the topmost
Route header.
NOTE: It is implementation dependant as to how the P‑CSCF obtains the list of
E-CSCFs.
If the P‑CSCF does not receive any response to the INVITE request (including
its retransmissions); or receives a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily
Unavailable) response to an INVITE request, the P‑CSCF shall select a new
E-CSCF and forward the INVITE request.
When the P‑CSCF receives a target refresh request for a dialog with the
Request-URI containing a GRUU the P‑CSCF shall:
\- obtain the UE IP address and UE protected server port related to the GRUU
contained in the Request-URI and rewrite the Request-URI with that UE IP
address and UE protected server port; and
\- perform the steps in subclause 5.2.6.4 for when the P‑CSCF receives,
destined for the UE, a target refresh request for a dialog.

address and UE protected server port; and
\- perform the steps in subclause 5.2.6.4 for when the P-CSCF receives,
destined for the UE, a target refresh request for a dialog.
###### 5.2.10.5 Abnormal cases
If the IM CN subsystem to where the P-CSCF belongs to is not capable to handle
emergency sessions or due to local policy does not handle emergency sessions
or only handles certain type of emergency session request [or does not support
emergency sessions for either the geographical location of the UE or the IP-
CAN to which the UE is attached]{.underline}, the P-CSCF shall not forward the
INVITE request. The P-CSCF
I) shall respond to the INVITE request with a 380 (Alternative Service)

7.7AB)]{.underline} if the [P-CSCF is accordingly configured by the
operator]{.underline}~~request included an emergency service URN in the
Request-URI~~.
[NOTE 1: Emergency service URN in the request-URI indicates for the network
that the emergency call attempt is recognized by the UE.]{.underline}
NOTE[ 2]{.underline}: Some networks only allow session requests with a
Request-URI containing an emergency service URN, i.e. a service URN with a
top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in draft-ietf-ecrit-service-urn
[69].
##### 5.3.2.1 Normal procedures {#normal-procedures .H6}
The I-CSCF may behave as a stateful proxy for initial requests.
Upon receipt of a request, the I-CSCF shall perform the originating procedures
as described in subclause 5.3.2.1A if the topmost Route header of the request
contains the \"orig\" parameter. Otherwise, the I-CSCF shall continue with the
rest of the procedures of this subclause.
When the I-CSCF receives a request, the I-CSCF shall verify whether it has
arrived from a trusted domain or not. If the request has arrived from a non
trusted domain, then the I-CSCF shall remove ~~all P-Asserted-Identity
headers, all P-Access-Network-Info headers,~~ all P-Charging-Vector headers
and all P-Charging-Function-Addresses headers the request may contain.
NOTE 1: The I-CSCF can find out whether the request arrived from a trusted
domain or not, from the procedures described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [19A].
The I-CSCF shall discard the P-Profile Key header, if the I-CSCF receives the
Profile Key header in a SIP request or response.
When the I-CSCF receives, destined for a server user or a PSI, an initial
request for a dialog or standalone transaction the I-CSCF shall:
1) if the Request-URI includes:
a) a pres: or an im: URI, then translate the pres: or im: URI to a public user
identity and replace the Request-URI of the incoming request with that public
user identity; or
b) a SIP-URI that is not a GRUU and with the user part starting with a \+ and
the user parameter equals \"phone\" then replace the Request-URI with a tel-
URI with the user part of the SIP-URI in the telephone-subscriber element in
the tel-URI; or
c) a SIP URI that is a GRUU, then obtain the public user identity from the
Request-URI and use it for location query procedure to the HSS. When
forwarding the request, the I-CSCF shall not modify the Request-URI of the
incoming request;
~~NOTE 2: If the Request-URI is a GRUU with the user part starting with a +
and the user parameter equals \"phone\", the I-CSCF builds a tel URI from the
user part and uses it only to query the HSS. Subsequently, when the I-CSCF
forwards the request to the S-CSCF, it will not modify the Request-URI.~~
NOTE 3: SRV records have to be advertised in DNS pointing to the I-CSCF for
pres: and im: queries.
2) remove a Route header, if present; and
3) check if the domain name of the Request-URI matches with one of the PSI
subdomains configured in the I-CSCF. If the match is successful, the I-CSCF
resolves the Request-URI by an internal DNS mechanism into the IP address of
the AS hosting the PSI and does not start the user location query procedure.
Otherwise, the I-CSCF will start the user location query procedure to the HSS
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] for the called PSI or user, indicated in
or derived from the Request-URI. Prior to performing the user location query
procedure to the HSS, the I-CSCF decides which HSS to query, possibly as a
result of a query to the Subscription Locator Functional (SLF) entity as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14].
When the I-CSCF receives any response to such a request, the I-CSCF shall
store the value of the term-ioi parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector
header, if present.
NOTE 4: Any received term-ioi parameter will be a type 3 term-ioi. The type 3
term-ioi identifies the service provider from which the response was sent.
When the I-CSCF receives an INVITE request, the I-CSCF may require the
periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the I-CSCF. If the
I-CSCF requires the session to be refreshed, it shall apply the procedures
described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 5: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
In case the I-CSCF is able to resolve the Request-URI into the IP address of
the AS hosting the PSI, then it shall:
1) store the value of the icid parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector
header and retain the icid parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header. If no
icid parameter was found, then create a new, globally unique value for the
icid parameter and insert it into the P-Charging-Vector header; and
2) forward the request directly to the AS hosting the PSI.
Upon successful user location query, when the response contains the URI of the
assigned S-CSCF, the I-CSCF shall:
1) insert the URI received from the HSS as the topmost Route header;
2) store the value of the icid parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector
header and retain the icid parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header. If no
icid parameter was found, then create a new, globally unique value for the
icid parameter and insert it into the P-Charging-Vector header. The I-CSCF
shall add a type 3 orig-ioi parameter before the received orig-ioi parameter.
The I-CSCF shall set the type 3 orig-ioi parameter to a value that identifies
the sending network of the request. The I-CSCF shall not include the type 3
term-ioi parameter;
3) optionally, include the received Redirect-Host AVP value in the P-User-
Database header as defined in RFC 4457 [82]; and
4) forward the request based on the topmost Route header.
NOTE 6: The P-User-Database header can be included only if the I-CSCF can
assume (e.g. based on local configuration) that the receiving S-CSCF will be
able to process the header.
Upon successful user location query, when the response contains information
about the required S-CSCF capabilities, the I-CSCF shall:
1) select a S-CSCF according to the method described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14];
2) insert the URI of the selected S-CSCF as the topmost Route header field
value;
3) execute the procedure described in step 2 and 3 in the above paragraph
(upon successful user location query, when the response contains the URI of
the assigned S-CSCF);
4) optionally, include the received Redirect-Host AVP value in the P-User-
Database header as defined in RFC 4457 [82];
5) if the Wildcarded PSI value is received from the HSS in the Wildcarded-PSI
AVP [or a wildcarded public user identity value is received from the HSS in
the Wildcarded-IMPU AVP]{.underline} and the I-CSCF supports the the SIP
P-Profile-Key private header extension, include the wildcarded PSI value in
the P-Profile-Key header as defined in draft-camarillo-sipping-profile-key
[97]; and
6) forward the request to the selected S-CSCF.
NOTE 7: The P-User-Database header can be included only if the I-CSCF can
assume (e.g. based on local configuration) that the receiving S-CSCF will be
able to process the header.
Upon an unsuccessful user location query when the response from the HSS
indicates that the user does not exist, and if the Request-URI is a tel URI
containing a public telecommunications number as specified in RFC 3966 [22],
the I-CSCF may support a local configuration option that indicates whether or
not request routeing is to be attempted. If the local configuration option
indicates that request routeing is to be attempted, then the I-CSCF shall
perform one of the following procedures based on local operator policy:
1) forward the request to the transit functionality for subsequent routeing;
or
2) invoke the portion of the transit functionality that translates the public
telecommunications number contained in the Request-URI to a routeable SIP URI,
and process the request based on the result, as follows:
a) if the translation fails, the request may be forwarded to a BGCF or any
other appropriate entity (e.g. a MRFC to play an announcement) in the home
network, or the I-CSCF may send an appropriate SIP response to the originator,
such as 404 (Not Found) or 604 (Does not exist anywhere). When forwarding the
request to a BGCF or any other appropriate entity, the I-CSCF shall leave the
original Request-URI containing the tel URI unmodified; or
b) if this translation succeeds, then replace the Request-URI with the
routeable SIP URI and process the request as follows:
\- determine the destination address (e.g. DNS access) using the URI placed in
the topmost Route header if present, otherwise based on the Request-URI. If
the destination requires interconnect functionalities (e.g. the destination
address is of an IP address type other than the IP address type used in the IM
CN subsystem), the I-CSCF shall forward the request to the destination address
via an IBCF in the same network;
\- if network hiding is needed due to local policy, put the address of the
IBCF to the topmost route header; and
\- route the request based on SIP routeing procedures.
Upon an unsuccessful user location query when the response from the HSS
indicates that the user does not exist, and if local operator policy does not
indicate that request routeing is to be attempted, then, the I-CSCF shall
return an appropriate unsuccessful SIP response. This response may be a 404
(Not found) or 604 (Does not exist anywhere) in the case the user is not a
user of the home network.
Upon an unsuccessful user location query when the response from the HSS
indicates that the user is not registered and no services are provided for
such a user, the I-CSCF shall return an appropriate unsuccessful SIP response.
This response may be a 480 (Temporarily unavailable) response if the user is
recognized as a valid user, but is not registered at the moment and it does
not have services for unregistered users.
When the I-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone
transaction, that contains a single Route header pointing to itself, the
I-CSCF shall determine from the entry in the Route header whether it needs to
do HSS query. In case HSS query is needed, then the I-CSCF shall:
1) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header; and
2) route the request based on the Request-URI header field.
When the I-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone
transaction containing more than one Route header, the I-CSCF shall:
1) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header; and
2) forward the request based on the topmost Route header.
NOTE 8: In accordance with SIP the I-CSCF can add its own routeable SIP URI to
the top of the Record-Route header to any request, independently of whether it
is an initial request. The P-CSCF will ignore any Record-Route header that is
not in the initial request of a dialog.
When the I-CSCF receives a response to an initial request (e.g. 183 (Session
Progress) response or 2xx response), the I-CSCF shall store the values from
the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header, if present. If the next hop is
outside of the current network, then the I-CSCF shall remove the P-Charging-
Function-Addresses header prior to forwarding the message.
When the I-CSCF, upon sending an initial INVITE request to the S-CSCF,
receives a 305 (Use Proxy) response from the S-CSCF, it shall forward the
initial INVITE request to the SIP URI indicated in the Contact field of the
305 (Use Proxy) response, as specified in RFC 3261 [26].
#### 5.3.2.1A Originating procedures for requests containing the \"orig\"
parameter
The procedures of this subclause apply for requests received at the I-CSCF
when the topmost Route header of the request contains the \"orig\" parameter.
The I-CSCF shall verify for all requests whether they arrived from a trusted
domain or not. If the request arrived from a non trusted domain, then the
I-CSCF shall respond with 403 (Forbidden) response.
If the request arrived from a trusted domain, the I-CSCF shall perform the
procedures below.
NOTE 1: The I-CSCF can find out whether the request arrived from a trusted
domain or not, from the procedures described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [19A].
When the I-CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone
transaction the I-CSCF will start the user location query procedure to the HSS
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] for the calling user, indicated in the
P-Asserted-Identity header. Prior to performing the user location query
procedure to the HSS, the I-CSCF decides which HSS to query, possibly as a
result of a query to the Subscription Locator Functional (SLF) entity as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14].
When the I-CSCF receives an INVITE request, the I-CSCF may require the
periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the I-CSCF. If the
I-CSCF requires the session to be refreshed, it shall apply the procedures
described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 2: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
When the response for user location query contains information about the
required S-CSCF capabilities, the I-CSCF shall select a S-CSCF according to
the method described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14].
If the user location query was successful, the I-CSCF shall:
1) insert the URI of the S-CSCF - either received from the HSS, or selected by
the I-CSCF based on capabilities - as the topmost Route header appending the
\"orig\" parameter to the URI of the S-CSCF;
2) store the value of the icid parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector
header and retain the icid parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header. If no
icid parameter was found, then create a new, globally unique value for the
icid parameter and insert it into the P-Charging-Vector header;
3) optionally, include the received Redirect-Host AVP value in the P-User-
Database header as defined in draft-camarillo-sipping-user-database [82]
[3a) if a wildcarded public user identity value is received from the HSS in
the Wildcarded-IMPU AVP and the I-CSCF supports the the SIP P-Profile-Key
private header extension, include the wildcarded public user identity value in
the P-Profile-Key header as defined in RFC 5002 [97]; and]{.underline}
[]{.underline}
4) forward the request based on the topmost Route header.
NOTE 3: The P-User-Database header can be included only if the I-CSCF can
assume (e.g. based on local configuration) that the receiving S-CSCF will be
able to process the header.
Upon an unsuccessful user location query, the I-CSCF shall return an
appropriate unsuccessful SIP response. This response may be a 404 (Not found)
response or 604 (Does not exist anywhere) response in the case the user is not
a user of the home network.
When the I-CSCF receives any response to the above request, and forwards it to
AS, the I-CSCF shall:
\- store the values from the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header, if present.
If the next hop is outside of the current network, then the I-CSCF shall
remove the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header prior to forwarding the
message; and
\- insert a P-Charging-Vector header containing the type 3 orig-ioi parameter,
if received in the request, and a type 3 term-ioi parameter in the response.
The I-CSCF shall set the type 3 term-ioi parameter to a value that identifies
the sending network of the response and the type 3 orig-ioi parameter is set
to the previously received value of type 3 orig-ioi.
##### 5.4.1.1 Introduction {#introduction .H6}
The S‑CCF shall act as the SIP registrar for all UAs belonging to the IM CN
subsystem and with public user identities.
Subclause 5.4.1.2 through subclause 5.4.1.7 define S‑CCF procedures for SIP
registration that do not relate to emergency. All registration requests are
first screened according to the procedures of subclause 5.4.8.2 to see if they
do relate to an emergency [registration]{.underline}~~public user identity~~.
The S‑CCF shall support the use of the Path and Service-Route header. The
S‑CCF shall also support the Require and Supported headers. The Path header is
only applicable to the REGISTER request and its 200 (OK) response. The
Service-Route header is only applicable to the 200 (OK) response of REGISTER.
The S‑CCF shall not act as a redirect server for REGISTER requests.
The network operator defines minimum and maximum times for each registration.
These values are provided within the S‑CCF.
The procedures for notification concerning automatically registered public
user identities of a user are described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2.
In case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided
by a NA(P)T or NA(P)T-PT, the S‑CCF may need to modify the SIP signalling
according to the procedures described in annex K if both a reg-id and instance
ID parameter are present in the received contact header as described in draft-
ieft-outbound [92].
[The S‑CCF shall determine based on the contents of the REGISTER request
whether procedure for IMS-AKA authentication are to be performed or
not:]{.underline}
\- [if the REGISTER request contains an Authorization header field with the
"integrity-protected" parameter, the S‑CCF shall perform the initial
registration procedures with IMS-AKA authentication described in subclause
5.4.1.2.1;]{.underline}
\- [otherwise (i.e. no Authorization header field is present, or Authorization
header field is received without the \"integrity-protected\" parameter), the
S‑CCF shall perform the initial registration procedures as described in
subclause 5.4.1.2A.]{.underline}
##### 5.4.1.2 Initial registration and user-initiated reregistration [with
IMS-AKA authentication]{.underline} {#initial-registration-and-user-initiated-
reregistration-with-ims-aka-authentication .H6}
##### 5.4.1.2.1 Unprotected REGISTER {#unprotected-register .H6}
NOTE 1: Any REGISTER request sent unprotected [with the \"integrity-
protected\" parameter in the Authorization header set to \"no\"]{.underline}
by the UE is considered to be an initial registration. A 200 (OK) final
response to such a request will only be sent back after the S‑CCF receives a
correct authentication challenge response in a REGISTER request that is sent
integrity protected.
NOTE 2: A REGISTER with Expires header value equal to zero should always be
received protected. However, it is possible that in error conditions a
REGISTER with Expires header value equal to zero may be received unprotected.
In that instance the procedures below will be applied.
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request ~~without an \"integrity-protected\"
parameter, or~~ with the \"integrity-protected\" parameter in the
Authorization header set to \"no\", for a user identity linked to a private
user identity that has a registered public user identity but with a new
contact address, the S‑CCF shall:
1) perform the procedure for receipt of a REGISTER request ~~without an
\"integrity-protected\" parameter, or~~ with the \"integrity-protected\"
parameter in the Authorization header set to \"no\"\', for the received public
user identity; and
2) if the authentication has been successful, and there are public user
identities belonging to this user that have been previously registered with an
old contact address different from the one received in the REGISTER request
and the previous registrations have not expired, the S‑CCF shall perform the
network initiated deregistration procedure for the previously registered
public user identities and the associated old contact address as described in
subclause 5.4.1.5.
NOTE 3: Contact related to emergency registration is not affected. S‑CCF is
not able deregister contact related to emergency registration and will not
delete that.
When S‑CCF receives a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-protected\"
parameter in the Authorization header set to \"no\" and a non-empty response
directive, the S‑CCF shall ignore the value of the response directive.
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request ~~without an \"integrity-protected\"
parameter, or~~ with the \"integrity-protected\" parameter in the
Authorization header set to \"no\", which is not for an already registered
public user identity linked to the same private user identity, the S‑CCF
shall:
1) identify the user by the public user identity as received in the To header
and the private user identity as received in the username field in the
Authorization header of the REGISTER request;
2) check if the P-Visited-Network header is included in the REGISTER request,
and if it is included identify the visited network by the value of this
header;
3) select an authentication vector for the user. If no authentication vector
for this user is available, after the S‑CCF has performed the Cx Multimedia
Authentication procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14],
the S‑CCF shall select an authentication vector as described in 3GPP TS 33.203
[19].
Prior to performing Cx Multimedia Authentication procedure with the HSS, the
S‑CCF decides which HSS to query, possibly as a result of a query to the
Subscription Locator Functional (SLF) entity as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228
[14] or use the value as received in the P-User-Database header in the
REGISTER request as defined in RFC 4457 [82];
NOTE 4: The HSS address received in the response to SLF query or as a value of
P-User-Database header can be used to address the HSS of the public user
identity in further queries.
NOTE 5: At this point the S‑CCF informs the HSS that the user currently
registering will be served by the S‑CCF by passing its SIP URI to the HSS.
This will be used by the HSS to direct all subsequent incoming initial
requests for a dialog or standalone transactions destined for this user to
this S‑CCF.
NOTE 6: When passing its SIP URI to the HSS, the S‑CCF may include in its SIP
URI the transport protocol and the port number where it wants to be contacted.
4) store the icid parameter received in the P‑Charging-Vector header;
5) challenge the user by generating a 401 (Unauthorized) response for the
received REGISTER request, including a WWW-Authenticate header which
transports:
\- a globally unique name of the S‑CCF in the realm field;
\- the RAND and AUTN parameters and optional server specific data for the UE
in the nonce field;
\- the security mechanism, which is AKAv1-MD5, in the algorithm field;
\- the IK (Integrity Key) parameter for the P‑CSCF in the ik field (see
subclause 7.2A.1); and
\- the CK (Cipher Key) parameter for the P‑CSCF in the ck field (see subclause
7.2A.1);
6) store the RAND parameter used in the 401 (Unauthorized) response for future
use in case of a resynchronization. If a stored RAND already exists in the
S‑CCF, the S‑CCF shall overwrite the stored RAND with the RAND used in the
most recent 401 (Unauthorized) response;
7) send the so generated 401 (Unauthorized) response towards the UE; and,
8) start timer reg-await-auth which guards the receipt of the next REGISTER
request.
If the received REGISTER request indicates that the challenge sent previously
by the S‑CCF to the UE was deemed to be invalid by the UE, the S‑CCF shall
stop the timer reg-await-auth and proceed as described in the subclause
5.4.1.2.3.
##### 5.4.1.2.2 Protected REGISTER
Upon receipt of a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-protected\" parameter
in the Authorization header set to \"yes\", the S-CSCF shall identify the user
by the public user identity as received in the To header and the private user
identity as received in the Authorization header of the REGISTER request, and:
In the case that there is no authentication currently ongoing for this user
(i.e. no timer reg-await-auth is running):
1) check if the user needs to be reauthenticated.
> The S-CSCF may require authentication of the user for any REGISTER request,
> and shall always require authentication for REGISTER requests received
> without the \"integrity-protected\" parameter in the Authorization header
> set to \"yes\".
>
> If the user needs to be reauthenticated, the S-CSCF shall proceed with the
> procedures as described for the un[protected]{.underline} ~~initial~~
> REGISTER in subclause 5.4.1.2.1, beginning with step [3]{.underline}~~4~~).
> If the user does not need to be reauthenticated, the S-CSCF shall proceed
> with the following steps in this paragraph; and
2) check whether an Expires timer is included in the REGISTER request and its
value. If the Expires header indicates a zero value, the S-CSCF shall perform
the deregistration procedures as described in subclause 5.4.1.4. If the
Expires header does not indicate zero, the S-CSCF shall check whether the
public user identity received in the To header is already registered. If it is
not registered, the S-CSCF shall proceed beginning with step 5 below.
Otherwise, the S-CSCF shall proceed beginning with step 6 below.
In the case that a timer reg-await-auth is running for this user the S-CSCF
shall:
1) check if the Call-ID of the request matches with the Call-ID of the 401
(Unauthorized) response which carried the last challenge. The S-CSCF shall
only proceed further if the Call-IDs match.
2) stop timer reg-await-auth;
3) check whether an Authorization header is included, containing:
a) the private user identity of the user in the username field;
b) the algorithm which is AKAv1-MD5 in the algorithm field; and
c) the authentication challenge response needed for the authentication
procedure in the response field.
> The S-CSCF shall only proceed with the following steps in this paragraph if
> the authentication challenge response was included;
4) check whether the received authentication challenge response and the
expected authentication challenge response (calculated by the S-CSCF using
XRES and other parameters as described in RFC 3310 [49]) match. The XRES
parameter was received from the HSS as part of the Authentication Vector. The
S-CSCF shall only proceed with the following steps if the challenge response
received from the UE and the expected response calculated by the S-CSCF match;
5) after performing the Cx Server Assignment procedure with the HSS, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], store the following information in the local
data:
a) the list of public user identities, including the registered own public
user identity and its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities [and wildcarded public user identities]{.underline} due to the
received REGISTER request. Each public user identity is identified as either
barred or non-barred; and,
b) all the service profile(s) corresponding to the public user identities
being registered (explicitly or implicitly), including initial Filter
Criteria(the initial Filter Criteria for the Registered and common parts is
stored and the unregisterd part is retained for possible use later - in the
case of the S-CSCF is retained if the user becomes unregistered);
NOTE 1: There might be more than one set of initial Filter Criteria received
because some implicitly registered public user identities that are part of the
same implicit registration set belong to different service profiles.
6) update registration bindings:
a) bind to each non-barred registered public user identity all registered
contact information including all header parameters contained in the Contact
header and all associated URI parameters, with the exception of the URI \"pub-
gruu\" and \"temp-gruu\" parameters as specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93],
and store information for future use;
b) for each binding that contains a +sip.instance header parameter, assign a
new temporary GRUU, as specified in subclause 5.4.7A.3.
NOTE 2: There might be more then one contact information available for one
public user identity.
NOTE 3: The barred public user identities are not bound to the contact
information.
7) check whether a Path header was included in the REGISTER request and
construct a list of preloaded Route headers from the list of entries in the
received Path header. The S-CSCF shall preserve the order of the preloaded
Route headers and bind them to the contact information that was received in
the REGISTER message;
NOTE 4: If this registration is a reregistration or an initial registration
(i.e., there are previously registered public user identities belonging to the
user that have not been deregistered or expired), then a list of pre-loaded
Route headers will already exist. The new list replaces the old list.
8) determine the duration of the registration by checking the value of the
Expires header in the received REGISTER request. The S-CSCF may reduce the
duration of the registration due to local policy or send back a 423 (Interval
Too Brief) response specifying the minimum allowed time for registration;
9) store the icid parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header;
10) if an orig-ioi parameter is received in the P-Charging-Vector header,
store the value of the received orig-ioi parameter;
NOTE 5: Any received orig-ioi parameter will be a type 1 orig-ioi. The type 1
orig-ioi identifies the network from which the request was sent.
11) create a 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request, including:
a) the list of received Path headers;
b) a P-Associated-URI header containing the list of the registered public user
identity and its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities. The first URI in the list of public user identities supplied by
the HSS to the S-CSCF will indicate the default public user identity to be
used by the S-CSCF. The public user identity indicated as the default public
user identity must be a registered public user identity. The S-CSCF shall
place the default public user identity as the first entry in the list of URIs
present in the P-Associated-URI header. The default public user identity will
be used by the P-CSCF in conjunction with the procedures for the P-Asserted-
Identity header, as described in subclause 5.2.6.3. If the S-CSCF received a
display name from the HSS for a public user identity, then it shall populate
the P-Associated-URI header entry for that public identity with the associated
display name. The S-CSCF shall not add a barred public user identity to the
list of URIs in the P-Associated-URI header;
NOTE 6: The P-Associated-URI header lists only the public user identity and
its associated set of implicitly registered public user identities that have
been registered, rather than the list of user\'s URIs that may be either
registered or unregistered as specified in the RFC 3455 [52]. If the
registered public user identity which is not barred does not have any other
associated public user identities, the P-Associated-URI header lists only the
registered public user identity itself, rather than an empty P-Associated-URI
header as specified in RFC 3455 [52].
c) a Service-Route header containing:
\- the SIP URI identifying the S-CSCF containing an indication that requests
routed via the service route (i.e. from the P-CSCF to the S-CSCF) are treated
as for the UE-originating case. This indication may e.g. be in a URI
parameter, a character string in the user part of the URI or be a port number
in the URI; and,
\- if network topology hiding is required a SIP URI identifying an IBCF as the
topmost entry;
[NOTE 7: In accordance with the procedures described in RFC 3608 [38], an IBCF
does not insert its own routable SIP URI to the Service-Route header
field.]{.underline}
d) a P-Charging-Function-Addresses header containing the values received from
the HSS if the P-CSCF is in the same network as the S-CSCF. It can be
determined if the P-CSCF is in the same network as the S-CSCF by the contents
of the P-Visited-Network-ID header field included in the REGISTER request;
e) a P-Charging-Vector header containing the orig-ioi parameter, if received
in the REGISTER request and a type 1 term-ioi parameter. The S-CSCF shall set
the type 1 term-ioi parameter to a value that identifies the sending network
of the response and the orig-ioi parameter is set to the previously received
value of orig-ioi;
f) a Contact header listing all contact addresses for this public user
identity, including all saved header and URI parameters (including all ICSI
values and IARI values) received in the Contact header field of the REGISTER
request, and
g) gruus in the Contact header. If the REGISTER request contained a Required
or Supported header containing the value \"gruu\" then for each contact
address in the contact header that has a +sip.instance header parameter, add
\"pub-gruu\" and \"temp-gruu\" header parameters. The values of these
parameters shall contain, respectively, the public GRUU and the most recently
assigned temporary GRUU representing (as specified in subclause 5.4.7A) the
association between the public user identity from the To header in the
REGISTER request and the instance ID contained in the +sip.instance parameter.
NOTE [8]{.underline}~~7~~: There might be other contact addresses available,
that other UEs have registered for the same public user identity.
12) send the so created 200 (OK) response to the UE;
13) for all service profiles in the implicit registration set send a third-
party REGISTER request, as described in subclause 5.4.1.7, to each AS that
matches the Filter Criteria of the service profile from the HSS for the
REGISTER event; and,
NOTE [9]{.underline}~~8~~: If this registration is a reregistration, the
Filter Criteria already exists in the local data.
NOTE [10]{.underline}~~9~~: If the same AS matches the Filter Criteria of
several service profiles for the event of REGISTER request, then the AS will
receive several third-party REGISTER requests. Each of these requests will
include a public user identity from the corresponding service profile.
14) consider the public user identity being registered to be bound to the
contact address specified in the Contact header for the duration indicated in
the Expires header.

##### [5.4.1.2A.1 Abnormal cases]{.underline} {#a.1-abnormal-cases .H6}
[In the case that the expiration timer from the UE is too short to be accepted

##### 5.4.1.4 User-initiated deregistration {#user-initiated-deregistration-1
.H6}
When S‑CCF receives a REGISTER request with the Expires header field
containing the value zero, the S‑CCF shall:
\- check whether [any of the following conditions apply. The S‑CCF shall only
proceed with the following steps if either one of the conditions is
met;]{.underline}
> [a) (case for using IMS-AKA authentication)]{.underline}the \"integrity-

~~The S‑CCF shall only proceed with the following steps if the \"integrity-
protected\" parameter is set to \"yes\";~~
\- release all dialogs that includes this user[\'s registered contact
address]{.underline}, where the dialogs were initiated by [or terminated
towards]{.underline} this [contact]{.underline} ~~UE~~ with the [registered
contact address for which the]{.underline} same public user identity found in
the To header field that was received in the REGISTER request or with one of
the implicitly registered public user identities by applying the steps listed
in subclause 5.4.5.1.2. However:
\- if the dialog that was established by the UE subscribing to the reg event
package used the public user identity that is going to be deregistered; and
\- this dialog is the only remaining dialog used for subscription to reg event
package;
then the S‑CCF shall not release this dialog;
\- if this public user identity was registered only by this UE, deregister the
public user identity found in the To header field together with the implicitly
registered public user identities. Otherwise, the S‑CCF will only remove the
contact address that was registered by this UE;
NOTE: If the UE sends a REGISTER request with the value \"*\" in the Contact
header and the value zero in the Expires header, the S‑CCF will only remove
the contact address that was registered by this UE identified with its private
user identity.
\- for all service profiles in the implicit registration set send a third-
party REGISTER request, as described in subclause 5.4.1.7, to each AS that
matches the Filter Criteria of the service profile from the HSS for the
REGISTER event; and
\- if this is a deregistration request for the only public user identity
currently registered with its associated set of implicitly registered public
user identities (i.e. no other is registered) and there are still active
multimedia sessions that includes this user[\'s registered contact
address]{.underline}, where the session was initiated [by or terminated
towards the contact]{.underline} with the [registered contact address for
that]{.underline} public user identity [which is]{.underline} currently
registered or with one of the implicitly registered public user identities,
release [only]{.underline} each of these multimedia sessions [associated with
the registered contact address]{.underline} by applying the steps listed in
subclause 5.4.5.1.2. Only dialogs associated to the multimedia sessions
originated or terminated towards the registered user[\'s contact
address]{.underline} shall be released.
If all public user identities of the UE are deregistered, then the S‑CCF may
consider the UE and P‑CSCF subscriptions to the reg event package cancelled
(i.e. as if the UE had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires header
containing a value of zero).
If the Authorization header of the REGISTER request ~~did not contain an
\"integrity-protected\" parameter, or~~[contained]{.underline} the
\"integrity-protected\" parameter ~~was~~ set to the value \"no\", the S‑CCF
shall apply the procedures described in subclause 5.4.1.2.1.
On completion of the above procedures in this subclause and of the Cx Server
Assignment procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], for
one or more public user identities, the S‑CCF shall update or remove those
public user identities, their registration state and the associated service
profiles from the local data (based on operators\' policy the S‑CCF can
request of the HSS to either be kept or cleared as the S‑CCF allocated to this
subscriber).
##### 5.4.1.5 Network-initiated deregistration {#network-initiated-
deregistration-2 .H6}
NOTE 1: A network-initiated deregistration event that occurs at the S-CSCF may
be received from the HSS or may be an internal event in the S-CSCF.
Prior to initiating the network-initiated deregistration for the only
currently registered public user identity and its associated set of implicitly
registered public user identities [and wildcarded public user
identities]{.underline} that have been registered with the same contact (i.e.
no other public user identity is registered with this contact) while there are
still active multimedia sessions belonging to this contact, the S-CSCF shall
release only the multimedia sessions belonging to this contact as described in
the following paragraph. The multimedia sessions for the same public user
identity, if registered with another contact remain unchanged.
Prior to initiating the network-initiated deregistration while there are still
active multimedia sessions that are associated with this user and contact, the
S-CSCF shall release none, some or all of these multimedia sessions by
applying the steps listed in subclause 5.4.5.1.2 under the following
conditions:
\- when the S-CSCF does not expect the UE to reregister (i.e. S-CSCF will set
the event attribute within the \ element to \"rejected\" for the
NOTIFY request, as described below), the S-CSCF shall release all sessions
that are associated with the [registered contact address for the]{.underline}
public user identities being deregistered, which includes the implicitly
registered public user identities.
\- when the S-CSCF expects the UE to reregister (i.e. S-CSCF will set the
event attribute within the \ element to \"deactivated\" for the
NOTIFY request, as described below), the S-CSCF shall only release sessions
that currently include the user[\'s contact address]{.underline}, where the
session was initiated [by or terminated towards the user]{.underline} with
[the contact address registered to]{.underline} one of the public user
identities being deregistered, which includes the implicitly registered public
user identities.
When a network-initiated deregistration event occurs for one or more public
user identities that are bound to one or more contacts, the S-CSCF shall send
a NOTIFY request to all subscribers that have subscribed to the respective reg
event package. For each NOTIFY request, the S-CSCF shall:
1) set the Request-URI and Route header to the saved route information during
subscription;
2) set the Event header to the \"reg\" value;
3) in the body of the NOTIFY request, include as many \ elements
as many public user identities the S-CSCF is aware of the user owns;
4) set the aor attribute within each \ element to one public
user identity:
a) set the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element of each
\ element to the contact address provided by the UE;
b) if the public user identity:
i) has been deregistered then:
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to
\"terminated\";
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to \"terminated\";
and
\- set the event attribute within the \ element to \"deactivated\" if
the S-CSCF expects the UE to reregister or \"rejected\" if the S-CSCF does not
expect the UE to reregister; or
ii) has been kept registered then:
I) set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\";
II) set the state attribute within the \ element to:
\- for the contact address to be removed set the state attribute within the
\ element to \"terminated\", and event attribute element to
\"deactivated\" if the S-CSCF expects the UE to reregister or \"rejected\" if
the S-CSCF does not expect the UE to reregister; or
\- for the contact address which remain unchanged, if any, leave the
\ element unmodified, and if the contact has been assigned GRUUs set
the \ and \ sub-elements of the \ element as
specified in draft-ietf-sipping-gruu-reg-event [94] and include the \ sub-element within each \ to any additional header parameters
contained in the Contact header of the REGISTER request according to RFC 3680
[43]; and
NOTE 2: There might be more than one contact information available for one
public user identity. When deregistering this UE, the S-CSCF will only modify
the \ elements that were originally registered by this UE using its
private user identity. The \ elements of the same public user
identitity, if registered by another UE using different private user
identities remain unchanged.
5) add a P-Charging-Vector header with the icid parameter populated as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17].
The S-CSCF shall only include the non-barred public user identities in the
NOTIFY request.
When sending a final NOTIFY request with all \ element(s) having
their state attribute set to \"terminated\" (i.e. all public user identities
have been deregistered or expired), the S-CSCF shall also terminate the
subscription to the registration event package by setting the Subscription-
State header to the value of \"terminated\".
Also, for all service profiles in the implicit registration set the S-CSCF
shall send a third-party REGISTER request, as described in subclause 5.4.1.7,
to each AS that matches the Filter Criteria of the service profile from the
HSS as if a equivalent REGISTER request had been received from the user
deregistering that public user identity, or combination of public user
identities.
In case of the deregistration of the old contact information when the UE is
roaming, registration is done in a new network and the previous registration
has not expired, on completion of the above procedures, the S-CSCF shall
remove the registration information related to the old contact from the local
data.
Otherwise, on completion of the above procedures for one or more public user
identities linked to the same private user identity, the S-CSCF shall
deregister those public user identities and the associated implicitly
registered public user identities. On completion of the Cx Server Assignment
procedure with the HSS, as described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], the S-CSCF shall
update or remove those public user identities linked to the same private user
identity, their registration state and the associated service profiles from
the local data (based on operators\' policy the S-CSCF can request of the HSS
to either be kept or cleared as the S-CSCF allocated to this subscriber). On
the completion of the Cx Registration-Termination procedure with the HSS, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], the S-CSCF shall remove those public user
identities, their registration state and the associated service profiles from
the local data.
##### 5.4.1.6 Network-initiated reauthentication {#network-initiated-
reauthentication .H6}
The S‑CCF may request a subscriber to reauthenticate at any time, based on a
number of possible operator settable triggers as described in subclause
5.4.1.2 [or subclause 5.4.1.2A]{.underline}.
If the S‑CCF is informed that a private user identity needs to be re-
authenticated, the S‑CCF shall generate a NOTIFY request on all dialogs which
have been established due to subscription to the reg event package of that
user. For each NOTIFY request the S‑CCF shall:
1) set the Request-URI and Route header to the saved route information during
subscription;
2) set the Event header to the \"reg\" value;
3) in the body of the NOTIFY request, include as many \ elements
as many public user identities the S‑CCF is aware of the user owns:
a) set the \ sub-element inside the \ sub-element of each
\ element to the contact address provided by the UE;
b) set the aor attribute within each \ element to one public
user identity;
c) set the state attribute within each \ element to \"active\";
d) set the state attribute within each \ element to \"active\";
e) set the event attribute within each \ element that was registered
by this UE to \"shortened\";
f) set the expiry attribute within each \ element that was registered
by this UE to an operator defined value; and
g) set the \ and \ sub-elements within each \
element as specified in subclause 5.4.2.1.2; and
NOTE 1: There might be more than one contact information available for one
public user identity. The S‑CCF will only modify the \ elements that
were originally registered by this UE using its private user identity. The
S‑CCF will not modify the \ elements for the same public user
identity, if registered by another UE using different private user identity.
4) set a P‑Charging-Vector header with the icid parameter populated as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17].
Afterwards the S‑CCF shall wait for the user to reauthenticate (see subclause
5.4.1.2 [and subclause 5.4.1.2A]{.underline}).
NOTE 2: Network initiated re-authentication may occur due to internal
processing within the S‑CCF.
The S‑CCF shall only include the non-barred public user identities in the
NOTIFY request.
When generating the NOTIFY request, the S‑CCF shall shorten the validity of
all registration lifetimes associated with this private user identity to an
operator defined value that will allow the user to be re-authenticated.
##### 5.4.1.7 Notification of Application Servers about registration status
{#notification-of-application-servers-about-registration-status .H6}
During registration, the S‑CCF shall include a P-Access-Network-Info header
and a P-Visited-Network-ID header (as received in the REGISTER request from
the UE) in the 3rd-party REGISTER sent towards the ASs, if the AS is part of
the trust domain. If the AS is not part of the trust domain, the S‑CCF shall
not include any P-Access-Network-Info header or P-Visited-Network-ID header.
The S‑CCF shall not include a P-Access-Network-Info header in any responses to
the REGISTER request.
If the registration procedure described in subclauses 5.4.1.2,
[5.4.1.2A,]{.underline} 5.4.1.4 or 5.4.1.5 (as appropriate) was successful,
the S‑CCF shall send a third-party REGISTER request to each AS with the
following information:
a) the Request-URI, which shall contain the AS\'s SIP URI;
b) the From header, which shall contain the S‑CCF\'s SIP URI;
c) the To header, which shall contain a non-barred public user identity
belonging to the service profile of the processed Filter Criteria. It may be
either a public user identity as contained in the REGISTER request received
from the UE or one of the implicitly registered public user identities, in the
service profile as configured by the operator;
NOTE 1: For the whole implicit registration set only one public user identity
per service profile appears in the third-party REGISTER requests. Thus, based
on third-party REGISTER requests only, the ASs will not have complete
information on the registration state of each public user identity in the
implicit registration set. The only way to have a complete and continuously
updated information (even upon administrative change in subscriber\'s profile)
is to subscribe to the reg event package.
d) the Contact header, which shall contain the S‑CCF\'s SIP URI;
e) for initial registration and user-initiated reregistration (subclause
5.4.1.2 [or subclause 5.4.1.2A]{.underline}), the Expires header, which shall
contain the same value that the S‑CCF returned in the 200 (OK) response for
the REGISTER request received from the UE;
f) for user-initiated deregistration (subclause 5.4.1.4) and network-initiated
deregistration (subclause 5.4.1.5), the Expires header, which shall contain
the value zero;
g) for initial registration and user-initiated reregistration (subclause
5.4.1.2 [or subclause 5.4.1.2A]{.underline}), a message body, if there is
Filter Criteria indicating the need to include HSS provided data for the
REGISTER event (e.g. HSS may provide AS specific data to be included in the
third-party REGISTER). If there is a service information XML element provided
in the HSS Filter Criteria for an AS (see 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]), then the S‑CCF
shall include it in the message body of the REGISTER request within the
\ XML element [which is a child XML element of an \
element with the \"version\" attribute set to \"1\"]{.underline} as described
in subclause 7.6. For the messages including the IM CN subsystem XML body, the
S‑CCF shall set the value of the Content-Type header to include the MIME type
specified in subclause 7.6;
h) for initial registration and user-initiated reregistration, the P‑Charging-
Vector header, shall contain the same icid parameter that the S‑CCF received
in the original REGISTER request from the UE. The S‑CCF shall insert a type 3
orig-ioi parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header. The type 3 orig-ioi
parameter identifies the sending network of the request and add a type 3 orig-
ioi parameter before the received orig-ioi parameter. The S‑CCF shall set the
type 3 orig-ioi parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of
the request. The S‑CCF shall not include the type 3 term-ioi parameter;
i) for initial registration and user-initiated reregistration, a P‑Charging-
Function-Addresses header, which shall contain the values received from the
HSS if the message is forwarded within the S‑CCF home network; and
j) in case the original received REGISTER request contained a P-User-Database
header and the AS belongs to the same operator as the S‑CCF, optionally a
P-User-Database header which shall contain the received value.
When the S‑CCF receives any response to a third-party REGISTER request, the
S‑CCF shall store the value of the term-ioi parameter received in the
P‑Charging-Vector header, if present.
NOTE 2: Any received term-ioi parameter will be a type 3 term-ioi. The type 3
term-ioi identifies the service provider from which the response was sent.
When the S‑CCF receives any response to third-party REGISTER, the S‑CCF shall
store the value of the type 3 term-ioi parameter received in the P‑Charging-
Vector header, if present. The type 3 term-ioi identifies the service provider
from which the response was sent.
If the S‑CCF fails to receive a SIP response or receives a 408 (Request
Timeout) response or a 5xx response to a third-party REGISTER, the S‑CCF
shall:
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_CONTINUED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] or no default
handling is indicated, no further action is needed; and
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_TERMINATED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], the S‑CCF shall,
for a currently registered public user identity, initiate the network-
initiated deregistration as described in subclause 5.4.1.5.
###### 5.4.1.8 Service profile updates
NOTE 1: The S-CSCF can receive an update of subscriber data notification on
the Cx interface, from the HSS, which can affect the stored information about
served public user identities. According to 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], the changes
are guaranteed not to affect the default public user identity within the
registration implicit set.
[When receiving a Push-Profile-Request (PPR) from the HSS (as described in
3GPP TS 29.228 [14]), modifying the service profile of served public user
identities, the S-CSCF shall]{.underline}
[1) if the modification consists in the addition of a new non-barred public
user identity to an implicit set, or in the change of status from barred to
non-barred for a public user identity already in the implicit set, add the
public user identity to the list of registered, non-barred public user
identities;]{.underline}
[2) if the modification consists in the deletion or in the change of status
from non-barred to barred of a public user identity in an implicit set, remove
the public user identity from the list of registered, non-barred public user
identities;]{.underline}
[NOTE 2: As the S-CSCF checks the barring status of the public user identity
on receipt of a initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, the
above procedures have no impact on transactions or dialogs already in progress
and are effective only for new transactions and dialogs.]{.underline}
[3) if the modification consists of deletion of a public user identity from an
implicit registration set while there are active multimedia session belonging
to this public user identity and contact, the S-CSCF shall perform the network
initiated deregistration procedures as described in sub-clause 5.4.1.5 and
skip synchronization of the UE and IM CN entitities as described in step 4;
and]{.underline}
[4) synchronize with the UE and IM CN entities, by either:]{.underline}
~~When receiving a Push-Profile-Request (PPR) from the HSS (as described in
3GPP TS 29.228 [14]), modifying the service profile of served public user
identities, the S-CSCF shall synchronize with the UE and IM CN entities, by
either:~~
\- performing the procedures for notification of the reg-event subscribers
about registration state, as described in subclause 5.4.2.1.2; or
\- triggering the UE to re-register, by shortening the life time of the
current registration, as described in subclause 5.4.1.6.
~~If the modification of the service profile consists in the addition of a new
non-barred public user identity to an implicit set, or in the change of status
from barred to non-barred for a public user identity already in the implicit
set, the S-CSCF shall add the public user identity to the list of registered,
non-barred public user identities.~~
~~If the modification of the service profile consists in the deletion or in
the change of status from non-barred to barred of a public user identity in an
implicit set, the S-CSCF shall remove the public user identity from the list
of registered, non-barred public user identities.~~
~~NOTE 2: As the S-CSCF checks the barring status of the public user identity
on receipt of a initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, the
above procedures have no impact on transactions or dialogs already in progress
and are effective only for new transactions and dialogs.~~
###### 5.4.2.1.2 Notification about registration state
When sending a NOTIFY request, the S-CSCF shall not use the default filtering
policy as specified in RFC 3680 [43], i.e. the S-CSCF shall always include in
every NOTIFY request the state information of all registered public user
identities of the user (i.e. the full state information).
NOTE 1: Contact information related to emergency registration is not included.
When generating NOTIFY requests, the S-CSCF shall not preclude any valid reg
event package parameters in accordance with RFC 3680 [43].
For each NOTIFY request on all dialogs which have been established due to
subscription to the reg event package of that user, the S-CSCF shall:
1) set the Request-URI and Route header to the saved route information during
subscription;
2) set the Event header to the \"reg\" value;
3) in the body of the NOTIFY request, include one \ elements for
each public user identity that the S-CSCF is aware the user owns.
If the user shares one or more public user identities with other users, any
contact addresses registered by other users of the shared public user identity
shall be included in the NOTIFY request;
4) for each \ element:
a) set the aor attribute to one public user identity;
b) set the \ sub-element inside each \ sub-element of the
\ element to the contact address provided by the respective UE
as follows:
I) if the aor attribute of the \ element contains a
[SIP]{.underline}~~sip or sips~~ URI, then for each contact address that
contains a +sip.instance header parameter, include \ and \ sub-elements within the corresponding \ element. The [S-CSCF
shall set the]{.underline} contents of these elements [as specified in draft-
ietf-sipping-gruu-reg-event [94]]{.underline}~~shall contain, respectively,
the public and temporary GRUUs representing (as specified in subclause 5.4.7A)
the association between the aor attribute of the \ element and
the instance ID contained in the +sip.instance parameter~~; or
II) if the aor attribute of the \ element contains a tel-URI,
determine its alias SIP URI and then include a copy of the \ and
\ sub-elements from that equivalent element; and
c) if the public user identityset at step a):
I) has been deregistered (i.e. no active contact left) then:
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to
\"terminated\";
\- set the state attribute within each \ element to \"terminated\";
and
\- set the event attribute within each \ element to \"deactivated\",
\"expired\", \"unregistered\", \"rejected\" or \"probation\" according to RFC
3680 [43].
If the public user identity has been deregistered and the deregistration has
already been indicated in the NOTIFY request, and no new registration has
occurred, its \ element shall not be included in the subsequent
NOTIFY requests; or
II) has been registered then:
\- set the \ element to any additional header parameters
contained in the contact header of the REGISTER request according to RFC 3680
[43];
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\",
if not already set to \"active\", otherwise leave it unchanged; and:
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\"; and
set the event attribute within the \ element to \"registered\"; or
III) has been re-registered then:
\- set the \ element to any additional header parameters
contained in the contact header of the REGISTER request according to RFC 3680
[43];
\- for contact addresses to be registered: set the state attribute within the
\ element to \"active\"; and set the event attribute within the
\ element to \"registered\"; or
\- for contact addresses to be re-registered, set the state attribute within
the \ element to \"active\"; and set the event attribute within the
\ element to \"refreshed\" according to RFC 3680 [43]; or
\- for contact addresses that remain unchanged, if any, leave the \
element unmodified; or
IV) has been automatically registered, and has not been previously
automatically registered:
\- set the \ element to any additional header parameters
contained in the contact header of the originsl REGISTER request according to
RFC 3680 [43];
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\";
\- set the state attribute within the \ element to \"active\"; and
\- set the event attribute within the \ element to \"created\";
~~and~~
[V) is hosted (unregistered case) at the S-CSCF:]{.underline}
[- set the state attribute within the \ element to
\"terminated\";]{.underline}
[- set the state attribute within each \ element to \"terminated\";
and]{.underline}
[- set the event attribute within each \ element to
\"unregistered\".]{.underline}
> [The S-CSCF shall also terminate the subscription to the registration event
> package by setting the Subscription-State header to the value of
> \"terminated\"; and]{.underline}
5) set the P-Charging-Vector header with the icid parameter populated as
specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [17] and a type 3 orig-ioi parameter. The S-CSCF
shall set the type 3 orig-ioi parameter to a value that identifies the sending
network of the request. The S-CSCF shall not include the type 3 term-ioi
parameter.
The S-CSCF shall only include the non-barred public user identities in the
NOTIFY request.
EXAMPLE: If sip:user1_public1\@home1.net is registered, the public user
identity sip:user1_public2\@home1.net can automatically be registered.
Therefore the entries in the body of the NOTIFY request look like:
\
\
\
\
\sip:[5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]\
\
\
\
\
\
\sip:[5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]\
\
\
\
\
When sending a final NOTIFY request with all \ element(s) having
their state attribute set to \"terminated\" (i.e. all public user identities
have been deregistered[,]{.underline} ~~or~~ expired [or are hosted
(unregistered case) at the S-CSCF]{.underline}), the S-CSCF shall also
terminate the subscription to the registration event package by setting the
Subscription-State header to the value of \"terminated\".
When all of a UE\'s contact addresses have been deregistered (i.e.there is no
\ element set to \"active\" for this UE), the S-CSCF shall consider
subscription to the reg event package belonging to the UE cancelled (i.e. as
if the UE had sent a SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires header containing a
value of zero).
The S-CSCF shall only include the non-barred public user identities in the
NOTIFY request.
When the S-CSCF receives any response to the NOTIFY request, the S-CSCF shall
store the value of the term-ioi parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector
header, if present.
NOTE 2: Any received term-ioi parameter will be a type 3 term-ioi. The type 3
term-ioi identifies the service provider from which the response was sent.
##### 5.4.3.2 Requests initiated by the served user {#requests-initiated-by-
the-served-user .H6}
When the S‑CCF receives from the served user or from a PSI an initial request
for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, and the request is
received either from a functional entity within the same trust domain or
contains a valid original dialog identifier (see step 3) or the dialog
identifier (From, To and Call-ID header fields) relates to an existing request
processed by the S‑CCF, then prior to forwarding the request, the S‑CCF shall:
1) determine whether the request contains a barred public user identity in the
P-Asserted-Identity header field of the request or not. In case the said
header field contains a barred public user identity for the user, then the
S‑CCF shall reject the request by generating a 403 (Forbidden) response.
Otherwise, continue with the rest of the steps;
NOTE 1: If the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains a barred public user
identity, then the message has been received, either directly or indirectly,
from a non-compliant entity which should have had generated the content with a
non-barred public user identity.
1A) if the Contact is a GRUU, but is not valid as defined in subclause
5.4.7A.4, then return a 4xx response as specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93];
2) store the value of the orig-ioi parameter received in the P‑Charging-Vector
header if present, and remove it from any forwarded request;
NOTE 2: Any received orig-ioi parameter will be a type 3 orig-ioi. The type 3
orig-ioi identifies the service provider from which the request was sent (AS
initiating a session on behalf of a user or a PSI);
3) check if an original dialog identifier that the S‑CCF previously placed in
a Route header is present in the topmost Route header of the incoming request.
If not present, the S‑CCF shall build an ordered list of initial filter
criteria based on the public user identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header
of the received request as described in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5]. If present, the
request has been sent from an AS in response to a previously sent request, an
ordered list of initial filter criteria already exists and it shall be kept
unchanged even if the AS has changed the P-Asserted-Identity header;
4) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header;
[4A) if there was an original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header of the incoming request and the request is received from a functional
entity within the same trust domain and contains a P-Asserted-Service header
field, continue the procedure with step 5;]{.underline}
~~4A) determine whether the contents of the request matches a subscribed
service (i.e. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type header field) for each and
any of the subscribed services for the served user. As an operator option, if
the contents of the request do not match a subscribed service, the S‑CCF may
reject the request by generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise,
continue with the rest of the steps;~~
~~Editor\'s note: It is for further study whether the S‑CCF shall authorise
and police that the media types used by the served user is consistent with the
ICSI value.~~
~~4B) determine whether the contents of the request matches a subscribed
service (i.e. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type header field) for each and
any of the subscribed services for the served user. As an operator option, if
the contents of the request do not match a subscribed service, the S-CSCF may
reject the request by generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise,
continue with the rest of the steps;~~
~~4C) if the request contains a P-Preferred-Service header field check whether
the ICSI value contained in the\ P-Preferred-Service header field is part of
the set of the subscribed services for the served user and if so then use that
ICSI value as the value for the P-Asserted-Header field for the request and
remove the P-Preferred-Service header field;~~
[4B) if the request contains a P-Preferred-Service header field, check whether
the ICSI value contained in the P-Preferred-Service header field is part of
the set of the subscribed services for the served user and determine whether
the contents of the request (e.g. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type header
field) match the ICSI for the subscribed service;]{.underline}
[a) if not, as an operator option, the S-CSCF may reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise remove the P-Preferred-
Service header field and continue with the rest of the steps;]{.underline}
[b) if so, and if the request is related to an IMS communication service and
the IMS communication service requires the use of an ICSI value then then
include a P-Asserted-Service header field in the request containing the ICSI
value contained in the P-Preferred-Service header field, remove the
P-Preferred-Service header field, and continue the procedure with step
5;]{.underline}
[c) if so, and if the request is related to an IMS communication service and
the IMS communication service does not require the use of an ICSI value then
continue without including an ICSI value; and]{.underline}
[d) if so, and if the request does not relate to an IMS communication service
(or if the S-CSCF is unable to unambiguously determine the service being
requested but decides to allow the session to continue) then continue without
inclding an ICSI value;]{.underline}
~~4D) if the request does not contain a P-Preferred-Service header field or
the ICSI value contained in a\ P-Preferred-Service header field is not part of
the set of the subscribed services for the served user then as an operator
option, the S‑CCF may reject the request by generating a 403 (Forbidden)
response. Otherwise, continue with the rest of the steps;~~
~~4E) if the the request does not contain a P-Preferred-Service header field
or the ICSI value contained in a P-Preferred-Service header field is not part
of the set of the subscribed services for the served user then if the contents
of the request are allowed by the subscribed services for the served user
select an ICSI value for the related IMS communication service;~~
[4C) if the request does not contain a P-Preferred-Service header field, check
whether the contents of the request match a subscribed service for each and
any of the subscribed services for the served user;]{.underline}
[a) if not, as an operator option, the S-CSCF may reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response; and]{.underline}
[b) if so, select an ICSI value for the related IMS communication service and
include a P-Asserted-Service header field in the request containing the
selected ICSI value;]{.underline}
~~4F) include a P-Asserted-Service header field in the request containing the
ICSI value determined in step 4B and use as a header field in the initial
request when matching initial filter criteria in step 5;~~
5) check whether the initial request matches the next unexecuted initial
filter criteria from the ordered list of initial filter criteria, and if it
does, the S‑CCF shall:
a) insert the AS URI to be contacted into the Route header as the topmost
entry followed by its own URI populated as specified in the subclause 5.4.3.4;
b) if the AS is located outside the trust domain then the S‑CCF shall remove
~~the P-Access-Network-Info header field and its values in the request and~~
the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header
from the request that is forwarded to the AS; if the AS is located within the
trust domain, then the S‑CCF shall retain ~~the P-Access-Network-Info header
field and its values and~~ the access-network-charging-info parameter in the
P‑Charging-Vector header in the request that is forwarded to the AS; and
c) insert a type 3 orig-ioi parameter before the received orig-ioi parameters
in the P‑Charging-Vector header. The S‑CCF shall set the type 3 orig-ioi
parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the request. The
S‑CCF shall not include the type 3 term-ioi parameter;
NOTE 3: Depending on the result of processing the filter criteria the S‑CCF
might contact one or more AS(s) before processing the outgoing Request URI.
NOTE 4: An AS can activate or deactivate its own filter criteria via the Sh
interface. As the S‑CCF checks initial filter criteria only on receipt of an
initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, a modified service
profile will have no impact on transactions or dialogs already in progress and
the modified profile will be effective only for new transactions and dialogs.
If the S‑CCF receives a modification of the iFC during their execution, then
it should not update the stored initial Filter Criteria until the iFC related
to the initial request have been completely executed.
6) if there is no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header of the incoming request store the value of the icid parameter received
in the P‑Charging-Vector header and retain the icid parameter in the
P‑Charging-Vector header. Optionally, the S‑CCF may generate a new, globally
unique icid and insert the new value in the icid parameter of the P‑Charging-
Vector header when forwarding the message. If the S‑CCF creates a new icid,
then it is responsible for maintaining the two icid values in the subsequent
messaging;
7) in step 5, if the initial request did not match the next unexecuted initial
filter criteria (i.e. the request is not forwarded to an AS), insert an orig-
ioi parameter into the P‑Charging-Vector header. The S‑CCF shall set the orig-
ioi parameter to a value that identifies the sending network. The S‑CCF shall
not include the type 2 term-ioi parameter;
8) if there is no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header of the incoming request insert a P‑Charging-Function-Addresses header
populated with values received from the HSS if the message is forwarded within
the S‑CCF home network, including towards AS;
9) if there is no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header of the incoming request and if the S‑CCF has knowledge that the SIP URI
contained in the received P-Asserted-Identity header is an alias SIP URI for a
tel URI, add a second P-Asserted-Identity header containing this tel-URI,
including the display name associated with the tel URI, if available. If the
P-Asserted-Identity header contains only a tel URI, the S‑CCF shall add a
second P-Asserted-Identity header containing a SIP URI. The added SIP URI
shall contain in the user part a \"+\" followed by the international public
telecommunication number contained in tel URI, and user\'s home domain name in
the hostport part. The added SIP URI shall contain the same value in the
display name as contained in the tel URI. The S‑CCF shall also add a user
parameter equals \"phone\" to the SIP URI;
NOTE 5: The S‑CSCF recognizes that a given SIP URI is an alias SIP URI of a
tel URI, since ~~they have the same service profile and belong to the same set
of implicitly registered public user identities~~[this grouping is sent from
the HSS (see 3GPP TS 29.228 [14])]{.underline}. If tel URI is shared URI so is
the alias SIP URI.
10) if the request is not forwarded to an AS and if the outgoing Request-URI
is:
\- a SIP URI with the user part starting with a + and the user parameter
equals \"phone\", and if configured per local operator policy, the S‑CCF shall
perform the procedure described here. Local policy can dictate whether this
procedure is performed for all domains of the SIP URI, only if the domain
belongs to the home network, or not at all. If local policy indicates that the
procedure is to be performed, then the S‑CCF shall translate the international
public telecommunications number contained in the user part of the SIP URI
(see RFC 3966 [22]) to a globally routeable SIP URI using either an ENUM/DNS
translation mechanism with the format specified in RFC 3761 [24], or any other
available database. Database aspects of ENUM are outside the scope of the
present document. An S‑CCF that implements the additional routeing
functionality described in annex I may forward the request without attempting
translation. If a translation is in fact performed and it succeeds, the S‑CCF
shall update the Request-URI with the globally routeable SIP URI returned by
ENUM/DNS. If this translation fails, the request may be forwarded to a BGCF or
any other appropriate entity (e.g. a MRFC to play an announcement) in the
originator\'s home network or the S‑CCF may send an appropriate SIP response
to the originator. When forwarding the request to a BGCF or any other
appropriate entity, the S‑CCF shall leave the original Request-URI containing
the SIP URI with user parameter equals phone unmodified. If the request is
forwarded, the S‑CCF shall remove the access-network-charging-info parameter
from the P‑Charging-Vector header prior to forwarding the message;
\- a tel URI in the international format, the S‑CCF shall translate the E.164
address (see RFC 3966 [22]) to a globally routeable SIP URI using either an
ENUM/DNS translation mechanism with the format specified in RFC 3761[ 24] , or
any other available database. Databases aspects of ENUM are outside the scope
of the present document. An S‑CCF that implements the additional routeing
functionality described in annex I may forward the request without attempting
translation. If this translation is in fact performed and it succeeds, the
S‑CCF shall update the Request-URI with the globally routeable SIP URI
returned by ENUM/DNS. If this translation fails, the request may be forwarded
to a BGCF or any other appropriate entity (e.g. a MRFC to play an
announcement) in the originator\'s home network or the S‑CCF may send an
appropriate SIP response to the originator. When forwarding the request to a
BGCF or any other appropriate entity, the S‑CCF shall leave the original
Request-URI containing the tel URI unmodified. If the request is forwarded,
the S‑CCF shall remove the access-network-charging-info parameter from the
P‑Charging-Vector header prior to forwarding the message;
\- a tel URI in non-international format (i.e. the local service number
analysis and handling is either failed in the appropriate AS or the request
has not been forwarded to AS for local service number analysis and handling at
all), either forward the request to a BGCF or any other appropriate entity
(e.g. a MRFC to play an announcement) in the originator\'s home network or
send an appropriate SIP response to the originator; and
\- a pres URI or an im URI, the S‑CCF shall forward the request as specified
in RFC 3861 [63]. In this case, the S‑CCF shall not modify the received
Request-URI;
11) determine the destination address (e.g. DNS access) using the URI placed
in the topmost Route header if present, otherwise based on the Request-URI. If
the destination requires interconnect functionalities (e.g. the destination
address is of an IP address type other than the IP address type used in the IM
CN subsystem), the S‑CCF shall forward the request the request shall be
forwarded to the destination address via an IBCF in the same network;
12) if network hiding is needed due to local policy, put the address of the
IBCF to the topmost route header;
13) in case of an initial request for a dialog:
a) determine the need for GRUU processing. GRUU processing is required if:
\- an original dialog identifier that the S‑CCF previously placed in a Route
header is not present in the topmost Route header of the incoming request
(this means the request is not returning after having been sent to an AS), and
\- the contact address contains a valid GRUU as specified in subclause
5.4.7A.4.
b) if GRUU processing is not required and the initial request originated from
a served user, then determine the need to record-route for other reasons:
\- if the request is routed to an AS which is part of the trust domain, the
S‑CCF can decide whether to record-route or not. The decision is configured in
the S‑CCF using any information in the received request that may otherwise be
used for the initial filter criteria. If the request is record-routed the
S‑CCF shall create a Record-Route header containing its own SIP URI; or
\- if the request is routed elsewhere, create a Record-Route header containing
its own SIP URI;
NOTE 6: For requests originated from a PSI the S‑CCF can decide whether to
record-route or not based on operator policy.
c) if GRUU processing is required, the S‑CCF shall create a Record-Route
header containing its own SIP URI;
d) if GRUU processing is required, the S‑CCF shall save an indication that
GRUU-routeing is to be performed for in-dialog requests that reach the S‑CCF
because of the Record-route header added in step c);
NOTE 7: The manner of representing the GRUU-routeing indication is a private
matter for the S‑CCF. The indication is used during termination processing of
in-dialog requests to cause the S‑CCF to replace a Request-URI containing a
GRUU with the corresponding registered contact address. It can be saved using
values in the Record-Route header, or in dialog state.
14) based on the destination user (Request-URI), remove the P-Access-Network-
Info header and the\ access-network-charging-info parameter in the P‑Charging-
Vector header prior to forwarding the message;
15) route the request based on SIP routeing procedures; and
16) if the request is an INVITE request, save the Contact, Cseq and Record-
Route header field values received in the request such that the S‑CCF is able
to release the session if needed.
When the S‑CCF receives, an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
standalone transaction, from an AS acting on behalf of an unregistered user,
the S‑CCF shall:
1) execute the procedures described in the steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 4A, 4B, 4C, ~~4D,
4E, 4F,~~ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 in the above paragraph
(when the S‑CCF receives, from a registered served user, an initial request
for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction).
NOTE 8: When the S‑CCF does not have the user profile, before executing the
actions as listed above, it initiates the S‑CCF Registration/deregistration
notification with the purpose of downloading the relevant user profile (i.e.
for unregistered user) and informs the HSS that the user is unregistered. The
S‑CCF will assess triggering of services for the unregistered user, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14].
If the S‑CCF fails to receive a SIP response or receives a 408 (Request
Timeout) response or a 5xx response from the AS, the S‑CCF shall:
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_CONTINUED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] or no default
handling is indicated, execute the procedure from step 4; and
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_TERMINATED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], either forward the
received response or, if the request is an initial INVITE request, send a 408
(Request Timeout) response or a 5xx response towards the served UE as
appropriate (without verifying the matching of filter criteria of lower
priority and without proceeding for further steps).
If the S‑CCF receives any final response from the AS, it shall forward the
response towards the served UE (without verifying the matching of filter
criteria of lower priority and without proceeding for further steps).
When the S‑CCF receives any response to the above request, the S‑CCF may:
1) apply any privacy required by RFC 3323 [33] and RFC 3325 [34] to the
P-Asserted-Identity header[, although the S‑CCF shall not, except for the case
where trust domain provisioning applies (e.g. response sent to an AS outside
the trusted domain) as described in clause 4.4, modify or remove the priv-
value set to "id" within the Privacy header]{.underline}.
NOTE 9: The P-Asserted-Identity header would normally only be expected in 1xx
or 2xx responses.
NOTE 10: The optional procedure above is in addition to any procedure for the
application of privacy at the edge of the trust domain specified by RFC 3325
[34].
[NOTE 10a: The priv-value "id" in the Privacy header will be used by the
originating UE to distinguish the request of TIR by the terminating user as
described in TS 183 008 [a].]{.underline}
When the S‑CCF receives any response to the above request containing a term-
ioi parameter, the S‑CCF shall store the value of the received term-ioi
parameter received in the P‑Charging-Vector header, if present, and remove all
received ioi parameters from the forwarded response if next hop is not an AS.
NOTE 11: Any received term-ioi parameter will be a type 2 term-ioi or type 3
term-ioi. The term-ioi parameter identifies the sending network of the
response message.
When the S‑CCF receives any response to the above request, and forwards it to
AS, the S‑CCF shall insert a P‑Charging-Vector header containing the orig-ioi
parameter, if received in the request, and a type 3 term-ioi parameter in the
response. The S‑CCF shall set the type 3 term-ioi parameter to a value that
identifies the sending network of the response and the type 3 orig-ioi
parameter is set to the previously received value of type 3 orig-ioi.
When the S‑CCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the initial request for a
dialog, if the response corresponds to an INVITE request, the S‑CCF shall save
the Contact and Record-Route header field values in the response in order to
be able to release the session if needed.
[When the S-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to an initial request for a
dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, if the response is forwarded
within the S-CSCF home network and not to an AS, the S-CSCF shall insert a
P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field populated with values received from
the HSS.]{.underline}
When the S‑CCF, upon sending an initial INVITE request that includes an IP
address in the SDP offer (in \"c=\" parameter), receives an error response
indicating that the IP address type is not supported, (e.g., the S‑CCF
receives the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) with 301 Warning header indicating
\"incompatible network address format\"), the S‑CCF shall either:
\- fork the initial INVITE request to the IBCF; or
\- process the error response and forward it using the Via header.
When the S‑CCF receives from the served user a target refresh request for a
dialog, prior to forwarding the request the S‑CCF shall:
[0A) if the dialog is related to an IMS communication service determine
whether the contents of the request (e.g. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type
header field) match the IMS communication service as received as the ICSI
value in the P-Asserted-Service header in the initial request. As an operator
option, if the contents of the request do not match the IMS communication
service the S-CSCF may reject the request by generating a status code
reflecting which added contents are not matching. Otherwise, continue with the
rest of the steps;]{.underline}
1) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header;
2) create a Record-Route header containing its own SIP URI;
3) or INVITE dialogs (i.e. dialogs initiated by an INVITE request), save the
Contact and Cseq header field values received in the request such that the
S‑CCF is able to release the session if needed;
4) in case the request is routed towards the destination user (Request-URI) or
in case the request is routed to an AS located outside the trust domain,
remove ~~the P-Access-Network-Info header and~~ the access-network-charging-
info parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header; and
5) route the request based on the topmost Route header.
When the S‑CCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the target refresh request
for an INVITE dialog, the S‑CCF shall replace the saved Contact and Record-
Route header field values in the response such that the S‑CCF is able to
release the session if needed.
When the S‑CCF receives from the served user a subsequent request other than a
target refresh request for a dialog, prior to forwarding the request the S‑CCF
shall:
1) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header;
2) in case the request is routed towards the destination user (Request-URI) or
in case the request is routed to an AS located outside the trust domain,
remove ~~the P-Access-Network-Info header and~~ the access-network-charging-
info parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header; and
3) route the request based on the topmost Route header.
With the exception of 305 (Use Proxy) responses, the S‑CCF shall not recurse
on 3xx responses.
##### 5.4.3.3 Requests terminated at the served user {#requests-terminated-at-
the-served-user .H6}
When the S‑CCF receives, destined for a statically pre-configured PSI or a
registered served user, an initial request for a dialog or a request for a
standalone transaction, prior to forwarding the request, the S‑CCF shall:
1) check if an original dialog identifier that the S‑CCF previously placed in
a Route header is present in the topmost Route header of the incoming request.
\- If present, the request has been sent from an AS in response to a
previously sent request.
\- If not present, it indicates that the request is visiting the S‑CCF for the
first time, and in this case the S‑CCF shall determine whether the request
contains a barred public user identity in the Request-URI of the request or
not. In case the Request URI contains a barred public user identity for the
user, then the S‑CCF shall reject the request by generating a 404 (Not Found)
response. Otherwise, continue with the rest of the steps;
2) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header;
3) if there was an original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header of the incoming request then check whether the Request-URI matches the
saved Request-URI. The Request-URI and saved Request-URI are considered a
match if the Request-URI is equal to the saved value of the Request-URI, or if
the\ Request-URI is a ~~public~~ GRUU [(public or temporary)]{.underline} and
the saved value of the Request-URI is a ~~temporary~~ GRUU [(public or
temporary)]{.underline} and both ~~the public and temporary~~ GRUUs represent
the same public user identity ~~and instance ID~~. If there is no match, then:
a) if the request is an INVITE request, save the Contact, CSeq and Record-
Route header field values received in the request such that the S‑CCF is able
to release the session if needed; and
b) forward the request based on the topmost Route header or if not available
forward the request based on the Request-URI (routing based on Request-URI is
specified steps 10 through 14 from subclause 5.4.3.2) and skip the following
steps.
3A) if the Request-URI is a GRUU, but is not valid as defined in subclause
5.4.7A.4, then return a 4xx response as specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93];
3B) if the Request-URI contains a public GRUU and the saved value of the
Request URI is a temporary GRUU, then replace the Request-URI with the saved
value of the Request-URI;
~~3C) if the request contains a P-Asserted-Service header field check whether
the IMS communication service identified by the ICSI value contained in the
P-Asserted-Service header field is allowed by the subscribed services for the
served user and if not, as an operator option, the S-CSCF may reject the
request by generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise remove the
P-Asserted-Service header field;~~
[3C) if the request contains a P-Asserted-Service header field check whether
the IMS communication service identified by the ICSI value contained in the
P-Asserted-Service header field is allowed by the subscribed services for the
served user;]{.underline}
[a) if so, continue from step 4; and]{.underline}
[b) if not, as an operator option, the S-CSCF may reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise, remove the P-Asserted-
Service header field and continue with the rest of the steps;]{.underline}
~~3D) if the request does not contain a P-Asserted-Service header field check
if the contents of the request matches a subscribed service (i.e. SDP media
capabilities, Content-Type header field) for each and any of the subscribed
services for the served user. As an operator option, if the contents of the
request do not match a subscribed service, the S‑CCF may reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise, continue with the rest of
the steps;~~
~~3E) if the request does not contain a P-Asserted-Service header field and if
the contents of the request (i.e. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type header
field) are allowed by the subscribed services for the served user include a
P-Asserted-Service header field in the request containing the ICSI value for
the related IMS communication service, and use the as a header field in the
initial request when matching initial filter criteria in step 4;~~
[3D) if the request does not contain a P-Asserted-Service header field check
if the contents of the request matches a subscribed service (e.g. SDP media
capabilities, Content-Type header field) for each and any of the subscribed
services for the served user;]{.underline}
[a) if not, as an operator option, the S-CSCF may reject the request by
generating a 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise, continue with the rest of
the steps;]{.underline}
[b) if so, and if the request is related to an IMS communication service and
the IMS communication service requires the use of an ICSI value then include a
P-Asserted-Service header field in the request containing the ICSI value for
the related IMS communication service, and use it as a header field in the
initial request when matching initial filter criteria in step 4;]{.underline}
[c) if so, and if the request is related to an IMS communication service and
the IMS communication service does not require the use of an ICSI value then
continue without including an ICSI value; and]{.underline}
[d) if so, and if the request does not relate to an IMS communication service
(or if the S-CSCF is unable to unambiguously determine the service being
requested but decides to allow the session to continue) then continue without
inclding an ICSI value;]{.underline}
4) check whether the initial request matches the next unexecuted initial
filter criteria based on the public user identity identified by the Request-
URI in the priority order and apply the filter criteria on the SIP method as
described in 3GPP TS 23.218 [5] subclause 6.5. If there is a match, then the
S‑CCF shall:
\- if the Request-URI is a temporary GRUU as defined in subclause 5.4.7A.3,
then replace the Request-URI with the public GRUU that is associated with the
temporary GRUU (i.e. the public GRUU representing the same public user
identity and instance ID as the temporary GRUU);
\- insert the AS URI to be contacted into the Route header as the topmost
entry followed by its own URI populated as specified in the subclause 5.4.3.4;
and
\- insert a type 3 orig-ioi parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header. The
type 3 orig-ioi parameter identifies the sending network of the request
message before the received orig-ioi. The S‑CCF shall not include the type 3
term-ioi parameter;
NOTE 1: Depending on the result of the previous process, the S‑CCF
[can]{.underline} ~~may~~ contact one or more AS(s) before processing the
outgoing Request-URI.
NOTE 2: If the Request-URI of the received terminating request contains a
temporary GRUU, then step 4 replaces the Request-URI with the associated
public GRUU before invoking the AS, and step 3B restores the original
temporary GRUU when the request is returned from the AS.
NOTE 3: An AS can activate or deactivate its own filter criteria via the Sh
interface. As the S‑CCF checks initial filter criteria only on receipt of an
initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, a modified service
profile will have no impact on transactions or dialogs already in progress and
the modified profile will be effective only for new transactions and dialogs.
If the S‑CCF receives a modification of the iFC during their execution, then
it should not update the stored initial Filter Criteria until the iFC related
to the initial request have been completely executed.
5) if there was no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header of the incoming request insert a P‑Charging-Function-Addresses header
field, if not present, populated with values received from the HSS if the
message is forwarded within the S‑CCF home network, including towards AS;
6) if there was no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header of the incoming request store the value of the icid parameter received
in the P‑Charging-Vector header and retain the icid parameter in the
P‑Charging-Vector header;
7) if there was no original dialog identifier present in the topmost Route
header of the incoming request store the value of the orig-ioi parameter
received in the P‑Charging-Vector header, if present, and remove all received
ioi parameters from the forwarded request if next hop is not an AS;
NOTE 4: Any received orig-ioi parameter will be a type 2 orig-ioi. or type 3
orig-ioi. The orig-ioi parameter identifies the sending network of the request
message.
8) in the case[:]{.underline}
[i)]{.underline} there are no Route header [field]{.underline}s in the
request[; and]{.underline}
[ii) there are bindings saved during registration or re-registration as
described in subclause 5.4.1.2 which are not marked as created by an emergency
registration as described in subclause 5.4.8.2;]{.underline}
[then]{.underline}, create a target set of potential routes from the list of
preloaded routes [associated with the bindings in item 8)
ii)]{.underline}~~saved during registration or re-registration, as described
in subclause 5.4.1.2~~, as follows:
a) if the Request-URI is a valid GRUU as defined in subclause 5.4.7A.4, then
the target set is determined by following the procedures for Request Targeting
specified in draft-ietf-sip-gruu [93], using the public user identity and
instance ID derived from the GRUU using the procedures of subclause 5.4.7A;
b) if the Request-URI is not a GRUU, then the target set is all the registered
contacts saved for the destination public user identity;
[NOTE 4A: In this release of the specification, use of preloaded routes saved
during registration or re-registration which created or refreshed bindings
marked as created by an emergency registration is out of scope.]{.underline}
9) if necessary perform the caller preferences to caller capabilities matching
according to RFC 3841 [56B] to the target set;
NOTE 5: This might eliminate entries and reorder the target set.
10) in case there are no Route headers in the request:
a) if there is more than one route in the target set determined in steps 8)
and 9) above:
\- if the fork directive in the Request Disposition header was set to \"no-
fork\", use the contact with the highest qvalue parameter when building the
Request-URI. In case no qvalue parameters were provided, the S‑CCF shall
decide locally what contact address to be used [to build the target
URI]{.underline}; otherwise
\- fork the request or perform sequential search based on the relative
preference indicated by the qvalue parameter of the Contact header in the
original REGISTER request, as described in RFC3261 [26]. In case no qvalue
parameters were provided, then the S‑CSCF determine the contact address to be
used [to build the target URI]{.underline} as directed by the Request
Disposition header as described in RFC 3841 [56B]. If the Request-Disposition
header is not present, the S‑CCF shall decide locally whether to fork or
perform sequential search among the contact addresses;
\- in case that no route is chosen, return a 480 (Temporarily unavailable)
response or another appropriate unsuccessful SIP response and terminate these
procedures.
b) [If no \"loose route\" indication has been received, in the service profile
of the served public user identity, from the HSS during registration
,]{.underline}build the Request-URI with the contents of the ~~Contact~~
[target]{.underline} URI determined in the previous step;
c) insert a P‑Called-Party-ID SIP header field containing the contents of the
Request-URI received in the request unless the Request-URI contains a
temporary GRUU in which case insert the public GRUU in the P‑Called-Party-ID;
d) build the Route header field with the Path values from the chosen route
[and if \"loose route\" indication has been received ,in the service profile
of the served user identity, from the HSS during registration, add the content
of the target URI determined in step a), as last URI of the
route]{.underline}; and
e) save the Request-URI and the total number of Record-route headers as part
of the dialog request state.
NOTE 6: For each initial dialog request terminated at a served user two pieces
of state are maintained to assist in processing GRUUs: the chosen contact
address to which the request is routed; and the position of an entry for the
S‑CCF in the Record-Route header that will be responsible for GRUU
translation, if needed (the position is the number of entries in the list
before the entry was added). The entry will be added in step 5) of the below
procedures for handling S‑CCF receipt any 1xx or 2xx response to the initial
request for a dialog. The S‑CCF can record-route multiple times, but only one
of those (the last) will be responsible for gruu translation at the
terminating end.
11) if the request is an INVITE request, save the Contact, CSeq and Record-
Route header field values received in the request such that the S‑CCF is able
to release the session if needed;
12) optionally, apply any privacy required by RFC 3323 [33] and RFC 3325 [34]
to the P-Asserted-Identity header and privacy required by RFC 4244 [66]
[although the S‑CCF shall not, except for the case where trust domain
provisioning applies (e.g. request sent to an AS outside the trusted domain)
as described in clause 4.4, modify or remove the priv-value set to "id" within
the Privacy header]{.underline};
NOTE 7: The optional procedure above is in addition to any procedure for the
application of privacy at the edge of the trust domain specified by RFC 3325
[34].
[NOTE 7a: The priv-value "id" in the Privacy header will be used by the
terminating UE to distinguish the request of OIR by the originating user as
described in TS 183 007 [b].]{.underline}
13) in case of an initial request for a dialog, either:
\- if the request is routed to an AS which is part of the trust domain, the
S‑CCF can decide whether to record-route or not. The decision is configured in
the S‑CCF using any information in the received request that may otherwise be
used for the initial filter criteria. If the request is record-routed the
S‑CCF shall create a Record-Route header containing its own SIP URI; or
\- if the request is routed elsewhere, create a Record-Route header containing
its own SIP URI;
13A) if the request is routed to the P‑CSCF remove the P-User-Database header
if present; and
14) forward the request based on the topmost Route header.
If the S‑CCF fails to receive a SIP response or receives a 408 (Request
Timeout) response or a 5xx response from the AS, the S‑CCF shall:
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_CONTINUED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14] or no default
handling is indicated, execute the procedure from step 4; and
\- if the default handling defined in the filter criteria indicates the value
\"SESSION_TERMINATED\" as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14], either forward the
received response or, if the request is an initial INVITE request, send a 408
(Request Timeout) response or a 5xx response towards the originating UE as
appropriate (without verifying the matching of filter criteria of lower
priority and without proceeding for further steps).
If the S‑CCF receives any final response from the AS, it shall forward the
response towards the originating UE (without verifying the matching of filter
criteria of lower priority and without proceeding for further steps).
When the S‑CCF receives any response to the above request and forwards it to
AS, the S‑CCF shall insert a P‑Charging-Vector header containing the orig-ioi
parameter, if received in the request, and a type 3 term-ioi parameter in the
response. The S‑CCF shall set the type 3 term-ioi parameter to a value that
identifies the sending network of the response and the orig-ioi parameter is
set to the previously received value of orig-ioi.
NOTE 8: Any received term-ioi parameter will be a type 3 term-ioi. The term-
ioi parameter identifies the service provider from which the response was
sent.
When the S‑CCF receives, destined for an unregistered user, an initial request
for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the S‑CCF shall:
1) Void.
2) execute the procedures described in 1, 2, 3, 3C, 3D, ~~3E, 4,~~ 5, 6, 7,
11, 13; 13A and 14 in the above paragraph (when the S‑CCF receives, destined
for the registered served user, an initial request for a dialog or a request
for a standalone transaction).
3) In case that no AS needs to be contacted, then S‑CCF shall return an
appropriate unsuccessful SIP response. This response may be a 480 (Temporarily
unavailable) and terminate these procedures.
NOTE 9: When the S‑CCF does not have the user profile, before executing the
actions as listed above, it initiates the S‑CCF Registration/deregistration
notification with the purpose of downloading the relevant user profile (i.e.
for unregistered user) and informs the HSS that the user is unregistered. The
S‑CCF will assess triggering of services for the unregistered user, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [14]. When requesting the user profile the S‑CCF
can include the information in the P-Private-Key header in S‑CCF
Registration/deregistration notification.
Prior to performing S‑CCF Registration/Deregistration procedure with the HSS,
the S‑CCF decides which HSS to query, possibly as a result of a query to the
Subscription Locator Functional (SLF) entity as specified in 3GPP TS 29.228
[14] or use the value as received in the P-User-Database header in the initial
request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction as defined in
RFC 4457 [82]. The HSS address received in the response to SLF query can be
used to address the HSS of the public user identity with further queries.
When the S‑CCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the initial request for a
dialog (whether the user is registered or not), it shall:
1) if the response corresponds to an INVITE request, save the Contact and
Record-Route header field values in the response such that the S‑CCF is able
to release the session if needed;
2) if the response is not forwarded to an AS (i.e. the response is related to
a request that was matched to the first executed initial filter criteria),
insert a type 2 term-ioi parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header of the
outgoing response. The type 2 term-ioi is set to a value that identifies the
sending network of the response and the orig-ioi parameter is set to the
previously received value of orig-ioi. Values of orig-ioi and term-ioi in the
received response are removed;
3) in the case where the S‑CCF has knowledge that the SIP URI contained in the
received P-Asserted-Identity header is an alias SIP URI for a tel URI the
S‑CCF shall add a second P-Asserted-Identity header containing this tel URI
including the display name associated with the tel URI, if available. If the
P-Asserted-Identity header contains only a tel URI, the S‑CCF shall add a
second P-Asserted-Identity header containing a SIP URI. The added SIP URI
shall contain in the user part a \"+\" followed by the international public
telecommunication number contained in tel URI, and user\'s home domain name in
the hostport part. The added SIP URI shall contain the same value in the
display name as contained in the tel URI. The S‑CCF shall also add a user
parameter equals \"phone\" to the SIP URI;
4) in case the response is sent towards the originating user, the S‑CCF may
[retain]{.underline} ~~remove~~ the P-Access-Network-Info header based on
local policy rules and the destination user (Request-URI); and
5) save an indication that GRUU routeing is to be performed for subsequent
requests sent within this same dialog if:
a) there is a record-route position saved as part of the initial dialog
request state; and
b) the contact address in the response is a valid GRUU as specified in
subclause 5.4.7A.4.
NOTE 10: There could be several responses returned for a single request, and
the decision to insert or modify the Record-Route needs to be applied to each.
But a response might also return to the S‑CCF multiple times as it is routed
back through AS. The S‑CCF will take this into account when carrying out step
5) to ensure that the information is stored only once.
When the S‑CCF receives a response to a request for a standalone transaction
(whether the user is registered or not), in the case where the S‑CCF has
knowledge that the SIP URI contained in the received P-Asserted-Identity
header is an alias SIP URI for a tel URI the S‑CCF shall add a second
P-Asserted-Identity header containing this tel URI, including the display name
associated with the tel URI, if available. If the P-Asserted-Identity header
contains only a tel URI, the S‑CCF shall add a second P-Asserted-Identity
header containing a SIP URI. The added SIP URI shall contain in the user part
a \"+\" followed by the international public telecommunication number
contained in tel URI, and user\'s home domain name in the hostport part. The
added SIP URI shall contain the same value in the display name as contained in
the tel URI. The S‑CCF shall also add a user parameter equals \"phone\" to the
SIP URI. In case the response is forwarded to an AS that is located within the
trust domain, the S‑CCF shall retain ~~the P-Access-Network-Info header and~~
the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header;
otherwise, the S‑CCF shall remove ~~the P-Access-Network-Info header and~~ the
access-network-charging-info parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header.
When the S‑CCF receives the 200 (OK) response for a standalone transaction
request, the S‑CCF shall:
1) insert a P‑Charging-Function-Addresses header populated with values
received from the HSS if the message is forwarded within the S‑CCF home
network, including towards an AS; and
2) if the response is not forwarded to an AS (i.e. the response is related to
a request that was matched to the first executed initial filter
criteria),insert a type 2 term-ioi parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header
of the outgoing response. The type 2 term-ioi is set to a value that
identifies the sending network of the response and the type 2 orig-ioi
parameter is set to the previously received value of orig-ioi.
NOTE 11: If the S‑CCF forked the request of a stand alone transaction to
multiple UEs and receives multiple 200 (OK) responses, the S‑CCF will select
and return only one 200 (OK) response. The criteria that the S‑CCF employs
when selecting the 200 (OK) response is based on the operator\'s policy (e.g.
return the first 200 (OK) response that was received).
When the S‑CCF receives, destined for a served user, a target refresh request
for a dialog, prior to forwarding the request, the S‑CCF shall:
[0A) if the dialog is related to an IMS communication service determine
whether the contents of the request (e.g. SDP media capabilities, Content-Type
header field) match the IMS communication service as received as the ICSI
value in the P-Asserted-Service header in the initial request. As an operator
option, if the contents of the request do not match the IMS communication
service the S-CSCF may reject the request by generating a status code
reflecting which added contents are not matching. Otherwise, continue with the
rest of the steps;]{.underline}
1) if the incoming request is received on a dialog for which GRUU routeing is
to be performed and the\ Request-URI is not the GRUU for this dialog, then
return a response of 400 (Bad Request).
2) if the incoming request is received on a dialog for which GRUU routeing is
to be performed and the\ Request-URI contains the GRUU for this dialog then
the S‑CCF shall:
\- perform the procedures for Request Targeting specified in draft-ietf-sip-
gruu [93], using the public user identity and instance ID derived from the
Request-URI, as specified in subclause 5.4.7A;
\- if no contact can be selected, return a response of 480 (Temporarily
Unavailable).
3) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header;
4) for INVITE dialogs (i.e. dialogs initiated by an INVITE request), save the
Contact and Cseq header field values received in the request such that the
S‑CCF is able to release the session if needed;
5) create a Record-Route header containing its own SIP URI; and
6) forward the request based on the topmost Route header.
When the S‑CCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response to the target refresh request
for a dialog (whether the user is registered or not), the S‑CCF shall:
1) for INVITE dialogs, replace the saved Contact header field values in the
response such that the S‑CCF is able to release the session if needed; ~~and~~
2) in case the response is forwarded to an AS that is located within the trust
domain, the S‑CCF shall retain ~~the\ P-Access-Network-Info header and~~ the
access-network-charging-info parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header;
otherwise, the S‑CCF shall remove ~~the P-Access-Network-Info header and~~ the
access-network-charging-info parameter in the P‑Charging-Vector header~~.~~[;
and]{.underline}
[3) if the response is forwarded within the S-CSCF home network and not to an
AS, insert a P-Charging-Function-Addresses header field populated with values
received from the HSS.]{.underline}
When the S‑CCF receives, destined for the served user, a subsequent request
other than target refresh request for a dialog, prior to forwarding the
request, the S‑CCF shall:
1) if the incoming request is received on a dialog for which GRUU routeing is
to be performed and the\ Request-URI is not the GRUU for this dialog, then
return a response of 400 (Bad Request).
2) if the incoming request is received on a dialog for which GRUU routeing is
to be performed and the\ Request-URI contains the GRUU for this dialog then
the S‑CCF shall:
\- perform the procedures for Request Targeting specified in draft-ietf-sip-
gruu [93], using the public user identity and instance ID derived from the
Request-URI, as specified in subclause 5.4.7A;
\- if no contact can be selected, return a response of 480 (Temporarily
Unavailable).
3) remove its own URI from the topmost Route header; and
4) forward the request based on the topmost Route header.
When the S‑CCF receives a response to a subsequent request other than target
refresh request for a dialog, in case the response is forwarded to an AS that
is located within the trust domain, the S‑CCF shall retain ~~the P-Access-
Network-Info header and~~ the access-network-charging-info parameter from the
P‑Charging-Vector header; otherwise, the S‑CCF shall remove the access-
network-charging-info parameter from the P‑Charging-Vector header.
With the exception of 305 (Use Proxy) responses, the S‑CCF shall not recurse
on 3xx responses.
##### 5.4.4.2.1 UE-originating case
~~When the S-CSCF receives any 1xx or 2xx response, the S-CSCF shall insert a
P-Charging-Function-Addresses header populated with values received from the
HSS if the message is forwarded within the S-CSCF home network, including
towards AS.~~
When the S-CSCF receives the request containing the access-network-charging-
info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector, the S-CSCF shall store the access-
network-charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header. The S-CSCF
shall retain access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header when the request is forwarded to an AS. However, the S-CSCF shall not
include the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header when the request is forwarded outside the home network of the S-CSCF.
When the S-CSCF receives any request or response (excluding ACK requests and
CANCEL requests and responses) related to a UE-originated dialog or standalone
transaction, the S-CSCF may insert previously saved values into P-Charging-
Vector and P-Charging-Function-Addresses headers before forwarding the message
within the S-CSCF home network, including towards AS.
##### 5.4.4.2.2 UE-terminating case
~~When the S-CSCF receives the any 1xx or 2xx response, the S-CSCF shall
insert a P-Charging-Function-Addresses header populated with values received
from the HSS if the message is forwarded within the S-CSCF home network,
including towards AS.~~
When the S-CSCF receives 180 (Ringing) or 200 (OK) (to INVITE) responses
containing the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-
Vector, the S-CSCF shall store the access-network-charging-info parameter from
the P-Charging-Vector header. The S-CSCF shall retain the access-network-
charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header when the response is
forwarded to an AS. However, the S-CSCF shall not include the access-network-
charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header when the response is
forwarded outside the home network of the S-CSCF.
When the S-CSCF receives any request or response (excluding ACK requests and
CANCEL requests and responses) related to a UE-terminated dialog or standalone
transaction, the S-CSCF may insert previously saved values into P-Charging-
Vector and P-Charging-Function-Addresses headers before forwarding the message
within the S-CSCF home network, including towards AS.
###### 5.4.5.1.2A Release of the existing dialogs due to registration
expiration
When the registration lifetime of the only public user identity currently
registered with its associated set of implicitly registered public user
identities (i.e. no other is registered) expires while there are still active
multimedia sessions that includes this user[\'s contact address]{.underline},
where the session was initiated [by or terminated towards the
user]{.underline} with the [contact address associated with the]{.underline}
public user identity currently registered or with one of the implicitly
registered public used identities, the S-CSCF shall release each of these
multimedia sessions by applying the steps listed in the subclause 5.4.5.1.2.
[Only dialogs associated to the multimedia sessions originated or terminated
towards the registered user\'s contact address shall be released.]{.underline}
###### 5.4.6.1.2 UE-originating case
For a reINVITE request or UPDATE request from the UE within the same dialog,
the S-CSCF shall store the updated access-network-charging-info parameter from
P-Charging-Vector header in the received SIP request. The S-CSCF shall retain
the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header
when the request is forwarded to an AS. However, the S-CSCF shall not include
the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header
when the request is forwarded outside the home network of the S-CSCF.
For a reINVITE request from the UE, if the request is to be forwarded to an AS
that is located within the trust domain, the S-CSCF shall retain ~~the
P-Access-Network-Info header and~~ the access-network-charging-info parameter
from the P-Charging-Vector header; otherwise, the S-CSCF shall remove ~~the
P-Access-Network-Info header and~~ the access-network-charging-info parameter
from the P-Charging-Vector header.
###### 5.4.6.1.3 UE-terminating case
For a reINVITE request or UPDATE request destined towards the UE within the
same dialog, when the S-CSCF receives the 200 (OK) response (to the INVITE
request or UPDATE request), the S-CSCF shall store the updated access-network-
charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header. The S-CSCF shall
retain the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header when the response is forwarded to the AS. However, the S-CSCF shall not
include the access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header when the 200 (OK) response is forwarded outside the home network of the
S-CSCF.
For any SIP response to an INVITE request, if the response is to be forwarded
to an AS that is located within the trust domain, the S-CSCF shall retain
~~the P-Access-Network-Info header and~~ the access-network-charging-info
parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header; otherwise, the S-CSCF shall
remove ~~the P-Access-Network-Info header and~~ the access-network-charging-
info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header.
###### 5.4.7A.2 Representation of public GRUUs
Each public GRUU shall conform to all requirements specified in draft-ietf-
sip-gruu [93].
The S-CSCF constructs a public GRUU by adding a \"gr\" URI parameter to [the
canonical form of the SIP URI which contains]{.underline} a public user
identity. The \"gr\" parameter serves as an indicator that the URI is in fact
a GRUU and carries a value that encodes the instance ID.
By default, the value of the \"gr\" parameter is a copy of the value of the
\"sip.instance\" header parameter from a Contact address registered with the
S-CSCF, with escaping of special characters as specified in RFC3261 [26]. A
different representation of the instance ID may be specified for specific
forms of instance ID.
~~Editor's Note: The specification of such additional specific representations
of the instance ID is FFS.~~
[NOTE: The specification of such additional specific representations of the
instance ID is outside the scope of this version of the
specification.]{.underline}
The public GRUU for a particular association of public user identity and
instance ID is persistent. The same public GRUU will be returned each time a
registration is performed with a particular pair of public user identity and
instance ID.
#### 5.4.8.1 General
S-CSCF shall handle the emergency registration as per the needs of the normal
registration.
For all registrations identified as relating to an emergency
[registration]{.underline}~~public user identity~~, the S-CSCF shall give
priority over other transactions or dialogs. This allows special treatment of
such registrations.
NOTE: This special treatment can include filtering, higher priority
processing, routeing, call gapping. The exact meaning of priority is not
defined further in this document, but is left to national regulation and
network configuration.
###### 5.4.8.2 Initial emergency registration or user-initiated emergency
reregistration
When the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request ~~without an \"integrity-
protected\" parameter, or~~ with the \"integrity-protected\" parameter in the
Authorization header set to \"no\" and the [Contact]{.underline}~~To~~ header
includes a~~n~~ [\"sos\" URI parameter that indicates that this is an
emergency registration,]{.underline}~~emergency public user identity~~ the
S-CSCF shall perform the actions as specified in subclause 5.4.1.2.1 with the
following additions:
\- if the ~~emergency~~[public]{.underline} user identity is linked to a
private user identity that has a registered emergency public user identity but
with a new contact address, and the authentication has been successful and if
the previous emergency registration has not expired, the S-CSCF shall delete
the previous contact information. Contacts related to non-emergency
registration shall not be deregistered.
When the S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request with the \"integrity-protected\"
parameter in the Authorization header set to \"yes\" [and the Contact header
includes a \"sos\" URI parameter that indicates that this is an emergency
registration]{.underline}, the S-CSCF shall identify the user by the
~~emergency~~ public user identity as received in the To header and the
private user identity as received in the Authorization header of the REGISTER
request the S-CSCF shall perform the actions as specified in subclause
5.4.1.2.2 with the following additions:
\- the S-CSCF shall not include a Service-Route in the 200 (OK)
[response]{.underline} to the REGISTER request;
\- the S-CSCF shall not include a temporary GRUU in the 200 (OK)
[response]{.underline} to the REGISTER request;
[- the S-CSCF shall include the \"sos\" URI parameter in the URI that was
successfully emergency registered and included in the Contact header field of
the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request;]{.underline}
[NOTE 1: In the case where the S-CSCF returns a GRUU in the Contact header
field of the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the \"sos\" URI
parameter is appended to the URI and not included as a Contact header field
parameter. The public GRUU that is returned in the 200 (OK) response includes
the \"sos\" URI parameter as a parameter of the URI included in the \"pub-
gruu\" Contact header field parameter.]{.underline}
\- store the Path header and the contact information including all header
parameters contained in the Contact header~~. The S-CSCF shall use the Path
header and the contact information obtained during the emergency registration
to build a preloaded Route header values for the emergency dialogs (e.g. PSAP
call back session) destined for the UE~~;
NOTE ~~1~~[2]{.underline}: The Path header and contact information used for
the emergency dialogs destined for the UE and obtained during the emergency
registration can be different than the Path header used for the non-emergency
communication and obtained during the non-emergency registration.
NOTE ~~2~~[3]{.underline}: If the previous emergency registration with
different contact information or emergency Path header has not expired, the
S-CSCF will not perform the network initiated deregistration procedure for the
previous emergency registration, but will let it expire.
\- the S-CSCF shall not send any third-party REGISTER requests to any AS;
~~and~~
\- determine the duration of the registration by checking the value of the
Expires header in the received REGISTER request and based on local policy[;
and]{.underline}~~.~~
NOTE ~~3~~[4]{.underline}: The value of the emergency registration time is
subject to national regulation and can be subject to roaming agreements.
[- for any bindings created by the emergency registration, mark those bindings
as created by an emergency registration.]{.underline}
###### 5.4.8.3 User-initiated emergency deregistration
When S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request with the Expires header field
containing the value zero and the [Contact header contains a contact address
that has been registered for emergency service (i.e. the \"sos\" URI parameter
that indicates that this is an emergency registration is included in the
Contact header field)]{.underline}~~To header includes an emergency public
user identity as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3]~~, the S-CSCF shall reject
the REGISTER request by sending a 501 (Not Implemented) response.
NOTE: The UE cannot deregister its emergency public user identity.
###### 5.4.8.4 Network-initiated emergency deregistration
The S-CSCF shall not perform a network-initiated emergency deregistration
~~for an emergency public user identity~~.
###### 5.4.8.5 Network-initiated emergency reauthentication
[If a given public user identity and the associated contact address have been
registered via emergency registration, t]{.underline}~~T~~he S-CSCF shall not
reauthenticate [this]{.underline}~~an emergency~~ public user identity.
###### 5.4.8.6 Subscription to the event providing registration state
If a S-CSCF receives a SUBSCRIBE request addressed to S-CSCF containing the
Event header with the reg event package with [the Contact header that contains
a contact address that has been registered for emergency service]{.underline}
~~a emergency public user identity in the To header~~, the S-CSCF shall reject
the SUBSCRIBE request for the reg-event package by sending a 489 (Bad Event)
response.
###### 5.4.8.7 Notification of the registration state
~~The S-CSCF shall not send a NOTIFY request addressed to an emergency public
user identity regarding its subscription state.~~
When the user performs an emergency registration or when the emergency
registration expires, the S-CSCF shall not send a NOTIFY request to the
subscribers to the reg event package of the respective user.
The [contact address that has been registered for emergency
service]{.underline}~~emergency public user identities~~ shall not be included
in the NOTIFY requests sent to the subscribers to the reg event package of the
user.
### 5.5.1 General
The MGCF, although acting as a UA, does not initiate any registration of its
associated addresses. These are assumed to be known by peer-to-peer
arrangements within the IM CN subsystem. Therefore table A.4/1 and
dependencies on that major capability shall not apply.
The use of the Path and Service-Route headers shall not be supported by the
MGCF.
When the MGCF sends any request or response related to a dialog, the MGCF may
insert previously saved values into P-Charging-Vector and P-Charging-Function-
Addresses headers before sending the message.
The MGCF shall use a GRUU referring to itself (as specified in draft-ietf-sip-
gruu [93]) when inserting a contact address in a dialog establishing or target
refreshing SIP message. This specification does not define how GRUUs are
created by the MGCF; they can be provisioned by the operator or obtained by
any other mechanism. A GRUU used by the MGCF when establishing a dialog shall
remain valid for the lifetime of the dialog. [The GRUU used by the MGCF shall
not reveal calling party related information.]{.underline}
The MGCF shall handle requests addressed to its currently valid GRUUs when
received outside of the dialog in which the GRUU was provided.
EXAMPLE: Upon receipt of an INVITE request addressed to a GRUU assigned to a
dialog it has active, and containing a Replaces header referencing that
dialog, the MGCF will be able to establish the new call replacing the old one.
##### 5.5.3.1.1 Calls originated from circuit-switched networks
When the MGCF receives an indication of an incoming call from a circuit-
switched network, the MGCF shall:
1) generate an INVITE request:
\- set the Request-URI to the \"tel\" format using an E.164 address or to the
\"sip\" format using an E164 address in the user portion and set user=phone;
NOTE 1: Details how to set the host portion are out of scope of the document.
However, when a SIP URI is used the host portion needs to be part of the
domain name space owned by the I-CSCF
\- include the \"100rel\" option tag in the Supported header field (as defined
in RFC 3262 [27]);
\- include the \"preconditions\" option tag in the Supported header field (as
defined in RFC 3312 [30] as updated by RFC 4032 [64]) if the MGCF supports the
SIP preconditions mechanism;
[- not indicate the requirement for the precondition mechanism by using the
Require header field;]{.underline}
\- include an P-Asserted-Identity header, including the display name if
available, depending on corresponding information in the circuit-switched
network;
\- create a new, globally unique value for the icid parameter and insert it
into the P-Charging-Vector header; and
\- insert a type 2 orig-ioi parameter into the P-Charging-Vector header. The
MGCF shall set the type 2 orig-ioi parameter to a value that identifies the
sending network in which the MGCF resides and the type 2 term-ioi parameter
shall not be included.
  1. When the MGCF receives a 1xx or 2xx response to an initial request for a dialog, the MGCF shall store the value of the received term-ioi parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector header, if present.
NOTE 2: Any received term-ioi parameter will be a type 2 term-ioi. The type 2
term-ioi parameter identifies the sending network of the response message.
###### 5.7.1.9 Use of ICSI and IARI values
It shall be possible for an AS based upon the service logic to validate an
ICSI value received in an Accept-Contact header or received in a P-Asserted-
Service header and reject the request if necessary.
A trusted AS may insert a P-Asserted-Service header field in a request for a
new dialog or standalone transaction. An untrusted AS may insert a
P-Preferred-Service header field in a request for a new dialog or standalone
transaction. If the request is related to an IMS communication service that
requires the use of an ICSI then the AS:
\- shall include the ICSI value (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2),
for the IMS communication service that is related to the request in either a
P-Asserted-Service header field or a P-Preferred-Service header field
depending whether the AS is trusted or not according to draft-drage-sipping-
service-identification [121].
When an AS that is acting as a UA or initiating B2BUA or routeing B2BUA sends
an initial request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, the
AS may include an Accept-Contact header field containing[:]{.underline}
[-]{.underline} an ICSI value (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) [in a
g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3841
[56B];]{.underline} and
\- ~~zero~~[one]{.underline} or more IARI values (coded as specified in
subclause 7.2A.9.2) that are related to the request in a
g.ims.~~app~~[iari]{.underline}-ref feature tag as defined in subcluase
7.9.~~2~~[3]{.underline} and RFC 3841 [56B]
if the ICSI or IARIs for the IMS communication service [and IMS
application]{.underline} are known.
The AS may:
\- include the received ICSI and IARI values;
\- replace or remove received ICSI and IARI values; or
\- include new ICSI and IARI values.
When the AS acting as a UA or initiating B2BUA or routeing B2BUA sends a SIP
request or a SIP response related to an IMS communication service, the AS may
include in the Contact header field
[- in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag as defined in subclause
7.9.2]{.underline}~~in a g.ims.app-ref feature tag zero~~ one or more ICSI
values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2); and
[-]{.underline} ~~zero~~one or more IARI values (coded as specified in
subclause 7.2A.9.2) [in a g.3gpp.iari-ref feature tag]{.underline}, for the
IMS [applications]{.underline} ~~communication service~~, that are related to
the request as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62].
[if the ICSI or IARIs for the IMS communication service and IMS application
are known.]{.underline} The AS may:
\- include the received ICSI and IARI values;
\- replace or remove received ICSI and IARI values; or
\- include new ICSI and IARI values.
#### 5.10.2.1 Registration
When IBCF receives a REGISTER request, the IBCF shall:
1) [void]{.underline}~~if network topology hiding is required, then apply the
encryption procedures for the Path header as described in subclause
5.10.4.1~~;
2) if network topology hiding is required or IBCF is configured to perform
application level gateway and/or transport plane control functionalities, then
the IBCF shall add its own routeable SIP URI to the top of the Path header;
and
NOTE 1: The IBCF can include in the inserted SIP URI an indicator that
identifies the direction of subsequent requests received by the IBCF i.e.,
from the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF, to identify the UE-terminating case. The
IBCF can encode this indicator in different ways, such as, e.g., a unique
parameter in the URI, a character string in the username part of the URI, or a
dedicated port number in the URI.
NOTE 2: Any subsequent request that includes the direction indicator (in the
Route header) or arrives at the dedicated port number, indicates that the
request was sent by the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF.
~~NOTE 3: In accordance with the procedures described in RFC 3608 [38], an
IBCF does not insert its own routeable SIP URI to the Service-Route header.~~
3) select an entry point of the home network and forward the request to that
entry point.
> If the selected entry point:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
IBCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;
> the IBCF shall select a new entry point and forward the original REGISTER
> request.
NOTE [3]{.underline}~~4~~: The list of the entry points can be either obtained
as specified in RFC 3263 [27A] or provisioned in the IBCF. The entry point can
be an IBCF or an I-CSCF.
> If the IBCF fails to forward the REGISTER request to any entry point, the
> IBCF shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response to the P-CSCF, in
> accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26].
###### 5.10.2.2 Initial requests
Upon receipt of
[-]{.underline} an [initial]{.underline}~~y~~ request [for a
dialog;]{.underline}
-~~,~~ [a request for a standalone transaction]{.underline} except the REGISTER method[; or]{.underline}
[- a request for an unknown method that does not relate to an existing
dialog;]{.underline}
~~,~~ the IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
2) if the request is an INVITE request and the IBCF is configured to perform
application level gateway and/or transport plane control functionalities, save
the Contact, CSeq and Record-Route header field values received in the request
such that the IBCF is able to release the session if needed;
[2A) if the request is an initial request for a dialog and local policy
requires the application of IBCF capabilities in subsequent requests, perform
record route procedures as specified in RFC 3261 [26];]{.underline}
3) if network topology hiding is required, apply the procedures as described
in subclause 5.10.4;
4) if screening of SIP signalling is required, apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.6;
5) ~~if IBCF processes a request without a pre-defined route (e.g. the
subscription to reg event package originated by the P-CSCF), select an entry
point of the home network and forward the request to that entry
point~~[void]{.underline};
~~NOTE 1: The list of the entry points can be either obtained as specified in
RFC 3263 [27A] or provisioned in the IBCF. The entry point can be an IBCF or
an I-CSCF.~~
6) store the values from the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header, if present;
~~and~~
7) remove [some of the parameters from]{.underline} the P-Charging-Vector
[header or the header itself, depending on operator policy, if
present;]{.underline} and
[8) remove]{.underline} the P-Charging-Function-Addresses headers, if present,
prior to forwarding the message
[and forwards the request according to RFC 3261 [26].]{.underline}
[NOTE 1: If IBCF processes a request without a pre-defined route (e.g. the
subscription to reg event package originated by the P-CSCF), the next-hop
address can be either obtained as specified in RFC 3263 [27A] or be
provisioned in the IBCF.]{.underline}
When the IBCF receives an INVITE request, the IBCF may require the periodic
refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the IBCF. If the IBCF
requires the session to be refreshed, it shall apply the procedures described
in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 2: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
one of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at
least one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
When the IBCF receives a response to the initial request and network topology
hiding is required, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as described in
subclause 5.10.4.
When the IBCF receives a response to the initial request and screening of SIP
signalling is applied, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as described
in subclause 5.10.6.
###### 5.10.2.3 Subsequent requests
Upon receipt of a~~ny~~ [subsequent]{.underline} request~~, except the
REGISTER method~~, the IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
2) if the request is a target refresh request and the IBCF is configured to
perform application level gateway and/or transport plane control
functionalities, save the Contact and CSeq header field values received in the
request such that the IBCF is able to release the session if needed;
3) if the subsequent request is other than a target refresh request (including
requests relating to an existing dialog where the method is unknown) and the
IBCF is configured to perform application level gateway and/or transport plane
control functionalities, save the Contact and CSeq header field values
received in the request such that the IBCF is able to release the session if
needed;
4) if network topology hiding is required, apply the procedures as described
in subclause 5.10.4; and
5) if screening of SIP signalling is required, apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.6~~.~~
[and forwards the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].]{.underline}
When the IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and network
topology hiding is required, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.4.
When the IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and screening of
SIP signalling is required, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.6.
#### 5.10.3.1 Registration
When IBCF receives a REGISTER request, the IBCF shall:
1) verify if it arrived from a trusted domain or not. If the request arrived
from an untrusted domain, respond with 403 (Forbidden) response;
NOTE 1: The IBCF can find out whether the request arrived from a trusted
domain or not, from the procedures described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [19A].
2) if network topology hiding, or screening of SIP signalling, is required or
IBCF is configured to perform application level gateway and/or transport plane
control functionalities, add its own routeable SIP URI to the top of the Path
header; and
NOTE 2: The IBCF can include in the inserted SIP URI an indicator that
identifies the direction of subsequent requests received by the IBCF i.e.,
from the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF, to identify the UE-terminating case. The
IBCF can encode this indicator in different ways, such as, e.g., a unique
parameter in the URI, a character string in the username part of the URI, or a
dedicated port number in the URI.
NOTE 3: Any subsequent request that includes the direction indicator (in the
Route header) or arrives at the dedicated port number, indicates that the
request was sent by the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF.
~~NOTE 4: In accordance with the procedures described in RFC 3608 [38], an
IBCF does not insert its own routable SIP URI to the Service-Route header.~~
3) If IBCF is colocated with an I-CSCF, or it has a preconfigured I-CSCF to be
contacted, forward the request to that I-CSCF. Otherwise select an I-CSCF and
forward the request to that I-CSCF.
NOTE [4]{.underline}~~5~~: The selection of an I-CSCF can lead to additional
delays.
If the selected I-CSCF:
\- does not respond to the REGISTER request and its retransmissions by the
IBCF; or
\- sends back a 3xx response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to a
REGISTER request;
the IBCF shall select a new I-CSCF and forward the original REGISTER request.
NOTE 5: The list of the I-CSCFs can be either obtained as specified in RFC
3263 [27A] or provisioned in the IBCF.
If the IBCF fails to forward the REGISTER request to any I-CSCF, the IBCF
shall send back a 504 (Server Time-Out) response towards the P-CSCF, in
accordance with the procedures in RFC 3261 [26].
###### 5.10.3.2 Initial requests
Upon receipt of
[-]{.underline} an~~y~~ [initial]{.underline} request [for a
dialog]{.underline};~~,~~
[- a request for a standalone transaction]{.underline} except the REGISTER
request[; or]{.underline}~~,~~
[- a request for an unknown method that does not relate to an existing
dialog,]{.underline}
the IBCF shall verify whether the request is arrived from a trusted domain or
not. If the request arrived from an untrusted domain, then the IBCF shall;
\- if the topmost Route header of the request contains the \"orig\" parameter,
respond with 403 (Forbidden) response. Otherwise,
\- remove ~~all P-Asserted-Identity headers, all P-Access-Network-Info
headers,~~ all P-Charging-Vector headers and all P-Charging-Function-Addresses
headers the request may contain.
Upon receipt of
[-]{.underline} an~~y~~ [initial]{.underline} request [for a
dialog;]{.underline}~~,~~
[- a request for a standalone transaction]{.underline} except the REGISTER
request[;]{.underline}~~,~~ [or]{.underline}
[- a request for an unknown method that does not relate to an existing
dialog;]{.underline}
the IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, then respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
2) if the request is an INVITE request and the IBCF is configured to perform
application level gateway and/or transport plane control functionalities, then
the IBCF shall save the Contact, CSeq and Record-Route header field values
received in the request such that the IBCF is able to release the session if
needed;
[2A) if the request is an initial request for a dialog and local policy
requires the application of IBCF capabilities in subsequent requests, perform
record route procedures as specified in the RFC 3261 [26];]{.underline}
3) if network topology hiding is required, then apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.4; and
4) If IBCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone transaction,
that contains a single Route header pointing to itself, and it is co-located
with an I-CSCF, or it has a preconfigured I-CSCF to be contacted, then forward
the request to that I-CSCF. Otherwise select an I-CSCF and forward the request
to that I-CSCF. If the single Route header of the request contains the
\"orig\" parameter, the IBCF shall insert the \"orig\" parameter to the URI of
the I-CSCF.
NOTE 1: The selection of an I-CSCF can lead to additional delays.
When the IBCF receives an INVITE request, the IBCF may require the periodic
refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the IBCF. If the IBCF
requires the session to be refreshed, it shall apply the procedures described
in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least one
of the UEs. This functionality cannot automatically be granted, i.e. at least
one of the involved UEs needs to support it.
When the IBCF receives a response to an initial request (e.g. 183 or 2xx), the
IBCF shall:
1) store the values from the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header, if present;
2) remove the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header prior to forwarding the
message; and
3) if network topology hiding is required, then the IBCF shall apply the
procedures as described in subclause 5.10.4.
###### 5.10.3.3 Subsequent requests
Upon receipt of a~~ny~~ [subsequent]{.underline} request~~, except the
REGISTER method~~, the IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, then respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
2) if the request is a target refresh request and the IBCF is configured to
perform application level gateway and/or transport plane control
functionalities, then the IBCF shall save the Contact and CSeq header field
values received in the request such that the IBCF is able to release the
session if needed;
3) if the subsequent request is other than a target refresh request (including
requests relating to an existing dialog where the method is unknown) and the
IBCF is configured to perform application level gateway and/or transport plane
control functionalities, then the IBCF shall save the Contact and CSeq header
field values received in the request such that the IBCF is able to release the
session if needed; and
4) if network topology hiding is required, then apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.4~~.~~
[and forwards the request, based on the topmost Route header field, in
accordance with the procedures of RFC 3261 [26].]{.underline}
When the IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and network
topology hiding is required, then the IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in subclause 5.10.4.
#### 5.10.4.1 General
NOTE 1: THIG functionality is performed in I-CSCF in Release-5 and Release-6
and is compatible with the procedures specified in this subclause.
The following procedures shall only be applied if network topology hiding is
required by the network. The network requiring network topology hiding is
called the hiding network.
NOTE 2: Requests and responses are handled independently therefore no state
information is needed for that purpose within an IBCF.
The IBCF shall apply network topology hiding to all headers which reveal
topology information, such as Via, Route~~,~~ [and]{.underline} Record-
Route~~, Service-Route, and Path~~.
[NOTE 3: If the P-CSCF is located in the visited network and in order to allow
the subscription initiated by the P-CSCF to the user\'s registration-state
event package, the IBCF cannot apply network topology hiding on the Path
header field contained in the REGISTER request.]{.underline}
[NOTE 4: In order to allow the roaming UE to perform restoration procedures
when the S-CSCF rejects the served user initiated request, the IBCF cannot
apply network topology hiding on the Service-Route header field contained in a
200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request.]{.underline}
Upon receiving an incoming REGISTER request for which network topology hiding
has to be applied and which includes a Path header, the IBCF shall add the
routeable SIP URI of the IBCF to the top of the Path header. The IBCF may
include in the inserted SIP URI an indicator that identifies the direction of
subsequent requests received by the IBCF i.e., from the S-CSCF towards the
P-CSCF, to identify the UE-terminating case. The IBCF may encode this
indicator in different ways, such as, e.g., a unique parameter in the URI, a
character string in the username part of the URI, or a dedicated port number
in the URI.
NOTE [5]{.underline}~~3~~: Any subsequent request that includes the direction
indicator (in the Route header) or arrives at the dedicated port number,
indicates that the request was sent by the S-CSCF towards the P-CSCF.
Upon receiving an incoming initial request for which network topology hiding
has to be applied and which includes a Record-Route header, the IBCF shall add
its own routeable SIP URI to the top of the Record-Route header.
#### 5.10.4.2 Encryption for network topology hiding
Upon receiving an outgoing request/response from the hiding network the IBCF
shall perform the encryption for network topology hiding purposes, i.e. the
IBCF shall:
1) use the whole header values which were added by one or more specific entity
of the hiding network as input to encryption, besides the UE entry;
2) not change the order of the headers subject to encryption when performing
encryption;
3) use for one encrypted string all received consecutive header entries
subject to encryption, regardless if they appear in separate consecutive
headers or if they are consecutive entries in a comma separated list in one
header;
4) construct a hostname that is the encrypted string;
5) append a \"tokenized-by\" parameter and set it to the value of the
encrypting network\'s name, after the constructed hostname;
6) form one valid entry for the specific header out of the resulting NAI, e.g.
prepend \"SIP/2.0/UDP\" for Via headers or \"sip:\" for ~~Path, Service-
Route,~~ Route and Record-Route headers;
7) if the IBCF encrypted an entry in the Route header, then it also inserts
its own URI before the topmost encrypted entry; and
8) if the IBCF encrypted an entry in the Via header, then it also inserts its
own URI before the topmost encrypted entry.
NOTE 1: Even if consecutive entries of the same network in a specific header
are encrypted, they will result in only one encrypted header entry. For
example:
> Via: SIP/2.0/UDP ibcf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> SIP/2.0/UDP Token( SIP/2.0/UDP scscf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> SIP/2.0/UDP pcscf1.home1.net;lr);
>
> tokenized-by=home1.net,
>
> SIP/2.0/UDP [5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]
NOTE 2: If multiple entries of the same network are within the same type of
headers, but they are not consecutive, then these entries will be tokenized to
different strings. For example:
> Record-Route: sip:ibcf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> sip:Token(sip:scscf1.home1.net;lr);tokenized-by=home1.net,
>
> sip:as1.foreign.net;lr,
>
> sip:Token(sip:scscf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> sip:pcscf1.home1.net;lr);tokenized-by=home1.net
NOTE 3: If request will return to the hiding network (e.g. after visiting an
AS), then the URI of IBCF is inserted. For example:
> Route: sip:as1.foreign.net;lr,
>
> sip:ibcf1.home1.net;lr,
>
> sip:Token(sip:scscf1.home1.net;lr);tokenized-by=home1.net
### 5.10.5 IMS-ALG functionality in the IBCF
The IBCF shall only apply the following procedures if application level
gateway functionality is required by the network.
The IBCF acts as a B2BUA when it performs IMS-ALG functionality. As an IMS-
ALG, the IBCF will internally map the message headers between the two dialogs
that it manages. It is responsible for correlating the dialog identifiers and
will decide when to simply translate a message from one dialog to the other,
or when to perform other functions. The IBCF, although acting as a UA, does
not initiate any registration of its associated addresses. These are assumed
to be known by peer-to-peer arrangements within the IM CN subsystem.
When the IBCF receives an initial INVITE request from another SIP network,
i.e. the IBCF acts as an entry point, the IBCF shall generate a new initial
INVITE request and forward it to the I-CSCF. In case the initial INVITE
request is received from own network, i.e. the IBCF acts as an exit point, the
IBCF shall generate a new initial INVITE request and forward it to the entry
point of the other network.
An IBCF may ~~provide~~[replace]{.underline} a contact address ~~that is not a
GRUU~~[with a URI of its own]{.underline} when the contact address in the
incoming message ~~that is being replaced~~ is not a GRUU [(e.g when the
contact address is an IP address)]{.underline}. ~~In all other cases it shall
use a GRUU. When using a GRUU, it shall do so in conformance with RFC 5627
[93].~~
~~This specification does not define how GRUUs are created by the IBCF; they
can be provisioned by the operator or obtained by any other mechanism. The
GRUU shall remain valid for the time period in which features addressed to it
remain meaningful.~~
~~The IBCF shall handle requests addressed to its currently valid GRUUs when
received outside of the dialog in which the GRUU was provided.~~
~~EXAMPLE: Upon receipt of an INVITE request addressed to a GRUU assigned to a
dialog it has active, and containing a Replaces header referencing that
dialog, the IBCF will be able to establish the new call replacing the old
one.~~
[The IBCF shall transparently forward a received Contact header field when the
Contact header field contains a GRUU or a media feature tag is included
indicating a capability for which the Contact URI can be used by the remote
party. When transparently forwarding a received Contact header field of a
dialog-forming request, the IBCF shall include its own URI in a Record-Route
header field in order to ensure that it is included on the route of subsequent
requests.]{.underline}
[NOTE: One examples of such a media feature tag is the isfocus media feature
tag used by conference services to transport the temporary conference identity
that can be used when rejoining an ongoing conference.]{.underline}
The internal function of the IBCF as an IMS-ALG is defined in 3GPP TS 29.162
[11A].
##### 5.10.6 Screening of SIP signalling {#screening-of-sip-signalling .H6}
##### 5.10.6.1 General {#general-10 .H6}
The IBCF may act as a B2BUA when it performs screening of SIP signalling
functionality. In this case the B2BUA behaviour of the IBCF shall comply with
the description given in subclause 5.10.5 for the IMS-ALG functionality.
NOTE: Many headers are intended for end-to-end operation; removal of such
headers will impact the intended end-to-end operation between the end users.
Additionally the IM CN subsystem does not preclude security mechanisms
covering SIP headers; any such removal ~~can~~ [may]{.underline} prevent
validation of all headers covered by the security mechanism. [Further study in
release 2 will be given to specifying procedures that can act in a more
transparent manner to the end user for some of these screening functions, and
therefore allow the screening function to use proxy behaviour. Use of draft-
ietf-sipping-media-policy-dataset, draft-hilt-sipping-policy-package, draft-
hilt-sipping-policy-usecases, draft-hilt-sipping-session-policy-framework,
draft-hilt-sipping-session-spec-policy, and draft-camarillo-sipping-sbc-funcs
will be investigated for this purpose.]{.underline}
##### 5.10.6.2 IBCF procedures for SIP headers {#ibcf-procedures-for-sip-
headers .H6}
If specified by local policy rules, the IBCF may omit or modify any
[other]{.underline} received SIP headers prior to forwarding SIP messages,
with the following exceptions.
As a result of any screening policy adopted, the IBCF should not modify at
least the following headers which would cause mis-operation of the IM CN
subsystem:
\- Authorization; and
\- WWW-Authenticate.
Where the IBCF appears in the path between the UE and the S‑CCF, some headers
are involved in the registration and authentication of the user. As a result
of any screening policy adopted as part of normal operation, e.g. where the
request or response is forwarded on, the IBCF should not modify as part of the
registration procedure at least the following headers:
\- Path; and
\- Service-Route.
NOTE 1: If the IBCF modifies SIP information elements (SIP headers, SIP
message bodies) other than as specified by SIP procedures (e.g., RFC 3261
[26]) caution needs to be taken that SIP functionality (e.g., routeing using
Route, Record-Route and Via) is not impacted in a way that could create
interoperability problems with networks that assume that this information is
not modified.
NOTE 2: Where operator requirements can be achieved by configuration hiding,
then these procedures can be used in preference to screening.
The IBCF may add, remove, or modify, the P-Early-Media header within forwarded
SIP requests and responses according to procedures in draft-ejzak-sipping-p-
em-auth [109].
NOTE 3: The IBCF can use the header for the gate control procedures, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D]. In the presence of early media for multiple
dialogs due to forking, if the IBCF is able to identify the media associated
with a dialog, (i.e., if symmetric RTP is used by the UE and the IBCF can use
the remote SDP information to determine the source of the media) the IBCF can
selectively open the gate corresponding to an authorized early media flow for
the selected media.
[When the IBCF, located in the home network, receives a SIP request from
another entity within the same trust domain, the IBCF may police the ICSI
value contained in the P-Asserted-Service header field.]{.underline}
##### 5.10.6.3 IBCF procedures for SIP message bodies {#ibcf-procedures-for-
sip-message-bodies .H6}
If IP address translation (NA(P)T or IP version interworking) occurs on the
user plane, the IBCF shall modify SDP according to the
[corresponding]{.underline} annex F and G ~~as appropriate.~~
Additionally, the IBCF may take the followings action upon SIP message bodies:
1) examine the length of a SIP message body and if required by local policy,
[and]{.underline} take an appropriate action\ (e.g. forward the message body
transparently, reject the request, remove the body);
2) examine the characteristics of the message body (i.e. check the values of
any \"Content-Type\",\ \"Content-Disposition\", and \"Content-Language\"
headers), take an appropriate action defined by local policy (e.g. forward the
body unchanged, remove the body, reject the call); and
3) examine the content of SIP bodies, and take appropriate action defined by
local policy (e.g. forward the body unchanged, remove the body, reject the
call). [ ]{.underline}
###### 5.11.2 UE originating case
The E-CSCF may either forward the call to a PSAP in the IP network or forward
the call to a PSAP in the PSTN. In the latter case the call will pass a BGCF
and a MGCF before entering the PSTN.
Upon receipt of an initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction,
or an unknown method including a Request-URI with an emergency service URN,
i.e. a service URN with a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in
draft-ietf-ecrit-service-urn [69], or an emergency number the E-CSCF shall:
1) remove its own SIP URI from the topmost Route header;
2) if the PSAP is the next hop, store the value of the icid parameter received
in the P-Charging-Vector header and remove the received information in the
P-Charging-Vector header, else keep the P-Charging-Vector if the next hop is
an exit IBCF or a BGCF;
3) if the PSAP is the next hop remove the P-Charging-Function-Addresses
headers, if present, else keep the P-Charging-Function-Addresses headers if
the next hop is an exit IBCFor an BGCF;
4) if an IBCF or BGCF is the next hop insert a type 2 orig-ioi parameter into
the P-Charging-Vector header. The E-CSCF shall set the type 2 orig-ioi
parameter to a value that identifies the sending network. The E-CSCF shall not
include the term-ioi parameter;
5) get location information as
\- geographical location information received as a location object from a
message body with the content type application/pidf+xml in accordance with
draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance [89]; and
\- location identifier as derived from the P-Access-Network ~~Network~~-Info
header, if available.
NOTE 1: The E-CSCF can request location information from an LRF. The protocol
used to retrieve the location information from the LRF is not specified in
this version of the specification.
NOTE 2: As an alternative to retrieve location information from the LRF the
E-CSCF can also request location information from an external server. The
address to the external server can be received in the Geolocation header as
specified in draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance [89]. The protocol used to
retrieve the location information from the external server is not specified in
this version of the specification.
6) select, based on location information and optionally type of emergency
service:
\- a PSAP connected to the IM CN subsystem network and add the PSAP URI to the
topmost Route header; or
NOTE 3: The E-CSCF conveys the P-Access-Network-Info header containing the
location identifier[, if defined for the access type as specified in subclause
7.2A.4,]{.underline} to the PSAP.
\- a PSAP in the PSTN, add the BGCF URI to the topmost Route header field, add
a PSAP URI in tel URI format to the Request-URI with an entry used in the
PSTN/CS domain to address the PSAP and set the handling header field parameter
value of the Content-Disposition header field associated with the
application/pidf+xml message body (if present) to \"optional\";
NOTE 4: The E-CSCF conveys the P-Access-Network-Info header containing the
location identifier[, if defined for the access type as specified in subclause
7.2A.4,]{.underline} towards the MGCF. The MGCF can translate the location
Information if included in INVITE (i.e. both the geographical location
information in PIDF-LO and the location identifier in the P-Access-Network-
Info header) into ISUP signalling, see 3GPP TS 29.163 [11B].
NOTE 5: The E-CSCF can request location information and routeing information
from the LRF. The E-CSCF can for example send the location identifier to LRF
and LRF maps the location identifier into the corresponding geographical
location information that LRF sends to E-CSCF. The LRF can invoke an RDF to
convert the location information into a proper PSAP/EC URI. Both the location
information and the PSAP URI are returned to the E-CSCF.
NOTE 6: The way the E-CSCF determines the next hop address when the PSAP
address is a tel URI is implementation dependent.
7) if the E-CSCF receives a reference number from the LRF the E-CSCF shall
include the reference number in the P-Asserted-Identity header;
NOTE 7: The reference number is used in the communication between the PSAP and
LRF.
8) if due to local policy or if the PSAP requires interconnect functionalities
(e.g. PSAP address is of an IP address type other than the IP address type
used in the IM CN subsystem), put the address of the IBCF to the topmost route
header, in order to forward the request to the PSAP via an IBCF in the same
network;
9) create a Record-Route header containing its own SIP URI
10) if the request is an INVITE request, save the Contact, Cseq and Record-
Route header field values received in the request such that the E-CSCF is able
to release the session if needed; and
11) route the request based on SIP routeing procedures.
Editor\'s Note: It needs to be investigated whether the E-CSCF also needs
(under specific circumstances) to release an emergency session.
NOTE 8: Depending on local operator policy, the E-CSCF has the capability to
reject requests relating to specific methods in accordance with RFC 3261 [26],
as an alternative to the functionality described above.
Upon receipt of an initial request for a dialog, a standalone transaction, or
an unknown method, that does not include a Request-URI with an emergency
service URN or an emergency number, the E-CSCF shall reject the call by
sending a 403 (Forbidden) response.
When the E-CSCF receives the request containing the access-network-charging-
info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector, the E-CSCF shall store the access-
network-charging-info parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header. The E-CSCF
shall retain access-network-charging-info parameter in the P-Charging-Vector
header.
When the E-CSCF receives any request or response (excluding ACK requests and
CANCEL requests and responses) related to a UE-originated dialog or standalone
transaction, the E-CSCF may insert previously saved values into P-Charging-
Vector and P-Charging-Function-Addresses headers before forwarding the
message.
When the E-CSCF receives an INVITE request from the UE, the E-CSCF may require
the periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the E-CSCF. If
the E-CSCF requires the session to be refreshed, it shall apply the procedures
described in RFC 4028 [58] clause 8.
NOTE 9: Requesting the session to be refreshed requires support by at least
the UE or the PSAP or MGCF. This functionality cannot automatically be
granted, i.e. at least one of the involved UAs needs to support it in order to
make it work.
##### 6 Application usage of SDP {#application-usage-of-sdp .H6}
##### 6.1.1 General {#general-11 .H6}
The \"integration of resource management and SIP\" extension is hereafter in
this subclause referred to as \"the precondition mechanism\" and is defined in
RFC 3312 [30] as updated by RFC 4032 [64].
In order to authorize the media streams, the P‑CSCF and S‑CCF have to be able
to inspect the SDP payloads. Hence, the UE shall not encrypt the SDP payloads.
During session establishment procedure, SIP messages shall only contain SDP
payload if that is intended to modify the session description, or when the SDP
payload must be included in the message because of SIP rules described in RFC
3261 [26].
For \"video\" and \"audio\" media types that utilize the RTP/RTCP, the UE
shall specify the proposed bandwidth for each media stream utilizing the
\"b=\" media descriptor and the \"AS\" bandwidth modifier in the SDP.
If the media line in the SDP indicates the usage of RTP/RTCP, and if the RTCP
bandwidth level for the session is different than the default RTCP bandwidth
as specified in RFC 3556 [56], then in addition to the \"AS\" bandwidth
modifier in the media-level \"b=\" line, the UE shall include two media-level
\"b=\" lines, one with the \"RS\" bandwidth modifier and the other with the
\"RR\" bandwidth modifier as described in RFC 3556 [56] to specify the
required bandwidth allocation for RTCP.
For other media streams the \"b=\" media descriptor may be included. The value
or absence of the \"b=\" parameter will affect the assigned QoS which is
defined in 3GPP 29.213 [13C].
NOTE 1: In a two-party session where both participants are active, the RTCP
receiver reports are not sent, therefore, the RR bandwidth modifier will
typically get the value of zero.
The UE shall include the MIME subtype \"telephone-event\" in the \"m=\" media
descriptor in the SDP for audio media flows that support both audio codec and
DTMF payloads in RTP packets as described in RFC 2833 [23].
[In case if the IP‑CAN requires any access specific procedures,
t]{.underline}he UE shall inspect the SDP contained in any SIP request or
response, looking for possible indications of grouping of media streams
according to RFC 3524 [54] and perform the appropriate actions for IP‑CAN
bearer establishment for media according to IP‑CAN specific procedures (see
subclause B.2.2.5 for IP‑CAN implemented using GPRS).
If resource reservation is needed, the UE shall start reserving its local
resources whenever it has sufficient information about the media streams,
media authorization and used codecs available.
NOTE 2: Based on this resource reservation can, in certain cases, be initiated
immediately after the sending or receiving of the initial SDP offer.
In order to fulfil the QoS requirements of one or more media streams, the UE
may re-use previously reserved resources. In this case the local preconditions
related to the media stream, for which resources are re-used, shall be
indicated as met.
If an IP‑CAN bearer is rejected or modified, the UE shall, if the SDP is
affected, update the remote SIP entity according to RFC 3261 [26] and RFC 3311
[29].
NOTE 3: The UE can use one IP address for signalling (and specify it in the
Contact header) and different IP address(es) for media (and specify it in the
\"c=\" parameter of the SDP).
If the UE wants to transport media streams with TCP and there are no specific
alternative negotiation mechanisms defined for that particular application,
then the UE shall support the procedures and the SDP rules specified in RFC
4145 [83].
###### 6.1.2 Handling of SDP at the originating UE
An INVITE request generated by a UE shall contain a SDP offer and at least one
media description. The SDP offer shall reflect the calling user\'s terminal
capabilities and user preferences for the session. The UE shall order the SDP
offer with the most preferred codec listed first.
If the desired QoS resources for one or more media streams have not been
reserved at the UE when constructing the SDP offer, the UE shall:
\- indicate the related local preconditions for QoS as not met, using the
segmented status type, as defined in RFC 3312 [30] and RFC 4032 [64], as well
as the strength-tag value \"mandatory\" for the local segment and the
strength-tag value \"optional\" for the remote segment[, if the UE supports
the precondition mechanism (see subclause 5.1.3.1)]{.underline}; and,
\- set the related media streams to inactive, by including an \"a=inactive\"
line, according to the procedures described in RFC 4566 [39], unless the UE
knows that the precondition mechanism is supported by the remote UE.
NOTE 1: When setting the media streams to the inactive mode, the UE can
include in the first SDP offer the proper values for the RS and RR modifiers
and associate bandwidths to prevent the receiving of the RTCP packets, and not
send any RTCP packets.
If the desired QoS resources for one or more media streams are available at
the UE when the SDP offer is sent, the UE shall indicate the related local
preconditions as met, using the segmented status type, as defined in RFC 3312
[30] and RFC 4032 [64], as well as the strength-tag value \"mandatory\" for
the local segment and the strength-tag value \"optional\" for the remote
segment, if the UE supports the precondition mechanism (see subclause
5.1.3.1).
NOTE 2: If the originating UE does not support the precondition mechanism it
will not include any precondition information in SDP.
Upon generating the SDP offer for an INVITE request generated after receiving
a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response, as described in subclause 5.1.3.1, the
UE shall include SDP payload containing a subset of the allowed media types,
codecs and other parameters from the SDP payload of all 488 (Not Acceptable
Here) responses related to the same session establishment attempt (i.e. a set
of INVITE requests used for the same session establishment). The UE shall
order the codecs in the SDP payload according to the order of the codecs in
the SDP payload of the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response.
NOTE 3: The UE can attempt a session establishment through multiple networks
with different policies and potentially can need to send multiple INVITE
requests and receive multiple 488 (Not Acceptable Here) responses from
different CSCF nodes. The UE therefore takes into account the SDP contents of
all the 488 (Not Acceptable Here) responses received related to the same
session establishment when building a new INVITE request.
Upon confirming successful local resource reservation, the UE shall create a
SDP offer in which:
\- the related local preconditions are set to met, using the segmented status
type, as defined in RFC 3312 [30] and RFC 4032 [64]; and
\- the media streams previously set to inactive mode are set to active
(sendrecv, sendonly or recvonly) mode.
Upon receiving an SDP answer, which includes more than one codec for one or
more media streams, the UE shall send an SDP offer at the first possible time,
selecting only one codec per media stream.
##### 6.2 Procedures at the P‑CSCF {#procedures-at-the-pcscf .H6}
When the P‑CSCF receives any SIP request containing an SDP offer, the P‑CSCF
shall examine the media parameters in the received SDP. If the P‑CSCF finds
any media parameters which are not allowed on the network by local policy, the
P‑CSCF shall return a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response containing SDP
payload. This SDP payload contains either all the media types, codecs and
other SDP parameters which are allowed according to the local policy, or,
based on configuration by the operator of the P‑CSCF, a subset of these
allowed parameters. This subset may depend on the content of the received SIP
request. The P‑CSCF shall build the SDP payload in the 488 (Not Acceptable
Here) response in the same manner as a UAS builds the SDP in a 488 (Not
Acceptable Here) response as specified in RFC 3261 [26]. The P‑CSCF shall
order the SDP payload with the most preferred codec listed first. If the SDP
offer is encrypted, the P‑CSCF may reject the request.
When the P‑CSCF receives a SIP response different from 200 (OK) response
containing [an]{.underline} SDP offer, the P‑CSCF shall not examine the media
parameters in the received SDP offer, but the P‑CSCF shall rather check the
succeeding request containing the SDP answer for this offer, and if necessary
(i.e. the SDP answer reduced by the UE still breaches local policy), the
P‑CSCF shall return a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response containing the local
policy allowed SDP payload. If the SDP answer is encrypted, the P‑CSCF may
reject the succeeding request.
When the P‑CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response containing SDP offer, the P‑CSCF
shall examine the media parameters in the received SDP. If the P‑CSCF finds
any media parameters which are not allowed on the network by local policy, the
P‑CSCF shall forward the SDP offer and on the receipt of the ACK request
containing the SDP answer, it shall immediately terminate the session as
described in subclause 5.2.8.1.2. If the SDP offer is encrypted, the P‑CSCF
shall forward the SDP offer and on the receipt of the ACK request containing
the SDP answer, it may immediately terminate the session as described in
subclause 5.2.8.1.2.
[When the P‑CSCF receives any SIP request containing an SDP offer for which
resource authorization procedure over the Gq\' interface is required (e.g. in
case the P‑CSCF is serving a UE connected to a fixed broadband access), upon
receipt of an indication over the Gq\' interface that the requested resources
for a multimedia session currently being established cannot be granted (e.g.
AA-Answer message from SPDF with appropriate reservation failure indication),
the P‑CSCF shall terminate this received request and answer it with a 500
(Server Internal Error) response.]{.underline}
[When the P‑CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response containing an SDP offer, for
which resource authorization procedure over the Gq\' interface is required
(e.g. in case the P‑CSCF is serving a UE connected to a fixed broadband
access), upon receipt of an indication over the Gq\' interface that the
requested resources for a multimedia session currently being established
cannot be granted (e.g. AA-Answer message from SPDF with appropriate
reservation failure indication), the P‑CSCF shall check the SIP message
containing the SDP answer for this SDP offer, and if necessary (i.e. a new
indication that resources cannot be granted is received by the P‑CSCF over the
Gq\' interface), the P‑CSCF shall terminate the session as described in
subclause 5.2.8.1.2.]{.underline}
In case a device performing address and/or port number conversions is provided
by a NA(P)T or NA(P)t-PT controlled by the P‑CSCF, or by a hosted NAT[,
located along the media path,]{.underline} the P‑CSCF may need to modify the
media connection data in SDP bodies according to the procedures described in F
and/or annex G.
The P‑CSCF shall apply and maintain the same policy within the SDP from the
initial request or response containing SDP and throughout the complete SIP
session. The P‑CSCF may inspect, if present, the \"b=RS\" and \"b=RR\" lines
in order to find out the bandwidth allocation requirements for RTCP.

##### 7.2A.4.3 Additional coding rules for P-Access-Network-Info header
{#a.4.3-additional-coding-rules-for-p-access-network-info-header .H6}
[~~The UE~~Entities inserting the P-Access-Network-Info header]{.underline}
shall populate the P-Access-Network-Info header, where use is specified in
subclause 5.1 and subclause 5.2, with the following contents:
1) the access-type field set to one of \"3GPP-GERAN\",\"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\",
\"3GPP-UTRAN-TDD\", \"3GPP2‑1X\", \"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", \"IEEE-802.11\",
\"IEEE-802.11a\", \"IEEE-802.11b\" \"IEEE-802.11g\", \"ADSL\", \"ADSL2\",
\"ADSL2+\", \"RADSL\", \"SDSL\", \"HDSL\", \"HDSL2\", \"G.SHDSL\", \"VDSL\",
\"IDSL\" [,]{.underline} \"DOCSIS\" [or \"IEEE-802.3\", \"IEEE-802.3a\",

IEEE-802.3an\", \"IEEE-802.3y\" or \"IEEE-802.3z\"]{.underline} as appropriate
to the access technology in use.
2) if the access type field is set to \"3GPP-GERAN\", a cgi-3gpp parameter set
to the Cell Global Identity obtained from lower layers of the UE. The Cell
Global Identity is a concatenation of MCC, MNC, LAC and CI (as described in
3GPP TS 23.003 [3]). The value of \"cgi-3gpp\" parameter is therefore coded as
a text string as follows:
> Starting with the most significant bit, MCC (3 digits), MNC (2 or 3 digits
> depending on MCC value), LAC (fixed length code of 16 bits using full
> hexadecimal representation) and CI (fixed length code of 16 bits using a
> full hexadecimal representation);
3) if the access type field is equal to \"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", or \"3GPP-UTRAN-
TDD\", a \"utran-cell-id-3gpp\" parameter set to a concatenation of the MCC,
MNC, LAC (as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3]) and the UMTS Cell Identity (as
described in 3GPP TS 25.331 [9A]), obtained from lower layers of the UE, and
is coded as a text string as follows:
> Starting with the most significant bit, MCC (3 digits), MNC (2 or 3 digits
> depending on MCC value), LAC (fixed length code of 16 bits using full
> hexadecimal representation) and UMTS Cell Identity (fixed length code of 28
> bits);
4) if the access type field is set to \"3GPP2-1X\", a ci-3gpp2 parameter set
to the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value of the string obtained by
the concatenation of SID (16 bits), NID (16 bits), PZID (8 bits) and BASE_ID
(16 bits) (see 3GPP2 C.S0005-D [85]) in the specified order. The length of the
ci-3gpp2 parameter shall be 14 hexadecimal characters. The hexadecimal
characters (A through F) shall be coded using the uppercase ASCII characters.
If the MS does not know the values for any of the above parameters, the MS
shall use the value of 0 for that parameter. For example, if the SID is
unknown, the MS shall represent the SID as 0x0000;
NOTE 1: The SID value is represented using 16 bits as supposed to 15 bits as
specified in 3GPP2 C.S0005-D [85].
EXAMPLE: If SID = 0x1234, NID = 0x5678, PZID = 0x12, BASE_ID = 0xFFFF, the
ci-3gpp2 value is set to the string \"1234567812FFFF\".
5) if the access type field is set to \"3GPP2-1X-HRPD\", a ci-3gpp2 parameter
set to the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value of the string
obtained by the concatenation of Sector ID (128 bits) and Subnet length\ (8
bits) (see 3GPP2 C.S0024-A [86]) in the specified order. The length of the
ci-3gpp2 parameter shall be 34 hexadecimal characters. The hexadecimal
characters (A through F) shall be coded using the uppercase ASCII characters;
EXAMPLE: If the Sector ID = 0x12341234123412341234123412341234, Subnet length
= 0x11, the ci-3gpp2 value is set to the string
\"1234123412341234123412341234123411\".
6) if the access-type field set to one of \"IEEE-802.11\", \"IEEE-802.11a\",
\"IEEE-WLAN-802.11b\" or \"IEEE‑802.11g\", an \"i-wlan-node-id\" parameter is
set to [the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value of]{.underline} the
[AP\'s]{.underline} MAC address ~~of the AP~~ [without any delimiting
characters]{.underline}.
[EXAMPLE: If the AP\'s MAC address = 00-0C-F1-12-60-28, then i-wlan-node-id is
set to the string \"000cf1126028\".]{.underline}
7) If the access-type field is set to one of \"ADSL\", \"ADSL2\", \"ADSL2+\",
\"RADSL\", \"SDSL\", \"HDSL\", \"HDSL2\", \"G.SHDSL\", \"VDSL\", \"IDSL\", the
access-info field shall contain a dsl-location parameter obtained from the CLF
(see NASS functional architecture) ; and
8) if the access-type field set to \"DOCSIS\", the access info parameter is
set to a null value. This release of this specification does not define values
for use in this parameter.
[9) if the access-type field is set to one of \"IEEE-802.3\", \"IEEE-802.3a\",
\"IEEE-802.3e\", \"IEEE-802.3i\", \"IEEE-802.3j\", \"IEEE-802.3u\",
\"IEEE-802.3ab\", \"IEEE-802.3ae\", IEEE-802.3ak\", IEEE-802.3aq\",
IEEE-802.3an\", \"IEEE-802.3y\"or \"IEEE-802.3z\"\", the access-info field
shall contain an eth-location parameter obtained from the CLF (see NASS
functional architecture).]{.underline}
NOTE 2: The \"cgi-3gpp\", the \"utran-cell-id-3gpp\", the \"ci-3gpp2\", the
\"i-wlan-node-id\", and the \"dsl-location\" parameters described above among
other usage also constitute the location identifiers that are used for IMS
emergency services.
If the P‑CSCF receives an initial request for a dialog or standalone
transaction or an unknown method and:
\- the request includes a P-Access-Network-Info header with a \"network-
provided\" parameter the P‑CSCF shall remove the P-Access-Network-Info header;
\- the request is sent using xDSL as an IP‑CAN the P‑CSCF may insert a
P-Access-Network-Info header into the request by setting the access-type field
to one of \"ADSL\", \"ADSL2\", \"ADSL2+\", \"RADSL\", \"SDSL\", \"HDSL\",
\"HDSL2\", \"G.SHDSL\", \"VDSL\", or \"IDSL\", adding the \"network-provided\"
parameter and the\ \"dsl-location\" parameter with the value received in the
Location-Information header in the User-Data Answer command as specified in
ETSI ES 283 035 [98]; and
[- the request is sent using Ethernet as an IP‑CAN the P‑CSCF may insert a
P-Access-Network-Info header into the request by setting the access-type field
to one of \"IEEE-802.3\", \"IEEE-802.3a\", \"IEEE-802.3e\", \"IEEE-802.3i\",

location\" parameter with the value received in the Location-Information
header in the User-Data Answer command as specified in ETSI ES 283 035
[98];]{.underline}
NOTE 3: The way the P‑CSCF deduces that the request comes using xDSL access is
implementation dependent.
Editor\'s Note: Insertion of P-Access-Network-Info header by a P‑CSCF is not
allowed according to RFC 3455 [52].
\- the request is sent using DOCSIS as an IP‑CAN the P‑CSCF may insert a
P-Access-Network-Info header into the request by setting the access-type field
to \"DOCSIS\" and including the \"network-provided\" parameter.

##### 7.2A.5.2.1 General
The syntax of the P-Charging-Vector header field is described in RFC 3455
[52]. There may be additional coding rules for this header depending on the
type of IP-CAN, according to access technology specific descriptions.

[NOTE: The syntax above is not aligned with the rules for defining new
P-Charging-Vector header field parameters as defined in RFC 3455 [52].
Entities that perform syntax check (even if they are not interested in
specific header field parameter values) of the header field need to follow the
explicit syntax above, as using the rules in RFC 3455 [52] would trigger a
parser error.]{.underline}
The access-network-charging-info parameter is an instance of generic-param
from the current charge-params component of P-Charging-Vector header.
The access-network-charging-info parameter includes alternative definitions
for different types access networks. The description of these parameters are
given in the subsequent subclauses.
The access network charging information is not included in the P-Charging-
Vector for SIP signalling that is not associated with a session.
When the access network charging information is included in the P-Charging-
Vector and necessary information is not available from the Gx/Rx interface
reference points then null or zero values are included.
For type 1 and type 3 IOIs, the generating SIP entity shall express the orig-
ioi and term-ioi parameters in the format of a quoted string as specified in
RFC 3455 [52] with a specific string prefix being \"Type 1\" and \"Type 3\"
respectively to indicate the type of IOI. For the type 2 IOI, no string prefix
is used. The receiving SIP entity does not perform syntactic checking of the
contents of the IOI parameter (the IOI parameter is passed unmodified to
charging entities).
###### 7.2A.5.2.2 GPRS as IP-CAN
GPRS is the initially supported access network (gprs-charging-info parameter).
For GPRS there are the following components to track: GGSN address (ggsn
parameter), media authorization token (auth token parameter), and a pdp-info
parameter that contains the information for one or more PDP contexts. In this
release the media authorization token is set to zero. The pdp-info contains
one or more pdp-item values followed by a collection of parameters (pdp-sig,
gcid, and flow-id). The value of the pdp-item is a unique number that
identifies each of the PDP-related charging information within the P-Charging-
Vector header. Each PDP context has an indicator if it is an IM CN subsystem
signalling PDP context (pdp-sig parameter), an associated GPRS Charging
Identifier (gcid parameter), and a identifier (flow-id parameter). The flow-id
parameter contains a sequence of curly bracket delimited flow identifier
tuples that identify associated m-lines and relative order of port numbers in
an m-line within the SDP from the SIP signalling to which the PDP context
charging information applies. For a complete description of the semantics of
the flow-id parameter see 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D] Annex B. The gcid, ggsn address
and flow-id parameters are transferred from the GGSN to the P-CSCF via the
PCRF over the Rx interface (see 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D] and Gx interface (see
3GPP TS 29.212 [13B]).
The gcid value is received in binary format at the P-CSCF (see 3GPP TS 29.214
[13D]). The P-CSCF shall encode it in hexadecimal format before include it
into the gcid parameter. On receipt of this header, a node receiving a gcid
shall decode from hexadecimal into binary format.
The access network charging information is not included in the P-Charging-
Vector for SIP signalling [that is not associated with a multimedia session.
The access network charging information]{.underline} may ~~not~~ be
[un]{.underline}available for sessions that use a general purpose PDP context
(for both SIP signalling and media) or that do not require media
authorisation.
###### 7.2A.8.2 Coding of the ICSI
This parameter is coded as a URN. The ICSI URN may be included
as[:]{.underline}
\- a [tag value]{.underline} ~~quoted string as a value of~~ within the
[g.3gpp.icsi-ref]{.underline} ~~g.ims.app-ref~~ media feature tag as defined
in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62] [shall be represented in the escaped

###### 7.2A.9.2 Coding of the IARI
This parameter is coded as a URN. The IARI URN may be included as a quoted
string as a value of the g.ims.~~app~~[iari]{.underline}-ref media feature tag
as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62][, in which case those
characters of the URN that are not part of the tag-value definition in RFC

#### 7.2A.10.3 Additional coding rules for phone-context parameter
In case the current IP-CAN is indicated in the phone-context the entities
inserting the \"phone-context\" parameter shall populate the \"phone-context\"
parameter with the following contents:
1) if the IP-CAN is GPRS, then the \"phone-context\" parameter is a domain
name. It is constructed from the MCC, the MNC and the home network domain name
by concatenating the MCC, MNC, and the string \"gprs\" as domain labels before
the home network domain name;
EXAMPLE: If MCC = 216, MNC = 01, then the \"phone-context\" parameter is set
to \'216.01.gprs.home1.net\'.
2) if the IP-CAN is I-WLAN, then the \"phone-context\" parameter is a domain
name. It is constructed from the SSID, AP\'s MAC address, and the home network
domain name by concatenating the SSID, AP\'s MAC address, and the string
\"i-wlan\" as domain labels before the home network domain name;
EXAMPLE: If SSID = BU-Airport, AP\'s MAC = 00-0C-F1-12-60-28, and home network
domain name is \"home1.net\", then the \"phone-context\" parameter is set to
the string \"bu-airport.000cf1126028.i-wlan.home1.net\".
3) if the IP-CAN is xDSL, then the \"phone-context\" parameter is a domain
name. It is constructed from the dsl-location (see subclause 7.2A.4) and the
home network domain name by concatenating the dsl-location and the string
\"xdsl\" as domain labels before the home network domain name;
4) if the IP-CAN is DOCSIS, then the \"phone-context\" parameter is based on
data configured locally in the UE; and
[4a) if the IP-CAN is Ethernet, then the \"phone-context\" parameter is a
domain name. It is constructed from the eth-location (see subclause 7.2A.4)
and the home network domain name by concatenating the eth-location and the
string \"ethernet\" as domain labels before the home network domain name;
and]{.underline}
5) if the access network information is not available in the UE, then the
\"phone-context\" parameter is set to the home network domain name preceded by
the string \"geo-local\".
In case the home domain is indicated in the phone-context, the \"phone-
context\" parameter is set to the home network domain name (as it is used to
address the SIP REGISTER request, see subclause 5.1.1.1A).
In case the \"phone-context\" parameter indicates a network other than the
home network or the visited access network, the \"phone-context\" parameter is
set according to RFC 3966 [22].

features.]{.underline}
[**test:** This is a test call that has been originated as part of a
maintenance procedure.]{.underline}
[**operator:** The call was generated by an operator position.]{.underline}
[**payphone:** The calling station is a payphone.]{.underline}
[**unknown:** The CPC could not be ascertained.]{.underline}
[**mobile-hplmn:** The call was generated by a mobile device in its home
PLMN.]{.underline}
[**mobile-vplmn:** The call was generated by a mobile device in a vistited
PLMN.]{.underline}
[**emergency:** The call is an emergency service call.]{.underline}
[NOTE 1: The choice of CPC and OLI values and their use are up to the Service
Provider. CPC and OLI values can be exchanged across networks if specified in

### [7.2A.13 \"sos\" SIP URI parameter]{.underline}
#### [7.2A.13.1 Introduction]{.underline}
[The \"sos\" SIP URI parameter is intended to:]{.underline}
[- indicate to the S-CSCF that a REGISTER request that includes the \"sos\"
SIP URI parameter is for emergency registration purposes;]{.underline}
[- tell the S-CSCF to not apply barring of the public user identity being
registered; and]{.underline}
[- tell the S-CSCF to not apply initial filter criteria to requests destined
for an emergency registered contact.]{.underline}
#### [7.2A.13.2 Syntax]{.underline}
[The syntax for the \"sos\" SIP URI parameter is specified in table
7.8]{.underline}
[Table 7.8: Syntax of sos SIP URI parameter]{.underline}
[uri-parameter =/ sos-param]{.underline}
[sos-param = \"sos\"]{.underline}
[]{.underline}
[The BNF for uri-parameter is taken from IETF RFC 3261 [26] and modified
accordingly.]{.underline}
#### [7.2A.13.3 Operation]{.underline}
[When a UE includes the \"sos\" SIP URI parameter in the URI included in the
Contact header field of REGISTER request, the REGISTER request is intended for
emergency registration.]{.underline}
[When a S-CSCF receives a REGISTER request for emergency registration that
includes the \"sos\" SIP URI parameter, the S-CSCF is required to preserve the
previously registered contact address. This differs to the registrar operation
as defined in RFC 3261 [26] in that the rules for URI comparison for the
Contact header field shall not apply and thus, if the URI in the Contact
header field matches a previously received URI, then the old contact address
shall not be overwritten.]{.underline}
### 7.6.1 General
This subclause contains the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem XML body in XML format. The
3GPP IM CN Subsystem XML shall be valid against the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem XML
schema defined in table 7.7[A]{.underline}.
Any SIP User Agent or proxy may insert or remove the 3GPP IM CN subsystem XML
body or parts of it, as required, in any SIP message. The 3GPP IM CN subsystem
XML body shall not be forwarded outside a 3GPP network.
The associated MIME type with the 3GPP IMS XML body is \"application/3gpp-
ims+xml\".
### 7.6.2 Document Type Definition

### 7.6.3 XML Schema description
This subclause describes the elements of the IMS Document Type Definition as
defined in table 7.7[A]{.underline}.
\: This is the root element of the IMS XML body. It shall always be
present. [XML instance documents of future versions of the XML Schema in table
7.7A shall be valid against the XML Schema in table 7.7A in this document. XML
instance documents of the XML Schema in table 7.7A in the present document
shall have a version attribute value, part of the ims-3gpp element, that is
equal to the value of the XML Schema version described in the present
document.]{.underline}
\: the transparent element received from the HSS for a
particular trigger point are placed within this optional element.
\: in the present document, the alternative service is
used as a response for an attempt to establish an emergency session within the
IM CN subsystem. The element describes an alternative service where the call
should success. The alternative service is described by the type of service
information. A possible reason cause why an alternative service is suggested
may be included.
The \ element contains a \ element that indicates
the type of alternative service and an \ element, an optional element.
The \ element contains only the value [specified in table
7.7AA]{.underline} ~~\"emergency\"~~ in the present document.
[Table 7.7AA: ABNF syntax of value of the \ element]{.underline}

##### B.2.2.1 PDP context activation and P-CSCF discovery {#b.2.2.1-pdp-
context-activation-and-p-cscf-discovery .H6}
Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall:
a) perform a GPRS attach procedure;
[If the bearer establishment is controlled by the UE the UE starts reserving
its local resources whenever it has sufficient information about the media
streams, media authorization and used codecs available as specified in 3GPP TS
24.008 [8].]{.underline}
[NOTE 1: If the bearer establishment is controlled by the GPRS IP CAN the
resource reservation requests are initiated by the GGSN after the P-CSCF has
authorised the respective IP flows and provided the QoS requirements over the
Rx interface to the PCRF as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D].]{.underline}
[NOTE 1A: During the PDP context activation procedure it is negotiated whether
the UE or the GPRS IP-CAN is responsible for establishing the applicable to
all PDP contexts within the activated PDP address/APN pair as described in
3GPP TS 24.008 [8].]{.underline}
b) ~~establish~~[ensure that]{.underline} a PDP context used for SIP
signalling according to the APN and GGSN selection criteria described in 3GPP
TS 23.060 [4] and 3GPP TS 27.060 [10A] [is available]{.underline}. This PDP
context shall remain active throughout the period the UE is connected to the
IM CN subsystem, i.e. from the initial registration and at least until the
deregistration. As a result, the PDP context provides the UE with information
that makes the UE able to construct an IPv6 address;
[When the bearer establishment is controlled by the UE,]{.underline}
[t]{.underline}~~T~~he UE shall choose one of the following options when
performing establishment of this PDP context:
I. A dedicated PDP context for SIP signalling:
> The UE shall indicate to the GGSN that this is a PDP context intended to
> carry IM CN subsystem-related signalling only by setting the IM CN Subsystem
> Signalling Flag. The UE may also use this PDP context for DNS and DHCP
> signalling according to the static packet filters as described in 3GPP TS
> 29.061 [11]. The UE can also set the Signalling Indication attribute within
> the QoS IE;
II. A general-purpose PDP context:
> The UE may decide to use a general-purpose PDP Context to carry IM CN
> subsystem-related signaling. The UE shall indicate to the GGSN that this is
> a general-purpose PDP context by not setting the IM CN Subsystem Signalling
> Flag. The UE may carry both signalling and media on the general-purpose PDP
> context. The UE can also set the Signalling Indication attribute within the
> QoS IE.
[NOTE 2: When the bearer establishment is controlled by the GPRS IP-CAN, the
GGSN follows the procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.061 [11] in order to
establish a dedicated PDP context for SIP signalling.]{.underline}
The UE indicates the IM CN Subsystem Signalling Flag to the GGSN within the
Protocol Configuration Options IE of the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message
or ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message. Upon successful signalling
PDP context establishment the UE receives an indication from GGSN in the form
of IM CN Subsystem Signalling Flag within the Protocol Configuration Options
IE. If the flag is not received, the UE shall consider the PDP context as a
general-purpose PDP context.
The encoding of the IM CN Subsystem Signalling Flag within the Protocol
Configuration Options IE is described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
The UE can indicate a request for prioritised handling over the radio
interface by setting the Signalling Indication attribute (see 3GPP TS 23.107
[4A]). The general QoS negotiation mechanism and the encoding of the
Signalling Indication attribute within the QoS IE are described in 3GPP TS
24.008 [8].
NOTE [3]{.underline}: A general-purpose PDP Context [can]{.underline}~~may~~
carry both IM CN subsystem signaling and media, in case the media does not
need to be authorized by Policy and Charging control mechanisms as defined in
3GPP TS 29.212 [13C] and Service Based Local Policy mechanisms defined in 3GPP
TS 29.207 [12] and the media stream is not mandated by the P-CSCF to be
carried in a separate PDP Context.
c) acquire a P-CSCF address(es).
The methods for P-CSCF discovery are:
I. Employ Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) RFC 3315 [40],
the DHCPv6 options for SIP servers RFC 3319 [41] and DHCPv6 options for Domain
Name Servers (DNS) RFC 3646 [56C] as described in subclause 9.2.1.
II. Transfer P-CSCF address(es) within the PDP context activation procedure.
The UE shall indicate the request for a P-CSCF address to the GGSN within the
Protocol Configuration Options IE of the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message
or ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message.
If the GGSN provides the UE with a list of P-CSCF IPv6 addresses in the
ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message or ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT
message, the UE shall assume that the list is prioritised with the first
address within the Protocol Configuration Options IE as the P-CSCF address
with the highest priority.
The UE can freely select method I or II for P-CSCF discovery. In case method I
is selected and several P-CSCF addresses or FQDNs are provided to the UE, the
selection of P-CSCF address or FQDN shall be performed as indicated in RFC
3319 [41]. If sufficient information for P-CSCF address selection is not
available, selection of the P-CSCF address by the UE is implementation
specific.
If the UE is designed to use I above, but receives P-CSCF address(es)
according to II, then the UE shall either ignore the received address(es), or
use the address(es) in accordance with II, and not proceed with the DHCP
request according to I.
The UE may request a DNS Server IPv6 address(es) via RFC 3315 [40] and RFC
3646 [56C] or by the Protocol Configuration Options IE when activating a PDP
context according to 3GPP TS 27.060 [10A].
The encoding of the request and response for IPv6 address(es) for DNS
server(s) and list of P-CSCF address(es) within the Protocol Configuration
Options IE is described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
##### B.2.2.6 Emergency service {#b.2.2.6-emergency-service .H6}
No IP-CAN specific procedures for emergency registration have been defined for
GPRS. However, when activating a PDP context to perform emergency
registration, based on the conditions in subclause 5.1.6.1 of this
specification, the UE can select an APN that results in selection of a GGSN
located in the PLMN to which the UE is attached (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [4]). The
procedures for PDP context activation and P-CSCF discovery, as described in
subclause B.2.2.1 of this specification apply accordingly.
NOTE 1: The UE discovery of the local APN is not in the scope of this
specification, but the UE can get information about such an APN e.g. via local
configuration.
In order to find out whether the UE is attached to the home PLMN or to the
visited PLMN, the UE shall compare the MCC values derived from its IMSI with
the MCC of the PLMN the UE is attached to. If the MCC of the PLMN the UE is
attached to does not match with the MCC derived from the IMSI, then for the
purpose of emergency calls in the IM CN subsystem the UE shall consider to be
attached to a VPLMN.
NOTE 2: In this respect an equivalent HPLMN, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [4C]
will be considered as a visited network.
[The type of emergency service for an emergency number is derived from the
settings of the emergency service category value (bits 1 to 5 of the emergency
service category value as specified in subclause 10.5.4.33 of 3GPP TS 24.008
[8]). Table B.2.2.6.1 below specifies mappings between a type of emergency
service and an emergency service URN. The UE shall use the mapping to match an
emergency service URN and a type of emergency service. If a dialled number is
an emergency number but does not map to a type of emergency service the
service URN shall be \"urn:service:sos\".]{.underline}

[If the IP-CAN did not provide a local emergency number that matches the
dialled number (see subclause 5.1.6.1) and multiple types of emergency service
can be derived for a dialled number from the information configured on the
USIM then:]{.underline}
[- if the UE is in the HPLMN, the UE shall map any one of these types of
emergency service to an emergency service URN as specified in table L.2.2.6.1;
and]{.underline}
[- if the UE is in the VPLMN, the UE shall select
\"urn:service:sos\".]{.underline}
[If the IP-CAN provided a local emergency number that matches the dialled
number (see subclause 5.1.6.1), and:]{.underline}
[- if the UE can derive one or more types of emergency service from the
information received from the IP-CAN for the dialled number and the UE cannot
derive types of emergency service from the information configured on the USIM
for the dialled number; or]{.underline}
[- if the UE is able to derive identical types of emergency service from both
the information received from the IP-CAN for the dialled number and from the
information configured on the USIM for the dialled number,]{.underline}
[then the UE shall map any one of these emergency service types to an
emergency service URN as specified in table L.2.2.6.1.]{.underline}
[NOTE 3: How the UE resolves clashes where an emergency number is associated
with one or more different types of emergency service configured in the USIM
and in information received from the access network, is implementation
dependent.]{.underline}
###### [B.2A.2 Handling of SDP at the terminating UE when originating UE has
resources available and IP-CAN performs network-initiated resource reservation
for terminating UE]{.underline}
[If the UE receives an SDP offer where the SDP offer includes all media
streams for which the originating side indicated its local preconditions as
met, if the precondition mechanism is supported by the terminating UE and the
IP-CAN performs network-initiated resource reservation for the terminating UE
and the available resources are not sufficient for the received offer the
terminating UE shall indicate its local preconditions and provide the SDP
answer to the originating side without waiting for resource
reservation.]{.underline}
[NOTE 1: If the resource reservation is controlled by the GPRS IP-CAN, the
resource reservation request is initiated by the GGSN after the P-CSCF has
authorised the respective IP flows and provided the QoS requirements over the
Rx interface to the PCRF as described in 3GPP TS 29.214 [13D].]{.underline}
[NOTE 2: During the PDP context activation procedure the UE and network
negotiate whether the UE or the GPRS IP-CAN is responsible to the resource
reservation applicable to all PDP contexts within the activated PDP
address/APN pair as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].]{.underline}

###### F.2.1.2.2 Initial registration
Subclause F.4.1 applies with the following modification to item d).
Modify item d) as follows:
d) a Contact header according to the following rules: if the REGISTER request
is sent without integrity protection, the Contact header shall be set to
include SIP URI(s) containing the private IP address of the UE in the hostport
parameter or FQDN. If the UE supports GRUU, it shall include a +sip.instance
parameter containing the instance ID. If the REGISTER request is integrity
protected, the UE shall include the public IP address or FQDN and the
protected server port value in the hostport parameter. The UE shall only use a
FQDN in a protected REGISTER request, if it is ensured that the FQDN resolves
to the public IP address of the NAT. If the UE supports GRUU, it shall include
a +sip.instance parameter containing the instance ID. [The UE shall include
all supported ICSI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) in a
g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62]
for the IMS communication services it intends to use, and IARI values (coded
as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2), for the IMS applications it intends to
use in a g.3gpp.iari-ref feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC
3840 [62]]{.underline};
###### F.2.1.2.4 User-initiated re-registration
Subclause F.4.1 applies with the following modification to item d).
Modify item d) as follows:
d) a Contact header set to include SIP URI(s) that contain(s) in the hostport
parameter the public IP address of the UE or FQDN and protected server port
value bound to the security association, and containing the instance ID of the
UE in the +sip.instance parameter, if the UE supports GRUU. The UE shall only
use a FQDN, if it is ensured that the FQDN resolves to the public IP address
of the NAT[. The UE shall include all supported ICSI values (coded as
specified in subclause 7.2A.8.2) in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref feature tag as defined
in subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 [62] for the IMS communication services it
intends to use, and IARI values (coded as specified in subclause 7.2A.9.2),
for the IMS applications it intends to use in a g.3gpp.iari-ref feature tag as
defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC 3840 [62]]{.underline};
##### [F.4A NAT traversal for media]{.underline} {#f.4a-nat-traversal-for-
media .H6}
[To keep NAT bindings and firewall pinholes open with uni-directional RTP
traffic and enable the C-BGF to perform address latching, the UE shall send
keep alive messages for each media stream. These messages shall be sent
regardless of whether the media stream is currently inactive, send only,
recvonly or sendrecv. It is recommended that the keepalive message be an empty
(no payload) RTP packet with a payload type of 20 as long as the other end has
not negotiated the use of this value. If this value has already been
negotiated, then some other unused static payload type from Table 5 of RFC
3551 [89] shall be used.]{.underline}
##### F.4.1 Introduction {#f.4.1-introduction .H6}
Subclause F.4.1 applies with the following modification to the first
paragraph.
Modify the first paragraph as follows:
[The procedures defined in subclause F.2 and F.3 remain unchanged except as
noted below when]{.underline} ~~This subclause describes the SIP procedures
for~~ supporting hosted NAT scenarios in case UDP encapsulated IPsec is not
employed. In these scenarios the procedures for NAT traversal must take into
account that all SIP requests and responses are not protected by an IPsec
security association.
##### F.4.2 Registration {#f.4.2-registration .H6}
[NOTE 1A: This subclause applies to initial registrations as well as to re-
registrations]{.underline}
The procedures described in subclause F.4.2 apply with the following
modifications.
When the P‑CSCF receives a REGISTER request from the UE, the P‑CSCF shall
behave as of subclause F.4.2 with the addition of sub-item 6a).
The P‑CSCF shall:
[6a) If a P‑CSCF registration timer is running, the P‑CSCF should not forward
the REGISTER request if received half of the time before expiry of the S‑CSCF
registration timer, unless the request is intended to update its capabilities
according to RFC 3840 [62] or to modify the ICSI values or IARI values that
the UE intends to use in the g.ims.app-ref feature tag. . In such cases it
shall build a 200 OK response, based on the contents of the 200 OK response to
the previous REGISTER request and forward this response to the
UE]{.underline}. [If the P-CSCF decides to forward the REGISTER request, it
shall set the registration expiration interval to the registration expiration
interval value indicated in the received 200 (OK) response to the previous
REGISTER request.]{.underline}
When the P‑CSCF receives a 200 (OK) response to a REGISTER request, the P‑CSCF
shall behave as of clause 5.2.2 with the addition of item 10:
[10) Modify the value of the Expires header field and/or Expires parameter in
the Contact header according to the transport protocol. In order to minimize
the number of REGISTER requests to the S‑CCF, it may also start a P‑CSCF
registration timer with a value of 600 seconds if the value received from the
S‑CCF was for greater than 1200 seconds, or to half of the time
otherwise.]{.underline}
NOTE 1: The selected value should be smaller than twice the value of the NAT
timeout for the transport protocol. For UDP, many NATs have a timeout as low
as 30 seconds. Issues such as battery consumption might motivate longer NAT
timeout values. .
NOTE 2: If outbound keep alive messages (See annex K) are received before the
REGISTER message, this procedure is not required,
##### Annex G {#annex-g .H6}
Annex G applies with the exception that all occurrences of \"IMS Access
Gateway\" and IMS Access Gateway over the Iq interface\" are replaced with
\"transport functions\".
##### Annex J CPC parameter definition {#annex-j-cpc-parameter-definition .H6}
##### J.1 Introduction {#j.1-introduction .H6}
This annex defines the use of the \"CPC\" URI parameter for use within SIP URI
and Tel URI [in the P-Asserted ID in the initial INVITE.]{.underline}
Editor\'s note: This annex is based on draft-mahy-iptel-cpc-04.txt and can be
removed when the internet draft becomes an RFC and the usage of the CPC is
allowed for SIP URI. If this solution does not become an RFC, this parameter
will be documented in the present document.
The Calling Party\'s Category is represented as a tel URI [or SIP
URI]{.underline} parameter [in a SIP request]{.underline}. The ABNF syntax is
as follows:
cpc = cpc-tag \"=\" cpc-value\ cpc-tag = \"cpc\"\ cpc-value\ = \"ordinary\" /
\"test\" / \"operator\" /
\"payphone\" [/ \"priority\" / \"data\" /]{.underline}
[\"cellular\" / \"cellular-roaming\" / "ieps"]{.underline} / \"unknown\" /\ \
genvalue\ genvalue = 1*(alphanum / \"-\" / \".\" )
The Accept- Language header shall be used to express the language of the
operator.
The semantics of these Calling Party\'s Category values are described below:
**ordinary:** The caller has been identified, and has no special features.
**test:** This is a test call that has been originated as part of a
maintenance procedure.
**operator:** The call was generated by an operator position.
**payphone:** The calling station is a payphone.
[**priority:** Calling subscriber with priority.]{.underline}
[**data:** Data call (voice band data).]{.underline}
[**cellular** : The calling station is a radio-telephone operating in its home
network.]{.underline}
[**cellular** -**roaming** : The calling station is a radio-telephone roaming
in another network]{.underline}
[**ieps** : This call is an ieps call]{.underline}
**unknown:** The CPC could not be ascertained.
NOTE 1: The choice of CPC values and their use are up to the Service Provider.
CPC values can be exchanged across networks if specified in a bilateral
agreement between the service providers.
NOTE 2: Additional national/regional CPC values may exist (e.g. prison,
police, hotel, hospital, ...)
##### J.2 Trust domain {#j.2-trust-domain .H6}
Entities in the IM CN subsystem shall restrict CPC tel URI or SIP URI
parameter to specific domains that are trusted and support the CPC parameter.
Therefore for the purpose of the CPC parameter within this specification, a
trust domain also applies. This trust domain is identical to that of the
P-Asserted-Identity. [If the communication is to be passed to an untrusted
network or a network not supporting the CPC the CPC parameter shall be
removed.]{.underline}
SIP functional entities within the trust domain will need to take action on
the removal of the CPC parameter when the SIP signalling crosses the boundary
of the trust domain.
##### [J.9A Procedures at the S‑CCF at the terminating network]{.underline}
{#j.9a-procedures-at-the-sccf-at-the-terminating-network .H6}
[The S‑CCF at the terminating network shall delete any CPC parameter in each
initial request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction in the
tel URI or SIP URI of the P-Asserted-Identity before forwarding the request to
the terminating user.]{.underline}
Add annex L
##### [Annex L (normative): SIP Digest]{.underline} {#annex-l-normative-sip-

documented as shown here in annex-L, or will be organized in some other manner
within this specification (for example, integrated with the procedures in the
main body of this specification). Therefore, this annex can be regarded as a
temporary place-holder for this material.]{.underline}
##### [L.1 Scope]{.underline} {#l.1-scope .H6}
[This annex describes the procedures to support SIP digest as an additional
authentication mechanism, and to support TLS as an additional signalling
security mechanism between the UE and P‑CSCF. SIP digest is optional to
implement. When SIP digest is supported, TLS can be used as an optional

###### ## Annex ZB (informative): Procedures
For providing services and PSTN/ISDN interoperability it MUST be possible to
include a Q.850 Cause value in Reason header field of a response.
The Reason Header is defined within RFC 3326 [34A].
###### ## Annex ZC (normative): UUI Header Field
For the purpose of the present document annex ZC is added.
# ZC.1 Introduction
This annex defines the use of the UUI Header Field for use within SIP URI and
Tel URI.
Editor\'s note: This annex is based on draft-johnston-sipping-cc-uui-02.txt
and can be removed when the internet draft becomes an RFC and the usage of the
UUI is allowed for SIP Methods and Responses. If this solution does not become
an RFC, this parameter will be documented in the present document.
The UUI is represented header field parameter in a SIP request or response as
described as follows.
The ABNF syntax is as follows:
The User-to-User header field can be present in INVITE requests and
responses only and in BYE requests and responses.
The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 and extends RFC 3261.
UUI = \"User-to-User\" HCOLON uuidata *(SEMI uui-param)
uuidata = token
uui-param = enc-param \| generic-param
enc-param = \"encoding=\" (\"hex\" \| token)
The only defined parameter for the User-to-User header field is the
encoding parameter. \"encoding=hex\" is used to indicate that the UUI
information is encoded as hex digits. Other encoding methods may
also be standardized.
# ZC.2 Procedures at the terminating network
The UUI Header Field is a transparent field including information sent end to
end. Based on operator policy the UUI header field may be deleted by the S‑CCF
or at the network boundary.
