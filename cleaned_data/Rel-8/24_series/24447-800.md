# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the stage three Protocol Description of the
Advice Of Charge (AOC) service, based on stage 1 and 2 of the ISDN
Supplementary Service Advice Of Charge for all calls (permanent mode). Within
the TISPAN NGN Release 2 Next Generation Network (NGN) the stage 3 description
is specified using the IP Multimedia Call Control Protocol based on Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP).
Three AOC services exist:
**a) Charging information at communication set-up time (AOC-S)**
The AOC-S service enables a user to receive information about the charging
rates at communication set-up time and also to receive further information
during the communication if there is a change of charging rates.
**b) Charging information during the communication (AOC-D)**
The AOC-D service enables a user to receive information on the recorded
charges for a communication during the active phase of the communication.
**c) Charging information at the end of the communication (AOC-E)**
The AOC-E service enables a user to receive information on the recorded
charges for a communication when the communication is terminated.

# 4 Advice Of Charge (AOC)
## 4.1 Introduction
Not applicable.
## 4.2 Description
### 4.2.1 General description
The Advice Of Charge (AOC) service allows the served user to be informed of IP
Multimedia session related charging information.
The AOC service is limited to INVITE-initiated sessions.
The AOC service is not meant to replace the charge metering inside the network
which is considered to be correct in all cases.
The charging information given shall relate to the charges incurred on a
TISPAN NGN.
### 4.2.2 Charging information at communication set-up time (AOC-S)
When the AOC-S service is activated, the network shall provide the user with
information about the charging rates at communication establishment. In
addition, the network shall inform the served user if a change in charging
rates takes place during the communication.
## 4.3 Charging information during the communication (AOC-D)
When the AOC-D service is activated, the network shall provide the user with
charging information for a communication during the active phase of this
communication. The supplied charging information shall be provided as a
cumulative charge incurred so far for the communication (i.e. charges recorded
from the start of the communication and until the moment the charging
information is sent to the served user), or as charging units.
When the call is released, the network shall send the recorded charges for the
communication to the served user.
## 4.4 Charging information at the end of the communication (AOC-E)
When the AOC-E service is activated, the network shall provide the served user
with charging information indicating the recorded charges for a communication
when this communication is released.
## 4.5 Operational requirements
### 4.5.1 Provision/withdrawal
The AOC services shall be provided to the served user after prior arrangement
with the service provider or, as a service provider option, be generally
available. Withdrawal of these services shall be made on the served user\'s
request or for service provider reasons.
When available the AOC services shall be provided for all communications
(permanent mode).
### 4.5.2 Requirements on the originating network side
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
### 4.5.3 Requirements on the terminating network side
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
## 4.6 Coding requirements
The INFO method according to RFC 2976 [4] is needed in support of AOC-D.
The AOC XML schema is defined in annex D. The AOC XML schema shall be
transported as a SIP MIME body. The MIME type for the AOC information is
\"application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\". Any SIP message that transports a body with
AOC information shall identify the payload as MIME type
\"application/vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\".
## 4.7 Signalling requirements
### 4.7.1 Activation/deactivation/registration
Not applicable.
### 4.7.2 Invocation and operation
Basic communication procedures according to ES 283 003 [2] shall apply, with
the following additions.
#### 4.7.2.1 Actions at the served UE
The served UE shall support the INFO method and the AOC XML schema defined in
annex D.
If methods or responses are received which contain AOC information, this
information may be rendered to the user.
#### 4.7.2.2 Actions at the AS of the served user
When sending AOC information, the AS shall encode this information according
to the XML-schema defined in annex D. In addition, for this MIME body the AS
shall set the Content-Type header to \"vnd.etsi.aoc+xml\" and set the Content-
Disposition to \"render\" with the \"handling\" parameter set to \"optional\".
In the case the AOC information is transported in a message that is forwarded
by the AS that contains already a content body, the AS shall generate a
multipart/mixed MIME body containing two sub-parts:
  * one with the AOC information; the Content-Type and Content-Disposition of this sub-part should be coded as specified for non-multipart bodies;
  * one with the received body; headers describing the content of the received SIP message (e.g. Content-type) should be moved into the headers of the this subpart.
In the case the AOC information is transported in a message that is forwarded
by the AS, that contains already a content body and the served user\'s UE has
not indicated support for multipart content, the AS shall forward the message
unchanged.
NOTE: The above clause ensures that a communication setup is not affected in
case a terminal does not support multipart content.
##### 4.7.2.2.1 Actions for AOC-S
###### 4.7.2.2.1.1 Served user is the originating user
When an INVITE request is received, and the served user is subscribed to AOC-S
service, the AS shall either (network operator option) operate as a SIP proxy
as specified in clause 5.7.4 of ES 283 003 [2] and in RFC 3262 [5] and include
the AOC information in the content body of a reliable 1xx provisional
responses, or operate as a routing B2BUA as specified in clause 5.7.5 of ES
283 003 [2] and include the AOC information in the content body a 200 OK
response forwarded by the AS.
If the charging rates change during the communication, the AS shall send the
AOC information to the UE of the served user in the content body of a mid-
dialog request forwarded by the AS or an INFO request generated by the AS.
If no charging information is available, then the AS may, as a network option,
stop the communication establishment before the session is confirmed.
###### 4.7.2.2.1.2 Served user is the terminating user
The AS shall operate as a routing B2BUA as specified in clause 5.7.5 of ES 283
003 [2].
When an INVITE request is received, and the served user is subscribed to the
AOC-S service, the AS shall include the AOC information in the content body in
the INVITE before sending the INVITE to the terminating UE.
If the charging rates change during the communication, the AS shall send the
AOC information to the UE of the served user in the content body of a mid-
dialog request forwarded by the AS or an INFO request generated by the AS.
If no charging information is available, then the AS may, as a network option,
not forward the communication invitation.
##### 4.7.2.2.2 Actions for AOC-D
The AS shall operate as a routing B2BUA as specified in clause 5.7.5 of ES 283
003 [2].
The procedures for AOC-D service at the AS are the same for the originating
and the terminating user.
If the user is subscribed to AOC-D service, the AS may provide charging
information to the user at any moment during the active phase of the
communication. When sending the charging information, the AS shall include the
AOC information in the content body of a mid-dialog request or mid-dialog
response forwarded by the AS to the served user or an INFO request to the
served user generated by the AS. The supplied charging information shall be
provided as a cumulative charge incurred so far for the communication (i.e.
charges recorded from the start of the communication until the moment the
charging information is sent to the served user).
When the communication is terminated, the AS shall include the recorded AOC
information for the communication in the content body of either the BYE
request or the final response to the BYE request sent to the served user. If
the communication is free of charge, then the AS shall indicate the charged
amount as zero in the AOC information.
##### 4.7.2.2.3 Actions for AOC-E
The AS shall operate as a SIP proxy as specified in clause 5.7.4 of ES 283 003
[2].
The procedures for AOC-E service at the AS are the same for the originating
and the terminating user.
If the user is subscribed to AOC-E service, when the communication is
terminated the AS shall include the recorded AOC information for the
communication in the content body of either the BYE request or the final
response to the BYE request sent to the served user. If the communication is
free of charge, then the AS shall indicate the charged amount as zero in the
AOC information.
