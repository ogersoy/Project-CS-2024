# 4 Communication Hold (HOLD)
## 4.1 Introduction
Not applicable.

media stream(s) of an established IP multimedia session, and resume the media
stream(s) at a later time.
## 4.3 Operational requirements
### 4.3.1 Provision/withdrawal
The HOLD service that includes announcements shall be provided after prior
arrangement with the service provider.
### 4.3.2 Requirements on the originating network side
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
### 4.3.3 Requirements in the network
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
### 4.3.4 Requirements on the terminating network side
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
## 4.4 Coding requirements
No specific coding requirements are needed.
## 4.5 Signalling requirements
### 4.5.1 Activation/deactivation
The HOLD service is activated at provisioning and deactivated at withdrawal.
Not applicable.
4.5.1A Registration/erasure
The HOLD service requires no registration. Erasure is not applicable.
4.5.1B Interrogation
Interrogation of HOLD is not applicable.
### 4.5.2 Invocation and operation
#### 4.5.2.1 Actions at the invoking UE
In addition to the application of basic call procedures according to ES 283
003 [1] the following procedures shall be applied at the invoking UE in
accordance with RFC 3264 [4].
A UE shall not invoke the HOLD service on a dialog associated with an
emergency call the UE has intitiated.
If individual media streams are affected:
  * for each media stream that shall be held, the invoking UE shall generate a new SDP offer that contains:
```{=html}
``` \- an \"inactive\" SDP attribute if the stream was previously set to
\"recvonly\" media stream; or
  * a \"sendonly\" SDP attribute if the stream was previously set to \"sendrecv\" media stream; or
```{=html}
``` \- for each media stream that shall be resumed, the invoking UE shall
generate a new SDP offer that contains:
```{=html}
``` \- a \"recvonly\" SDP attribute if the stream was previously an inactive
media stream; or
> \- a \"sendrecv\" SDP attribute if the stream was previously a sendonly
> media stream, or the attribute may be omitted, since sendrecv is the
> default.
If all the media streams in the SDP are affected:
  * for the media streams that shall be held, the invoking UE shall generate a session level direction attribute in the SDP that is set to:
```{=html}
``` \- \"inactive\" if the streams were previously set to \"recvonly\" media
streams; or
  * \"sendonly\" if the streams were previously set to \"sendrecv\" media streams; or
```{=html}
``` \- for the media streams that shall be resumed, the invoking UE shall
generate a session level direction attribute in the SDP that is set to:
```{=html}
``` \- \"recvonly\" if the streams were previously inactive media streams; or
> \- \"sendrecv\" if the streams were previously sendonly media streams, or
> the attribute may be omitted, since sendrecv is the default.
Then the UE shall send the generated SDP offer in a re-INVITE (or UPDATE)
request to the held UE.
#### 4.5.2.2 Actions at the P-CSCF of the invoking UE
Basic communication procedures according to ES 283 003 [1] shall apply.
#### 4.5.2.3 Actions at the S-CSCF
Basic communication procedures according to ES 283 003 [1] shall apply.
#### 4.5.2.4 Actions at the AS of the invoking UE
As a network option the AS of the invoking UE shall initiate the procedures
for the provision of an announcement to the held user in accordance with TS
183 028 [6].
#### 4.5.2.5 Actions at the incoming I-CSCF
Basic communication procedures according to ES 283 003 [1] shall apply.
#### 4.5.2.6 Actions at the outgoing IBCF
Basic communication procedures according to ES 283 003 [1] shall apply.
#### 4.5.2.7 Actions at the incoming IBCF
Basic communication procedures according to ES 283 003 [1] shall apply.
#### 4.5.2.8 Actions at the P-CSCF of the held UE
Basic communication procedures according to ES 283 003 [1] shall apply.
#### 4.5.2.9 Actions at the held UE
Basic communication procedures according to ES 283 003 [1] shall apply.
## 4.6 Interaction with other services
### 4.6.1 Communication Hold (HOLD)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.2 Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.3 Terminating Identification Restriction (TIR)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.4 Originating Identification Presentation (OIP)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.5 Originating identification restriction (OIR)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.6 Conference calling (CONF)
If a participant of a conference invokes the HOLD service, it is not desirable
to provide an announcement to the conference. Therefore if a communication to
a remote URI shall be held by sending a re-INVITE (or UPDATE) request which
includes the \"isfocus\" feature parameter in the Contact header, the AS of
the invoking UE shall not initiate the procedures for the provision of an
announcement to the held user.
### 4.6.7 Communication DIVersion services (CDIV)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.8 Malicious Communication IDentification (MCID)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.9 Anonymous Communication Rejection and Communication Barring (ACR/CB)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.10 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
## 4.7 Interactions with other networks
### 4.7.1 Interaction with PSTN/ISDN
The procedures of ETSI TS 129 163 [3], clause 7.4.10 shall apply with the
additions of ES 283 027 [2].
NOTE: If the Hold and Resume procedures are initiated from the PSTN/ISDN
network side, only the UPDATE request is used to signal the new SDP, in
accordance with **ES 283 003 [1]**.
### 4.7.2 Interaction with PSTN/ISDN Emulation
For Further Study.
### 4.7.3 Interaction with external IP networks
The procedures of **ES 283 003 [1]** shall apply.
## 4.8 Parameter values (timers)
Not applicable.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Signalling Flows
# A.1 HOLD communication
Assumption is that a session has been established between UE-A and UE-B using
basic communication procedures according to ES 283 003 [1], therefore the
following signalling flows do not apply to the initial INVITE.
## A.1.1 HOLD communication without announcement
The following diagram shows a communication session put on hold using a
reINVITE request, note that the same can be achieved by sending an UPDATE
request.
Figure A.1.1.1: HOLD communication without announcement to the held user
1\. UE-A sends an INVITE to UE-B to hold the session. Hold is done by changing
the SDP attribute:
  * \"a=sendonly\", if the stream was previously a sendrecv media stream;
  * \"a=inactive\", if the stream was previously a recvonly media stream.
## A.1.2 HOLD communication with announcement
The following diagram shows a communication session put on hold using a
reINVITE request, note that the same can be achieved by sending an UPDATE
request.
Figure A.1.2.1: HOLD communication with announcement to the held user
1\. UE-A sends an INVITE to UE-B to hold the session. Hold is done by changing
the SDP attribute:
  * \"a=sendonly\", if the stream was previously a sendrecv media stream;
  * \"a=inactive\", if the stream was previously a recvonly media stream.
# A.2 RESUME Communication
## A.2.1 RESUME communication without announcement
The following diagram shows how a communication session is resumed using a
reINVITE request, note that the same can be achieved by sending an UPDATE
request.
Figure A.2.1.1: RESUME communication without announcement to the held user
1\. UE-A sends an INVITE to UE-B to resume the session. Resume is done by
changing the SDP attribute:
  * \"a=sendrecv\", if the stream was previously a recvonly media stream, or the attribute may be omitted, since sendrecv is the default;
  * \"a=recvonly\", if the stream was previously an inactive media stream.
## A.2.2 RESUME communication with announcement
The following diagram shows how a communication session is resumed using a
reINVITE request, note that the same can be achieved by sending an UPDATE
request.
Figure A.2.2.1: RESUME communication with announcement to the held user
1\. UE-A sends an INVITE to UE-B to resume the session. Resume is done by
changing the SDP attribute:
  * \"a=sendrecv\", if the stream was previously a recvonly media stream, or the attribute may be omitted, since sendrecv is the default;
  * \"a=recvonly\", if the stream was previously an inactive media stream.
