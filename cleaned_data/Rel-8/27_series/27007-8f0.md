# Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies a profile of AT commands and recommends that
this profile be used for controlling Mobile Termination (MT) functions and
GSM/UMTS network services from a Terminal Equipment (TE) through Terminal
Adaptor (TA). The command prefix +C is reserved for Digital Cellular in ITU‑T
Recommendation V.250 [14]. The present document has also the syntax details
used to construct these extended GSM/UMTS commands. Commands from ITU‑T
Recommendation V.250 [14] and existing digital cellular standards (TIA IS‑99
[15] and TIA IS‑135 [16]) are used whenever applicable. Some of the new
commands are defined such way that they can be easily applied to MT of
networks other than GSM/UMTS. ITU‑T T.31 [11] and T.32 [12] fax AT commands
may be used for GSM/UMTS fax transmission from TE. GSM/UMTS Short Message
Service AT commands are defined in 3GPP TS 27.005 [24]. GPRS AT commands are
defined in clause 10 of this specification. The present document assumes an
abstract architecture comprising a TE (e.g. a computer) and a MT interfaced by
a TA (see figure 1). The span of control of the defined commands should allow
to handle any physical implementation that this abstract architecture may lead
to:
‑ TA, MT and TE as three separate entities;
‑ TA integrated under the MT cover, and the TE implemented as a separate
entity;
‑ TA integrated under the TE cover, and the MT implemented as a separate
entity;
‑ TA and MT integrated under the TE cover as a single entity.
The commands described in the present document may be observed on the link
between the TE and the TA. However, most of the commands retrieve information
about the MT, not about the TA.
{width="4.8in" height="1.6416666666666666in"}
Figure 1: Setup
Interface between TE and TA is intended to operate over existing serial (ITU‑T
Recommendation V.24) cables, infrared link, and all link types with similar
behaviour. For correct operation many of the defined commands require eight
bit data and therefore it is recommended that TE‑TA link is set to eight bits/
byte mode. (For infrared operation implementation refer informative references
IrDA. For embedding AT commands and data during on-line data state refer
TIA‑617/ITU-T V.80.) Interface between TA and MT is dependent on the interface
in the MT.
The functional blocks shown in Figure 1, using AT commands, shall follow the
principles described in the interactions handling framework 3GPP TS 23.227
[63].

# 4 AT command syntax
## 4.0 General
This clause summarizes general aspects on AT commands and issues related to
them.
TE software implementors must take account that future versions of this
specification may include additional parameters beyond what is expected in any
response to an AT Set Command, Read Command, Test Command, or unsolicited
result code. Implementations must therefore analyse all parameters provided
from the TA and discard (ignore) any parameters received following the
parameters expected by the TE software.
For further information refer ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14].
## 4.1 Command line
See figure 2 for general structure of a command line. Standardized _basic_
commands are found only in V.250 [14]. GSM/UMTS commands use syntax rules of
_extended_ commands. Every extended command has a _test command\ * (trailing
=?) to test the existence of the command and to give information about the
type of its subparameters._ Parameter type _commands also have a_ read command
_(trailing ?) to check the current values of subparameters._ Action type*
commands do not store the values of any of their possible subparameters, and
therefore do not have a read command.
Figure 2: Basic structure of a command line
If verbose responses are enabled with command V1 and all commands in a command
line has been performed successfully, result code \\OK\\ is
sent from the TA to the TE. If numeric responses are enabled with command V0,
result code 0\ is sent instead.
If verbose responses are enabled with command V1 and subparameter values of a
command are not accepted by the TA (or command itself is invalid, or command
cannot be performed for some reason), result code \\ERROR\\ is
sent to the TE and no subsequent commands in the command line are processed.
If numeric responses are enabled with command V0, result code 4\ is sent
instead. ERROR (or 4) response may be replaced by +CME ERROR: \ (refer
clause 9) when command was not processed due to an error related to MT
operation.
## 4.2 Information responses and result codes
The TA response for the example command line of figure 2 could be as shown in
figure 3. Here, verbose response format is enabled with command V1. If numeric
format V0 would have been used, \\ headers of _information response_ s
would have been left out and _final result code_ changed to 0\.
Figure 3: Response to a command line
So called _intermediate result code_ s inform about progress of TA operation
(e.g. connection establishment CONNECT), and so called _unsolicited result
code_ s indicate occurrence of an event not directly associated with issuance
of a command from TE (e.g. ring indication RING).
## 4.3 ITU‑T V.250 [14] TE‑TA interface commands
Table 1 summarizes V.250 [14] commands relating to command line and response
formatting, and TA‑TE interface operation. All are applicable to GSM/UMTS

# 5 General commands
## 5.0 General
ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] includes \"Generic DCE Control\" commands with
the prefix +G. These commands are for the identification of the TA. Four of
those commands are adapted here to be the identification commands of the MT.
Syntax is otherwise similar but the prefix is +CG. TIA IS‑99 [15] uses same
commands for base station identification.

Command Possible response(s) +CSCS=[\]  
+CSCS? +CSCS: \ +CSCS=? +CSCS: (list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
Set command informs TA which character set \ is used by the TE. TA is
then able to convert character strings correctly between TE and MT character
sets.
When TA‑TE interface is set to 8‑bit operation and used TE alphabet is 7‑bit,
the highest bit shall be set to zero.
NOTE: It is manufacturer specific how the internal alphabet of MT is converted
to/from the TE alphabet.
Read command shows current setting and test command displays conversion
schemes implemented in the TA.
Defined values
\ (conversion schemes not listed here can be defined by manufacturers):
\"GSM\" GSM 7 bit default alphabet (3GPP TS 23.038 [25]); this setting causes
easily software flow control (XON/XOFF) problems.
\"HEX\" Character strings consist only of hexadecimal numbers from 00 to FF;
e.g. \"032FE6\" equals three 8-bit characters with decimal values 3, 47 and
230; no conversions to the original MT character set shall be done.
If MT is using GSM 7 bit default alphabet, its characters shall be padded with
8th bit (zero) before converting them to hexadecimal numbers (i.e. no
SMS‑style packing of 7‑bit alphabet).
[\"IRA\"]{.underline} International reference alphabet (see ITU‑T T.50 [13]).
\"PCCP _xxx_ \" PC character set Code Page _xxx_
\"PCDN\" PC Danish/Norwegian character set
\"UCS2\" 16-bit universal multiple-octet coded character set (see ISO/IEC10646
[32]); UCS2 character strings are converted to hexadecimal numbers from 0000
to FFFF; e.g. \"004100620063\" equals three 16-bit characters with decimal
values 65, 98 and 99.
\"UTF-8\" Octet (8-bit) lossless encoding of UCS characters (see RFC 3629
[69]); UTF-8 encodes each UCS character as a variable number of octets, where
the number of octets depends on the integer value assigned to the UCS
character. The input format shall be a stream of octets. It shall not be
converted to hexadecimal numbers as in \"HEX\" or \"UCS2\". This character set
requires an 8-bit TA -- TE interface.
\"8859-_n_ \" ISO 8859 Latin _n_ (1‑6) character set
\"8859-C\" ISO 8859 Latin/Cyrillic character set
\"8859-A\" ISO 8859 Latin/Arabic character set
\"8859-G\" ISO 8859 Latin/Greek character set
\"8859-H\" ISO 8859 Latin/Hebrew character set
**Implementation**
Mandatory when a command using the setting of this command is implemented.

**Description**
This command is used to enable/disable the 3GPP TS 27.010 [45] multiplexing
protocol control channel. Refer to subclause 9.2 for possible \ values.
The AT command sets parameters for the Control Channel. If the parameters are
left out, the default value is used.
Read command returns the current mode and the settings.
Test command returns the supported modes and parameters.
It is recommended that the MT/TA/TE should autobaud to the +CMUX command up to
and including an interface speed of 9600 bits/s.
The OK or +CME ERROR: \ response is returned at the speed of the +CMUX
command prior to entering \.
It is recommended that whenever the multiplexer control channel is released
the MT/TA/TE should assume an interface rate of up to and including 9600
bits/s for auto bauding purposes irrespective of any previous higher speed
having been selected.
If a +CMUX command is issued whilst in any multiplexer mode then that +CMUX
command shall be ignored and the MT/TA shall return an +CME ERROR: \
response.

## 5.10 Informative examples
When beginning to build a communication link, a general TE application
controlling a TA needs to determine the TA and the MT to which it is
connected. V.250 [14] has seven commands for TA identification from which four
are mandatory to be implemented in a TA. An example of this command sequence
requesting manufacturer (+GMI), model (+GMM), revision (+GMR) and serial
number (+GSN) information would be:
AT+GMI
Manufacturer ABC
OK
AT+GMM
GSM Ultimate Data Device
OK
AT+GMR
1.00
OK
AT+GSN
987612345‑123
OK
The maximum lengths of the information responses are defined to be 2048
characters, but it is recommended that they are kept as simple as in the
example. The serial number command is defined as optional. Another optional
command is Global Object Identification command (+GOI) which should return the
object identifiers of ITU‑T Recommendation X.208 as numeric strings delimited
by periods. The Complete Capabilities List command (+GCAP) should indicate the
major capability areas of the TA. The support of different areas is presented
in the response of +GCAP command. Each area may be presented by the selection
command name of a specific capability area (e.g. +FCLASS for fax support) or
some other predefined response. For instance, a GSM TA with fax capabilities
could respond as follows:
AT+GCAP
+GCAP: +CGSM,+FCLASS,+W
OK
The first supported area in the response is presented with +CGSM. It is the
response text to show that some or all GSM commands of the present document
are supported. Second response text (+FCLASS) informs that some fax or voice
capabilities are present, and the third text (+W) about the presence of
wireless commands as specified by PCCA STD‑101 [17]. Command +FCLASS=? (refer
e.g. ITU‑T T.31 [11] and ITU‑T T.32 [12]) should be used to query the
supported fax capabilities and +WS46=? to query the wireless data services
available:
AT+FCLASS=?;+WS46=?
0,1,2,2.0
(12)
OK
The TA of this example supports GSM data services, and fax service class 1
(TIA‑578‑A), 2 (manufacturer specific) and 2.0 (ITU‑T T.32 [12]/ TIA‑592).
The present document defines commands for MT identification which are similar
to those for TA identification in V.250 [14], for an example:
AT+CGMI
Mobile Manufacturer XYZ
OK
AT+CGMM
GSM Phone 1234
OK
AT+CGMR
1.00
OK
AT+CGSN
123456121234561
OK
Manufacturer, model and version commands work similarly as for TA, except that
the serial number query returns the International Mobile Station Equipment
Identity (IMEI) number. IMEI is fifteen digits long and consists of a type
approval code, a final assembly code, a serial number and a spare digit (refer
3GPP TS 23.003 [7]). When the TA is implemented inside MT, the responses for
both TA and MT queries will most likely follow the responses of MT
identification.
# 6 Call control commands and methods
## 6.0 General
This clause describes the control of GSM/UMTS calls. Normal data and fax call
control is done as in ITU‑T Recommendations V.250 [14], T.31 [11] and T.32
[12]. For voice call originating, refer subclause \"ITU‑T V.250 dial command
D\".
## 6.1 Select type of address +CSTA
Table 11: +CSTA parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CSTA=[\]  
+CSTA? +CSTA: \ +CSTA=? +CSTA: (list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
Set command selects the type of number for further dialling commands (D)
according to GSM/UMTS specifications. Test command returns values supported a
compound value.
**Defined values**
\: type of address octet in integer format (refer 3GPP TS 24.008 [8]
subclause 10.5.4.7); default 145 when dialling string includes international
access code character \"+\", otherwise 129
**Implementation**
Mandatory when other than default value allowed.
## 6.2 ITU‑T V.250 [14] dial command D
V.250 [14] dial command D lists characters that may be used in a dialling
string for making a call or controlling supplementary services in accordance
with 3GPP TS 22.030 [19]. Their use in GSM/UMTS is listed in this subclause,
as well as new dial modifiers applicable only to GSM/UMTS are introduced. For
a MT supporting AT commands only, it is mandatory to support the control of
supplementary services in accordance with 3GPP TS 22.030 [19] through the dial
command or through the specific supplementary service commands (+CCFC, +CLCK,
etc.), where 3GPP TS 22.030 [19] identifies the supplementary services as
mandatory.
**V.250 dialling digits**
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 * # + A B C (implementation of these characters is
mandatory for GSM/UMTS)
D (implementation of this character is optional for GSM/UMTS, and it is
ignored)
**V.250 modifier characters**
, (implementation of this character is mandatory for GSM/UMTS, but it may be
ignored)
T P (implementation of these characters is mandatory for GSM/UMTS, but they
are ignored)
! W @ (implementation of these characters is optional for GSM/UMTS, and they
are ignored)
**V.250 semicolon character**
In GSM/UMTS, when semicolon character is given after dialling digits (or
modifiers), a voice call originated to the given address. TA returns to
command state immediately (or after possible +COLP result code; refer
subclause \"Connected line identification presentation +COLP\"). Refer Annex G
for a detailed example.
**GSM/UMTS modifier characters**
> (refer subclause \"Direct dialling from phonebooks\")
I or i (override the CLIR supplementary service subscription default value for
this call; I = invocation (restrict CLI presentation) and i = suppression
(allow CLI presentation); refer subclause \"Calling line identification
restriction +CLIR\")
G or g (control the CUG supplementary service information for this call; uses
index and info values set with command +CCUG; refer subclause \"Closed user
group +CCUG\")
## 6.3 Direct dialling from phonebooks
GSM/UMTS MT and SIM/UICC can contain phonebooks which have a phone number and
an alphanumeric field for each phonebook entry location. The use of V.250 [14]
dialling command ensures that direct dialling from MT and SIM/UICC phonebook
is possible through ordinary communications software which just gives the
phone number field to be filled and then use the D command to originate the
call. Available memories may be queried with Select Phonebook Storage test
command +CPBS=?, and location range for example with Read Phonebook Entries
test command +CPBR=?.
**Execute commands**
1\. D>\[I][G][;] originate call to phone number which corresponding
alphanumeric field is \ (if possible, all available memories should be
searched for the correct entry).
2\. D>_mem_ \[I][G][;] originate call to phone number in memory _mem_ entry
location \ (available memories may be queried with Select Phonebook Storage
test command +CPBS=?; _mem_ could be e.g. ME).
3\. D>\[I][G][;] originate call to phone number in entry location \ (it
is manufacturer specific which memory storage of MT, SIM/UICC and TA is used;
command Select Phonebook Memory Storage +CPBS setting is recommended to be
used).
Semicolon character shall be added when voice call is originated. CLIR and CUG
per call base modifiers may also be present.
**Responses**
Possible error responses include +CME ERROR: \ when error is related to
MT functionality. Refer subclause 9.2 for possible error values. Otherwise TA
responses can have values defined by V.250 [14] and commands Service Reporting
Control +CR and Connected Line Identification Presentation +COLP. Detailed
error report of an unsuccessful originated call failed in a GSM/UMTS network
error can be obtained with command Extended Error Report +CEER (if
implemented).
**Defined values**
\: string type value, which should equal to an alphanumeric field in at
least one phonebook entry in the searched memories; used character set should
be the one selected with Select TE Character Set +CSCS
\: integer type memory location should be in the range of locations
available in the memory used
**Implementation**
Mandatory when direct dialling is implemented. Also phonebook commands
implementation is required.
## 6.4 Call mode +CMOD
Table 12: +CMOD parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CMOD=[\]  
+CMOD? +CMOD: \ +CMOD=? +CMOD: (list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
Set command selects the call mode of further dialling commands (D) or for next
answering command (A). Mode can be either single or alternating (in the
present document, terms \"alternating mode\" and \"alternating call\" refer to
all GSM/UMTS bearer and teleservices that incorporate more than one basic
service (voice, data, fax) within one call). When single mode is selected the
call originating and hangup procedures are similar to procedures specified in
ITU‑T Recommendations V.250 [14], T.31 [11] and T.32 [12]. In GSM/UMTS there
can be voice followed by data (refer 3GPP TS 22.002 [1]), alternating
voice/data (refer 3GPP TS 22.002 [1]) and alternating voice/fax calls (refer
3GPP TS 22.003 [2]). Refer next two subclauses for alternating call control
methods.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
NOTE: +CMOD shall be set to zero after a successfully completed alternating
mode call. It shall be set to zero also after a failed answering. The
power‑up, factory (&F) and user resets (Z) shall also set the value to zero.
This reduces the possibility that alternating mode calls are originated or
answered accidentally.
**Defined values**
\:
[0]{.underline} single mode
1 alternating voice/fax (teleservice 61)
2 alternating voice/data (bearer service 61)
3 voice followed by data (bearer service 81)
also all other values below 128 are reserved by the present document
**Implementation**
Mandatory when alternating mode calls are implemented in the TA.
## 6.4A Voice Call Mode +CVMOD

* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CVMOD=[\]  
+CVMOD? +CVMOD: _\ _ +CVMOD=? +CMOD: (list of supported
\s)
* * *
**Description**
Set command selects the voice call mode for making a Mobile Originated voice
call from the UE. The voice call mode can be CS_ONLY, VOIP_ONLY, CS_PREFERRED
or VOIP_PREFERRED. The default mode is CS_ONLY. Type of VoIP session preferred
(e.g. SIP VoIP, IMS VoIP) is manufacturer specific issue.
NOTE 1:
\- If the Call Mode is set to CS_ONLY, then the ATD command will make a call
in CS mode.
\- If the Call Mode is set to VOIP_ONLY, then the ATD command will make a call
in VoIP mode.
\- If the Call Mode is set to CS_PREFERRED, then the ATD command gives
preference for CS based voice call.
\- If the Call Mode is set to VOIP_PREFERRED, then the ATD command gives
preference for VoIP based voice call
NOTE 2: The preferences are not applicable for the emergency call.
NOTE 3: The preferences are not applicable if operator has set preferences for
UE originated calls/sessions, 3GPP TS 24.216 [75] subclause 5.6.
Test command returns the values supported by the UE.
**Defined values**
0 CS_ONLY
1 VOIP_ONLY
2 CS_PREFERRED
3 VOIP_PREFERRED
**Implementation**
Optional.
## 6.5 Hangup call +CHUP
Table 13: +CHUP action command syntax
* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CHUP  
+CHUP=?
* * *
**Description**
Execution command causes the TA to hangup the current GSM/UMTS call of the MT.
NOTE: The purpose of this command is not to replace the V.250 [14] command H,
but to give an assured procedure to terminate an alternating mode call. Refer
next subclause.
**Implementation**
Mandatory when alternating mode calls implemented in the TA.
## 6.6 Alternating mode call control method
This subclause describes the procedure to handle alternating mode calls with
AT commands. Procedures are mandatory when alternating mode calls are
implemented in the TA.
NOTE: ATH and drop DTR will not necessarily cause a hangup from voice mode. If
the +CVHU is implemented the behaviour shall be controlled by its setting.
**Voice followed by data call (bearer service 81)**
Figure 4 shows commands to start the call, to switch from voice to data
(In‑Call Modification) and to hang up the call. +CMOD and +FCLASS commands
indicate the current settings before dialling or answering command, not that
they shall be given just before D or A command. Refer subclause \"Cellular
result codes +CRC\" for possible +CRING result code values. Refer Annex F for
a detailed example.
Figure 4: Voice followed by data call
**Voice/ data call (bearer service number 61)**
Figure 5 shows the commands to start the call, to switch between modes

**Description**
Radio link protocol (RLP) parameters used when non-transparent data calls are
originated may be altered with set command. Available command subparameters
depend on the RLP versions implemented by the device (e.g. \ may not be
available if device supports only versions 0 and 1).
NOTE 1: If radio link protocol is not used, but some other error correcting
protocol (for transparent data calls), V.250 [14] Error Control Selection test
command +ES=? may be used to indicate the presence of the protocol.
Read command returns current settings for each supported RLP version \. Only RLP parameters applicable to the corresponding \ are
returned.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value. If MT/TA supports
several RLP versions \, the RLP parameter value ranges for each
\ are returned in a separate line.
**Defined values**
\, \: RLP version number in integer format; when version
indication is not present it shall equal 0
NOTE 2: Versions 0 and 1 share the same parameter set. Read and test commands
shall return only one line for this set (where \ is not present).
\, \, \, \, \: IWF to MS window size, MS to IWF window
size, acknowledgement timer T1, retransmission attempts N2, re-sequencing
period T4 in integer format (default values and value ranges depend on RLP
version; refer 3GPP TS 24.022 [18]): T1 and T4 are in units of 10 ms.
**Implementation**

returned from the TA to the TE. If enabled, the intermediate result code is
transmitted at the point during connect negotiation at which the TA has
determined which speed and quality of service will be used, before any error
control or data compression reports are transmitted, and before the
intermediate result code CONNECT is transmitted.
NOTE: This command replaces V.250 [14] command Modulation Reporting Control
+MR, which is not appropriate for use in the GSM/UMTS network. Possible error
control (other than radio link protocol) and data compression reporting can be
enabled with V.250 commands Error Control Reporting +ER and Data Compression
Reporting +DR.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
**Defined values**
\:
[0]{.underline} disables reporting
1 enables reporting
\:
ASYNC asynchronous transparent
SYNC synchronous transparent
REL ASYNC asynchronous non‑transparent

**Description**
Enabled command returns intermediate result code +CHSR: \ from the TA to
the TE when an HSCSD call is being set up. The result code represents the
current (negotiated or renegotiated) HSCSD parameters. If enabled, the
intermediate result code is transmitted at the point of the call setup
negotiation where the TA has determined what type of an HSCSD connection will
be used. Result code transmission is done after possible service (+CR), error
control (+ER), and/or compression (+DR) reporting but before possible TE-TA
rate (+ILRR) reporting and before the intermediate result code CONNECT is
transmitted. The format of the intermediate result code is:
+CHSR: \,\,\,\
For the value definitions, refer to +CHSN and +CHSC commands. For instance,
for a non-transparent HSCSD call, result code \'+CHSR: 2,2,4,8\' means that
the call has two timeslots in both up- and downlink, the air interface user
rate is 28800 bps, and the used channel coding TCH/F14.4.

## 6.28 Informative examples
The alternating mode call handling (voice and fax, or voice and data) and the
data call setup commands are defined such that the dialling command of V.250
[14] (D) still always originates a call. The purpose is to support all current
TE applications using the dialling command as default. Fax calls are
controlled following the rules of ITU‑T T.31 [11] and ITU‑T T.32 [12]
standards.
An example where a voice call is originated:
ATD+1 812 555673I; (type of address defaults to 145, CLI presentation is
restricted for this call)
OK (call setup was successful)
An example where a voice call is attempted from a phonebook:
ATD>\"Doe Joe\"G; (enable CUG control for this call)
+CME ERROR: 22 (entry \"Doe Joe\" is not found)
Also supplementary services may be controlled using dial command according to
3GPP TS 22.030 [19]. An example of call forwarding on no reply for telephony
with the adjustment of the no reply condition timer on 25 seconds:
ATD**61*+1812555673*11*25#
OK (modification was successful)
Two new commands are created for controlling the alternating mode calls. First
one, Call Mode (+CMOD), selects between single and alternating mode. Because
this is a crucial command, it is defined that the value is set back to zero
(single mode) after every successfully originated alternating mode call. Also
on power‑up and factory or user resets, the value is set to zero. The second
new command, Hangup Call (+CHUP), is not a replacement of V.250 [14] command
H, but a command which reliably disconnects the call in GSM/UMTS network. This
is defined because the H command is used to switch from fax or data mode to
voice mode.
The setting of GSM/UMTS bearer service (data circuit duplex asynchronous and
synchronous, PAD access circuit asynchronous, or data packet duplex
synchronous), is done with Select Bearer Service Type (+CBST). It chooses one
of the four mentioned bearer services, the data rate of the service (or
actually the modulation when modem IWFs are used), and enables or disables
RLP. Command Radio Link Protocol (+CRLP) is used to set the RLP parameters in
the radio path.
Service Reporting Control command (+CR) is defined similarly as the reporting
of modulation, V.18, error control, and data compression which are V.250 [14]
features used to show information about the type of the established connection
before the CONNECT intermediate result code. +CR command has one subparameter
which specifies whether the intermediate result code +CR: \ is returned
or not. The result code should be returned before any V.250 [14] reporting
result codes. An example of setting up an asynchronous 9600 bit/s modem
connection with service reporting:
AT+CBST=7,0,1 (asynchronous modem 9600 bit/s and RLP)
OK
AT+CR=1 (enable reporting)
OK
ATD1234567890
+CR: REL ASYNC
CONNECT 9600
As GSM/UMTS network offers more information about the reason of the failure in
call originating and answering than normal PSTN, it is useful to add an extra
command to return this information to the TE. This information should not be
returned always after unsuccessful call originating or answering, because many
TE applications look for just the regular NO CARRIER, BUSY, NO ANSWER and
CONNECT messages. Action command Extended Error Report (+CEER) does not have
any subparameters, and it returns the cause of the latest call setup failure.
This information may be the textual presentation of the GSM/UMTS network
failure code (refer 3GPP TS 24.008 [8] Annex H), or some other information
defined by the TA manufacturer.

**Description**
Set command forces an attempt to select and register the GSM/UMTS network
operator. \ is used to select whether the selection is done
automatically by the MT or is forced by this command to operator \ (it
shall be given in format \) to a certain access technology, indicated
in \. If the selected operator is not available, no other operator shall
be selected (except \=4). If the selected access technology is not
available, then the same operator shall be selected in other access
technology. The selected operator name format shall apply to further read
commands (+COPS?) also. \=2 forces an attempt to deregister from the
network. The selected mode affects to all further network registration (e.g.
after \=2, MT shall be unregistered until \=0 or 1 is selected).
Refer subclause 9.2 for possible \ values. This command should be
abortable when registration/deregistration attempt is made.
Read command returns the current mode, the currently selected operator and the
current Access Technology. If no operator is selected, \, \ and
\ are omitted.
Test command returns a set of five parameters, each representing an operator
present in the network. A set consists of an integer indicating the
availability of the operator \, long and short alphanumeric format of
the name of the operator, numeric format representation of the operator and
access technology. Any of the formats may be unavailable and should then be an
empty field. The list of operators shall be in order: home network, networks
referenced in SIM or active application in the UICC (GSM or USIM) in the
following order: HPLMN selector, User controlled PLMN selector, Operator
controlled PLMN selector and PLMN selector (in the SIM or GSM application),
and other networks.
It is recommended (although optional) that after the operator list TA returns
lists of supported \s and \s. These lists shall be delimited
from the operator list by two commas.
The access technology selected parameters, \, should only be used in
terminals capable to register to more than one access technology. Selection of
\ does not limit the capability to cell reselections, even though an
attempt is made to select an access technology, the phone may still re-select
a cell in another access technology.

**Description**
This command allows the control of the following call related services:
\- a call can be temporarily disconnected from the MT but the connection is
retained by the network;
\- multiparty conversation (conference calls);
\- the served subscriber who has two calls (one held and the other either
active or alerting) can connect the other parties and release the served
subscriber\'s own connection.
Calls can be put on hold, recovered, released, added to conversation, and
transferred similarly as defined in 3GPP TS 22.030 [19]. Refer subclause 9.2
for possible \ values.
This is based on the GSM/UMTS supplementary services HOLD (Call Hold; refer
3GPP TS 22.083 [5] clause 2), MPTY (MultiParty; refer 3GPP TS 22.084 [22]) and
ECT (Explicit Call Transfer; refer 3GPP TS 22.091 [29]). The interaction of
this command with other commands based on other GSM/UMTS supplementary
services is described in the GSM/UMTS standards.
NOTE: Call Hold, MultiParty and Explicit Call Transfer are only applicable to
teleservice 11.

**Description**
This command allows control of the Unstuctured Supplementary Service Data
(USSD) according to 3GPP TS 22.090 [23]. Both network and mobile initiated
operations are supported. Parameter \ is used to disable/enable the
presentation of an unsolicited result code (USSD response from the network, or
network initiated operation) +CUSD: \[,\,\] to the TE. In
addition, value \=2 is used to cancel an ongoing USSD session.
When \ is given, a mobile initiated USSD‑string or a response USSD‑string
to a network initiated operation is sent to the network. The response
USSD‑string from the network is returned in a subsequent unsolicited +CUSD
result code.
NOTE: In case of successful mobile initiated operation, TA implemented
according to a version prior to 6 of this standard, waits the USSD response
from the network and sends it to the TE before the final result code. This
will block the AT command interface for the period of the operation. Such TA
does not support \ value 2.
The interaction of this command with other commands based on other GSM/UMTS
supplementary services is described in the GSM/UMTS standards.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.

**Description**
Set command controls the presentation of an unsolicited result code\ +CPSB:
\,\ when \=1 and the \ corresponds to a PDP context
in the PDP-ACTIVE state or to an EPS bearer context and there is a change in
the current bearer due to the reception of a control or signalling message
from the network as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 [71], 3GPP TS 25.331 [74], or
3GPP TS 36.331 [86].
Read command returns the current status of unsolicited result code
presentation \. Also the parameters \, \ are returned for
each defined context only when \=1 and the \ corresponds to a PDP
context in the PDP-ACTIVE state or to an EPS bearer context.
Test command returns the list of supported \s.
**Defined values**
\:
[0]{.underline} disable the presentation of the unsolicited result code
1 enable the presentation of the unsolicited result code\ +CPSB:
\,\
\: A numeric parameter which specifies a particular PDP context or EPS
bearer context definition. The \ parameter is local to the TE-MT
interface and identifies only those PDP or EPS bearer contexts which have been
setup via AT command.
\: The current packet switched bearer which is established
between the UE and network.
0 There is currently no packet switched bearer between the UE and the network
(e.g. RAB is released in UMTS or the TBF is released in GSM). This would mean
that there is no bearer associated to the PDP context referred to by the
\ parameter and hence no data transfer is currently occuring on that
particular PDP context. This result code covers the case where the PDP context
is active but there is no bearer associated with it.
1 GPRS. (See 3GPP TS 44.060 [71] for definition of GPRS TBF Mode)
2 EGPRS. (See 3GPP TS 44.060 [71] for definition of EGPRS TBF Mode)

6 HSUPA in uplink and HSDPA in downlink. (See NOTE 1 to NOTE 4)
7 EPS (See NOTE 5)
NOTE 1: The term \"non-HSDPA\" means a non-HSDPA UMTS bearer. 3GPP TS 25.331
[74] specifies the criterion to be satisfied in order for a downlink UMTS RAB
to be termed as HSDPA. If those criterion are not met, then the downlink UMTS
RAB would be termed as \"non-HSDPA\" by this AT command.
NOTE 2: The term \"non-HSUPA\" means a non-HSUPA UMTS bearer. 3GPP TS 25.331
[74] specifies the criterion to be satisfied in order for an uplink UMTS RAB
to be termed as HSUPA (or Enhanced uplink DCH). If those criterion are not
met, then the uplink UMTS RAB would be termed as \"non-HSUPA\" by this AT
command.
NOTE 3: _The terms \"non-HSDPA\", \"non-HSUPA\" indicate R99 to pre- HSDPA or
pre-HSUPA UMTS bearers. They do not imply GPRS or EGPRS bearers._
NOTE 4: See 3GPP TS 25.308 [72] for HSDPA and 3GPP TS 25.319 [73] for HSUPA.
NOTE 5: The term \"EPS\" means an EPS bearer (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [86]).
**Implementation**
Optional.
## 7.30 Informative examples
This subclause includes all the GSM/UMTS supplementary service related
commands, additional commands to lock MT and SIM/UICC capabilities, and
commands to check the network registration status.
An example where MSISDNs of a MT are queried, calls are forwarded to different
numbers when mobile is busy (CFB) or when it does not answer (CFNRy). The
status of CFNRy is read:
AT+CNUM
+CNUM: ,\"+358501234567\",145,,4 (voice number)
OK
AT+CCFC=1,1,\"931123456\" (enable CFB)
OK
AT+CCFC=2,1,\"921654321\" (enable CFNRy)
OK
AT+CCFC=1,2 (query CFNRy)
+CCFC: 1,7,\"+35821654321\",145,,,20 (forward after 20 seconds)
OK
An example of Call Waiting (+CCWA), Call Related Supplementary Services
(+CHLD), and Connected Line Identification Presentation (+COLP) usage:
AT+CCWA=1,1;+COLP=1 (enable call waiting and COLP result codes)
OK
ATD9311234567; (originate a voice call)
+COLP: \"+358311234567\",145
OK
...conversation...
+CCWA: \"+358317654321\",145 (another call is waiting)
AT+CHLD=2 (put first call on hold and answer the second one)
OK
...conversation...
AT+CHLD=1 (release the second (active) call and recover the first (held) call)
OK
ATH (release the first call)
OK
Call barring supplementary services are combined in one command, Facility Lock
(+CLCK), which is also used to restrict MT and SIM/UICC functionality Some of
the facilities require a password when enabled or disabled. An additional
command, Change Password (+CPWD), is defined for changing the password of
different barring and restriction facilities. An example where locking status
of outgoing international calls is interrogated and then barred, and the
password of the SIM/UICC card lock (Personal Identity Number, PIN) is changed:
AT+CLCK=\"OI\",2
+CLCK: 0,7
OK
AT+CLCK=\"OI\",1,\"1234\"
OK
AT+CPWD=\"SC\",\"4321\",\"1234\"
OK
Operator Selection (+COPS) command is used for querying the status of all
GSM/UMTS operators detected in the area, and switching between operators.
Following example illustrates a network selection sequence in Finland. Two
operators are found, the status of Tele is unknown and Radiolinja is currently
selected. Read command shows that automatic selection mode is on and that
Radiolinja is selected. Then an attempt is made to access Tele, but it is
denied (shown by +CME ERROR).
AT+COPS=?
+COPS: (2,\"RADIOLINJA\",\"RL\",\"24405\"),(0,\"TELE\",\"TELE\",\"24491\")
OK
AT+COPS?
+COPS: 0,0,\"RADIOLINJA\"
OK
AT+COPS=1,0,\"TELE\"
+CME ERROR: 3
When a terminal wanders between countries (i.e. networks), an application may
follow this e.g. with the following scenario:
AT+CREG=1 (enable +CREG: \ unsolicited result code)
OK
AT+CREG?
+CREG: 1,1 (MT is registered in home PLMN)
OK
AT+COPS=3,2;+COPS?;+COPS=3,0;+COPS?
+COPS: 0,2,\"24405\" (get the country...
+COPS: 0,0,\"RADIOLINJA\" ...and operator name)
OK
...user wanders to another PLMN...
+CREG: 2 (deregistered, roaming ongoing)
+CREG: 5 (registered again, not home PLMN)
AT+COPS=3,2;+COPS?;+COPS=3,0;+COPS?
+COPS: 0,2,\"24001\" (get the country...
+COPS: 0,0,\"TELIA MOBITEL\" ...and operator name)
OK
...user loses connection, no other PLMNs around...
+CREG: 0
An example of eMLPP Supplementary Service usage for a ptp voice call:
ATD*752#+436644101453; (originate a voice call with the priority level 2, see
for priority level definitions GSM 02.30)
OK (call setup was successful)
# 8 Mobile Termination control and status commands
## 8.0 General
This clause includes commands for MT power, keypad, touch screen, display and
indicator handling. Also commands for selecting, reading and writing of
phonebooks, and setting real‑time clock facilities are specified. Two commands
are specified for accessing SIM/UICC database records in a general way.
Figure 7 illustrates the effect of these commands. Command Phone Activity
Status +CPAS indicates the current general activity status of the MT. Command
Set Phone Functionality +CFUN is used to set the MT to different power
consumption states. Command Enter PIN +CPIN is used to enter MT passwords
which are needed before any other functionality of the MT can be used (e.g.
SIM PIN, PUK). Commands Generic SIM Access +CSIM and Restricted SIM Access
+CRSM can be used to access all data in SIM/UICC. Commands Battery Charge +CBC
and Signal Quality +CSQ are same as in TIA IS‑135 [16] and they are used to
query the battery charge of the MT and the current RSSI of the MT. Command
Mobile Termination Control Mode +CMEC is used to select the controlling unit
of MT keypad, display touch screen, and indicators. Controlling commands for
the TE are Keypad Emulation +CKPD, Display Control +CDIS, Touch Screen
Emulation +CTSA, and Indicator Control +CIND. If corresponding event reporting
is enabled with command Mobile Termination Event Reporting +CMER, +CKEV is the
result code of a keypad event, +CDEV is the result code of a display event,
+CTEV is the result code of a touch screen event, and +CIEV is the result code
of an indicator event. Phonebook commands are Select Phonebook Memory Storage
+CPBS, Read Phonebook Entries +CPBR, Find Phonebook Entries +CPBF and Write
Phonebook Entry +CPBW. Additional command Clock +CCLK can be used to control
the real‑time clock of the MT if available. Command Alarm +CALA sets possible
alarm clock facilities of the MT.

**Description**
Set command sends to the MT a password which is necessary before it can be
operated (SIM PIN, SIM PUK, PH‑SIM PIN, etc.). If the PIN is to be entered
twice, the TA shall automatically repeat the PIN. If no PIN request is
pending, no action is taken towards MT and an error message, +CME ERROR, is
returned to TE. Refer subclause 9.2 for possible \ values.
NOTE: SIM PIN, SIM PUK, PH-SIM PIN, PH-FSIM PIN, PH-FSIM PUK, SIM PIN2 and SIM
PUK2 refer to the PIN of the selected application on the UICC. For example, in
an UTRAN context, the selected application on a UICC should be a USIM and the
SIM PIN then represents the PIN of the selected USIM. See TS 31.101 [65] for
further details on application selection on the UICC.
If the PIN required is SIM PUK or SIM PUK2, the second pin is required. This
second pin, \, is used to replace the old pin in the SIM.
NOTE: Commands which interact with MT that are accepted when MT is pending SIM
PIN, SIM PUK, or PH‑SIM are: +CGMI, +CGMM, +CGMR, +CGSN, D112; (emergency
call), +CPAS, +CFUN, +CPIN, +CDIS (read and test command only), and +CIND

**Description**
Set command is used to write the contents of MT text type display elements. An
element can consist of one character or several characters. The order of
element parameters \ should follow the rule: first is the element in
upper left corner, second is the next element to the right and so on. The last
element is the element in lower right corner. The number of elements is MT
specific. If MT does not allow writing to its display or MT is not currently
reachable, +CME ERROR: \ is returned. Refer subclause 9.2 for \
values. If certain element is not writable, setting of it should be ignored.
If element parameter is empty field, element shall remain in the previous
value.
NOTE 1: This command cannot be used to write to a display which sum of element
lengths exceed the length of the command line buffer of the TA.
Read command returns the contents of MT display elements. If \ field is
empty (not empty string), MT does not allow the reading of corresponding
element. If MT is not currently reachable, +CME ERROR: \ is returned.
Refer subclause 9.2 for \ values.
Test command returns maximum length of each display element. If MT does not
offer the length of elements, \ fields should be empty. If MT is not
currently reachable, +CME ERROR: \ is returned. Refer subclause 9.2 for
\ values.
NOTE 2: MT manufacturer should offer the order and maximum length of elements.

Description
Set command is used to set the values of MT indicators. \ value 0 means
that the indicator is off (or in state which can be identified as
\"off\"‑state), 1 means that indicator is on (or in a state which is more
substantial than \"off\"‑state), 2 is more substantial than 1, and so on. If

**Description**
Set command transmits to the MT the \ it then shall send as it is to
the SIM. In the same manner the SIM \ shall be sent back by the MT
to the TA as it is. Refer subclause 9.2 for \ values.
This command allows a direct control of the SIM by an distant application on
the TE. The TE shall then take care of processing SIM information within the
frame specified by GSM/UMTS.
NOTE: Compared to Restricted SIM Access command +CRSM, the definition of +CSIM
allows TE to take more control over the SIM‑MT interface. The locking and
unlocking of the interface may be done by a special \ value or
automatically by TA/MT (by interpreting \ parameter). In case that TE
application does not use the unlock command (or does not send a \
causing automatic unlock) in a certain timeout value, MT may release the
locking.
**Defined values**
\ : integer type; length of the characters that are sent to TE in
\ or \ (two times the actual length of the command or
response)
\ : command passed on by the MT to the SIM in the format as described
in GSM 51.011 [28] (hexadecimal character format; refer +CSCS)

**Description**
By using this command instead of Generic SIM Access +CSIM TE application has
easier but more limited access to the SIM database. Set command transmits to
the MT the SIM \ and its required parameters. MT handles internally
all SIM‑MT interface locking and file selection routines. As response to the
command, MT sends the actual SIM information parameters and response data. MT
error result code +CME ERROR may be returned when the command cannot be passed
to the SIM, but failure in the execution of the command in the SIM is reported
in \ and \ parameters. Refer to subclause 9.2 for \ values.
Coordination of command requests to SIM and the ones issued by GSM/UMTS
application inside the MT is implementation dependent. However the TE should
be aware of the precedence of the GSM/UMTS application commands to the TE
commands.

\"7F205F70\" in SIM and UICC case). The \ shall only be used in the
mode \"select by path from MF\" as defined in ETSI TS 102 221 [60].
NOTE 3: Since valid elementary file identifiers may not be unique over all
valid dedicated file identifiers the \ indicates the targeted UICC/SIM
directory path in case of ambiguous file identifiers. For earlier versions of
this specification or if \ is omitted, it could be implementation
specific which one will be selected.
\, \: integer type; information from the SIM about the execution of
the actual command. These parameters are delivered to the TE in both cases, on
successful or failed execution of the command
\: response of a successful completion of the command previously

**Description**
Set command informs TA that TE wants to establish a peer-to-peer protocol
\ or upper layer connection (indicating by the \s setting) with
the MT on the link from which the command was received.\ This command can be
used in case the link between TE and MT does not provide itself such a
mechanism.
If MT has succeeded in establishing a logical link between application
protocols and external interface, it will send CONNECT message to the TE.
Otherwise, the NO CARRIER response will be returned.
If the CONNECT response is received, TE can start sending \ or upper
layer frames.
The connection shall always return for \ mode when the protocol session
is ended. When the MT receives a disconnect request from its peer entity, it
will process it and send OK response to the TE indicating its capability for
receiving new AT commands. Since \ or upper layers can be accessed in
other ways, TA must have pre-knowledge of the fact that connection is
initiated with AT+CPROT command. This means that switch to \ mode must
include some sort of notification to the protocol entity.
This command can be aborted by sending a \ or upper layer disconnection
frame. In that case, MT will return in command mode by sending the OK
response.
Refer subclause 9.2 for possible \ values.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.

## 8.43 Generic UICC Logical Channel access +CGLA
Table 103: +CGLA action command syntax
+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ | Command | Possible response(s) | +--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ | +CGLA=\,\,\ | +CGLA: \,\ | | | | | | _+CME ERROR: \ _ | +--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ | +CGLA=? | | +--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
**Description**
Set command transmits to the MT the \ it then shall send as it is to
the UICC. In the same manner the UICC \ shall be sent back by the MT
to the TA as it is. Refer subclause 9.2 for \ values.
This command allows a direct control of the UICC by a distant application on
the TE. The TE shall then take care of processing UICC information within the
frame specified by GSM/UMTS.
Although Generic UICC Logical Channel Access command +CGLA allows TE to take
control over the UICC‑MT interface, there are some functions of the UICC-MT
interface that logically do not need to be accessed from outside the TA/MT.
Moreover, for security reason the GSM network authentication should not be
handled outside the TA/MT. Therefore it shall not be allowed to execute a Run
GSM Algorithm command or an Authenticate command in GSM context from the TE
using +CGLA at all time whether the +CGLA is locked or unlocked. This shall
not forbid the TE to send Authenticate commands in other security contexts
(e.g. EAP security context).
For example, the TA/MT shall forbid the transfer of the Authenticate command
to a USIM application when parameters P2 = 0 (GSM security context). See TS
31.102 [59] for USIM authenticate command definition.
NOTE: Compared to Restricted UICC Access command +CRLA, the definition of
+CGLA allows TE to take more control over the UICC‑MT interface. The locking
and unlocking of the interface may be done by a special \ value or
automatically by TA/MT (by interpreting \ parameter). In case that TE
application does not use the unlock command (or does not send a \
causing automatic unlock) in a certain timeout value, MT may release the
locking.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; this is the identifier of the session to be used
in order to send the APDU commands to the UICC. It is manadatory in order to
send commands to the UICC when targeting applications on the smart card using
a logical channel other than the default channel (channel \"0\").
\ : integer type; length of the characters that are sent to TE in
\ or \ (two times the actual length of the command or
response)
\ : command passed on by the MT to the UICC in the format as
described in 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] (hexadecimal character format; refer +CSCS)

**Description**
By using this command instead of Generic UICC Access +CGLA TE application has
easier but more limited access to the UICC database. Set command transmits to
the MT the UICC \ and its required parameters. MT handles internally
all UICC‑MT interface locking and file selection routines. As response to the
command, MT sends the actual UICC information parameters and response data. MT
error result code +CME ERROR may be returned when the command cannot be passed
to the UICC, but failure in the execution of the command in the UICC is
reported in \ and \ parameters. Refer to subclause 9.2 for \
values.
Coordination of command requests to UICC and the ones issued by GSM/UMTS
application inside the MT is implementation dependent. However the TE should
be aware of the precedence of the GSM/UMTS application commands to the TE
commands.
**Defined values**

**Description**
Execution of the command causes the MT to return \ to allow the TE
to identify a channel that is being allocated by the UICC, which is attached
to ME. The UICC will open a new logical channel; select the application
identified by the \ received with this command and return a session Id
as the response. The ME shall restrict the communication between the TE and
the UICC to this logical channel.
This \ is to be used when sending commands with Restricted UICC
Logical Channel access +CRLA or Generic UICC Logical Channel access +CGLA
commands.
Note that the logical channel number is contained in the CLASS byte of an APDU
command, thus implicitly contained in all APDU commands sent to a UICC. In
this case it will be up to the MT to manage the logical channel part of the
APDU CLASS byte and to ensure that the chosen logical channel is relevant to
the \ indicated in the AT command. See 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] for

This command allows a TE to exchange EAP packets with the UICC or the ME.
Prior to the execution of this command, the TE shall retrieve the available
AIDs using the +CUAD command. The TE shall select one appropriate AID to be
addressed. Selection may include asking the user, and considering EAP methods
supported by the AIDs. The TE shall set the \ value using the selected
AID and shall set the \ value to the requested EAP method. The TE
may set the \ value to the directory file identifier that is applicable
to the \; which is derived from the discretionary data returned by
+CUAD. The parameter is mandatory for EAP terminated in UICC.
If the targeted application on the UICC does support the requested EAP method,
the MT shall use the value provided in \, and it shall transmit the
\ to the UICC application using the Authenticate APDU command
as defined in ETSI TS 102 310 [66]. The appropriate DF~EAP~ in the ADF must be
selected prior to the submission of an EAP Authenticate command with the \. Then the EAP Response data sent by the UICC application in its
response to the Authenticate command shall be provided to the TE in \.
If the targeted application on the UICC does not support the requested EAP
method and if the MT does support this method then the \
shall be handled by the MT. During the handling of the EAP method, the MT
shall run the authentication algorithm on the SIM or USIM, respectively.
Also the MT has to allocate an \ in order to identify an EAP
session and its corresponding keys and parameters.
If neither the MT nor the appropriate UICC application support the requested

**Description**
The execution of this command will get the size (in pixels) of the ME screen.
The x-axis and y-axis will be based on a single normal operating mode of the
ME, see Figure 8.54-1. The 0,0 point will always be located at the top left
corner of the screen in the normal operating mode. Changing the phone's mode
from portrait to landscape does not change the physical location of 0,0 or how
the x and y axes are interpreted.
If emulation fails with an ME error, +CME ERROR: \ is returned. Refer to
subclause 9.2 for \ values. This command should be accepted (OK returned)
before returning the screen size of the device.

## 8.57 Informative examples
Phone Activity Status (+CPAS) is a general command used to detect the presence
of the MT, if there is an incoming call, or if there is a call in progress.
This command is normally used before trying to operate the MT from the TE.
Note that the activity status can change at any time after the execution of
+CPAS, and hence the returned value can be obsolete. Detachment of the MT from
the TA is indicated with a special final result code that indicates all errors
related to the operation of the MT. Result code is +CME ERROR: \, where
\ is an integer or verbose value giving useful information about the
reason for the command failure (refer subclause \"Mobile Termination error
result code +CME ERROR\").
Set Phone Functionality (+CFUN) can be used to reset the MT or set the power
consumption level of the MT by disabling certain parts of the MT (e.g. the
transmit and receive RF circuits). Mobile Termination Control Mode (+CMEC) is
a command which manages access sharing between the MT and the TE to operate
the user interface of the MT. It has four subparameters which describe the
access to keypad, display, indicators, and touch screen. Each subparameter has
values for restricting the operation of the corresponding user interface part
only to the MT or only to the TE, or to give the access for both of them.
Keypad Control command (+CKPD) is used to operate the keypad of the MT. Here
lies the problem of different keypad types between manufacturers, and also
between their MT models. The keypresses are sent to the MT as a string type
subparameter of this command. Each character in that string represents a key
which will be logically pressed. A special character (colon) followed by any
character can be used by manufacturers (or TE application programmers) to
represent a key which is not defined in this profile. An escape character
(semicolon) for direct string entering is also defined. All text between
single semicolon characters is treated as an alphanumeric entry and is not
converted to keypressings. All semicolon characters inside the text is
duplicated in the TE and stripped back to one before entering them to the MT.
Command has also optional second and third parameters which can be used to
alter the time to strike each key, and the pause to wait between keystrokes
(in tenths of a second). A special pause character (W or w) can be added in
the string type subparameter for an extra pause of the same length as given by
the third subparameter. In the following example alphanumeric mode is entered
and a person predefined in the MT phonebook, \"Ilkka\", is called; each key is
struck for half a second and pauses between strokes are a tenth of a second:
AT+CKPD=\"@:Ilkka:S\",5,1
OK
Display Control command (+CDIS) is used both for writing to the display text
fields and for reading the current status of the fields. Mobile termination
usually have a character set of their own, so the TA will do a conversion
between the TE and the MT character sets. TE can have several character sets
and the TA must be informed of the character set in use before starting to
write or read the display. Character set is set with general command Select TE
Character Set +CSCS. The +CDIS=? query command is a way to get information
about the length of the fields. In the following example an MT is first
queried about the supported conversions and the lengths of the fields. The
response shows there are three ten character long and two six character long
fields. Then the TE character set is set to be IRA and the current status of
the display is read. The last command writes the text \"Hello, I\'m writing to
display\" in the three fields, and keeps the contents of the two other fields
same (the last two commas could also be left out).
AT+CSCS=?;+CDIS=?
+CSCS: (\"IRA\",\"PCCP850\",\"8859‑1\")
+CDIS: 10,10,10,6,6
OK
AT+CSCS=\"IRA\"
OK
AT+CDIS?
+CDIS: \"RADIOLINJA\",\"\",\"\",\"Menu\",\"Memory\"
OK
AT+CDIS=\"IRA\",\"Hello, I\'m\",\"writing to\",\"display\",,
OK
The writing is possible only when it is permitted by the Mobile Termination
Control Mode command (and by the manufacturer). If a certain field is not
writable (but is readable), writing to it is ignored. The order of the text
fields is determined by manufacturers and follow the rule: first field is in
the upper left corner, second in the next field to the right, and so on, until
to the last field in the lower right corner.
Touch screen action Control command (+CTSA) is used to operate the touch
screen of the MT. The x, y coordinates of the phone are fixed even if the
device is turned sideways or changes modes between landscape and portrait. In
the following example commands are sent to the MT to emulate a user drawing on
the touch screen. The screen is touched at location 10,10, then dragged to
50,50, then dragged to 100,100 and finally the touch screen is released at
location 100,100.
AT+CTSA=1,10,10\ AT+CTSA=1,50,50\ +CTSA=0,100,100
Indicators can be handled with Indicator Control command (+CIND). Its query
command returns a short description (abbreviation) of the purpose of the
indicators and the supported values for each indicator. The setting and
reading is done similarly as with Display Control command. In the following
example the indicators of a phone are queried, their current value is read,
and the value of message indicator is tried to set (but it is forbidden):.
AT+CIND=?
+CIND: (\"memory\",(0‑2)),(\"call\",(0,1)),(\"data\",(0,1)),(\"roam\",(0,1)),
(\"alpha\",(0,1)),(\"message\",(0,1)),(\"index1\",(0‑11)),(\"index2\",(0‑11)),
(\"index3\",(0‑11)),(\"signal\",(0‑5)),(\"service\",(0,1)),(\"sel1\",(0,1)),
(\"sel2\",(0,1)),(\"sel3\",(0,1)),(\"battchg\",(0‑5))
OK
AT+CIND?
+CIND: 1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,5
OK
AT+CIND=,,,,,0
+CME ERROR: 10
The subparameter order in the command is defined by the query command order,
not by the actual display order. The zero value of an indicator means that it
is off (or in state which can be identified as \"off\"‑state), value one means
that the indicator is on (or in a state which is more substantial than
\"off\"‑state), value two is more substantial than one, and so on.
To this point, only operating through the TE is covered. But when MT can be
operated also through its keypad, or touch screen, or there are changes in the
status of the display elements, the information about these actions is given
to the TE also. This can be solved only with unsolicited result codes which
return keypad, display text and indicator, and touch screen events. Each event
group has a result code of its own: +CKEV returns the key code and if the key
pressed (1) or released (0), +CDEV returns the display text field running
number (as specified by command +CDIS) and the new status of the field, and
+CIEV returns the running number of the indicator (refer +CIND) and the new
value of it, and +CTEV returns the location of the action performed on the
touch screen. In the following example number key 1 is pressed, updated on the
display, released, and signal strength changes its state to five:
+CKEV: 49,1
+CDEV: 1,\"1\"
+CKEV: 49,0
+CIND: 10,5
Mobile Termination Event Reporting command (+CMER) has been specified for the
purpose of controlling the sending of these unsolicited result codes to the
TE. Four ways are provided to handle the buffering of the result codes (see
figure 8). The first is to buffer them always. The second possibility is to
discard them when in on‑line data mode and otherwise forward them directly to
the TE. The third possibility is to buffer them in data mode and otherwise
forward them to the TE. The last possibility is to send them always to the TE
(some inband technique - e.g. V.80 - is used in data mode to send the result
codes within the data). This is the first subparameter of +CMER command. Next
three subparameters are used to enable or disable each of the keypad, text
field and indicator result codes. Sending codes can be enabled either so that
only events generated from the MT user interface are returned, or so that also
events caused by Keypad, Display and Indicator Control commands are returned.
The fifth subparameter controls the flushing of the buffer when the value of
the first subparameter is changed to a value from one to three.

AT+CSCS=\"IRA\" (set TE character set for display text results)
OK
AT+CMER=1,0,2,2,0 (return display text and indicator result codes when
OK in command state, in data mode discard them)
AT+CDIS?;+CIND? (read current state of display texts and indicators)
+CDIS: \"\",\"\",\" 12345\",\"Menu\",\"Memory\" (user had pressed number
buttons before
+CIND: 1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,5 TE took control with +CMEC)
OK
AT+CKPD=\"C\",20 (clear main display text \'12345\' by holding the
OK \'clear\' button down two seconds)
+CDEV: 3,\"1234\" (first only one character deleted)
+CDEV: 3,\"\" (while holding continues, whole display is cleared)
+CDEV: 1,\"RADIOLINJA\" (operator name comes to the display)
The start of the previous example could go as follows when MT has already been
powered on but is waiting for the PIN:
AT+CMEE=2;+CREG=1 (use verbose \ values; report registration)
OK
AT+CPAS (query MT status)
+CPAS: 0 (MT is ready to receive commands)
OK
AT+CPIN? (is MT asking passwords?)
+CPIN: SIM PIN (yes, SIM PIN required)
AT+CPIN=\"4321\"
OK (correct PIN)
One of the most regular operations done through the MT user interface is
phonebook control. To lessen the workload of the TE, some direct commands for
phonebook reading and writing are practical. Command Select Phonebook Memory
Storage +CPBS query version returns supported phonebook memories, read version
returns current settings, and set version selects the memory. For GSM, the
normal storages are SIM, MT and TA.
Read Phonebook Entries (+CPBR) can be used to read either one or many
phonebook locations at the same time. A regular phonebook entry consists of
three elements: memory index number, the phone number and its alphanumeric
equivalent given by the user. Query version of this returns supported index
values of the selected memory, and the maximum lengths of the number and
alphanumeric elements. The query version of the Write Phonebook Entry command
(+CPBW) is similar, but the action version sets or clears an entry in the
phonebook. Find Phonebook Entries (+CPBF) can be used to search alphanumeric
entries starting with specific string. An example where the whole phonebook of
the MT is read, index number four is cleared, and number three is written:
AT+CPBS=?
+CPBS: (\"ME\",\"SM\") (MT and SIM have phonebooks)
OK
AT+CPBS=\"ME\" (select MT memory)
OK
AT+CPBR=? (read index range and element lengths)
+CPBR: (1‑99),30,30
OK
AT+CPBR=1,99 (read all entries but only the ones set are returned)
+CPBR: 1,\"931123456\",129,\"Ilkka\"
+CPBR: 2,\"9501234567\",129,\"\"
+CPBR: 4,\"901234567\",129,\"Hesari\"
OK
AT+CPBW=4;+CPBW=3,\"921123456\",,\"TS\" (clear index 4 and write index 3)

# 10 Commands for Packet Domain
## 10.0 General
This clause defines commands that a TE can be used to control a MT supporting
packet switched services. Some aspects of a Packet Domain MT are described in
3GPP TS 27.060 [34].
It is anticipated that Packet Domain MTs will vary widely in functionality. At
one extreme, a MT supporting CS/PS or class-A mode of operation might support
multiple PDP types as well as circuit switched data, and use multiple external
networks and QoS profiles. At the other extreme a MT supporting only PS or
class-C mode of operation might support only a single PDP type using a single
external network, and rely on the HLR to contain the PDP context definition.
A comprehensive set of Packet Domain-specific commands is defined in subclause
10.1 to provide the flexibility needed by the more complex MT. The commands
are designed to be expandable to accommodate new PDP types and interface
protocols, merely by defining new values for many of the parameters. Multiple
contexts can be activated if the interface link-layer protocol is able to
support them. The commands use the extended information and error message
capabilities described in this specification.
For MTs of intermediate complexity, most commands have simplified forms where
certain parameters can be omitted.
For the simplest MTs, and for backwards compatibility with existing
communications software, it is possible to control access to the Packet Domain
using existing modem-compatible commands. A special dial-string syntax is
defined for use with the D command. This \"modem compatible\" mode of
operation is described in subclause 10.2.
A discussion on the interaction of the AT commands, Packet Domain Management
and Packet Data Protocols, together with examples of command sequences for a
number of applications can be found in 3GPP TS 27.060 [34].
## 10.1 Commands specific to MTs supporting the Packet Domain
### 10.1.0 General remark about EPS bearer contexts and PDP contexts
Accordingly to 3GPP TS 23.401 [82], there is a 1 to 1 mapping between active
EPS bearer context and active PDP context:
\- An active default EPS bearer context is associated with an active non
secondary PDP context.
\- An active dedicated EPS bearer context is associated with an active
secondary PDP context.
In consequence to the implicit logical relation between EPS PDN connection and
its associated Default EPS Bearer, hereafter a same non secondary PDP context
identifier \ can be used to refer either an EPS PDN connection context
or its associated Default EPS Bearer context.
As dedicated EPS bearer contexts are activated by the network, the network can
then activate a new dedicated EPS bearer or modify an existing one to fulfil
the request.For bearer resources activated by the network a context identifier
is allocated by the MT/TA.
For easy reading the term PDP context is used for PDP contexts in UMTS/GPRS as
well as PDN/default EPS bearers and traffic flows in EPS.

**Description**
This command allows the TE to specify a Packet Filter - PF for a Traffic Flow
Template - TFT that is used in the GGSN in UMTS/GPRS and Packet GW in EPS for
routing of packets onto different QoS flows towards the TE. The concept is
further described in the 3GPP TS 23.060 [47]. A TFT consists of from one and
up to 16 Packet Filters, each identified by a unique \. A Packet Filter also has an \ that
is unique within all TFTs associated with all PDP contexts that are associated
with the same PDP address.
The set command specifies a Packet Filter that is to be added to the TFT
stored in the MT and used for the context identified by the (local) context
identification parameter, \. The specified TFT will be stored in the GGSN
in UMTS/GPRS and Packet GW in EPS only at activation or MS-initiated
modification of the related context. Since this is the same parameter that is
used in the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands, the +CGTFT command is effectively
an extension to these commands. The Packet Filters consist of a number of
parameters, each of which may be set to a separate value.
A special form of the set command, +CGTFT= \ causes all of the Packet
Filters in the TFT for context number \ to become undefined. At any time
there may exist only one PDP context with no associated TFT amongst all PDP
contexts associated to one PDP address. At an attempt to delete a TFT, which
would violate this rule, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is returned. Extended
error responses are enabled by the +CMEE command.
The read command returns the current settings for all Packet Filters for each
defined context.
The test command returns values supported as a compound value. If the MT
supports several PDP types, the parameter value ranges for each PDP type are
returned on a separate line. TFTs shall be used for PDP-type IP and PPP only.
For PDP-type PPP a TFT is applicable only when IP traffic is carried over PPP.
If PPP carries header-compressed IP packets, then a TFT cannot be used.
**Defined values**
\: a numeric parameter which specifies a particular PDP context
definition (see the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).
The following parameters are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [47]:
\: a numeric parameter, value range from 1 to 16.
\: a numeric parameter. The value range is from 0
to 255.
\: string type. The string is given as dot-
separated numeric (0-255) parameters on the form:\ \"a1.a2.a3.a4.m1.m2.m3.m4\"
for IPv4 or\
\"a1.a2.a3.a4.a5.a6.a7.a8.a9.a10.a11.a12.a13.a14.a15.a16.m1.m2.m3.m4.m5.m6.m7.m8.m9.m10.m11.m12.m13.m14.m15.m16\",

\:\
string type. The string is given as dot-separated numeric (0-255) parameters
on the form \"t.m\".
\: numeric value in hexadecimal format. The value range is
from 00000 to FFFFF. Valid for IPv6 only.
\: a numeric parameter which specifies the transmission direction
in which the packet filter shall be applied.\ 0 - Pre-Release 7 TFT filter
(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [8], table 10.5.162)\ 1 - Uplink\ 2 - Downlink\
[3]{.underline} - Birectional (Up & Downlink) (default if omitted)
Some of the above listed attributes may coexist in a Packet Filter while
others mutually exclude each other, the possible combinations are shown in
3GPP TS 23.060 [47].

**Description**
This command allows the TE to specify a UMTS Quality of Service Profile that
is used when the MT sends an Activate PDP Context Request message to the
network.
The set command specifies a profile for the context identified by the (local)
context identification parameter, \. The specified profile will be stored
in the MT and sent to the network only at activation or MS-initiated
modification of the related context. Since this is the same parameter that is
used in the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands, the +CGEQREQ command is
effectively an extension to these commands. The QoS profile consists of a
number of parameters, each of which may be set to a separate value.
A special form of the set command, +CGEQREQ= \ causes the requested
profile for context number \ to become undefined.
The read command returns the current settings for each defined context.
The test command returns values supported as a compound value. If the MT
supports several PDP types, the parameter value ranges for each PDP type are
returned on a separate line.
**Defined values**
\: a numeric parameter which specifies a particular PDP context
definition (see +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).
The following parameters are defined in 3GPP TS 23.107 [46]:
\: a numeric parameter that indicates the type of application

\: a numeric parameter that indicates the maximum number
of kbits/s delivered to UMTS (up-link traffic) at a SAP. As an example a
bitrate of 32kbit/s would be specified as \'32\' (e.g. AT+CGEQREQ=...,32,
...). This parameter should be provided if the Traffic class is specified as

**Description**
This command allows the TE to specify a minimum acceptable profile, which is
checked by the MT against the negotiated profile returned in the
Activate/Modify PDP Context Accept message.
The set command specifies a profile for the context identified by the (local)
context identification parameter, \. The specified profile will be stored
in the MT and checked against the negotiated profile only at activation or MS-
initiated modification of the related context. Since this is the same
parameter that is used in the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands, the +CGEQMIN
command is effectively an extension to these commands. The QoS profile
consists of a number of parameters, each of which may be set to a separate
value.
A special form of the set command, +CGEQMIN= \ causes the minimum
acceptable profile for context number \ to become undefined. In this case
no check is made against the negotiated profile.
The read command returns the current settings for each defined context.
The test command returns values supported as a compound value. If the MT
supports several PDP types, the parameter value ranges for each PDP type are
returned on a separate line.
**Defined values**
\: a numeric parameter which specifies a particular PDP context
definition (see +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).
The following parameters are defined in 3GPP TS 23.107 [46]:

**Description**
The execution command is used to attach the MT to, or detach the MT from, the
Packet Domain service. After the command has completed, the MT remains in
V.250 command state. If the MT is already in the requested state, the command
is ignored and the OK response is returned. If the requested state cannot be
achieved, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is returned. Extended error
responses are enabled by the +CMEE command.
Any active PDP contexts will be automatically deactivated when the attachment
state changes to detached.
The read command returns the current Packet Domain service state.
The test command is used for requesting information on the supported Packet
Domain service states.
NOTE: This command has the characteristics of both the V.250 action and
parameter commands. Hence it has the read form in addition to the
execution/set and test forms.
**Defined Values**
\: indicates the state of PS attachment\ 0 - detached\ 1 - attached\
Other values are reserved and will result in an ERROR response to the
execution command.

**Description**
The execution command is used to activate or deactivate the specified PDP
context (s). After the command has completed, the MT remains in V.250 command
state. If any PDP context is already in the requested state, the state for
that context remains unchanged. If the requested state for any specified
context cannot be achieved, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is returned.
Extended error responses are enabled by the +CMEE command. If the MT is not PS
attached when the activation form of the command is executed, the MT first
performs a PS attach and then attempts to activate the specified contexts. If
the attach fails then the MT responds with ERROR or, if extended error
responses are enabled, with the appropriate failure-to-attach error message.
For EPS, if an attempt is made to disconnect the last PDN connection, then the
MT responds with ERROR or, if extended error responses are enabled, a +CME
ERROR.
For EPS, the activation request for an EPS bearer resource will be answered by
the network by either an EPS dedicated bearer activation or EPS bearer
modification request. The request must be accepted by the MT before the PDP
context can be set in to established state.
If no \s are specified the activation form of the command activates all
defined contexts.
If no \s are specified the deactivation form of the command deactivates
all active contexts.
The read command returns the current activation states for all the defined PDP
contexts.
The test command is used for requesting information on the supported PDP
context activation states.
NOTE. This command has the characteristics of both the V.250 action and
parameter commands. Hence it has the read form in addition to the
execution/set and test forms.
**Defined Values**
\: indicates the state of PDP context activation\ 0 - deactivated\ 1 -
activated\ Other values are reserved and will result in an ERROR response to
the execution command.

**Description**
The execution command is used to modify the specified PDP context (s) with
repect to QoS profiles and TFTs. After the command has completed, the MT
returns to V.250 online data state. If the requested modification for any
specified context cannot be achieved, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is
returned. Extended error responses are enabled by the +CMEE command.
For EPS, the modification request for an EPS bearer resource will be answered
by the network by an EPS bearer modification request. The request must be
accepted by the MT before the PDP context is effectively changed.
If no \s are specified the activation form of the command modifies all
active contexts.
The test command returns a list of \s associated with active contexts.

* * *
Command Possible Response(s)
+CGDATA=[\ [,\ [,\ [,...]]]] CONNECT\ ERROR
+CGDATA=? +CGDATA: (list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
The execution command causes the MT to perform whatever actions are necessary
to establish communication between the TE and the network using one or more
Packet Domain PDP types. This may include performing a PS attach and one or
more PDP context activations. If the \ parameter value is unacceptable to
the MT, the MT shall return an ERROR or +CME ERROR response. Otherwise, the MT
issues the intermediate result code CONNECT and enters V.250 online data
state.
Commands following +CGDATA command in the AT command line shall not be
processed by the MT.
The detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is
dependent on the PDP type. It is described briefly in 3GPP TS 27.060 [34] and
in more detail in 3GPP TS 29.061 [39] and the specifications for the relevant
PDPs. PS attachment and PDP context activation procedures may take place prior
to or during the PDP startup if they have not already been performed using the
+CGATT and +CGACT commands.
If context activation takes place during the PDP startup, one or more \s
may be specified in order to provide the information needed for the context
activation request(s).
During each PDP startup procedure the MT may have access to some or all of the
following information -
The MT may have a priori knowledge, for example, it may implement only one PDP
type.
The command may have provided an \ parameter value.
The TE may provide a PDP type and/or PDP address to the MT during in the PDP
startup procedure.
If any of this information is in conflict, the command will fail.
Any PDP type and/or PDP address present in the above information shall be
compared with the PDP type and/or PDP address in any context definitions
specified in the command in the order in which their \s appear. For a
context definition to match -
The PDP type must match exactly.
The PDP addresses are considered to match if they are identical or if either
or both addresses are unspecified. For example, a PPP NCP request specifying
PDP type = IP and no PDP address would cause the MT to search through the
specified context definitions for one with PDP type = IP and any PDP address.
The context shall be activated using the matched value for PDP type and a
static PDP address if available, together with the other information found in
the PDP context definition. If a static PDP address is not available then a
dynamic address is requested.
If no \ is given or if there is no matching context definition, the MT
shall attempt to activate the context with whatever information is available
to the MT. The other context parameters shall be set to their default values.
If the activation is successful, data transfer may proceed.
After data transfer is complete, and the layer 2 protocol termination
procedure has completed successfully, the V.250 command state is re-entered
and the MT returns the final result code OK.
In the event of an erroneous termination or a failure to start up, the V.250
command state is re-entered and the MT returns the final result code NO
CARRIER or, if enabled, +CME ERROR. Attach, activate and other errors may be
reported.
The test command is used for requesting information on the supported layer 2
protocols.
This command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.
**Defined Values**
\: a string parameter that indicates the layer 2 protocol to be used
between the TE and MT\ NULL none, for PDP type OSP:IHOSS (Obsolete)\ PPP
Point-to-point protocol for a PDP such as IP\ PAD character stream for X.25
character (triple X PAD) mode (Obsolete)\ X25 X.25 L2 (LAPB) for X.25 packet
mode (Obsolete)\ M-xxxx manufacturer-specific protocol (xxxx is an
alphanumeric string)
If the value is omitted, the layer 2 protocol is unspecified. Other values are
reserved and will result in an ERROR response.
\: a numeric parameter which specifies a particular PDP context
definition (see the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).
**Implementation**
Optional if the D (dial) command can be used to specify Packet Domain
operation.

**Description**
The set command disables or enables an automatic positive or negative response
(auto-answer) to the receipt of a NW-initiated Request PDP Context Activation
message from the network in UMTS/GPRS and a NW-initiated Request EPS Bearer
Activation/ Modification Request messages in EPS. It also provides control
over the use of the V.250 basic commands \'S0\', \'A\' and \'H\' for handling
network requests for PDP context activation. The setting does not affect the
issuing of the unsolicited result code RING or +CRING.
The test command returns the values of \ supported by the MT as a compound
value.
When the +CGAUTO=0 command is received, the MT shall not perform a PS detach
if it is attached. Subsequently, when the MT announces a network request for
PDP context activation by issuing the unsolicited result code RING or +CRING,
the TE may manually accept or reject the request by issuing the +CGANS command
or may simply ignore the network request.
When the +CGAUTO=1 command is received, the MT shall attempt to perform a PS
attach if it is not already attached. Failure will result in ERROR or, if
enabled, +CME ERROR being returned to the TE. Subsequently, when the MT
announces a network request for PDP context activation by issuing the
unsolicited result code RING or +CRING to the TE, this is followed by the
intermediate result code CONNECT. The MT then enters V.250 online data state
and follows the same procedure as it would after having received a +CGANS=1
with no \ or \ values specified.
**Defined values**
\:
> 0 turn off automatic response for Packet Domain only\ 1 turn on automatic
> response for Packet Domain only\ 2 modem compatibility mode, Packet Domain
> only\ [3]{.underline} modem compatibility mode, Packet Domain and circuit
> switched calls (default)\ 4 turn on automatic negative response for Packet
> Domain only
For \ = 0 Packet DomainS network requests are manually accepted or rejected
by the +CGANS command.
For \ = 1 Packet Domain network requests are automatically accepted
according to the description above.
For \ = 2, automatic acceptance of Packet Domain network requests is
controlled by the \'S0\' command. Manual control uses the \'A\' and \'H\'
commands, respectively, to accept and reject Packet Domain requests. (+CGANS
may also be used.) Incoming circuit switched calls can be neither manually nor
automatically answered.
For \ = 3, automatic acceptance of both Packet Domain network requests and
incoming circuit switched calls is controlled by the \'S0\' command. Manual
control uses the \'A\' and \'H\' commands, respectively, to accept and reject
Packet Domain requests. (+CGANS may also be used.) Circuit switched calls are
handled as described elsewhere in this specification.
For \ = 4, Packet Domain network requests are automatically rejected.
**Implementation**
Optional. If not implemented, the MT shall behave according to the case of
\ = 3.
### 10.1.16 Manual response to a network request for PDP context activation
+CGANS
Table 125: CGANS action command syntax
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Command | Possible response(s) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CGANS=[\, [\ | OK | | ,[\]]] | | | | ERROR | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CGANS=? | +CGANS: (list of supported | | | \s), (list of | | | supported \s) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
**Description**
The execution command requests the MT to respond to a network request for
Packet Domain PDP context activation which has been signalled to the TE by the
RING, +CRING or +CGEV unsolicited result code. The \ parameter
allows the TE to accept or reject the request.
If \ is 0, the request is rejected and the MT returns OK to the TE.
If \ is 1, the following procedure is followed by the MT.
Commands following the +CGANS command in the AT command line shall not be
processed by the MT.
If the \ parameter value is unacceptable to the MT, the MT shall return
an ERROR or +CME ERROR response. Otherwise, the MT issues the intermediate
result code CONNECT and enters V.250 online data state.
The detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is
dependent on the PDP type. It is described briefly in 3GPP TS 27.060 [34] and
in more detail in 3GPP TS 29.061 [39] and the specifications for the relevant
PDPs. PDP context activation procedures shall take place prior to or during
the PDP startup.
One or more \s may be specified in order to provide the values needed for
the context activation request.
During the PDP startup procedure the MT has the PDP type and the PDP address
provided by the network in the Request PDP Context Activation message. The MT
may also have some or all of the following information -
The MT may have a priori knowledge, for example, it may implement only one PDP
type.
The command may have provided an \ parameter value.
The TE may provide one or both of PDP type and PDP address to the MT in the
PDP startup.
If any of this information is in conflict, the command will fail.
If one or more \ is given then an attempt shall be made to identify an
appropriate context definition by matching the PDP type and PDP address in the
network request with the PDP type and PDP address in each of the specified
context definitions (in the order in which their \s appear in the
command) as follows:
The PDP type must match exactly.
The PDP addresses are considered to match if they are identical or if the
address in the context definition is unspecified.
The context shall be activated using the values for PDP type and PDP address
provided by the network, together with the other information found in the PDP
context definition. An APN may or may not re required, depending on the
application.
If no \ is given or if there is no matching context definition, the MT
will attempt to activate the context using the values for PDP type and PDP
address provided by the network, together with any other relevant information
known to the MT. The other context parameters will be set to their default
values.
If the activation is successful, data transfer may proceed.
After data transfer is complete, and the layer 2 protocol termination
procedure has completed successfully, the V.250 command state is re-entered
and the MT returns the final result code OK
In the event of an erroneous termination or a failure to startup, the V.250
command state is re-entered and the MT returns the final result code NO
CARRIER or, if enabled, +CME ERROR. Attach, activate and other errors may be
reported. It is also an error to issue the +CGANS command when there is no
outstanding network request.
NOTE: This is not the same as if the MT issues a +CGDATA (or +CGACT) command
after receiving a +CRING unsolicited result code. A +CGDATA (or +CGACT) does
not command the MT to acknowledge the network request but rather to make a new
request for context activation. The network request would be ignored.
The test command returns the values of \ and \ supported by the
MT as compound values.
This command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.
**Defined values**
\: is a numeric parameter which specifies how the request should be
responded to.
> 0 reject the request\ 1 accept and request that the PDP context be activated
If \ is omitted it is assumed to be 0. Other values are reserved and
will result in the ERROR response.
\: a string parameter which indicates the layer 2 protocol to be used
(see +CGDATA command).
\: a numeric parameter which specifies a particular PDP context
definition (see the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).

**Description**
The set command is used to set the MT to operate according to the specified
mode of operation, see 3GPP TS 23.060 [47]. If the requested mode of operation
is not supported, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is returned. Extended error
responses are enabled by the +CMEE command.
The read command returns the mode of operation set by the TE, independent of
the current serving cell capability and independent of the current serving
cell Access Technology. If no value has been set by the TE previously, the
return value shall be the highest mode of operation that can be supported by
the MT.
The test command is used for requesting information on the supported MT mode
of operation.
**Defined Values**
\: a string parameter which indicates the mode of operation\ A Class-A
mode of operation (A/Gb mode), or CS/PS mode of operation (Iu mode) (highest
mode of operation)\ B Class-B mode of operation (A/Gb mode), or CS/PS mode of
operation (Iu mode)\ CG Class-C mode of operation in PS only mode (A/Gb mode),
or PS mode of operation (Iu mode)\ CC Class-C mode of operation in CS only
mode (A/Gb mode), or CS (Iu mode) (lowest mode of operation)
NOTE: \ A means that the MT would operate simultaneous PS and CS
service\ \ B means that the MT would operate PS and CS services but not
simultaneously in A/Gb mode\ \ CG means that the MT would only operate
PS services\ \ CC means that the MT would only operate CS services
Other values are reserved and will result in an ERROR response to the set
command.
If the MT is attached to the PS domain when the set command is issued with a
\ = CC specified, a PS detach shall be performed by the MT.

## 10.2 Modem compatibility commands
### 10.2.0 General
This subclause describes how existing AT commands, designed for use with a
modem, may be used to control a Packet Domain MT. This is to provide backwards
compatibility with existing communications software. For new applications it
is recommended that the Packet Domain-specific commands, described in previous
subclauses, be used.
### 10.2.1 MT originated PDP context activation
#### 10.2.1.0 General
In this mode of operation, the MT behaves like an originating modem and
accepts the normal V.250 commands associated with placing and clearing a call.
If Packet Domain-specific configuration commands are required, they may be
sent to the MT as part of the modem initialization commands.
#### 10.2.1.1 Request Packet Domain service \'D\'
Table 130: D command syntax
* * *
Command Possible Response(s)
D*\[*[\] [*[\][*[\[,\[,...]]]]]]#
CONNECT\ ERROR
* * *
**Description**
This command causes the MT to perform whatever actions are necessary to
establish communication between the TE and the external PDN.
The V.250 \'D\' (Dial) command causes the MT to enter the V.250 online data
state and, with the TE, to start the specified layer 2 protocol. The MT shall
return CONNECT to confirm acceptance of the command prior to entering the
V.250 online data state. No further commands may follow on the AT command
line.
The detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is
dependent on the PDP type. It is described briefly in clauses 9 (for IP) of
3GPP TS 27.060[34]. PS attachment and PDP context activation procedures may
take place prior to or during the PDP startup if they have not already been
performed using the +CGATT and +CGACT commands.
When the layer 2 protocol has terminated, either as a result of an orderly
shut down of the PDP or an error, the MT shall enter V.250 command state and
return the NO CARRIER final result code.
If \ is supported and provided, the MT shall automatically set
up a virtual call to the specified address after the PDP context has been
activated.
If \ and \ are supported, their usage shall be the same as in the
+CGDATA command. The +CGDCONT, +CGQREQ, etc. commands may be used in the modem
initialization AT command string to set values for for PDP type, APN, QoS
etc..
If \ is not supported or is supported but omitted, the MT shall use a
layer 2 protocol appropriate to the PDP type.
If \ is not supported or is supported but omitted, the MT shall attempt
to activate the context using:
(a) any information provided by the TE during the PDP startup procedure, e.g.
the TE may provide a PDP type and/or PDP address to the MT,
or, (b) a priori knowledge, e.g. the MT may implement only one PDP type,
> or, (c) using the \'Empty PDP type\' (3GPP TS 24.008 [8]). (No PDP address
> or APN shall be sent in this case and only one PDP context subscription
> record shall be present in the HLR for this subscriber.)
This command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.
NOTE: The dial string conforms to the syntax specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 [19].
**Defined Values**
\: (GPRS Service Code) a digit string (value 99) which identifies a
request to use the Packet Domain service
\: a string that identifies the called party in the address
space applicable to the PDP. For communications software that does not support
arbitrary characters in the dial string, a numeric equivalent may be used.
Also, the character comma \',\' may be used as a substitute for the character
period \'.\'.
\: a string which indicates the layer 2 protocol to be used (see +CGDATA
command). For communications software that does not support arbitrary
characters in the dial string, the following numeric equivalents shall be
used:\ 0 NULL (Obsolete)\ 1 PPP\ 2 PAD (Obsolete)\ 3 X25 (Obsolete)\ 9yyyy
M-xxxx\ Other values are reserved and will result in an ERROR response
\: a digit string which specifies a particular PDP context definition
(see the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).
**Implementation**
Optional if the +CGDATA command is supported. If the D command is provided,
then support for \, \ and \ are optional. If they
are not supported but values are provided by the TE, the values shall be
ignored and this shall not constitute an error.
#### 10.2.1.2 Request Packet Domain IP service \'D\'
Table 131: D command syntax
* * *
Command Possible Response(s)
D*\[*\[,\[,...]]]# CONNECT\ ERROR
* * *
**Description**
This command causes the MT to perform whatever actions are necessary to
establish communication between the TE and the external PDN.
The V.250 \'D\' (Dial) command causes the MT to enter the V.250 online data
state and, with the TE, to start the specified layer 2 protocol. The MT shall
return CONNECT to confirm acceptance of the command prior to entering the
V.250 online data state. No further commands may follow on the AT command
line.
The detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is
described briefly in clause 9, for IP, of 3GPP TS 27.060 [34]. GPRS attachment
and PDP context activation procedures may take place prior to or during the
PDP startup if they have not already been performed using the +CGATT and
+CGACT commands.
When the layer 2 protocol has terminated, either as a result of an orderly
shut down of the PDP or an error, the MT shall enter V.250 command state and
return the NO CARRIER final result code.
If \ is supported, its usage shall be the same as in the +CGDATA command.
The +CGDCONT, +CGQREQ, etc. commands may be used in the modem initialization
AT command string to set values for for PDP type, APN, QoS etc.
If \ is not supported or is supported but omitted, the MT shall attempt
to activate the context using:
(a) any information provided by the TE during the PDP startup procedure, e.g.
the TE may provide a PDP type and/or PDP address to the MT,
or, (b) a priori knowledge, e.g. the MT may implement only one PDP type,
> or, (c) using the \'Empty PDP type\' (3GPP TS 24.008 [8]). (No PDP address
> or APN shall be sent in this case and only one PDP context subscription
> record shall be present in the HLR for this subscriber.)
This command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.
NOTE. The dial string conforms to the syntax specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 [19].
**Defined Values**
\: (GPRS Service Code for IP) a digit string (value 98) which
identifies a request to use the GPRS with IP (PDP types IP and PPP)
\: a digit string which specifies a particular PDP context definition
(see +CGDCONT command).
**Implementation**
Optional if the +CGDATA command is supported. If the D command is provided,
then support for \ is optional. If it is not supported but a value is
provided by the TE, the value shall be ignored and this shall not constitute
an error.
### 10.2.2 Network requested PDP context activation
#### 10.2.2.0 General
In this mode of operation, the MT behaves like an answering modem and accepts
the normal V.250 commands associated with answering a call. If Packet Domain-
specific configuration commands are required, they may be sent to the MT as
part of the modem initialization commands.
The +CGAUTO command is used to select modem compatibility mode.
#### 10.2.2.1 Automatic response to a network request for PDP context
activation \'S0\'
The V.250 \'S0=n\' (Automatic answer) command may be used to turn off (n=0)
and on (n>0) the automatic response to a network request for a PDP context
activation.
When the \'S0=n\' (n>0) command is received, the MT shall attempt to perform a
PS attach if it is not already attached. Failure will result in ERROR being
returned to the TE. Subsequently, the MT will announce a network request for
PDP context activation by issuing the unsolicited result code RING to the TE,
followed by the intermediate result code CONNECT. The MT then enters V.250
online data state and follows the same procedure as it would after having
received a +CGANS=1 with no \ or \ values specified.
NOTE: The \'S0=n\' (n=0) command does not perform an automatic PS detach.
**Implementation**
Optional.
#### 10.2.2.2 Manual acceptance of a network request for PDP context
activation \'A\'
The V.250 \'A\' (Answer) command may be used to accept a network request for a
PDP context activation announced by the unsolicited result code RING. The MT
responds with CONNECT, enters V.250 online data state and follows the same
procedure as it would after having received a +CGANS=1 with no \ or
\ values specified. It is an error to issue the \'A\' command when there
is no outstanding network request.
**Implementation**
Optional.
#### 10.2.2.3 Manual rejection of a network request for PDP context activation
\'H\'
The V.250 \'H\' or \'H0\' (On-hook) command may be used to reject a network
request for PDP context activation announced by the unsolicited result code
RING. The MT responds with OK. It is an error to issue the \'H\' command when
there is no outstanding network request.
NOTE: This is an extension to the usage of the \'H\' command that is described
in ITU-T V.250.
**Implementation**
Optional.
# 11 Commands for VGCS and VBS
## 11.0 General
This clause defines commands that a TE may use to control a VGCS or VBS
supporting MT. The requirements for the VGCS and VBS are included in the
following specifications:
\- Voice Group Call service (VGCS): GSM 42.068 [55],GSM 43.068 [49],GSM 44.068
[52];
\- Voice Broadcast Service (VBS): GSM 42.069 [56],GSM 43.069 [50],GSM 44.069
[53].
It is anticipated that VGCS or VBS supporting MTs will vary widely in
functionality.
A comprehensive set of VGCS and VBS-specific commands is defined in subclause
11.1 to provide the flexibility needed by the more complex MT. The commands
use the extended information and error message capabilities described in this
specification.
For the simplest MTs, and for backwards compatibility with existing
communications software, it is possible to control access to the VGCS and VBS
using existing modem-compatible commands. A special dial-string syntax is
defined for use with the D command. This \"modem compatible\" mode of
operation is described in subclause 11.2.

**Description**
The execute command emulates the Short Data Transmission during ongoing VGCS
according to 3GPP TS 42.068 [55] and 3GPP TS 43.068 [49].
The application indicator \ is used to identify whether the application
data is an application-specific data or is a confirmation. The data identifier
\ is to provide a sequence number of the sending of application data.
The value of the data identifier \ is dependent on the value of the
application indicator \. If the application indicator \ indicates
sending application data to the network, the data identifier \
contains a number from the range between 0 and 15 which is generated by the
mobile station. If the application indicator \ indicates sending
confirmation of the reception of the application data, the data identifier
\ shall contain the data identifier which was received in the data
identity sent by the previous sender. The distribution parameter \
contains information to which participants shall be transferred the short
data.
The response CEPTT string from the network to the other participants is
returned in a subsequent unsolicited +CEPTT result code.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
**Defined values**
\
0 sending of application-specific data
1 confirmation of receiving application-specific data
\: 9 bytes application-specific data in hexadecimal character format
(for hexadecimal character format, refer +CSCS).

## 11.2 Modem compatibility commands
### 11.2.0 General
This sub-clause describes how existing AT commands, designed for use with a
modem, may be used to control a VGCS or VBS supporting MT. This is to provide
backwards compatibility with existing communications software.
### 11.2.1 Request VGCS or VBS service \'D\'
Table 141: D command syntax
* * *
Command Possible Response(s) D*\[*\]#\; _+CME ERROR: \
_
* * *
**Description**
This Dial command extension is a service request application according to 3GPP
TS 22.030 [19]. No further commands may follow on the AT command line.
Responses
When the call has terminated, either as a result of an orderly termination or
an error, the MT shall return the NO CARRIER final result code.
Possible error responses include +CME ERROR: \ when error is related to
MT functionality. The requested service, GId and priority level are checked
against the subscriptions of the user and the status of the GId stored on the
SIM. In case if no subscription is available for this service, GId or priority
level or the GId is deactivated an ERROR or +CMEE ERROR result code is
returned. See +CMEE ERROR extensions for VGCS, VBS and eMLPP in subclause 9.2.
Detailed error report of an unsuccessful originated call can be obtained with
command Extended Error Report +CEER (if implemented).
NOTE. The dial string conforms to the syntax specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 [19].
**Defined Values**
\: Service Code is a digit string which identifies a request to use\
value 17 Voice Group Call Service\ value 18 Voice Broadcast Service
> \: Service Code is a digit string which identifies a request to use
> eMLPP priority . Service Code values for different priority levels are
> specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 [19]
\: a digit string that specifies the group identification of a called
party.
**Implementation**
Mandatory for a MT supporting AT commands only and VGCS or VBS is implemented.
### 11.2.2 Termination of an Voice Group or Voice Broadcast Call \'H\'
The V.250 \'H\' or \'H0\' (On-hook) command may be used to terminate an
ongoing voice group or voice broadcast call. The MT responds with OK. It is an
error to issue the \'H\' command when there is no outstanding network request.
It is an error to issue the \'H\' command if the user is in group receive mode
or the user is not the originator of the call and a ERROR or +CME ERROR result
code is returned to the TE.
NOTE: This is an extension to the usage of the \'H\' command that is described
in ITU-T V.250.
**Implementation**
Mandatory for a MT supporting AT commands only and VGCS or VBS is implemented.

###### ## Annex C (informative): Commands from TIA IS‑101
# C.1 Introduction
The \"Voice Control Interim Standard for Asynchronous DCE\", TIA IS‑101,
contains some commands that are useful when passing audio \"data\" (that is,
data which represents audio information) between the computer and the TA.
Some of the following subclauses describe commands from IS‑101 which are
central to this TA application. However, with the exception of necessary
extensions, these descriptions are not intended to replace the definitions
found in IS‑101. Other novel commands from the interim standard are not
included because they are peripheral to TA operation.
NOTE 1: IS‑101 also uses V.250 [14] AT commands, but these are not mentioned
here.
The standard specifies the following modes:
‑ command mode, where there is no transfer of audio \"data\" between the TA
and the computer. In command mode, the computer is neither sending audio data
to the TA nor receiving audio data from the TA.
‑ transmit mode, where audio \"data\" is being transferred from the computer
to the TA. No audio \"data\" is transferred from the TA to the computer in
this state. A transition back to command mode occurs when an embedded command
indicates \"end of play\" or \"flush data\", or an inactivity timer times out.
‑ receive mode, where audio \"data\" is being transferred from the TA to the
computer. No audio \"data\" is transferred from the computer to the TA in this
state. A transition back to command mode occurs when any command is sent from
the computer, or an inactivity timer times out. During the receive mode, the
TA embeds result codes into the audio \"data\". These result codes indicate
pertanent events such as \"silence detected\", \"busy detected\", and so on.
Strictly, the standard specifies another mode (translation), but this is not
directly of interest here.
NOTE 2: The TA \"knows\" the type of an incoming call (whether it is voice,
data, fax, whatever), and certain POTS events cannot occur. Hence some
standard result codes for indication of events and discrimination of call type
are unnecessary.
There are three possible levels of service:
‑ a TA supporting level A performs the following operations and detects the
following events: audio transmit, audio receive, DTMF detection, DTMF
generation and single tone generation. The following indications are
supported:
[Event Description]{.underline} [Handset state]{.underline}
3 ring idle
4 DTMF received idle
5 receive buffer overrun receive
6 unsolicited fax request idle
8 phone on/off hook idle
9 presumed hangup receive
10 presumed end of message receive
18 ringback idle
19 busy idle
23 playback buffer underrun transmit
25 fax or data request acknowledged idle
‑ a TA supporting level B performs the operations and events of level A, and
also supports DTMF detection while in the transmit state.
‑ a TA supporting level C performs the operations and events of level B, and
also supports double DTMF tone generation.
Since DTMF detection and generation cannot be guaranteed over current digital
networks, it follows that none of the three levels of service can be
supported.
# C.2 Commands
## C.2.1 Select mode +FCLASS
This command puts the TA into a particular mode of operation (data, fax, voice
etc.). This causes the TA to process information in a manner suitable for that
type of information (rather than for other types of information). The values
and meanings of parameter \ are specified in the following table.
[\ Mode]{.underline}
0 data
1 fax class 1 (TIA‑578‑A)
1.0 fax class 1 (ITU‑T T.31 [11])
2 fax (manufacturer specific)
2.0 fax class 2 (ITU‑T T.32 [12] and TIA‑592)
3...7 reserved for other fax modes
8 voice
9...15 reserved for other voice modes
16..79 reserved
80 VoiceView (Radish)
81..255 reserved
Table C.1: +FCLASS
* * *
Command Return +FCLASS=\  
+FCLASS? \ +FCLASS=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
Voice mode is of particular interest here, and has an additional result code
+VCON. Specifically, +VCON indicates that the TA is entering the voice command
mode and there is a voice connection to at least one audio input or output.
This presupposes that some mechanism has previously initiated a connection to
that audio I/O.
## C.2.2 Buffer threshold setting +VBT
This refers to integers \ and \ that indicate levels within the TA
transmit buffer at which flow control is asserted and deasserted. The buffer
is used for averaging out the irregular timing of data from the computer, so
that the data becomes synchronous and may be sent to some audio device.
Table C.2: +VBT
* * *
Command Return +VBT=\,\  
+VBT? \,\ +VBT=? (list of supported \s),(list of supported
\s),(buffer size)
* * *
## C.2.3 Calling number ID presentation +VCID
The command refers to an integer that allows a called party to enable or
disable (\=0) the reporting of the ID of calling parties, and specifies the
method of presentation of the ID. This is basically the same as GSM/UMTS
supplementary service CLIP (Calling Line Identification Presentation). The
presentation may be either formatted (\=1) or unformatted (\=2):
‑ Formatted presentation : data items are reported in the form of
\=\ pairs.
[\]{.underline} [\]{.underline}
DATE MMDD (month, day)
TIME HHMM (hour, minute)
NMBR calling number or P or O (P = number is private, O = number is
unavailable)
NAME subscription listing name
MESG data from other (unknown) tags
‑ Unformatted presentation : here the data is presented in ASCII hex as
printable numbers.
Table C.3: +VCID
* * *
Command Return +VCID=\  
+VCID? \ +VCID=? (0‑2)
* * *
## C.2.4 Receive gain selection +VGR
This refers to the amplification by the TA of audio samples sent from the TA
to the computer. The command operates on an integer \, range 0...255.
Values larger than 128 indicate a larger gain than nominal. Values less than
128 indicate a smaller gain than nominal. The entire range of 0...255 does not
have to be provided. A value of zero implies the use of automatic gain control
by the TA.
Table C.4: +VGR
* * *
Command Return +VGR=\  
+VGR? \ +VGR=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.5 Transmit gain selection +VGT
This refers to the amplification by the TA of audio samples sent from the
computer to the TA. The command operates on an integer \, range 0...255.
Values larger than 128 indicate a larger gain than nominal. Values less than
128 indicate a smaller gain than nominal. The entire range of 0...255 does not
have to be provided. A value of zero implies the uses of automatic gain
control by the TA.
Table C.5: +VGT
* * *
Command Return +VGT=\  
+VGT? \ +VGT=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.6 Initialise voice parameters +VIP
This recalls manufacturer determined settings \ of voice parameters. The
command is write only. The effect of the command is manufacturer specific.
Table C.6: +VIP
* * *
Command Return +VIP=\  
+VIP=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.7 Inactivity timer +VIT
This refers to the value of the inactivity timer in the TA. It is used to
monitor activity on the connection between the computer and the TA when the
computer is in \"transmit\" mode and sending audio data to the TA. When the
connection has been inactive for the time set by this command, the TA leaves
\"transmit\" mode and reverts to command mode. An integer \ different than
zero implies a time of \/10 seconds. A value of zero disables the timer.
Table C.7: +VIT
* * *
Command Return +VIT=\  
+VIT? \ +VIT=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.8 Line selection +VLS
This determines the selection of sources and destinations of audio samples. An
integer is used to label a particular combination of sources and destinations.
The integer is defined in an entry in IS‑101 which assumes as a model a TA, a
local phone and a phone line. Two additional \"manufacturer specific\"
configurations (16,17) are defined.
‑ label=0: this is the idle state ‑ the phone is not connected to the radio
network and no audio paths are used.
‑ label=1: the phone is connected to the radio network and no audio paths
involving the internal microphone or internal loudspeaker are selected. This
allows the computer to transmit audio data over the radio transmitter by
selecting \"transmit mode\":

‑ label=7: the phone is connected to the radio network. The internal
microphone is connected to the radio transmitter. The radio receiver is
connected to the internal loudspeaker. This allows the computer to enable
normal phone operation (a human holding a conversation) by selecting command
mode.

**Manufacturer specific extension (reserved as such by IS‑101)**
‑ label=16: the phone is connected to the radio network. There is a path to
the internal microphone, which is also connected to the radio transmitter.
There is a path to the radio receiver, which is also connected to the internal
loudspeaker. This allows the computer to record the sum of transmitted and
received audio by selecting \"receive mode\".

## C.2.9 Receive data state +VRX
This action command causes the TA to get audio data from a source determined
by the +VLS command, and send it to the computer. Once the datastream has
started, any result codes will be embedded in the data and shielded using the
normal \ methods. The receive process is terminated when the computer
sends any command to the TA, or by time‑out of the inactivity timer. The
command is write only.

Command Return +VRX CONNECT

## C.2.10 Select compression method +VSM
This selects the voice compression method \, the voice sampling rate
\, the silence compression sensitivity \, and a parameter related to
silence expansion \. There are several choices of compression method.
IS‑101 does not specify methods, but here is a list of some usual compression
methods:
[Name Communications system]{.underline}
GSM/full‑rate GSM
GSM/half‑rate GSM
ADPCM/G.721 DECT, CT2
ADPCM/G.723 DECT, CT2
ADPCM/G.726 DECT, CT2
ADPCM/G.727 DECT, CT2
SIGNED PCM POTS
Table C.17: +VSM
* * *
Command Return +VSM=\,\,\,\  
+VSM? \,\,\,\ +VSM=? _complex; refer IS‑101_
* * *
NOTE: A value of \=0 implies no silence compression sensitivity. A value
of \=0 implies no silence expansion.
## C.2.11 DTMF and tone generation +VTS
This command allows the transmission of DTMF tones and arbitrary tones (see
note). These tones may be used (for example) when announcing the start of a
recording period. The command is write only. In this profile of commands, this
command does not operate in data or fax modes of operation (+FCLASS=0,1,2‑7).
NOTE 1: D is used only for dialling.
The string parameter of the command consists of combinations of the following
separated by commas:
1\. \. A single ASCII character in the set 0‑9, #,*,A‑D. This is
interpreted as a single ACSII character whose duration is set by the +VTD
command.
NOTE 2: In GSM this operates only in voice mode.
2\. [\,\,\]. This is interpreted as a dual tone of
frequencies \ and \, lasting for a time \ (in 10 ms
multiples).
NOTE 3: This does not operate in GSM.
3\. {\,\}. This is interpreted as a DTMF tone of different
duration from that mandated by the +VTD command.
NOTE 4: In GSM this operates only in voice mode.
Table C.18: +VTS
* * *
Command Return +VTS=_as above_  
+VTS=? (list of supported \s),(list of supported \s) ,(list of
supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.12 Tone duration +VTD
This refers to an integer \ that defines the length of tones emitted as a
result of the +VTS command. This does not affect the D command. A value
different than zero causes a tone of duration \/10 seconds. The value zero
causes a \"manufacturer specific\" value.
Table C.19: +VTD
* * *
Command Return +VTD=\  
+VTD? \ +VTD=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
NOTE: In GSM/UMTS the value of tone duration is preset and cannot be altered.
## C.2.13 Transmit data state +VTX
This action command causes the TA to receive audio data from the computer and
send it to a destination determined by the +VLS command. Once the audio
datastream has started, commands to the TA shall be embedded in the data
stream, and shielded using the normal \ methods. The transmit process is
terminated by the use of embedded commands or by the time‑out of an inactivity
timer. It is recommended that the TA has a buffer to allow the TA to convert
potentially bursty data from the computer into synchronous data for
\"transmission\". The command is write only.
Table C.20: +VTX

Command Return +VTX CONNECT
