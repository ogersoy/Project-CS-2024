# 1 Scope
The present document is Part 16 of the Stage 3 specification for an
Application Programming Interface (API) for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardised
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the Service Broker Capability Feature (SCF)
aspects of the interface. All aspects of the Service Broker SCF are defined
here, these being:
  * Sequence Diagrams
  * Class Diagrams
  * Interface specification plus detailed method descriptions
  * State Transition diagrams
  * Data definitions
  * IDL Description of the interfaces
  * WSDL Description of the interfaces
The process by which this task is accomplished is through the use of object
modelling techniques described by the Unified Modelling Language (UML).
This specification has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and the Parlay Group, in co-operation with a number of JAINâ„¢ Community
member companies.
Maintenance of up to 3GPP Rel-8 and new OSA Stage 1, 2 and 3 work beyond Rel-9
was moved to OMA in June 2008.

# 4 Service Broker SCF
The following clauses describe each aspect of the Service Broker Capability
Feature (SCF).
The order is as follows:
  * The Sequence diagrams give the reader a practical idea of how each SCF is implemented.
  * The Class relationships clause show how each of the interfaces applicable to the SCF, relate to one another.
  * The Interface specification clause describes in detail each of the interfaces shown within the Class diagram part.
  * The State Transition Diagrams (STD) show the transition between states in the SCF. The states and transitions are well-defined; either methods specified in the Interface specification or events occurring in the underlying networks cause state transitions.
The Data Definitions clause show a detailed expansion of each of the data
types associated with the methods within the classes. Note that some data
types are used in other methods and classes and are therefore defined within
the Common Data types part of this specification.
## 4.1 General requirements on support of methods
An implementation of this API which supports or implements a method described
in the present document, shall support or implement the functionality
described for that method, for at least one valid set of values for the
parameters of that method.
Where a method is not supported by an implementation of a Service interface,
the exception P_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED shall be returned to any call of that
method.
Where a method is not supported by an implementation of an Application
interface, a call to that method shall be possible, and no exception shall be
returned.
# 5 Sequence Diagrams
There are no Sequence Diagrams for the Service Broker SCF.

# 7 The Service Interface Specifications
## 7.1 Interface Specification Format
This clause defines the interfaces, methods and parameters that form a part of
the API specification. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is used to specify
the interface classes. The general format of an interface specification is
described below.
### 7.1.1 Interface Class
This shows a UML interface class description of the methods supported by that
interface, and the relevant parameters and types. The Service and Framework
interfaces for enterprise-based client applications are denoted by classes
with name Ip\. The callback interfaces to the applications are denoted
by classes with name IpApp\. For the interfaces between a Service and
the Framework, the Service interfaces are typically denoted by classes with
name IpSvc\, while the Framework interfaces are denoted by classes with
name IpFw\.
### 7.1.2 Method descriptions
Each method (API method "call") is described. Both synchronous and
asynchronous methods are used in the API. Asynchronous methods are identified
by a \'Req\' suffix for a method request, and, if applicable, are served by
asynchronous methods identified by either a \'Res\' or \'Err\' suffix for
method results and errors, respectively. To handle responses and reports, the
application or service developer must implement the relevant IpApp\ or
IpSvc\ interfaces to provide the callback mechanism.
### 7.1.3 Parameter descriptions
Each method parameter and its possible values are described. Parameters
described as \'in\' represent those that must have a value when the method is
called. Those described as \'out\' are those that contain the return result of
the method when the method returns.
### 7.1.4 State Model
If relevant, a state model is shown to illustrate the states of the objects
that implement the described interface.
## 7.2 Base Interface
### 7.2.1 Interface Class IpInterface
All application, framework and service interfaces inherit from the following
interface. This API Base Interface does not provide any additional methods.
+-------------------+ | \> | | | | IpInterface | +-------------------+ | | +-------------------+ | | +-------------------+
## 7.3 Service Interfaces
### 7.3.1 Overview
The Service Interfaces provide the interfaces into the capabilities of the
underlying network - such as call control, user interaction, messaging,
mobility and connectivity management.
The interfaces that are implemented by the services are denoted as \'Service
Interface\'. The corresponding interfaces that must be implemented by the
application (e.g. for API callbacks) are denoted as \'Application Interface\'.
## 7.4 Generic Service Interface
### 7.4.1 Interface Class IpService
Inherits from: IpInterface
.All service interfaces inherit from the following interface.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpService | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | setCallback (appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef) : void | | | | setCallbackWithSessionID (appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef, | | sessionID : in TpSessionID) : void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
#### 7.4.1.1 Method setCallback()
This method specifies the reference address of the callback interface that a
service uses to invoke methods on the application. It is not allowed to invoke
this method on an interface that uses SessionIDs. Multiple invocations of this
method on an interface shall result in multiple callback references being
specified. The SCS shall use the most recent callback interface provided by
the application using this method. In the event that a callback reference
fails or is no longer available, the next most recent callback reference
available shall be used.
Parameters
appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef
Specifies a reference to the application interface, which is used for
callbacks
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
#### 7.4.1.2 Method setCallbackWithSessionID()
This method specifies the reference address of the application\'s callback
interface that a service uses for interactions associated with a specific
session ID: e.g. a specific call, or call leg. It is not allowed to invoke
this method on an interface that does not use SessionIDs. Multiple invocations
of this method on an interface shall result in multiple callback references
being specified. The SCS shall use the most recent callback interface provided
by the application using this method. In the event that a callback reference
fails or is no longer available, the next most recent callback reference
available shall be used.
Parameters
appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef
Specifies a reference to the application interface, which is used for
callbacks
sessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the session for which the service can invoke the application\'s
callback interface.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
# 8 Service Broker Interface Classes
The Service Broker SCF enables the application to register its interest in
particular traffic as part of service interactions. The Service Broker service
provides a SCF interface that is called IpServiceBroker. There is no need for
an application interface, since IpServiceBroker only contains two synchronous
methods registerServiceInteraction and unregisterServiceInteraction.
## 8.1 Interface Class IpServiceBroker
Inherits from: IpService.
The ServiceBroker SCF interface IpServiceBroker contains two synchronous
methods, registerServiceInteraction and unregisterServiceInteraction. The
application has to provide its name, endpoint address and optionally a service
identifier as input to the registerServiceInteraction method. The result
indicates whether or not the service brokering scenario is available in the
Service Broker SCF and, in case they are, it will return an assignment
identifier in order to identify the particular interworking scenario. An
application may register multiple times with the same clientBrokerID. This is
to facilitate, though not mandate, load sharing to be possible and the ability
of two or more instances of an application to be involved in service
interworking. Moreover, the same application may register with the service
broker using more than one clientBrokerID to facilitate partitioning of
services among subscribers.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpServiceBroker | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | registerServiceInteraction (clientBrokerID : in TpString, | | endpointAddress : in TpEndpointAddress, serviceKey : in | | TpServiceKey) : TpAssignmentID | | | | unregisterServiceInteraction (assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID) : | | void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
### 8.1.1 Method registerServiceInteraction()
This method is used by an application or SCF to register interest in a
particular service interaction which has already been provisioned on the
Service Broker entity.
The method may be called multiple times for individual instances of the same
application or service i.e. individual instances using the same
clientBrokerID. The behaviour of the Service Broker SCF for this scenario is
regarded as implementation detail but may include such behaviour as round
robining of traffic to the applications or services identified by the
clientBrokerId or implementing a primary/secondary hot standby traffic
distribution for high availability.
The method may also be called multiple times by the same application instances
but each identified by a unique clientBrokerID, in order to facilitate
partitioning of subscribers. For example, where multiple charging platforms
have been provisioned by subscriber number.
If two applications attempt to call registerServiceInteraction() with the same
clientBrokerID but on different service managers then a P_INVALID_CRITERIA
exception will be returned.
Returns assignmentID: Specifies an instance of a registered service
interaction. This is used by the application in order to unregister the
service interaction at a later stage. If the service or application calls
registerServiceInteraction() multiple times with the same clientBrokerID,
endpointAddress and serviceKey then the service Broker SCF will return the
same assignmentID.
The method will return an unique assignmentID for each invocation of the
registerServiceInteraction() method specified with an unique clientBrokerID.
A P_INVALID_SERVICE_INTERACTION is returned if the Service Broker entity has
no prior knowledge of the service or application.
Parameters
clientBrokerID : in TpString
Identifies the name of the service or application requiring service
interaction.
endpointAddress : in TpEndpointAddress
Identifies the network address of the service or application. This is to allow
the Service Broker SCF to direct network traffic to the service or application
at a later stage.
serviceKey : in TpServiceKey
Identifies the service for which applications require service interaction.
Service interactions may be grouped or assigned by a single service key. This
parameter is optional; if the application does not use this parameter then its
value will be assigned NULL by the application.
Returns
TpAssignmentID
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SERVICE_INTERACTION, P_INVALID_CRITERIA
### 8.1.2 Method unregisterServiceInteraction()
This method is used by a service or application to unregister previously
registered service interactions on the Service Broker SCF.
As a result of calling this method, the service or application will no longer
receive network traffic from the Service Broker SCF for that service
interaction identified by the specific assignmentID. However, if the service
or application has previously called registerServiceInteraction() more than
once then it may still receive network traffic. In order to completely
unregister from all service interactions, the service or applications must
call unregisterServiceInteraction() for each previously allocated
assignmentID.
The method returns P_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_ID if the supplied assignmentID value
does not correspond to a previously returned assignmentID value via the
registerServiceInteraction() method.
Parameters
assignmentID : in TpAssignmentID
Identifies the specific service interaction
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_ID
