# 1 Scope
IMS Centralized Services (ICS) enable the delivery of IM CN subsystem based
multimedia telephony and supplementary services as defined in 3GPP TS 24.173
[4] to users regardless of the attached access network type; e.g. CS domain
access or IP-CAN.
The present document specifies the principles of interworking between the IM
CN subsystem and CS domain in order to enable ICS for UEs using CS domain
access.
The present document addresses the area of registration procedures
interworking between the CS domain and IM CN subsystem.

# 4 Interworking overview
## 4.1 Interworking reference model
Figure 4.1.1 details the reference model required to support interworking
between the 3GPP IM CN subsystem and CS domain access for IM basic voice calls
and supplementary services.
{width="4.688194444444444in" height="2.6979166666666665in"}
NOTE 1: The logical split of the signalling and bearer path between the CS
access network and MSC Server enhanced for ICS is as shown; however, the
signalling and bearer may be directly connected to the MGW.
NOTE 2: The CS-MGW may be connected via the Mb reference point to various
network entities, such as a UE (via a GTP tunnel to a GGSN), an MRFP, or an
IMS-MGW, or a remote CS-MGW.
Figure 4.1.1: MSC Server -- IM CN subsystem interworking reference model
## 4.2 Interworking reference points and interfaces
The reference points and network interfaces shown in figure 4.1.1 are as
described:
**A reference point: The** A reference point is defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [6].
**IuCS reference point: The** IuCS reference point is defined in 3GPP TS
23.002 [6].
**I2 reference point:** The call control protocol specified in this document
for use on the I2 reference point (i.e. between MSC Server enhanced for ICS
and CSCF) is based on Mw reference point as defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [6] and
the 3GPP profile of SIP as defined in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
**Mc reference point:** The Mc reference point is defined in 3GPP TS 23.002
[6].
**Mb reference point:** The Mb reference point is defined 3GPP TS 23.002 [6].
## 4.3 Interworking functional entities
### 4.3.1 MSC Server enhanced for ICS
This is the component which provides the interworking between CS domain access
and IM CN subsystem control planes, and it shall support the functions as
defined in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.002 [6].
For brevity, where the term \"MSC Server\" is used in the rest of the
specification, this shall be understood as \"MSC Server enhanced for ICS\".
### 4.3.2 Circuit Switched Media Gateway Function (CS-MGW)
This is the component which provides the interworking between CS domain access
and IM CN subsystem user planes, and it shall support the functions as defined
in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.002 [6].
## 4.4 Control plane interworking
Within the IM CN subsystem, the 3GPP profile of SIP defined in 3GPP TS 24.229
[2] is used for session control.
Over CS domain access, NAS signalling is used for call origination, call
termination and supplementary services.
Therefore, in order to provide the required interworking to enable ICS for UE
using CS domain access, the control plane protocols shall be interworked
within the MSC Server.
## 4.5 User plane interworking
Within the IM CN subsystem, framing protocols such as RTP are used to
transport media packets to and from IM CN subsystem entities such as the UE,
MRFP or IMS-MGW.
CS domain access uses circuit switched bearer channels like TDM circuits (e.g.
64kbits PCM), ATM/AAL2 circuits or IP bearers using the IuFP framing protocol
or RTP to carry voice frames.
Therefore, in order to provide the required interworking to enable ICS for a
UE using CS domain access, the user plane protocols shall be interworked
within the CS-MGW, under the control of the MSC Server.
# 5 Control plane procedures and interworking
## 5.1 General
The following clauses define the procedures and signalling interworking
performed by the MSC Server to enable ICS for UEs attached to the CS domain.
The interworking between NAS signalling and the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) with its associated Session Description Protocol (SDP) is specified.
The capabilities of SIP and SDP that are interworked with NAS signalling are
defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
Table 5.1.1 lists the service interworking within the scope of the present
document.

## 5.2 IMS registration procedures interworking
### 5.2.1 Initial registration
Upon successful completion of the location updating procedure as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [3], an MSC Server supporting the ICS Indicator parameter as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.002 [20] shall determine whether to perform initial
IMS registration on behalf of the UE.
The relevant location update case, when an initial registration is needed to
the IM CN subsystem is a location update to new MSC/VLR service area (the
MSC/VLR was not the previous serving network element).
In accordance with 3GPP TS 23.292 [5], clause 7.2.1.1, the MSC Server may
perform an initial IMS registration. The optional flag referred to in clause
7.2.1.1 of 3GPP TS 23.292 [5] is implemented as the ICS Indicator parameter in
3GPP TS 29.002 [20].
When performing initial IMS registration, the MSC Server shall send a REGISTER
request on behalf of the UE as described in 3GPP TS 24.292 [7].
### 5.2.2 Reregistration
The MSC Server shall initiate reregistration for a previously registered
Public User Identity as described in 3GPP TS 24.292 [7] if that subscriber is
still registered in the MSC Server via CS domain access.
### 5.2.3 MSC Server initiated deregistration
The MSC Server shall send a REGISTER request for deregistration on behalf of
the UE as described in 3GPP TS 24.292 [7] upon receipt of any indication that
the subscriber is no longer registered in this MSC Server.
Prior to sending a REGISTER request for deregistration, the MSC Server shall
release all IMS dialogs related to the Public User Identity that is going to
be deregistered or to one of the implicitly registered Public User Identities.
## 5.3 Interworking of mobile originating call setup from NAS signalling to
SIP
### 5.3.1 General
The mobile originating call shall be established in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.018 [8] and 3GPP TS 24.008 [3]. The IM CN subsystem originating session
shall be established in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.292 [7] and 3GPP TS 24.229
[2]. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for
interworking between NAS signalling and SIP.
The following clauses also assume the originating call is received from a
subscriber with an active IM CN subsystem registration via the MSC Server
performing the interworking.
### 5.3.2 Receipt of a setup message
Upon receipt of a setup message (a SETUP message or an EMERGENCY SETUP
message), the MSC Server shall determine whether the originating call shall be
directed to the IM CN subsystem.
The originating call shall be directed to the IM CN subsystem if all of the
following conditions are met:
\- the setup message is a SETUP message and is determined by the MSC Server
not to be an emergency call, and
\- the bearer capability 1 information element indicates teleservice 11 as
described in 3GPP TS 22.003 [9], and
\- the CTM text telephony indication in the bearer capability 1 information
element is set to \"CTM text telephony is not supported\", and
\- the bearer capability 2 information element is not present.
Otherwise the originating call shall be handled by the MSC Server without
interworking to the IM CN subsystem.
### 5.3.3 Sending of INVITE
#### 5.3.3.1 General
Upon determining that an incoming SETUP message shall be interworked to the IM
CN subsystem, the MSC Server shall generate an INVITE request as further
detailed in the clauses below.
#### 5.3.3.2 Coding of INVITE
The INVITE request shall be coded as described in 3GPP TS 24.292 [7] with the
following SETUP message interworking applied:
\- The called party BCD number information element in the SETUP message is
used to derive the Request URI of the INVITE request as follows:
\- if the type of number field is set to \"international number\", then the
number digit fields, prefixed with a \"+\", shall be used to build a tel URI
or a SIP URI with \"user=phone\"; or
\- if the type of number field is set to \"national number\", then the MSC
Server shall either:
\- convert the number to international format by prefixing the number digits
with \"+CC\" and use this to build a tel URI or a SIP URI with \"user=phone\";
or
NOTE 1: CC is the country code of the network in which the MSC Server is
located.
\- use the number digit fields to build a tel URI or a SIP URI with
\"user=phone\". The phone-context parameter shall include the home network
domain name defined for IMS centralized services in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10]. For
geo-local numbers, the home domain name shall be prefixed by the \"geo-local\"
string according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
NOTE 2: The manner in which the MSC Server distinguishes between geo-local and
home-local numbers is implementation specific.
\- if the type of number field is set to \"unknown\", then the MSC Server
shall build a SIP URI with \"user=phone\" or a tel URI, including the received
digits as an unprocessed dial string to the IM CN subsystem, using one of the
formats for UEs without dial string processing capabilities, as defined in
3GPP TS 24.229 [2], clause 5.1.2A.1.3;
NOTE 3: This sets the requirement that the dialling plan is designed so it
enables the IM CN subsystem to differentiate local numbers from other numbers;
refer to clause 5.1.2A.1.3.
\- if the CLIR invocation information element is present in the SETUP message,
the From header shall be set to an Anonymous User Identity as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.003 [10] and the MSC Server shall include a Privacy header with priv-
value set to \"id\";
\- if the CLIR suppression information element is present in the SETUP
message, the MSC Server shall include a Privacy header with priv-value set to
\"none\";
\- if the CLIR invocation information element and CLIR suppression information
element are not present in the SETUP message, the MSC Server shall not include
a Privacy header;
\- the P-Asserted-Identity header shall be set to the default public identity
received during registration procedures;
\- the Contact header shall be set to:
\- the public GRUU received at registration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[2]; or
\- if the CLIR suppression information element is present in the SETUP message
to the temporary GRUU received at registration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[2].
When a SIP URI is used for the Request URI, the host portion of the SIP URI
shall be set to the home network domain name defined for IMS centralized
services in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10].
If the MSC server supports the P-Early-Media header field as a network option,
then it shall include the header in each outgoing SIP INVITE request.
The MSC Server shall include a P-Charging-Vector header field in the initial
INVITE request with an \"icid-value\" header field parameter as specified in
3GPP TS 32.260 [48].
#### 5.3.3.3 Coding of the SDP offer
The MSC Server shall determine the speech codecs supported by the UE as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] and use this information when constructing a
codec list for the SDP offer. The MSC Server may also add speech codecs. The
added speech codecs are based on configuration data in the MSC Server.
If the access bearer establishment has been initiated prior to the sending of
the INVITE request (e.g. no speech codec or one speech codec is indicated from
the originating UE) the MSC Server shall indicate that preconditions have been
met in the initial SDP offer. The MSC Server may indicate in the bearer
establishment procedure to the UE the speech codec the UE shall use.
If access side bearer establishment has not been performed prior to sending
the INVITE request, the MSC Server shall indicate that preconditions have not
been met in the SDP offer. Once access side bearer establishment has been
performed, the MSC Server shall indicate that preconditions have been met in a
new SDP offer in a subsequent UPDATE or PRACK request.
#### 5.3.3.4 Actions on the SDP answer
At the receipt of the SDP answer the MSC Server shall analyse the received
speech codecs:
\- If the received speech codecs in the SDP answer do not include any of the
speech codecs provided by the UE in the SETUP message or the SDP answer only
include the default speech codec the MSC Server shall instruct the CS-MGW to
perform transcoding and indicate in the bearer establishment procedure to the
UE the speech codec the UE shall use. Which of the codecs used is based on
local policy;
\- if only one speech codec is received in the SDP answer, the MSC Server
shall select that speech codec and may indicate the speech codec in the bearer
establishment procedure to the UE;
\- if more than one speech codec is received in the SDP answer the MSC Server
shall select one codec based on local configuration and may indicate the
speech codec in the bearer establishment procedure to the UE; and send a new
SDP offer which shall indicate the speech codec that the MSC Server has
selected.
For UTRAN and GERAN Iu-mode, the NAS Synchronisation Indicator information
element shall be used to inform the UE of the selected codec as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [3].
### 5.3.4 Sending of ALERTING
The MSC Server shall send an ALERTING message towards the UE upon receiving
the first 180 Ringing response.
### 5.3.4a Sending of PROGRESS
Once all the following conditions have been met:
1) the MSC server supports the P-Early-Media header field, and received the
first SIP 183 Session Progress response that includes a P-Early-Media header
field authorizing backward early media;
2) SDP preconditions are not used, or applicable SDP preconditions have been
met; and
3) the MSC server did not receive a SIP 180 Ringing response;
the MSC server shall send a PROGRESS message.
### 5.3.4b Through-Connecting early media from IMS
If a SIP 18x response is received by the MSC server, once all the following
conditions have been met:
1) the MSC server supports the P-Early-Media header field, and the response
includes a P-Early-Media header field authorizing backward early media; and
2) SDP preconditions are not used, or applicable SDP preconditions have been
met;
the MSC server shall instruct the CS-MGW to through-connect as described in
clause 7.1.5 for early media from the IMS side unless the CS-MGW has already
been through-connected.
### 5.3.5 Applying ringback tone
The MSC Server shall instruct the CS-MGW to apply ringback tone towards the UE
in the following conditions:
\- a 180 Ringing response is received and either:
\- the MSC Server does not support the P-Early-Media header as a network
option; or
\- the MSC Server supports the P-Early-Media header as a network option and
according to IETF RFC 5009 [47] backward early media is not authorized (the
most recently received P-Early-Media header does not authorize backward early
media or the P-Early-Media header has not yet been received).
### 5.3.6 Receipt of 200 OK (INVITE)
Upon receipt of the first 200 OK (INVITE) response, the MSC Server shall:
\- instruct the CS-MGW to stop ringback if ringback was previously applied;
and
\- instruct the CS-MGW to through-connect the bearer in both directions; and
\- send a CONNECT message towards the UE as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3].
Interworking applied for the TIP service is described in clause 5.6.2.1.
The MSC Server shall not progress any further early dialogs to established
dialogs. Therefore, upon receipt of a subsequent 200 OK final response to the
initial INVITE request (e.g. due to forking), the MSC Server shall:
\- acknowledge the response with an ACK request; and
\- send a BYE request to this dialog in order to terminate it.
### 5.3.7 Receipt of status-codes 3xx
Upon receipt of a 3xx response to the initial INVITE, the default behaviour of
the MSC Server shall be to release the call with a cause code value of 127
(Interworking unspecified).
NOTE: The MSC Server may also decide to redirect the call toward the URI in
the Contact header field of the 3xx response, as an operator option. Such
handling is outside the scope of the present document.
### 5.3.8 Receipt of status-codes 4xx, 5xx or 6xx
If the MSC Server receives a 4xx, 5xx or 6xx SIP response to the initial SIP
INVITE request and the MSC Server has not sent a SIP CANCEL request, the MSC
Server shall initiate call clearing procedures by sending a CC DISCONNECT
message towards the UE as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] with the following
interworking applied:
1) If one or more Reason header fields are included in the 4xx, 5xx or 6xx SIP
response, then the cause value of each Reason header field shall be mapped to
a cause information element in the CC DISCONNECT message as follows:
a) if the Reason header field contains a Q.850 cause value, the numeric
\"cause\" parameter value shall be mapped to the cause value octet of the
cause information element in the CC DISCONNECT message according to table
5.3.8.2;
b) if the Reason header field contains a SIP status-code, the coding of the
cause information element in the CC DISCONNECT message shall be as follows:
\- set the coding standard to \"Standard defined for the GSM PLMNs\";
\- set the location to \"network beyond interworking point\"; and
\- derive the cause value from the SIP status-code received in the Reason
header field according to table 5.3.8.1. The 4xx, 5xx, and 6xx SIP responses
that are not covered in this table shall be interworked to a cause value of
127 (Interworking, unspecified); and
c) if no Reason header field is included in the 4xx, 5xx or 6xx SIP response,
the coding of the cause information element in the CC DISCONNECT message is
derived from the SIP status-code of the SIP response according to table
5.3.8.1, where the following information elements shall be set to:
\- coding standard to \"Standard defined for the GSM PLMNs\"; and
\- location to \"network beyond interworking point\".

### 5.3.9 Receipt of DISCONNECT
If the MSC Server receives a DISCONNECT message from the UE prior to receiving
a final response to the initial INVITE, the MSC Server shall send a CANCEL
request. If a 200 OK response to the initial INVITE is received after sending
the CANCEL request, the MSC Server shall send a BYE request to the IM CN
subsystem to terminate the session.
If the DISCONNECT message contains one or more cause information elements, the
first cause information element shall be mapped to a Reason header field in
the CANCEL or BYE request as follows:
\- set the protocol field to \"Q.850\"; and
\- set the numeric \"cause\" parameter value to the cause value field of the
cause information element according to table 5.4.8.1.2.
NOTE: The inclusion of reason-text in the Reason header is implementation
specific.
### 5.3.10 Restoration procedures
If the MSC Server receives a SIP 504 (Server Time-out) response and all the
following conditions are fulfilled:
1) there is no re-registration ongoing;
2) a P-Asserted-Identity header field set to a value equal to an URI:
\- from the Service-Route header field value received during registration; or
\- from the Path header field value received during registration; and
3) the SIP response contains a Content-Type header field set to
\"application/3gpp-ims+xml\" as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] clause 7.6; and
4) the SIP response includes an IM CN subsystem XML body as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.229 [2] clause 7.6 with the \ element, including a version
attribute, with the \ child element:
\- with the \ child element set to \"restoration\" (see 3GPP TS 24.229
[2] table 7.6.2); and
\- with the \ child element set to \"initial-registration\" (see 3GPP
TS 24.229 [2] table 7.6.3);
then the MSC Server shall initiate restoration procedures by performing an
initial registration as specified in clause 5.2.1.
If the MSC Server is unsuccessful to send an initial SIP INVITE request to the
next hop determined by one of the following:
\- there is no response to the SIP INVITE request by the MSC Server; or
\- by unspecified means available to the MSC Server;
and if there is no re-registration ongoing then the MSC Server may initiate
restoration procedures by performing an initial registration as specified in
clause 5.2.1.
NOTE: If there is an ongoing re-registration and the conditions in this clause
for initiating an initial registration were fulfilled the MSC Server regards
this user as not registered and waits until a successful registration before
sending any more INVITE request for this user. Meanwhile the MSC Server can
fall back to the procedures for non ICS UE attached to a legacy MSC for call
establishment as described in 3GPP TS 23.292 [5].
## 5.4 Interworking of mobile terminating call setup from SIP to NAS
signalling
### 5.4.1 General
The IM CN susbsystem terminating session shall be established in accordance
with 3GPP TS 24.292 [7] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]. The mobile terminating call
shall be established at the visited MSC Server in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.018 [8] and 3GPP TS 24.008 [3]. The following clauses describe the
additional requirements for interworking between SIP and NAS signalling.
### 5.4.2 Receipt of initial INVITE
Upon receipt of an initial INVITE request, the MSC Server shall validate the
INVITE request and SDP offer, if present, as described in 3GPP TS 24.292 [7].
After validating the INVITE request, the terminating party shall be validated
as follows:
\- the MSC Server shall identify the terminating subscriber using the
P-Called-Party-ID header or Request-URI from the INVITE request and use this
to retrieve the VLR data;
\- if the VLR data cannot be retrieved, the MSC Server shall send a 500 Server
Internal Error response to the INVITE request;
\- if the VLR data can be retrieved, the following checks shall be performed:
\- if the IMSI is detached, the MSC Server shall send a 500 Server Internal
Error response to the INVITE request;
NOTE 1: IMSI detached status could be the result of a race condition with CS
domain access signalling which has not yet removed the IMS registration
binding for this contact address.
Upon successful validation of the terminating party, the MSC Server shall
initiate the establishment of a MM connection as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008
[3]. If a MM connection cannot be established (e.g. no PAGE RESPONSE message
is received), the MSC Server shall send a 408 Request Timeout response to the
INVITE request.
If the initial INVITE request includes a MIME body (part) according to clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 24.615 [44] with the \"communication-waiting-indication\"
element contained in the \"ims-cw\" root element according to 3GPP TS 24.615
[44], and if the MSC Server determines that the incoming call can be presented
to the subscriber as described in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26], then clause 5.6.4.1
applies.
NOTE 2: Clause 5.6.8.3.1.4 contains additional applicable procedures executed
upon receipt of an initial INVITE request if the MSC Server is as conference
participant.
The MSC Server shall store the \"icid-value\" header field parameter received
in the P-Charging-Vector header field.
### 5.4.3 Sending of SETUP
After successful MM connection establishment, the MSC Server shall send a
SETUP message as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] with the following INVITE
request interworking applied:
\- The MSC Server may include a bearer capability 1 information element set to
indicate teleservice 11 as described in 3GPP TS 22.003 [9];
\- The MSC Server shall not include a bearer capability 2 information element;
\- If a P-Asserted-Identity header containing a tel URI or a SIP URI with
\"user=phone\" is present, the MSC Server shall use this header to build a
calling party BCD number information element as follows:
\- if the tel URI or number within the SIP URI is in international format, set
the type of number to \"international number\", otherwise set the type of
number to \"national number\"; and
\- set the number plan identification to \"ISDN/telephony numbering plan\";
and
\- set the presentation indicator to \"presentation allowed\"; and
\- set the screening indicator to \"network provided\"; and
\- set the number digits fields to the telephone number contained in the tel
URI or SIP URI;
NOTE 1: If the P-Asserted-Identity header contains both a tel URI and a SIP
URI with \"user=phone\", the URI used for mapping is implementation specific.
NOTE 2: The number mapping does not include any digits contained in the phone-
context parameter.
\- If a P-Asserted-Identity header is present but does not contain a tel URI
or a SIP URI with \"user=phone\", the following applies:
\- If a display name is present in the P-Asserted-Identity header, and if no
Privacy header with priv-value set to \"id\" is present, and if the MSC Server
supports the network option of mapping display name to calling name identity,
the MSC Server may use the P-Asserted-Identity header to build a facility
information element with a name indicator parameter set to the display name.
NOTE 3: Interworking of display name received in conjunction with a tel URI or
SIP URI to calling name presentation using CNAP is subject to local regulatory
requirements on calling line identity and whether the originating network of
the call is trusted to provide an authentic identity.
\- If no display name is present in any P-Asserted-Identity header, or if the
MSC Server does not support the network option of mapping a display name to
calling name identity, the MSC Server shall build a calling party BCD number
information element as follows:
\- set the type of number to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the number plan identification to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the presentation indicator to \"number not available due to
interworking\"; and
\- set the screening indicator to \"network provided\"; and
\- do not include any number digits fields;
\- If no P-Asserted-Identity header is present but a Privacy header with priv-
value set to \"id\" is present, the MSC Server shall build a calling party BCD
number information element as follows:
\- set the type of number to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the number plan identification to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the presentation indicator to \"presentation restricted\"; and
\- set the screening indicator to \"network provided\"; and
\- do not include any number digits fields;
\- If neither a P-Asserted-Identity header nor a Privacy header field with a
priv-value set to \"id\" is present, then the MSC Server shall include no
calling party BCD number information element.
\- If a P-Asserted-Identity header containing a tel URI or a SIP URI with
\"user=phone\" and a Privacy header with priv-value set to \"id\" are present,
the MSC Server shall build a calling party BCD number information element as
follows:
\- set the type of number to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the number plan identification to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the presentation indicator to \"presentation restricted\"; and
\- set the screening indicator to \"network provided\"; and
\- do not include any number digits fields.
### 5.4.4 Receipt of CALL CONFIRMED
Upon receipt of a CALL CONFIRMED message:
\- if a bearer capabilities 1 information element is present and indicates a
teleservice other than 11 as described in 3GPP TS 22.003 [9], the MSC Server
shall initiate call clearing procedures using a cause value of 58 (bearer
capability not presently available);
\- if a bearer capabilities 1 information element is present and includes a
CTM text telephony indication set to \"CTM text telephony is supported\", the
default behaviour of the MSC Server shall be to continue with call setup but
not to provide user plane interworking between CTM and RTP-text at the CS-MGW.
NOTE: Conversion between CTM as described in 3GPP TS 26.226 [22] and RTP-text
as described in 3GPP TS 26.235 [21] may be provided as an implementation
option if the SDP offer included the payload type for RTP-text. Such
conversion is outside the scope of the present document.
### 5.4.5 Bearer establishment
#### 5.4.5.1 Network side bearer establishment
If the initial INVITE request contained an SDP offer, the MSC Server should
use the codecs received in the SDP offer and determine the codecs supported by
the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] to select and return a single codec
in the SDP answer.
The MSC Server shall reject all non-audio media descriptions from the SDP
offer in the SDP answer.
The SDP answer shall be returned in the first reliable response.
If the initial INVITE request did not contain an SDP offer, the MSC Server
should determine the codecs supported by the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008
[3] and use this information when constructing a codec list for the SDP offer
and send the SDP offer in the first reliable response to the INVITE request.
#### 5.4.5.2 Access bearer assignment
The MSC Server shall initiate access bearer assignment only after the
following conditions are satisfied:
\- the incoming side RTP connection point has been successfully reserved and
configured in the CS-MGW; and
\- either:
\- preconditions were not requested in the SDP of the initial INVITE request;
or
\- an SDP offer has been received indicating that remote preconditions have
been met.
For UTRAN and GERAN Iu-mode, the NAS Synchronisation Indicator information
element shall be used to inform the UE of the selected codec as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [3].
#### 5.4.5.3 Transcoding
The CS-MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
### 5.4.6 Receipt of ALERTING
Upon receipt of the ALERTING message from the UE, the MSC Server shall send a
180 Ringing response.
NOTE: Starting timer T301 (or a corresponding internal alerting supervision
timing function) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] at the MSC Server is an
implementation option. The default value for T301 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] is
longer than the range specified for the IM CN subsystem\'s no reply timer
specified in 3GPP TS 24.604 [23], which should allow the IM CN subsystem to
properly control CFNA. However, if T301 is started and expires prior to the no
reply timer in the IM CN subsystem, the non-2xx response returned to the IM CN
subsystem will prevent invocation of the CFNA service.
### 5.4.7 Applying early media
The MSC Server may instruct the CS-MGW to apply ringback tone or an
announcement towards the IM CN subsystem in the following condition:
\- the MSC Server supports the P-Early-Media header as a network option; and
\- the P-Early-Media header was received in the initial INVITE request.
If these conditions are met and the MSC Server chooses to apply early media,
the following actions are taken:
\- prior to applying an announcement, the MSC Server shall include in the 183
Session Progress response a P-Early-Media header authorizing backward early
media;
\- prior to applying ringback tone, the MSC Server shall include in the 180
Ringing response a P-Early-Media header authorizing backward early media.
### 5.4.8 Call rejection or abandonment
#### 5.4.8.1 Receipt of RELEASE COMPLETE or DISCONNECT
If the MSC Server receives a RELEASE COMPLETE or DISCONNECT message from the
UE during call establishment, the MSC Server shall send a status-code 4xx, 5xx
or 6xx response to the initial INVITE. The status-code sent shall be
determined by examining the first cause information element received in the
RELEASE COMPLETE or DISCONNECT message and applying the mapping specified in
table 5.4.8.1.1.
Table 5.4.8.1.1: Mapping the cause information element to the 4xx/5xx/6xx

NOTE 1: Alternative mappings are allowed per operator policy.
The first cause information element included in the RELEASE COMPLETE or
DISCONNECT message shall be mapped to a Reason header field in the SIP final
response sent as a result of this clause as follows:
\- set the protocol field to \"Q.850\"; and
\- set the numeric \"cause\" parameter value to the cause value field of the
cause information element according to table 5.4.8.1.2.
NOTE 2: The inclusion of reason-text in the Reason header is implementation
specific.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
#### 5.4.8.2 Receipt of CANCEL or BYE
If the MSC Server receives a CANCEL or BYE request, the MSC Server shall
initiate call clearing procedures by sending a DISCONNECT message towards the
UE as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] with the following interworking applied:
\- If one or more Reason headers is included in the CANCEL or BYE request,
then the cause value of each Reason header shall be mapped to a cause
information element in the DISCONNECT message as follows:
\- if the Reason header contains a Q.850 cause value or a SIP status-code, the
cause information element shall be built as described in clause 5.3.8.
\- if no Reason header is included in the CANCEL or BYE request, a cause value
set to 31 (normal, unspecified) , coding standard set to \"Standard defined
for the GSM PLMNs\" and location set to \"network beyond interworking point\"
shall be used in the cause information element in the DISCONNECT message.
### 5.4.9 Receipt of CONNECT
Upon receipt of the CONNECT message from the UE, the MSC Server shall send a
200 OK response to the initial INVITE.
Interworking applied for the TIR services is described in clause 5.6.2.2.
### 5.4.10 Call failure procedures
The MSC Server shall handle call failures (e.g. timer expiration) during
mobile terminating call establishment in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.008 [3].
The cause value used towards the calling user as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008
[3] shall be mapped to a final response to the INVITE request as specified in
clause 5.4.8.1.
## 5.5 Interworking of established call clearing between NAS signalling and
SIP
### 5.5.1 General
The following clauses define the procedure and signalling interworking
performed by the MSC Server for call clearing of an established call. This
interworking is independent of the direction of original call establishment.
Call clearing during call setup is described in clauses 5.3.7, 5.3.8, 5.3.9,
5.4.8.1 and 5.4.10.
### 5.5.2 Clearing initiated by the mobile
MSC Server handling of call clearing initiated by the mobile shall be in
accordance with 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] with the additional interworking defined
here.
Upon receipt of a DISCONNECT message, the MSC Server shall send a BYE request
to the IM CN subsystem. The cause information element in the DISCONNECT
message shall be mapped to a Reason header in the BYE request according to in
clause 5.4.8.1.
### 5.5.3 Clearing initiated by the IM CN subsystem
Upon receipt of a BYE request, the MSC Server shall send a DISCONNECT message
towards the mobile. If one or more Reason header fields is included in the BYE
request, each Reason header field shall be mapped to a cause information
element in the DISCONNECT message according to clause 5.3.8.
If no Reason header is present, a cause information element value of 16
(Normal call clearing) shall be used.
### 5.5.4 Autonomous clearing initiated by the MSC Server
If the MSC Server determines due to internal procedures that the call shall be
released, call release shall be in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] with the
additional interworking defined here.
The MSC Server shall send a BYE request to the IM CN subsystem. The MSC Server
shall align according to table 5.4.8.1.2 the value used in the cause
information element in the DISCONNECT message with the value used in the
\"cause\" parameter for the \"Q.850\" protocol field in the Reason header of
the BYE request.
## 5.6 Supplementary Services invocation
### 5.6.1 Originating identification presentation/restriction (OIP/OIR)
The interworking required for OIP is defined in clause 5.4.3.
The interworking required for OIR is defined in clause 5.3.3.2.
### 5.6.2 Terminating identification presentation/restriction (TIP/TIR)
#### 5.6.2.1 Terminating identification presentation (TIP)
When interworking a SIP 200 OK (INVITE) response to a CONNECT message as
described in clause 5.3.6, a MSC Server which supports the normal operation of
the connected number supplementary service as described in 3GPP TS 24.081 [12]
shall apply the following interworking for the TIP supplementary service:
\- if a P-Asserted-Identity header containing a tel URI or a SIP URI with
\"user=phone\" is present, the MSC Server shall use this header to build a
connected number information element as follows:
\- if the tel URI or number within the userinfo part of the SIP URI is in
international format, set the type of number to \"international number\",
otherwise set the type of number to \"national number\"; and
\- set the number plan identification to \"ISDN/telephony numbering plan\";
and
\- set the presentation indicator to \"presentation allowed\"; and
\- set the screening indicator to \"network provided\"; and
\- set the number digits fields to the telephone number contained in the tel
URI or the userinfo part of the SIP URI; or
NOTE 1: If the P-Asserted-Identity header contains both a tel URI and a SIP
URI with \"user=phone\", the URI used for mapping is implementation specific.
NOTE 2: The number mapping does not include any digits contained in the phone-
context parameter.
\- if a P-Asserted-Identity header is present but does not contain a tel URI
or a SIP URI with \"user=phone\", the MSC Server shall build a connected
number information element as follows:
\- set the type of number to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the number plan identification to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the presentation indicator to \"number not available due to
interworking\"; and
\- set the screening indicator to \"network provided\"; and
\- do not include any number digits fields; or
\- if no P-Asserted-Identity header is present but a Privacy header with priv-
value set to \"id\" is present, the MSC Server shall build a connected number
information element as follows:
\- set the type of number to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the number plan identification to \"unknown\"; and
\- set the presentation indicator to \"presentation restricted\"; and
\- set the screening indicator to \"network provided\"; and
\- do not include any number digits fields; or
\- if neither a P-Asserted-Identity header nor a Privacy header field with a
priv-value set to \"id\" is present, then no connected number information
element shall be included.
#### 5.6.2.2 Terminating identification restriction (TIR)
The MSC Server shall not include a Privacy header in any response to an INVITE
request.
NOTE: 3GPP TS 24.081 [12] does not provide a mechanism for a terminator to
temporarily override default settings for this service. The inclusion of a
Privacy header could lead to the AS serving the terminating user to mistakenly
assume that a default setting is being temporarily overridden by the
terminating user. Omitting the Privacy header allows the AS supporting the
terminating user to perform the appropriate actions for the TIR service in
\"permanent mode\" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.608 [14].
### 5.6.3 Communication Hold (HOLD)
#### 5.6.3.1 HOLD initiated via NAS signalling
##### 5.6.3.1.1 Hold
When the MSC Server receives a HOLD message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.083
[26] and the media on the IM CN subsystem side of the CS-MGW is \"sendonly\"
or \"inactive\", no interworking is required and the MSC Server shall send a
HOLD ACKNOWLEDGE message to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26]. If the
media on the IM CN subsystem side is \"recvonly\" or \"sendrecv\", the MSC
Server shall send an UPDATE or re-INVITE request containing an SDP offer
configured as follows:
\- mark the media as \"sendonly\" or \"inactive\" as described in 3GPP TS
24.610 [27]; and
\- if RTCP is disabled for this media stream, include RR and RS bandwidth
modifiers with values greater than zero to enable RTCP as described in 3GPP TS
26.114 [28] clause 7.3.1.
Upon receipt of the SDP answer in a 200 OK response to the UPDATE or re-INVITE
request, the MSC Server shall send a HOLD ACKNOWLEDGE message to the UE as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26].
If the SDP offer is rejected or a non-200 response is received to the UPDATE
or re-INVITE request, the MSC Server shall send a HOLD REJECT message to the
UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26] with cause parameter set to \"Facility
rejected\".
##### 5.6.3.1.2 Resume
When the MSC Server receives a RETRIEVE message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.083
[26] and the media on the IM CN subsystem side of the CS-MGW is \"recvonly\"
or \"sendrecv\", no interworking is required and the MSC Server shall send a
RETRIEVE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26]. If
the media on the IM CN subsystem side is \"sendonly\" or \"inactive\", the MSC
Server shall send an UPDATE or re-INVITE request containing an SDP offer with
media marked as \"recvonly\" or \"sendrecv\" as described in 3GPP TS 24.610
[27]. The MSC Server may include RR and RS bandwidth modifiers set to zero in
the SDP offer to disable RTCP.
Upon receipt of the SDP answer in a 200 OK response to the UPDATE or re-INVITE
request, the MSC Server shall send a RETRIEVE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the UE as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26].
If the SDP offer is rejected or a non-200 response is received to the UPDATE
or re-INVITE request, the MSC Server shall send a RETRIEVE REJECT message to
the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26] with cause parameter set to
\"Facility rejected\".
#### 5.6.3.2 HOLD initiated via SIP signalling
##### 5.6.3.2.1 Hold
The IM CN subsystem makes a hold request by sending an UPDATE or re-INVITE
request with an \"inactive\" or \"sendonly\" SDP attribute, depending on the
current state of the session. Upon receipt of a hold request from the IM CN
subsystem, the MSC Server shall perform the following interworking:
\- if the MSC Server received a non-zero SS screening indicator as defined in
3GPP TS 24.080 [29] from the UE, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY message
indicating the call has been placed on hold as specified in 3GPP TS 24.083
[26];
\- if the MSC Server did not receive a non-zero SS screening indicator from
the UE, the MSC Server shall not send any message to the UE.
##### 5.6.3.2.2 Resume
The IM CN subsystem requests to resume a session by sending an UPDATE or re-
INVITE request with an \"recvonly\" or \"sendrecv\" SDP attribute, depending
on the current state of the session. Upon receipt of a resume request from the
IM CN subsystem, the MSC Server shall perform the following interworking:
\- if the MSC Server received a non-zero SS screening indicator as defined in
3GPP TS 24.080 [29] from the UE, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY message
indicating the call has been retrieved as specified in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26];
\- if the MSC Server did not receive a non-zero SS screening indicator from
the UE, the MSC Server shall not send any message to the UE.
### 5.6.4 Communication Waiting (CW)
#### 5.6.4.1 Receipt of initial INVITE
NOTE: Clause 5.4.2 contains general applicable procedures executed upon
receipt of an initial INVITE request.
If the initial INVITE request includes:
\- a MIME body (part) according to clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 24.615 [44] with
the \"communication-waiting-indication\" element contained in the \"ims-cw\"
root element according to 3GPP TS 24.615 [44]; or
\- does not contain a Replaces header field corresponding to a established
dialog and the target of the INVITE request is engaged in the established SIP
dialog;
then, upon interworking the initial INVITE request to a SETUP message as
described in clause 5.4.3, the MSC Server shall apply the following additional
interworking:
\- the MSC Server shall include a Signal information element with value 7
(call waiting tone on); and
\- if the INVITE request includes a MIME body (part) according to clause 4.4.1
of 3GPP TS 24.615 [44] with the \"communication-waiting-indication\" element
contained in the \"ims-cw\" root element according to 3GPP TS 24.615 [44]:
\- the MSC Server shall store an indication that this session includes a CW
AS; and
\- the MSC Server may start timer TUE-CW as described in 3GPP TS 24.615 [44].
If the CALL CONFIRMED message received by the MSC Server during mobile
terminating call setup contains a Cause information element set to a value of
17 (User busy), then upon interworking the subsequent ALERTING message to a
180 Ringing response as described in clause 5.4.6, the MSC Server shall apply
the following additional interworking:
\- the MSC Server shall insert an Alert-Info header set to
\"urn:alert:service:call-waiting\" as described in 3GPP TS 24.615 [44] into
the 180 Ringing response.
#### 5.6.4.2 Accepting the waiting call
If the subscriber chooses to accept the waiting call and put the existing call
on hold, the MSC Server shall:
\- upon receipt of the HOLD message for the existing call, apply the
interworking specified in clause 5.6.3.1.1; and
\- upon receipt of the CONNECT message for the waiting call, stop timer T~UE-
CW~ if it was started and apply the interworking specified in clause 5.4.9.
If the subscriber chooses to accept the waiting call and release the existing
call, the MSC Server shall:
\- upon receipt of the DISCONNECT message for the existing call, apply the
interworking specified in clause 5.5.2; and
\- upon receipt of the CONNECT message for the waiting call, stop timer T~UE-
CW~ if it was started and apply the interworking specified in clause 5.4.9.
#### 5.6.4.3 Rejecting the waiting call
If the MSC Server receives a first clearing message from the UE during call
establishment, the cause value used towards the calling user as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [3] shall be mapped to a final response to the INVITE request
as specified in clause 5.4.8.1, except for cause codes:
\- 19 (User alerting, no answer) and 18 (No user responding). A first clearing
message from the UE during call establishment with cause code 19 (User
alerting, no answer) or 18 (No user responding) shall be mapped to the 480
(Temporarily unavailable) final response including a Reason header field (see
RFC 3326 [45]) with the protocol set to \"Q.850\" and the cause set to \"19\"
or \"18\", respectively;
\- 63 (Service or option not available, unspecified) and 69 (Requested
facility not implemented):
\- if the MSC Server stored an indication that the session includes a CW AS, a
first clearing message from the UE during call establishment with cause code
63 (Service or option not available, unspecified) or 69 (Requested facility
not implemented) used towards the calling user as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008
[3] shall be mapped to the 415 (Unsupported Media Type) final response; or
\- if the MSC Server did not store an indication that the session includes a
CW AS, the cause codes 63 (Service or option not available, unspecified) and
69 (Requested facility not implemented) used towards the calling user as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] shall be mapped to a final response to the
INVITE request as specified in clause 5.4.8.1.
The MSC Server shall stop timer T~UE-CW~ if it was started.
#### 5.6.4.4 Communication release during waiting condition
Upon receipt of a BYE or CANCEL request for the waiting call, the MSC Server
shall stop timer T~UE-CW~ if it was started, and:
\- if the BYE or CANCEL request includes a Reason header field (see RFC 3326
[45]) with the protocol set to \"SIP\" and the cause set to \"408\" then the
MSC Server shall send a first clearing message according to clause 5.4.8.2,
with the following addition:
\- the Cause information element shall be set to cause 102 \"recovery on timer
expiry\"; or
\- the MSC Server shall act in accordance with clause 5.4.8.2.
#### 5.6.4.5 CW condition timeout
If timer T~UE-CW~ was started and expires, the MSC Server shall:
\- send a DISCONNECT message as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3], towards the
UE for the waiting call, including the Cause information element, where the
cause values is set to 102 \"recovery on timer expiry\", the coding standard
set to \"Standard defined for the GSM PLMNs\" and location set to \"network
beyond interworking point\";
\- if the MSC Server stored an indication that the session includes a CW AS,
send a 480 (Temporarily unavailable) final response, including a Reason header
field set to cause 19, according to 3GPP TS 24.615 [44] in response to the
initial INVITE request;
\- if the MSC Server did not store an indication that the session includes a
CW AS, the MSC Server shall act in accordance with clause 5.4.10.
NOTE: Starting timer T2 or (optionally) T3 (or corresponding internal alerting
supervision timing functions) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26] is an
implementation option. Corresponding timers have been defined in 3GPP TS
24.615 [44] and 3GPP TS 24.604 [23]. If timers T2 or optionally T3 are started
and expire, any resulting SIP responses that are not a 480 (Temporarily
unavailable) final response, including a Reason header field set to cause 19,
can interact with CW and (optionally) CDIV.
#### 5.6.4.6 Notification to originator
For originating calls interworked to the IM CN subsystem as described in
clause 5.3, if the MSC Server receives a 180 Ringing response with a Alert-
Info header field set to \"urn:alert:service:call-waiting\" according to 3GPP
TS 24.615 [44], the MSC Server shall, according to 3GPP TS 24.083 [26], send
if possible, the ALERTING message as the carrier message for the Call Waiting
notification. Otherwise the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY message as the
carrier message for the Call Waiting notification as specified in 3GPP TS
24.083 [26].
### 5.6.5 Communication Barring (CB)
When interworking a 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response to the initial INVITE request to
a DISCONNECT message as described in clause 5.3.8, the MSC Server shall apply
the following additional interworking for the CB services described in 3GPP TS
24.611 [31]:
\- if a 433 Anonymity Disallowed response is received, the MSC Server shall
include in the DISCONNECT a NotifySS operation containing an SS-Code set to
the common code for incoming barring services and an SS-Status set to indicate
the service is active and operative as specified in 3GPP TS 24.088 [30];
\- if a 603 Decline response is received, the MSC Server shall include in the
DISCONNECT a NotifySS operation containing an SS-Code set to the common code
for all barring services and an SS-Status set to indicate the service is
active and operative as specified in 3GPP TS 24.088 [30].
NOTE: The common SS code is used as 3GPP TS 24.611 [31] specifies the use of a
603 Decline response for both the OCB and ICB services.
### 5.6.6 Communication Diversion
#### 5.6.6.1 General
The following clauses describe the MSC Server interworking behaviour related
to the Communication Diversion (CDIV) services defined in 3GPP TS 24.604 [23].
#### 5.6.6.2 CDIV invocation
##### 5.6.6.2.1 Communication Forwarding Unconditional (CFU)
Invocation of CFU is handled by the IM CN subsystem as described in 3GPP TS
24.604 [23] and requires no interworking at the MSC Server.
##### 5.6.6.2.2 Communication Forwarding Busy (CFB)
For network determined user busy, invocation of CFB is handled by the IM CN
subsystem as described in 3GPP TS 24.604 [23] and requires interworking at the
MSC Server.
For user determined user busy during mobile terminating call establishment as
described in clause 5.4, if the MSC Server receives a DISCONNECT, RELEASE or
RELEASE COMPLETE message from the UE with a cause information element set to
\"User Busy\", the MSC Server shall perform the interworking described in
clause 5.4.8.1.
##### 5.6.6.2.3 Communication Forwarding No Reply (CFNR)
Invocation of CFNR is handled by the IM CN subsystem as described in 3GPP TS
24.604 [23] and requires no interworking at the MSC Server.
##### 5.6.6.2.4 Communication Forwarding on Not Logged-In (CFNL)
Invocation of CFNL is handled by the IM CN subsystem as described in 3GPP TS
24.604 [23] and requires no interworking at the MSC Server.
##### 5.6.6.2.5 Communication Deflection (CD)
During mobile terminating call establishment as described in clause 5.4, if
the MSC Server receives a DISCONNECT message from the UE with a facility
information element containing a call deflection request as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.072 [25], the MSC Server shall send a 302 Moved Temporarily response to
the initial INVITE with the following interworking applied:
\- the DeflectedToNumber parameter in the facility information element
received in the DISCONNECT message is used to derive a Contact header as
follows:
\- if the nature of address indicator is set to \"international number\", then
the address digits in the DeflectedToNumber parameter, prefixed with a \"+\",
shall be used to build a tel URI or a SIP URI with \"user=phone\"; or
\- if the nature of address indicator is not set to \"international number\",
then the MSC Server shall either:
\- convert the address digits in the DeflectedToNumber parameter to
international format by prefixing the number digits with \"+CC\" and use this
to build a tel URI or a SIP URI with \"user=phone\"; or
NOTE 1: CC is the country code of the network in which the MSC Server is
located.
\- use the address digits in the DeflectedToNumber parameter to build a tel
URI or a SIP URI with \"user=phone\". The phone-context parameter shall
include the home network domain name defined for IMS centralized services in
3GPP TS 23.003 [10]. For geo-local numbers, the home domain name shall be
prefixed by the \"geo-local\" string according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
NOTE 2: The manner in which the MSC Server distinguishes between geo-local and
home-local numbers is implementation specific.
##### 5.6.6.2.6 Communication Forwarding on Subscriber Not Reachable (CFNRc)
Clause 5.4.2 describes a number of scenarios where the MSC Server determines
the terminating user is not reachable prior to sending the SETUP message and
returns the appropriate response to the INVITE request to allow CFNRc to be
initiated in the IM CN subsystem. If the MSC Server determines the terminating
user is not reachable prior to sending the SETUP message for any other
scenario not described in clause 5.4.2, the MSC Server shall send a 500 Server
Internal Error response to the initial INVITE request.
#### 5.6.6.3 Notifications relating to CDIV
##### 5.6.6.3.1 Void
##### 5.6.6.3.2 Notification to an originating user on CS access
For originating calls interworked to the IM CN subsystem as described in
clause 5.3, if communication diversion occurs for a served user with the
subscription option \"Originating user receives notification that his
communication has been diverted (forwarded or deflected)\" as described in
3GPP TS 24.604 [23], the following interworking shall be applied upon receipt
of a 181 (Call Is Being Forwarded) response:
\- if a History-Info header field is present and any history entry contains a
\"cause\" SIP URI parameter, as defined in IETF RFC 4458 [49], set to a value
listed in table 5.6.6.3.2.1, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY message
containing a NotifySS operation indicating the call has been forwarded. The
NotifySS operation shall contain an SS-Code as specified in 3GPP TS 24.082
[24] and 3GPP TS 24.072 [25] mapped from the value of the last \"cause\" SIP
URI parameter according to table 5.6.6.3.2.1;
Table 5.6.6.3.2.1: Mapping the History-Info cause value to SS-Code
* * *
Cause value SS-Code 302 CFU 404 Common SS-Code for all forwarding SS 408 CFNRy

* * *
NOTE: Per 3GPP TS 24.604 [23] the History-Info header field can also be
received in a SIP 180 (Ringing) or SIP 200 (OK) response to the initial SIP
INVITE request. No interworking is performed in these scenarios as 3GPP TS
24.082 [24] does not allow this information to be presented to the subscriber
in a manner consistent with 3GPP TS 24.604 [23].
##### 5.6.6.3.3 Notification to a terminating user on CS access
When interworking a SIP INVITE request to a SETUP message as described in
clause 5.4.3, the MSC Server shall apply the following interworking to provide
notification of CDIV if a History-Info header field is present in the INVITE
request:
\- if any history entry in the History-Info header field contains a \"cause\"
SIP URI parameter, as defined in IETF RFC 4458 [49], set to a value listed in
table 5.6.6.3.2.1, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY information element
containing a NotifySS operation indicating the call has been forwarded. The
NotifySS operation shall contain an SS-Code as specified in 3GPP TS 24.082
[24] and 3GPP TS 24.072 [25] mapped from the value of the last \"cause\" SIP
URI parameter according to table 5.6.6.3.2.1.
\- if
a) the SIP INVITE request does not contain a Privacy header field with any of
the privacy values \"header\", \"session\" or \"history\"; and
b) the history entry in the History-Info header field preceding the last
history entry in History-Info header field containing a \"cause\" SIP URI
parameter defined in IETF RFC 4458 [49] set to a value listed in table
5.6.6.3.2.1 does not contain an escaped privacy header field with a value of
\"history\",
\- then the following additional interworking shall be applied:
\- if the hi-targeted-to-uri within the history entry preceding the last
history entry containing a \"cause\" SIP URI parameter contains a tel URI or a
SIP URI with \"user=phone\", the MSC Server shall include a redirecting party
BCD number information element set as follows:
\- if the tel URI or telephone number within the SIP URI is in international
format, set the type of number to \"international number\", otherwise set the
type of number to \"national number\";
\- set the number plan identification to \"ISDN/telephony numbering plan\";
\- set the presentation indicator to \"presentation allowed\";
\- set the screening indicator to \"network provided\"; and
\- set the number digits fields to the telephone number contained in the tel
URI or SIP URI;
NOTE: The number mapping does not include any digits contained in the phone-
context parameter.
\- otherwise,
\- the MSC Server shall build a redirecting party BCD number information
element as follows:
\- set the type of number to \"unknown\";
\- set the number plan identification to \"unknown\";
\- set the presentation indicator to \"number not available due to
interworking\"; and
\- set the screening indicator to \"network provided\".
### 5.6.7 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)
#### 5.6.7.1 General
The following clauses describe the MSC Server interworking behaviour related
to the ECT service defined in 3GPP TS 24.629 [33] and a UE using CS access
domain signalling specified in 3GPP TS 24.091 [32].
#### 5.6.7.2 MSC Server as transferor on behalf of UE
When the MSC Server receives a FACILITY message containing an ECT request from
a UE with one answered call in a held state and another call in an answered
and active or alerting state as specified in 3GPP TS 24.091 [32], the MSC
Server shall build and send a REFER request as specified for a transferor UE
in 3GPP TS 24.629 [33].
When the MSC Server receives a NOTIFY request on the REFER dialog,
interworking shall be applied based upon the SIP response status-code
contained in the \"message/sipfrag\" message body as follows:
\- if status-code 100 Trying is received, no interworking is applied;
\- if status-code 200 OK is received, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY
message indicating transfer success to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.091
[32]. The MSC Server shall then initiate clearing of the two calls towards the
UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.091 [32] and initiate clearing of the IM CN
subsystem session with the transferee as specified in clause 5.5.4.
\- if status-code 503 is received, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY
message with a return error parameter set to \"SystemFailure\" and leave the
two calls from the UE in the conditions they were in prior to the ECT request;
\- if any other status-code is received, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY
message with a return error parameter set to \"IllegalSS-Operation\" and leave
the two calls from the UE in the conditions they were in prior to the ECT
request.
#### 5.6.7.3 MSC Server as transferee on behalf of UE
##### 5.6.7.3.1 Actions without 3PCC
NOTE 1: CS domain access signalling as specified in 3GPP TS 24.091 [32] does
not provide a mechanism to present the transfer request to the transferee for
authorization of the transfer. Automatic acceptance and execution of the REFER
request by the MSC Server can therefore pose a security risk or have unwanted
charging consequences. Acceptance of REFER requests is therefore subject to
operator policy, which is outside the scope of the present document.
When the MSC Server receives a REFER request in the context of a call transfer
scenario as described in 3GPP TS 24.629 [33] clause 4.5.2.4.1.2.2, the MSC
Server may perform the actions specified for a transferee UE in 3GPP TS 24.629
[33].
If the MSC Server does not support accepting REFER requests on behalf of the
UE per operator policy, then the MSC Server shall return a 403 Forbidden
response.
If the MSC Server received a non-zero SS screening indicator from the UE as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.080 [29], then upon sending the NOTIFY request
indicating that the transfer is complete, the MSC Server may send a FACILITY
message to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.091 [32]. The MSC Server may
include an Rdn parameter set to indicate that the remote party number is not
available due to interworking.
NOTE 2: The remote party number, as indicated in the Refer-To header sent by
the transferor, is not available to the MSC Server as it is replaced by the
transferor AS as specified in 3GPP TS 24.629 [33].
NOTE 3: Depending on the conferencing implementation in the IM CN subsystem
(e.g. the manner in which users are invited to a conference), the MSC Server
might not be able to distinguish between REFER requests for the ECT service
and REFER requests for the conferencing service. In such cases, the MSC Server
will not know which SS operation to indicate in the FACILITY message. Handling
of this scenario is implementation specific.
##### 5.6.7.3.2 Actions with 3PCC
When 3PCC is used for ECT as specified in 3GPP TS 24.629 [33], no special
interworking is required at the MSC Server.
#### 5.6.7.4 MSC Server as transfer target on behalf of UE
When the MSC Server receives an INVITE request which does not replace an
existing session (e.g. blind ECT), the MSC Server shall follow the
interworking procedures specified in clause 5.4.
When the MSC Server receives an INVITE request which replaces an existing
session, the MSC Server shall perform the actions specified for a transfer
target UE in 3GPP TS 24.629 [33]. If the MSC Server received a non-zero SS
screening indicator as defined in 3GPP TS 24.080 [29], then upon successful
session establishment with the transferee the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY
message to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.091 [32] with the following
interworking applied:
\- if a Privacy header with priv-value set to \"id\" is present, the MSC
Server may include an Rdn parameter in the FACILITY message set to indicate
presentation restricted as specified in 3GPP TS 24.080 [29];
\- if a Privacy header with a priv-value set to \"id\" is not present in the
INVITE request, then:
\- if a P-Asserted-Identity header containing a tel URI or a SIP URI with
\"user=phone\" is present in the INVITE, the MSC Server may include an Rdn
parameter in the FACILITY message with a value set to the telephone number
contained in this URI;
\- if a P-Asserted-Identity header is present but does not contain a tel URI
or a SIP URI with \"user=phone\", the MSC Server may include an Rdn parameter
in the FACILITY message set to indicate the number is not available due to
interworking as specified in 3GPP TS 24.080 [29].
### 5.6.8 Conference (CONF)
#### 5.6.8.1 General
IM CN subsystem CONF functionality at a MSC Server is specified in 3GPP TS
24.292 [7]. The following clauses describe the MSC Server interworking
behaviour related to the CONF service defined in 3GPP TS 24.605 [35] and a UE
using CS access domain signalling specified in 3GPP TS 24.084 [34].
#### 5.6.8.2 MSC Server as conference creator
##### 5.6.8.2.1 Conference creation
When the MSC Server receives a BuildMPTY request from a UE with one active
call and one held call as described in 3GPP TS 24.084 [34], the MSC Server
shall initiate conference creation and invite the remote parties to the
conference as described in 3GPP TS 24.292 [7].
NOTE: Conference creation and inviting users to the conference are two
distinct actions in the IM CN subsystem. However, in CS access signalling a
single message creates the conference and adds the existing calls to the
conference.
After receiving NOTIFY requests indicating both remote parties have
successfully transferred to the conference, the MSC Server shall send a
FACILITY message indicating BuildMPTY success as specified in 3GPP TS 24.084
[34].
If a non-200 final response to the INVITE request which attempts to create the
conference is received, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY message with a
return error parameter set to \"SystemFailure\" and leave the two calls from
the UE in the conditions they were in prior to the conference creation
request.
##### 5.6.8.2.2 Putting the conference on hold
When the MSC Server receives a HoldMPTY request from a UE with an active
conference, the MSC Server shall send an UPDATE or re-INVITE request
containing a new SDP offer as described in clause 5.6.3.1.1.
Upon receipt of the SDP answer in a 200 OK response to the UPDATE or re-INVITE
request, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY message indicating success as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.084 [34].
If the SDP offer is rejected or a non-200 response is received to the UPDATE
or re-INVITE request, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY message as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.084 [34] with a return error parameter set to
\"SystemFailure\".
##### 5.6.8.2.3 Resuming a held conference
When the MSC Server receives a RetrieveMPTY request from a UE with a
conference on hold, the MSC Server shall send an UPDATE or re-INVITE request
containing a new SDP offer as described in clause 5.6.3.1.2.
Upon receipt of the SDP answer in a 200 OK response to the UPDATE or re-INVITE
request, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY message indicating success as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.084 [34].
If the SDP offer is rejected or a non-200 response is received to the UPDATE
or re-INVITE request, the MSC Server shall send a FACILITY message with a
return error parameter set to \"SystemFailure\".
##### 5.6.8.2.4 Adding a party to the conference
When the MSC Server receives a BuildMPTY from a UE with a conference on hold
and separate active or waiting call as described in 3GPP TS 24.084 [34], the
MSC Server shall:
\- invite the remote party to the conference as described in 3GPP TS 24.292
[7]; and
\- send an UPDATE or re-INVITE request to resume the held conference as
described in clause 5.6.3.1.2.
##### 5.6.8.2.5 Terminating the conference or disconnecting a party from the
conference
When the MSC Server receives a DISCONNECT message from a UE with an
established conference, with a transaction identifier corresponding to a
specific remote party, the MSC Server shall start a conference termination
specific timer. While the timer is running, MSC Server shall collect potential
further DISCONNECT messages from the UE, with valid transaction identifiers,
corresponding to other remote parties. These additional DISCONNECT messages
shall not trigger starting a new timer and shall not restart the timer.
NOTE 1: The value for the conference termination timer is implementation
specific. The timer has to be long enough to allow that the UE encodes and
transmits all the DISCONNECT messages to the MSC Server but it should be kept
short so that the DISCONNECT messages used for disconnecting a single
conference participant are not delayed too long. A value around 1 sec is seen
as satisfactory.
When the timer expires, MSC Server shall examine, whether it has received a
DISCONNECT message corresponding to all remote parties that have been
participants of the established conference and depending on that shall act as
follows:
\- If a DISCONNECT messages has been received for each participant, the MSC
Server shall send a BYE request to the conference-URI.
NOTE 2: A complete set of DISCONNECT messages is interpreted as request to
terminate the established conference. The BYE request will lead to a
termination of the conference by the conference focus, after removal all the
participants, as described in 3GPP TS 24.147 [36], clause 5.3.2.7.
\- Otherwise, the MSC Server shall generate a separate REFER request for each
DISCONNECT message to remove the corresponding party/parties from the
conference as specified in 3GPP TS 24.147 [36] clause 5.3.1.6.3, with the
Refer-To header of the REFER request set to the address of the conference
participant being removed and also containing a \"method\" URI parameter set
to \"BYE\".
NOTE 3: The MSC Server thus treats the DISCONNECT message(s) received before
timer expiry as the user\'s request for disconnecting the party/parties
belonging to the received transaction identity/identities.
##### 5.6.8.2.6 Receipt of a SplitMPTY message
When the MSC Server receives a SplitMPTY request from the UE, the MSC Server
shall send a FACILITY message with a return error parameter set to \"ss-
NotAvailable\".
#### 5.6.8.3 MSC Server as conference participant
##### 5.6.8.3.1 Receipt of invitation to conference
###### 5.6.8.3.1.1 General
The methods by which the MSC Server, on behalf of the UE, can be invited to a
conference are described in 3GPP TS 24.605 [35] clause 4.5.2.1.2 and 3GPP TS
24.147 [36] clause 5.3.1.5.
###### 5.6.8.3.1.2 Receipt of REFER within a dialog
Upon receipt of a REFER request within a dialog, the MSC Server shall act as a
transferee on behalf of the UE as specified in clause 5.6.7.3.1.
NOTE 1: If the Refer-To header of the REFER request contains a conference URI,
this will result in the user joining a conference.
NOTE 2: CS domain access signalling as specified in 3GPP TS 24.091 [32] does
not provide a mechanism to present the transfer request to the transferee for
authorization of the transfer. Automatic acceptance and execution of the REFER
request by the MSC Server can therefore pose a security risk or have unwanted
charging consequences. Acceptance of REFER requests is therefore subject to
operator policy, which is outside the scope of the present document.
###### 5.6.8.3.1.3 Receipt of REFER outside a dialog
If the MSC Server does not support accepting REFER requests on behalf of the
UE per operator policy, then the MSC Server shall return a 403 Forbidden
response.
Support for the MSC Server, on behalf of a UE, joining a conference in this
manner requires that the MSC Server shall:
\- initiate a terminating call leg toward the UE in accordance with 3GPP TS
24.008 [3]; and
NOTE: If the user is involved in a call, then the call waiting procedures
described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] and 3GPP TS 24.083 [26] apply.
\- initiate an originating call toward the URI identified in the Refer-To
header (e.g. the conference URI); and
\- combine these two call legs into a single call.
Support for this method of joining a conference may be provided as an
implementation option but is outside the scope of the present document.
###### 5.6.8.3.1.4 Receipt of INVITE
NOTE: Clause 5.4.2 contains general applicable procedures executed upon
receipt of an initial INVITE request.
If an INVITE request is received, the MSC Server shall act as follows:
\- if the user is idle, the MSC Server shall act according to the mobile
terminating call set up procedures specified in clause 5.4;
\- if the user is engaged in an established SIP dialog and the INVITE request
contains a Replaces header field corresponding to the established dialog, the
MSC Server act as a transfer target on behalf of the UE as specified in clause
5.6.7.4; or
\- if the user is engaged in an established SIP dialog and the INVITE request
does not contain a Replaces header field corresponding to the established
dialog, the MSC Server shall follow the communication waiting procedures
described in clause 5.6.4.1.
##### 5.6.8.3.2 Notification of conference invocation
If the MSC Server received a non-zero SS screening indicator from the UE as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.080 [29], then upon joining a conference on behalf of a
UE, the MSC Server may send a FACILITY message to the UE indicating a
multiparty call has been invoked as specified in 3GPP TS 24.084 [34].
NOTE: If the MSC Server was invited to the conference via reception of a REFER
request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.147 [36] clause 5.3.1.5.2, the MSC Server
is not able to distinguish between REFER requests for the conferencing service
and REFER requests for the ECT service. In such cases, the MSC Server will not
know which SS operation to indicate in the FACILITY message. Handling of this
scenario is implementation specific.
## 5.7 Supplementary Service Configuration
### 5.7.1 General
The MSC Server may support the interworking between call independent
supplementary service signalling described in 3GPP TS 24.010 [41] and the XCAP
application usage for manipulating supplementary services data described in
3GPP TS 24.623 [42]. This MSC Server may support this interworking for any
subset of the supplementary services within the scope of the present document.
This interworking shall only be performed for the TS11 service code. If the
MSC Server interworks a supplementary service invoke operation received via
NAS signalling to the IM CN subsystem, the MSC Server shall not also transfer
the received information to the VLR as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [20]. This
interworking is defined in the following subclauses.
NOTE: This interworking is subject to the limitations inherited by the NAS
signalling procedures defined for each supplementary service. For example, if
no NAS signalling procedure is defined for registration, erasure, activation,
deactivation or interrogation of a particular supplementary service that is
being controlled by the IM CN subsystem, then no interworking procedure is
defined.
### 5.7.2 Receipt of REGISTER message
Upon receipt of a REGISTER message for a supplementary service whose
interworking is within the scope of the present document, the MSC Server shall
generate the appropriate HTTP request according to table 5.7.2.1 if
supplementary service configuration interworking for that supplementary
service is supported by the MSC Server.
Table 5.7.2.1: Mapping REGISTER / FACILITY to HTTP request
* * *
Invoke operation in the REGISTER message HTTP request RegisterSS PUT
ActivateSS PUT DeactivateSS PUT InterrogateSS GET EraseSS PUT
* * *
NOTE: Not all invoke operations are valid for all supplementary services.
Interworking definitions for each supplementary service are only provided for
invoke operations explicitly defined for each supplementary service.
The interworking of message contents for each supplementary service is
described in clause 5.7.4.
### 5.7.3 Receipt of HTTP response
Upon receipt of an HTTP response to a previously sent HTTP request as
described in clause 5.7.2, the MSC Server shall terminate the appropriate
service interaction by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message. The interworking of
message contents for each supplementary service is described in clause 5.7.4.
### 5.7.4 Service data interworking
#### 5.7.4.1 Originating identification presentation/restriction (OIP/OIR)
##### 5.7.4.1.1 Registration/erasure
The OIP/OIR services require no registration. Erasure is not applicable.
##### 5.7.4.1.2 Activation/deactivation
The OIP/OIR services are activated at provisioning and deactivated at
withdrawal and therefore require no interworking at the MSC Server.
##### 5.7.4.1.3 Interrogation
If the MSC Sever supports supplementary service configuration interworking for
the OIP/OIR services, the interworking procedures in this clause shall be
applied.
When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with an InterrogateSS invoke
operation for the CLIP or CLIR supplementary service code as described in 3GPP
TS 24.081 [12], the MSC Server shall generate and send an HTTP GET request to
fetch the instance of the Originating Identity document as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.623 [42].
Upon receiving a response to the HTTP GET request, the MSC Server shall apply
the following interworking:
\- If a 200 OK response is received which includes an Originating Identity
document as defined in 3GPP TS 24.607 [43], the MSC Server shall send a
RELEASE COMPLETE message as follows:
\- If the Originating Identity document indicates the interrogated service
(CLIP/OIP or CLIR/OIR) is active, the MSC Server shall indicate an SS-Status
of provisioned and active; or
\- If the Originating Identity document indicates the interrogated service
(CLIP/OIP or CLIR/OIR) service is not active, the MSC Server shall indicate an
SS-Status of provisioned but not active;
\- If the CLIR/OIR service was interrogated, then the following additional
interworking shall be applied:
\- If there is a \"default-behaviour\" attribute included and set to
\"presentation-restricted\" in the Originating Identity document, the MSC
Server shall set the CLI Restriction Option parameter to indicate Temporary
(Default Restricted);
\- If there is a \"default-behaviour\" attribute included and set to
\"presentation-not-restricted\" in the Originating Identity document the MSC
Server shall set the CLI Restriction Option parameter to Temporary (Default
Allowed);
\- If a non 200 OK response is received or if a 200 OK response is received
which does not include an Originating Identity document, the MSC Server shall
send a RELEASE COMPLETE message with an implementation-specific error code.
#### 5.7.4.2 Terminating identification presentation/restriction (TIP/TIR)
##### 5.7.4.2.1 Registration/erasure
The TIP/TIR services require no registration. Erasure is not applicable.
##### 5.7.4.2.2 Activation/deactivation
The TIP/TIR services are activated at provisioning and deactivated at
withdrawal and therefore require no interworking at the MSC Server.
##### 5.7.4.2.3 Interrogation
If the MSC Sever supports supplementary service configuration interworking for
the TIP/TIR services, the interworking procedures in this clause shall be
applied.
When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with an InterrogateSS invoke
operation for the COLP or COLR supplementary service code as described in 3GPP
TS 24.081 [12], the MSC Server shall generate an HTTP GET request to fetch the
instance of the Terminating Identity document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.623
[42].
Upon receiving a response to the HTTP GET request, the MSC Server shall apply
the following interworking:
\- If a 200 OK response is received which includes a Terminating Identity
document as defined in 3GPP TS 24.608 [14], the MSC Server shall send a
RELEASE COMPLETE message as follows:
\- If the Terminating Identity document indicates the interrogated service
(COLP/TIP or COLR/TIR) is active, the MSC Server shall indicate an SS-Status
of provisioned and active; or
\- If the Terminating Identity document indicates the interrogated service
(COLP/TIP or COLR/TIR) service is not active, the MSC Server shall indicate an
SS-Status of provisioned but not active;
NOTE: CS signalling defined in 3GPP TS 24.081 [12] does not allow for the
temporary mode status of the COLR service to be sent to the UE.
\- If a non 200 OK response is received or if a 200 OK response is received
which does not include a Terminating Identity document, the MSC Server shall
send a RELEASE COMPLETE message with an implementation-specific error code.
#### 5.7.4.3 Communication Hold (HOLD)
Configuration of the HOLD service involves no signalling and therefore
requires no interworking at the MSC Server.
#### 5.7.4.4 Communication Waiting (CW)
##### 5.7.4.4.1 Registration/erasure
The CW service requires no registration. Erasure is not applicable.
##### 5.7.4.4.2 Activation/deactivation
If the MSC Sever supports supplementary service configuration interworking for
the CW service, the interworking procedures in this clause shall be applied.
When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with an ActivateSS or
DeactivateSS invoke operation for the CW supplementary service code as
described in 3GPP TS 24.083 [26], the MSC Server shall include an instance of
the call waiting document described in 3GPP TS 24.615 [44] in the HTTP PUT
request as follows:
\- If the invoke operation is ActivateSS, the MSC Server shall set the
\"active\" attribute to \"true\";
\- If the invoke operation is DeactivateSS, the MSC Server shall set the
\"active\" attribute to \"false\".
##### 5.7.4.4.3 Interrogation
If the MSC Sever supports supplementary service configuration interworking for
the CW service, the interworking procedures in this clause shall be applied.
When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with an InterrogateSS invoke
operation for the CW supplementary service code as described in 3GPP TS 24.083
[26], the MSC Server shall generate and send an HTTP GET request to fetch the
instance of the call waiting document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 [42].
When a response to the HTTP GET request is received, the MSC Server shall
apply the following interworking:
\- If a 200 OK is received which includes a call waiting document as defined
in 3GPP TS 24.615 [44], the MSC Server shall send a RELEASE COMPLETE message
as follows:
\- If the call waiting document includes an \"active\" attribute set to
\"true\", the MSC Server shall indicate an SS-Status of provisioned and
active;
\- If the call waiting document includes an \"active\" attribute set to
\"false\", the MSC Server shall indicate an SS-Status of provisioned but not
active;
\- If a non 200 OK response is received or if a 200 OK response is received
which does not include a call waiting document, the MSC Server shall send a
RELEASE COMPLETE message with an implementation-specific error code.
#### 5.7.4.5 Communication Barring (CB)
##### 5.7.4.5.1 Registration/erasure
When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with a RegisterSS invoke
operation for any call barring supplementary service code as described in 3GPP
TS 24.088 [30], the MSC Server shall send a RELEASE COMPLETE message with an
implementation-specific error code.
NOTE: This is because the password registration procedures required to support
CB registration using NAS signalling do not have equivalencies in 3GPP TS
24.623 [42] or 3GPP TS 24.611 [31].
Erasure of the CB service is not specified for NAS signalling in 3GPP TS
24.088 [30], therefore interworking procedures for service erasure are not
applicable.
##### 5.7.4.5.2 Activation/deactivation
When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with an ActivateSS or
DeactivateSS invoke operation for any call barring supplementary service code
as described in 3GPP TS 24.088 [30], the MSC Server shall send a RELEASE
COMPLETE message with an implementation-specific error code.
NOTE: This is because the password registration procedures required to support
CB activation and deactivation using NAS signalling do not have equivalencies
in 3GPP TS 24.623 [42] or 3GPP TS 24.611 [31].
##### 5.7.4.5.3 Interrogation
If the MSC Server supports supplementary service configuration interworking
for the CB service, the interworking procedures in this clause shall be
applied.
When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with an InterrogateSS invoke
operation for the BAOC or BAIC supplementary service code as described in 3GPP
TS 24.082 [24], the MSC Server shall generate and send an HTTP GET request to
fetch the instance of the Communication Barring document as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.623 [42].
When a response to the HTTP GET request is received, the MSC Server shall
apply the following interworking:
\- If a 200 OK response is received which includes a Communication Barring
document as defined in 3GPP TS 24.611 [31], the MSC Server shall send a
RELEASE COMPLETE message as follows:
\- If the Communication Barring document indicates the call barring service
being interrogated is active, the MSC Server shall include a BasicServiceCode
set to the TS11 service code;
\- If the Communication Barring document indicates the call barring service
being interrogated is not active, the MSC Server shall include an SS-Status of
deactivated;
\- If a non 200 OK response is received or if a 200 OK response is received
which does not include a Communication Barring document, the MSC Server shall
send a RELEASE COMPLETE message with an implementation-specific error code.
When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with an InterrogateSS invoke
operation for the BOIC, BOIC-exHC or BIC-Roam supplementary service code as
described in 3GPP TS 24.082 [24], the MSC Server shall send a RELEASE COMPLETE
message with an implementation-specific error code as these supplementary
service codes cannot be mapped to the CB rules defined in 3GPP TS 24.611 [31].
#### 5.7.4.6 Communication Diversion (CDIV)
##### 5.7.4.6.1 Registration
If the MSC Server supports supplementary service configuration interworking
for the CDIV service, the interworking procedures in this clause shall be
applied.
When the MSC Server receives a REGISTER message with a RegisterSS invoke
operation for a supplementary service code listed below, the MSC Server shall
