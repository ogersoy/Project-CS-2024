Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been

# 1 Scope
The present document describes the protocols to be used when ITU-T Q.1902
\"Bearer Independent Call Control\" is used as call control protocol in a 3GPP
Bearer Independent CS core network 3GPP TS 23.205 [1] The Q.1902 operates
between (G)MSC servers .The BICC architecture as described in ITU-T Q.1902
[6]-[10] consists of a number of protocols. The following types of protocols
are described: call control protocol, bearer control protocols and a resource
control protocol for this architecture. The architecture complies with the
requirements imposed by 3GPP TS 23.205 [1] and TS 23.153 [2].
The present document is valid for a 3^rd^ generation PLMN (UMTS) complying
with Release 4 and later.
Note: Q.1902 can be used in other network architectures than the one defined
in 3GPP TS 23.205 [1]
