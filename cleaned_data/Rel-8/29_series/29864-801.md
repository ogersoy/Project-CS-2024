# Introduction
An Application Server service data representation is identified specific to an
IMS telephony application server.
# 1 Scope

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
Within GSM MAP, operations and parameters were defined. Parameters rely
heavily on sub parameters.
In this service data description mapping, the operations correlate to diameter
Sh Read/Write/Subscribe/Notify, and therefore will not be specified.
Table 3.1-1: Definitions
* * *
Term Definition Database An independent table that is written to the HSS. This
is a collection of data accessed through a common mechanism. It is stored and
administered as one entity. Each database has a unique ServiceIndication. Each
may be included within a Diameter Sh request, but recent Sh commands allow
multiple queries within the same Request. Diameter Sh error scenarios do allow
successful read operations with failures simply omitted, so care must be taken
when separating data into distinct databases. Release The versioning of a
database that defines new content definition. Each Release has a release ID
and is accompanied by a length parameter so that multiple releases can be
parsed even by an AS not familiar with the contents of a specific release.
Data contained within a Release can be categorized into various structured
types, bitmap, string, and varbyte are some examples.
* * *
Releases begin with a release identifier and release length. The length points
to the end of data definition for the release. This is either the end of the
defined database or the beginning of a subsequent release.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905

# 4 Requirements for defining Application Server Specific Service Data
## 4.1 Introduction
This clause contains a list of the requirements for the solution provided in
this study. The primary aim is to define an Application Server service
specific schema that facilitates ease of Application Server interoperability
in a multi-vendor network. Additional benefits to management plane and service
configuration can also be envisioned from an operator perspective.
## 4.2 Requirements for AS Interoperability
Currently, IMS standards define the role of Sh and very generically specify
things like transport and protocol. This means things like command sets,
schemas, and services are all undefined and proprietary to each vendor. The
conclusion is that vendors may end up building proprietary solutions that
cannot inter-work. Every other combination represents a separate development
as desired by the operator and leads to operator supervising expensive and
time consuming inter-operability events.
In summary, responsibility lies with both parties---operators and vendors
---to encourage the adoption of standards and the preservation of
interoperability. If this issue is handled correctly, both benefit: operators
become more productive and drive down costs and vendors are able to compete on
the quality of their product.
## 4.3 Flow of Information between HSS and AS
It is vital to have a clear definition of the services and the nature of
service information exchanged between HSS and AS. This implies that specifying
the service data schema will also provide guidance on information exchanged
over the Sh interface.
## 4.4 Role of Sh interface for IMS and non-IMS services
Sh is defined as a reference Point between an AS (SIPâ€‘AS or OSAâ€‘SCS) and an
HSS. Sh interface allows access to non-transparent data which represents the
state, location of subscribers in CS, PS and IMS domains and has a defined
schema providing IMS applications access to HLR/HSS service data.
Additionally, it allows access to transparent data which can represent
anything. 3GPP does not impose a schema on this data, it is treated at the HSS
as data blob and mechanisms are defined to allow access and sharing by
multiple application servers. There should be methods to define a standardised
AS service data schema for services that are transported within the data blob,
which will help in satisfying the architectural requirements.
## 4.5 Reuse and Extensibility
In solutions provided compatibility with existing service data definitions
must be considered. Additional Application Server service extensions, if
defined should allow co-existence with current service data schemes. Section 8
discusses data extension and backward compatibility issues in further detail.
## 4.6 User Re-homing and Load Balancing
To facilitate re-homing of users to application servers and load balancing,
the definition of IMS application server service data descriptions increases
the opportunity for hosting services on alternative application servers.
# 5 Mechanisms for Transfer of Defined Service Data between Application Server
and the HSS
## 5.1 Introduction
There are several forms in which the service data could be transferred between
the AS and HSS over Sh interface. The data sent may be in a compressed form or
not depending on the nature of compressions algorithm supported by HSS and AS.
Definition refers to a set of attributes supporting application functionality
and how they are to be commonly interpreted or encoded by a compliant AS.
Compression, defines the mechanism of reducing the definition to transmit and
store smaller versions of the data definition.
## 5.2 Defined features
The data to support Telephony application server features are identified in
the following list taken from 3GPP TS 22.173 [3]. The feature list may be
expanded in the future, but initially will contain the following capabilities:
  * Originating Identification Presentation (OIP)
  * Originating Identification Restriction (OIR)
  * Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP)
  * Terminating Identification Restriction (TIR)
  * Malicious Communication IDentification (MCID)
  * Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR)
  * Communication DIVersion (CDIV)
  * Communication Waiting (CW)
  * Communication HOLD (HOLD)
  * Communication Barring (CB)
  * Completion of Communications to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
  * Completion of Communications No Reply (CCNR)
> NOTE: CCNR is not listed in 3GGP TS 22.173 [3]
  * Message Waiting Indication (MWI)
  * CONFerence (CONF)
  * Three-Party (3PTY)
  * Advice Of Charge (AOC)
  * Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)
  * Reverse charging
  * Closed User Group (CUG)
  * Flexible Alerting (FA)
  * Customized Alerting Tone (CAT)
> NOTE: CAT is not listed in 3GGP TS 22.173 [3]
Conveying this data from an application server to the HSS requires definition
of the details for each of the features and is implemented within the
application server.
## 5.3 Data sent over Sh in an uncompressed format
{width="3.4784722222222224in" height="2.145138888888889in"}
Figure 5.3-1: AS service data exchanged in uncompressed format
Tradeoffs between transmission rate and compression/decompression processing
time should be considered. It is possible to operate an interface at a higher
data rate by transmitting uncompressed data. This would be the case if
transmitting compressed data required significant overhead time due to the
invocation of the compression/decompression component. Transmitting
uncompressed data may allow for faster session processing (system does not
need to employ conversion algorithms before operating on the data) where the
size of data being transferred over the interface is not critical. This
compression/decompression activity may not be required if the AS stores this
data in an uncompressed form (e.g. xml documents).
## 5.4 Data sent over Sh in compressed format
{width="4.759722222222222in" height="1.8847222222222222in"}
Figure 5.4-1: AS service data exchanged in compressed format
This mechanism works on the basis that the storing AS and the AS recalling
data understand the encoding schemes and compression algorithm. Compression is
useful in order to save memory space and transmission bandwidth. The possible
fallout may include excessive processing which may cause problems with certain
applications. The AS could carry out this negotiation through transparent data
content to indicate upon a commonly supported compression/decompression
algorithm. An alternative method could be the use of O&M to ensure a common
compression/decompression algorithm
The disadvantage of this proposal is that they could involve heavy
standardisation work to co-ordinate compression/decompression algorithms
across all Application Servers.
## 5.5 Location of compression options
There are two alternatives for the location of compression/decompression
algorithms.
  * Option A: compression/decompression algorithms at AS
This allows easy extension of XML increasing overall network efficiency.
However to satisfy, AS interoperability requirement this would require heavy
standardisation efforts to include different compression/decompression
algorithms. This option is applicable to Figure 5.4-1.
  * Option B: compression/decompression algorithms at HSS.
{width="3.8430555555555554in" height="2.5930555555555554in"}
Figure 5.5-1: HSS storage of AS service data
This option is independent of the nature of data exchanged over the Sh
interface. In this option the compression/decompression algorithm could
operate on data received at the HSS over the Sh. The HSS could have knowledge
of the data being received and could choose a compression algorithm based upon
the type of data, or instance of data being transmitted. This is not
advisable, as the App Server and HSS would need to be coordinated requiring a
standardization/definition exercise for each application server or application
server data increment. This is contrary to our rapid AS development goal in
IMS.
In conclusion, the compression/decompression algorithms stored by HSS do not
influence the nature of data sent over the Sh interface. Different
compression/decompression and formats of storage mechanisms are HSS
implementation specific and out of scope of this WID.
## 5.6 Information Content vs. representation
To facilitate centralized storage, the information required to create basic
telephony services must be conveyed to the HSS. To facilitate session
processing, it must be conveyed to the requesting application server. This
information is stored co resident with session processing in the active
application server. This co-resident version is considered a cache. The master
copy is viewed as the version stored in the HSS.
One application server goal is to allow higher subscriber numbers/capacity per
application server. This goal requires architecture of this data to be
extremely compact, regardless of the size of data transmitted from/to the
centralized storage facility in the HSS, this form can be retained after
registration. Increased numbers of subscribers that are concurrently cached at
an application server drives capacity.
The HSS is impacted with increased size of this transferred data. Available
memory in an HSS is allocated to each subscriber. Higher memory use per
subscriber inversely affects the HSS capacity. For this reason, the HSS will
consider compression of the stored data if that is practical.
With transparent data, the HSS is not aware of the content of the data. If the
HSS were aware of content, then it could use this knowledge to reduce the size
of the stored image. Since it is not, only generic compression techniques are
available for this use.
If extensibility mechanisms such as XML are used to store data in an HSS, the
expected increase in transmitted then stored information between the HSS and
the application server could be between 15 and 50 or even more. An example
showing the XML expansion effect when it is used to represent communication
forwarding busy follows. The XML shown is a representation of data related to
communication forwarding busy.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="1.26875in"}
Figure 5.6-1: Expansion ratio example
This expansion ratio value may significantly vary from one example to another
and according to the data encoding choice, but it does not change the overall
conclusion on the XML expansion effect. However, if trying to add flexibility
to the binary encoding (see e.g. the example in 3GPP TS 24.604 [4] clause
4.9.1.2) additional information such as length and type indicators is required
which will also affect the ratio. These considerations (size and bandwidth vs.
flexibility) need to be weighted in order to select the format.
The XML advantages that make it largely used, i.e. ease of readability, a
generic standard, do have cost aspects that XML induces regarding memory size
and bandwidth which drive to consider a more compact form of IMS service data
description.
Compression is discussed in sub-chapter 5.7. Flexibility aspects are covered
in section 7 dealing with extensions.
## 5.7 Evaluation of compression options
### 5.7.1 Introduction
In case size is considered a problem, options for compression algorithms that
would operate on the service data and their possible location options are
described.
### 5.7.2 Architecture aspects
Figure 5.7.2-1 indicates three alternative locations for compression
execution.
One option for compression is within the HSS complex, closest to the data
storage. This would allow varying compression algorithms to be used in the
network, and would leave the Transparent Data compression task and algorithm
to be specified at each database. This is shown as option 3.
Another option (option 2) would be to identify a compression algorithm that
would operate on Data received at the HSS. The HSS could have knowledge of the
data being received (XML, encoded binary, .wav, text) and could choose a
compression algorithm based upon the type of data, or instance of data being
transmitted. This could even be determined and pre-configured per
ServiceIndication. This begins to share specific contents of the HSS
transparent Data in order to drive network efficiencies. As the ultimate
progression of this HSS compression, the HSS may require specific knowledge of
the XML contents so that it may efficiently store the received data.
Potentially, this could require development on the HSS, or additions to HSS
capabilities to allow a service to load and store a schema so that compression
was available.
Figure 5.7.2-1: Compression Algorithms
Finally (option 1) we consider a mechanism wherein the Application servers
agree upon a compression algorithm. This would allow any flexibility for XML
extension, and may allow human readable visibility to the transmitted
information, albeit prior to transmission. It appears as a data expansion to
XML, followed by an almost immediate compression.
Notice that for increased network efficiency, compression should be performed
closer to the left side of the figure. Compression schemes applied closer to
the left also require more standardization or coordination to ensure the
compression algorithm is similarly applied across all ASs.
### 5.7.3 Compression algorithm discussion
A binary encoded format, storing information using defined structures, is a
form of compression that is extremely efficient. As indicated in clause 5.6
this efficiency will vary depending on the degree of flexibility required.
XML documents are flexible in specifying elements that can be combined freely,
such as rules for the CDIV services. Normally, the XML elements have quite
long names in order to be man-readable. If the size is considered a problem,
compression may be an option. There are many examples of compression methods
for text based messages. The simplest example is the compact form of headers
as defined for SIP. Slightly more advanced is to build a dictionary of common
strings, which has been defined for SIP and SDP in IETF RFC 3485 [25]. Using
gzip is a third widely used method.
Compression algorithms for XML may negate one of its alleged values that is
being man-readable. It will also be required to specify a common compression
algorithm for AS interoperability.
XML compressors use different degrees of knowledge of the XML structure. Some
XML compressors make use of the fact that they are operating on an XML file,
some compressors also make use of a prior knowledge of the XML schema, and
some compressors make no prior assumptions at all. Needless to say, more prior
information generally results in more efficient algorithms.
When it comes to standards, some efforts have been done to standardize XML
specific compression algorithms. ITU-T has specified the \'Fast Infoset\'
binary encoding in ITU-T Rec. X.891 [26].
W3C are in the late stages of developing a specification for Efficient XML
Interchange (EXI) [27]. The current status of that work is that a complete
working draft is out for review, and they plan to have a candidate
specification in December 2008.
It seems that there are two options for compression. Either use the emerging
W3C standard, or use the widely used gzip format. The latter is not as
efficient, but as the service data are not that large in size, it will provide
a reasonably good compression.
## 5.8 Application Server Service Data Descriptions (ASSDD) Reference point.
Binary data is not permitted within the Sh interface. When binary assumptions
are made to define service data, this must be converted. Other Sh binary
transfers have used the base64 encoding scheme. For this case, a service data
definition is established as shown in Figure 5.8-1. This is at a point prior
to base 64 encoding the binary data into an ASCII, IETF RFC 20 [12] format and
including or extracting it from the Sh-Data>RepositoryData> ServiceData XML
tags within the User-Data AVP. The defined format is not exposed on the Sh
interface. Instead it is different by the deterministically recoverable base64
encoding scheme. See IETF RFC 2045 [13], IETF RFC 3548 [14].

  * Service Authorization -- identifies if the subscriber has this service
  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
The following are from 3GPP TS 24.604 [4], Tables 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.1.2:
  * Originating user receives notification that his communication has been diverted (forwarded or deflected).
The following enumeration fields are required to support this service:
  * Served user allows the presentation of diverted to URI to originating user in diversion notification
  * Served user allows the presentation of his/her URI to divertedâ€‘to user
  * Served user allows the presentation of his/her URI to originating user in diversion notification.
Each enumeration field may contain any of:
  * No
  * Not Reveal as GRUU
  * Yes (default).
#### 6.1.2.7 Communication Diversion Notification
The following True/False information is required to support this service:
  * Served user receives reminder notification on outgoing communication that forwarding is currently activated
  * Served user receives notifications (CDIVN) of their communication diversions.
### 6.1.3 Three-Party (3PTY)/ CONFerence (CONF)
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 24.605 [5], section 4.2.1 and in 3GPP TS
22.173 [3].
3PTY communication setup is equivalent to a three party conference created on
request of the served user from existing communication sessions, this is
equivalent to three party conference creation in CONF, For this reason 3PTY
can be seen as a special case of CONF and most of service interactions for
CONF apply also to 3PTY.
The following True/False information is required to support this service:
  * Service Authorization -- identifies if the subscriber has this service
  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
NOTE: 3GPP TS 24.605 [5] does not mention subscription options such as maximum
number of conference callers.
### 6.1.4 ID Presentation Services
There are four separate ID presentation services: OIP, OIR, TIP and TIR.
#### 6.1.4.1 OIP
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 24.607 [7] and in 3GPP TS 24.173 [10].
The following True/False information is required to support this service:
  * Service Authorization -- identifies if the subscriber has this service
  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
#### 6.1.4.2 OIR
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 24.607 [7] and in 3GPP TS 24.173 [10].
The following enumerations are required to support this service:
This enumeration identifies the variant of Originating Identification
Restriction which is in place. Note that this applies to both Line and Name
Presentation. This enumeration specifies the treatment/labelling of IDs in
INVITEs and responses to INVITEs. Unsubscribed is equivalent to PERM_PUBLIC.
Table 6.1.4.2-1: OIR options
* * *
OIR Value Description RESTRICT_PERM_PRIVATE_INFO Restrict all private
information from appearing in headers RESTRICT_PERM_PRIVATE Indicate to the
network the intent to never present this calling ID (To be honoured apart from
OVERRIDE features). RESTRICT_PRIVATE_INFO The default state is to not present
(restrict) the private information from appearing in a header, but the caller
can change this per call with a dialled code. RESTRICT_PRIVATE The default
state is to not present (restrict) the ID, but the caller can change this per
call with a dialled code. RESTRICT_PUBLIC The default state is to present (not
restrict) the ID, but the caller can change this per call with a dialled code.
RESTRICT_PERM_PUBLIC Always\" present this calling ID to the network (whether
called party receives it of course depends on their subscription)
* * *
NOTE: Information options related to a user with an override capability of
this feature are for further study.
#### 6.1.4.3 TIP
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 24.608 [8] and in 3GPP TS 24.173 [10].
The following True/False information is required to support this service:
  * Service Authorization -- identifies if the subscriber has this service
  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
#### 6.1.4.4 TIR
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 24.608 [8] and in 3GPP TS 24.173 [10].
The following enumerations are required to support this service:
Table 6.1.4.2-1: TIR options
* * *
TIR Value Description RESTRICT_PERM_PRIVATE Indicate to the network the intent
to never present this terminating ID (To be honoured apart from OVERRIDE
features). RESTRICT_PRIVATE The default state is to not present (restrict) the
ID, but the called party can change this per call with a dialled code.
RESTRICT_PUBLIC The default state is to present (not restrict) the ID, but the
called party can change this per call with a dialled code.
* * *
NOTE: Information options related to a user with an override capability of
this feature are for further study
### 6.1.5 Communication Barring
This feature is defined in 3GPP 24.611 [16] and in 3GPP TS 22.173 [3].
The following True/False information is required to support this service:
  * Service Authorization -- identifies if the subscriber has this service
  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
Barring service for originations contains predetermined sets of user denied
addresses, including denial of all calls, international calls, long distance
calls, inter/intra lata calls, closed user group calls, and a variety of
nuisance number combinations. Since origination barring is predefined, and
applied the same for many subscribers, there is low likelihood of these
enumerated services being common with the Ut interface barring defined in 3GPP
24.611 [16]. Therefore the intent is to enumerate the most used barring
conditions, and allow either the enumeration or the Ut defined interface, as
appropriate.
NOTE: The repeated filtering that occurs on the Ut interface, and the document
size that would be required should this be statically stored for each user.
Both can be avoided with this enumeration.
### 6.1.6 Call blocking
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 24.611 [16] and in 3GPP TS 22.173 [3].
The following True/False information is required to support this service:

  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
### 6.1.7 Malicious Communication IDentification (MCID)
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 22.173 [3] and in 3GPP TS 24.616 [15]
The following True/False information is required to support the 2 variants of
this service:
MCID:
  * Service Authorization -- identifies if the subscriber has this service
  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
MCID_Temp:
  * Service Authorization -- identifies if the subscriber has this service
  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
### 6.1.8 Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR)
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 22.173 [3] and in 3GPP TS 24.611 [16].
The Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) service allows the served user to
reject incoming communications on which the asserted public user identity of
the originating user is restricted. In case the asserted public user identity
of the originating user is not provided then the communication shall be
allowed by the ACR service.
The following True/False information is required to support this service:
  * Service Authorization -- identifies if the subscriber has this service
  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
### 6.1.9 Communications Waiting (CW)
This feature is defined in3GPP TS 22.173 [3] and in 3GPP TS 24.615 [18].
The following True/False information is required to support this service:

This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 22.173 [3] and in 3GPP TS 24.647 [17].
The following True/False information is required to support each of the AOC-S,
AOC-D and AOC-E services:
  * Service Authorization -- identifies if the subscriber has this service
  * Service Activation -- Identifies if the subscriber has activated this service.
### 6.1.13 Reverse charging
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 22.173 [3] which heavily references ITU
I.256.3 [22].
The following enumerations are required to implement either origination or
termination party reverse charging services.
ITU I.256.3 [22] defined cases include: Each are potential capabilities for
any user.
a) [...a calling user, on a per-call basis, to request reverse charging at
call set-up time...]
b) [...calling user, during the active phase of the call, to request reverse
charging...]
c) [...called user, before disconnection of the call, to request reverse
charging for the entire call....]
d) [...called user to be charged for all incoming calls...].
### 6.1.14 Closed User Group (CUG)
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 22.173 [3] and in 3GPP TS 24.654[24].
This feature is considered low penetration. It contains data should not be
contained within a Transparent data block with other mainstream services.

### 6.1.15 Flexible Alerting (FA)
This feature is defined in 3GPP TS 24.239 [21].
This feature is considered low penetration. It contains data should not be
contained within a Transparent data block with other mainstream services.
Instead, it should be considered as a Services 3 when viewing Figure 7.2.3-1.
### 6.1.16 Completion of Communications to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)/Completion
of Communications on No Reply (CCNR)
This service is defined in 3GPP TS 24.642 [23].
The following True/False information is required to support this service:
  * Service Authorization for CCBS/CCNR -- identifies if the subscriber has this service.
# 7 Reuse and extension
## 7.1 Introduction
Extensibility allows applications to function during changes in the
surrounding architectures. Backward compatibility deals with the requirements
that must be in place prior to extending data for services. This section
addresses both.
Application servers must allow data extensions to coexist with an operational
definition of the data. Restricting the definition of services is not viable,
so it must be possible to add TAS data. Allowances for data extension and
backward compatibility are discussed further in section 7.2.
## 7.2 Extensibility of IMS Application Server Service Data Descriptions
### 7.2.1 Introduction
There are two ways of expanding AS service descriptions based on association
of service indications and the transparent data blobs. They are as follows:
Service indication per MMTel group/suite of services, and Service indications
per service within MMTel group/suite of services. Additionally, base services
get extended over time. Extending a service and expanding the number of
services can be approached differently. The following sections discuss initial
expansion (definition) of services and within each the extension of the
service is discussed.
### 7.2.2 Service indication per MMTel group/suite of service
Even established telephony services must change over time. For example, law
enforcement act, emergency services, and priority service have changed even
the basic telephony services. This extensibility section deals with the
definition of the data into blobs, and the options for extending services.
For simpler storage and retrieval, service features may be combined into a
group or groups. Larger groups should be expected as a result of initial
maturity of many service definitions. Since the data is communicated to the
HSS via transparent data, these should be grouped into Transparent Data blobs,
and identified by Service Indication name. The blob defined by a distinct
service indication is herein referred to as a database.
The service data descriptions contained in one database may be a complete
service suite definition, or can be viewed as a portion of a service
definition. The remaining portion of a service definition may be comprised of
elements specific to a particular architecture (e.g. WLAN, CDMA etc.), or a
subsequent addition to standardised service definitions, or proprietary
extensions. The principle of extensibility should be applicable to all afore-
mentioned cases.
An example figure 7.2.3-1 below considers the database contents for a distinct
service. Each of the darker services blocks (databases) represent an HSS
transparent data blob with a distinct service indication. Multiple databases
may be applied to represent a service suite on an application server.
On the left, the representation depicts the grouping of mature TAS services.
It represents that additional services be located in an extension database,
'services2'. Note that Services2 does not repeat data from the Services1 and
cannot serve a subscriber on its own, but instead extends the TAS services in
a group.
On the right, notice that many of the services defined within the Services2
structure were also extended from the Services1 structure. With this
association, if any Services1 data remains required, there will be dead data
also conveyed. Instead, we should create data so that established features are
collected in one database and outlier features, new features and low
penetration features are separated. In this way, when/if data is made
obsolete, it is more likely isolated in structures that aren\'t required by
all users. In summary, data associated with a base functionality should be
extended, rather than duplicately redefined.
Additionally, extensions to the basis of Services1 (e.g. Services4) if
generated in a distinct database, should also be extended by reference. This
could be within a structure like Services2 or within a new extension similar
to Services5.
All ASs capable of operating in a network will semantically understand the
agreed upon '3GPP Services' data. Other ASs may recognize the extensions if
appropriate.
### 7.2.3 Extensibility within defined datasets.
Databases may be expanded to keep similar features intact. This is possible
without predefining spare fields. Rules for the extensions are dependent upon
the agreed upon schemas. Backward compatibility rules must also be built into
the schemas.
{width="6.71875in" height="6.361805555555556in"}
Figure 7.2.3-1: Analysis of Extension databases: Inference and explicit
### 7.2.4 Service indications per service within MMTel group/suite of services
Another alternative (as shown in figure 7.2.4-1) is based upon assigning a
service indication for each service within the MMTel group/suite of services.
In the figure 7.2.4-1, S1, S2...Sn are service indications pointing to a
specific service.
{width="3.0930555555555554in" height="2.71875in"}
Figure 7.2.4-1: Assigning Service Indications to each service within MMTel
suite of services
The number of service indications defined shall be determined by the number of
logical service groupings. Services can be determined as unique and have their
own Service-Indication; however it is still possible for common service data
between two services. For example Call Forwarding All may have a different
Service-Indication than Call Forwarding Not Reachable though the service data
is similar. A further optimization can be achieved by using the same Service-
Indication for similar style of services names/tags for example, Call
forwarding Busy and Call Forwarding No Answer.
{width="4.093055555555556in" height="3.0930555555555554in"}
Figure 7.2.4-2: Extensions to services within MMTel suite of services
The figure 7.2.4-2 shows extensions to existing one of the services like Call
transfer (CT). This extension may happen by reference wherever there is an
existing instance of the service data i.e enhancement of an existing service.
It is understood that AS will be aware of the service indications relevant to
the services it supports. If the AS wants to read status of all services
within the MMTel suite/group, it can do so over the Sh interface using Notif-
Eff feature (See 3GPP TS 29.329 [11]).
As shown in figure, the Call Transfer CT (new) service data shall contain both
the old and the new data. While this may mean that minor obsolete aspects of
service data get carried over, the benefits of not forcing multiple queries to
the HSS to get all the data and allowing for data to be changed, not just
added are crucial systemic advantages.
The alternative described above allows greater flexibility for the operator
who may want to use different service subsets of MMTel suite/group of
services. In a distributed services environment, it is efficient for an AS to
deal with its specific service data rather than parsing though contents of the
entire MMTel blob. For example, if an AS responsible for Call forwarding
services wants to change the call forward to number on behalf of an user, it
shall not be forced to update the entire MMTel blob. Additionally an operator
who may want to extend one or two services should not be forced to define a
whole new blob just to enable a new definition for the specific services.
### 7.2.5 Recommendations
A hybrid approach of combining Service indications to form subset of services
may be possible. This optimization may be based on frequency of use,
similarity of service data etc. For example the Call forwarding Busy and Call
forwarding No Answer and Call Forwarding All services might be combined, since
the frequency of updates is often common. Further transparent data containing
Return Last Call information might have it's own Service Indication, since it
may be rewritten at a different frequency.
### 7.2.6 Syntactic and Semantic recognition.
When detected in any application server, databases that are syntactically
parsed, but not completely semantically understood by that application should
follow strict extensibility rules. These must preserve unrecognized data for
application servers that may later receive this data and understand it. This
allows newer applications to extend data versions when new data is required,
and requires the previous version of application server to permit the
additions. Syntactically all ASs must be capable of identifying unrecognized
data. Further, upon updating data in the HSS, an AS must also convey the
unrecognized data integrated with any recognized data changes.
### 7.2.7 Extensibility for information efficient data definitions.
In section 7.2.3, we note that a database (associated with a specific
ServiceIndication) can be expanded to keep related data together. This may be
necessary when adding to a feature. For example, (referring to Figure 7.2.3-1)
the \"Call Forwarding All\" addition of the ping ring feature, could be
accomplished within the database (e.g. ServiceIndication=Services1) that
initially defined CFA. If this is done, the addition/definition of
ServiceIndication=Services 2 would not be necessary.
The following is a set of rules that are necessary to facilitate extensions.
These rely on the definitions in Section 3.1 and they apply for extensions
within a ServiceIndication:
  1. Additions to a database MUST occur either in
     * Additional releases, or
     * Re-use of existing spare fields within a defined release.
  2. Each additional release MUST include an advertised release name and size
  3. All applications must retain all release information. When unknown releases exist, and when writing known releases an AS must sequentially restore unknown releases with no changes.
  4. New data can be in new release segments or new databases (Service Indication).
  5. Additions to a release MUST not allow deletion of previously defined data.
  6. Additions to a database must be 4-byte aligned.
  7. Add on feature definitions should add additional releases to the same database to keep like data in the same Service Indication.
  8. Proprietary/Significant unrelated functionality should identify new ServiceIndications.
Refer to Figure 7.2.7-1 and Figure 7.2.7-2 for distinctions on adding data in
the same database (ServiceIndication) and adding additional databases.
{width="6.15625in" height="4.613888888888889in"}
Figure 7.2.7-1: Adding to a Release
{width="6.041666666666667in" height="4.051388888888889in"}
Figure 7.2.7-2: Adding new functionality.
A new database (ServiceIndication) should be considered when significant
unrelated feature functionality is added to an application server. This is
especially true if low subscriber penetration is expected for the new data,
because this allows the additional data size to be attributed to only the
subscribers requiring the data.
An alternate design that would not define s new database is to create an
optional release within the existing database. The optional property is also
available with a new release within an existing database.
The cohesion of the data along with its eventual growth needs (maximum
possible size) may be the main criteria for selecting a new database versus
extending the existing database with an optional release.
Additions to an existing database should be considered when the additional
data is related to or used concurrently with data defined within the existing
database (ServiceIndication). This allows the data to be stored within the
same 'blob' and can ensure that related data is recalled concurrently.
Database read/write exercises will atomically succeed or fail for each
ServiceIndication, whereas multiple service indications may require retries in
some error scenarios.
A release is not only a unit of new data, but is also a unit of optioning. For
subsequent releases it should be possible to add multiple iterations of the
same release into the database. This might be used for list management and
growth. An example of this use and its efficiencies applies in the screening
list example. If the \"release\" defines one or more numbers to screen
against, but this subscriber has 3x the average number of screening entries,
then the release that defines screening members may be repeated several times
to accommodate the longer list within the same database.
### 7.2.8 Backward Compatibility for information efficient data definitions.
#### 7.2.8.1 Introduction
All future revisions must contain a mechanism for backward compatibility. The
following list contains the basic guidelines to be included. Refer to section
4.1 for terminology used in this section.
The data as presented have assumed a set of nested structures, as a means of
encapsulating related data, but this feature set has so few attributes in many
cases that we will have very sparse structures.
Since we don't go to extraordinary lengths to pack data (probably breaking
local cohesion, as related data might be spread out based on its size), we
will have bits and possibly bytes which are not used in the initial
definition. The extensibility section implies that these bits may be used
later, without going into detail about how. Given that releases (layouts) do
not have versions, the only way this works is if:
  * All bits in the fixed section of release data shipped to a TAS MUST be preserved by the TAS when rewritten. (Note: this doesn\'t require the TAS to store them; the database could be re-retrieved when an update is required, and the new data written over the old while preserving unchanged bits.)
  * On creation, all those unused bits MUST be set to a known consistent value, and extensions which start to use the bits MUST accept that initial value as indicating disabled or inactive or whatever the appropriate default for the new use is. (Alternately, interpretation of those bytes can be controlled by some other data, without which those bits and bytes are ignored. There is a similar problem with the control data, but they could conceivably be in a new release.)
The inactive value MUST be 0, for bits and full bytes both. Proprietary
extensions MUST NOT use bits (reserved or unused) in non-proprietary releases
(segments).
#### 7.2.8.2 Releases in databases
Releases in a database consist of a predefined set of data, defined at the
time of a standard baseline version. An application server must process the
first release. All subsequent release contents are optionally understood.
a. Optional releases MUST NOT become mandatory.
b. Mandatory releases MUST NOT become optional. The first release MUST be
mandatory.
c. Additional mandatory releases MUST NOT be added to an existing database.
d. Additional optional releases may be added to an existing database.
e. Existing mandatory releases MUST NOT be removed from existing databases.
f. Application servers MUST ensure that any release content that is not
understood when read is included intact if rewriting the database to the CSDB.
g. The range of any release data for an existing sub-data component MUST NOT
be reduced.
h. The meaning of any defined database content value MUST NOT be changed,
though reserved and unused contents may be defined.
i. The contents of reserved and unused entries in a database MUST be preserved
when rewriting the database.
j. The minimum length of the data portion of a database is 4 bytes.
k. Releases are required to be 4 byte aligned.
l. The size of a database shall be a multiple of 4 bytes. This may be
redundant, since releases are aligned to 4 byte boundaries. Base64 encoding
has rules for determining the fill bits if these do not align on increments of
6 bits.
m. Enumeration value ranges MAY be extended within the defined fixed space
limitations.
n. The order of subsequent release contents MAY be variable.
o. The length of each database may be variable, although subsequent definition
versions may reuse unused or reserved fields.
p. The services bitmaps DM_TAS_SERVICE_STAT svcs_asgn, svcs_actv, and
svcs_by_puid MAY identify all features for a subscription. They do not need to
be repeated in subsequent databases or in other releases of RLTAS_SERVICES.
q. Release structures may occur 0, 1 or more times. This allows variable
number of (potentially) variable length byte definitions to exist.
r. Releases are defined with a Network Byte order (Big Endian) wherein the
Most Significant byte of any multibyte data field is stored at the lowest
memory address, which is also the address of the larger field.
#### 7.2.8.3 New releases
a. New optional releases may be added to existing databases after a
recommendation has been published; however, network entities that do not
recognize these new releases MAY ignore the functionality represented.
Ignoring the functionality does not imply that the data may be ignored when
writing back to the CSDB. Information in a release MUST BE rewritten intact
when replacing data. Reference Section 7.2.8.1 item f.
b. New fields may be added to, or spare fields may be used in existing
releases; however, network entities that do not recognize these new fields may
ignore the feature functionality represented, but MUST retain these fields
when re-writing the database.
# 8 Alternative solutions
## 8.1 Introduction
This section presents the possible solutions to store subscriber data
supporting an IMS Telephony Application server and the changes required in the
specifications to implement them.
## 8.2 A Binary Storage Approach to Defining IMS Service Data
### 8.2.0 Service Data Description
The definition of TAS service data contained in this section is one realizable
mechanism of defining supplementary service data for a Telephony application
server. It contains a space efficient, therefore transmission bandwidth
efficient mechanism for defining data associated with Telephony supplementary
services in an IMS environment.
With a telephony application server, some data pertains to the handset,
whereas other data applies to each address tied to the handset.
The 3GPP data model for IMS comes in 2 variants. This exercise selected the
simpler of the 2 formats. This model is shown as (3GPP 23.228 [20] section
4.3.3.4). This is repeated in Figure 8.2.0-1.
{width="4.343055555555556in" height="1.5833333333333333in"}
Figure 8.2.0-1: 3GPP Data Model Structure
The AS may have requirements to keep data scoped to each of the boxes
identified in the above figure. This assumes that each PUID may have
independent features. The TAS structure to model is shown in Figure 8.2.0-2.
Implementations have shown that this can be achieved with databases identified
in boxes in this figure.
In the definition that follows, only the shaded portion of this figure may
apply when the PUIDs share the same services. Alternately, different services
or may apply for each PUID within a subscription, and in those instances, the
additional services, (or selection list or simultaneous_ring, etc.) databases
may apply. Subscribers with more complex features and data additions, such as
Selection features (screening, etc.) and Simultaneous Ringing (Flexible
Alerting) require separate databases. Since the Sh interface provides a query
for PUIDs within the subscription, the information defining the related PUIDs
can be obtained via Sh query, and not maintained on the TAS. The Party
database only contains data which applies across all PUIDs. Extensions to the
defined list of databases are addressed in section 7.2.
{width="6.322222222222222in" height="3.5930555555555554in"}
Figure 8.2.0-2: Association of Services across PUIDs
The information listed in this section contains detailed data fields required
to support IMS Telephony services defined with in 3GPP.
The data supporting the Services database is listed in tables complete with
use-descriptions, representing the documentation of the necessary data. This
is immediately followed within each section by the C style data definitions.
This clarifies the binary representation of this structure that will be base64
encoded into the Sh interface within the User-Data AVP.
Reserved indicates that this value is currently used for masked capabilities.
Unused indicates the data assignment may be reassigned to new functionalities.
### 8.2.1 Services Data Definition
The database name for this Service definition, as requested from an HSS
ServiceIndication is \"SERVICES RELEASE1\"
This is the main structure for services data. This is essentially per-
subscriber data, but for aliases multiple PUIDs can point to a single entry.
Data captured here is intended to reflect the data for features described in
section 6, but is currently absent of data supporting some services. These
services will be completely defined.
Table 8.2.1-1: Service Data Main Structure
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Name | Description/Details | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | svcs_hdr | **Description** | | | | | | Carries the release identifier for this | | | structure (0001) and the overall length of | | | this block (fixed + variable, including this | | | header, padded to four bytes). | | | | | | **Attribute Description** | | | | | | DM_TAS_DB_HEADER_WITH_LEN | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | svcs_asgn | **Description** | | | | | | This carries the boolean indications per | | | service whether it is assigned for this | | | subscription or not (DBYES=YES...).

Another observation is that very | | | few features are permitted to be per-PUID. | | | Provisioning must enforce that.

If different | | | features are detected, then those service | | | parameters whose svcs_by_puid bits are set | | | in the local PUID's SERVICES database apply | | | specific to that PUID. The remainder of the | | | SERVICES tuple consists of the common party | | | features. Note that potentially the Party has | | | features assigned which the PUID reserves but | | | doesn\'t have assigned. Again indexed by | | | DM_TAS_SERVICE_ID.

Table 8.2.2-1: DMTAS_FORWARD_TO
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------+ | Name | Description/Details | +----------------------+----------------------------------------------+ | DM_TAS_FORWARD_TO | **Description** | | | | | | This is the Forward-to numeric string, which | | | will be processed by Digit Analysis and | | | E.164 conversion. Might be in E.164 format | | | already, but it could also be a sequence of | | | digits, maybe even with an access code | | | (account code, authorization code, carrier | | | selection...). Not a URI - no prefix, no | | | domain; it\'s not even an implied URI, | | | unlike DMPUID_USER. This is a request URI, | | | and so may have parameters and access codes | | | which are not directly part of the | | | destination address. | | | | | | The size is somewhat arbitrary, but should | | | be large enough to handle the various codes | | | besides a directory number which might | | | appear. The size is not actually large | | | enough to hold all possible combinations. | | | | | | SEE ALSO: DMTAS_DN, when no invocation or | | | access codes are permitted (e.g. ESRNs) and | | | it\'s got to be a number. | | | | | | The DM_TAS_FORWARD_TO should be composed | | | of at most 32 bytes as variable length data. | | | | | | **Attribute Description** | | | | | | alphanumeric | | | | | | DMTAS_URIVARBYTE | +----------------------+----------------------------------------------+

unsigned short vdata_len; /* length in octets */
} DMTAS_VARBYTE;
### 8.2.8 DMTAS_VARSTRING
This is a further definition of the above named structure. It is a VARBYTE
subtype used to hold string data. Nominally these data are of type UTF-8,
although the length is still specified in bytes not characters. Being a
string, Null characters are not legal. Initially, the character set is
restricted to printable ASCII, plus white space.

### 8.2.12 DM_TAS_CALLING_ID_RESTRICT_ENUM
This is a further definition of the DM DM_TAS_CALLING_ID_RESTRICT_ENUM data.
It describes the variant of Calling ID Restriction which is in place. Note
that most of these apply to both Calling Line and Calling Name
Presentation/Restriction (CLIP/CLIR, CNIP/CNIR). This enumeration specifies
the treatment/labelling of IDs in INVITEs and responses to INVITEs.
Unsubscribed is equivalent to PERM_PUBLIC.
Table 8.2.12-1: DM_TAS_CALLING_ID_RESTRICT_ENUM

### 8.2.14 DM_TAS_CF_MODE
Enumeration of possible forward-to options for call-forwarding services.
Note that this implementation means that the forwarding options are mutually
exclusive (a single call can only be forwarded to one place), and activations
are memoryless (one can\'t activate one mode, activate a second, deactivate
the second, and expect the first mode to be used).

### 8.2.15 DM_TAS_SERVICE_ID
Enumerates the services supplied by the organic Telephony Application Server
(TAS). Many services have feature parameters in SERVICES, in addition to their
basic assigned/active status.
The enumerations are numbered, so that the bitmaps in data
(DM_TAS_SERVICE_STAT) won\'t shift when new members are added or deleted They
should stay in numeric order! Note the END entry (at the end of the list);
this can be used both as a loop boundary and in size declarations.
Empty descriptions represent proposed but not committed/defined/implemented
services. (Unused services, and holes in the numbering, are to some extent
left around to provide spares for field use, as well as biding time until the
unused service is actually implemented.) Reserved values represent ranges that
should not be reused.
If the number is listed as unused, it truly is, if thenumber is not listed,
it's also unused. The size covers all possible values, although most uses are
limited to the size implied by TAS_END_OF_SERVICES.

### 8.2.16 DM_CALL_CATEGORY
It provides most of the variants of call classification determined by Digit
Analysis, plus a few other categories. Most variants are not mutually
exclusive, so the representation is bitfields rather than an enum. When the
comment refers to \"designated\" numbers, it means digit strings entered in
the dialling plan as aliases for that service; so service providers can choose
different numbers for logical services like emergency and directory assistance
as needed to accommodate differing country conventions. This particular
structure provides category data for several different services, which is why
it isn\'t a PARM all by itself. The most obvious service is Call Barring,
which can bar many categories of call. Account codes are another using
service, as the codes can be marked as required for certain call categories.

### 8.2.17 DM_CALL_BARRING_PARM
Provides the variants of call barring (denial of outgoing calls); most
variants are not mutually exclusive, so the representation is it fields rather
than an enum. When the comment refers to \"designated\" numbers, it means
digit strings entered in the dialling plan as aliases for that service; so
service providers can choose different numbers for logical services like
emergency and directory assistance as needed to accommodate differing country
conventions.

### 8.2.19 DM_CALL_TRANSFER_PARM
This data defines variants of Call Transfer, at least one must be enabled for
the service to exist (but Multi-way calling can be used to transfer too).
Table 8.2.19-1: DM_CALL_TRANSFER_PARM
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ | Name | Description/Details | +---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ | blind | **Description** | | | | | | Network blind transfer w/dialled code; blind means no | | | checking with the transfer-to party before severing the | | | current connection.

### 8.2.20 DM_CALLING_ID_PARM
Options of Calling Identification services. This parameter covers both Calling
Number (CLIP/CLIR/CLIRO) and Calling Name (CNIP/CNIR) services, and both
originations and terminations (some interactions require knowledge of both the
origination and termination properties).
Unsubscribed action will be equivalent to public origination no caller-ID on
termination.

### 8.2.21 DM_CF_ALL_PARM
Customizing parameters for the Call Forward All (CFA) service (a.k.a. CF
Variable -- CFV or CF Unconditional CFU). This service ignores the state of
the endpoint, e.g. Busy, Idle, unregistered. The data are similar to other
call forwarding services, but the VoiceMail handling is different. In
particular, CFA/CFV is only assigned as a standalone feature - assigning
VoiceMail won\'t do it. Thus there\'s no need for a dn_fwd_ok attribute, the
service assignment bit carries that meaning.
Note that this structure is also used by the Selective Call services which may
need to do forwarding (SCF, SCA).

### 8.2.25 DM_CF_NO_RESPONSE_PARM
Service parameters for Call Forward No Response/Answer (CFDA/CFNA). Because
this feature may be assigned either for forward-to-number service or forward-
not-answered-to-voice-mail, extra bits are required inside this parameter to
indicate which services are actually allowed once this feature is assigned
(i.e. call processing must screen activation attempts based on this internal
data).
This service provides not only no-answer timing once alerting has started, but
other non-busy error responses as well (all SIP non-success responses except
486, 480 and 600, which are captured by Call Forwarding Busy).

## 8.3 XML based data description
### 8.3.1 General proposal
One option for defining the AS Service Data Description is to use XML. XML is
used over Ut interface for user configuration of the supplementary services.
For the supplementary services defined in the 3GPP TS 24.6xx series, XML
schemas are defined in each specification.
Using the service based schema definitions is thus one possibility. If this
option is selected, there is no need to invent new encodings, when the
simulated services are extended in future. With a possible increase in the
complexity of rules supported it will be increasingly difficult to maintain a
binary data model which has to accommodate for all possible combinations.
As data size may become a problem for some implementations for an XML data
set, compression is needed as an option. The simplest solution for compression
would be to use gzip. Using gzip, provides for a reasonably good compression,
in particular for larger data sizes. Using EXI is another option. It is
currently only a late draft specification, but it can be expected that this
standard will gain a more general acceptance.
Using the XML as specified in the 3GPP TS 24.6xx series and adding the option
of a standard compression algorithm provides for a simple definition of the
services data model, which will be simple to maintain. When new services with
XML schemas are defined in the future, the service data format can be taken as
is, saving design time in the standardization bodies.
### 8.3.2 Required changes to standards
To specify XML as the data format some changes are required to the Sh
interface. It is needed to separate the specified simulation services data
from any possible proprietary extensions. In order to achieve this, different
Service Indicators shall be used for
  * the services that are standardized under simulation services and defined in TS 24.6XX series
  * extension services. Different service indicators will produce different XML document (of type **tTransparentData)** that can be managed differently for the standardised services and the proprietary extension services.
The services authorization and activation information needs to be added in the
information as it currently is not specified in the simservs document. It is
also necessary to add schema for the subscription options for standardised
24.6xx series services.
A version control is needed in order to be able to handle new standard
releases. A version control element can either be defined as a version per
blob, or inside the blob. The former requires a change to Sh, but would allow
for accessing the version without opening the XML document.
# 9 Conclusions and recommendations
## 9.1 Discussion
### 9.1.1 Summary
In this Technical Report two options for standardizing the Service Data
Description have been discussed; one based on a binary data description, and
the other based on XML as specified for the simulation services. The following
table summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative
proposals.
Table 9.1.1-1: Discussion Summary
* * *
                  Binary approach                                                                                                                      XML based approach
Advantages - Efficient encoding in terms of memory\ - Allows full flexibility
in implementing services\ \- Efficient processing in terms of parsing, as
already in a form easily read by low level languages.\ - Less standardization
work for new services based on XML user service configuration. \- Optimized
when very large majority of users use only simple services
Disadvantages - Limits some services, in particular rule based combinations,
as the supported combinations need to be specified and enumerated. - Pure XML
is memory consuming\ \- XML parsing affects AS processing
* * *
### 9.1.2 Memory Consumption
A binary approach is considered to be more efficient in terms of memory
consumption. A binary approach is well optimized to handle users with simple
services. It may be argued that this is important to the HSS performance for a
network with a large proportion of users using only a few of these services.
When services become more advanced the ratio between XML memory sizes and
binary memory size become smaller as it is expected that the actual service
data takes a larger proportion of the data (as opposed to the XML containers),
e.g. a white list is a list of URIs, and these URIs may then take a larger
proportion of data irrespective of solution.
To reduce the memory size for the XML format compression may be used. The two
main alternatives would be to use either gzip, which is widely used as a
general compressor, or EXI under development by W3C as an XML based
alternative.
### 9.1.3 AS Processing Efficiency
Much the same efficiency arguments as for memory efficiency apply for the
binary approach when it comes to processing efficiency.
XML parsing affects AS processing efficiency, although there is currently a
rapid development with hardware accelerators for improved efficiency.
### 9.1.4 Service Flexibility and Interoperability Concerns
The binary approach limits the rule and condition based services to the
combinations of rules and conditions that are enumerated.
The XML approach allows full flexibility in defining the services.
Two sets of diverging arguments are:
a) For the services as defined today, as well as for possible future services,
the possibility is offered to the user (Ut Interface) to combine rules freely
in a XML document, but such flexibility with large combinational possibilities
for some service configuration by the user may be differently handled by
various TAS and generate interoperability issues.\ \ To practically ensure
interoperability between Telephony Application Servers, there should be
defined a content subset of the MMtel services to be supported by Telephony
Application Servers, optionally completed by service extensions allowing
additional flexibility or new services. Such a subset of services is also
sufficient for a large majority of users that have a simple use of services,
extensions allowing to serve other users with richer services. This is taken
into account in the binary approach.
b) It is unacceptable to standardize a data format that does not fully support
the services as they are defined. This implies that proprietary extensions are
needed in order to fulfil the services as specified.\ \ It is unclear whether
it is in CT4 remit to specify what the content subset of MMTel services should
be.\ \ The rules and conditions in an XML file are deterministic. Given a set
of rules, each consisting of a set of conditions it is well defined how to
handle them. For CDIV rules are executed in order, and a rule matches as soon
as all its conditions evaluate to true. When a rule matches the associated
action is performed and the rule evaluation is completed.
### 9.1.5 Future Standardization
The extension mechanism identified in the TR that applies to the binary
approach allows service extensions to existing services or new services
without impacting existing services.
For the binary approach addition of new services will require extra
specification of the possible combinations of rules and conditions.
For the XML based approach the service related data can be taken as is from
the service specifications, provided that the specifications continue to
contain XML schemas for the services.
For both alternatives possible new subscription options need to be specified.
Authorization and activation codes are a trivial extension regardless of data
format.
## 9.2 Recommendations
Based on the analysis done in previous sections, it is recommended:
  * to specify a definition of the IMS Telephony Supplementary service (MMTel) data understood by a variety of TASs;
  * to define a binary format for these service data in the context of Rel 8;
  * to define an XML format based on the one defined for the Supplementary Services in the 24.6xx series in the context of Rel 8;
  * for the binary format include a service description specifying the services and impacts on the IMS Telephony Supplementary services for which this approach enables interoperability. For the binary approach it shall also be described how an optional extension mechanism works that supports more complex features for some of the services, or introduces new services;
  * for the XML format, to include a possibility for compression, based on either gzip or EXI;
  * this will be complemented by the necessary mechanism for transmission over the Sh interface;
  * and finally, the inserting of this data into the Sh User Data AVP in a manner such that additional transparent data can also be transmitted.
