# Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) was been produced by ETSI Technical
Committee Telecommunications and Internet converged Services and Protocols for
Advanced Networking (TISPAN) and originally published as ETSI TS 183 033 [7].
It was transferred to the 3^rd^ Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in
December 2007.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the ETSI TISPAN endorsement of the 3GPP TS
29.228 [1] \" Cx and Dx interfaces; Signalling flows and messages contents\"
and the 3GPP TS 29.229 [2] \"IP Multimedia (IM) Subsystem Cx and Dx interfaces
based on the DIAMETER protocol; Protocol details\".
The present document provides the necessary adaptations to the above
specifications, in order to comply with the requirements of NGN Release 2.

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.

Endorsed.
##### 6 Procedure Descriptions {#procedure-descriptions .H6}

##### 6.3 Authentication procedures {#authentication-procedures .H6}
Endorsed with changes.
Modify as follows:
This procedure is used between the S-CSCF and the HSS to exchange information
to support the authentication between the end user and the home IMS network.
The procedure is invoked by the S-CSCF, corresponds to the combination of the
operations Cx-AV-Req and Cx-AV-Req-Resp (see 3GPP TS 33.203 [3]) and is used:
\- To retrieve authentication vectors from the HSS [for IMS-AKA
authentication.]{.underline}
\- To resolve synchronization failures between the sequence numbers in the UE
and the HSS [for IMS-AKA authentication.]{.underline}
**-** [To promote the result of the NASS-level authentication to the IMS
level.]{.underline}
Table 6.3.1 is endorsed with the following addition:
[When the S-CSCF performs the operation Cx-AV-Req, if it may not know the
authentication scheme at this point\ (e.g. in the non IMS-AKA cases), it can
set SIP-Number-Auth-Items to any positive value.]{.underline}
Table 6.3.2 is endorsed with the following change:
[When the S-CSCF performs the operation Cx-AV-Req, if it may not know the
authentication scheme at this point\ (e.g. in the non IMS-AKA case), it should
set the SIP-Authentication-scheme field to \"unknown\". Later the HSS changes
this value based on the actual authentication scheme stored in the user
authentication data.]{.underline}
Table 6.3.3 is endorsed with the following clarification:
[Table 6.3.3 is applicable to IMS-AKA only.]{.underline}
Table 6.3.4 is modified as follows:

# ZA.3 Additional Cx feature in support of HTTP Digest authentication
This feature is applicable for any command pair affected by NGN extensions for
HTTP Digest authentication.
When the S-CSCF and the UPSF support this feature, both nodes are able to
handle Cx messages with the extensions and/or modifications for HTTP Digest
authentication.
See table 7.1.1 in the present endorsement of 3GPP TS 29.229 [2].
