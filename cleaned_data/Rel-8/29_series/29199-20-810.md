developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardized
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].

The present document has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and The Parlay Group.
Maintenance of up to 3GPP Rel-8 and new OSA Stage 1, 2 and 3 work beyond Rel-9
was moved to OMA in June 2008.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and in 3GPP TS 29.199-1 [6] and the following apply. A term
defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the
same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
**Multicast joining:** The process by which a user joins a multicast group.
**Multicast session:** The group for providing the same multicast service. The
end user joins the multicast session to become the member of the multicast
session.
**Multicast service:** A unidirectional point-to-multipoint service in which
data is efficiently transmitted from a single source to a multicast group in
the associated multicast service area. Multicast services can only be received
by such members that are subscribed to the specific multicast service and have
joined the multicast group associated with the specific service.
**Member:** The user becomes a member of a multicast group after he/she joined
to the multicast group.
**Channel presence information: C** onsists of a set of attributes that
characterize a multicast session such as user identifiers and the multicast
session in which they are participating.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TS
29.199-1 [6] apply.

# 4 Detailed service description
The Multimedia multicast session management Web Service allows for a third
party (e.g. application) to control a multicast session, its members and
multimedia stream, and obtain channel presence information.
The Multimedia multicast session management is a simple Web Service consisting
of three interfaces:
  * **Multicast** : the management of sessions and user participation in sessions
  * **Multicast Notification** : delivering channel presence information events to the application, as users join or leave multicast sessions
  * **Multicast Notification Manager** : providing on-line set up and tear down of notifications for channel presence information events
NOTE: For control of a multimedia stream associated with a multicast session
(e.g. start/stop/pause/resume), a third party (e.g. application) invokes the
appropriate operations defined in 3GPP TS 29.199-19 [7].
The GPRS Packet network or IP Multicast Network delivers multimedia multicast
streams from a multimedia source to users who are already participating in
multicast sessions. The basic scenario is as follows:
An application creates a multicast session for personal broadcasting and plays
the multicast stream. A unique identifier (i.e. multicast address) is assigned
to the just-created multicast session. The user participating in the multicast
session for personal broadcasting may wish to invite their friends to
participate in the session. If the invited friends accept this invitation
request, they see the same program for personal broadcasting on their
terminals. They usually communicate with each other by using a multimedia over
IP while they are participating in the same session. Furthermore the
application monitors user participation status (i.e. joining or leaving the
multicast session) using a notification mechanism. For example, if a friend
has left the session, the application is notified.
