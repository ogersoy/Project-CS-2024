# 4 Overview
Interconnection between two different IM CN subsystems shall be guaranteed in
order to support end-to-end service interoperability. For this purpose, Inter-
IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) between two IM CN subsystem networks
is adopted, according to the assumptions coming from 3GPP TS 23.002 [3] and
3GPP TS 23.228 [4].
Aiming to support the delivery of IMS services between two separated IM CN
subsystems, protocol interconnection has to occur:
\- at a control plane level, in order that IMS procedures can be supported. In
this case the adopted reference point is the Ici;
\- at a user plane level, where media streams are exchanged over the Izi
reference point.
The management of IP multimedia sessions is acted by using SIP. The transport
mechanism for both SIP session signalling and media transport is IPv4 (IETF
RFC 791 [2]) or IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 [7]). The 3GPP profile of SIP defining the
usage of SIP within the IM CN subsystem is specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
Example call flows are provided in 3GPP TR 24.930 [6].
The general interconnection model is shown in Figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1: Interconnection Model for IM CN Subsystems
The possible functional entities involved in the signalling plane
interconnection (IBCF, I-CSCF, P-CSCF, BGCF and MSC Server enhanced for ICS)
and in the user plane interconnection (TrGW) are specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[5], in 3GPP TS 29.292 [35] and in 3GPP TS 29.162 [8].
IP Version interworking is described within 3GPP TS 29.162 [8].
# 5 Reference model for interconnection between IM CN subsystems
## 5.1 General
Figure 5.1 illustrates the architecture diagram given in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4]
showing the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) between two IM CN
subsystem networks.
Figure 5.1.1: Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface between two IM CN
subsystem networks
The protocols over the two reference points Ici and Izi make up the Inter-IMS
Network to Network Interface.
The Ici reference point allows IBCFs to communicate with each other in order
to provide the communication and forwarding of SIP signalling messaging
between IM CN subsystem networks. The Izi reference point allows TrGWs to
forward media streams between IM CN subsystem networks.
IMS roaming performed by using II-NNI is considered, when the IBCFs are
inserted at the network borders.
Whenever the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface is used to interconnect
two IM CN subsystem networks belonging to different security domains, security
procedures apply as described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [10].
## 5.2 Functionalities performed by entities at the edge of the network
### 5.2.1 Interconnection Border Control Function (IBCF)
An IBCF provides application specific functions at the SIP/SDP protocol layer
in order to perform interconnection between IM CN subsystem networks by using
Ici reference point. According to 3GPP TS 23.228 [4], IBCF can act both as an
entry point and as an exit point for a network.
The functionalities of IBCF are indicated in the 3GPP TS 23.228 [4] and
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]: they include:
\- network topology hiding;
\- application level gateway (for instance enabling communication between IPv6
and IPv4 SIP applications, or between a SIP application in a private IP
address space and a SIP application outside this address space);
\- controlling transport plane functions;
\- controlling media plane adaptations;
\- screening of SIP signalling information;
\- selecting the appropriate signalling interconnect;
\- generation of charging data records;
Based on local configuration, the IBCF performs transit routing functions [5].
The IBCF acts as a B2BUA when it performs IMS-ALG functionality.
### 5.2.2 Transition Gateway (TrGW)
According to 3GPP TS 23.002 [3], the TrGW is located at the network borders
within the media path and is controlled by an IBCF. Forwarding of media
streams between IM CN subsystem networks is applied over Izi reference point.
The TrGW provides functions like network address/port translation and
IPv4/IPv6 protocol translation. NAT-PT binds addresses in IPv6 network with
addresses in IPv4 network and vice versa to provide transparent routing
between the two IP domains without requiring any changes to end points.
NA(P)T-PT provides additional translation of transport identifier (TCP and UDP
port numbers). The approach is similar to that one described also in 3GPP TS
29.162 [8].
Further details are described in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4].
# 6 Control plane interconnection
## 6.1 Definition of Inter-IMS Network to Network Interconnection
### 6.1.1 SIP methods and headers
#### 6.1.1.1 General
The functional entity closest to the border of an IMS network towards an
Inter-IMS Network to Network Interconnection (see reference model in Clause 5)
shall provide the capabilities specified for that network element in Annex A.2
of TS 24.229 [5] with modifications as described in the following sub-clauses.
#### 6.1.1.2 SIP methods
3GPP TS 24.229 [5] defines the methods allowing an IBCF to interconnect to an
IBCF placed in another IM CN subsystem.
The following SIP methods are supported on the II-NNI as defined in table 6.1.

#### 6.1.1.3 SIP headers
##### 6.1.1.3.0 General
The IBCF shall provide the capabilities to manage and modify SIP headers
according to section 5.10 and Annex A of TS 24.229 [5] with modifications as
described in the following sub-clauses.
##### 6.1.1.3.1 Trust and not trust domain
In case there is a trust relationship between the two IM CN subsystems
connected by II-NNI, the IBCF acting as contact point applies the procedures
described in the section 4.4 of TS 24.229 [5], before forwarding the SIP
signalling to the next IBCF.
In case there is not a trust relationship between the two IM CN subsystems
connected by II-NNI, the IBCF acting as exit point applies the procedures
described in the section 5.10.2 of TS 24.229 [5] before forwarding the SIP
signalling to the IBCF acting as entry point. The IBCF acting as an entry
point applies the procedures described in the section 5.10.3 of TS 24.229 [5].
TS 24.229 [5] provide procedures for handling SIP headers based on trust
domain. These procedures may be utilized on a per header basis to realize
overall trust as well as per service level screening of headers. Trust
relationships and trust domains may be defined by inter-operator agreements
for individual services and/or individual SIP headers.
The management of the SIP headers (if present) over II-NNI in case of a
presence or not of a trust relationship between the two interconnected IM
subsystems is wrapped up in the following table.
Table 6.2: Management of SIP headers over II-NNI in presence or not of a trust

##### 6.1.1.3.2 Derivation of applicable SIP headers from TS 24.229
For any method in Table 6.1, the SIP headers applicable on the II-NNI are
detailed in the corresponding method tables for the UA role and proxy role
sending behaviour in Annex A of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]. Unless other information
is specified in the normative part of the present specification, the
applicability of headers at the II-NNI can be derived for each method from the
corresponding tables in Annex A of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] as follows:
\- All headers not present in the corresponding tables in Annex A of 3GPP TS
24.229 or marked as \"n/a\" in both the \"RFC status\" and \"profile status\"
columns for the UA role and proxy role sending behaviour of that tables are
not applicable at the II-NNI.
Note: Operators could choose to apply headers for new SIP extensions on an II-
NNI based on bilateral agreements, but this is outside the scope of the
present specification.
\- All headers which are marked as \"o\" in at least one of the \"RFC status\"
or the \"profile status\" profile columns for the sending behaviour in the
corresponding UA role and proxy role tables in Annex A of 3GPP TS 24.229 and
as \"n/a\" or \"o\" in the other such columns are applicable at II-NNI based
on bilateral agreement between operators.
\- All headers which are marked as \"m\" in at least one of the \"RFC status\"
or the \"profile status\" columns for the sending behaviour in the
corresponding UA role or proxy role table in Annex A of 3GPP TS 24.229 and as
\"n/a\", \"o\", or \"m\" in the other such columns are applicable at the II-
NNI.
\- If conditions are specified, they are also applicable at the II-NNI and the
above rules are applicable to the \"n/a\", \"o\" and \"m\" values within the
conditions.
Note: In the above rules, the RFC profile columns are taken into account in
order to enable interworking with non-3GPP networks,
An informative summary of SIP headers to be used over the II-NNI is proposed
in Annex A.
##### 6.1.1.3.3 Applicability of SIP headers on a roaming II-NNI
The following SIP headers are only applicable on a roaming II-NNI:
\- Authentication-Info
\- Authorization
\- P-Associated-URI
\- P-Called-Party-ID
\- P-Preferred-Service
\- P-Profile-Key
\- P-Served-User
\- P-Visited-Network-ID
\- Path
\- Proxy-Authentication
\- Proxy-Authorization
\- Service-Route
\- WWW-Authenticate
##### 6.1.1.3.4 Applicability of SIP headers on a non-roaming II-NNI

#### 6.1.1.5 Modes of signalling
Overlap signalling may be used if agreement exists between operators to use
overlap and which method to be used , otherwise enbloc shall be used at the
NNI.
### 6.1.2 SDP protocol
#### 6.1.2.1 General
The functional entity closest to the border of an IMS network towards an
Inter-IMS Network to Network Interconnection (see reference model in Clause 5)
shall provide the capabilities specified for that network element in Annex A.3
of TS 24.229 [5].
## 6.2 Control Plane Transport
### 6.2.1 General
The control plane transport of the IMS Inter-Operator Service Interconnection
Interface shall comply with Clause 4.2A of TS 24.229 [5].
Support of SCTP as specified in RFC 4168 [27] is optional for an IBCF
connected by II-NNI. Nevertheless this option is favourable if the operators
would like to improve reliability over the Ici.
# 7 User plane Interconnection
## 7.1 Media and Codec
For \"end-to-end\" media session involving the II-NNI, the SIP/SDP codec
negotiation procedure can be applied between IM CN subsystems using different
media codecs. It is possible that the end-to-end codec negotiation could fail
because no common codec could be supported by the UEs, in particular for voice
services.
To enhance interoperability, the IBCF the MRFC, or other IMS network entities
can interfere with the end-to-end codec negotiation to offer additional
codec(s) available via transcoding, or to remove codecs. The IBCF can
configure an attached TrGW to transcode, and the MRFC can configure an
attached MRFP to transcode.
Codecs applicable at the NNI may be a subject of interworking agreements.
NOTE: Possible codecs which could be used at the II-NNI are described in 3GPP
TS 26.114 [11] and ETSI TS 181 005 [12].
However, to avoid that transcoding is performed several times, applicable
codecs at the NNI should be restricted as little as possible.
NOTE: Transcoding can be performed in an IMS network serving an SDP offerer or
in an IMS network serving an SDP answerer. To avoid that transcoding is
performed multiple times, inter-operator agreements can clarify if it is
preferred that IMS network serving an SDP offerer or IMS network serving an
SDP answerer modify an SDP offer to offer transcoding.
If the IBCF performs media transcoding control, it shall apply the related
procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
## 7.2 User Plane Transport
The user plane transport of the IMS Inter-Operator Service Interconnection
Interface may use the protocols listed in Table 7.2.1. The used protocols to
transport media are negotiated by means of SDP offer/answer.

# 8 Numbering, Naming and Addressing
The following URI formats in SIP messages may be applied at the Ici as
standardized in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]:
ï‚Ÿ SIP URI defined in IETF RFC 3261 [13];
ï‚Ÿ tel URI defined in IETF RFC 3966 [14];
ï‚Ÿ IM URI defined in IETF RFC 3860 [15];
ï‚Ÿ PRES URI defined in IETF RFC 3859 [16].
Moreover, in case of MSRP sessions passing through the II-NNI, the MSRP URI
may be also used at the Ici in the SDP exchange, following the formats defined
in IETF RFC 4975 [17].
According to TS 24.229, the IBCF acting as an exit or entry point in the IMS
network supports these URI formats.
These URI formats shall be supported at the II-NNI. Other URI formats may be
supported over the II-NNI depending on the operators' policies.
A global number as defined in IETF RFC 3966 [14] shall be used in a tel-URI or
in the user portion of a SIP URI with the user=phone parameter when conveyed
via a non-roaming interface in the Request-URI and in the P-Asserted-Identity
header, except when agreement exists between the operators to also allow other
kinds of numbers.
NOTE 1: In a SIP URI the user portion of the Request-URI represents a
telephone number only if the SIP URI includes user=phone parameter.
NOTE 2: Agreements can exist between operators to allow non-global numbers
(e.g. national service numbers, business trunking numbers, or private numbers)
at a non-roaming II-NNI. A SIP URI with such a number, user=phone, and a phone
context agreed between the operators can then be used.
NOTE 3: 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] allows to restrict the number within a SIP Request-
URI with user=phone at a non-roaming II-NNI to be a global number (i.e. E.164
in international format) via an appropriate Application Server. Suitable
configuration by the operator is needed to achieve the desired modification of
the format.
NOTE 4: The allowed phone number formats in the P-Asserted-Identity header
field of a served user are configured by the operator. According to 3GPP TS
23.003 [33], international E.164 format is used within a P-Asserted-Identity
header field.
NOTE 5: The global number format usage within a SIP Request-URI with
user=phone at a non-roaming II-NNI allows the terminating network to find the
called subscriber, via HSS interrogation, without any further number
translation and thus improves the success of the interconnection between IMS
Operators.
# 9 IP Version
The network elements interconnected by means of the II-NNI may support IPv4
only, IPv6 only or both.
The support of one or both of the IP versions is an operator option and should
be based on bilateral agreement.
In case IPv4 and IPv6 networks are interconnected, the involved IBCFs and
TrGWs shall apply the IP version interworking procedures as indicated in 3GPP
TS 29.162 [8].
# 10 Security
The supported security mechanisms for IP signalling transport over II-NNI
interfaces are described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [10].
# 11 Charging
The accounting information to be supported over the Ici is described in 3GPP
TS 32.260 [29]. It shall be configurable by the operator to use or not the
accounting mechanisms provided by the IBCF.
# 12 Supplementary services associated with the IMS multimedia telephony
communication service
## 12.1 General
In order to assure the end-to-end service interoperability through the Inter-
IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI), the associated supplementary
services of the multimedia telephony communication service may be supported on
the II-NNI between the two IMS networks.
The MMTel communication service is identified by means of the media feature
tag +g.3gpp.icsi-ref set to \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel\". The
media feature tag can appear in the Contact header field, the Accept-Contact
header field and the P-Asserted-Service header field.
The support of each associated supplementary service is based on agreement
between operators.
If a supplementary service is supported, the related procedures from the 3GPP
TS 22.173 [30], the protocol details from the 3GPP TS 24.173 [31] and
specifications referenced in the later specification shall be applied with the
requirements in the relevant subclausefollowing restrictions due to the
crossing of the II- NNI.
## 12.2 Malicious Communication IDentification (MCID)
Service specific requirements in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.616 [33] shall be
supported over the II-NNI.
The INFO request and the 200 (OK) response to the INFO request containing the
application/vnd.etsi.mcid+xml body defined in 3GPP TS 24.616 [33] may be
supported at the II-NNI.
If a network terminating the dialog supports MCID, the terminating network
shall only deliver the MCID request in the mcid+xml body, as specified in the
3GPP TS 24.616 [32], if an agreement to use the MCID supplementary service
according to the 3GPP TS 24.616 [32] exists with the network originating the
dialog and if the INVITE request received by the terminating network does not
contain the information of the originating party.
NOTE: The IBCF and the AS in the terminating network interact to deliver the
MCID request only if an agreement to use the MCID supplementary service
exists, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.616 [32] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
The originating network and the terminating network shall have a bilateral
agreement to support transportation of the minimum information specified in
subclause 4.5.2.5.0 of the 3GPP TS 24.616 [33] between the networks.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Summary of SIP headers fields
A summary of the SIP headers to be used in case of interconnection by using
II-NNI is proposed in table A.1.
The starting point is the sending behaviour described for proxy and UA roles
in annex A of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]. In case of misalignment between table A.1
and the behaviour described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], the behaviour in 3GPP TS
24.229 [5] has the precedence. In case a header is not described in table A.1
and it is described in [5], description in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] is applicable
over II-NNI.
The notation of the codes used for the SIP headers listed in table A.1 has a
different meaning to the one proposed for the SIP messages. The definition of
these terms is provided in table A.2.
