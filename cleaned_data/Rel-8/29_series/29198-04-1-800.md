# 1 Scope
The present document is Part 4, Sub-part 1 of the Stage 3 specification for an
Application Programming Interface (API) for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardised
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the common definitions used by the Call Control
Service Capability Features (SCF).
This specification has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and the Parlay Group, in co-operation with a number of JAINâ„¢ Community
member companies.
Maintenance of up to 3GPP Rel-8 and new OSA Stage 1, 2 and 3 work beyond Rel-9
was moved to OMA in June 2008.

# Call Control SCF
Four flavours of Call Control (CC) APIs have been included in 3GPP Release 7.
These are Generic Call Control (GCC), Multi-Party Call Control (MPCC), Multi-
Media Call Control (MMCC) and Conference Call Control (CCC). The GCC is the
same API as was already present in the Release 99 specification (TS 29.198
v3.3.0). Multi-Party Call Contorl was introduced in the Release 4
specifications, and Multi-Media Call Control is introduced in Release 5.
Conference Call Control was introduced in Release 7.
The joint work between 3GPP CT5, ETSI TISPAN and the Parlay CC Working group
with collaboration from JAIN has been focussed on the MPCC and MMCC APIs. A
number of improvements on CC functionality have been made and are reflected in
these APIs. For this it was necessary to break the inheritance that previously
existed between GCC and MPCC.
The joint CC group has furthermore decided that the MPCC is to be considered
as the future base CC family and the technical work will not be continued on
GCC. Errors or technical flaws will of course be corrected.
## Call Model Description
The call model used for the Call Control SCFs has the following objects.
* a call object. A call is a relation between a number of parties. The call object relates to the entire call view from the application. E.g., the entire call will be released when a release is called on the call. Note that different applications can have different views on the same physical call, e.g., one application for the originating side and another application for the terminating side. The applications will not be aware of each other, all \'communication\' between the applications will be by means of network signalling. The API currently does not specify any feature interaction mechanisms.
* a call leg object. The leg object represents a logical association between a call and an address. The relationship includes at least the signalling relation with the party. The relation with the address is only made when the leg is routed. Before that the leg object is IDLE and not yet associated with the address.
* an address. The address logically represents a party in the call.
* a terminal. A terminal is the end-point of the signalling and/or media for a party. This object type is currently not addressed.
The call object is used to establish a relation between a number of parties by
creating a leg for each party within the call.
Associated with the signalling relationship represented by the call leg, there
may also be a bearer connection (e.g., in the traditional voice only networks)
or a number (zero or more) of media channels (in multi-media networks).
A leg can be attached to the call or detached from the call. When the leg is
attached, this means that media or bearer channels related to the legs are
connected to the media or bearer channels of the other legs that are attached
to the same call. I.e., only legs that are attached can \'speak\' to each
other. A leg can have a number of states, depending on the signalling received
from or sent to the party associated with the leg. Usually there is a limit to
the number of legs that are in being routed (i.e., the connection is being
established) or connected to the call (i.e., the connection is established).
Also, there usually is a limit to the number of legs that can be
simultaneously attached to the same call.
Some networks distinguish between controlling and passive legs. By definition
the call will be released when the controlling leg is released. All other legs
are called passive legs. There can be at most one controlling leg per call.
However, there is currently no way the application can influence whether a Leg
is controlling or not.
There are two ways for an application to get the control of a call. The
application can request to be notified of calls that meet certain criteria.
When a call occurs in the network that meets these criteria, the application
is notified and can control the call. Some legs will already be associated
with the call in this case. Another way is to create a new call from the
application.
## Structure of Call Control SCF Documentation
Each of the Call Control SCFs is specified under the following headings:
  * The Sequence diagrams give the reader a practical idea of how each of the SCF is implemented.
  * The Class relationships clause shows how each of the interfaces applicable to the SCF, relate to one another.
  * The Interface specification clause describes in detail each of the interfaces shown within the Class diagram part.
  * The State Transition Diagrams (STD) show transition between states in the SCF. The states and transitions are well-defined; either methods specified in the Interface specification or events occurring in the underlying networks cause state transitions.
  * The Data definitions clause shows a detailed expansion of each of the data types associated with the methods within the classes. Note that some data types are used in other methods and classes and are therefore defined within the Common Data types part of this specification (TS 29.198-2).
    1. General requirements on support of methods \------------------------------------------
An implementation of one of the call control APIs which supports or implements
a method described in one of the sub-parts of TS 29.198-04, shall support or
implement the functionality described for that method, for at least one valid
set of values for the parameters of that method.
Where a method is not supported by an implementation of a Service interface,
the exception P_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED shall be returned to any call of that
method.
Where a method is not supported by an implementation of an Application
interface, a call to that method shall be possible, and no exception shall be
returned.
  1. Application Control of a Call or Session \----------------------------------------
    1. ### Introduction
Services should be provision-able by multiple independent parties and
therefore multiple applications may apply control to the same instance of a
call or a session. How this may be enabled is further described in the
following.
However, first some reflections on what is meant with application control:
**Single application control** may be classified as to allow at the same point
in time during call or session processing only one application to be capable
to influence the call or session. This does not exclude more applications on
the same call, but they cannot operate at the same time. This is referred to
as _**"Single point of Control (SPC**)"_ in IN terminology.
**Multiple application control** may be classified as to allow at the same
point in time during call or session processing more than one application to
be capable to influence the call or session. This is referred to as
_**"Multiple Points of Control (MPC)** "_ in IN terminology.\ MPC will demand
some rules for event handling among multiple applications on a call like the
cascaded chain principle as applied in IN CS3 [8], where MPC has been
introduced.
### Concept of Multiple Points of Control
The term \"multiple points of control\" refers to the situation when multiple
concurrently executing applications apply control to one and the same instance
of a call or session.
**General Objective:**
\"If there is more than one controlling application acting on the same call or
session, then the event notification detection point processing requested by
any of the involved applications shall be performed in the same way as if
notification reporting had occurred in different call or session control
instances, which are separated by a Network Node interface\".
NOTE: The objective description above is taken from [8], but slightly
generalized to become non-IN specific.
The MPC general objective signifies the cascaded chain principle, which is
further explained below through an informative cascaded chain model.
#### Cascaded Chain Model
When services running in different nodes apply control to a call or session,
even if they are unaware of each other, they provide a cascading of
applications. They provide a natural ordering of applications. This ordering
can be said to be upstream or downstream. A downstream ordering is the
ordering of applications as they are invoked downstream in the network from
the calling party (e.g. origin client, UAC) toward the called party (e.g.
destination server, UAS). An upstream ordering is the ordering of applications
as they are invoked upstream in the network from the called party toward the
calling party.
Figure 1 : Cascaded Chain Model
When applications that apply control to one instance of a call or session are
invoked in some order, on the same node, the applications can be thought of as
cascaded.
When a \"request\" is received then the earlier the application is invoked,
based on this event, the more logically upstream it is considered to be in the
chain of cascaded applications. When a response is received then the earlier
the applications is invoked, based on this event, the more logically
downstream it is considered to be in the chain of cascaded applications.
This means that the applications are treated as if they were triggered in
different nodes (or hosts). This model is conceptually simple and may provide
a natural algorithm for resolving conflicts between the instructions of
multiple service applications at the same call or session event.
On reception of a call or session event in the network the actions are
executed in order of priority in the following manner:
1) Control is passed to the first application.
2) Some response is received from the first application.
3) Control is passed to the second application.
4) Some response is received from the second application and so on.
In this way a decision about whether to invoke a subsequent application can
depend on the output from the previous application.
If the first application terminates the request then the second application
must not be invoked.
The most simple form of cascading is an order based in which the applications
are triggered on a single event.
If for example three application \"X1\" \"Y1\" and \"Z1\" need to be triggered
on event \"e\"; then specifying an order say X1-Y1-Z1 for event e means that
first \"X1\" is contacted and its instructions taken, then the output of this
is passed to \"Y1\" and finally the output of \"Y1\" is passed to \"Z1\". (The
letter represents the application and the number an instance of the
application running for a given user.)
How about future events that should invoke the same instances of \"X\" \"Y\"
and \"Z\"? For these events there could be a totally different order,
specified say YXZ. It would however be administratively very complex if one
has to specify an order for all instances for all events. Thus a general basic
principle may be useful like the cascaded chain for defining a default
ordering in the cases where this is not possible. The actual order depends on
whether the event is coming from the calling party (downstream) or the called
party (upstream).
If however a new application A1 should be triggered on \"er\" then it would be
necessary to place this somewhere in the order. However, a default general
assumption can be that event reporting to already invoked applications should
have precedence over the invocation of new applications [8].
Anyhow, as a network operator\'s option any MPC generalized rules specified
may be replaced or enhanced by network operator specific rules.
### Service Interactions
A variety of different services, service enablers, and capabilities are being
standardized. There are potential feature interactions among these various
services, service enablers, and capabilities.
Conflicts, incompatibilities, or modifications of one feature\'s
characteristics due to interactions with another active feature need to be
resolved in case of multiple services.
In case there are multiple initial notification requests (filter criteria)
assigned for one subscriber, a priority describe the order in which the
applications shall be contacted when the call or session encounters an event
that matches the initial filter criteria. Handling of service/application
interaction issues to prevent undesired interactions when multi services are
to be supported is outside the scope of the present document. It is the basic
assumption that the network operator is responsible for the provisioning of
triggers in the network as in this domain full awareness exists of all other
services and applications.
### Multiple services - applicability of MPC for Parlay/OSA
As far as the OSA API is concerned a user can choose his clients as he wishes,
i.e. the user may subscribe to more services over the network, each one being
to a separate client application, not necessary placed in the same physical
entity.
From an OSA gateway side it is a network implementation issue if multiple or
single point of control mechanisms are supported. Multi service support
extends the number of applications that can register for notifications. An
example of multi service support network could be an OSA Gateway in a UMTS IMS
network or IN network complying with the multiple points of control principle
as defined for IN CS3.
Overlapping criteria have been defined for GCCS and MPCCS to prevent multiple
points of control, leading to possible interaction problems. Where Multi
service support is provided, the overlap criteria rules as defined to secure
single point of control can be overruled.
  1. The Service Interface Specifications ====================================
    1. Interface Specification Format \------------------------------
This clause defines the interfaces, methods and parameters that form a part of
the API specification. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is used to specify
the interface classes. The general format of an interface specification is
described below.
### Interface Class
This shows a UML interface class description of the methods supported by that
interface, and the relevant parameters and types. The Service and Framework
interfaces for enterprise-based client applications are denoted by classes
with name Ip\. The callback interfaces to the applications are denoted
by classes with name IpApp\. For the interfaces between a Service and
the Framework, the Service interfaces are typically denoted by classes with
name IpSvc\, while the Framework interfaces are denoted by classes with
name IpFw\.
### Method descriptions
Each method (API method "call") is described. Both synchronous and
asynchronous methods are used in the API. Asynchronous methods are identified
by a \'Req\' suffix for a method request, and, if applicable, are served by
asynchronous methods identified by either a \'Res\' or \'Err\' suffix for
method results and errors, respectively. To handle responses and reports, the
application or service developer must implement the relevant IpApp\ or
IpSvc\ interfaces to provide the callback mechanism.
### Parameter descriptions
Each method parameter and its possible values are described. Parameters
described as \'in\' represent those that must have a value when the method is
called. Those described as \'out\' are those that contain the return result of
the method when the method returns.
### State Model
If relevant, a state model is shown to illustrate the states of the objects
that implement the described interface.
  1. Base Interface \--------------
    1. ### Interface Class IpInterface
All application, framework and service interfaces inherit from the following
interface. This API Base Interface does not provide any additional methods.
+-------------------+ | \> | | | | IpInterface | +-------------------+ | | +-------------------+ | | +-------------------+
  1. Service Interfaces \------------------
    1. ### Overview
The Service Interfaces provide the interfaces into the capabilities of the
underlying network - such as call control, user interaction, messaging,
mobility and connectivity management.
The interfaces that are implemented by the services are denoted as \'Service
Interface\'. The corresponding interfaces that must be implemented by the
application (e.g. for API callbacks) are denoted as \'Application Interface\'.
  1. Generic Service Interface \-------------------------
    1. ### Interface Class IpService
Inherits from: IpInterface
All service interfaces inherit from the following interface.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | \> | | | | IpService | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | setCallback (appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef) : void | | | | setCallbackWithSessionID (appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef, | | sessionID : in TpSessionID) : void | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
#### Method setCallback()
This method specifies the reference address of the callback interface that a
service uses to invoke methods on the application. It is not allowed to invoke
this method on an interface that uses SessionIDs. Multiple invocations of this
method on an interface shall result in multiple callback references being
specified. The SCS shall use the most recent callback interface provided by
the application using this method. In the event that a callback reference
fails or is no longer available, the next most recent callback reference
available shall be used.
Parameters
appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef
Specifies a reference to the application interface, which is used for
callbacks.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
#### Method setCallbackWithSessionID()
This method specifies the reference address of the application\'s callback
interface that a service uses for interactions associated with a specific
session ID: e.g. a specific call, or call leg. It is not allowed to invoke
this method on an interface that does not use SessionIDs. Multiple invocations
of this method on an interface shall result in multiple callback references
being specified. The SCS shall use the most recent callback interface provided
by the application using this method. In the event that a callback reference
fails or is no longer available, the next most recent callback reference
available shall be used.
Parameters
appInterface : in IpInterfaceRef
Specifies a reference to the application interface, which is used for
callbacks.
sessionID : in TpSessionID
Specifies the session for which the service can invoke the application\'s
callback interface.
Raises
TpCommonExceptions, P_INVALID_SESSION_ID, P_INVALID_INTERFACE_TYPE
