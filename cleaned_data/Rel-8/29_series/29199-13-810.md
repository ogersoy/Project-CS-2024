The present document is Part 13 of the Stage 3 Parlay X Web Services
specification for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardized
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the Address List Management Web Service aspects
of the interface. All aspects of the Address List Management Web Service are
defined here, these being:
  * Name spaces.
  * Sequence diagrams.
  * Data definitions.
  * Interface specification plus detailed method descriptions.
  * Fault definitions.
  * Service policies.
  * WSDL description of the interfaces.
The present document has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and The Parlay Group.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 29.199-1 [6] and the following apply:
**application managed group:** group created and managed outside of the
network, requiring the group members to be passed into the network for
processing.
**group:** container for a set of addresses, it is not an address itself.\
When a group contain one or more groups, logically the group contains the set
of addresses it holds, plus the set of addresses that any contained group
holds (including any addresses contained in groups that a contained group
holds).
**group resolution:** when a group is processed by a service, it expands the
group (and any nested groups) into a set of addresses.\ The resulting set of
addresses contains no groups, and any duplicate addresses are removed. Thus, a
resolved group may be considered an exclusive union of all of its contained
members.
**network managed group:** group created and managed within a network,
allowing Web Services to reference the members of a group using the group name
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TS
29.199-1 [6] apply.
# 4 Detailed service description
The present document defines two related interfaces, one to manage the groups
themselves - creation, deletion, query and access right management. The second
interface manages the members within a group, supporting add, delete and query
operations.
Addresses are not created using this service, they must already exist.
## 4.1 Group URI format
A group URI is consistent with the style defined in RFC 2396 [7], supporting
the following URI style which is used in schemes such as sip and mailto:
scheme:dept1294\@mydivision.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
The group URI consists of the following discrete elements:
**Scheme:** selected by the provider of the group URI.
**Group name:** following the conventions of RFC 2396 [7].
**Suffix:** may be added by Service Provider (if allowed by creation
operation) to create a unique name when the Prefix + Group name already
exists.
**Sub-domain:** defined by the requester, this is contained within the domain
provided by the service provider.
**Domain:** defined by the Service Provider, and cannot be specified by the
application.
This definition of a group URI enables flexibility on the part of the Service
Provider and the Requester, while ensuring unique groups are created and
providing transparency of implementation of group storage.
The following are some group URI examples.
  * sip:salesteam\@sales.acme.anytelco.com
  * sip:salesteam1\@sales.acme.anytelco.com
  * [mailto:fieldservice\@cityofaustin.anytelco.com]{.underline}
  * group:mailroom\@bldg001.acme.anytelco.com
These examples show (1)(2) use of prefix to create unique names, (1)(3) use of
different defined schemes, and (4) use of a service provider defined scheme.
## 4.2 Address list usage in services
When a service has a requirement to support groups of address lists, it may
satisfy this requirement by utilizing network managed groups. The group URI is
passed to the service, and this group URI is resolved to the set of URIs
contained within the group. If one or more group URIs are provided in a set of
URIs to a service, the service will replace each group URI with its set of
contained URIs, and the service processing will apply to the unique union of
URIs generated.
If supported by the service policy, zero or more of the set of URIs contained
within a group may be themselves group URIs, which would also be resolved.
Thus, in this case, the list of URIs that the service would process would be
the union of individual URIs (as a set with no duplicates).
Unless specifically defined in the semantics of a service, the expected
semantic for the results of a service operation will be presented as the
results for the set of URIs as processed (the union of non-group and group
provided URIs), without group URIs included in the result. This eliminates a
variety of complexity issues including duplicate URIs in multiple groups and
the differences between a group URI and a URI referring to an endpoint.

# 8 Web Service interface definition
The Address List Management service consists of three interfaces:
  * GroupManagement which manages creation and access to groups that > hold the address lists.
  * Group which manages the content of the address list.
  * GroupMember which represents an address list entry and its > associated properties.
Together these provide the interfaces to create and manage address lists,
enabling these groups to be used by other services through this common
capability.
## 8.1 Interface: GroupManagement
The GroupManagement interface provides the administration interface for
creating, deleting, querying and managing access rights for groups. The format
of the group name is specified in the Detailed Service Description (see clause
4).
### 8.1.1 Operation: createGroup
Create a new group or list. The requester provides either:
  * The name for the group and the domain segment in which the group is to be stored. A result shall be returned with the Group URI..
> or
  * The group or list owner and group or list name / identity. The document selector shall be returned.
In the first case, a domain segment is used, since the full domain will
consist of the domain segment provided by the requester (e.g.
\'sales.mycompany\') plus a period separator (\'.\') per RFC 2396 [7] and the
domain segment provided by the Service Provider (e.g.
\'serviceprovider.com\').
To avoid name conflicts, since group URIs must be unique, an automatic naming
capability is provided which will append a suffix to the name provided if the
name is already used within the domain. If the AutoName is set to \'true\' and
the fully qualified name is not unique, then the name will have a suffix added
and the unique name will be provided in the result. For example, if the group
\'sales\@mycompany.serviceprovider.com\' was already defined, a suffix would
be added and the result could be \'sales1\@mycompany.serviceprovider.com\'. If
the AutoName is set to \'false\', then a PolicyException is thrown if the
group URI is not unique.
In the second case, the group or list belonging to the owner may be identified
either by a list URI parameter (e.g for presence lists in a SIP /IMS network)
or by a list name (e.g. for shared lists in a SIP / IMS network).
Note: In a SIP / IMS network:
  * The requester must be authorized within it
  * A service URI that identifies a list at an RLS XDMS [9] may be constructed from the values in the GroupOwner (URI) and the ListIdParameter (as a URI parameter).
  * A list at a Shared List XDMS [11] is identified by the ListName.

### 8.1.3 Operation: queryGroups
Group information can be retrieved from the network, with two types of search,
one that retrieves groups only from a single sub-domain and one that returns
groups from the sub-domain and its sub-domains.
An example demonstrates the two search types. The following example data is
used:
  * Dept123\@region1.sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
  * Dept245\@region2.sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
  * Dept348\@sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
  * Dept367\@sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
  * Dept875\@finance.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
For a search using the search domain \'sales.mycompany\', with the hierarchy
set to \'false\', the result will contain:
  * Dept348\@sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
  * Dept367\@sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
  * If the same search domain \'sales.mycompany\' is used, but the > hierarchy set to \'true\', the result will contain,
  * Dept123\@region1.sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
  * Dept245\@region2.sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
  * Dept348\@sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com
  * Dept367\@sales.mycompany.serviceprovider.com

  * POL0001: Policy error.
### 8.1.4 Operation: setAccess
Access to manage the elements within a group may be provided independently
from the access to manage the group itself. This operation enables the group
administrator to specify the requester and the operations the requester is
permitted to perform through the Group interface.
The access rights are absolute, if a requester has \'query\' access currently
and \'add\' access is to be added, then the request requires both \'add\' and
\'query\' rights to be set to \'true\'. Likewise, any right that is set to
\'false\' will be revoked.
#### 8.1.4.1 Input message: setAccessRequest

### 8.1.6 Operation: getOwnersGroups
It gets the members of existing groups / lists belonging to an owner that have
no other specific reference or domain.
The identity of the Requester is necessary for network authorization and the
identity of the GroupOwner is necessary to identify the groups / lists.
NOTE: In a SIP / IMS network, the requester must be authorized within it.

## 8.2 Interface: Group
The Group interface provides the administration interface for creating,
deleting, querying members within a group.
### 8.2.1 Operation: addMember
Add a member to a group or list. Either the Group (URI) or the Group Selector
identifies the group / list to which the new member is to be added.
If the new member is a group, and if nested group support is provided, this
will add the group URI as a reference to the list of members (it will not
expand the contents of the group within this group). A group may not be added
recursively, an attempt to do so will result in a ServiceException. To add a
group as a member of a group, the requester must have query permission on the
group to be added.
The identity of the Requester may be necessary for network authorization.
The new member may be identified by URI or by reference to an existing list
member. Alternatively, the new member may be another list or particularly a
resource list URI that is external to the existing list.
An optional display name for the new member may be provided.
NOTE: In a SIP / IMS network, the requester must be authorized within it.

### 8.2.3 Operation: deleteMember
Delete a member from a group or list. Either the Group (URI) or the Group
Selector identifies the group / list from which the member is to be deleted
The member may only be removed from this group. If nested groups are
supported, the member will not be removed from any nested group. Removal of a
group URI will remove that group URI reference from this group, it will not
delete the group.
The identity of the Requester may be necessary for network authorization.
The member to be removed may be identified by URI or by member reference.
Alternatively, the member to be removed may be a reference to an external list
or a resource list URI.

### 8.2.5 Operation: queryMembers
Get the members contained within a group or list.
The requester provides either:
  * The Group (URI) as returned from a previous createGroup request
> or
  * The group or list owner and the Group Selector
If the Group (URI) is used to identify the group / list and nested groups are
supported, then the member list may contain group URIs as members. Therefore,
two manners are supported for retrieving the list of members using the Group
(URI) - with members resolved and without.
If the Group (URI) part is used to identify the group / list, the
ResolveGroups part must be present.
  * If ResolveGroups is \'true\', then the exclusive union of all the > members contained within the group, and any nested subgroups, is > the result (exclusive union means that after retrieving all > members, duplicate members are removed).
  * If ResolveGroup is \'false\', then the group members are returned > including group URIs as members of the group. If members within > nested groups are required, subsequent calls to this operation > with those groups may be used to retrieve those members.
If the Group (URI) part is not used to identify the group / list or if nested
groups are not supported, the value of ResolveGroups is ignored.
The identity of the Requester may be necessary for network authorization and
the identity of the group / list owner may be necessary to help identify the
group / list.
NOTE: In a SIP / IMS network, the requester must be authorized within it.
