# Introduction
This clause is optional. If it exists, it is always the second unnumbered
clause.
# 1 Scope
The objective of this document is to address the Inter-IMS Network to Network
Interface (II-NNI) consisting of Ici and Izi reference points between IMS
networks in order to support end-to-end service interoperability.
The present document will address the issues related to control plane
signalling (3GPP usage of SIP and SDP protocols, required SIP headers) as well
as other interconnecting aspects like security, numbering/naming/addressing
and user plane issues as transport protocol, media and codecs actually covered
in a widespread set of 3GPP specifications.
Charging aspects will be addressed as far as SIP signalling is concerned.
The purpose of this document is to prepare some material that could be moved
to the foreseen Technical Specification for the profiling of the Inter-IMS
Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) and to propose if any needed
modifications of the 3GPP core specifications are required.

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Introduction
Interconnection between two different IM CN subsystems shall be guaranteed in
order to support end-to-end service interoperability. For this purpose, Inter-
IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) between two IM CN subsystem networks
is adopted, according to the assumptions coming from 3GPP TS 23.002 [3] and
3GPP TS 23.228 [4].
Aiming to support the delivery of IMS services between two separated IM CN
subsystems, protocol interconnection has to occur:
  * at a control plane level, in order that IMS procedures can be supported. In this case the adopted reference point is the Ici;
  * at a user plane level, where media streams are exchanged over the Izi reference point.
The management of IP multimedia sessions is acted by using SIP. The transport
mechanism for both SIP session signalling and media transport is IPv4 (IETF
RFC 791 [17]) or IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 [7]). The 3GPP profile of SIP defining
the usage of SIP within the IM CN subsystem is specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[5]. Example call flows are provided in 3GPP TR 24.930 [6].
The general interconnection model is shown in Figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1: Interconnection Model for IM CN Subsystems
The possible functional entities involved in the signalling plane
interconnection (IBCF, I-CSCF, BGCF) and in the user plane interconnection
(TrGW) are specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and in 3GPP TS 29.162 [8].
# 5 Reference model for interconnection between IM CN subsystems
## 5.1 General
Figure 5.1 illustrates the architecture diagram given in 3GPP TS 23.228 [4]
showing the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface (II-NNI) between two IM CN
subsystem networks.
Figure 5.1: Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface between two IM CN subsystem
networks
The protocols over the two reference points Ici and Izi make up the Inter-IMS
Network to Network Interface.
The Ici reference point allows IBCFs to communicate with each other in order
to provide the communication and forwarding of SIP signalling messaging
between IM CN subsystem networks. The Izi reference point allows TrGWs to
forward media streams between IM CN subsystem networks.
IMS roaming performed by using II-NNI is considered, when the IBCFs are
inserted at the network borders.
Whenever the Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface is used to interconnect
two IM CN subsystem networks belonging to different security domains, security
procedures apply as described in TS 33.210 [9].
## 5.2 Functionalities performed by entities at the edge of the network
### 5.2.1 Interconnection Border Control Function (IBCF)
An IBCF provides application specific functions at the SIP/SDP protocol layer
in order to perform interconnection between IM CN subsystem networks by using
Ici reference point. According to 3GPP TS 23.228 [4], it may act both as an
entry point and as an exit point for a network.
The functionalities of IBCF are indicated in the 3GPP TS 23.228 [4] and
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]: they include:
  * network topology hiding;
  * application level gateway (enabling communication between IPv6 and IPv4 SIP applications);
  * controlling transport plane functions;
  * screening of SIP signalling information;
  * selecting the appropriate signalling interconnect;
  * generation of charging data records;
  * inclusion of an IWF if appropriate, when interworking between different SIP profiles.
NOTE: the functionality of IWF when interworking between different protocols
(e.g., SIP and H.323) is not necessary in case of interconnection between two
IMS networks
Based on local configuration, the IBCF may perform transit routing functions
[4].
The IBCF acts as a B2BUA when it performs IMS-ALG functionality.
### 5.2.2 Transition Gateway (TrGW)
According to 3GPP TS 23.002 [3], the TrGW is located at the network borders
within the media path and is controlled by an IBCF. Forwarding of media
streams between IM CN subsystem networks is applied over Izi reference point.
The TrGW provides functions like network address/port translation and
IPv4/IPv6 protocol translation. NAT-PT binds addresses in IPv6 network with
addresses in IPv4 network and vice versa to provide transparent routing
between the two IP domains without requiring any changes to end points. NAPT-
PT provides additional translation of transport identifier (TCP and UDP port
numbers). The approach is similar to that one described also in TS 29.162 [8].
Further details are described in TS 23.228 [4].

#### 6.1.1.4 Notations of the codes
In the table 6.1 and table 6.3, the status codes m, o, c, i and n/a have the
following meanings:

#### 6.1.1.5 Modes of signalling
Overlap signalling may be used if agreement exists between operators,
otherwise enbloc shall be used at the NNI.
### 6.1.2 SDP protocol
#### 6.1.2.1 General
The functional entity closest to the border of an IMS network towards an
Inter-IMS Network to Network Interconnection (see reference model in Clause 5)
shall provide the capabilities specified for that network element in Annex A.3
of TS 24.229 [5] with modifications as described in the following sub-clauses.
## 6.2 Control Plane Transport
### 6.2.1 General
The control plane transport of the IMS Inter-Operator Service Interconnection
Interface shall comply with Clause 4.2A of TS 24.229 [5] with modifications as
described in the following sub-clauses.
NOTE: Support of SCTP as specified in RFC 4168 [x] is optional for IBCF
connected by II-NNI. Nevertheless this option is favorable if the operators
would like to improve reliability over the Ici.
# 7 User plane Interconnection
## 7.1 Media and Codec
For "end-to-end " media session involving the II-NNI, the SIP/SDP codec
negotiation procedure can be applied between IM CN subsystems using different
media codecs. It is possible that the end-to-end codec negotiation could fail
because no common codec could be supported by the UEs, in particular for voice
services.
To enhance interoperability, the IBCF could interfere with the end-to-end
codec negotiation to offer additional codec(s) the TrGW is able to transcode,
based on the interworking agreements.
NOTE: Possible codecs which could be used at the II-NNI are described in 3GPP
TS 26.114 [15] and ETSI TS 181 005 [16].
In case the codec negotiation procedure determines that the two IMS endpoints
share a common codec, the user plane may be transported through the IM CN
subsystem without being transcoded by any IM CN subsystem entity.
If a common codec is not supported by the UEs, the core IMS entities (i. e.
TrGW controlled by IBCF) may provide functionalities to provide transcoding of
the user plane.
NOTE: Possible functionalities for codec transcoding in the IBCF/TrGW should
be documented in 3GPP TS 24.229.
## 7.2 User Plane Transport
The user plane transport of the IMS Inter-Operator Service Interconnection
Interface may use the protocols listed in Table 7.1. The used protocols to
transport media are negotiated by means of SDP offer/answer.
Table 7.1: Supported transport-level RFCs to be described in SIP/SDP messages

# 8 Numbering, Naming and Addressing
The following URI formats in SIP messages may be applied at the II-NNI as
standardized in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]:
  * SIP URI defined in IETF RFC 3261 [10];
  * tel URI defined in IETF RFC 3966 [11];
  * IM URI defined in IETF RFC 3860 [12];
  * PRES URI defined in IETF RFC 3859 [13];
  * MRSP URI defined in IETF RFC 4975 [14].
The IBCF shall support these URI formats. Other URI formats may be supported
over the II-NNI depending on the operators' policies.
# 9 IP Version
The network elements interconnected by means of the II-NNI may support IPv4
only, IPv6 only or both.
The support of one or both of the IP versions is an operator option and should
be based on bilateral agreement.
In case IPv4 and IPv6 networks are interconnected, the involved IBCFs and
TrGWs shall apply the IP version interworking procedures as indicated in 3GPP
TS 29.162 [8].
# 10 Security
The supported security mechanisms for IP signalling transport over II-NNI
interfaces are described in 3GPP TS 33.210 [9].
# 11 Charging
EditorÂ´s Note: In this section impacts on existing charging and accounting
specifications will be investigated.
