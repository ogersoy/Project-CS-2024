The present document is Part 17 of the Stage 3 Parlay X Web Services
specification for Open Service Access (OSA).
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardized
interface, i.e. the OSA APIs. The concepts and the functional architecture for
the OSA are contained in 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are
contained in 3GPP TS 22.127 [2].
The present document specifies the Application-driven Quality of Service (QoS)
Web Service aspects of the interface. All aspects of the Application-driven
QoS Web Service are defined here, these being:
  * Name spaces.
  * Sequence diagrams.
  * Data definitions.
  * Interface specification plus detailed method descriptions.
  * Fault definitions.
  * Service policies.
  * WSDL Description of the interfaces.
The present document has been defined jointly between 3GPP TSG CT WG5, ETSI
TISPAN and The Parlay Group.
Maintenance of up to 3GPP Rel-8 and new OSA Stage 1, 2 and 3 work beyond Rel-9
was moved to OMA in June 2008.

ADQ Application-Driven Quality of Service
QoS Quality of Service
# 4 Detailed service description
'Application Driven QoS ' is a service which enables applications to
dynamically change the quality of service (e.g. bandwidth) available on end
user network connections. Changes in QoS may be applied on either a temporary
basis (i.e. for a defined period of time), or as the default QoS to be applied
for a user each time they connect to the network.
Applications will govern the quality of service available to the end user by
requesting that pre-defined QoS Feature profiles are applied on the end user's
connection. It is the responsibility of the Service Provider to define these
QoS Features and share them beforehand with application providers, along with
a clear indication as to which of these can be used as temporary QoS Features
and which can be used to set the default QoS on an end user connection.
The following scenarios provide example business use-cases to further
illustrate the difference between default and temporary QoS Features and when
they may be applied by the application.
{width="5.0125in" height="2.5729166666666665in"}
Figure 4.1: Example Default QoS Feature Use-Case
Figure 4.1 provides an example of where a default QoS Feature could be applied
to an end user connection.\ The scenario given shows the end user of a DSL
service requesting a permanent upgrade from their existing service offering
(e.g. 2048 kbps) to a higher bandwidth service (e.g. 8192 kbps). The
application subsequently makes a request to the ADQ web service to apply the
pre-defined 'DSL_8192' QoS Feature to the end user connection on a permanent,
or default, basis. Following successful completion of this use-case, each time
the end user's terminal equipment attaches to their DSL service, the default
QoS (in this case DSL_8192) will be applied.
{width="5.0125in" height="2.5729166666666665in"}
Figure 4.2: Example Temporary QoS Feature Use-Case
Figure 4.2 provides an example of where a temporary QoS Feature could be
applied to an end user connection.\ The scenario given shows an end user of a
DSL service who wishes to stream a piece of video content. Their current
service offering (e.g. 1024 kbps DSL) however will not support video streaming
and hence they require a temporary bandwidth upgrade for the duration of the
video stream. The streaming application then makes a request to the ADQ web
service to apply the pre-defined 'Download_QoS' QoS Feature to the end user
connection, specifying the upstream and downstream bandwidth rate and the
duration for which the temporary QoS Feature should be applied. Assuming that
the network supports the requested bandwidth rate, the end user's bandwidth
will be increased to the rate requested by the application for the specified
duration. Once the requested duration has expired, the end user's service will
resume to their original (in this example 1024 kbps bandwidth) QoS.

Figure 4.3: ADQ Web Service
The ADQ service is enabled as a Web Service interface, as depicted in figure
4.3, and will accept four logical kinds of requests from the Applications
viz.,
  * Requests to change the default quality of service available on the end user's connection,
  * Requests to change the quality of service available on the end user's connection on a temporary basis,
  * Requests to manage event registrations and
```{=html}
``` \- Self-care requests.
Applications can register with the service for notifications about network
events that affect the quality of service temporarily configured on the end
user's connection. Whenever such events occur, the Service generates
notifications to inform Applications about the impact that these events had on
the temporary QoS features set up on the end user's connection.
Self-care requests enable Applications to view transaction history and current
quality of service status.

The data types are defined in the namespace:
http://www.csapi.org/schema/parlayx/adq/v4_0
The 'xsd' namespace is used in the present document to refer to the XML schema
data types defined in XML schema [5]. The use of the name 'xsd' is not
semantically significant.
# 6 Sequence diagrams
## 6.1 Interface Flow overview
The sequence diagrams show the interaction where the Application Provider has
a Web Service compliant Application capable of sending requests to the service
and receiving notifications from the service.
Every method defined in the interface is synchronous, in the sense, that the
response to the request is instantaneous and contains the status of the
request. There is no polling required on part of the Application to determine
the status of a request.
Notifications are unsolicited. The Application will indicate their interest in
receiving notifications by registering for events. When an event occurs in the
network that merits a notification to be raised, interested Applications will
receive a notification and its implications on the temporary QoS features
active on the end user connection.
The sequence diagrams do not show the internal logic within the server
implementing this service, which is required for processing the requests. It
is assumed that such a server is capable of interacting with the network to
service requests sent by the Application.

# 8 Web Service interface definition
## 8.1 Interface: ApplicationQoS
This interface provides methods for:
  * Applying a new QoS feature to an end user connection. Either:
    * rapidly provisioning a re-grade, which results in a permanent change in the class of service provided over the end user connection
    * dynamically controlling temporary QoS features in the network which will be active for a specified period of time.

```{=html}
``` \- Self-care like operations
### 8.1.1 Operation: applyQoSFeature
This method is used by Application to request either a temporary or a default
QoS feature to be set up on the end user connection.
The **defaultQoSFeature** parameter identifies if the requested QoS Feature is
to be applied to the end user connection as the default (i.e. long-lived) QoS
Feature, or if this parameter is set to false, the requested QoS Feature shall
be applied on a temporary basis only.
Note that there is no session associated with a default QoS Feature, as it is
the permanent default QoS Feature associated with the connection until it is
replaced. A default QoS feature governs the traffic flow on the end user
connection whenever there are no temporary QoS features active on the
connection. If a default QoS Feature is replaced by an Application, it can
potentially affect other Applications, which may require a certain level of
QoS to be available on the connection when there are no active temporary QoS
Features. To achieve this, the service implementation should allow only a
Super Application (e.g. Service Provider owned) to change the default QoS
Feature of a connection. The authorization scheme required for allowing this
facility is service implementation specific and is not covered in the scope of
this specification.
For default QoS Feature requests, the value of the **modifyExistingSession**
parameter should be taken into account before applying the default QoS Feature
to the end user connection. Default QoS Features will not have any
configurable parameters.
