# 4 Signalling Flows over Gx, Gxx, Rx and S9
## 4.0 General
There are three distinct network scenarios for an IP-CAN Session:
Case 1. No Gateway Control Session is required, no Gateway Control
Establishment occurs at all (e.g. 3GPP Access where GTP-based S5/S8 are
employed.
Case 2. A Gateway Control Session is required. There are two subcases:
> 2a) The BBERF assigns a Care of Address (CoA) to the UE and establishes a
> Gateway Control Session prior to any IP-CAN session establishment that will
> apply for all IP-CAN sessions using that CoA.
>
> 2b) At IP-CAN session establishment a Gateway Control Session is required
> before the PCEF announces the IP-CAN Session to the PCRF. At BBERF change
> and pre-registration the Gateway Control Session shall match an IP-CAN
> session that the PCEF has already announced. Each IP-CAN session is handled
> in a separate Gateway Control Session.
The PCRF shall select whether case 2a or case 2b applies based on the
information received in the Gateway Control Session Establishment. For a user
identified with a Subscription-Id AVP, when the PDN identifier included as
part of the Called-Station-Id AVP is received, case 2b applies. If not
received, case 2a applies.
The following considerations shall be taken into account when interpreting the
signalling flows:
  * V-PCRF is included to also cover the roaming scenarios.
  * H-PCRF will act as a PCRF for non-roaming UEs.
  * The steps numbered as "number+letter" (e.g. "3a") will be executed, for the roaming case, instead of steps numbered as "number" (e.g. "3"), as indicated in the explanatory text below the signalling flows.
## 4.1 IP-CAN Session Establishment
This clause is applicable if a new IP-CAN Session is being established.
Figure 4.1.1: IP-CAN Session Establishment
1\. The BBERF may initiate a Gateway Control Session Establishment procedure
as defined in 4.4.1 (applicable for cases 2a during initial attach and 2b, as
defined in clause 4.0), if appropriate. In this step, the PCRF determines
whether the cases 2a or 2b applies, as defined in clause 4.0.
2\. The PCEF receives an Establish IP-CAN Session Request. The form of the
Establish IP-CAN Session Request depends upon the type of the IP-CAN. For
GPRS, the GGSN receives the first Create PDP Context Request within an IP-CAN
session. For I-WLAN, the GW receives an IPSec tunnel establishment request.
3\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home-Routed scenario, the PCEF informs the H-PCRF of the IP-CAN Session
establishment. The PCEF starts a new Gx session by sending a CCR to the H-PCRF
using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The PCEF
provides UE identity information, PDN identifier, the UE IPv4 address and/or
UE IPv6 address prefix and, if available, the IP-CAN type, RAT type and/or the
default charging method. The PCEF provides, when available, the Default-EPS-
Bearer-QoS and the APN-AMBR to the PCRF. For types of IP-CAN, where the H-PCRF
can be in control of IP-CAN Bearers, e.g. GPRS, the PCEF also provides a new
bearer identifier and information about the requested bearer, such as QoS. If
applicable for the IP-CAN type, it will also provide information to indicate
whether NW-initiated bearer control procedures are supported, if available.
The PCRF links the Gx session for the new IP-CAN session with the
corresponding Gateway Control Session as defined in clause 4.0. The PCRF
maintains aligned set of PCC and QoS rules in the PCEF and BBERF(s) as
applicable for the case.
For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 3a\~3c
are executed instead of step 3.
3a. The PCEF informs the V-PCRF of the establishment of the IP-CAN session.
The PCEF starts a new Gx session by sending a CCR to the V-PCRF with the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The parameters for CCR as
listed in step 3 are applicable here.
3b. The V-PCRF determines that the request is for a roaming user and concludes
the IP-CAN session uses visited access. V-PCRF stores the received
information.
3c. If there is not an already established S9 session for this roaming user,
the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value INITIAL_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP
within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the V-PCRF to
this IP-CAN session within the Subsession-Id AVP, and the Subsession-Operation
AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT.
> If there is an already established S9 session for this roaming user, the
> V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
> value UPDATE_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info
> AVP within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the
> V-PCRF to this IP-CAN session within the Subsession-Id AVP, and the
> Subsession-Operation AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT.
4\. The H-PCRF stores the information received in the CCR. For cases 2a and
2b, the H-PCRF links the Gx session with the Gateway Control Session(s).
NOTE 1: In the case 2a, when an additional PDN connection is established, the
Gx session is linked with the already established Gateway Control Session.
5\. If the H-PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have
it, the H-PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.
6\. The SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the
information about the allowed service(s), QoS information and PCC Rules
information.
NOTE 2: For steps 5 and 6: The details associated with the Sp reference point
are not specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber
databases is not specified in this Release.
7\. The H-PCRF selects or generates PCC Rule(s) to be installed. The H- PCRF
may also make a policy decision by deriving an authorized QoS and by deciding
whether service flows described in the PCC Rules are to be enabled or
disabled.
8\. The H-PCRF stores the selected PCC Rules. The H-PCRF selects the Bearer
Control Mode that will apply during the IP-CAN session if applicable for the
particular IP-CAN. If the H-PCRF controls the binding of IP-CAN Bearers, the
H-PCRF stores information about the IP-CAN Bearer to which the PCC Rules have
been assigned. If the BBERF/PCEF controls the binding of IP-CAN bearers, the
H-PCRF may derive the QoS information per QCI applicable to that IP-CAN
session for non-GBR bearers.
9\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home-Routed scenario, the H-PCRF provisions the PCC Rules to the PCEF using
CCA. The H-PCRF also provides the selected Bearer Control Mode if applicable
for the particular IP-CAN and if available, the QoS information per QCI. The
PCRF may also provide event triggers listing events for which the PCRF desires
PCC Rule Requests. Furthermore, the PCRF may provide authorized QoS including
the APN-AMBR and the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS.
For types of IP-CAN, where the PCRF controls IP-CAN Bearers, e.g. GPRS, the
PCRF indicates the IP-CAN Bearer where the PCC Rules are to be installed and
that the authorized QoS refers to. Otherwise, the PCRF operates without any
further reference to any specific bearer.
If online charging is applicable then the PCEF requests credit information
from the OCS over the Gy interface. If the PCEF receives credit re-
authorisation triggers from the OCS then, for case 2b, it requests the PCRF
via a CCR message to provision the triggers at the BBERF. The triggers to be
provisioned are specified in the Event-Report-Indication AVP in the CCR
message. The CSG-Information-Reporting AVP is included if already provisioned
at the PCEF.
> For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps
> 9a\~9e are executed.
9a. The PCC Rules are provisioned by the H-PCRF to the V-PCRF by using a CCA.
The H-PCRF includes PCC Rules in the Subsession-Decision AVP of the CCA, along
with the S9 subsession identifier as received in step 3c within the
Subsession-Id AVP. Other parameters listed in step 9 are also applicable here.
9b. The V-PCRF enforces visited operator policies regarding QoS authorization
requested by the H-PCRF as indicated by the roaming agreements.
9c. The V-PCRF informs the H-PCRF when a request has been denied and may
provide the acceptable QoS Information for the service.
9d. The H-PCRF acknowledges the CCR and may additionally include new or
modified PCC rules to the V-PCRF.
9e. The V-PCRF provisions PCC rules to the PCEF by using CCA. The parameters
listed in step 9a are applicable here.
NOTE 3: From this point and onward, the PCRF is responsible for keeping the
active PCC and QoS rules aligned.
10\. If case 2a or 2b applies, the PCRF aligns the set of QoS rules at the
BBERF with the set of active rules at the PCEF.
11\. The PCEF installs the received PCC Rules. The PCEF also enforces the
authorized QoS and enables or disables service flows according to the flow
status of the corresponding PCC Rules. If QoS information is received per QCI,
PCEF sets the upper limit accordingly for the MBR that the PCEF assigns to the
non-GBR bearer(s) for that QCI.
12.The PCEF sends a response to the Establish IP-CAN Session Request.\ For
GPRS, the GGSN accepts the PDP Context Request based on the results of the
authorisation policy decision enforcement. If the requested QoS parameters do
not correspond to the authorized QoS, the GGSN adjusts (downgrades /upgrades)
the requested UMTS QoS parameters to the authorized values.
NOTE 4: The PCRF can reject the IP-CAN session establishment, e.g. the PCRF
cannot obtain the subscription-related information from the SPR and the PCRF
cannot make the PCC rule decisions, as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
The PCEF can also reject the IP-CAN session establishment, e.g. there is no
activated/installed PCC rule for the IP-CAN session as specified in 3GPP TS
23.203 [2].
## 4.2 IP-CAN Session Termination
### 4.2.1 UE-Initiated
#### 4.2.1.1 AF located in the HPLMN
This clause is applicable if an IP-CAN Session is being released by the UE and
the AF is located in the HPLMN.
Figure 4.2.1.1.1: UE-Initiated IP-CAN Session Termination -- AF located in the
HPLMN
In the following procedures, the V-PCRF is included to depict the roaming
scenarios. H-PCRF acts as the PCRF for non-roaming UEs.
1\. If case 2b applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the BBERF receives a
request to remove the IP-CAN session. In case 2a, the request goes
transparently through the BBERF. In all cases, the PCEF receives a request to
remove the IP-CAN Session. The form of the Remove IP-CAN Session Request
depends upon the type of the IP-CAN. For GPRS, the GGSN receives a Delete PDP
Context Request for the last PDP context within an IP-CAN session. For I-WLAN,
the GW receives an IPSec tunnel termination request.
2\. If case 2b applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the BBERF-initiated Gateway
Control Session Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.4.4 (BBERF-
Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination) is initiated.
3\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home Routed scenario, the PCEF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF, indicating the IP-
CAN Session termination. The PCEF requests the termination of the Gx session
using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST.
For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 3a\~3b
are executed instead of step 3:
3a. The PCEF sends a CCR to the V-PCRF, indicating the IP-CAN Session
termination. The PCEF requests the termination of the Gx session using the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST.
3b. The V-PCRF sends the CCR to the H-PCRF. If case 2b or case 1 applies and
this is the last subsession associated with the S9 session, the V-PCRF sends a
CCR to the H-PCRF to request the termination of the S9 session using the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST. Otherwise, the V-PCRF
sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
UPDATE_REQUEST and a Subsession-Enforcement-Info within which the Subsession-
Operation AVP set to value TERMINATION to request the termination of the
conresponding S9 subsession.
4\. The H-PCRF identifies the AF sessions that are bound to IP flows of the
removed IP-CAN Session.
5\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF acknowledges the Gx session termination by
sending a CCA to the PCEF.
For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 5a\~5c
are executed instead of step 5:
5a. The H-PCRF acknowledges the S9 session or subsession termination by
sending a CCA to the V-PCRF.
5b. The V-PCRF removes the information related to the terminated IP-CAN
Session.
5c. The V-PCRF acknowledges the Gx session termination by sending a CCA to the
PCEF.
6\. The PCEF sends a response to the Remove IP-CAN Session Request. The form
of the Remove IP-CAN Session Response depends upon the type of the IP-CAN. For
GPRS, the GGSN sends a Delete PDP Context Response for the last PDP context
within an IP-CAN session. For I-WLAN, the GW sends an IPSec tunnel termination
response. Step 6 may be executed in parallel with step 3 or 3a (as
applicable).
For each AF session identified in step 4 as bound to the IP-CAN Session being
removed, steps 7-10 are executed:
7\. The H-PCRF indicates the session abort to the H-AF by sending an ASR to
the H-AF.
8\. The H-AF responds by sending an ASA to the H-PCRF.
9\. The H-AF sends an STR to the H-PCRF to indicate that the session has been
terminated.
10\. The H-PCRF responds by sending an STA to the H-AF.
11\. If case 2a applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the Gateway Control and
QoS Rules Provision procedure as defined in clause 4.4.3 (Gateway Control and
QoS Rules Provision) may be initiated to remove the QoS rules associated with
the IPâ€‘CAN session being terminated. This applies e.g. in case the Gateway
Control Session remains to serve other IPâ€‘CAN sessions.
Alternatively, if UE acquires a care of address (CoA) that is used for the S2c
reference point and the H-PCRF determines that all QoS rules are to be removed
and the Gateway Control Session to be terminated, the PCRF-initiated Gateway
Control Session Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.4.4 (PCRF-
Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination) is initiated. This applies e.g.
in case the UE is detached and the CoA acquired by the UE is not used for any
other IPâ€‘CAN session.
12\. The H-PCRF sends a cancellation notification request to the SPR if it has
subscribed such notification. Step 12 may be initiated any time after step 5
or 5a (as applicable).
13\. The SPR sends a response to the H-PCRF.
NOTE 3: For steps 12 and 13: The details associated with the Sp reference
point are not specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing
subscriber databases is not specified in this Release.
#### 4.2.1.2 AF located in the VPLMN
This clause is applicable only for the Visited Access scenario for the case
when an IP-CAN Session is being released by the UE and the AF is located in
the VPLMN.
Figure 4.2.1.2.1: UE-Initiated IP-CAN Session Termination -- AF located in the
VPLMN
If the AF resides in the VPLMN, the Vâ€‘PCRF proxies AF session signalling over
S9 between the V-AF and the Hâ€‘PCRF.
1\. In order to perform UE initiated IP-CAN Session Termination Procedures,
step 1 thru step 6: as specified in Figure 4.2.1.1.1 : UE Initiated IP-CAN
Session Termination - AF Located in the HPLMN are executed.
For each AF session identified in step 4 (Figure 4.2.1.1.1) as bound to the
IP-CAN Session beingremoved steps 2-9 are executed:
2\. The H-PCRF indicates the session abort to the V-AF in VPLMN by sending an
ASR to the V-PCRF.
3\. The V-PCRF proxies the ASR to the V-AF.
4\. The V-AF responds by sending an ASA to the V-PCRF.
5\. The V-PCRF proxies the ASA to the H-PCRF.
6\. The V-AF sends an STR to the V-PCRF to indicate that the session has been
terminated.
7\. The V-PCRF proxies the STR to the H-PCRF.
8\. The H-PCRF responds by sending an STA to the V-PCRF.
9\. The V-PCRF proxies the STA to the V-AF.
10\. Step 11 thru step 13: as specified in Figure 4.2.1.1.1 : UE Initiated IP-
CAN Session Termination - AF Located in the HPLMN are executed, as needed.
NOTE : For step 10: the details associated with the Sp reference point are not
specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber databases
is not specified in this Release.
### 4.2.2 PCEF-Initiated
#### 4.2.2.1 AF located in the HPLMN
This clause is applicable if an IP-CAN Session is being released by the PCEF
and the AF is located in the HPLMN.
Figure 4.2.2.1.1 : PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Termination --- AF located in
the HPLMN
In the following procedures, the V-PCRF is included to depict the roaming
scenarios. H-PCRF acts as the PCRF for non-roaming UEs.
1\. The PCEF detects that the termination of an IP-CAN Session or bearer is
required.
2\. If case 2b applies (as defined in clause 4.0), PCEF sends the Remove IP-
CAN Session Request to the BBERF.
If case 2a applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the request goes transparently
through the BBERF. In all cases, the PCEF sends a Remove IP-CAN Session
Request to remove the IP-CAN Session. The form of the Remove IP-CAN Session
Request depends upon the type of the IP-CAN. It can consist of separate
requests for each IP-CAN Bearer within an IP-CAN Session. For GPRS, the GGSN
sends a separate Delete PDP Context Requests for each of the PDP contexts
within an IP-CAN session. For I-WLAN, the GW sends an IPSec tunnel termination
request.
3\. If case 2b applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the BBERF-initiated Gateway
Control Session Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.4.4 (BBERF-
Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination) is initiated.
4\. The PCEF receives a response to the Remove IP-CAN Session Request. For
GPRS, the GGSN receives a Delete PDP Context Response for each PDP context
within the IP-CAN session. For I-WLAN, the GW receives an IPSec tunnel
termination response.
5 - 7. Same as Steps 3\~5 in figure 4.2.1.1.1.
8-14. Same as Steps 7\~13 in figure 4.2.1.1.1.
NOTE 1: Steps 2 and 5 may be executed in parallel.
#### 4.2.2.2 AF located in the VPLMN
This clause is applicable only for the Visited Access scenario for the case
when an IP-CAN Session is being released by the PCEF and the AF is located in
the VPLMN
Figure 4.2.2.2.1: PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Termination -- AF located in
the VPLMN
If the AF resides in the VPLMN, the Vâ€‘PCRF proxies AF session signalling over
S9 between the V-AF and the Hâ€‘PCRF.
1\. In order to perform PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Termination Procedures,
step 1 through step 7: as specified in Figure 4.2.2.1.1: PCEF Initiated IP-CAN
Session Termination - AF Located in the HPLMN are executed.
For each AF session identified in step 6 (Figure 4.2.2.1.1) as bound to the
IP-CAN Session being removed, steps 2-9 are executed:
2\. The H-PCRF indicates the session abort to the V-AF in VPLMN by sending an
ASR to the V-PCRF.
3\. The V-PCRF proxies the ASR to the V-AF.
4\. The V-AF responds by sending an ASA to the V-PCRF.
5\. The V-PCRF proxies the ASA to the H-PCRF.

IP-CAN Session Termination - AF Located in the HPLMN are executed, as needed.
NOTE : For step 10: the details associated with the Sp reference point are not
specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber databases
is not specified in this Release.
### 4.2.3 PCRF-Initiated
#### 4.2.3.1 AF located in the HPLMN
This clause is applicable if an IP-CAN Session is being released by the PCRF
and the AF is located in the HPLMN.
Figure 4.2.3.1.1: PCRF-initiated IP-CAN Session Termination -- AF located in
HPLMN
In the following procedures, the V-PCRF is included to depict the roaming
scenarios. H-PCRF acts as the PCRF for non-roaming UEs.
1\. The H-PCRF detects that the termination of an IP-CAN Session is required.
2\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF sends a RAR including the Session-Release-
Cause AVP to request that the PCEF terminates the IP CAN session.
For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 2a\~2b
are executed instead of step 2:
2a. If case 2b or case 1 applies and the subsession being terminated is the
last subsession over S9, the H-PCRF sends a RAR including the Session-Release-
Cause AVP to the V-PCRF to indicate the termination of the S9 session.
Otherwise, the H-PCRF sends a RAR to the V-PCRF including the Subsession-
Decision-Info AVP with the Session-Release-Cause AVP to indicate the request
for terminating the S9 subsession corresponding to the IP-CAN session.
2b. The V-PCRF sends a RAR including the Session-Release-Cause AVP to the
PCEF.
3\. The PCEF removes all the PCC Rules which are applied to the IP CAN
session.
4\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home Routed scenario, the PCEF sends a RAA to acknowledge the RAR.
For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 4a\~4b
are executed instead of step 4:

## 4.3 IP-CAN Session Modification
### 4.3.1 Network-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
#### 4.3.1.1 Interactions between BBERF, PCEF and PCRF(PCC/QoS Rule
Provisioning in PUSH mode)
This flow shows the provisioning of PCC/QoS Rules and/or authorized QoS
triggered by an event in the PCRF.
Figure 4.3.1.1.1: Interactions between BBERF, PCEF and PCRF for PCRF-Initiated
IP-CAN Session Modification
1\. The H-PCRF receives an internal or external trigger to re-evaluate PCC
Rules and policy decision for an IP-CAN Session. Possible external trigger
events are described in clause 4.3.1.2.
2\. The H-PCRF selects the PCC Rule(s) to be installed, modified or removed
for the IP-CAN Session. The H-PCRF may also update the policy decision by
defining an authorized QoS and enable or disable the service flow(s) of PCC
Rules. If the PCEF controls the binding of IP-CAN bearers, the H-PCRF may add
or change QoS information per QCI applicable to that IP-CAN session.
3\. The H-PCRF stores the updated PCC Rules.
4\. Step 4 is only applicable if the Bearer Control Mode (BCM) selected is UE-
only or, for UE/NW the H-PCRF determines that UE mode applies for the affected
PCC Rules, and the PCRF receives an external trigger from the AF.
The PCRF may start a timer to wait for a UE requested bearer resource
initiation, modification or removal procedure initiated by the UE, as depicted
in figure 4.3.2.1.1.
If a UE requested bearer resource initiation, modification or termination
procedure initiated by the terminal is received for the affected PCC rules
while the timer is running, all subsequent steps in the present figure shall
not be executed and, for case 1, the steps in figure 4.3.2.1.1 (on
provisioning based on PULL procedure at PCEF -initiated IP-CAN session
modification when the AF is located in the HPLMN), 4.3.2.2.1 (on provisioning
based on PULL procedure at PCEF-initiated IP-CAN session modification when the
AF is located in the VPLMN) and for cases 2a and 2b, the steps in figure
4.4.2.1.1 (Home Routed case) or 4.4.2.2.1 (Visited Access case) shall be
executed instead.
Otherwise, if the BCM selected is UE/NW, the PCRF shall proceed with the
subsequent steps (provisioning based on PUSH procedure) in the present figure
after timer expiry.
5\. For case 2a and 2b, if Gxx applies for the IP-CAN session and the user is
not roaming, or the user is roaming in a Home Routed scenario or a Visited
Access scenario for case 2a when the available QoS rule are not related to any
IP-CAN session, the H-PCRF may initiate Gateway Control and QoS rules
provisioning procedures described in clause 4.4.3.
6\. The H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to request that the PCEF installs,
modifies or removes PCC Rules and updates the policy decision.
When the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 6a \~ 6e are
executed instead of step 6:
6a. The H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to the V-PCRF to request that the PCEF
installs, modifies or removes PCC Rules and updates the policy decision.
6b. The V-PCRF enforces visited operator policies regarding PCC rules
requested by the H-PCRF based on roaming agreements or locally configured
policy.
NOTE: If the V-PCRF rejects provisioned PCC rules received from the H-PCRF,
the remaining steps in this call flow are not followed. Instead, the V-PCRF
shall notify the H-PCRF by sending a Diameter RAA, including the Experimental-
Result-Code AVP set to the value PCC_RULE_EVENT, identify the failed PCC rules
as specified in TS 29.212 [9], and additionally may provide the acceptable QoS
Information for the service.
6c. For case 2a and 2b, V-PCRF will derive the QoS rules from the PCC rules.
The V-PCRF will initiate a Gateway Control and QoS Rule procedure as described
in clause 4.4.3 to install, modify or remove QoS rules and optionally
subscribe to new events in the BBERF.
6d. The BBERF installs, modifies or removes the identified QoS Rules. The
BBERF also enforces the authorized QoS of the corresponding QoS Rules.
6e. The V-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to request that the PCEF installs,
modifies or removes PCC Rules.
7\. The PCEF installs, modifies or removes the identified PCC Rules. The PCEF
also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow
according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules. If QoS
information is received per QCI, PCEF shall set/update the upper limit for the
MBR that the PCEF assigns to the non-GBR bearer for that QCI.
8\. The PCEF sends a Diameter RAA to acknowledge the RAR. The PCEF informs the
H-PCRF about the outcome of the PCC rule operation
When the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 8a \~ 8d are
executed instead of step 8:
8a. The BBERF informs the V-PCRF about the outcome of the operation by sending
a Diameter RAA command.
8b. The PCEF informs the V-PCRF about the outcome of the PCC rule operation by
sending a Diameter RAA command.
8c. The V-PCRF stores the received information.
8d. The V-PCRF informs the H-PCRF about the outcome of the operation by
sending a Diameter RAA command.
> 9\. When Gxx does not apply for the IP-CAN session, IP-CAN bearer signalling
> is executed separately for each IP-CAN bearer under the following
> conditions:
\- if all PCC rules bound to a bearer have been removed or deactivated (bearer
deactivation is applicable)
\- if one or more bearers have to be modified
\- if the PCEF needs to establish a new bearer (bearer establishment is
applicable).

This flow shows the provisioning of PCC Rules and/or authorized QoS triggered
by the PCEF.
Figure 4.3.2.1.1: PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification. AF in HPLMN.
1\. For case 2a and 2b, the BBERF may initiate Gateway Control and QoS rules
request procedure described in clause 4.4.2.
2\. The PCEF may receive a request for IPâ€‘CAN Session modification. The IP-CAN
session modification can be initiated upon receiving UE-initiated resource
modification request (case 1), a new IP-CAN bearer establishment signalling
(case 1), due to a specific event (e.g. UE requested PDN connectivity in all
cases) or an internal trigger.
3\. The PCEF informs the H-PCRF about the IP-CAN session modification for non-
roaming case and Home-Routed roaming scenario. The PCEF sends a CCR command to
the H-PCRF including the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
"UPDATE_REQUEST". For an IP-CAN Session modification where an existing IP-CAN
bearer is modified, the PCEF supplies the specific event that caused the IP-
CAN Session modification within the Event-Trigger AVP and the PCC rule name(s)
and their status within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP. In the case where the UE
initiates a resource modification request procedure, the PCEF includes the
Packet-Filter-Information AVP, Packet-Filter-Operation AVP and QoS-Information
AVP, if applicable.
When the UE is roaming in a Visited Access case, steps 3a \~ 3c are executed
instead of step 3:
3a. The PCEF sends a Diameter CCR to the V-PCRF to request PCC Rules for the
roaming user. The parameters listed in step 3 are applicable here.
3b. The V-PCRF stores the information received in the Diameter CCR from the
PCEF.
3c. The V-PCRF sends a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to
"UPDATE_REQUEST" to the H-PCRF. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-
Enforcement-Info AVP and the assigned S9 subsession identifier within
Subsession-Id AVP. The Subsession-Operation AVP is set to the value
"MODIFICATION".
4\. If the H-PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have
it, the PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.
5\. The SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the
information about the allowed service(s) and PCC Rules information.
NOTE: For steps 4 and 5: The details associated with the Sp reference point
are not specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber
databases is not specified in this Release.
6\. If the AF requested a notification of the corresponding event, the H-PCRF
sends a Diameter RAR with the Specific-Action AVP set to indicate the event
that caused the request.
7\. If step 6 takes place, the AF may take the application specific procedure
(e.g. for IMS refer to 3GPP TS 24.229[5]), replies with a Diameter RAA and may
provide updated service information within. Additionally, the AF may terminate
the Rx session as per clause 4.3.1.2.3.
8-11. If all service data flows for an AF session are deleted, the AF session
is terminated.
12\. The H-PCRF selects or generates PCC Rule(s) to be installed. The H-PCRF
may also identify existing PCC rules that need to be modified or removed. The
PCC Rules may relate to any of the matching AF sessions or may exist in the
PCRF without matching to any AF session. The H-PCRF may also make a policy
decision by deriving an authorized QoS and by deciding whether service data
flows described in the PCC Rules are to be enabled or disabled.
13\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home-Routed scenario, the H-PCRF provisions the PCC Rules to the PCEF using
CCA command. The H-PCRF also provides the selected Bearer Control Mode, if
changed and applicable for the IP-CAN type. The PCRF may also provide a new
list of event triggers for which the PCRF requires to be notified. The PCRF
may provide QoS information within the APN-AMBR AVP and the Default-EPS-
Bearer-QoS AVP.
When the UE is roaming in a Visited Access, steps 13a \~13c are executed
instead of step 13:
13a. The H-PCRF sends a Diameter CCA to the V-PCRF including the PCC Rules to
be provisioned within the Subsession-Decision AVP, along with the S9
subsession identifier as received in step 3b. within the Subsession-Id AVP.
Other parameters listed in step 9 are also applicable here.
13b. The V-PCRF validates the QoS parameters requested within the PCC Rules
and enforces visited operator policies regarding QoS authorization requested
by the H-PCRF as indicated by the roaming agreements.
NOTE: If the V-PCRF rejects provisioned PCC rules received from the H-PCRF,
the remaining steps in this call flow are not followed. Instead, the V-PCRF
shall notify the H-PCRF by sending a Diameter CCR, including the Experimental-
Result-Code AVP set to the value PCC_RULE_EVENT, identify the failed PCC rules
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.215 [22], and additionally may provide the
acceptable QoS Information for the service.
13c. The V-PCRF provisions PCC rules to the PCEF by using CCA command. The
parameters listed in step 13a are applicable here.

VPLMN
Figure 4.3.2.2.1: PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification, AF in VPLMN.
If the AF resides in the VPLMN, the Vâ€‘PCRF proxies the AF session signalling
over S9 between the V-AF and the Hâ€‘PCRF.
1\. Steps 1 to 5 in figure 4.3.2.1.1 are executed.
When all PCC Rules related to a particular AF session are removed, the H-PCRF
initiates the AF session termination procedure. For each AF session bound to
the modified IP-CAN session that is being removed, steps 2-9 are executed
instead of steps 10-13:
2\. The H-PCRF indicates the session abort to the V-PCRF by sending a Diameter
ASR to the V-PCRF
3\. The V-PCRF proxies the Diameter ASR command to the V-AF
4\. The V-AF responds by sending a Diameter ASA command to the V-PCRF
5\. The V-PCRF proxies the ASA command to the H-PCRF
6\. The V-AF sends a Diameter STR command to the V-PCRF to indicate that the
session has been terminated
7\. The V-PCRF proxies the Diameter STR command to the H-PCRF
8\. Th The V-PCRF proxies the Diameter STA command to the V-AF
9\. The H-PCRF responds by sending a Diameter STA command
When the H-PCRF receives event triggers related to specific actions that the
AF has subscribed to, the H-PCRF initiates the AF session modification
procedure to notify the AF of these specific actions. For each AF session
bound to the modified IP-CAN session that has subscribed to these specific
actions, steps 10-13 are executed instead of steps 2-9:
10\. If the H-PCRF is notified of an event in the access network that has to
be notified to the V-AF for an AF session, the H-PCRF informs of the event by
sending a RAR command to the V-PCRF.
11\. The V-PCRF proxies the RAR command to the V-AF.
12\. The V-AF responds by sending a RAA command to the V-PCRF
13\. The V-PCRF proxies the RAA to the H-PCRF
14\. Steps 12 to 17 in figure 4.3.2.1.1 are executed.
## 4.4 Gateway Control Session Procedures
There are two kinds of Gateway Control (GC) sessions:
  * A Gateway Control session that serves a single IP-CAN session (e.g. S-GW/BBERF connecting to PDN-GW using S5/S8 PMIP according to 23.402 [22]).
  * A Gateway Control session that serves all the IP-CAN sessions from the same Care-of address of the UE (e.g. a UE connecting to PDN-GW using S2c according to TS 23.402 [22]).
These Gateway Control sessions are initiated in connection with IP-CAN session
establishment and Initial Attach respectively. For the first case, the PCRF
will identify that the GC session serves a single IP-CAN session based on the
PDN Identifier received in the request.
An access network may support mobility with BBERF change. The new BBERF shall
establish new Gateway Control sessions according to the procedures defined for
the new access type and the PCRF shall correlate those sessions with ongoing
IP-CAN sessions as part of the handover procedure.
These scenarios are shown separately in different flows.
In the following procedures, the V-PCRF is included to depict the roaming
scenarios. H-PCRF will act as a PCRF for non-roaming UEs.
### 4.4.1 Gateway Control Session Establishment
Figure 4.4.1.1: Gateway Control Session Establishment.
1\. The BBERF receives a message or indication that it needs to establish a
Gateway Control session.\ For case 2a, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF
detects that a UE has been assigned a Local IP address that the UE may use as
a Care-of Address in MIP registrations (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [21], clause 6.3).\
For case 2b, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF detects that the UE requests
an IP-CAN session to be established (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [21], clauses 4.5.2
and 5.6.1) or, at BBERF relocation, to be resumed with a certain APN (see 3GPP
TS 23.402 [21], clauses 5.7.1 and 5.7.2) or the UE requests a pre-registration
with this BBERF (see TS 23.402 [21], clause 9.3.1).
2\. For the non-roaming case, the BBERF initiates a Gateway Control session
with the H-PCRF by sending a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP
set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The BBERF provides UE identity information
and the IP-CAN type.\ For case 2a, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF
provides the CoA assigned to the UE.\ For case 2b, as defined in clause
4.0,the BBERF provides the PDN identifier and, if applicable, a Session-
Linking-Indicator to indicate if the session linking has to be deferred. The
BBERF provides, when available, the APN-AMBR and Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS.
If applicable for the IP-CAN type, the BBERF additionally provides Network-
Request-Support AVP to indicate whether NW-initiated procedures are supported.
When the UE is roaming, the steps 2a-2c are executed instead of step 2:
2a. The BBERF initiates a Gateway Control session with the V-PCRF by sending a
CCR to the V-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
INITIAL_REQUEST. The BBERF provides UE identity information and the IP-CAN
type.\ For case 2a, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF provides the CoA
assigned to the UE.\ For case 2b, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF provides
the PDN identifier and, if applicable, a Session-Linking-Indicator AVP to
indicate if the session linking has to be deferred. The BBERF provides, when
available, the APN-AMBR and Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS.
If applicable for the IP-CAN type, the BBERF additionally provides Network-
Request-Support AVP to indicate whether NW-initiated procedures are supported.
2b. The V-PCRF determines based on the UE identity information that the
request is for a roaming user. The V-PCRF checks whether the V-PCRF needs to
send the CCR to the H-PCRF based on the roaming agreements. For the Visited
Access case, the V-PCRF does not send the CCR to the H-PCRF if the Session-
Linking-Indicator AVP was received indicating that the session linking has to
be deferred.
NOTE: If the V-PCRF does not send the CCR to the H-PCRF, the PCRF may generate
QoS rules based on VPLMN roaming agreements.
2c. For case 2a:
\- If there is not an already established S9 session for this roaming user,
the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value INITIAL_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes in the CCR the information received

necessary.
4c. The V-PCRF acknowledges the session termination by sending a Diameter CCA
message to the BBERF.

# 5 Binding Mechanism
## 5.1 Overview
The binding mechanism associates the session information with the IP-CAN
bearer that is intended to carry the service data flow.
The binding mechanism includes three steps as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [4]:
1\. Session binding.
2\. PCC Rule authorization and QoS Rule generation.
3\. Bearer binding.
The Session Binding function receives the Session Information and determines
the relevant IP-CAN session. With this information the PCC Rule Authorization
and QoS Rule generation function runs the policy rules and constructs the PCC
rule(s) and if applicable, the QoS rule(s) if the authorization is granted.
Finally the Bearer Binding function selects the IP-CAN bearer where the PCC
rule(s) or QoS rule(s) should be installed within the IP-CAN session already
known.
PCC Rule Authorization and QoS Rule generation function and Bearer Binding
function can take place without Session Binding at certain IP-CAN Session
events (e.g. IP-CAN Session Establishment).
## 5.2 Session Binding
Session binding is the association of the AF session information to an IP-CAN
session.
When the PCRF accepts an AA-Request from the AF over the Rx interface with
service information, the PCRF shall perform session binding and associate the
described service IP flows within the AF session information (and therefore
the applicable PCC rules) to an existing IP-CAN session. This association is
done comparing the user IP address received via the Rx interface in either the
Frame-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP with the IPv4 address or
IPv6 prefix received via the Gx interface. The UE Identity if present in the
Subscription-Id AVP and the PDN information if available in the Called-
Station-Id AVP may also assist on this association.
The PCRF will determine that the UE has an IP-CAN session if the IP address
(IPv4 or IPv6) received over the Rx interface matches the IPv4 address or IPv6
prefix received via one or more of the following interfaces: Gx interface and
S9 interface, and if the UE identity is used to assist the association, the UE
identity received over the Rx interface matches the UE identity received via
one or more of the following interfaces: Gx interface and S9 interface.
NOTE 1: In case the UE identity in the IP-CAN and the application level
identity for the user are of different kinds, the PCRF needs to maintain, or
have access to, the mapping between the identities. Such mapping is not
subject to specification within this TS.
NOTE 2: An IPv6 address provided over Rx matches an IPv6 prefix provided over
Gx or S9 if the IPv6 address belongs to the IPv6 (sub-)network prefix.
As a result from the session binding function, the PCRF identifies what IP-CAN
session the current AF session is related with. If the PCRF is not capable of
executing the Session Binding, the PCRF shall issue an AA-Answer command to
the AF with a negative response.
## 5.3 PCC Rule Authorization and QoS Rule Generation
The PCRF shall perform the PCC rule authorization and QoS rule generation when
the PCRF receives session information from an AF over Rx interface, when the
PCRF receives notification of IP-CAN session events (e.g. establishment,
modification) from the PCEF over Gx or S9 interface, or when the PCRF receives
IP-CAN events from the BBERF over Gxa/Gxc inferface. The PCRF shall also
perform PCC Rule Authorization and QoS rule generation for dynamic PCC Rules
already provisioned to the PCEF and dynamic QoS rules already provisioned to
the BBERF due to internal PCRF triggers (e.g. policies are included or
modified within PCRF).
If the PCRF receives any traffic mapping information from the BBF that does
not match any service data flow filter, the PCRF shall also perform PCC and/or
QoS rule authorization when the UE's subscriber profile allows subscription
based authorization. In this case, the PCRF shall treat the received traffic
mapping information as if it is service data flow filter information.
The PCRF assigns appropriate QoS parameters (QCI, ARP, GBR, MBR, etc.) to each
PCC or QoS rule.
The PCRF authorizes the affected PCC rules and /or QoS rules after successful
Session Binding. By the authorization process the PCRF will determine whether
the user can have access to the requested services and under what constraints.
If so, the PCC rules and QoS rules are created or modified. If the Session
Information is not authorized, a negative answer shall be issued to the AF by
sending an AA-Answer command.
The PCRF assigns an appropriate QCI to each PCC or QoS rule. IP-CAN specific
restrictions and other information available to the PCRF (e.g. users
subscription information, operator policies) shall be taken into account. Each
PCC or QoS rule shall receive a QCI that can be supported by the IP-CAN. The
PCRF shall ensure consistency between the QoS rules and PCC rules authorized
for the same service data flow when QoS rules are derived from corresponding
PCC rules.
In roaming scenarios, the V-PCRF may further authorize the rules received from
the H-PCRF based on local operator policy. Depending on the local policy, the
V-PCRF may change the authorized QoS for the affected rules. If local
authorization of the rules fails, the V-PCRF shall issue a negative answer to
the H-PCRF.
## 5.4 Bearer Binding
The Bearer Binding function is responsible for associating a PCC rule and QoS
rule (if applicable) to an IP-CAN bearer within the IP-CAN session. The QoS
demand in the rule, as well as the service data flow template, is input to the
bearer binding. The selected bearer shall have the same QCI and ARP as the one
indicated by the PCC or QoS rule.
The Bearer Binding Function (BBF) is located either at the BBERF or at the
PCEF.
The PCRF shall supply the PCC rules to be installed, modified or removed over
Gx interface to PCEF. If there are gateway controls sessions associated with
the Gx session, the PCRF shall also supply the QoS rules to be installed,
modified, or removed over Gxa/Gxc interface to the BBERF.
The BBF shall then check the QoS class identifier and ARP indicated by the
rule and bind the rule with an IP-CAN bearer that has the same QoS class
identifier and ARP. The BBF shall evaluate whether it is possible to use one
of the existing IP-CAN bearers or not and, if applicable, whether to initiate
IP-CAN bearer modification or not. If none of the existing bearers are
possible to use, the BBF should initiate the establishment of a suitable IP-
CAN bearer.
NOTE: For an IP-CAN, limited to a single IP-CAN bearer per IP-CAN session, the
bearer is implicit, so finding the IP-CAN session is sufficient for successful
bearer binding.
NOTE: The handling of a rule with MBR>GBR is up to operator policy (e.g. an
independent IP-CAN bearer may be maintained for that SDF to prevent unfairness
between competing SDFs).
NOTE: The QCI and ARP (including the Priority-Level, Pre-emption-Capability
and Pre-emption-Vulnerability) are used for the bearer binding. Depending on
operator policy, only the QCI and ARP Priority-Level can be used for bearer
binding. In such a case, it is left to operator policy to determine whether
different PCC rules with the same QCI and ARP Priority-Level but different
Pre-emption-Capability and Pre-emption-Vulnerability can be bound to the same
bearer.
For an IP-CAN, where the BBF gains no information on what IP-CAN bearer the UE
selects to send an uplink IP flow on, the binding mechanism shall assume that,
for bi-directional service data flows, both downlink and uplink packets travel
on the same IP-CAN bearer.
Whenever the service data flow template, the QoS authorization or the
negotiated traffic mapping information change, the existing bearer bindings
shall be re-evaluated. The re-evaluation may, for a service data flow, require
a new binding with another IP-CAN bearer.
During PCC/QoS rules enforcement, if packet filters are provided to the UE,
the BBF shall provide packet filters with the same content as that in the SDF
template filters received over the Gx/Gxx interface from the PCRF within the
Flow-Description or the Flow-Information AVP. The representation/format of the
packet filters provided by the network to the UE is access-system dependent
and may vary between accesses and also may be different from that of the SDF
template filter on the Gx/Gxx interface.
Requirements specific for each type of IP-CAN are defined in the IP-CAN
specific Annex. The Bearer Binding Function may also be located in the PCRF
(e.g. as specified in Annex D for GPRS running UE only IP-CAN bearer
establishment mode). Selection of the Bearer Binding location shall be based
on the Bearer Control Mode selected by the PCRF.
# 6 QoS Parameters Mapping
## 6.1 Overview
Several QoS parameters mapping functions are needed during PCC interaction.
These functions are located at the AF, PCRF, PCEF and UE. The main purpose of
these mapping functions is the conversion of QoS parameters from one format to
another. Examples of QoS information are:
\- Parts of a session description language (SDI), e.g. SDP.
\- IP QoS parameters.
\- Access specific QoS parameters.
One QoS mapping function is located at the AF, which maps the application
specific information into the appropriate AVPs that are carried over the Rx
interface.The AF derives information about the service from the SDI or from
other sources. The mapping is application specific. If SDP (IETF RFC 2327[11])
is used as SDI, the AF should apply the mapping described in Clause 6.2. For
IMS, the mapping rules in Clause 6.2 shall be used at the P-CSCF. The AF
passes service information to the PCRF over the Rx interface. Clause 6.2
specifies the QoS parameter mapping functions at the AF applicable for all IMS
P-CSCFs regardless of the access technology.
One QoS mapping function is located at the PCRF, which maps the service
information received over the Rx interface into IP QoS parameters (e.g. QCI,
GBR, MBR, ARP, ...). This mapping is access independent. Clause 6.3 specifies
the QoS mapping functions at the PCRF applicable for all accesses.
The other mapping functions located at PCEF, BBERF, and UE are implementation
dependent and are not specified within this specification except for GPRS
case.
The PCRF notes and authorizes the IP flows described within this service
information by mapping from service information to Authorized IP QoS
parameters for transfer to the PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx interface. Both the
PCEF and BBERF will map from the Authorized IP QoS parameters to the access
specific QoS parameters. For GPRS, the GGSN acting as PCEF will map from the
Authorized IP QoS parameters to the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters.
The general QoS mapping framework is shown in figure 6.1.1.
NOTE 1: The AF can derive the Service information from the AF session
signalling.
NOTE 2: Service Information on Rx interface to Authorized IP QoS parameters
mapping.
NOTE 3: For the UE initiated bearer setup, the UE may derive IP QoS
parameters, requested Access-Specific QoS parameters mapping and Authorized
Access-Specific QoS parameters from the AF session signalling.
NOTE 4: Authorized IP QoS parameters to Authorized Access-Specific QoS
parameters mapping.
NOTE 5: Access Specific QoS parameters with Authorized Access-Specific QoS
parameters comparison.
Figure 6.1.1: Framework for QoS mapping
### 6.1.1 UE-Initiated IP-CAN bearers
This clause covers the case where the UE is capable to initiate/modify the IP-
CAN bearers sending requests to the PCEF/BBERF. When a UE desires to
establish/modify an IP-CAN bearer the following steps are followed:
1\. The AF can map from SDI within the AF session signalling to service
information passed to the PCRF over the Rx interface. (see clause 6.2).
2\. The PCRF shall map from the service information received over the Rx
interface to the Authorized IP QoS parameters that shall be passed to the
PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx interface. The mapping is performed for each IP
flow. Upon a request from the PCEF/BBERF, the PCRF combines per direction the
individual Authorized IP QoS parameters per flow (see clause 6.3).
3\. The UE derives access specific QoS parameters, e.g. UMTS QoS parameters,
and, if an IP BS manager is present, IP QoS parameters from the AF session
signalling in an application specific manner. The IP and access specific QoS
parameters should be generated according to application demands.\ \ For GPRS,
the recommendations for conversational (3GPP TS 26.236 [7]) or streaming
applications (3GPP TS 26.234 [6]) should also be taken into account when the
UE derives the IP and UMTS QoS parameters. If SDP is used as SDI, e.g. for
IMS, the UE should apply clause 6.5.1.and should also apply mapping rules for
the authorised QoS parameters in clause 6.5.2 to derive the maximum values for
the different requested bit rates and traffic classes. In case the UE
multiplexes several IP flows onto the same PDP Context, it has to combine
their IP and UMTS QoS parameters. If an IP BS manager is present, the
Translation/Mapping function maps the IP QoS parameters to the corresponding
UMTS QoS parameters.
4\. The PCEF/BBERF shall map from the Authorized IP QoS parameters received
from PCRF to the Authorized access specific QoS parameters.
> For GPRS. the GGSN shall map to the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters (see
> clause 6.4.1.1).
5\. The PCEF/BBERF shall compare the requested access specific QoS parameters
against the authorized access specific QoS parameters.
> For GPRS, the GGSN shall compare the UMTS QoS parameters of the PDP context
> against the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters (see clause 6.4.1.2).
The mapping that takes place in the UE and the network should be compatible in
order to ensure that the PCEF will be able to correctly authorize the session.
Figure 6.1.1.1 shows the different kind of QoS parameters in the different
points of QoS mapping figure. Due to the UE requests, there are bidirectional
flows between the UE and the PCRF.
Figure 6.1.1.1: QoS mapping for UE initiated IP CAN bearers
### 6.1.2 Network-Initiated IP-CAN bearers
When the IP-CAN session supports Network-Initiated bearers, the network sets
up IP CAN bearer(s) with a suitable QoS. If the type of IP CAN supports such
an indication, the network indicates to the terminal the QoS characteristics
of those IP-CAN bearer(s). Therefore the flow of QoS related information will
be unidirectional as indicated in the figure 6.1.2.1.
EMBED Word.Picture.8
Figure 6.1.2.1: QoS mapping for network initiated IP CAN bearers
1\. The AF can map from SDI within the AF session signalling to service
information passed to the PCRF over the Rx interface (see clause 6.2).
2\. The PCRF shall map from the service information received over the Rx
interface to the Authorized IP QoS parameters that shall be passed to the
PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx interface. The mapping is performed for each IP
flow. Upon a request from the PCEF/BBERF, the PCRF combines per direction the
individual Authorized IP QoS parameters per flow (see clause 6.3).
3\. The PCEF/BBERF shall map from the Authorized IP QoS parameters received
from PCRF to the access specific QoS parameters. For GPRS. the GGSN shall map
to the UMTS QoS parameters (see clause 6.4.1.1).
## 6.2 QoS parameter mapping Functions at AF
The mapping described in this clause is mandatory for the P-CSCF and should
also be applied by other AFs, if the SDI is SDP.
When a session is initiated or modified the P-CSCF shall use the mapping rules
in table 6.2.1 for each SDP media component to derive a Media-Component-
Description AVP from the SDP Parameters. The mapping shall not apply to media
components where the SDP payload is proposing to use a circuit-switched bearer
(i.e. \"c=\" line set to \"PSTN\" and an \"m=\" line set to \"PSTN\", refer to
3GPP TS 24.292 [24]). Circuit-switched bearer related media shall not be
included in the service information sent to the PCRF.

## 6.3 QoS parameter mapping Functions at PCRF
The QoS authorization process consists of the derivation of the parameters
Authorized QoS Class Identifier (QCI), Allocation and Retention Priority
(ARP), and Authorized Maximum/Guaranteed Data Rate UL/DL.
When a session is initiated or modified the PCRF shall derive Authorized IP
QoS parameters (i.e. QCI, Authorized Maximum/Guaranteed Data Rate DL/UL, ARP)
from the service information. If the selected Bearer Control Mode (BCM) is UE-
only this process shall be performed according to the mapping rules in table
6.3.1 to avoid undesired misalignments with the UE QoS parameters mapping.
In the case of forking, the various forked responses may have different QoS
requirements for the IP flows of the same media component. Each Authorized IP
QoS Parameter should be set to the highest value requested for the IP flow(s)
of that media component by any of the active forked responses.

The PCRF should per ongoing session store the Authorized IP QoS parameters per
for each IP flow or bidirectional combination of IP flows (as described within
a Media Subcomponent AVP).
If the PCRF provides a QoS-Information AVP within a Charging-Rule-Definition
AVP it may apply the rules in table 6.3.2 to combine the Authorized QoS per IP
flow or bidirectional combination of IP flows (as derived according to table
6.3.1) for all IP flows described by the corresponding PCC rule.
If the PCRF provides a QoS-Information AVP for an entire IP CAN bearer (for a
UE-initiated IP-CAN bearer in the GPRS case) or IP CAN session, it may apply
the rules in table 6.3.2 to combine the Authorized QoS per IP flow or
bidirectional combination of IP flows (as derived according to table 6.3.1)
for all IP flows allowed to be transported within the IP CAN bearer or
session. It is recommended that the rules in table 6.3.2 are applied for all
IP flows with corresponding AF session. The PCRF may increase the authorized
QoS further to take into account the requirements of predefined PCC rules
without ongoing AF sessions.
NOTE: QoS-Information AVP provided at IP-CAN session level is not derived
based on mapping tables, but based on subscription and operator specific
policies.
NOTE: Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP is always calculated at PCC rule level
according to table 6.3.2.
For a UE initiated PDP context within GPRS, the PCRF applies the binding
mechanism described in Clause 5 to decide which flows are allowed to be
transported within the IP CAN bearer.

#### 6.4.1.2 Comparing UMTS QoS Parameters against the Authorized UMTS QoS
parameters in GGSN for UE initiated PDP context
Upon receiving a PDP context activation, the GGSN requests PCC rules from the
PCRF (see 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] for details). The PCRF may supply Authorized IP
QoS Parameters per PDP context together with the PCC rules. The GGSN maps the
Authorized IP QoS parameters per PDP Context to Authorized UMTS QoS parameters
according to clause 6.4.1.1 and then compares the requested UMTS QoS
parameters against the corresponding Authorized UMTS QoS parameters. The
following criteria shall be fulfilled:
\- If the requested Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL (if the requested Traffic Class
is Conversational or Streaming) is equal to the Authorized Guaranteed data
rate DL/UL; and
\- the requested Maximum Bitrate DL/UL (if the requested Traffic Class is
Interactive or Background) is equal to Maximum Authorized data rate DL/UL; and
\- the requested Traffic Class is equal to Maximum Authorized Traffic Class.
Then, the GGSN shall accept the PDP context activation or modification with
the UE requested parameters.Otherwise, the GGSN is adjusted (downgrade or
upgrade) the requested UMTS QoS parameters to the values that were authorized.

#### 6.4.2.2 Comparing UMTS QoS Parameters against the Authorized UMTS QoS
parameters in P-GW for UE initiated PDP context
Upon receiving a PDP context activation, the P-GW requests PCC rules from the
PCRF (see 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] for details). The PCRF may supply Authorized IP
QoS Parameters applicable for the provided PCC rules. The P-GW calculates the
Authorized IP QoS parameters per bearer and maps the Authorized IP QoS
parameters per bearer to Authorized UMTS QoS parameters according to clause
6.4.2.1 and then compares the requested UMTS QoS parameters against the
corresponding Authorized UMTS QoS parameters. The following criteria shall be
fulfilled:
\- If the requested Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL (if the requested Traffic Class
is Conversational or Streaming) is equal to the Authorized Guaranteed data
rate DL/UL; and
\- the requested Maximum Bitrate DL/UL (if the requested Traffic Class is
Interactive or Background) is equal to Maximum Authorized data rate DL/UL; and
\- the requested Traffic Class is equal to Maximum Authorized Traffic Class.
Then, the P-GW shall accept the PDP context activation with the UE requested
parameters.Otherwise, the P-GW shall accept the request and adjust (downgrade
or upgrade) the requested UMTS QoS parameters to the values that were
authorized.
## 6.5 QoS parameter mapping Functions at UE for a UE-initiated GPRS PDP
Context
Figure 6.5.1 indicates the entities participating in the generation of the
requested QoS parameters when the UE activates or modifies a PDP Context. The
steps are:
1\. The Application provides the UMTS BS Manager, possibly via the IP BS
Manager and the Translation/Mapping function, with relevant information to
perform step 2 or step 4. (Not subject to standardization within 3GPP).
2\. If needed, information from step 1 is used to access a proper set of UMTS
QoS Parameters. See 3GPP TS 26.236 [7] for Conversational Codec Applications
and 3GPP TS 26.234 [6] for Streaming Codec Applications.
3\. If SDP is available then the SDP Parameters should give guidance for the
UMTS BS Manager (possibly via the IP Manager and the Translation/Mapping
function) ,according to the rules in clause 6.5.1, to set the Maximum Bitrate
UL/DL and the Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL. Furthermore the Maximum Authorized
Bandwidth UL/DL and Maximum Authorised Traffic Class should be derived
according to the rules in clause 6.5.2.
4\. A set of UMTS QoS Parameters values from step 2 (or directly from step 1)
is possibly merged together with the Maximum Bitrate UL/DL and the Guaranteed
Bitrate UL/DL from step 3. The result should constitute the requested UMTS QoS
Parameters. The UE should check that the requested Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL or
requested Maximum Bitrate UL/DL (depending on the requested Traffic Class)
does not exceed the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL derived in step 3.
Furthermore, if the UE has implemented the mapping rule for Maximum Authorized
Traffic Class, as defined in clause 6.5.2, the UE should check that the
requested Traffic Class does not exceed the Maximum Authorised Traffic Class
derived in step 3.
Figure 6.5.1: Framework for generating requested QoS parameters in the UE
### 6.5.1 SDP to UMTS QoS parameter mapping in UE
If SDP Parameters are available, then before activating or modifying a PDP
Context the UE should check if the SDP Parameters give guidance for setting
the requested UMTS QoS Parameters. The UE should use the mapping rule in table
6.5.1.1 to derive the Maximum and Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL from the SDP
Parameters.
Table 6.5.1.1: Recommended rules for derivation of the requested Maximum\ and
Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL per media component in the UE
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | UMTS QoS Parameter per media | Derivation from SDP Parameters | | component | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | **Maximum Bitrate DL/UL and\ | /* Check if the media use | | Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL per | codec(s) */\ | | media component** | IF [(\ = (\"audio\" or | | | \"video\")) and (\ = | | | \"RTP/AVP\")] THEN\ | | | \ | | | /* Check if Streaming */\ | | | IF a= (\"sendonly\" or | | | \"recvonly\") THEN\ | | | Maximum Bitrate DL/UL and | | | Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL per | | | media component as specified in | | | reference [6] ;\ | | | /* Conversational as default | | | !*/\ | | | ELSE\ | | | Maximum Bitrate DL/UL and | | | Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL per | | | media component as specified in | | | reference [7] ;\ | | | ENDIF ;\ | | | \ | | | /* Check for presence of | | | bandwidth attribute for each | | | media component */\ | | | ELSEIF b=AS:\ | | | is present THEN\ | | | IF media stream only downlink | | | THEN | | | | | | Maximum Bitrate DL = Guaranteed | | | Bitrate DL =\; | | | | | | ELSEIF mediastream only uplink | | | THEN | | | | | | Maximum Bitrate UL = Guaranteed | | | Bitrate UL =\; | | | | | | ELSEIF mediastreams both | | | downlink and uplink THEN | | | | | | Maximum Bitrate DL = Guaranteed | | | Bitrate DL =\; | | | | | | Maximum Bitrate UL = Guaranteed | | | Bitrate UL =\; | | | | | | ENDIF; | | | | | | ELSE\ | | | \ | | | /* SDP does not give any | | | guidance ! */\ | | | Maximum Bitrate DL/UL and | | | Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL per | | | media component as specified by | | | the UE manufacturer;\ | | | ENDIF ; | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
### 6.5.2 SDP parameters to Authorized UMTS QoS parameters mapping in UE
If the PDP Context is activated or modified the UE should use the mapping
rules in table 6.5.2.1 for all applications using SDP to derive the Maximum
Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL per IP flow or bidirectional combinations of IP
flows.
Table 6.5.2.1 also has a mapping rule for derivation of Maximum Authorized
Traffic Class per IP flow or bidirectional combinations of IP flows which
applies for session initiation and modification.
In future releases this mapping rule may change.
In the case of forking, the various forked responses may have different QoS
requirements for the same IP flows of a media component. When the Authorized
UMTS QoS Parameters are used by the UE, they shall be set equal to the highest
values requested for the IP flows of that media component by any of the active
forked responses. The UE should use the mapping rule in table 6.5.2.1 for each
forked response.
Table 6.5.2.1: Rules for derivation of the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth DL/UL
and\ the Maximum Authorized Traffic Class per IP flow or bidirectional
combination of IP flows in the UE

The UE should per ongoing session store the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters per
IP flow or bidirectional combination of IP flows.
Before activating or modifying a PDP context the UE should check that the
requested Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL (if the Traffic Class is Conversational or
Streaming) or the requested Maximum Bitrate UL/DL (if the Traffic Class is
Interactive or Background) does not exceed the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth
UL/DL per PDP context (calculated according to the rule in table 6.5.2.2). If
the requested Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL or the requested Maximum Bitrate UL/DL
exceeds the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL per PDP context, the UE should
reduce the requested Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL or the requested Maximum Bitrate
UL/DL to the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL per PDP context. Furthermore,
if the rule in table 6.5.2.1 for calculating Traffic Class per IP flow or
bdirectional combination of IP flows is implemented, the UE should check that
the requested UMTS QoS parameter Traffic Class does not exceed the Maximum
Authorized Traffic Class per PDP context (calculated according to the rule in
table 6.5.2.2). If the requested UMTS QoS parameter Traffic Class exceeds the
Maximum Authorized Traffic Class per PDP context, the UE should reduce the
requested UMTS QoS parameter Traffic Class to the Maximum Authorized Traffic
Class per PDP context.

# 7 PCRF addressing
## 7.1 General
The PCRF discovery procedures are needed where more than one PCRF is present
in an operator's network realm. Within such a deployment, an additional
functional element, called DRA, is needed. PCRF discovery procedures include
all the procedures that involve a DRA functional element.
Routing of Diameter messages from a network element towards the right Diameter
realm in a PLMN is based on standard Diameter realm-based routing, as
specified in IETF RFC 3588 [14] using the UE-NAI domain part. If PLMN is
separated into multiple realms based on PDN information or IP address range
(if applicable); the PDN information available in the Called-Station-Id AVP,
or the UE's IPv4 address available in the Framed-IP-Address AVP or the UE's
IPv6 address or prefix provided within the Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP may be used
to assist routing PCC message to the appropriate Diameter realm.
The DRA keeps status of the assigned PCRF for a certain UE and IP-CAN session
across all reference points, e.g. Gx, Gxx, S9 and Rx interfaces.
The DRA shall support the functionality of a proxy agent and a redirect agent
as defined in RFC 3588 [14]. The mode in which it operates (i.e. proxy or
redirect) shall be based on operator's requirements.
Diameter clients of the DRA, i.e. AF, PCEF, BBERF and PCRF in roaming
scenarios shall support all procedures required to properly interoperate with
the DRA in both the proxy and redirect modes.
NOTE: The proxy mode includes two variants:
PA1: Proxy agent based on the standard Diameter proxy agent functionality. All
the messages need to go through the DRA.
PA2: Proxy agent based on the standard Diameter proxy agent functionality.
Session establishment messages always go through the DRA. Gx, Gxx and S9
session termination messages always go through the DRA. All other messages
bypass the DRA.
## 7.2 DRA Definition
The DRA (Diameter Routing Agent) is a functional element that ensures that all
Diameter sessions established over the Gx, S9, Gxx and Rx reference points for
a certain IP-CAN session reach the same PCRF when multiple and separately
addressable PCRFs have been deployed in a Diameter realm. The DRA is not
required in a network that deploys a single PCRF per Diameter realm.
## 7.3 DRA Procedures
### 7.3.1 General
A DRA implemented as a Diameter Redirect Agent or a Diameter Proxy Agent shall
be compliant to IETF RFC 3588 [14], except when noted otherwise in this
document.
### 7.3.2 DRA Information Storage
The DRA shall maintain PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session or per UE-
NAI, depending on the operator's configuration.
The DRA shall select the same PCRF for all the Diameter sessions established
for the same UE in case 2a.
As there\'s only one S9 session per UE, the V-DRA/H-DRA shall select the same
V-PCRF/H-PCRF respectively for the same UE in the roaming case.
The DRA has information about the user identity (UE NAI), the UE IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix, the APN(if available)and the selected PCRF address for a
certain IP-CAN Session .
The PCRF routing information stored for an IP-CAN session in the DRA shall be
removed after the IP-CAN session is terminated. In case of DRA change (e.g.
inter-operator handover), the information about the IP-CAN session stored in
the old DRA shall be removed.
The PCRF routing information stored per UE in the DRA may be removed when no
more IP-CAN and gateway control sessions are active for the UE.
### 7.3.3 Capabilities Exchange
In addition to the capabilities exchange procedures defined in IETF RFC 3588
[14], the Redirect DRA and Proxy DRA shall advertise the specific applications
it supports (e.g., Gx, Gxx, Rx or S9) by including the value of the
application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the
3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP
contained in the Capabilitiesâ€‘Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands.
### 7.3.4 Redirect DRA
#### 7.3.4.1 Redirecting Diameter Requests
A DRA implemented as a Diameter redirect agent shall redirect the received
Diameter request message by carrying out the procedures defined in section
6.1.7 of IETF RFC 3588 [14]. The Client shall use the value within the
Redirect-Host AVP of the redirect response in order to obtain the PCRF
identity. The DRA may provide the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP in the redirect
response to provide a hint to the Client about how the cached route table
entry created from the Redirect-Host AVP is to be used as described in section
6.13 of IETF RFC 3588 [14].
The two most revelant redirect host usage scenarios for PCC from IETF RFC 3588
[14] are:
\- If the PCRF routing information is per UE-NAI, the DRA shall set the
Redirect-Host-Usage AVP to ALL_USER. The DRA client may contact the DRA on IP-
CAN session termination.
\- If the PCRF routing information is per IP-CAN session, the DRA shall set
the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP to ALL_SESSION. The DRA client shall contact the
DRA on IP-CAN session termination.
The DRA may also provide the Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVP in the redirect
response to indicate to the Client the lifetime of the cached route table
entry created from the Redirect-Host and Redirect-Host-Usage AVP values as
described in section 6.14 of IETF RFC 3588 [14].
If the DRA is maintaining PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session, the DRA
shall be aware of Gx and Gxx Diameter termination requests as defined in 3GPP
TS 29.212 [9] in order to detect whether release of DRA bindings is required.
Otherwise the DRA clients shall use cached route table entry created from the
Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs to
determine whether DRA interaction is required.
The DRA shall be aware of IP-CAN Session modification requests over Gx which
is to update the IPv4 address of the UE by the PCEF.
If the client is the AF, the DRA (redirect) does not need not to maintain
Diameter sessions and Diameter Base redirect procedures are applicable.
Therefore, an AF should not send an AF session termination request to the DRA
#### 7.3.4.2 DRA binding removal
If the DRA binding is per IP-CAN session and the IP-CAN session is terminated
or if the DRA binding is per UE and the last IP-CAN session is terminated (eg.
from an indication by the BBERF/PCEF) the Redirect DRA shall remove the
associated DRA binding information and responds with a Diameter redirect
answer message.
### 7.3.5 Proxy DRA
The DRA shall support the functionality of a Diameter proxy agent as defined
in RFC 3588 [14].
When the DRA receives a request from a client, it shall check whether it
already has selected a PCRF for the UE or the UE's IP-CAN session; if it does
have a PCRF already selected for that UE or UE's IP-CAN session, it shall
proxy the request to the corresponding PCRF. If the request is an IP-CAN
session termination or gateway control session termination, the DRA shall
check whether PCRF routing information shall be removed as specified in
section 7.3.3. If the DRA does not have a PCRF already selected, it shall
follow one of the procedures below:
\- If the request is an IP-CAN session establishment or gateway control
session establishment, it shall select a PCRF to handle all sessions for that
UE or UE's IP-CAN session. It shall then proxy the request to the selected
PCRF.
\- Otherwise, if the request is not an IP-CAN session establishment or gateway
control session establishment, it shall reject the request.
NOTE: An error code which is returned in this case is not specified in the
present Release.
If a DRA is deployed in a PCRF's realm, clients of the DRA shall send the
first request of a session to the DRA handling the PCRF's realm. Clients of
the DRA shall as well send IP-CAN session termination and gateway control
termination requests to the DRA. A client of the DRA shall be capable of
sending every message of a session to the DRA. A client of the DRA may be
configured to bypass the DRA on session modification messages and AF session
termination messages by sending these types of messages directly to the PCRF.
### 7.3.6 PCRF selection by BBERF/PCEF (non-roaming case)
The PCEF (e.g. P-GW) or BBERF (e.g. Non-3GPP Access, S-GW) shall provide the
DRA of the PCRF realm with identity parameters upon the first interaction
between the access entity and the PCRF realm.
If the redirect agent is used for DRA, the DRA shall use the redirecting
requests procedure as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [14], and include the PCRF
address (Diameter Identity) in the Redirect-Host AVP in the Diameter reply
sent to the PCEF or the BBERF.
If proxy agent is used for DRA, the DRA should use the proxy procedure as
specified in IETF RFC 3588 [14]. For PA2 solution (described in clause 7.1),
only session establishment, session modification with the UE's IPv4 address
updated and session termination messages shall be sent through the DRA.
The identity parameters from the PCEF or BBERF may comprise the UE's IPv4
address in the Framed-IP-Address AVP,and/or the UE's IPv6 prefix in the
Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP, PDN information in the Called-Station-Id AVP and user
identity in the Subscription-Id AVP.
### 7.3.7 PCRF selection by AF
If the AF has the realm identification (i.e. FQDN from a UE NAI) and is
located in the H-PLMN, the AF sends the user identity in the Subscription-Id
AVP and PDN information (i.e. APN) if available in the Called-Station-Id AVP
in a Diameter request to the DRA which acts as a Diameter agent.
If the AF does not have proper knowledge about the user identity and the AF is
located in the HPLMN, the AF may use pre-configured information to find the
DRA.
NOTE: How the AF which is a third party or non-IMS application server finds
the DRA if it does not have the proper knowledge about the user identity is
out of scope of this specification.
The AF shall provide the DRA of the PCRF realm with identity parameters upon
the first interaction between the AF and the PCRF realm.
If redirect agent is used for DRA, the DRA shall use the redirecting requests
procedure as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [14], and include the PCRF address
(Diameter Identity) in the Redirect-Host AVP in the Diameter reply sent to the
AF.
If proxy agent is used for DRA, the DRA should use the proxy procedure as
specified in IETF RFC 3588 [14]. For PA2 solution (described in clause 7.1),
only AF session establishment messages shall be sent through the DRA.
The parameters from the AF may comprise the UE IP address in either the
Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP, PDN information in the
Called-Station-Id AVP and user identity in the Subscription-Id AVP (3GPP TS
23.203 [2]).
### 7.3.8 PCRF selection in a roaming scenario
In the roaming case, a V-DRA is needed in the visited PLMN when there are more
than one PCRFs per realm. The V-DRA will ensure that all the related Diameter
sessions for a UE are handled by the same V-PCRF.
The BBERF in the visited access and home routed cases, the PCEF in the case of
visited access and the AF when located in the visited PLMN may use pre-
configured information (e.g. based on PDN) to find the V-DRA, and then find
theV-PCRF. Other possible options are Dynamic peer discovery, or DNS-based.
The V-PCRF can find the H-DRA based on the UE NAI, and then find the H-PCRF by
the H-DRA.
The V-PCRF shall provide the H-DRA of the H-PCRF realm with identity
parameters upon the first interaction between the V-PCRF and the H-PCRF realm.
If redirect agent is used for H-DRA, the H-DRA shall use the redirecting
requests procedure as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [14], and include the H-PCRF
address ( Diameter Identity) in the Redirect-Host AVP in the Diameter reply
sent to the V-PCRF.
If proxy agent is used for H-DRA, the H-DRA should use the proxy procedure as
specified in IETF RFC 3588 [14]. For PA2 solution (described in clause 7.1),
only session establishment, session modification with the UE's IPv4 address
updated and termination messages shall be sent through the H-DRA.
The identity parameters from the V-PCRF may comprise the same parameters sent
by the PCEF or the BBERF to the V-PCRF, i.e. the user identity (UE NAI), APN,
the UE's IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix (3GPP TS 23.203 [2]).
If redirect agent or PA2 is used for H-DRA, and the V-PCRF receives
establishment message from the AF in the VPLMN, the V-PCRF may send the
message to the H-PCRF directly (e.g. based on the stored information provided
by H-DRA during the IP-CAN session establishment).
## 7.4 DRA flows
### 7.4.1 Proxy DRA
#### 7.4.1.1 Establishment of Diameter Sessions
##### 7.4.1.1.1 Non-roaming cases
Establishment of Diameter sessions may occur at any of the following cases:
\- Gateway control establishment
\- IP-CAN session establishment
\- AF session establishment
Figure 7.4.1.1.1.1: Establishment of Diameter sessions using DRA (proxy)
1\. A Client receives an external trigger (e.g. IP-CAN session establishment
request) that requires the establishment of a Diameter session with a PCRF.
2\. A Diameter Request (e.g. a Diameter CCR sent by PGW to indicate
establishment of an IP-CAN session as defined in clauses 4.5.1, 4a.5.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client and received by a DRA (proxy).
3\. The DRA (proxy) stores the user information (e.g. UE-NAI) and checks
whether an active DRA binding exists. If not, the DRA creates a dynamic DRA
binding (assignment of a PCRF node per UE or per IP-CAN session).
NOTE: When the AF establishes an Rx session with the DRA, there is already a
DRA binding active
4\. The DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Request to the target PCRF. The
proxied Diameter Request maintains the same Session-Id AVP value.
5\. PCRF-1 returns a Diameter Answer as defined in clauses 4.5, 4a.5 of 3GPP
TS 29.212 [9] to the DRA (proxy).
6\. DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Answer to the Client. The proxied
Diameter Answer maintains the same Session-Id AVP value.
7\. If PA2 option is implemented, the Client uses the Origin-Host AVP value
providedin the Diameter Answer of step 6. This value is the identity of the
target PCRF. The client populates the Destination-Host AVP with this address
and sends any subsequent Diameter messages directly to this PCRF bypassing the
DRA (proxy).

V-PCRF and received by a H-DRA (proxy) in the home PLMN.
3\. The H-DRA (proxy) stores the user information (e.g. UE-NAI) and checks
whether an active DRA binding exists. If not, the H-DRA creates a dynamic DRA
binding (assignment of a PCRF node per UE or per IP-CAN session).

home PLMN. The proxied Diameter Request maintains the same Session-Id AVP
value.
5\. H-PCRF-1 returns a Diameter Answer to the H-DRA (proxy).
6\. H-DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Answer to the V-PCRF. The proxied
Diameter Answer maintains the same Session-Id AVP value.
7\. If PA2 option is implemented, the V-PCRF uses the Origin-Host AVP value
provided in the Diameter Answer of step 6. This value is the identity of the
target H-PCRF. The V-PCRF populates the Destination-Host AVP with this address
and sends any subsequent Diameter messages directly to this H-PCRF bypassing
the H-DRA

is initiated by the UE or PCRF) that requires the sending of a Diameter
Termination Request.
2\. A Diameter Termination Request (e.g., a Diameter CCR sent by PGW to
indicate termination of an IP-CAN session) as defined in clauses 4.5, 4a.5 of
3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client to the DRA (proxy). The message uses
the same Session-Id AVP value of the active Diameter session established
between the Client and PCRF-1.
3\. The DRA (proxy) verifies that there is an active DRA binding for the IP-
CAN session based on the Session-Id AVP in the request.
4\. The DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Termination Request to the target
PCRF. The proxied Diameter Request maintains the same Session-Id AVP value.

IP-CAN session and all the Diameter sessions (i.e. the Gx session or the Gxx
session) of the IP-CAN session are terminated or if the DRA binding is per UE
and all the Diameter sessions (i.e. the Gx session or the Gxx session) of that
UE are terminated the DRA (proxy) removes the DRA binding.
7\. DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Answer to the Client. The proxied
Diameter Answer maintains the same Session-Id AVP value.
NOTE: Figure 7.4.1.3.1.1 is also applicable when the AF/BBERF/PCEF in the
VPLMN terminates the Diameter sessions through the V-DRA.
NOTE: AF is not required to send Diameter session termination request to DRA

Termination Request.
2\. A Diameter Termination Request (e.g., an S9 termination request) is sent
by the V-PCRF and received by the H-DRA (proxy) in the home PLMN. The message

value.
5\. H-PCRF-1 acknowledges termination of the session. H-PCRF-1 sends a
Diameter Answer to H-DRA (proxy) in the home PLMN.
6\. The H-DRA marks the Diameter session terminated. If all the Diameter
sessions (i.e. the S9 session, the Gxx session, and the Gx session) of that UE
are terminated the H-DRA (proxy) removes the DRA binding.
7\. H-DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Answer to the V-PCRF. The proxied
Diameter Answer maintains the same Session-Id AVP value.
NOTE: V-PCRF does not need to send Rx Diameter termination messages to proxy
H-DRA (PA2 option) since Rx Diameter termination messages do not affect the
DRA binding.
### 7.4.2 Redirect DRA
#### 7.4.2.1 Establishment of Diameter Sessions
##### 7.4.2.1.1 Non-roaming cases
Establishment of Diameter sessions may occur at the following cases:
\- Gateway control session establishment
\- IP-CAN session establishment
\- AF session establishment
The DRA client (AF/BBERF/PCEF) shall follow the procedure below if an
appropriate cached route table entry created from previous DRA (redirect)
interactions does not exist. Cached route table entries are created from the
Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as
described in sections 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14 of IETF RFC 3588 [14].
Figure 7.4.2.1.1.1: Establishment of Diameter session through DRA (redirect)
1\. A Client receives an external trigger (e.g., IP-CAN session establishment
request) that requires the establishment of a Diameter session with a PCRF.

indicate establishment of an IP-CAN session as defined in clauses 4.5.1,
4a.5.1 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) with user information (e.g., UE-NAI) is sent by
the Client and received by the DRA (redirect).
3\. The DRA (redirect) stores the user information (e.g., UE-NAI) and checks
whether an active DRA binding exists. If not the DRA creates a dynamic DRA
binding (assignment of a PCRF node per UE or per IP-CAN session); if the DRA
(redirect) find there has been a DRA binding for the user, the DRA shall
select the PCRF from the binding for the client.
4\. The DRA (redirect) sends a Diameter Answer indicating redirection as
defined in IETF RFC 3588 [14]. The target PCRF identity is included in the
Redirect-Host AVP.
5\. The Client re-sends the Diameter Establishment Request of step 2 to the
target PCRF.
6\. PCRF-1 returns a Diameter Answer, as defined in clauses 4.5, 4a.5 of 3GPP
TS 29.212 [12], to the Client.

Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as
described in section 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14 of IETF RFC 3588 [14].
Figure 7.4.2.1.2.1: Establishment of Diameter session through DRA (redirect)
-- Roaming scenario
1\. The V-PCRF receives an external trigger (e.g., IP-CAN session
establishment request) that requires the establishment of a Diameter session
with an H-PCRF over the S9 reference point.
2\. A Rx/S9 Diameter Establishment Request with user information (e.g., UE-
NAI) is sent by the V-PCRF and received by the H-DRA (redirect) in the home
PLMN.
3\. The H-DRA (redirect) stores the user information (e.g., UE-NAI) and checks
whether an active DRA binding exists. If not the H-DRA creates a dynamic DRA
binding (assignment of a PCRF node per UE); if the DRA (redirect) find there
has been a DRA binding for the user, the DRA shall select the PCRF from the
binding for the client.
4\. The H-DRA (redirect) sends a Diameter Answer indicating redirection as
defined in IETF RFC 3588 [14]. The target PCRF identity is included in the
Redirect-Host AVP.
5\. The V-PCRF re-sends the Rx/S9 Diameter Establishment Request of step 2 to
the target H-PCRF.
6\. H-PCRF-1 returns a corresponding Diameter Answer to the V-PCRF.
NOTE: The V-PCRF may proxy the Rx Diameter Establishment Request to the H-PCRF
directly (e.g. based on the stored information provided by H-DRA during the S9
Diameter session establishment).
#### 7.4.2.2 Modification of Diameter sessions
The PCEF shall send the Diameter session modification message to the DRA to
update the DRA binding information only if the UE's address(es) is updated and
the DRA (redirect) is maintaining PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session.
For visited access case, the V-PCRF shall send the Diameter session
modification message to the H-DRA to update the DRA binding information only
if the UE's address(es) is updated. The detailed procedure is similar to the
Establishment of Diameter sessions, which is described in the clause 7.4.2.1.
#### 7.4.2.3 Termination of Diameter Sessions
##### 7.4.2.3.1 Non-roaming cases
Termination of Diameter sessions that impact the DRA binding occur at the
following cases:
\- Gateway control session termination
\- IP-CAN session termination
The DRA client (BBERF/PCEF) shall follow the procedure below if the DRA
(redirect) is maintaining PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session or an
appropriate cached route table entry created from previous DRA (redirect)
interactions does not exist. Cached route table entries are created from the
Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as
described in section 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14 of IETF RFC 3588 [14].
Figure 7.4.2.3.1.1: Termination of Diameter sessions through DRA (redirect)
1\. Client receives an external trigger (e.g. an IP-CAN session termination is
initiated by the UE or PCRF) that triggers the client to terminate Diameter
session with server (i.e. PCRF)
2 A Diameter Termination Request (e.g., as defined in clauses 4.5.7 (Gx) and
4a.5.3 (Gxx) of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client to the DRA
(redirect).
3\. A Diameter Termination Request (e.g., as defined in clauses 4.5.7 (Gx) and
4a.5.3 (Gxx) of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client to PRCF-1. The
message uses the same Session-Id AVP value of the active Diameter session
established between the Client and PCRF-1.
NOTE: Steps 2, 3 may be carried out in parallel. Otherwise, the client after
step2 may need to wait for the redirect answer before sending the Diameter
termination request to the PCRF.
4\. DRA (redirect) verifies that there is an active DRA binding for the IP-CAN
session based on the Session-Id AVP and marks the Diameter session terminated.
If the DRA binding is per IP-CAN session and all the Diameter sessions (i.e.
Gx session or Gxx session) of that IP-CAN session are terminated or if the DRA
binding is per UE and all the Diameter sessions (i.e. Gx session or Gxx
session) of that UE are terminated the DRA removes the DRA binding.
5 DRA (redirect) acknowledges termination of the session by sending a Diameter
redirect answer to the client.
6 PCRF-1 acknowledges termination of session. PCRF-1 sends a Diameter Answer
(e.g., as defined in clauses 4.5.7 (Gx) and 4a.5.3 (Gxx) of 3GPP TS 29.212
[9]) to the Client.
NOTE: Figure 7.4.2.3.1.1 is also applicable when the BBERF/PCEF in the VPLMN
terminates the Diameter sessions through the V-DRA.
##### 7.4.2.3.2 Roaming cases
Termination of Diameter sessions occur at the following cases:
> \- S9 session termination
The DRA client (AF/BBERF/PCEF) shall follow the procedure below) if the DRA
(redirect) is maintaining PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session or an
appropriate cached route table entry created from previous DRA (redirect)
interactions does not exist. Cached route table entries are created from the
Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as
described in section 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14 of IETF RFC 3588 [14].
Figure 7.4.2.3.2.1: Termination of Diameter sessions through DRA (redirect) --
Roaming case
1\. V-PCRF receives an external trigger (e.g. session termination request from
the BBERF, PCEF) that requires the sending of a Diameter Termination Reqeust.
2 A Diameter Termination Request is sent by the V-PCRF and received by the
H-DRA (redirect) in the home PLMN.
3\. A Diameter Termination Request is sent by the V-PCRF to H-PRCF-1. The
message uses the same Session-Id AVP value of the active Diameter session
established between theV-PCRF and H-PCRF-1.
NOTE: Steps 2, 3 may be carried out in parallel. Otherwise, the V-PCRF after
step2 may need to wait for the redirect answer before sending the Diameter
termination request to the H-PCRF
4\. H-DRA (redirect) verifies that there is an active DRA binding for the IP-
CAN session based on the Session-Id AVP and marks the Diameter session
terminated. If all the Diameter sessions (i.e. S9 session, Gxx session, Gx
session) of that UE are terminated the H-DRA removes the DRA binding.
5 H-DRA (redirect) acknowledges termination of the session by sending a
Diameter redirect answer to the V-PCRF.
6 H-PCRF-1 acknowledges termination of the session by sending a Diameter
answer to the V-PCRF.
NOTE: Rx Diameter termination messages are not required to be sent to H-DRA
(redirect) since such messages do not affect the DRA binding

Figure B.2.2.1: PCC Procedures for IMS Session Establishment at terminating
P-CSCF and PCRF
Optionally, the provisioning of service information may be derived already
from the SDP offer to enable that a possible rejection of the service
information by the PCRF is obtained by the P-CSCF in time to reject the

respectively).
Figure B.3.1.1: Provisioning of service information at IMS session
modification
Optionally, the provisioning of service information may be derived already
from the SDP offer to enable that a possible rejection of the service
information by the PCRF is obtained by the P-CSCF in time to reject the

Figure B.3.1.2: Provisioning of service information derived from SDP offer and
answer at IMS session modification
## B.3.2 Enabling of IP Flows
The PCRF makes a final decision to enable the allocated QoS resource for the
authorized IP flows of the media component (s) if the QoS resources are not
enabled at the time they are authorized by the PCRF or if the media IP flow(s)
previously placed on hold are resumed, i.e. the media IP flow(s) of the media
component that was placed on hold at the time of the resource authorization or
at a later stage is reactivated (with SDP direction sendrecv, sendonly,
recvonly or none direction).
The Enabling of IP Flows procedure is triggered by the P-CSCF receiving any
2xx success response to an INVITE request or a 2xx success response to an
UPDATE request within a confirmed dialogue that is not embedded as part of
another INVITE Transaction (in both cases a 200 OK response is usually
received). When receiving such responses, the PCRF shall take the SDP
direction attribute in the latest received SDP (either within the 2xx success
or a previous SIP message) into account when deciding, which gates shall be
opened:
\- For a unidirectional SDP media component, IP flows in the opposite
direction shall not be enabled.
\- For an inactive SDP media component, no IP flows shall be enabled.
Figure B.3.2.1 is applicable to the Mobile Originating (MO) side and the
Mobile Terminating (MT) side.
1\. The P-CSCF receives the 2xx Success message complying with the conditions
specified in the paragraphs above.
2\. The P-CSCF sends a Diameter AAR message to the PCRF, requesting that gates
shall be opened.
3\. The PCRF approves the enabling of IP flows and PCRF updates flow status of
affected PCC rules.
4 The PCRF sends a Diameter AAA to the P-CSCF.
5 The P-CSCF forwards the 2xx Success message.
6\. The PCRF executes interactions according to figure 4.3.1.1.1. This step
implies opening the 'gates' by updating the flow status of PCC rules.
Figure B.3.2.1: Enabling of IP Flows
## B.3.3 Disabling of IP Flows
The \"Disabling of IP Flows\" procedure is used when media IP flow(s) of a
session are put on hold (e.g. in case of a media re-negotiation or call hold).
Media is placed on hold as specified in RFC 3264 [11]. Media modified to
become inactive (SDP direction attribute) shall also be considered to be put
on hold.
If a bidirectional media component is placed on hold by making it
unidirectional, the IP flows shall only be disabled in the deactivated
direction. If a media component is placed on hold by making it inactive, the
IP flows shall be disabled in both directions.
Figure B.3.3.1 presents the \"Disabling of IP Flows\" procedure at media on
hold for both the Mobile Originating (MO) side and the Mobile Terminating (MT)
side.
1\. The P-CSCF receives an SDP answer putting media on hold within a SIP
message. (NOTE 1)
2\. The P-CSCF sends a Diameter AAR request to the PCRF, requesting that gates
shall be closed.
3\. The PCRF updates flow status of affected PCC rules for the media on hold.
4\. The PCRF sends a Diameter AAA message back to the P-CSCF.
5\. The P-CSCF forwards the SDP answer putting media on hold within a SIP
message.
6\. The PCRF executes interactions according to figure 4.3.1.1.1. This step
implies closing the relevant media IP flow gate(s), leaving the possible
related RTCP gate(s) open to keep the connection alive.
NOTE: This procedure occurs whenever a bidirectional media is made
unidirectional or when a media is changed to inactive.

## B.3.4 Media Component Removal
Figure B.3.4.1 presents the flows of PCC procedures at the removal of media
component(s) from an IMS session which is not being released for both the
Mobile Originating (MO) side and the Mobile Terminating (MT) side.
1\. A SIP message containing SDP indicating the removal of media component(s)
is received by the P-CSCF.
2\. The P-CSCF sends Diameter AAR to the PCRF with modified service
information.
3\. The PCRF stores the Session information and identifies the affected IP-CAN
Session(s).
4\. The PCRF sends a Diameter AAA message back to the P-CSCF.
5\. The P-CSCF forwards the SDP answer removing a media component.
6\. The PCRF makes a decision on what PCC/QoS rules need to be modified or
removed and executes interactions according to figure 4.3.1.1.1.

# B.4 IMS Session Termination
### B.4.1 Mobile initiated session release / Network initiated session release
Figure B.4.1.1 presents the mobile or network initiated IMS session release
for both the Mobile Originating (MO) side and the Mobile Terminating (MT)
side. The session release may be signalled by a SIP BYE message, or any SIP
3xx redirect response, or any 4xx, 5xx, or 6xx SIP final error response to an
initial INVITE request. If any 4xx, 5xx, or 6xx SIP final error response to
Re-INVITE or UPDATE request just terminates the transaction, then the session
is not released, otherwise if the error response terminates the dialog then
the session is released.
1\. SIP BYE message, a SIP 3xx redirect response, or any 4xx, 5xx, or 6xx SIP
final error response to an initial INVITE or any 4xx, 5xx, or 6xx SIP final
error response to Re-INVITE or UPDATE which terminates the dialog is received
by the P-CSCF.
2\. P-CSCF forwards the BYE message, or the SIP 3xx redirect response, or any
4xx, 5xx, or 6xx SIP final error response.
3\. The Interactions in Figure 4.3.1.1.1 are applicable.

### B.4.2 IP-CAN Bearer Release/Loss
An IP-CAN Bearer Release or Loss event may affect all IP-Flows within an IMS
Session. Flows in clause 4.3.2.2.1 (AF located in the HPLMN) or 4.3.2.2.2 (AF
located in the VPLMN) apply for case 1. Flows in clause 4.4.2.1.1 (Home Routed
case) or 4.4.2.2.1 (Visited Access case) apply for case 2a and case 2b.
###### ## Annex C (normative): NAT Related Procedures
# C.1 Support for media traversal of NATs using ICE
The IMS calls out procedures for NAT traversal for media and signaling within
IMS. One of the methods supported by IMS for media traversal of NATs is a UE
controlled NAT traversal solution based on the IETF Interactive Connectivity
Establishment (ICE) protocol, IETF RFC 5245 [15]. When a UE uses the ICE
protocol for media traversal of NATs, additional enhancements to the existing
PCC procedures are necessary to allow for proper ICE operation.
This annex presents a set of rules that PCC network elements use to build flow
descriptors, identify the proper UE IP addresses used by the PCRF for session
and bearer binding, and gating control when the ICE procedures are invoked by
the UE.
In order for the ICE procedures to work a static, preconfigured PCC rule needs
to be in place at the PCEF which allows the UE to perform STUN binding
requests prior to offering or answering an SDP.
NOTE 1: Predefined PCC rules can be created to allow the UE to communicate
with the STUN relay much in the same way the UE is allowed to communicate with
the IMS network for session management.
NOTE 2: Given that a STUN relay is a forwarding server under the direction of
the UE, necessary precaution needs to be taken by the operator in how it
chooses to craft these rules. It is recommended that such predefined rules
only guarantee the minimal amount of bandwidth necessary to accomplish the
necessary UE to STUN relay communication. Such an approach helps reduce the
resources required to support NAT traversal mechanisms. Finally, such an
approach allows the preconfigured rule to be over-ridden by dynamic rules
which allow for the necessary bandwidth needed by the session.
NOTE 3: The dynamic PCC rule will need to differentiate between different
media traffic between UE and STUN relay (e.g. voice vs. video), which can be
identified by the different ports assigned by the residential NAT. Session
bindings need to take into account that the relevant terminal IP address may
be contained within the ICE candidates contained in the session description,
rather than in the normal media description.
NOTE 4: It is assumed that the NAT device is located between the UE and the
PCEF. NAT traversal outside of IMS in FBI services is considered FFS in the
current 3GPP stage 2 specifications.
NOTE 5: When a NAT device is located between the UE and the PCEF, it is
assumed that the IP CAN session signalling will contain the IP address
assigned by the residential NAT, rather than the UE IP address.
NOTE 6: It is assumed that NAT devices that assign multiple IP addresses for
the UE are outside the scope of release 7.
NOTE 7: In this release, only one IP address per subscription is supported by
session binding at the PCRF. Multiple UEs behind a NAT will use the same IP
CAN session and IP address.
# C.2 P-CSCF procedures
## C.2.1 General
The procedures in clause C.2 are only invoked in the case where the local UE
(uplink SDP) has utilized the ICE protocol for media traversal of NATs. The
P-CSCF can determine this by inspecting the UE provided SDP (uplink) for the
\"a=candidate\" attribute(s). If such attributes are present this is an
indication that the UE has invoked the ICE procedures as defined in IETF RFC
5245 [15] for media traversal of NATs and the P-CSCF shall follow the
requirements in clause C.2.
## C.2.2 Deriving the UEs IP address
The P-CSCF shall set the Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP to
the source IP address of SIP messages received from the UE.
## C.2.3 Deriving flow descriptions
In the case where STUN Relay and ICE are used for NAT traversal, the UE is
required to place the STUN Relay provided address in the \"m=\" and \"c=\"
lines of its SDP. Given that these addresses cannot be used by the P-CSCF for
building a valid flow description, the P-CSCF will need to determine if a STUN
Relay address has been provided in the \"m=\" and \"c=\" lines of the UE
provided SDP (uplink only). The P-CSCF shall make this determination by
inspecting the uplink SDP for \"a=candidate\" attributes and compare the
candidate address with that contained in the \"c=\" line. If a match is found,
the P-CSCF shall then look at the candidate type. If the candidate type is
\"relay\" then the address in the \"c=\" line is that of a STUN Relay server.
In this case, the P-CSCF shall derive the Flow-Description AVP within the
service information from the SDP candidate type of \"relay\" as follows:
**Uplink Flow-Description**
\- Destination Address and Port: If the P-CSCF knows the destination address
and port of the STUN Relay allocation that the UE is sending media to, it
should use that information. If the P-CSCF does not know this address and
port, it shall wildcard the uplink destination address and port.
\- Source Address and Port: The P-CSCF shall populate the uplink source
address with the \"rel-addr\" address and the uplink source port with the
\"rel-port\" port contained within the \"a=candidate\" attribute.
**Downlink Flow-Description**
\- Destination Address and Port: The P-CSCF shall populate the downlink
destination address with the \"rel-addr\" address and the downlink destination
port with the \"rel-port\" port contained within the \"a=candidate\"
attribute.
\- Source Address and Port: If the P-CSCF knows the source address and port of
the STUN Relay allocation that the UE is receiving media from, it should use
that information. If the P-CSCF does not know this address and port, it shall
wildcard the downlink source address and port.
For the other candidate types, the address in the \"c=\" and \"m=\" SDP
attributes can be used for building the flow descriptor and the P-CSCF shall
follow the rules to derive the Flow-Description AVP as described in table
6.2.2 of clause 6.2 of this TS.
## C.2.4 Gating control
If both endpoints have indicated support for ICE (both the SDP offer and
answer contain SDP attributes of type \"a=candidate\") ICE connectivity checks
will take place between the two UEs. In order to allow these checks to pass
through the PCEF, the P-CSCF shall enable each flow description for each media
component upon receipt of the SDP answer.
## C.2.5 Bandwidth impacts
ICE has been designed such that connectivity checks are paced inline with RTP
data (sent no faster than 20ms) and thus consumes a lesser or equal amount of
bandwidth compared to the media itself (given the small packet size of a STUN
connectivity check it is expected that the STUN connectivity checks will
always have a smaller payload than the media stream itself). Thus, there are
no additional requirements on the P-CSCF for bandwidth calculations for a
given media flow.
# C.3 PCRF procedures
## C.3.1 General
The procedures in clause C.3 are only invoked when the following two
conditions are met:
1\. Both the local and remote UE have utilized the ICE protocol for media
traversal of NATs (see subclause C.2.1 for details on how this is determined);
and
2\. The IP-CAN which is servicing the IMS session does not support the concept
of a default bearer.
## C.3.2 Deriving additional flow descriptions
The PCRF may need to develop additional flow descriptions (beyond those
provided by the P-CSCF) for a media component based on additional candidate
addresses present in the SDP offer/answer exchange. The PCRF shall follow the
procedures defined in IETF RFC 5245 [15] for forming candidate pairs based on
the data contained within the received codec-data AVP. For each candidate pair
created based on the ICE procedures and not already present in the received
flow descriptions, the PCRF shall add an uplink and downlink flow description
for each media component.
NOTE 1: The uplink SDP represents the local candidates while the downlink SDP
represents the remote candidates.
Following the ICE procedures for forming candidate pairs will result in some
flow descriptions which would never be exercised. In particular, while the UE
will send connectivity checks (and ultimately its media stream) from its host
candidate, from the PCEF perspective, this will appear as being from the
server reflexive address. Given this, the PCRF should not form flow
descrptions using host candidate addresses and should only form additional
flows based on server reflexive addresses and relay addresses.
As candidates are removed from the SDP via subsequent offer/answer exchanges,
the PCRF shall update its candidate pair list and shall remove any flow
descriptors no longer being used.
NOTE 2: If the default candidate (the candidate used to populate the \"c=\"
and \"m=\" lines of both the uplink and downlink SDP) is chosen, then an
updated SDP offer/answer will not be done, and any extra flow descriptions not
being used by the session will not be removed.
## C.3.3 Gating control
For each additional flow description the PCRF adds to a media component (per
sub-clause C.3.2), the PCRF shall enable the flow in order to allow
connectivity checks to pass.
## C.3.4 Bandwidth impacts
Per clause C.2.5 ICE is designed to have minimal impact on bandwidth policy
control. However, it is possible that media will begin flowing while the ICE
connectivity checks are still in progress. Given the possibility that no
session update will be made (the default candidates will be chosen by the ICE
protocol), it is not recommended that the PCRF adjust the bandwidth parameters
provided by the P-CSCF.
###### ## Annex D (normative): Access specific procedures for GPRS
# D.1 General
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for General Packet
Radio Service (GPRS).
# D.2 Binding Mechanisms
Depending on the bearer control mode, bearer binding can be executed either by
PCRF, PCEF or both PCRF and PCEF.
\- For \"UE-only\" IP-CAN bearer establishment mode, the PCRF performs bearer
binding.
\- For \"UE/NW\" IP-CAN bearer establishment mode, the PCRF performs the
binding of the PCC rules for user controlled services while the PCEF performs
the binding of the PCC rules for the network controlled services.
If the PCEF performs the bearer binding, the PCRF shall follow the procedures
as described in subclause 5.4 with the exceptions described in this subclause.
If the Bearer Binding function is located at the PCEF, the PCEF shall check
the QCI indicated by the PCC Rule(s) and bind the PCC rule with an IP-CAN
bearer that has the same QCI.
If there is no suitable PDP-Context to accommodate a PCC rule when PCEF
performs the bearer binding, the PCEF shall initiate the establishment of PDP-
Contexts as specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3].
If the Bearer Binding function is located at the PCRF, the PCRF shall compare
the TFT(s) of all IP-CAN bearer(s) within the IP-CAN session received via PCEF
from the UE with the existing service data flow filter information. The PCRF
shall indicate to the PCEF the IP-CAN bearer within the IP-CAN session where
the PCC Rules shall be installed, modified or removed. This is done including
the Bearer-Identifier AVP together with the associated PCC Rules within the
corresponding RAR and/or CCA commands.
\- When the PCRF does not require additional filter information coming from
the UE in order to decide on bearer binding, the PCRF shall supply the PCC
rules to be installed over the Gx interface to the PCEF within a RAR command.
\- Otherwise, the PCRF shall wait for the PCEF requesting a policy decision
for the establishment of a new IP-CAN bearer or the modification of an
existing one within a CCR command over the Gx interface.
\- When the PCEF reports the bearer event, it shall include within the CCR
command a bearer reference together with the new or modified TFT information,
the QCI and associated bitrates for new or modified PDP-Contexts.
# D.3 PCC Procedures
## D.3.1 IP-CAN Session Modification
### D.3.1.1 Network-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
Network-initiated IP-CAN session modification is executed according to clause
4.3.1.1 with the following differences:
\- The timer in step 4 will also be activated waiting for one of the following
cases:
\- If the authorized QoS for an IP-CAN bearer is changed or
\- If one or more Flow Descriptions need to be added, deactivated or removed
in any of the PCC rules bound to an IP-CAN bearer
\- If the timer in step 4 expires and the PCRF still requires additional
filter information coming from the UE in order to decide on bearer binding for
new PCC rules to be installed, all subsequent steps in figure 4.3.1.1.1 shall
not be executed, and further reactions of the PCRF are left unspecified. As a
possible option, the PCRF could abort the AF session.
\- When the PCRF performs the bearer binding, once the PCC rules are selected,
the PCRF identifies the IP-CAN bearer for each of the PCC rules and the
authorized QoS. The PCRF may provision PCC Rules and authorized QoS for
several IP-CAN Bearers within the same RAR command.
\- For step 9, IP-CAN session signalling, the subsequent steps are executed
separately for each IP-CAN bearer under the following conditions:
\- if all PCC rules bound to a PDP context have been removed or deactivated
(PDP Context deactivation is applicable)
\- if one or more PDP contexts have to be modified
\- if in UE/NW Bearer Control Mode, the GGSN needs to establish a new PDP
context(PDP Context establishment is applicable) if the bearer binding is
located at the PCEF.
The GGSN initiates the procedure to Create/Update or Terminate PDP Context
Request message to the SGSN. If in the case of updating the PDP Context the
authorized QoS for the bearer has changed, the GGSN will modify the UMTS QoS
parameters accordingly.
When the procedure in step 9 is completed and requires notifications from the
GW, for an IP-CAN Bearer termination in UE-Only Bearer Control Mode, the GGSN
sends a Diameter CCR with the Bearer-Identifier and Bearer-Operation AVPs to
indicate \"Termination\".
### D.3.1.2 PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure shall take place
according to clauses 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2 except for those procedures initiated
by the UE, as described in the clauses below.
#### D.3.1.2.1 UE-initiated IP-CAN Bearer Establishment or IP-CAN Bearer
Modification
This clause is applicable for the establishment of a new IP-CAN Bearer (other
than the one which created the IP-CAN session) and for the modification of an
already established IP-CAN Bearer. The signalling flows for these cases are as
per Figure 4.3.1.2.1.
A bearer-event-initiated Request of PCC Rules occurs when a new bearer is
established or when an existing bearer is modified. For GPRS, these are PDP
Context Modification(s) or secondary PDP context Activation(s). An IP-CAN
Session modification triggers a PCC Rule request only if the PCRF has
previously requested a PCC Rule request for the given modification event.
Figure D.3.1.2.1: UE-initiated IP-CAN Bearer Establishment and Modification.
1\. The GW receives IP-CAN Bearer signalling that is a trigger for a PCC Rule
request. For GPRS, the GGSN receives a secondary Establish PDP Context Request
or an Update PDP Context Request.
2\. The GW informs the PCRF of the modification of the IP-CAN Session due to
the IP-CAN Bearer signalling in step 1, using a Diameter CCR with the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST. The GW reuses the existing
Gx DCC session corresponding to the IP-CAN Session.
> If the IP-CAN Bearer signalling in step 1 established a new IP-CAN Bearer,
> the GW assigns a new bearer identifier to this IP-CAN Bearer. The GW
> provides information about the new or modified bearer, e.g. requested QoS
> and TFT filters. If the event that caused the bearer modification applies
> uniquely to that bearer and PCRF performs the bearer binding, then, the
> bearer identifier should be provided within the CCR. If no bearer identifier
> is provided, the event trigger will apply to the IP-CAN session.
3\. The PCRF stores the received information in the Diameter CCR.
4\. The PCRF binds the IP-CAN Session to existing of AF session(s) using the
information received from the GW and the Service Information included in the
stored PCC rules, which was previously received from the AF(s) , as depicted
in figure 4.3.1.1.1.\ The PCRF also binds the IP-CAN Bearers within the IP-CAN
Session to all matching IP flow(s) of existing AF session(s) using the bearer
information received from the GW and the Service Information received from the
AF(s). If IP flow(s), which have previously been bound to other bearers, have
been bound to the modified bearer, PCC Rules in other bearer(s) may need to be
removed. For GPRS, an IP flow may need to be removed if a matching higher
priority TFT filter in the newly established PDP context takes precedence over
a matching lower priority TFT filter in another PDP context. Furthermore, if
IP Flow(s), which have previously been bound to the modified bearer are be
bound to other bearer(s), PCC Rules may need to be installed in other bearers.
For GPRS, an IP flow may be bound to another PDP context if it was previously
bound to the modified PDP context due to a removed higher priority TFT filter,
and a lower priority TFT filter in the other PDP context matches the IP flow.
5\. If the PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have
it, the PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.
6\. The SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the
information about the allowed service(s) and PCC Rules information.
NOTE: For steps 5 and 6: The details associated with the Sp reference point
are not specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber
databases is not specified in this Release.
7\. For IP CAN session modification, if the AF requested a notification of the
corresponding event at the initial authorisation of the AF session, the PCRF
shall sent a Diameter RAR with the Specific-Action AVP set to indicate the
trigger event that caused the request.
8\. If step 7 happens, the AF replies with a Diameter RAA and may provide
updated service information within.
9\. The PCRF selects the new PCC Rule(s) to be installed. The PCRF can also
identify existing PCC Rules that need to be modified or removed. The PCC Rules
may relate to any of the matching AF sessions identified in step 4 or may
exist in the PCRF without matching to any AF session. The PCRF may also make a
policy decision by defining an authorized QoS and by deciding whether service
flows described in the PCC Rules are to be enabled or disabled.\ For types of
IP-CAN, where the PCRF controls IP-CAN Bearers, e.g. GPRS, the PCC Rules may
affect the IP-CAN Bearer identified in the CCR of step 2 or any other IP-CAN
Bearer identified in step 4.
10\. The PCRF stores the modified PCC Rules.
11\. The PCC Rules are provisioned by the PCRF to the GW using Diameter CCA.
The PCRF may also provide authorized QoS. The PCRF identifies the affected IP-
CAN Bearer for each of the PCC Rules and the authorized QoS. The PCRF may
provision PCC Rules and authorized QoS for several IP-CAN Bearers within the
same CCA.
12\. The GW installs the received PCC Rules. The GW also enforces the
authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow according to the flow
status of the corresponding PCC Rules.
13\. The GW sends a response to the IP-CAN Bearer signalling in step 1.\ For
GPRS, the GGSN accepts the secondary Establish PDP Context Request or the
Update PDP Context Request based on the results of the authorisation policy
decision enforcement and sends an Establish PDP Context Response or Update PDP
Context Response. If the requested QoS parameters do not correspond to the
authorized QoS, the GGSN adjusts (downgrades/upgrades) the requested UMTS QoS
parameters to the authorized values.
The PCRF may have decided in step 4 to modify PCC Rules and/or authorized QoS
of other IP CAN bearers than the IP-CAN Bearer identified in the CCR of step
2. For each such other IP-CAN Bearer identified in step 4, the GGSN executes
the following steps.
14\. The PCRF may start a timer to wait for PDP context modification requests
from the UE.
15\. The PCRF interacts with the GW according to figure 4.3.1.1.1.
#### D.3.1.2.2 UE-initiated IP-CAN Bearer Termination
This clause is applicable if an IP-CAN Bearer is being released while other
IP-CAN Bearers and thus the IP-CAN Session are not released.
For the termination of IP-CAN Bearers, three cases are covered:
\- Bearer release that does not cause service data flow(s) within an AF
session to be disabled;
\- Bearer release that causes at least one but not all the service data
flow(s) within an AF session to be disabled; and
\- Bearer release that causes all the service data flows within an AF session
to be disabled.
A Bearer release may not cause a service data flow within this bearer to be
disabled if the IP flow can be bound to another bearer. For GPRS, an IP flow
can be bound to another PDP context if a lower precedence TFT filter matching
the IP flow is installed at the other PDP context.
Figure D.3.1.2.2: UE-Initiated IP-CAN Bearer Termination
1\. The GW receives a Remove IP-CAN Bearer Request that request the
deactivation of an IP-CAN Bearer while other IP-CAN Bearers and thus the IP-
CAN Session are not released. The form of the Remove IP-CAN Bearer Request
depends upon the type of the IP-CAN. For GPRS, the GGSN receives a Delete PDP
Context Request.
2\. The GW sends a Diameter CCR message with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to
the value UPDATE_REQUEST to the PCRF, indicating the IP-CAN Bearer
termination.
3\. The PCRF identifies the IP flows bound to the removed bearer and updates
the stored bearer information. The PCRF re-evaluates the binding of IP flows,
as IP flows may now be bound to other bearers. For GPRS, an IP flow may be
bound to another PDP Context if it was previously bound to the removed PDP
context due to a higher priority TFT filter, and a lower priority TFT filter
in another PDP context matches the IP flow.
> The following steps 4 and 5 are performed for each of the other bearers
> identified in step 3:
4\. The PCRF selects the PCC Rule(s) to be installed or modified for the
affected bearer. The PCRF may also update the policy decision for this bearer.
5\. The PCRF stores the updated PCC Rules for the affected bearer.
6\. The PCRF acknowledges the bearer termination by sending a Diameter CCA
message.\ The PCRF provides PCC Rules and possibly updated authorized QoS for
each of the other bearers identified in step 3. The PCRF identifies the
affected IP-CAN Bearer for each of the PCC Rules and the authorized QoS.
7\. The GW removes those PCC Rules, which have not been moved to other IP CAN
bearers by the CCA message and are installed in the IP-CAN bearer, for which a
termination has been requested in step 1.
8\. The GW sends a Remove IP-CAN Bearer Response. For GPRS, the GGSN sends the
Delete PDP Context Response message.
9\. It the PCRF has provided PCC Rules and possibly updated authorized QoS for
other bearers in step 6, the GW installs or modifies the identified PCC Rules.
The GW also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow
according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules.
The following steps 10 to 13 or 10a to 13a apply for the case where at least
one IP Flow within an AF session is being disabled, i.e. if the IP Flow is not
bound to any other bearer that is still established. The steps shall be
performed separately for each ongoing AF session that is affected by the
bearer release as explained below.
If all IP flow(s) within the AF session are disabled by the bearer release:
10\. The PCRF indicates the session abort to the AF by sending a Diameter ASR
message to the AF.
11\. The AF responds by sending a Diameter ASA message to the PCRF.
12\. The AF sends a Diameter STR message to the PCRF to indicate that the
session has been terminated.
13\. The PCRF responds by sending a Diameter STA message to the AF.
If at least one but not all of the IP flow(s) within the AF session are
disabled by the bearer release, and the AF has requested notification of
bearer removal:
10a. The PCRF indicates the release of the bearer by sending a Diameter RAR to
the AF.
11a. The AF responds by sending a Diameter RAA to the PCRF.
12a. The AF may send an AAR to the PCRF to update the session information.
13a. If step 12a occurs, the PCRF responds by sending a AAA to the AF.
