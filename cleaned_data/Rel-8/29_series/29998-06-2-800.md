# 1 Scope
The present document investigates how the OSA Mobility Interface Class methods
defined in 3GPP TS 29.198-6 [5] can be mapped onto IMS ISC Interface (SIP)
operations.\ The mapping of the OSA API to the SIP is considered informative,
and not normative. An overview of the mapping TR is contained in the
introduction of the present document as well as in 3GPP TR 29.998-1 [10].
The OSA specifications define an architecture that enables application
developers to make use of network functionality through an open standardised
interface, i.e. the OSA API\'s. The API specification is contained in the 3GPP
TS 29.198 series of specifications. An overview of these is available in the
introduction of the present document as well as in 3GPP TS 29.198-1 [1]. The
concepts and the functional architecture for the Open Service Access (OSA) are
described by 3GPP TS 23.198 [3]. The requirements for OSA are defined in 3GPP
TS 22.127 [2].

# 4 User Status Service SIP Flows
The User Status (US) interface class allows applications to obtain the status
of mobile telephony users.
## 4.1 triggeredStatusReportingStartReq
**_TriggeredStatusReportingStartReq_** is a method that request for triggered
status reports when one or several users\' is registrered/re-registrerd from
the IMS core network. The user status service will only send a report when the
status changes (registred to de-registred and vice-versa).

## 4.2 triggeredStatusReportingStop
**_triggeredStatusReportingStop_** is a method that is used by the application
to disable triggered user status notifications.
Figure 4-2: Call Flow for triggeredStatusReportingStop
Table 4-3: Normal Operation
* * *
Pre-condition The application has invoked _triggeredStatusReportingReq(_) 1
The application invokes the **_triggeredStatusReportingStop()_** method for
one, several or all users within an assignment (i.e. requested with the
corresponding **_triggeredStatusReportingStartReq()_)** 2 The trigger setting
on the appropriate subscriber status is disabled.

## 4.3 statusReportReq
**_statusReportReq_** is a method that is used by the application to request a
user status report (registered/unregistred in IMS core network). Note that
this can be requested for multiple users at the same time.
Figure 4-3: Call Flow for statusReportReq
Table 4-5: Normal Operation
* * *
**Pre-conditions**  
1 The application invokes the **statusReportReq()** method 2 The SCS checks
the subscriber status and the current status is returned to the application
via **statusReportRes()**. See section Â§4.4.

## 4.4 statusReportRes
**_statusReportRes_** delivers a report indicating if a user has been
registred or unregistred. Note that this can be requested for multiple users
at the same time.
Figure 4-4: Call Flow for statusReportRes
Table 4-7: Normal Operation
* * *
Pre-condition The application has invoked a _statusReportReq_
1 The OSA SCS has collected subscriber status based on REGISTER notifications
received/or not received from the network.\ Note that several contact
addresses can be registered for a subscriber Address-of-Record.
2 The current subscriber status is returned to the application using
**statusReportRes()**. A subscriber is reachable if at least one valid SIP or
TEL contact address is registered.

## 4.5 triggeredStatusReport
**_triggeredStatusReport_** is a method that is used to notify the application
of the the change of the subscriber(s) status from Registred to Unregistred
and vice-versa.
Figure 4-5: Call Flow for triggeredStatusReport, triggered by SIP REGISTER
Table 4-9: Normal Operation
* * *
Pre-conditions Status repoting has been enabled by
triggerStatusReportingStartReq 1 A third party **_REGISTER_** arrives from IMS
core network. This request is detected by the SIP Server which determines if
an overall status change has occurred for the subscriber 2 If the subscriber
status has changed the OSA SCS identifies the application that requested these
users status changes (from registred to un-registered and vice-versa) and
invokes the **_triggeredStatusReport_** method appropriately.
