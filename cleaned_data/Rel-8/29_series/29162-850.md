# 4 General
## 4.1 General interworking overview
The IM CN Subsystem interworks with SIP IETF RFC 3261 [2] based IP Multimedia
networks. These IP Multimedia networks include:
\- SIP User Agents (UAs);
\- SIP Servers.
As such, the IM CN Subsystem has to be able to interwork to all of these above
functional entities in the IP multimedia network, as there is a possibility
that they all may be involved in an IM session. The general interworking model
is shown in figure 1. The SIP based Multimedia networks may use IP version 4
IETF RFC 791 [9] or IP version 6 IETF RFC 2460 [10].
Figure 1: Interworking Model for IM CN Subsystem to IP Multimedia Network
The UE uses the CSCF in order to communicate with the external IP multimedia
network entities.
If no IP version interworking or no NAT/NAPT between different realms is
required, the CSCF can communicate with SIP UAs in an external IP multimedia
network directly.
If no IP version interworking or no NAT/NAPT between different realms is
required, the CSCF can also communicate with SIP proxies in an external IP
multimedia network directly, which in turn can then communicate with SIP UAs.
To provide the IP version interworking or NAT/NAPT between different realms
the functions of an IMS-ALG and a TrGW may be inserted between the CSCF and
external IP Multimedia Network by configuration. The IMS-ALG and the TrGW may
be implemented as a part of other physical entities in the IMS.
NOTE: Other methods to provide IP version interworking are for further study.
## 4.2 Interworking scenarios
3GPP specifications design the IM CN subsystem elements and interfaces to
exclusively support IPv6. 3GPP TS 23.221 [3] details the interoperability
scenarios that an UE may experience when interworking with an external PDN.
All of these IP transport layer interworking scenarios can apply to the
application layer interworking scenarios detailed in clause 4.2.1.
### 4.2.1 UE with 3GPP SIP profile capability connecting to an external SIP
device
The procedures used by an UE with 3GPP SIP profile to connect to an external
SIP device, which may lack 3GPP SIP profile capabilities, have been analysed
in Release 6 within 3GPP TR 29.962 [13] and are specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[1].
# 5 Network characteristics
## 5.1 Key characteristics of IP Multimedia Networks
The Internet is a conglomeration of networks utilising a common set of
protocols. IP protocols are defined in the relevant IETF RFCs. The networks
topologies may be based on LANs (e.g. Ethernet), Point-to-Point leased lines,
PSTN, ISDN, X.25 or WANs using switched technology (e.g. SMDS, ATM).
IP multimedia networks provide the ability for users to invoke IP multimedia
applications in order to send and receive (where applicable) voice and data
communications. One protocol used to manage IP multimedia sessions is the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (RFC 3261 [2]).
## 5.2 Key characteristics of UMTS IM CN Subsystem
The UMTS IM CN subsystem uses the SIP protocol to manage IP multimedia
sessions, and uses IP as the transport mechanism for both SIP session
signalling and media transport.
The UMTS IM CN subsystem shall support interworking with existing fixed and
mobile voice and IP data networks, including PSTN, ISDN, Mobile and Internet.
# 6 Interworking Reference Model for control plane interworking and user plane
interworking
Figure 2 details the reference architecture required to support interworking
between the IM CN subsystem and IP networks for IM services. Figure 3 details
the reference architecture required to support interworking between the IMS
and IP SIP networks supporting IP version 4.
NOTE: Multimedia IP networks may be connected via the Mb interface to various
network entities, such as an UE (via an GTP Tunnel reaching to the GGSN), an
MRFP, or an application server.
Figure 2: IM CN Subsystem to IP network interworking reference Architecture
without IP version interworking
Figure 3: Border Control Functions
**Mm reference point:** The call control protocol applied to the Mm interface
between CSCF and external IP networks is SIP, RFC 3261 [2], as detailed in
3GPP TS 24.229 [1]. SIP extension packages mandated by 3GPP are possibly not
supported.
**Mb reference point:** This interface is defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [5] and is
IP based. Further information is provided in 3GPP TS 29.061 [4] and 3GPP TS
26.235 [6].
**Mx reference point:** The protocol applied at the Mx reference point is not
specified within this release of the specification.
**Ix reference point:** The protocol applied at the Ix reference point is not
specified in this release of the specification.
## 6.1 Interworking Functional Entities
### 6.1.1 IBCF
This entity provides control plane functionality to connect entities following
the 3GPP profile of SIP, 3GPP TS 24.229 [1], and external SIP entities
following IETF RFC 3261 [2].
### 6.1.2 IMS-ALG
IMS-ALG functionality resides in IBCF. An IMS-ALG provides the application
level translation function for SIP and SDP in order to communicate between
IPv6 and IPv4 SIP applications or, based on operator policies between
different realms using the same IP version. The IBCF acts as a B2BUA when it
performs IMS-ALG functionality.
### 6.1.3 TrGW
The TrGW is a NAT-PT/NAPT-PT, which uses a pool of globally unique IPv4
addresses for assignment to IPv6 nodes on a dynamic basis as sessions are
initiated across the IP version boundaries. NAT-PT binds addresses in IPv6
network with addresses in IPv4 network and vice versa to provide transparent
routing between the two IP domain without requiring any changes to end points.
NAPT-PT provides additional translation of transport identifier (TCP, SCTP and
UDP port numbers). More detailed information on the NAT-PT/NAPT-PT is given in
RFC 2766 [11] and RFC 2663 [12].
The TrGW may provide the NAT/NAPT functionality between two disparate address
realms.
# 7 Control plane interworking
## 7.1 SIP with 3GPP Profile to Standard SIP Interworking
3GPP TS 24.229 [1] defines the procedures, which allow a 3GPP-IMS UE to
connect to a standard SIP terminal.
## 7.2 Additional interworking of protocols associated with services
There is no impact beyond that specified in subclause 7.1 provided the
necessary SIP extensions are supported on both sides of the interworking point
. Based on operator policy and/or service level agreements the interworking of
services may be restricted
Additional information related to interworking with services is provided
in3GPP TS 29.165 [28]..
# 8 User Plane Interworking
## 8.1 Overview
The present specification addresses user plane interworking between codec
types used for either speech or video. Codecs used for conversational services
in the PS domain are as defined in 3GPP TS 26.235 [6]. Codecs of particular
interest are described in annex A
## 8.2 Transparent User Plane
The user plane may be transported through the IM CN subsystem without being
processed by any IM CN subsystem entity. This means there is no need on the
user plane for network address (transport identifier) translation, IP version
translation and media transcoding.
In this case, the TrGW shall be thus bypassed.
## 8.3 Non-Transparent User Plane
### 8.3.1 Introduction
Non-Transparent User Plane may be related to:
1) Transcoding due to mismatch of codec, and/or
2) Network address and/or port translation due to Interworking between private
and public network or topology hiding and/or
3) Interworking between IPv4 and IPv6 (see clause 9).
# 9 IP Version Interworking at the IMS-ALG/TrGW
## 9.1 Control plane interworking
### 9.1.1 Originating Session Set-up to IPv4 SIP network
#### 9.1.1.1 Receipt of the first SDP offer
At the receipt of the first SDP offer the IMS-ALG:
\- Provides to the TrWG the IPv6 address(es) and port number(s) as received in
the c-line(s) and m-line(s) in the SDP, and
\- Requests the TrGW to bind corresponding IPv4 address(es) and port number(s)
from its pool to the received IPv6 address(es) and port number(s) to enable
the routing of user plane traffic from the IPv4 SIP network through the TrGW.
When the IMS-ALG has received the requested information from the TrGW the IMS-
ALG shall include the IPv4 address(es) and port number(s) in a new offer,
which shall be sent to the IPv4 network. The IMS-ALG shall create a SIP
message in accordance with the rules for the IMS_ALG described in subclause
9.1.4 with the following clarification:
\- The IPv4 address(es) and port number(s) shall replace the IPv6 address(es)
and port number(s) in the SDP.
#### 9.1.1.2 Receipt of the first SDP answer
At the receipt of the first SDP answer from the IPv4 network the IMS-ALG:
\- Provides to the TrGW the IPv4 address(es) and port number(s) as received in
the c-line(s) and m-line(s) in the SDP, and
\- Requests the TrGW to bind corresponding IPv6 address(es) and port number(s)
from its pool to the received IPv4 address(es) and port number(s) to enable
the routing of user plane traffic towards the IPv4 SIP network through the
TrGW.
When the IMS-ALG has received the requested information, the IMS-ALG shall
send an SDP answer to the IPv6 network. The IMS-ALG shall create the SIP
message in accordance with the rules for the IMS ALG described in subclause
9.1.4 with the following clarification:
\- The IPv6 address(es) and port number(s) shall replace the received IPv4
address(es) and port number(s) in the SDP.
### 9.1.2 Terminating Session set-up from IPv4 SIP network
#### 9.1.2.1 Receipt of an SDP offer
At the receipt of the first SDP offer the IMS-ALG:
\- Provides to the TrGW the IPv4 address(es) and port number(s) as received in
the c-lin(es) and m-lin(es) in the SDP, and
\- Requests the TrGW to bind corresponding IPv6 address(es) and port number(s)
from its pool to the received IPv4 address(es ) and port number(s) to enable
the routing of user plane traffic towards the IPv4 SIP network through the
TrGW.
When the IMS-ALG has received the requested information from the TrGW the IMS-
ALG shall send an SDP offer to the IPv6 network. The IMS-ALG shall create a
SIP message in accordance with the rules for the IMS ALG described in
subclause 9.1.4 with the following clarifications:
\- The IPv6 address(es) and port number(s) shall replace the received IPv4
address(es) and port number(s) in the SDP.
#### 9.1.2.2 Receipt of SDP answer
At the receipt of a SDP answer from the IPv6 network the IMS-ALG:
\- Provides to the TrGW the IPv6 address(es) and port number(s) as received in
the c-line(s) and m-line(s) in the SDP.
\- Requests the TrGW to bind corresponding IPv4 address(es) and port number(s)
from its pool with the received IPv6 address(es) and port number(s) to enable
the routing of user plane traffic from the IPv4 SIP network through the TrGW.
When the IMS-ALG has received the requested information, the IMS-ALG shall
send a SDP answer to the IPv4 network. The IMS-ALG shall create the SIP
message in accordance with the rules for the IMS ALG described in subclause
9.1.4 with the following clarification:
\- The IPv4 address(es) and port number(s) shall replace the received IPv6
address(es) and port number(s) in the SDP.
### 9.1.3 Change of connection information
After the dialog is established it is possible for both ends of the session to
change the connection data for the session. When the IMS-ALG/TrGW receives a
SDP offer/answer where port number(s) or IP address(es) is included., there
are four different possibilities:
1) IP address(es) or/and port number(s) have been added. In this case >
additional binding(s) shall be provided by the IMS-ALG/TrGW as > detailed for
the first SDP offer in the Clauses above;
2) IP address(es) or/and port number(s) have been deleted. In this case >
binding(s) shall be made free by the IMS-ALG/TrGW;
3) IP address(es) and port number(s) have been reassigned of the users. > In
this case the binding(s) shall reflect the reassignment;
4) No change has been made to the IP address(es) and port number(s). In > this
case no change shall be made to the existing binding(s).
### 9.1.4 Interworking of SIP messages
The IMS-ALG behaves as a SIP B2BUA when interworking SIP messages. The IMS-ALG
shall forward all SIP messages transparently with respect to all methods,
result codes, headers and attachments except as follows:
\- The IMS-ALG modifies SDP according to subclauses 9.1.1, 9.1.2 and 9.1.3;
\- When forwarding an incoming SIP request, the IMS-ALG should perform UAC
procedures towards the intended target according to IETF RFC 3261 [2], by
modifying those headers necessary to ensure that all transactions within the
dialog pass through the IMS-ALG;
\- When forwarding an incoming SIP response, the IMS-ALG should perform UAS
procedures towards the originator of the corresponding request according to
IETF RFC 3261 [2], by modifying those headers necessary to ensure that all
transactions within the dialog pass through the IMS-ALG; and
\- The IMS-ALG may perform any appropriate error recovery procedures in the
event that an incoming message contains errors inconsistent with the
forwarding procedures above.
At the receipt of a BYE request, CANCEL request or non-200 final response, the
IMS-ALG shall release the session and request the TrGW to release the bindings
established for the session.
## 9.2 User plane transport
### 9.2.1 Payload transport
The TrGW shall use the established bindings described above to transport the
messages between the IPv6 network and IPv4 network in the following way.
At the receipt of a payload message the TrGW shall:
\- Replace the received IPv4 address(es) and port number(s) in the payload
message with the corresponding IPv6 address(es) and port number(s).
\- Replace the received IPv6 address(es) and port number(s) in the payload
message with the corresponding IPv4 address(es) and port number(s).
### 9.2.2 IP header interworking
#### 9.2.2.1 IPv4 to IPv6
When the TrGW receives an IPv4 message the following codings shall be set in
the IPv6 headers of the message sent to the IPv6 network.
\- If the DF bit is set and the packet is not a fragment (i.e., the MF flag is
not set and the Fragment Offset is zero) The IPv6 headers shall be set as
described in Table 1;
\- If the DF bit is not set or the packet is a fragment the IPv6 headers shall
be set as described in Table 2.
Table 1: Derivation of IPv6 Header from IPv4 header (no fragmentation)
* * *
**IPv6 field** **Value** Version 6 Traffic Class: The default behaviour is
that the value of the IPv6 field Traffic Class field is the value of the IPv4
Type Of Service field (all 8 bits are copied). An imÂ­plementation of a TrGW
should also provide the ability to ignore the value of the IPv4 Type of
Service and always set the IPv6 traffic class field to zero. Flow label The
Ipv6 Flow Label Field is set to 0 (all zero bits) Payload Length The IPv6
Payload Length field value is the IPv4 Total length field value minus the size
of the IPv4 header and IPv4 options field length, if present. Next Header The
Ipv6 Next Header value is copied from IPv4 Protocol field Hop Limit: The IPv6
Hop Limit value is The value of IPv4 field Time To Live minus 1 Source Address
Shall be handled as the addresses of the payload message as described in
subclause 9.2.1. Destination Address Shall be handled as the addresses of the
payload message as described in subclause 9.2.1.
* * *
Table 2: Derivation of IPv6 Header from IPv4 Header (fragmentation)
* * *
**IPv6 field** **Value** Version 6 Traffic Class: The default behaviour is
that the value of the IPv6 field Traffic Class field is the value of the IPv4
Type Of Service field (all 8 bits are copied). An imÂ­plementation of a TrGW
should also provide the ability to ignore the value of the IPv4 Type of
Service and always set the IPv6 traffic class field to zero. Flow label The
Ipv6 Flow Label Field is set to 0 (all zero bits) Payload Length The IPv6
Payload Length field value is the IPv4 Total length field value plus 8 for the
fragment header minus the size of the IPv4 header and IPv4 options field
length, if present. Next Header The IPv6 Next header field is set to Fragment
header (44). Hop Limit: The IPv6 Hop Limit value is The value of IPv4 field
Time To Live minus 1 Source Address Shall be handled as the addresses of the
payload message as described in subclause 9.2.1. Destination Address Shall be
handled as the addresses of the payload message as described in subclause
9.2.1. Fragments headers  
a) next header Copied from IPv4 Protocol field b) fragment Offset Copied from
the IPv4 Fragment offset field c) More fragment bit Copied from the value of
the more fragment bit in the IPv4 flags field d) Identification The value of
this field should be mapped from the triple of the source address, destination
address and IPv4 identification field of the incoming packet/fragment to a
unique value for the source and destination address of the outgoing IPv6
packet/fragment.
* * *
#### 9.2.2.2 Abnormal cases
If IPv4 options are present in the IPv4 packet, they should be ignored i.e.,
there is no attempt to translate them. However, if an unexpired source route
option is present then the packet shall instead be discarded, and an ICMPv4
\"destination unreachable/source route failed\" Type 3/Code 5 error message
shall be returned to the sender as defined in IETF RFC 792 [16].
When a translator receives the first fragment of a fragmented UDP IPv4 packet
and the checksum field is zero the translator should drop the packet and
generate a system management event specifying at least the IP addresses and
port numbers in the packet. When it receives fragments other than the first it
should silently drop the packet since there is no port information to log.
When a translator receives an unfragmented UDP IPv4 packet and the checksum
field is zero the translator shall compute the missing UDP checksum as part of
translating the packet. Also, the translator should maintain a counter of how
many UDP checksums are generated in this manner.
#### 9.2.2.3 IPv6 to IPv4
When the TrGW receives an IPv6 message the following codings shall be set in
the IPv4 headers of the message sent to the IPv4 network.
\- If there is no IPv6 fragment header, the IPv4 header fields shall be set as
described in Table 3;
\- If there is an IPv6 fragment header, the IPv4 header fields shall be set as
described in Table 4.
Table 3: Derivation of IPv4 Header from IPv6 Header (no fragmentation)
* * *
**IPv4 field** **Value** Version 4 Internet header length 5 (No IPv4 options)
Type of Service The default behaviour is that the value of the IPv4 field Type
of service field is the value of the IPv6 Traffic class field (all 8 bits are
copied). An imÂ­plementation of a TrGW should also provide the ability to
ignore the value of the IPv6 Traffic Class and always set the IPv4 Type of
Service field to zero. Total length The IPv4 Total Length field value is the
IPv6 Payload length value plus the size of the IPv4 headers. Identification
All bits are set to zero Flags The more fragment flag is set to zero. The
Don't fragment flag is set to one. Fragment offset Set to zero Time to live
(TTL) The value of the field shall be set to the received IPv6 Hop Limit field
value minus 1. Protocol The IPv4 field Protocol shall be set to the value of
IPv6 field The next header value. Header checksum Computed once the IPv4
header has been created. Source Address Shall be handled as the addresses of
the payload message as described in subclause 9.2.1. Destination Address Shall
be handled as the addresses of the payload message as described in subclause
9.2.1.
* * *
Table 4: Derivation of IPv4 Header from IPv6 Header (fragmentation)
* * *
**IPv4 field** **Value** Version 4 Internet header length 5 (No IPv4 options)
Type of Service and Precedence: The default behaviour is that the value of the
IPv4 field Type of service field is the value of the IPv6 Traffic class field
(all 8 bits are copied). An imÂ­plementation of a TrGW should also provide the
ability to ignore the value of the IPv6 Traffic Class and always set the IPv4
Type of Service field to zero. Total length The IPv4 Total Length field value
is the IPv6 Payload length value plus the size of the IPv4 headers minus 8 for
the Fragment header, Identification The value of this field should be mapped
from the triple of the source address, destination address and IPv6
fragmentation header field "identification" of the incoming packet/fragments
to a unique value for the source and destination address of the outgoing IPv4
packet/fragments. Flags The IPv4 More Fragments flag is copied from the IPv6 M
flag in the IPv6 Fragment header. The IPv4 Don\'t Fragments flag is set to
zero allowing this packet to be fragmented by IPv4 routers. Time to live (TTL)
The value of the field shall be set to the received IPv6 Hop Limit field value
minus 1. Protocol The IPv4 field Protocol shall be set to the value of IPv6
field The next header value. Header checksum Computed once the IPv4 header has
been created Source Address Shall be handled as the addresses of the payload
message as described in subclause 9.2.1. Destination Address Shall be handled
as the addresses of the payload message as described in subclause 9.2.1.
* * *
#### 9.2.2.4 Abnormal cases
If any of an IPv6 hop-by-hop options header, destination options header, or
routing header with the Segments Left field equal to zero are present in the
IPv6 packet, they are ignored i.e., there is no attempt to translate them.
However, the Total Length field and the Protocol field shall be adjusted to
\"skip\" these extension headers.
If a routing header with a non-zero Segments Left field is present then the
packet shall be translated, and an ICMPv6 \"parameter problem/ erroneous
header field encountered\" Type 4/Code 0 error message as defined in IETF RFC
2463 [17], with the Pointer field indicating the first byte of the Segments
Left field should be returned to the sender.
### 9.2.3 Fragmentation
If the DF flag is not set and the IPv4 packet will result in an IPv6 packet
larger than 1280 bytes the TrGW shall prior to transferring it in the IPv6
network:
\- Add the fragment header to the message
\- Fragment the IPv4 packets so that their length, excluding the IPv4 header,
is at most 1232 bytes (1280 minus 40 for the IPv6 header and 8 for the
Fragment header).
### 9.2.4 Abnormal cases
As a part of decrementing the Time To Live /Hop Limit value and the TrGW
discovers that the zero value is reached the TrGW shall send an ICMPv4/ICMPv6
message with the error "time to live exceeded in transit" type 11 code 0 as
defined in IETF RFC 792 [16] and "hop limit exceeded in transit" type 3 code 0
as defined in IETF RFC 2463 [17].
###### ## Annex A (informative): Codecs used for conversational services
Codecs used for Conversational Services For codecs for conversational services
in the PS domain are defined according to 3GPP TS 26.235 [6]. These include:
\- Narrowband speech: The support of the AMR codec is mandated.
\- For wideband speech: The support of the AMR-WB codec is mandated
\- For video: The support of the H.263 profile 0 level 10 v1 is mandated, and
the support of MPEG4 visual sp @ level 0 and ITU-T Recommendation H.263 [14]
profile 3 level 10 are optional.
In non-3GPP SIP networks there are no mandatory codecs. However, the following
codecs are of interest:
\- Narrowband speech: ITU-T Recommendations G.723.1 [15], G.729 [16] and G.711
[17] are known to be commonly deployed.
\- Video codecs: ITU-T Recommendation H.263 [14] and MPEG4 are expected to be
used.
