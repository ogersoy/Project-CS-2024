# 4 Service description
## 4.1 General Service characteristics
The IMS Multimedia Telephony Service should allow multimedia conversational
communications between two or more users. It provides real time bidirectional
conversational transfer of speech, video or optionally other types of data.
The IMS Multimedia Telephony communication is point to point between terminals
communicating, or a terminal and a network entity. This communication is
usually symmetrical, but in special cases the media components present in each
direction may be different, or they may be the same but with different bit
rates and Quality of Service.
An IMS Multimedia Telephony communication can start with only one type of
media and additional types of media may or may not be added by the users as
the communication progress. Therefore a particular IMS Multimedia Telephony
communication may consist of only one type of media, e.g. speech.
IMS Multimedia Telephony service is different from other IMS based services,
such as Push to Talk over Cellular (PoC).\ Its characteristics includes the
following:
\- IMS Multimedia Telephony is a service where speech, and speech combined
with other media components, is the typical usage but the service is not
limited to always include speech, it also caters for other media or
combinations of media (e.g. text and video).
\- The IMS multimedia telephony service includes supplementary services. The
behaviour of these services is almost identical to supplementary services for
CS voice (TS 11) and PSTN/ISDN.
Note: most supplementary services are active in the set-up phase. Mid session
supplementary services such as session transfer and session hold exist.
\- The anticipated usage model is that of traditional telephony: one user
connecting to any other user, regardless of operator and access technology.
\- When a supplementary service is invoked it applies to all media components
of an IMS Multimedia Telephony communication. A supplementary service can be
activated by the user for one or more types of media components. If one or
more of these media components are present in the IMS Multimedia Telephony
communication then the supplementary service is invoked.
## 4.2 Default media handling capabilities of IMS Multimedia Telephony service
IMS Multimedia Telephony can support many different types of media.
IMS Multimedia Telephony service includes the following standardized media
capabilities:
\- Full duplex speech;
\- Real time video (simplex, full duplex), synchronized with speech if
present;
\- Text communication;
\- File transfer;
\- Video clip sharing, picture sharing, audio clip sharing. Transferred files
may be displayed/replayed on receiving terminal for specified file formats.
The support of each of these media capabilities is optional for a UE.
At least one common standardized format (e.g. JPEG, AMR) shall be supported
per media type.
The IMS Multimedia Telephony service shall support the following handling of
media
\- Adding, removing and modifying individual media to/from a IMS Multimedia
Telephony communication
# 5 Service Requirements
General service requirements as specified for IMS services in [4] apply.
# 6 Quality of Service
General QoS requirements as specified for IMS services in [4] apply.
# 7 Interworking requirements
## 7.1 Interworking with CS domain
Standardisation of interworking between the IMS domain and the CS domain for
multimedia telephony communications is provided as specified in [4].
## 7.2 Interworking with external networks
General interworking requirements with external networks as specified for IMS
services in [4] apply.
## 7.3 Media Aspects on Interworking
End to end codec negotiation shall be supported. When the codec negotiation
fails, transcoding should be provided as an operator option.
When transcoding applies, the quality degradation and additional latency due
to decoding/encoding operation shall be minimized.
To optimize the end-user experience, during the codec negotiation and subject
to operator policy, a wideband codec should be preferred over a narrowband
codec, subject to the capabilities of both ends.
# 8 Supplementary Services
## 8.1 General
This clause provides the description of the supplementary services applicable
to IMS Multimedia Telephony service.
The behaviour of IMS supplementary services, as perceived by the user, shall
be consistent with the behaviour perceived when using the equivalent
supplementary services on PSTN/ ISDN and CS mobile networks.
For each supplementary service, the following is provided:
  * a short service definition;
  * a description of the normal operation with successful outcome.
And when applicable also:
  * a description of exceptional operation or unsuccessful outcome;
  * descriptions on interaction with other supplementary services applicable to IMS Multimedia Telephony service;
  * consideration for interworking with the CS mobile and fixed services.
In general if a service is not mentioned within the interaction clause then
there is no impact.
The support of some of these services may be mandatory or optional depending
on specific country/regional regulation.
For CEPT members see annex C.
Some services are not applicable to UE accessing IMS via 3GPP accesses. See
annex D.

No impact, i.e. neither IMS supplementary service shall affect the operation
of the other IMS supplementary service.
##### 8.2.6.2.1.2 Originating Identification Restriction (OIR) {#originating-
identification-restriction-oir-2 .H6}
If the terminating party has activated the ACR service, then the OIR service
causes the execution of the ACR service in accordance with the procedures in
clause 8.2.6.1.
If the terminating party has the override capability according to the OIR
service, then the ACR service shall not apply.
##### 8.2.6.2.2 Diversion Services
NOTE: The precedence that ACR takes over the communication diversion services
does not exclude the use of forwarding functionality in the ACR functionality
itself. As an example: forwarding of anonymous communications (e.g. to a voice
mailbox), as part of the ACR functionality is possible.
If the diverted-to user has activated the ACR service, then the ACR service
shall take precedence over the communication diversion supplementary
**service** i.e. the communication shall be rejected according to the ACR
service.
##### 8.2.6.2.2.1 Communication Forwarding Unconditional (CFU)
{#communication-forwarding-unconditional-cfu-2 .H6}

i.e. the communication shall be rejected according to the ACR service.
##### 8.2.6.2.2.2 Communication Forwarding Busy (CFB) {#communication-
forwarding-busy-cfb-2 .H6}
If the forwarding party has activated the ACR service, then the ACR service
shall take precedence over the communication forwarding busy service i.e. the
communication shall be rejected according to the ACR service.
##### 8.2.6.2.2.3 Communication Forwarding No Reply (CFNR) {#communication-
forwarding-no-reply-cfnr-3 .H6}
If the forwarding party has activated the ACR service:
  * no impact, i.e. neither IMS supplementary service shall affect the operation of the other IMS supplementary service.
NOTE: If the **originating party** has restricted its identity due to the OIR
service the communication will not be presented.
##### 8.2.6.2.2.4 Communication Forwarding on Not Logged-in (CFNL)
{#communication-forwarding-on-not-logged-in-cfnl-2 .H6}
If the forwarding party has activated the ACR service, then the ACR service
shall take precedence over the communication forwarding on not logged in
service i.e. the communication shall be rejected according to the ACR service.
##### 8.2.6.2.2.5 Communication Forwarding on Subscriber Not Reachable (CFNRc)
{#communication-forwarding-on-subscriber-not-reachable-cfnrc-2 .H6}
If the forwarding party has activated the ACR service, then the ACR service
shall take precedence over the communication forwarding on subscriber not
reachable service i.e. the communication shall be rejected according to the
ACR service.
##### 8.2.6.2.3 Communication Waiting (CW)
If the terminating party has activated the ACR service, then the ACR service
shall take precedence over the Communication Waiting service. The ACR service
can be activated while a communication is waiting without changing the state
of the waiting communication session.
##### 8.2.6.2.4 Completion of Communications to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
NOTE: A CCBS recall (from the network to the originating party) resulting from
the completion of communications to busy subscribers shall not be rejected due
to the application of the ACR service.
Assuming the originating party connects to the terminating party and the
terminating party activates the ACR service (or has activated the ACR
service), two cases are possible:
a) The ACR service was activated by the terminating party before the
originating party originates a communication:
  * No impact, i.e. no IMS supplementary service shall affect the operation of the other IMS supplementary service.
NOTE: If the originating party has restricted its identity due to the OIR
service and if the terminating party is busy, the originating party will
receive no busy indication, and the completion of communications to busy
subscriber service will not apply. Instead the communication session attempt
shall be rejected according to the normal procedures of the ACR service.
b) The ACR service is activated by the terminating party after the originating
party has activated the completion of communications to busy subscriber
service on the terminating party:
  * If the terminating party activates the ACR service after the originating party has activated the completion of communications to busy subscriber service on the terminating party, then the communication resulting from the completion of communications to busy subscriber service shall be rejected if the originating party has restricted its identity due to the OIR service.
#### 8.2.6.3 Interoperability with PSTN/ISDN
The IMS Multimedia Telephony service shall support the interoperability of the
ACR services with PSTN/ISDN Supplementary Services and vice‑versa. The scope
of this interworking may result in a limited service capability.

{#communication-forwarding-on-subscriber-not-reachable-cfnrc-3 .H6}
The CFNRc service enables a user to have the network redirect all incoming
communications, or just those associated with a specific service, when called
mobile subscriber's address is not reachable (e.g. there is no IP connectivity
to the user's terminal, or, in the case of a mobile device, it is not in radio
coverage), to another address. The CFNRc service may operate on all
communications, or just those associated with specified services. The user\'s
ability to originate communications is unaffected by the CFNRc service.
Note: It may be affected by the reason that have triggered the loss of
connectivity, e.g. in the mobile case if the mobile subscriber is de-
registered, if there is radio congestion or if the mobile subscriber for
example is being out of radio coverage,
As a service provider option, a subscription option can be provided to enable
the user to receive an indication that the CFNRc service has been activated.
This indication may be provided when the user originates a communication if
the CFNRc service has been activated for the user and for the service
requested for the communication.
The maximum number of diversions permitted for each communication is a service
provider option. The service provider shall define the upper limit of
diversions. When counting the number of diversions, all types of diversion are
included.

### 8.2.10 Communication Barring (CB)
#### 8.2.10.1 Definition
The group of Communication Restriction Services includes two services:
  * Outgoing Communications Barring (OCB).
This service allows a user to bar certain categories of outgoing
communications. The network shall provide the capability for a user to select
a set of categories (e.g. identities or range of identities) for barring. The
type of barring is chosen by the user at provision time, and shall be valid
for all outgoing communications. The network shall provide the capability for
the user to bar outgoing communications based on user defined identities or
identity ranges. Barring of an outgoing communication for a specific identity,
a number of specific identities, or a range of identities shall be dependent
on an entry in a OCB identity list held in the network. This list shall either
be a \"black list\" or \"white list\". A \"black list\" shall contain the
identities or identity ranges to be barred by the network for outgoing
communications. A \"white list\" shall contain the identities or identity
ranges that shall be allowed by the network for outgoing communications, i.e.
all identities not in the \"white list\" shall be barred.
The ability of the served user to receive communications and to originate
emergency communications shall be unaffected by OCB.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-15] and [E-16].
  * Incoming Communications Barring (ICB).
This service allows a user to bar certain categories of incoming
communications. The service also allows the user to have the barring of
incoming communications activated always or only during certain conditions.
The network shall provide the capability for a user to select from a set of
categories (e.g. identities or range of identities) for barring. The type of
barring is chosen by the user at provision time and may be valid for all
incoming communications, or be limited to a specific service group or certain
conditions (e.g. when the user is roaming).
The ability of the served user to set-up outgoing communications shall be
unaffected by ICB.
The ICB service includes a roaming condition. The roaming condition is set to
true when the served user is roaming.

service capability.
### 8.2.11 Completion of Communications to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
#### 8.2.11.1 Definition
The CCBS service enables originating party, encountering a busy terminating
party, to have the communication completed without having to make a new
communication attempt when the terminating party becomes free.
When originating party requests the CCBS service, the network will monitor for
terminating party becoming free.
When terminating party becomes free then the network will wait a short time in
order to allow the resources to be re-used for originating a communication. If
the resources are not re-used by terminating party within this time, then the
network will automatically inform originating party that terminating party has
become free. Originating party can generate the CCBS communication to
terminating party.
When originating party accepts the CCBS recall, then the network will
automatically generate a CCBS communication to terminating party.
NOTE: A service provided to terminating party which prevents the registration
of CCBS requests is outside the scope of the present document.
During CCBS recall, information shall be provided which indicates a CCBS
recall. The information provided in the original communication attempt shall
be included in the CCBS recall.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-9].
#### 8.2.11.2 Service interactions with other IMS supplementary services

##### 8.2.11.2.2 Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR)
A CCBS recall (from the network to the originating party) resulting from the
completion of communications to busy subscribers shall not be rejected due to
the application of the ACR service.
Assume the originating party connects to the terminating party and the
terminating party activates the ACR service or has activated the ACR service:
  * The ACR service is activated by the terminating party after the originating party has activated the completion of communications to busy subscriber service on the terminating party:
```{=html}
``` \- If the terminating party activates the ACR service after the
originating party has activated the completion of communications to busy
subscriber service on the terminating party, then the communication resulting
from the completion of communications to busy subscriber service shall be
rejected if the originating party has restricted its identity due to the OIR
service.
##### 8.2.11.2.3 Communication DIVersion **(CDIV)**
CCBS recalls shall never be diverted. They shall be provided to the original
originating party.
CCBS can not be activated on a diverted communication.
##### 8.2.11.2.4 Communication Waiting **(CW)**
NOTE: For a waiting communication, terminating party is not considered as
busy.
If the Communication Waiting indication cannot be provided at the terminating
party, originating party will receive busy indication and can invoke the CCBS
service to terminating party.
CCBS requests in the terminating party\'s CCBS queue shall only be processed
if there are no communications waiting.
##### 8.2.11.2.5 Communication HOLD (HOLD)
No impact, i.e. this IMS supplementary service should not affect any other IMS
supplementary service.
NOTE 1: When receiving a CCBS communication indication, originating party may
invoke the communication hold service in order to make interface resources
available for the establishment of the CCBS communication.
NOTE 2: When originating party is busy or CCBS busy and is notified that
terminating party is free, invocation of the communication hold service will
not result in the CCBS communication being established.
##### 8.2.11.2.6 Communication Barring (CB)
The originating party calls the terminating party who is busy, and then the
originating party invokes CCBS. If the originating party then invokes OCB
before the terminating party becomes free, the CCBS communication may be
rejected due to the OCB invocation.
##### 8.2.11.2.7 Completion of Communications to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
A user can be both an \"originating party\" and a \"terminating party\"
simultaneously, i.e. that user can have activated the CCBS service and have
CCBS requests outstanding whilst at the same time that user can be the
destination of CCBS requests from other users.
If a user receives a CCBS recall while that terminating party\'s CCBS queue is
being processed, then the CCBS recall shall take priority over the handling of
the terminating party\'s CCBS queue. The handling of CCBS requests activated
by this user shall have priority over the handling of CCBS requests activated
by other users on this user.
If one of the user\'s CCBS requests matures as a result, then the user shall
be provided a CCBS recall or notification. The terminating party idle guard
timer, if running, shall be cancelled.
##### 8.2.11.2.8 Advice Of Charge services **(AOC)**
Charging information can be provided for the original communication, and for
the resulting CCBS communication.
#### 8.2.11.3 Interoperability with PSTN/ISDN

scope of this interworking may result in a limited service capability.
### 8.2.12 Message Waiting Indication (MWI)
#### 8.2.12.1 Definition
The MWI service enables the network, upon the request of a controlling user to
indicate to the receiving user, that there is at least one message waiting.
The indication is sent to the receiving user when a message is deposited.
Optionally, the network may send an indication to the user that there are no
more unread message in the mail box. This indication may be send when the last
unread message is read.
NOTE: As an example, a voice message is stored by the network for a particular
user. The network then provides the MWI to the user to indicate there is a
message for retrieval. Having received this indication, the receiving user can
subsequently access the mail box, to listen to the message.
The means by which the receiving user accesses and manages the mail box voice
message service are outside the scope of the present document.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-13].

### 8.2.13 CONFerence (CONF)
#### 8.2.13.1 Definition
The CONF service enables a user to participate in and control a simultaneous
communication involving a number of users.
When the CONF service is invoked, conference resources are allocated to the
served user.
Once a conference is active, users can join and leave a conference, and remote
users can be added to or removed from the conference.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-7] and [E-8].
Conference participants can request to be informed of these actions. This
information can include details beyond that described in [E-7] and [E-8],
about other participants including their identity.

AOC is a group of services as follows:
  * Advice Of Charge: charging information at communication Set-up time (AOC-S);
The advice of charge at communication set-up service provides the user with
information about the charging rates at the time of communication
establishment or during the communication in the case of charging rates
changes. The charge information provided relates to the charges incurred on
the network to which the served user is attached.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-10] for AoC-S on a permanent mode.
  * Advice Of Charge: charging information During the communication (AOC-D);
The advice of charge during the communication service enables the user to
receive information on the recorded charges for a communication during the
active phase of the communication. The provided charging information may be
exchanged between different operator domain if those operators have
interconnect agreements to do so.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-11] for AoC-S on a permanent mode.
  * Advice Of Charge: charging information at the End of the communication (AOC-E)
The advice of charge at end of communication service provides the user with
charging information for a communication when the communication is terminated.
Dependent on the option chosen at the time of subscription, the information
can be sent for all communications, or on a per communication basis. The
charge information provided relates to the charges incurred on the network to
which the served user is attached.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-12] for AoC-S on a permanent mode.

### 8.2.15 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)
#### 8.2.15.1 Definition
The ECT service enables a transferring party A to transform two of that
party\'s communications (e.g. an active communication and a communication on
hold, to parties B and C), each of which can be an incoming communication or
an outgoing communication, into a new communication between party B and party
C.
Prior to transfer, the media session shall have been established on the
communication between transferring party A and party B. On the communication
between transferring party A and party C, either the media session shall have
been established prior to transfer, or, as a service provider option, transfer
can occur while the communication to party C is requested or being established
(i.e. the media session has not yet been established).
The minimum requirement should be to perform an \"immediate\" communication
transfer for an incoming communication, without waiting on a response from
party C. The service should be applicable independent of whether party B and
party C are IMS users or not.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-18].
The use of ECT on an emergency call by a user that is not the PSAP, shall be
precluded.
#### 8.2.15.2 Service interactions with other IMS supplementary services
##### 8.2.15.2.1 Identification services
##### 8.2.15.2.1.1 Terminating Identification Restriction (TIR) {#terminating-
identification-restriction-tir-3 .H6}
A terminating party\'s restriction requirements from the original
communication shall be used in order to restrict the presentation of that
party\'s identity to the other user in a transferred communication.
NOTE: If the media flow(s) is established on the communication to party C
after transfer, the presentation of the identity of party C shall be
restricted according to party C\'s Terminating identification restriction
service (i.e. as for the normal operation of the Terminating identification
restriction service).
##### 8.2.15.2.2 Communication Barring (CB)
In case the transferring party A has outgoing communication barring active
towards party C, transferring party As request for communication transfer of
party B to party C shall also be barred, if it occurs in relation to the
establishment of the communication to C.
##### 8.2.15.2.3 CONFerence (CONF)
The conference controller cannot transfer the conference to another party.
NOTE: Conferees can invoke the ECT service in order to transfer their
connection to the conference to another party after that connection has been
established.
##### 8.2.15.2.4 Advice Of Charge (AOC)
##### 8.2.15.2.4.0 General {#general-1 .H6}
This services does not apply to UE accessing from mobile 3GPP access networks.
##### 8.2.15.2.4.1 Advice Of Charge at communication Set-up (AOC-S) {#advice-
of-charge-at-communication-set-up-aoc-s .H6}
When party A transfers a communication, AOC-S shall be considered as
completed.
For party B and party C, no impact, i.e. this IMS supplementary service should
not affect any other IMS supplementary service.
##### 8.2.15.2.4.2 Advice Of Charge During the communication (AOC-D) {#advice-
of-charge-during-the-communication-aoc-d .H6}
When party A transfers a communication and has activated AOC-D, the charge up
to that time shall be sent as a subtotal charge for that communication. The
AOC-D service shall then be considered as completed.
NOTE: If party A had activated the AOC-D, then party A will receive
information separately for both of the communications.
For party B and party C, no impact, i.e. this IMS supplementary service should
not affect any other IMS supplementary service.
##### 8.2.15.2.4.3 Advice Of Charge at the End of a communication (AOC-E)
{#advice-of-charge-at-the-end-of-a-communication-aoc-e .H6}
If a party A is charged for the transferred part of the communication and has
activated the AOC-E, then either:
a) the charging information shall be sent to party A when the transferred
communication is terminated; or
b) when the communications are transferred, party A shall be informed that
charging information is not available. The AOC-E shall then be considered as
completed.
For party B and party C, no impact, i.e. this IMS supplementary service should
not affect any other IMS supplementary service.
##### 8.2.15.2.5 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)
The ECT service can be invoked simultaneously by any of the parties on an
active communication, but this is not regarded as a normal situation. The
network shall not explicitly prevent this occurring.
Therefore, both parties (party A and party B) in a normal communication, who
have each subscribed to the ECT service, can simultaneously transfer the
communication. That is, if party A and party B are involved in a communication
on which the connection has been established, party A can transfer the
communication to party C and party B can transfer the communication to another
party.
NOTE: Mechanisms which prevent the ECT service from resulting in a connection
which contains no parties able to terminate the communication may result in
rejection of simultaneous requests to invoke the ECT service by the parties
involved in the communication.
#### 8.2.15.3 Interoperability with PSTN/ISDN and CS mobile networks
No restrictions.
### 8.2.16 Reverse charging
#### 8.2.16.1 Definition
The reverse charging at communication set up time service allows the
terminating party to be charged for the entire communication. Only usage based
charges can be applied to the terminating party. The service shall be
requested by the originating party at communication set up time. The
terminating party must receive an explicit indication of a reverse charge
communication request.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-19].
#### 8.2.16.2 Service interactions with other IMS supplementary services
None.

### 8.2.17 Closed User Group (CUG)
#### 8.2.17.1 Definition
The CUG service enables users to form groups of members, whose communication
profile is restricted for incoming and outgoing communications. Members of a
specific CUG can communicate among themselves but not, in general, with users
outside the group.
Specific CUG members can have additional capabilities that allow them to
initiate outgoing communications to users outside the group, and/or to accept
incoming communications from users outside the group. Specific CUG members can
have additional restrictions that prevent outgoing communications to other
members of the CUG, or prevent incoming communications from other members of
the CUG.
A closed user group consists of a number of members from one or more public,
and/or private networks. Identification of each member shall be according to
the requirements in [8]. A specific user may be a member of one or more CUGs.
Subscription to a closed user group shall be defined for all communication
services, or in relation to one, or to a list of communication services.

by the IMS Multimedia Telephony service on the original communication shall be
used for the communication forwarding and by this means CUG restrictions shall
be checked and met for the communication between the originating party and the
forwarded-to party.\ In the case of multiple forwarding, CUG restrictions
between the originating party and the forwarding party have to be checked and
met at each intermediate forwarding point. In addition, CUG restrictions
between the originating party and forwarded-to party shall be met end-to-end.
The outgoing communication barring information of the forwarding party shall
not be used to determine whether the communication can be forwarded.
The CUG information sent to the \"forwarded-to\" destination shall the same
CUG information of the originating party that was sent from the originating
network.
##### 8.2.17.2.1.2 Communication Forwarding Busy (CFB)
See interactions with CFU 8.2.17.2.1.1

for the deflected part of the communication and by this means CUG restrictions
shall be checked and met for the communication between the originating party
and the deflected-to party.
In the case of multiple deflections, CUG restrictions between the originating
party and the deflecting party have to be checked and met at each intermediate
deflecting point. In addition, CUG restrictions between the originating party
and deflected-to party shall be met end-to-end.\ When a communication is
deflected, a new check of the CUG restrictions between the originating party
and the deflected-to party is made at the \"deflected-to\" destination. The
CUG information sent to the \"deflected-to\" destination is the same CUG
information of the originating party that was sent from the originating
network.
The outgoing communication barring information of the deflecting party shall
not be used to determine whether the communication can be deflected.
NOTE: CUG restrictions were checked and met for the communication between the
originating party and the deflecting party when the communication was offered
to the deflecting party.
##### 8.2.17.2.2 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)
The two communications shall use the same CUG for the transfer to be
successful.
NOTE: CUG restrictions between users will have been checked when the first
communication is established. Similarly, CUG restrictions between users will
have been checked when establishing the second communication.
##### 8.2.17.2.3 Three-Party (3PTY)
For the successful invocation of the three party service any CUG restrictions
applied to one communication shall match with any CUG restrictions applied to
the other communication.
##### 8.2.17.2.4 CONFerence (CONF)
When the communication involving the first conferee is added to the
conference, then the conference shall assume the CUG of that communication.\
In order to add a subsequent communication to the conference, then the CUG of
that communication shall be checked against the CUG of the conference.
#### 8.2.17.3 Interoperability with PSTN/ISDN
The IMS Multimedia Telephony service shall support the interoperability of the
CUG service with the PSTN/ISDN and vice versa.No restrictions.
### 8.2.18 Three-Party (3PTY)
#### 8.2.18.1 Definition
The 3PTY service enables a user to establish, participate in and control a
simultaneous communication involving a number of users.
The 3PTY service can be invoked by the served user who is involved in at least
two calls (one active communication and at least one held communication), each
of which may be an incoming or outgoing communication.
The connections shall be established on each of the two communications prior
to the invocation of the 3PTY service.
3PTY communication setup is equivalent to a three party conference created on
request of the served user from existing communication sessions, this is
equivalent to three party conference creation in CONF, For this reason 3PTY
can be seen as a special case of CONF and most of service interactions for
CONF apply also to 3PTY.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-21].
#### 8.2.18.2 Service interactions with other IMS supplementary services
##### 8.2.18.2.1 Terminating Identification Presentation (OIR)

##### 8.2.18.2.3 Three-Party (3PTY)
A, B and C are in a three-way conversation that was created by B invoking the
3PTY service. A can create a second three-way conversation involving the
original three-way conversation and D by invoking the 3PTY service.
##### 8.2.18.2.4 CONFerence (CONF)
A, B and C are involved in a conference that was created by B invoking the
CONF service. A can create a three-way conversation involving the original
conference call and D by invoking the 3PTY service.
NOTE: It is FFS whether there is a conflict with the requirement expressed by
8.2.13.2.2, considering that 3PTY is just a special case of CONF.
##### 8.2.18.3 Interoperability with PSTN/ISDN
The IMS Multimedia Telephony service shall support the interoperability of the
3PTY service with PSTN/ISDN supplementary service 3PTY and vice-versa. The
scope of this interworking may result in a limited service capability.
### 8.2.19 Flexible Alerting (FA)
#### 8.2.19.1 Definition
Flexible Alerting (FA) causes a call to a Pilot Identity to branch the call
into several legs to alert several FA group members simultaneously. The first
leg to be answered is connected to the calling party. The other call legs are
abandoned.
FA group members are alerted by dialling the public addressable identity (e.g.
Public User Identity) associated with the FA group (i.e., a E.164 number or a
SIP URI), which is referred to as the Pilot Identity. The Pilot Identity maps
to a set of public addressable identities (e.g. PUI or GRUU) where each
identity references a member of the FA group. The FA group consists of a list
of identities, and can be configured by the user or the operator.
In FA, there are two configuration options for busy indication: Single User
Busy, and Multiple User Busy. The configuration of the option for a particular
FA group shall be performed by the operator.
\- For Single User Busy, the FA Group returns a busy indication if any group
member indicates busy before the call is answered.
\- For Multiple User Busy, the FA Group returns a busy indication if all
accessible members indicate busy.

### 8.2.22 Completion of Communications on No Reply (CCNR)
#### 8.2.22.1 Definition
The CCNR service enables the originating party, encountering a terminating
party who does not answer the communication (No Reply), to have the
communication completed without having to make a new communication attempt
when the terminating party becomes not busy after having initiated an
activity.
When the originating party requests the CCNR service, the network will monitor
for the terminating party becoming not busy after having initiated an
activity.
When the terminating party becomes not busy after having initiated an
activity, then the network will wait a short time in order to allow the
resources to be re-used for originating a communication. If the resources are
not re-used by the terminating party within this time, then the network will
automatically recall the originating party.
When the originating party accepts the CCNR recall, then the network will
automatically generate a CCNR call to the terminating party.
NOTE: A service provided to the terminating party which prevents the
registration of CCNR requests is outside the scope of the present document.
During CCNR recall, information shall be provided which indicates a CCNR
recall. The information provided in the original communication attempt shall
be included in the CCNR recall.
This service description is based on the service description described in
[E-23].
#### 8.2.22.2 Service interactions with other IMS supplementary services
##### 8.2.22.2.1 Identification services
###### 8.2.22.2.1.1 Originating Identification Presentation (OIP)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
NOTE: If the originating party accepts a CCNR recall, the resulting CCNR call
is a basic communication and the terminating party can receive originating
identification presentation.
###### 8.2.22.2.1.2 Originating Identification Restriction (OIR)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
NOTE: If the originating party has invoked originating identification
restriction and the terminating party accepts a CCNR recall, then the
resulting CCNR call is a basic communication and the terminating party will
not receive the originating identification of the originating party.
###### 8.2.22.2.1.3 Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
###### 8.2.22.2.1.4 Terminating Identification Restriction (TIR)

service.
##### 8.2.22.2.2 Advice Of Charge services (AOC)
Charging information can be given for the original communication, and for the
resulting CCNR communication.
##### 8.2.22.2.3 Communication Waiting (CW)
CCNR requests in the CCNR queue of the terminating party shall only be
processed if there are no communications waiting. In other situations there is
no impact between the CW and the CCNR service.
##### 8.2.22.2.4 Communication HOLD (HOLD)
No impact, i.e. neither supplementary service shall affect the operation of
the other supplementary service.
NOTE 1: When receiving a CCNR recall indication, the originating party may
invoke the communication hold service in order to make interface resources
available for the establishment of the CCNR communication.
NOTE 2: When the originating party is busy or CCNR busy and is notified that
the terminating party is not busy, invocation of the communication hold
service will not result in the CCNR communication being established.
##### 8.2.22.2.5 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
##### 8.2.22.2.6 Closed User Group (CUG)
Closed user group information from the original communication shall also be
included in the CCNR communication.
NOTE: Closed user group information is not included in the check for a
compatible terminal. If a terminal performs an internal closed user group
check and uses the closed user group information provided on a communication
to determine whether, or not, to inform the user of the incoming
communication, then such a terminal may react positively to the check for a
compatible terminal due to the absence of closed user group information, but
due to the internal closed user group check such a terminal may then not
inform the user of the arrival of the resulting CCNR call.
##### 8.2.22.2.7 Completion of communications services
###### 8.2.22.2.7.1 Completion of Communications to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
A user can be both an originating party and a terminating party
simultaneously, i.e. that user can have activated the CCNR service or the
completion of communications to busy subscriber (CCBS) service and have CCNR
requests or CCBS requests outstanding whilst at the same time that user can be
the destination of CCNR requests or CCBS requests from other users.
CCBS requests and CCNR requests against the same terminating party shall be
queued in the same queue.
If a user receives a CCNR recall or CCBS recall (i.e. as originating party)
while that user\'s queue as terminating party is being processed, then the
CCNR recall or CCBS recall shall take priority over the handling of that
user\'s queue. The handling of CCNR requests and CCBS requests activated by
this user (i.e. as originating party) shall have priority over the handling of
CCNR requests and CCBS requests activated by other users on this user (i.e. as
terminating party).
If one of the user\'s CCNR requests can be processed, then this user (see
first paragraph) shall be given a CCNR recall or notification as described in
[E-23] clause 5. The served user\'s terminating party idle guard timer, if
running, shall be cancelled. The processing of CCBS requests shall be
according to the requirements of the CCBS supplementary service.
If a network supports the option to retain CCNR requests (see [E-23] subclause
5.3.3.1 b)), then CCBS requests shall be retained when a CCBS call encounters
a busy destination.
If the network checks for identical requests in the user's queue, the check
shall include both CCNR requests and CCBS requests.
If an orgininating party has a CCBS recall pending on arrival of a CCNR
recall, this should be treated in the same way as in the case where the
originating party is CCNR busy (see [E-23] subclause 5.2.3 and subclause
5.3.3.2 b)).
###### 8.2.22.2.7.2 Completion of Communications on No Reply (CCNR)
A user can be both a originating party and a terminating party simultaneously,
i.e. that user can have activated the CCNR service and have CCNR requests
outstanding whilst at the same time that user can be the destination of CCNR
requests from other users.
If a user receives a CCNR recall while that user\'s CCNR queue as terminating
party is being processed, then the CCNR recall shall take priority over the
handling of the CCNR queue. The handling of CCNR requests activated by this
user shall have priority over the handling of CCNR requests activated by other
users on this user.
If one of the user\'s CCNR requests can be processed as a result, then this
user (see first paragraph) shall be given a CCNR recall or notification as
described in [E-23] clause 5. The served user\'s terminating party idle guard
timer, if running, shall be cancelled.

credentials.
###### ## Annex A (informative): General terminal guidelines
# A.1 Service state indication
It is considered useful to indicate to the user the current state, notably the
activated state of those services which can lead to communications not being
offered. For example, an active CFU results in no communication being
presented.
Generally speaking any \"not usual\" state of a service should be indicated on
the terminal: CFU activated, CW deactivated, OIR in permanent mode activated,
etc.
In the case of services which can be remotely controlled from another terminal
or a server, the terminal should receive this information from the network.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Service interactions table
Table B.1 summarizes the service interactions between pairs of IMS
supplementary services, as identified in section 8 of this document.
Each case of the table represents the scenario where services on the
horizontal row heading are invoked when services on the vertical column
heading are already active.
The case is filled with one of three possible options: character \"Y \"
indicates interaction has been identified between the corresponding service
pair and described in the present document, character \"N\" indicates no
interaction has been identified and no information is provided in the present
document, '-' is for scenarios which are not applicable.

Only these services apply to UEs using a mobile 3GPP access:
Originating Identification Presentation (OIP)
> Originating Identification Restriction (OIR)
>
> Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP)
>
> Terminating Identification Restriction (TIR)
>

> Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)
NOTE: Communication Waiting service may be provided entirely by means of a
equivalent features in the UE. In this case this service does not need to be
supported by the network.
Additionally, EN 301 082 (OCB-fixed) does not apply to 2G and 3G Mobile
terminals, for which the functionality is specified by means of Operator
Determined Barring [6] and not through supplementary services.
###### ## Annex Da (normative): Network determined user busy.
The capability of network determined user busy is a network option.
The network may determine busy conditions at the time an incoming IMS
Multimedia Telephony session is about to be offered.
The conditions for network determined user busy are identified, on a per
subscription basis, based on the availability of limited resources assigned to
the terminating user, or due to other information such as presence.
The conditions for network determined \"user busy\" include:
\- the maximum number of total communications permitted has been reached;
\- the maximum number of simultaneous media streams supported at the given
subscriber\'s interface(s) has been reached;
\- the maximum bandwidth supported at the given subscriber\'s interface(s) has
been reached.
\- subscriber making himself "busy" in a subscriber profile, involved in the
incoming multimedia telephony session.
The network determined user busy condition may be used to trigger certain
services (e.g. Call Forwarding on Busy, Call Waiting on Busy), or reject the
session, or both. If the session rejection is propagated back to the
originator, a \"user busy\" indication must be provided as the cause of the
rejection.
In addition, a further condition, \"approaching network determined user busy\"
that is related to the Network determined user busy condition, may be
provided. This condition may be used to trigger certain services (e.g. Call
Waiting). However, this condition is not a busy condition and shall not cause
a \"user busy\" indication being sent towards the session originator.
The conditions for approaching network determined user busy are identified, on
a per subscription basis, based on the availability of limited resources
assigned to the terminating user.
The conditions for approaching network determined user busy include:
\- a pre-determined number, or less, of communications are available (i.e. the
maximum number of communications minus the current number); or
\- a pre-determined number, or less, of simultaneous media streams available
(i.e. the maximum number of simultaneous media streams minus the current
number); or
\- a certain limit in the bandwidth used at the given subscriber\'s
interface(s) has been reached.
