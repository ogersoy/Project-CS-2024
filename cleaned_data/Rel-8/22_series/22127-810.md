# 1 Scope
This document specifies the stage 1 requirements for realisation of an Open
Service Access (OSA).
OSA enables applications to make use of network functionality through an open
standardised interface (the OSA API). OSA provides the glue between
applications and network functionality. In this way applications implementing
the services become independent from the underlying network technology.
Applications which make use of network functionality offered through the OSA
interface are not standardised by 3GPP.
The network functionality offered through the OSA interface may or may not be
standardised by 3GPP.
OSA is one toolkit, amongst others, that enables certain aspects of the
requirements of the Virtual Home Environment (VHE) concept to be realised.

# 4 General Description of OSA
In order to be able to implement future applications/end user services that
are not yet known today, a highly flexible Framework for Services is required.
The Open Service Access (OSA) enables applications implementing the services
to make use of network functionality. Network functionality offered to
applications is defined in terms of a set of Service Capability Features
(SCFs). These SCFs provide functionality of network capabilities which is
accessible to applications through the standardised OSA interface upon which
service developers can rely when designing new services (or
enhancements/variants of already existing ones).
The aim of OSA is to provide a standardised, extensible and scalable interface
that allows for inclusion of new functionality in the network with a minimum
impact on the applications using the OSA interface.
# 5 The role of OSA within the VHE framework for services
The goal of standardisation in 3GPP with respect to services is to provide a
framework within which services can be created based on standardised service
capability features. 3GPP services will generally not rely on the traditional
detailed service engineering (evident for supplementary services in second-
generation systems), but instead provides services using generic toolkits.
OSA is one of these toolkits, standardised within 3GPP, for the support of
services within 3GPP system (see chapter 5.1).
Services can be implemented by applications using service capability features,
which are accessible via the OSA interface towards these SCFs in the network.
Figure 1: Applications access Service Capability Features\ via the
standardised OSA Application Interface
## 5.1 Physical location of applications using the OSA interface
The physical location of applications accessing the OSA application
programming interface is an implementation matter. This TS places no
requirements on the physical location of the applications accessing the OSA
application programming interface.
The only requirement on such applications accessing the OSA application
programming interface is that they shall only do so via the framework for
services.
The architectural support of the OSA application programming interface shall
permit applications access to the OSA API independent of where the
applications are physically executing.
# 6 High level requirements to OSA
The following high level requirements apply to the OSA application programming
interface (API). The standardised API shall be:
\- independent of vendor specific solutions;
\- independent of programming languages, operating systems, underlying
communication technologies, etc. used in the service capabilities;
\- secure, scalable and extensible;
\- independent of the location where service capabilities are implemented;
\- independent of supported server capabilities in the network;
\- independent of the transport mechanism between the service capability
features server and the application server;
\- It shall be possible for an OSA application to continue operation in case
of a consecutive upgrade of the underlying OSA capabilities. This ability to
operate may be limited to a specific time period which is managed by the
network operator.
\- Access to Service Capability Features shall be realised using modern state
of the art access technologies, e.g. distributed object oriented technique and
Web Services technologies might be considered.;
\- OSA shall be aligned as far as possible with equivalent and related work in
other bodies, such as, OMA, Parlay and JAIN;
\- OSA shall allow applications access to home network service capability
features. Access to Service capability features in another network shall be
possible.;
\- When access to Service capability features in another network or
administrative domain exists, the following requirements apply:
\- The application shall not be aware that the SCF is in another network
\- The SCF shall not need to support additional functionality in order to be
accessed from a different network
\- The network providing the SCF shall be able to control the visibility and
usage of the SCF by another network.
\- It is not required that network entities, which provide the implementation
of OSA interfaces (SCFs), be mappable to 3GPP standardised functionality, nor
that the existence of a standardised interface / protocol to communicate with
3GPP standardized network elements is required.Thus it is permissible to e.g.
build a OSA API function into a WAP gateway to retrieve terminal capabilities
from terminal supporting the WAP protocol.
Note: If the network entity, to which OSA provides an API interface, is a 3GPP
standardised entity and if a standardised interface / protocol to communicate
with that network entity exists it is recommended that 3GPP defines a mapping
of the OSA API functions to that interface / protocol.
\- OSA shall allow Service Capability Features to communicate with backup
instances of an application in the case where the primary application instance
is not responding. This shall be possible also when the primary and backup
instances of the application are physically located in different locations.
\- OSA shall enable an operator to set policies (e.g. based on the need of
load distribution) on how OSA shall utilize the underlying network system.
# 7 Void
# 8 Charging requirements
The charging functionality of OSA allows an application to raise a charge
against a subscriber\'s account for goods and services provided to her. It
enables the invoicing, by the operator, of soft (e.g. download of software,
music,...) and hard goods (e.g. CDs, books,...), which potentially are
provided by third parties.
Additionally, the charging functionality of OSA shall provide for the
maintenance of non-monetary subscriber accounts. An application may add or
deduct non-monetary units to or from these accounts.
The responsibility for the subscriber accounts can be assigned to either the
home network or elsewhere.:
  * If the home network does not handle the accounts itself, charging requests are sent from the home network (and possible other applications) to a dedicated charging application, typically a charging centre. This case is out of scope of OSA.
```{=html}
``` \- If the accounts are handled by the home network, the operator takes
care of them.\ They may be used to charge for network resource usage (_call
charging_ , as it is done today) as well as any non-telecommunication related
activity (any _E-commerce activity like_ _service usage_**,** _online
purchases_...)
OSA shall provide sufficient functions to support charging when the accounts
are handled by the home network.
Two cases need to be considered in more detail:
> **Call, Session and Event Charging** : OSA shall enable applications to
> control the charge of a call, a session (PS Session or IM Session) and / or
> an event that is under supervision of this application. OSA shall allow an
> application to provide additional charging information to the network;
>
> **Service Usage** (e.g. Online Purchases): On the other hand, OSA shall
> allow to employ the charging capabilities of the network to charge
> subscribers for any kind of service or even online purchases. Calculation of
> the charge may be based on monetary and/or non monetary grounds.
Beyond this, there are **general** charging **functions** on subscriber
accounts (monetary and non-monetary) that shall be available via OSA:
  * Query the current account balance and current reservations.
  * Monitor account access (send notifications if charges or recharges are applied to a subscriber's account).
  * Retrieve the history of the transactions
# 9 Requirements on interfaces at different levels of abstractions
The OSA-defined functions may be accessed through interfaces at different
levels of abstractions and according to different programming formalisms, in
addition to those defined in the previous Releases. The abstraction levels and
the programming formalism should be identified according to the needs of the
programmers\' communities. Those interfaces should consist of a simplified
version of the already standardised OSA APIs or consist of new APIs for
additional capabilities defined according to the Web Services principles
(e.g., Parlay X, OMA).
All the interfaces shall be integrated in the context of the OSA architecture:
\- they shall guarantee a secure and controlled access to the service
capabilities;
\- it shall be possible to introduce them in an incremental way;
\- they should allow applications be triggered by network events.
The interfaces shall be defined using state of the art specification
formalisms (e.g., UML, WSDL), and realised using different distributed
processing technologies.
# 10 Security and Privacy requirements
## 10.1 Security requirements on User Profile Management
The User Profile Management functions shall be able to grant or deny access to
individual parts of the subscriber's User Profile.
The User Profile Management functions shall ensure that all operations on
parts of User Profile data are authorized.
The type of access is one out of:
\- Reading user profile information; in case parts of the User profile is
subject for reading it shall unambiguously be identified by the application,
\- Adding information to the user profile,
\- Modify existing information in the user profile.
The control of access rights is in principle on the user\'s discretion. The
user shall have the possibility to allow or restrict the retrieval and
presentation of her user related data. The mechanism how a user is able to
maintain access rights is for further study.
When using the OSA framework to access user profile information, the Generic
User Profile APIs [10] shall be re-used.
## 10.2 Privacy requirements on Subscriber Identity
It shall be possible to hide subscriber's identity towards the OSA
Applications and replace it with an alias. For each OSA Application, the alias
shall be unique identification that has a one-to-one relationship to the
network asserted identity (e.g. MSISDN, IP address, SIP-URI) of the subscriber
and may be permanent or temporary (e.g. session based); those aliases can be
used as parameters in the OSA APIs.
Note: Liberty Alliance and OASIS specifications on Identity Management and
Identity Federation (e.g. SAML 2.0) needs to be taken into account to address
issues related to subscriber identity.
## 10.3 Topology hiding
It shall be possible to hide the topology of the underlying network systems.
It shall be possible to provide a single point of access to the Applications.
# 11 Requirements for Policy Management
Applications shall have the ability to interact with policy-enabled Service
Capability Features in a secure manner. The network policies always take
precedence over the application defined policies.
The OSA interface shall provide sufficient capabilities to enable applications
to request:
  * **To manage the application's policy-related information**
This allows applications to create, modify and delete policies, policy events
and to activate, deactivate and modify policy rules. Policy rules may be
expressed with simple data types (such as integers or string) or more complex
data types (such as Boolean values, time, lists, meta-variables..etc).
Expression of policy rules shall take into account these complex data types as
well as allow for a feature rich set of operands and allow for ability to
define user specific functions.
  * **To manage policy event notification**
This allows applications to register for specific policy events. Once
registered for such events, the application shall receive notification of the
events until it explicitly requests the termination of the notification
request
  * **To collect policy statistics**
This allows an application to collect policy related statistics from the
network. Examples include success or failure of operations on policies and
time stamps of policy events.
  * **To request policy evaluation**
This allows an application to request that a set of policies is evaluated by
the network.
# 12 Event Notification Function
The Event Notification Function shall allow an application to specify the
initial point of contact which it is interested in. The Event Notification
Function provides the necessary mechanisms which enables an application to
request the notification of subscriber or network related event(s). An
application may in addition request the cancellation of subscriber or network
related event notification.
For all subscriber related events the Event Notification Function shall
support two ways for an application to subscribe to notifications: the
application shall either specify the subscriber for which the Event
Notification Function is valid or indicate that it is ready to receive user
related notifications for any subscriber. The application may be responsible
for the explicit provisioning of the subscriber related event notification or
it may leave the provisioning of the notifications to the Home Environment
operator and just indicates that it is ready to receive notifications. An
application may use both mechanisms at the same time. Once an application has
enabled the notification of event(s), the Event Notification Function shall
report the event(s), including the identification of the user to which the
event applies, until such time the application explicitly requests the
termination of the event(s) notification.
When the event occurs, the application that requested the event is informed..
The notification of the event shall be accompanied by unambiguous information
identifying the original request and event related data.. For example, in case
of an application is interested in "message" the notification to the
application shall indicate whether it is incoming or outgoing, in case of
chargeable events, the application shall receive details as used at the
network to create a Call Detail Record. In this case, processing in the
network is not suspended after notification of the event to the application.
The Event Notification Function includes the availability of offering
additional criteria to be specified by the application. The set of criteria is
individual and may vary for the event requested. The detailed set of criteria
available for each of the events below are described in [6].
## 12.1 Subscriber Related events:
â€¢ A call processing event occurs.
when a call to or from a given user changes state and this event is armed by
an application, that application shall be notified.
â€¢ A message is sent or received.
when a message to or from a given user is sent or received and this event is
armed by an application, that application shall be notified.
â€¢ A chargeable event happens.
when a chargeable event occurs for a given user and this event is armed by an
application, that application shall be notified.
â€¢ The userÂ´s status is changed.
when a subscriber registers to a network or when a given user changes her
status (e.g. from idle to busy) and this event is armed by an application,
that application shall be notified. Registration in this sense is further
detailed in the chapter on User Status Functions. Attach and detach applies
for CS and PS.
â€¢ The userÂ´s location is changed.
when a given user changes her location (e.g. leaving a certain area which is
"identifiable" by the network) and this event is armed by an application, that
application shall be notified.
â€¢ The Terminal Capabilities are changed.
when the capabilities of a terminal change (e.g. when a keyboard is attached)
and this event is armed by an application, that application shall be notified.
Note: The ability to support this function is dependent on the ability of a
terminal (through e.g. MExE or WAP) to notify changes in its capabilities.
Therefore this function will _not_ be able to supply event notifications for
terminals not supporting notification of their terminal capabilities.
â€¢ An event occurs which affects the quality of service configured for the
user.
> an application can register with the service for notifications about network
> events that affect the quality of service configured on the end user's
> connection. Whenever such events occur, the service generates notifications
> to inform the application about the impact that these events had on the QoS
> features set up on the end user's connection.
## 12.2 Network Related Events:
â€¢ A network fault management condition is met,
when a fault management condition occurs at the underlying network (e.g.
congestion of network components) and this event is armed by an application,
that application shall be notified.
â€¢ A network service or network service capability registers,
when a network service capability feature registers with the Framework all
applications which have subscribed to this event and are currently authorised
to use this service capability feature shall be notified. In case there is
already a service capability feature of the same type that is in use, all
applications which are authorised and have subscribed to recieve information
about this event will be informed about information related to backward
compatibility between the new service capability feature and the version
currently in use. This information allows an application provider to have an
indication about the effort on his side required in migrating from the older
to the newer version.
â€¢ A network service or network service capability de-registers,
when a network service capability feature de-registers with the Framework all
applications which are currently authorised to use this service capability
feature shall be notified.
## 12.3 Other Related Events:
â€¢ A change in presence related information.
If any presence related information changes (such as one or more presence
information attributes or a user's availability), and this event is armed by
the application, that application shall be notified. Presence information may
be associated with a user, device or service, or any abstract entity that has
the ability to report presence information.
â€¢ A chargeable event happens.
when a chargeable event occurs, which will be charged to the application
provider and this event is armed by an application, that application shall be
notified.
# 13 Functions offered by OSA
Functions that are offered by OSA shall be applicable for a number of
different business and applications domains (including besides the
telecommunication network operators also service provider, third party service
providers acting as HE-VASPs, etc.).
All of these businesses have different requirements, ranging from simple
telephony and call routing, virtual private networks to fully interactive
multimedia to using MS based applications.
**Service Capability Features:**
Application/Clients access OSA functions in terms of service capability
features via the standardised application interface. This means that service
capability features are accessible and visible to application/clients via the
method/operation invocations in the interface.
Service capability features shall be defined as much as possible in a generic
way to hide the network specific implementation. To achieve this, it is
necessary to identify the functionalities that can be provided in different
ways by the use of different service capabilities. For example, User Location
can be produced in several underlying ways.Each of these functionalities can
then be defined as a single generic function and the different underlying
service capabilities are not visible to the application. It is important that
the generic part becomes as large as possible to enable applications to use
functions without the need for knowledge of the underlying network
capabilities
When applications use the generic service capability features, these
applications become independent of the network domain ie network agnostic.
Applications shall however still be able to request service capability
features specific to a service capability (e.g. Call Setup from CAMEL) or
specific to a particular network domain. This will increase dependency of the
application on the used service capability while providing improved
optimisation.
Note: The grouping of OSA functions into Service Capability features is out of
scope of this document.
Three different types of OSA functions can be distinguished:
\- **Framework functions** : provide commonly used utilities, necessary for
access control, security, resilience and management of OSA functions;
**\- Network functions** : these shall enable the applications to make use of
the functionality of the underlying network capabilities.
**\- User Data** related functions: these enable applications to access data
of a particular user. Such data are e.g. the status of the user, her location
or data in the user's User Profile.
## 13.1 The Framework functions
The framework provides the essential capabilities that allow OSA applications
to make use of the service capabilities in the network. The framework shall
support the ability for applications to access SCFs in another network.
There are four distinct features that comprise the framework: _Trust and
Security Management, Service_ _Registration and Discovery functions,_
_Integrity Management and Service Subscription_.
### 13.1.1 Trust and Security Management
The trust and security management feature provides the necessary mechanisms
which define the security parameters in which client applications may access
the network. This includes the availability of a framework initial access
point through which all client applications are authenticated and authorised
and the ability to allow the signing of on-line service level agreements
between the client applications and the framework.
#### 13.1.1.1 Authentication
Authentication is used to verify the identity of an entity (user, network, and
application).
Three types of authentication are distinguished:
  * User-Network Authentication:
Before a user can access her subscribed applications, the user has to be
authenticated by the network that provides access to the application. This
allows the network to check to what applications the user has subscribed to.
User-network authentication _is handled within the network and therefore
outside the scope of the OSA_ .
  * Application-Network Authentication:
Before an application can use the capabilities from the network, a service
agreement has to be established between the application and the network.
Establishment of such a service agreement starts with the mutual
authentication between application and network. If a service agreement already
exists, modification might be needed or a new agreement might supersede the
existing.
  * User-Application Authentication:
Before a user can use an application or perform other activities (e.g.
modifying profile data) the application must authenticate the user. When the
network already authenticates the user, authentication is not needed anymore.
When the network is transparent and the user accesses an application directly,
authentication is needed between user and application. This is outside the
scope of the OSA.
#### 13.1.1.2 Authorisation
Authorisation is the activity of determining what an authenticated entity
(user, network, and application) is allowed to do.
NOTE: Authentication must therefore precede authorisation.
Two types of authorisation are distinguished:
  * Application-Network Authorisation:
Verifies what non-framework functions the application is allowed to use. Once
an application has been authorised to use one, more or all non-framework
functions no further authorisation is required as long as the \"allowed\" non-
framework functions are used.
  * User-Application Authorisation:
The application verifies what actions the user is allowed to perform (e.g.
deactivation of functionality, modification of application data). This is
transparent to the network and therefore outside the scope of the present
document.
#### 13.1.1.3 Policy for service capability features access and usage
The framework shall provide functions to manage and enforce policies on the
access and usage of service capability features requested by the OSA
Applications, in addition to the policies implemented by the Service
Capability Features themselves (e.g. through policy-enabled Service Capability
Features). Examples of such policies are: number of application requests for a
specified period, frequency of application requests, check on syntax
correctness and validity in term of lifetime for parameters, check if the
requestor (OSA Application and/or subscriber) is in arrears.
### 13.1.2 Service Registration feature
The Registration function enables the non-framework service capability
features (i.e. service capability features that contain non-Framework
functions) to register with the Framework. Registration must take place before
authorised applications can find out from the Framework which non-framework
service capability features are available. This means that the non-framework
service capability features must be registered before they can be discovered
and used by authorised applications. The service capability feature is finally
registered if the registration process is successfully completed.
Note that only the non-framework service capability features have to be
registered. The Framework service capability features (containing only
Framework functions) are available by default since they provide basic
mechanisms.
### 13.1.3 Service De-Registration function
The De-Registration function enables the non-framework service capability
features (i.e. service capability features that contain non-Framework
functions) to de-register with the Framework. When a service capability
feature de-registers the service capability feature shall discontinue
providing service to all applications. Further, the service capability feature
can no longer be discovered.
### 13.1.4 Service Discovery feature
The Discovery function enables the application to identify the total
collection of service capability features that it can use. Upon request of the
application, the Discovery function indicates the non-framework service
capability features that are available for use by the application. The list of
available service capability features is created through the Registration
process described in subclause 12.1.2. This means that a service capability
feature must be registered at the Framework before it can be discovered by the
application.
### 13.1.5 Integrity Management function
Integrity management provides the means to allow the framework to query and
report conditions that relate to the integrity of the framework, the network
service capability features and the client applications. Furthermore an
application may query conditions that relate to the integrity of the framework
ad the network service capability features and report on it's own conditions.
As part of the integrity management functions, the framework may provide:
  * supervision of the status of client applications to ensure continued operation, a process known as heartbeating.
  * fault management reporting and control. Specific examples include the ability for the framework to notify applications of internal fault conditions as well as faults in the network service capability features and the ability for applications to request specific test executions in the framework.
  * operations and maintenance access, more specifically, the ability for the application to synchronise with the system date and time.
### 13.1.5a Service Subscription function
This function represents a contractual agreement between an Enterprise
Operator and the Framework. In this subscription business model, an enterprise
operator fulfils the role of subscriber/customer of services and the client
applications act in the role of users or consumers of services. The framework
itself acts in the role of retailer of services.
### 13.1.6 APIs Usage Accounting
The framework shall provide functions to supply information for accounting of
the usage of APIs.
### 13.1.7 Support for Identity Management Framework
The Parlay OSA framework shall provide support for Identity Management. This
shall take into account frameworks such as Liberty Alliance identity
management framework.
## 13.2 Network functions
The Network functions represent the total collection of network resources.\
The following subclauses define generic network functions e.g. for Message
Transfer.
### 13.2.1 Call and Session Control functions
This subclause details with Call and Session Control functions. The purpose of
this function is to allow applications to control and monitor calls, packet
switched sessions and IM Sessions.
The application may request the quality of service when first negotiated at
the start of the call and may also request the network to notify the
application of any changes in QoS (conversational, background, interactive and
streaming class - see [4]) which take place during the call.
For QoS information, the Call and Session Control Functions allow applications
to monitor the amount of used traffic channels and bandwidth (e.g. for HSCSD)
and used timeslots (e.g. for GPRS).
#### 13.2.1.1 CS Call Control functions
This subclause details with circuit switched call control functions. The
purpose of this function is to allow applications to control and monitor
calls.
Applications should have the ability to :
  * Release Calls:
This provides the ability for the application to force the release of a call.
The application may provide an indication of the reason for release of the
call.
  * Control Calls:
This provides the ability for an application to modify the information
pertaining to the call at the time of establishment of the call. The
application may also allow the call to continue with or without the modified
information pertaining to the call. The application shall have the ability to
request call events of the call under control to be observed by the network
and reported back to the application.
  * Request call information:
This provides the ability for an application to request information relating
to the call of interest specified in advance. Requested information includes
at least call duration, call end time.
  * Monitor calls:
This provides the ability for an application to monitor for call duration and
tariff switching moments. An application may specify a threshold for the
duration of a call or a part thereof. The application shall have the ability
to grant new thresholds when the expiry of a previously set threshold has been
reported to the application. When an event is subject to be monitored and the
event is met, the application shall get informed accompanied with sufficient
information.
  * Presentation of, or restriction of, information associated with a party involved in a call (e.g. calling line ID, calling name);
  * Relinquish control over a call
This allows an application to relinquish control over a call but still
allowing the established call to continue. Once the control of the call has
been relinquished, the application may not be able to regain control over that
call.
  * Interact with a user
This provides the ability for an application to interact with a user. An
application may be able to send specific information to the user and may
request the collection of data from the user. Sending information to the user
or collecting information from the user shall be supported when the user is
engaged in a call (e.g. USSD, DTMF) or call-unrelated (e.g. USSD, SMS). The
information sent to the user may include an indication of an announcement,
text or user specific data.
Note 1: Call related user interaction may e.g. be used to
play/record/customise user specific announcements while through call-unrelated
user interaction e.g. service preferences may be managed.
For each call it shall be possible to specify:
  * the events on which monitoring is required ([10]).
Note 2: The mapping to service capabilities is for further study (it shall be
investigated to which extend the requirements above fit to CAMEL, MEXE and
other service capabilities).

to grant new thresholds when the expiry of a previously set threshold has been
reported to the application.
#### 13.2.1.3 IM Session Control functions
**IM Session Control**
**Create IM Sessions\** The application shall be able to establish IM sessions
between two or more parties with certain media capabilities. The application
may add or remove parties at any time for any session. An application may add
additional sessions with certain media capabilities between any parties
already involved in an session. Sessions with multiple parties may lead to the
creation of a multi-media Conference Call. This can either be an ad-hoc
conference creation or it can refer to resources that were reserved in
advance.
**Release IM Sessions\** This provides the ability for an application to force
the release of an IM session. This may be limited to the release of certain
parties from the session or may be the release of all the parties.
**Relinquish control over an IM session\** This allows an application to
relinquish control over IM sessions.
**Party join/leave control** \ The application shall be informed when a new
call party wants to join/leave the conference. It shall be possible for the

### 13.2.4 Charging functions
Call and Event Charging
Call and Event Charging functions enable the application to instruct the
network and inform the user with charging information and to add some
additional charging information to the network generated Call Detail Records.
Some of the following charging facilities are available only if the network
either controls the account or has access to it.
The OSA Call and Event Charging function shall enable an application to:
\- define and manage thresholds (e.g. session duration, data volume) for a
call;
\- provide additional charging information to be included in the Call Detail
Record. This may contain information transparent to the network;
\- transfer Advice of Charge data (as defined in [5]) to the terminal.
Service Usage
These charging functions shall enable applications to augment subscriber
accounts maintained by the network and to charge subscribers for using
services. These applications are not necessarily telecommunication related. In
addition to charging subscribers for service usage, these functions could also
be used for payments in an online purchase scenario.
Provided, that these functions are supported by the underlying network an
application shall be able to:
\- Check, if -- for the service to be provided by the application -- the
charge is covered by the subscribers account or credit limit
\- Reserve -- for the service to be provided by the application -- a charge in
the subscribers account, that can be deduced from the account after service
delivery.
\- Deduct an amount from the subscriber's account. If a reservation has been
made earlier, this amount should be taken from the reserved amount.
\- Request the network to split the deduction of an amount among several
subscribers accounts or other chargeable entities according to a specified
partitioning. It shall be possible to notify an individual subscriber\'s
account or other chargeable entity about the percentage of the total amount,
to which the deduction has been performed\ Note: this requirement also covers
the case when the total amount to be deduced is calculated by the network.
\- Release a reservation acquired earlier. If part of a reservation has been
deducted already, just release the remaining reservation.
\- Add non-monetary units to a subscriber's account.
\- Deduct non-monetary units from a subscriber's account.
> \- Reverse a completed charge transaction, e.g. after repudiation.
The functions for charging application usage shall meet the following general
requirements:
\- Hide payment policy (e.g. prepaid/postpaid) from applications
\- Hide payment type (credit card, cash, bank withdrawal) from applications
\- Hide subscriber's identity towards the application. This would provide
anonymity (like for prepaid customers).
\- Support prepaid subscribers. This requires that the application immediately
gets informed if the subscriber's account covers the service usage costs. If
not, the application may reject serving the subscriber.
\- Allow for Multi-currency support. This shall allow service providers to
request charging in their preferred currency
General Account functions
These functions provide access to sensitive data. They shall be restricted to
client applications that had been granted additional privileges via suitable
means, i.e. as authorised by the framework function.
The OSA general Account function shall enable an application to:
\- retrieve a transaction history of a subscriber's account, this may include
\- the retrieval of a list of monetary or non-monetary amounts that have been
debited from or credited to a subscribers online account,
\- the request of additional information on the specific transaction (e.g. the
application or service description provided with the actual transaction).
\- check a subscriber's current account balance.
\- monitor the subscribers account and may request to get informed of any
change.
\- ask the charged user for an explicit, interactive confirmation before any
charging operation is performed. The General Account function will support a
procedure to obtain confirmation by the user. Such a procedure shall be under
the control of the network.
Note: There is no requirement to standardise this procedure.
In case an application retrieves a list for a subscribers' transaction
history, it shall specify the time interval for which the transaction history
shall be retrieved.

end user's connection on a temporary basis
â€¢ Applications are able to view transaction history and current quality of
service status for reasons such as self-care.
QoS features are defined within the network and may be managed and shared
beforehand with application providers, with a clear indication as to which of
these can be used as default QoS features and temporary QoS features.
13.2.7 Service Request Capabilities
The application shall have the ability to request a particular type of
service, for example CS-video, or IP-voice, or Communication Service. If an
application requests a particular type of service, the underlying network has
the right to reject such a request and instead offer a default service. The
application shall have to ability to receive notifications and events related
to the service running in the underlying network.
## 13.3 User data related functions
### 13.3.1 User Status functions

optional requestor identiy, an optional service identity and an optional
codeword (as defined in [9]). If an application provides one or more of the
above optinal privacy information, the information shall be brought to the
location service capabilities attention and used to comply with privacy
policies of the subscriber the request relates to.
### 13.3.3 Void
### 13.3.4 Void
### 13.3.5 Terminal Capabilities functions
The Terminal Capabilities functions enable the application to determine the
capabilities of the user\'s terminal .
Note 1: The ability to support this function is dependent on the ability of a
terminal (through e.g. MExE or WAP) to notify its terminal capabilities.
Therefore this function will _not_ be able to supply terminal capabilities for
terminals not supporting notification of their terminal capabilities.

## 13.5 Presence related capability functions
### 13.5.1 Relationship to Release 6 Presence Service
Void.
### 13.5.2 Functions
The OSA interface shall allow an application access to presence capabilities
within the network. Presence related information may be requested or supplied
by an OSA application and may include, but not limited to presence information
pertaining to the presence service as described in [7] or user availability.
An OSA application may act as a requester of presence information (i.e. act as
a watcher) and/or act as a supplier of presence information (i.e. act as a
presentity). All the capabilities offered to presence service watchers and
presentities are described in [7] and may be offered to OSA applications. In
addition to the authorisation performed by the OSA Framework, the presence
service checks that the application is permitted to access the presence
service.
An OSA application may manage or query availability status and/or preferences
of a user which may be associated with one or more services (e.g. voice call,
IMS sessions, MMS ...etc.). Such availability may be determined from a range
of existing capabilities.
The following OSA capabilities shall be supported for an application:
**\- register as a presentity and/or watcher:**

# 14 Service Brokering Function
OSA Service Brokering support requires API level capabilities like Service
Selection, Service Provisioning, Feature Interaction and Service Chaining. The
concept of Service brokering in this context is the ability to package,
provision and supply a set of applications or services onwards to the
application server implementing the business logic that requires the use of
such a service broker functionality within an OSA environment.
Service broker function shall enable the delivery of multiple services in an
operator network in a managed and controlled fashion. Therefore whenever an
event occurs, there is a need to ensure that the set of applications or
services that may act upon that event are invoked in a manner that does not
conflict with any other application or service defined in the provisioned
package of applications or services.
OSA Service Brokering API should be capable of supporting the following
features;
\- Provisioning and Management of all data necessary to support OSA service
brokering
\- Evaluation of OSA service brokering data to control execution of service
scenarios
_\- Service Brokering should support OSA SCS Service Brokering and OSA
Application Service Brokering._
Note 1: Examples where an OSA service brokering solution may apply include:
> \- A network event such as a call trigger may result in the need to resolve
> conflicts between different OSA applications and related service delivery
> platforms.
>
> \- An OSA SCS may receive or generate an event that requires the use of
> further OSA SCSs, for example Policy Management, Charging etc., transparent
> to the application using the SCS.
>
> \- An OSA SCS may generate an event that may result in the need to resolve
> conflicts between multiple OSA applications.
Note 2: Requirements for the service brokering between OSA and non-OSA
applications are FFS.
###### ## Annex A (informative) : Use cases
This informative annex describes how the OSA functions described in the
normative section of this document could be used to deploy enhanced multimedia
services.
## A.1 Travel support and information service
[Service Scenario Description]{.underline}
The service scenario described below is the following: a user has subscribed
to a tourist board information service, and each time he will enter a new
interesting location the service provider will offer him to watch a video
showing the main attractions of the area. The service is charged 1 Euro per
movie.
[Step by step description]{.underline}
Note: The following description does not imply any physical location of the
different functions, or any mapping between the SCFs and the network
capabilities. The processes internal to the different entities are not
detailed.
FF: Framework Function
NF: Network Function
UF: User data related Functions
**Step 1: On-line Service Level Agreement**
This step is intended to sign an on-line service level agreement (SLA) between
the information service and the framework.
{width="3.0520833333333335in" height="1.8041666666666667in"}
**Step 2: Service initialisation**
The Service Provider will discover all the service features available in the
network (e.g. location update, service usage charging...), and set up the
parameters necessary to render the service (i.e. the service provider asks to
be notified whenever the user enters a specific geographic area). The list of
available service features depends on the SLA.
Note: It is assumed that all the available Service Capability Features have
already registered.
**Step 3: Service Delivery**
The service provider is informed that the user has entered a new geographical
area (e.g. Japan). After checking that the user has enough money left on his
account, the service provider retrieves the terminal capabilities. Based on
this information, the service provider can determine the type of content that
can be sent to the user (for example a black and white video if the terminal
does not support colour display,...). The service provider will then reserve 1
â‚¬ in the account of the subscriber. A multimedia session will be established
between the service provider and the user, and the user will then be displayed
the sightseeing information. Once the movie's display is over, the session
will be released and the service fee will be deducted from the user's account.
## A.2 Void
## A.3 Access to SCFs in another network
[Service Scenario Description]{.underline}
Two operators, a wireline operator A and a wireless operator B, belonging to
the same telecommunication group, have adopted OSA solutions. Each of them
introduced in its service platform an OSA Gateway, to provide to application
layers (also in 3rd party domains) a relevant subset of capabilities
implemented in its network.
Let assume that a corporate is implementing a rich VPN-like service by
exploiting the features provided by the wireline operator (i.e., the corporate
subscribed a subset of the SCFs provided by wireline operator). If such a
corporate wants to enhance its application with the capability to handle with
SMSs sent/received by the members of its VPN (e.g., its employees) and the
wireline operator does not provide any appropriate network capabilities,
according to the current specifications, the corporate must subscribe the
needed SCF (e.g., a User Interaction implemented through SMSs) provided by
another operator (e.g., the wireless operator B). But in this case, the
corporate must deal with two subscriptions, its VPN application must cope with
two OSA Gateways; in addition, the corporate could select a different wireless
operator, not belonging to the same group of the operator A.
Figure 4: Operator A and Operator B relationship
Such a situation could be dealt by enhancing the OSA specifications in order
to allow the OSA Gateways belonging to A and B to be "federated", in order to
allow the subscribers to the OSA Gateway in A to access also, in a controlled
way, the service capabilities provided by the OSA Gateway in B. This means
that the applications do not have to deal with the complexity of handling two
OSA Gateways, the application service provider does not have to open a new
customer relationship with another operator, and the operator A has not to
introduce additional service capabilities in its infrastructure.
