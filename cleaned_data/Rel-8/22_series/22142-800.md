# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
[1] and the following apply:
**Short Message Forwarding:** The service permits the network to send all
incoming short messages addressed to the called mobile subscriber\'s directory
number to another directory number.
**Short Message Filtering:** The service permits the network to filter certain
short messages on behalf of a called/calling party based on the called/calling
party's preferences.
**Short Message Receipt:** The service permits the network to send one or more
receipts to inform a calling party the status of sent message.
**Short Message Network Storage:** The service permits the network to help the
subscriber store messages that the subscriber has sent or received.
**SMS VPN service: Enables the exchange of SMS messages between VPN (Virtual
Private Network) members by using a short number, usually similar to the
receiver fixed extension number, instead of using the full mobile number of
the recipient.**
**SMS Auto Reply:** **The SMS Auto Reply service enables the subscriber to
activate an automatic SMS reply in response to incoming SMS messages, both
from in network subscribers as well as from foreign networks subscribers
(incoming MT messages from foreign networks).**
**SMS Personal Signature** : The service **allows the end user to personalize
its outgoing messages either with a personal remark or a business title. The
service enables a user to pre-define a text that will automatically be added
to all outgoing SMS messages.**
**SMS Deferred Delivery** : The SMS deferred delivery service provides a
subscriber the capability to control the actual delivery time of messages
created by him. User using this capability can send a message and configure it
to be delivered at a later time.

# 4 Requirements
## 4.1 High Level Requirements
The VAS-SMS shall be implemented without influencing the existing SMS service.
The VAS-SMS shall be implemented without depending on the terminal's
capability.
Users shall be able to register, activate, deactivate, withdraw and
reconfigure VAS-SMS via the UE, or web portals.
The VAS-SMS shall be designed and implemented in a way to provide users who
joined the services one coherent and identical user experience, regardless of
the SM flow and SM scenario (e.g. messages to and from applications, MO-MT in
an in network and MT from Foreign Network).
## 4.2 Overall Service Requirements
### 4.2.1 Management of Service Information
#### 4.2.1.1 Capabilities provided to the user
The VAS-SMS shall be able to support a request from an application to
query/change the choice of services for a subscriber.
The VAS-SMS shall be able to support a request from an application to
query/change the subscriber's preferences for a certain service, for example:
i) To add or delete or modify a subscriber's filtering conditions by which
VAS-SMS can refuse some of the subscriber's incoming messages.
ii) To modify a subscriber's signature that will be appended to an SM sent
from the subscriber.
**iii)** To modify a subscriber's forwarding address that substitutes for the
subscriber's original receiving address.
#### 4.2.1.2 Capabilities provided to the network
The VAS-SMS shall be able to support a request to query/change the
subscriber's information, for example:
i) To get the detail information about the subscriber's service.
ii) To add or delete a subscriber's service information.
The VAS-SMS shall be able to support a request to query the handling results
of the subscription service.
#### 4.2.1.3 Capabilities provided to authorized third party
The VAS-SMS shall be able to support a request from an application to modify
the contents that will be appended to an SM, for example:
i) to load or unload a particular content provided by the third party
ii) to associate a content with a particular subscriber or a type of
subscribers
iii) to define the trigger for inclusion or change of such content
Note: The management of VAS4SMS service is out of scope of 3GPP
standardisation.
### 4.2.2 Short Message processing
The VAS-SMS should be able to deal with the content of an SM, for example:
i) To insert content (as agreed with the subscriber, or as agreed with a third
party and authorized by the subscriber) into the original SM and form a new SM
(e.g. append the signature to the SM, append the content as provided by the
third party, ...).
ii) To compile an SM by containing operator's information (e.g. construct a
delivery report).
**iii)** To use certain words in an SM as the filtering criteria.
The VAS-SMS should be able to convert the format of an SM into other formats
(e.g. email, WAP message, etc).
### 4.2.3 Short Message Forwarding
It shall be supported that users can set certain conditions (e.g., different
time periods) for message forwarding. There are no significant delays to any
part of the service.
With the advent of SM forwarding there is also the issue of how to handle the
situation when a user by mistake sets forwarding to wrong number (a number
that is in use). Ideally a recipient should be capable of stopping the
delivery of such SM to its own address. As a minimum the recipient's operator
should be capable of identifying forwarded SM and stop delivery. Infinite
forwarding loops needs to be prevented.
SM Forwarding service should support forwarding to numbers of both the
operator as well as other operators.
It shall be possible to Notify a recipient upon activation of the service and
only upon his approval activate the service for the user.
There may be no relation between SM Forwarding service and Voice Call
Forwarding service.
### 4.2.4 Short Message Forwarding multiple subscriptions
It may be supported that an operator can set a group of subscriptions for
which SM are forwarded to the active/last activated subscription of that
group, under the condition that the delivery address of the SM is associated
to a subscription of that group and that address is not registered on the
network.
### 4.2.5 Short Message filtering
It shall be supported that users can set certain conditions for message
filtering.
### 4.2.6 Short Message receipt

additional receipt SM for different callers, so the standard Status Report may
be accompanied by a newly generated SM with the content provided by the
operator.
### 4.2.7 Short Message Network Storage
It should be possible for the operator to support Short Message Network
Storage to allow users to store the messages in the network.
It should be possible for users to store the messages in the network based on
their personal settings (e.g. store all sent & received messages, store the
messages from/to particular users, store the messages sent & received in a
specified period of time etc).
It should be possible for users to store and manage the messages for their
preference (e.g. users can set different folders to store different sort of
messages, therefore it is convenient to inquire the stored messages based on
message sort or key words).
It should be possible for the operator to ensure all relevant information of
the messages stored in the network are consistent with that displayed to
users, e.g. content of the messages, sender/recipient, sending/receiving time,
etc.
It shall be supported that user can pre-set certain conditions for storage.
The storage condition includes all sent messages, all received messages,
messages sent to or received from one or more special phone numbers and so on.
It should be possible for the operator to prevent storage of configuration SM,
notifications (e.g. voice mail, SM delivery notifications).
It shall be supported that users can transfer the messages stored in the
message depository to any other mobile phone.
It shall be supported that users can inquire the messages stored in the
message depository according to certain query conditions (e.g., short message
receiver, short message sender, key words etc.).
It shall be supported that users can manage the stored messages via a website,
and it shall be possible for the user to set access right for other users (
e.g. read only , read and download etc), in this way, other users are able to
inquire his stored messages through a link to the website after valid
authentication.
In case of multiple delivery attempts SM will be copied only once regardless
of the number of delivery attempts.
It shall be possible to combine concatenated SM to single Message in the
Network store or alternatively indicate in the message that it is part of
concatenated SM.
The Short Message Network Storage service shall prevent duplicate storage
message as a result of failure in transmission of the original SM.
Messages should be stored in the Network Storage regardless of the user
availability and as soon as the original SM is being processed in the SMSC.
### 4.2.8 Short Message to multiple destinations
It shall be able to support inclusion of multiple recipients in a message when
a user sends a single message to multiple individuals.
It should be possible for all recipients of the message to be aware of other
recipients.
It should be possible for a recipient to choose to whom the reply message is
sent, i.e. to the original sender and to other recipients of the original
message.
It shall be supported that a user can include multiple destination addresses
in a message. The recipient except those addresses displaying information is
blocked shall receive information on all recipients of the message.
It shall be supported that each recipient of the message can send a message
back to all recipients of the original message.

destinations). There shall be no significant delays to any part of the
service.
### 4.2.12 Short Message Deferred Delivery
The SM Deferred delivery shall support the following delivery time options:
\- Relative timing -- The text will include information as for the of how many
more days, hours, minutes shall pass before the message shall be delivered.
\- Absolute timing - The text will include information indicating of the
specific Date and Time for the message to be delivered
