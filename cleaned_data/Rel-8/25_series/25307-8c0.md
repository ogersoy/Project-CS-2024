# 3A General
TSG-RAN has agreed that the standardisation of new frequency bands may be
independent of a release. However, in order to implement a UE that conforms to
a particular release but supports a band of operation that is specified in a
later release, it is necessary to specify some extra requirements.
For example, Band III is contained in the Release 5 specifications. In order
to implement a UE conforming to Release 4 but supporting Band III, it is
necessary for the UE to additionally conform to some parts of the Release 5
specifications, such as the radio frequency requirements for the Band III and
some signalling extensions relating to the UE radio access capabilities.
NOTE: See NOTE in clause 4.4 in [30] or [31].
