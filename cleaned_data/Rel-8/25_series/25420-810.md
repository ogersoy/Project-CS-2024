# 4 General Aspects
## 4.1 Introduction
The logical connection that exists between any two RNCs within the UTRAN is
referred to as the Iur interface.
## 4.2 Iur Interface General Principles
The general principles for the specification of the Iur interface are as
follows:
\- The Iur interface should be open;
\- The Iur interface shall support the exchange of signalling information
between two RNCs, in addition the interface may need to support one or more
Iur data streams;
\- From a logical standpoint, the Iur is a point-to-point interface between
two RNCs within the UTRAN. A point-to-point logical interface should be
feasible even in the absence of a physical direct connection between the two
RNCs.
## 4.3 Iur Interface Specification Objectives
### 4.3.1 General
The I~ur~ interface specifications shall facilitate the following:
\- inter-connection of RNCs supplied by different manufacturers;
\- support of continuation between RNSs of the UTRAN services offered via the
Iu interface;
\- separation of I~ur~ interface Radio Network functionality and Transport
Network functionality to facilitate introduction of future technology.
### 4.3.2 Addressing of RNSs over the Iur Interface
\- For an RRC connection using a dedicated channel or for a UE using F-DPCH in
the downlink, the Iur standard shall allow the addition / deletion of radio
links supported by cells belonging to any RNS within the PLMN.
\- The specification of the Iur interface shall allow an RNC to address any
other RNC within the PLMN for establishing a signalling bearer over Iur.
\- The specification of the Iur interface shall allow an RNC to address any
other RNC within the PLMN for establishing user data bearers for Iur data
streams.
RNSAP shall allow different kinds of addressing schemes to be used for the
signalling bearer.
## 4.4 Iur Interface Capabilities
### 4.4.1 Radio application related signalling
The Iur interface provides capability to support radio interface mobility
between RNSs, of UEs having a connection with UTRAN. This capability includes
the support of handover, radio resource handling, MBMS handling and
synchronisation between RNSs.
### 4.4.2 Iub/Iur DCH data streams
The Iur interface provides the means for transport of uplink and downlink
Iub/Iur DCH frames carrying user data and control information between SRNC and
Node B (DRNS), via the DRNC.
In the UTRAN, one DCH data stream always corresponds to a bi-directional
transport channel. Although the TFS is configured separately for each DCH
direction and a DCH could be configured with e.g. only a zero-bit transport
format in one direction, the DCH is always treated as a bi-directional
transport channel in the UTRAN. As a result, two uni-directional Uu DCH
transport channels with opposite directions can be mapped to either one or two
DCH transport channels in the UTRAN.
### 4.4.3 Iur RACH data streams
The Iur interface provides the means for transport of uplink RACH transport
frames between DRNC and SRNC.
### 4.4.4 Iur DSCH data streams [TDD]
An Iur DSCH data stream corresponds to the data carried on one DSCH transport
channel for one UE. A UE may have multiple Iur DSCH data streams.
The Iur interface provides a means of transporting down link MAC-c/sh SDUs. In
addition, the interface provides a means to the SRNC for queue reporting and a
means for the DRNC to allocate capacity to the SRNC.
### 4.4.5 Iur USCH data streams [TDD]
An Iur USCH data stream corresponds to the data carried on one USCH transport
channel for one UE. A UE may have multiple Iur USCH data streams.
### 4.4.6 Iur FACH data streams
The Iur interface provides the means for transport of downlink FACH transport
frames between SRNC and DRNC.
### 4.4.7 Iur HS-DSCH data streams
An Iur HS-DSCH data stream corresponds to the data carried on one MAC-d flow
for one UE. A UE may have multiple Iur HS-DSCH data streams.
The Iur interface provides a means of transporting down link MAC-d PDUs. In
addition, the interface provides a means to the SRNC for queue reporting and a
means for the DRNC to allocate capacity to the SRNC.
### 4.4.8 Iub/Iur E-DCH data streams
The Iur interface provides the means for transport of Iub/Iur E-DCH frames
carrying user data between NodeB (DRNS) and SRNC, via the DRNC.
An Iur E-DCH data stream corresponds to the data carried on one MAC-d flow for
one UE. A UE may have multiple E-DCH data streams. In addition, the interface
provides the following:
\- A means for the Node B to indicate the number of HARQ retransmissions to
the SRNC [11];
\- A means to indicate to the SRNC, for the purposes of re-ordering, the CFN
and Subframe Number that have been added by the Node B in the DRNS[1].
## 4.5 Iur Interface Characteristics
### 4.5.1 Uses of SCCP
#### 4.5.1.1 General
The SCCP is used to support signalling messages between two RNCs. One user
function of the SCCP, called Radio Network Subsystem Application Part (RNSAP),
is defined. The RNSAP uses one signalling connection per DRNC and UE where a
UE is having one or more active radio links for the transfer of layer 3
messages. RNSAP also uses one signalling connection per RNC providing common
measurements and information to a particular RNC (i.e. if measurements and
information are transferred in both directions between a pair of RNCs, then
two SCCP connections are used).
Both connectionless and connection-oriented procedures are used to support the
RNSAP. TS 25.423 explain whether connection oriented or connectionless
services should be used for a layer 3 procedure.
The following subclauses describe the use of SCCP connections for RNSAP
transactions. Subclause 4.5.1.2 describes the connection establishment
procedures. Subclause 4.5.1.3 describes the connection establishment
procedures initiated from SRNC. Subclause 4.5.1.4 describes the connection
release procedures. Subclause 4.5.1.5 describes abnormal conditions.
#### 4.5.1.2 SCCP connection establishment
A new SCCP connection is established when information related to the
communication between a UE and the network has to be exchanged between two
RNCs, and no SCCP connection exists between the two RNCs involved, for the
concerned UE.
In this case, the SCCP connection is established by the SRNC.
A new SCCP connection is established when a request for common measurements or
information is made towards a particular RNC and no SCCP connection for common
measurements and information transfer has been established from the RNC
requesting the measurements or information towards the one providing the
measurements or the information.
In this case, the SCCP connection is established by the RNC requesting the
measurements or the information.
#### 4.5.1.3 Establishment procedure initiated from the SRNC
The SCCP signalling connection establishment is initiated, by the SRNC, when
the SRNC needs to request dedicated resources, i.e. a DCH, from a DRNC.
**Initiation**
\- The SRNC sends the SCCP: CR message to the DRNC. The RADIO LINK SETUP
REQUEST message or the ENHANCED RELOCATION REQUEST may be included in the user
data field of an SCCP Connection Request message.
**Termination**
1\. Successful outcome:
\- The SCCP Connection Confirm message, which may optionally contain a
connection oriented RNSAP message in the user data field, is returned to the
SRNC.
2\. Unsuccessful outcome:
\- If the SCCP signalling connection establishment fails, an SCCP Connection
Refusal message will be sent back to the SRNC. This message may optionally
contain a connection oriented RNSAP message.
For more information on how the RNSAP procedures Radio Link Setup and Enhanced
Relocation are handled, please see the procedures Radio Link Setup and
Enhanced Relocation in TS 25.423 [5].
Figure 1: Setting-up of SCCP Signalling Connection
#### 4.5.1.3A Establishment procedure initiated from an RNC requesting common
measurements or information
The SCCP signalling connection establishment is initiated, by an RNC, when the
RNC needs to request common measurements or provision of information from
another RNC and there is no signalling bearer existing for this purpose. For
the description below, the RNC requesting the measurements or the information
is called RNC1 and the RNC being requested to provide the measurements or the
information is called RNC2.
**Initiation**
\- The RNC1 sends the SCCP: CR message to the RNC2. The COMMON MEASUREMENT
INITIATION REQUEST or the INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION REQUEST message
shall be included in the user data field of the SCCP Connection Request
message.
**Termination**
1\. Successful outcome:
\- The SCCP Connection Confirm message, which may optionally contain a
connection oriented RNSAP message in the user data field, is returned to the
RNC1.
2\. Unsuccessful outcome:
\- If the SCCP signalling connection establishment fails, an SCCP Connection
Refusal message will be sent back to the RNC1. This message may optionally
contain a connection oriented RNSAP message.
RNSAP Common Measurement Initiation and Information Exchange Initiation
procedures are described in [5].
Figure 1a: Setting-up of SCCP Signalling Connection
#### 4.5.1.4 SCCP connection release
An SCCP connection related to a specific UE is released in all normal release
cases when the RNC which established the SCCP connection realises that a given
signalling connection is no longer required.
The RNC which established SCCP connection sends an SCCP Released message.
The procedure may be initiated at the SRNC side and the DRNC side in any
abnormal release case.
An SCCP connection used for common measurements and information exchanges is
released in all normal release cases when the RNC1 (see 4.5.1.3A) determines
that a given signalling connection is no longer required. The RNC1 sends an
SCCP Released message.
In case an SCCP Release message is received after the successful completion of
an SRNC Relocation procedure while dedicated resources are still allocated the
new SRNC shall only release the SCCP connection and the Iur related dedicated
resource.
The procedure may be initiated at the RNC 1 side and the RNC 2 side in any
abnormal release case.
#### 4.5.1.5 General SCCP Abnormal Conditions
##### 4.5.1.5.1 SCCP bearer failure
If a user-out-of-service information or signalling-point-inaccessible
information is received by the RNSAP, no new attempt to establish SCCP
connections or to send SCCP Connectionless messages towards the affected
signalling point (indicated by the affected signalling point code) will be
started until the corresponding user-in-service information or signalling-
point-accessible information is received.
When a user-out-of-service information or signalling-point-inaccessible is
received by an RNC, an optional timer may be started. When the timer expires,
the RNC shall take actions as described in [5] Annex D.1.1. When the user-in-
service or signalling-point-accessible is received, the timer is stopped.
##### 4.5.1.5.2 SCCP connection failure
If for any reason an SCCP connection is released, the optional timer expires
or a connection refusal is received while any of the RNSAP procedures are
being performed or while a dedicated resource is still allocated, this shall
be handled by the RNC as described in [5] Annex D.1.2.
### 4.5.2 SCCP Addressing Scheme
#### 4.5.2.1 General
RNSAP may use SSN, SPC and/or GT and any combination of them as addressing
schemes for the SCCP. Which of the available addressing schemes to use for the
SCCP is an operator matter.
When GT addressing is utilised, the following settings shall be used:
\- SSN Indicator = 1 (RNSAP SSN as defined in [13] shall always be included);
\- Global Title Indicator = 0100 (GT includes translation type, numbering
plan, encoding scheme and nature of address indicator);
\- Translation Type = 0000 0000 (not used);
\- Numbering Plan = 0001 (E.163/4);
\- Nature of Address Indicator = 000 0100 (International Significant Number);
\- Encoding Scheme = 0001 or 0010 (BCD, odd or even);
\- Routing indicator = 0 or 1 (route on GT or PC/SSN).
When used, the GT shall be the E.164 address of the relevant node.

>
> \- MBMS UE Linking/De-linking
>
> \- MBMS URA linking/De-linking
\- MBMS Channel type Indication
\- MBSFN MCCH Information Control
## 5.2 Functional Split over Iur
### 5.2.1 Combining/Splitting
DRNS may perform combining/splitting of data streams communicated via its
cells. SRNS performs combining/splitting of Iur data streams received
from/sent to DRNS(s), and data streams communicated via its own cells.
The UL combining of information streams may be performed using any suitable
algorithm, for example:
\- [FDD - based on maximum ratio algorithm (maximum ratio combining)];
\- [FDD - based on quality information associated to each TBS (selection-
combining)];
\- [TDD - based on the presence/absence of the signal (selection)].
The internal DRNS handling of combining (respectively splitting) of Iub
(respectively Iur) DCH frames is controlled by the DRNS.
### 5.2.2 Control of Combining/Splitting Topology
When requesting the addition of a new cell for a UE-UTRAN connection for DCH,
the RNC of the SRNS (i.e. the SRNC) can explicitly request to the RNC of the
DRNS (i.e. the DRNC) a new Iur data stream, in which case the combining and
splitting function within the DRNS is not used for that cell. The SRNC can
also explicitly request from the DRNC the use of the combining and splitting
function inside the DRNS for that cell. Otherwise, the DRNS takes the decision
whether combining and splitting function is used inside the DRNS for that cell
i.e. whether a new Iur data stream shall be added or not.
For E-DCH combining at the DRNC is not allowed. However, combining in NodeB of
the DRNS is mandatory where applicable as described in [19].
### 5.2.3 Handling of DRNS Hardware Resources
Allocation and control of DRNS hardware resources, used for Iur data streams
and radio interface transmission/reception in DRNS is performed by DRNS.
### 5.2.4 Allocation of Physical Channels
Allocation of physical channels in cells belonging to DRNS is performed in
DRNS.
### 5.2.5 UpLink Power Control
This group of functions controls the level of the uplink transmitted power in
order to minimise uplink interference and keep the quality of the connections.
If the connection involves both a SRNS and a DRNS the function UL Outer Loop
Power Control (located in the SRNC) sets the target quality for the UL Inner
Loop Power Control function (located in Node B for DCH [FDD]). For E-DCH, the
DRNS (NodeB) reports the number of HARQ retransmissions to SRNC as an input to
the Outer Loop Power Control function.
### 5.2.6 Down-Link Power Control
This group of functions controls the level of the downlink transmitted power.
In FDD it is also used to correct the downlink power drifting between several
radio links. SRNC regularly (or under some algorithms) sends the target down
link power reference based on the measurement report from UE.
### 5.2.7 Admission Control
Admission control in a DRNC is implicitly invoked during radio link
setup/modify.
Information on UL interference and DL power on cells controlled by the DRNC
should be available across Iur.
Additional information exchanges between admission control functions located
in different RNCs are for further study.
### 5.2.8 Radio Protocol Functional Split
Iur supports the radio protocol functional split between SRNC and DRNC.
### 5.2.9 MBMS Bearer Type Control
MBMS Bearer type control is split between SRNC and DRNC. The CRNC is in
control of an MBMS Bearer of PTM type. The MBMS bearer services activated by
the UE are transferred over Iur from SRNC to DRNC. In case the CRNC is a DRNC
for one or several UEs, it indicates the selected bearer type to SRNC but it
is SRNC decision to set up or release MBMS bearers of PTP type for a given UE
as described in [18].
### 5.2.10 MBSFN MCCH Information Control
In case MRNC is used, MBSFN MCCH Information Control function is split between
MRNC and CRNC. The MRNC controls the logical resources of the RNSs that are
used for MBSFN operation within the MBSFN cluster(s). The MRNC informs the
CRNC of the MCCH configuration and schedule information to be used. The CRNC
performs the MCCH configuration and sends the MCCH information accordingly.
# 6 I~ur~ Interface Protocols
## 6.1 General
There shall exist a clear separation between the Radio Network Layer and the
Transport Layer. Therefore, the radio network signalling and Iur data streams
are separated from the data transport resource and traffic handling as shown
in Figure 2. Data transport resource and traffic handling is controlled by
Transport Signalling. The Transport Signalling is carried by a Signalling
Bearer over the Iur interface.
Figure 2: Separation of Radio Network Protocols and transport over Iur
## 6.2 Radio Signalling Protocols
### 6.2.1 RNSAP Protocol
The protocol responsible for providing signalling information across the Iur
interface is called the Radio Network Subsystem Application Part (RNSAP). A
subset of RNSAP is used over the Iur-g interface.
The RNSAP is terminated by the two RNCs inter-connected via the Iur interface
RNSAP Procedure Modules. In addition, the RNSAP is terminated by a RNC and a
BSS supporting Iu mode inter-connected via the Iur-g interface.
RNSAP procedures are divided into four modules as follows:
1\. RNSAP Basic Mobility Procedures;
2\. RNSAP Dedicated Procedures;
3\. RNSAP Common Transport Channel Procedures;
4\. RNSAP Global Procedures;
5\. RNSAP MBMS Procedures.
The Basic Mobility Procedures module contains procedures used to handle the
mobility within UTRAN as well as to handle mobility in case of UTRAN/GERAN
interworking.
The Dedicated Procedures module contains procedures that are used to handle
DCHs, [FDD -- F-DPCH,] E-DCH, [TDD -- DSCH, USCHs] and HS-DSCH between two
RNSs. If procedures from this module are not used in a specific Iur, then the
usage of DCH, [FDD -- F-DPCH,] E-DCH, [TDD \-- DSCH, USCH] and HS-DSCH traffic
between corresponding RNSs is not possible.
The Common Transport Channel Procedures module contains procedures that are
used to control common transport channel data streams (excluding the DSCH, HS-
DSCH, E-DCH and USCH) over Iur interface.
The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not related to a
specific UE. The procedures in this module are in contrast to the above
modules involving two peer CRNCs. The procedures in this module are also used
in cases involving one RNC and one BSS.
The MBMS Procedures module contains procedures that are specific to MBMS and
used for cases that cannot be handled by other modules.
## 6.3 User Plane Frame Protocols
### 6.3.1 Iub/Iur DCH Frame Protocol
There are two types of Iub/Iur DCH FP frames:
\- DCH data frame;
\- DCH control frame.
The contents of the Iub/Iur DCH data frame include:
\- Transport Block Sets;
\- Quality estimate.
The contents of the Iur DCH control frame include:
\- Measurement reports;
\- Power control information;
\- Synchronisation information.
For a more detailed description of the Iur/Iub DCH frame protocol refer to
\'UTRAN Iur & Iub Interface User Plane Protocol for DCH Data Streams\' [1].
### 6.3.2 Iur DSCH Frame Protocol [TDD]
There are two types of Iur DSCH FP frames:
\- DSCH data frame;
\- DSCH control frames.
The contents of the Iur DSCH data frame include:
\- MAC-c/sh SDUs;
\- User Buffer Status.
The contents of the Iur DSCH control frame include:

# 7 DRNS logical Model over I~ur~
## 7.1 Overview
The model in Figure 3 shows the Drift Radio Network System as seen from the
SRNC. It is modelled as a Â«black boxÂ» with a set of Radio Links on the Uu side
of the box and another set of User Plane access ports on the Iur side of the
box. The Radio Links are connected to the Iur user ports via the internal
transport mechanisms of the DRNS. Operations for controlling the connections
between ports are sent from the SRNC to the DRNC via an Iur Control Plane
port.
Figure 3: Drift RNS Logical Model
## 7.2 Logical Model Elements
### 7.2.1 Radio Link
A Radio Link represents a User Plane access point on the UTRAN side of the Uu
interface between the User Equipment and the UTRAN.
The semantics of a Radio Link include the following:
\- It is created, destroyed, and added by SRNC.
\- It can be attached to one or more Iur Data Ports at any given time.
\- Its resources are allocated and controlled by the DRNS.
### 7.2.2 Cell
It is defined by:
\- A Cell identifier.
The semantics of a Cell include the following:
\- It is created and destroyed by administrative procedures.
### 7.2.3 Iur DCH Data Port
One Iur DCH Data port represents one user plane transport bearer. One user
plane transport bearer will carry only one DCH data stream except in the case
of co-ordinated DCHs, in which case the data streams of all co-ordinated DCHs
shall be multiplexed on one and the same user plane transport bearer.
The semantics of an Iur DCH Data Port include the following:
\- It is created and destroyed by administrative procedures when transport
facilities are added to, or deleted from, the Iur interface between the SRNS
and DRNS. It can also be created and destroyed dynamically using dynamically
setup transport bearers to add or remove transport facilities.
\- It is assigned and released by the SRNC in reaction to requests for bearer
services from the UE.
\- It may be attached to one or more Radio Links. When attached to Radio Links
in the downlink direction, it acts as a point-to-multipoint connection for
diversity transmission. When attached to multiple Radio Links in the uplink
direction, it acts as a multipoint-to-point connection for diversity reception
[FDD].
\- The transmit and receive combining/splitting resources required to
implement the point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-point connections are
controlled by the DRNS [FDD].
\- The Iur DCH Data Stream emanating from the Iur DCH Data Port terminates in
the SRNS connected to DRNS.
### 7.2.4 Iur DSCH Data Port [TDD]
One Iur DSCH Data port represents one bi-directional Iur user plane transport
bearer. One Iur user plane transport bearer will carry only one DSCH data
stream.
### 7.2.5 Iur USCH Data Port [TDD]
One Iur USCH Data port represents one Iur user plane transport bearer. One Iur
user plane transport bearer will carry only one USCH data stream.
### 7.2.6 Iur RACH/FACH Data Port
The Iur RACH/FACH data port represents a transport bearer and is identified
with a transport bearer identity.
### 7.2.7 Iur Control Port
An Iur Control Port represents the Control Plane access point on the Iur
interface between the SRNS and the DRNS. It is defined by:
\- A transport bearer channel identifier.
The semantics of an Iur Control Port include the following:
\- It is created via administrative procedures when the Iur interface is
created.
### 7.2.8 Iur HS-DSCH Data Port
One Iur HS-DSCH Data port represents one bi-directional Iur user plane
transport bearer. One Iur user plane transport bearer will carry only one HS-
DSCH data stream.
### 7.2.9 Iur E-DCH Data Port
One Iur E-DCH Data port represents one bi-directional Iur user plane transport
bearer. One Iur user plane transport bearer will carry only one E-DCH data
stream. It is assigned and released by the SRNC in reaction to requests for
bearer services from the UE. [FDD - It may be attached to one or more Radio
Links. When attached to multiple Radio Links in the uplink direction, the
receive combining resources required to implement the multipoint-to-point
connections is in the NodeB of the DRNS.]
# 8 I~ur~ Interface Protocol Structure
The Iur interface protocol architecture consists of two functional layers:
\- Radio Network Layer, defines the procedures related to the interaction of
two RNCs within a PLMN. The radio network layer consists of a Radio Network
Control Plane and a Radio Network User Plane.
\- Transport layer, defines procedures for establishing physical connections
between two RNCs within a PLMN.
