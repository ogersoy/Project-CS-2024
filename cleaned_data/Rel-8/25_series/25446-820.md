# 4 General
## 4.1 General aspects for the SYNC protocol for UTRAN
### 4.1.1 General aspects
The MBMS Synchronisation protocol (SYNC) is located in the User plane of the
Radio Network layer over the Iu interface: the Iu UP protocol layer.
The SYNC protocol for UTRAN is used to convey user data associated to MBMS
Radio Access Bearers.
One SYNC protocol instance is associated to one MBMS RAB and one MBMS RAB
only. If several MBMS RABs are established towards one given UE, then these
MBMS RABs make use of several SYNC protocol instances.
SYNC protocol instances exist at Iu access point as defined [2] i.e. at CN and
UTRAN.
Whenever an MBMS RAB requires transfer of user data in the Iu UP, an Iu UP
protocol instance exists at each Iu interface access points. These Iu UP
protocol instances are established and released together with the associated
MBMS RAB.
The following figure illustrates the logical placement of the SYNC protocol
layer and the placement of the Data Streams sources outside of the Access
Stratum.
Figure 4.1.1-1: SYNC protocol layer occurrence in UTRAN overall architecture
(User Plane View)
# 5 SYNC protocol version 1
## 5.1 General
### 5.1.1 Applicablity of SYNC protocol version 1
This version of the specification specifies the SYNC protocol for UTRAN. It is
on top of TNL in Iu user plane, i.e. Iu userplane TNL transports SYNC protocol
PDUs over the Iu interface.
As a specification convention, within this specification, the interface
between the Core Network and the Radio Access Network is denoted as the "RAN
Access Interface", the termination point at the Radio Access Network is
denoted as "RAN Access Node", the termination point at the Core Network is
denoted as "Core Network" (CN). Further, "MBMS RAB" denotes the Radio Access
data bearer together with the RAN Access Interface data bearer for MBMS
service user data transmission.
For the application of the SYNC protocol to UTRAN, the RAN Access Interface is
the Iu interface, the RAN Access Node is the RNC.
### 5.1.1 Operation of the SYNC protocol
The SYNC protocol layer is present for data streams that originate in the CN
and carry additional information within a specific userplane-frame.
The two strata communicate through a Service Access Point for Non Access
Stratum (NAS) Data Streams transfer.
### 5.1.2 Interfaces of the SYNC protocol layer
As part of the Access Stratum responsibility, the SYNC protocol layer provides
the services and functions that are necessary to handle non access stratum
data streams for MBMS. The SYNC protocol layer is providing these services to
the UP upper layers through a Dedicated Service Access Point used for
Information Transfer.
The SYNC protocol layer is using services of the Transport layers in order to
transfer user plane PDUs over the RAN Access interface.
## 5.2 SYNC protocol layer services
The following functions are needed to support the SYNC protocol:
\- Transfer of user data along with synchronisation information;
\- Transfer of synchronisation information without user data.
## 5.3 Services Expected from the UP Data Transport layer
The SYNC protocol layer expects the following services from the Transport
Network Layer:
\- Transfer of user data.
\- no flow control
## 5.4 Elementary procedures
### 5.4.1 Transfer of User Data for MBMS procedure
#### 5.4.1.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of User Data procedure for MBMS is to transfer RAN
Access Interface UP frames from the RAN Access interface UP protocol layers at
CN to the RAN Access interface UP protocol layer at the RAN Access Node. One
RAN Access interface UP instance is associated to a single MBMS RAB only.
The Transfer of User Data procedure is invoked whenever user data for that
particular RAB needs to be sent across the Radio Access interface.
The NAS Data Streams specific functions make the padding of the payload (if
needed) so that the Radio Access interface UP frame payload will be an integer
number of octets. Then the NAS Data Streams specific functions perform, if
needed, CRC calculation of the Iu frame payload and passes the Radio Access
interface UP frame payload down to the Frame Handler function.
The Frame Handler function within the CN retrieves the packet counter and
octet counter value from its internal memory, formats the frame header and
frame payload into the appropriate PDU Type and sends the Radio Access
interface UP frame PDU to the lower layers for transfer across the Radio
Access interface. If the user data is provided with compressed IP header, the
Radio Access interface UP frame contains PDCP information and the uncompressed
IP header.
The Frame Handler function within the CN is also responsible for appropriate
setting of the Time Stamp value in order to allow all RAN Access nodes to
submit the MBMS user data in a synchronised manner.
Upon reception of a user data frame, the RAN Access interface UP protocol
layer within the RAN Access node checks the consistency of the RAN Access
interface UP frame as follows:
\- The Frame Handler function checks the consistency of the frame header and
the consistency of the packet counter value.
\- Then the RAN Access node utilises the time stamp information to schedule
the user data on the radio interface on the next TTI.
Figure 5.4.1.1-1. Successful Transfers of User Data.
#### 5.4.1.2 Unsuccessful operation
If the RAN Access interface UP frame carrying the user data is incorrectly
formatted or cannot be correctly treated by the receiving RAN Access interface
UP protocol layer, or if a frame loss is detected due a gap in the sequence of
the received frame numbers, the RAN Access node shall cease to provide user
data to the radio interface protocol entities and wait until the next
synchronisation sequence if soft combining and MBSFN are used, or until the
next scheduling transmission interval if the MRNC and TDM multiplexing are
used.
### 5.4.2 Transfer of Synchronisation Information for MBMS procedure (without
user data)
#### 5.4.2.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of Synchronisation Information for MBMS procedure
is to transfer synchronisation information from the CN to the RAN Access node
at the end of each synchronization sequence (see [4]) to improve the RAN
Access node resynchronization in case of packet loss.
The Frame Handler function within the CN retrieves the synchronisation time
stamp from its internal clock and the total packet counter and total octet
counter from its internal memory, formats the frame header and frame payload
into the appropriate PDU Type and sends the RAN Access interface UP frame PDU
to the lower layers for transfer across the RAN Access interface.
Upon reception of a user data frame, the RAN Access interface UP protocol
layer checks the consistency of the RAN Access interface UP frame as follows:
\- The Frame Handler function checks the consistency of the frame header and
the consistency of the synchronisation time stamp, total packet counter and
total octet counter.
Figure 5.4.2.1-1. Successful Transfers of Synchronisation Information.
#### 5.4.2.2 Unsuccessful operation
If the RAN Access interface UP frame without user data is incorrectly
formatted or cannot be correctly treated by the receiving RAN Access interface
UP protocol layer, the RAN Access interface UP protocol layer shall either
discard the frame or pass it to the upper layers with a frame classification
indicating a corrupted frame.
## 5.5 Elements for the SYNC protocol
### 5.5.1 General
In the present document the structure of frames will be specified by using
figures similar to Figure 5.5.1-1.
Bits | 
> Number of Octets
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |  |   
Field 1 | Field 2 | 1 | Octet 1 | Header part |  |  |  |  |

Figure 5.5.1-1. Example frame format.
Unless otherwise indicated, fields which consist of multiple bits within an
octet will have the more significant bit located at the higher bit position
(indicated above frame in Figure 5.5.1-1). In addition, if a field spans
several octets, more significant bits will be located in lower numbered octets
(right of frame in Figure 5.5.1-1).
On the Iu interface, the frame will be transmitted starting from the lowest
numbered octet. Within each octet, the bits are sent according decreasing bit
position (bit position 7 first).
Spare bits should be set to \"0\" by the sender and should not be checked by
the receiver.
The header part of the frame is always an integer number of octets. The
payload part is octet rounded (by adding \'Padding\' when needed).
The receiver should be able to remove an additional spare extension field that
may be present at the end of a frame. See description of Spare extension
field.

not applicable
## 5.6 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
### 5.6.1 General
void
### 5.6.2 CRC Calculation
The parity bits are generated by one of the following cyclic generator
polynomials:
g~CRC6~(D) = D^6^ + D^5^ + D^3^ + D^2^ + D^1^ + 1;
g~CRC10~(D) = D^10^ + D^9^ + D^5^ + D^4^ + D^1^ + 1.
Denote the bits to be protected of a frame by {width="1.0965277777777778in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}({width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}being the bit with the highest bit position in
the first octet), and the parity bits by {width="1.1666666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}. _A~i~_ is the length of the protected data and
L _~i~_ is 6 or 10 depending on the CRC length.
The encoding is performed in a systematic form, which means that in GF(2), the
polynomial
{width="4.208333333333333in" height="0.2777777777777778in"}
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC6~(D) and the polynomial
{width="4.277777777777778in" height="0.2777777777777778in"}
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC10~(D). If
{width="0.44375in" height="0.25in"}, {width="1.8194444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}.
### 5.6.3 Relation between input and output of the Cyclic Redundancy Check
The protected bits are left unchanged in the frame. The parity bits for the
Header CRC are put in the Header CRC field with{width="0.19375in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} being the highest bit position of the first
octet of the Header CRC field. The parity bits for the Payload CRC are put in
the Payload CRC field with{width="0.19375in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}
being the highest bit position of the first octet of the Payload CRC field.
