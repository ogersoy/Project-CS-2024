# 4 Overview
In Release 8, a Home NodeB may provide restricted access to only UEs belonging
to a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG). One or more of such cells, known as CSG
cells, are identified by a unique numeric identifier called CSG Identity. To
facilitate access control, a UE with CSG subscription would have an Allowed
CSG List, which contains one or more CSG Identities associated with the CSG
cells on which the UE is allowed access. The UE uses the Allowed CSG List
along with the CSG Identity broadcast by the CSG Cells in CSG cell selection
and reselection.
In addition, manual selection of CSG Identity is introduced, which enables the
human user to manually select a CSG Identity for the UE to camp on.
This document provides high level descriptions and procedures of the mobility
features to support CSG deployment in Release 8. The following areas will be
covered in the subsequent chapters:
  * Identifiers associated with the CSG framework
  * Manual selection of CSG Identity
  * Measurement rules for CSG Cells
  * Cell reselection to a CSG cell, from a CSG cell, and between CSG cells
  * Handover to a CSG cell, from a CSG cell, and between allowed CSG cells, where applicable.
# 5 CSG Identification
One or more Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) cells are identified by a unique
numeric identifier called CSG Identity or CSG ID. A UE belonging to a CSG has
the corresponding CSG ID in its Allowed CSG List. The Allowed CSG List is
maintained and provided by NAS. The CSG ID is broadcast in system information
by the CSG cell, and used by the UE for cell (re)selection purposes.
A cell may optionally broadcast the CSG Indicator, whose presence and value of
TRUE indicates the cell is a CSG cell.
A CSG cell may broadcast the HNB Name, a textual identifier, in system
information. The HNB Name can be used to aid the human user in manual
selection of a CSG ID.
At the physical layer, a CSG cell is identified by its carrier frequency
(UARFCN) and Primary Scrambling Code (PSC). A set of PSC could be reserved for
CSG deployment and this reserved PSC range may be signalled in system
information. The PSC of a CSG cell belongs to the reseverd PSC range if
broadcasted.
On the mixed carrier frequency shared by both non-CSG cells (UMTS macro cells)
and CSG cells, CSG cells broadcast in system information the PSC range
reserved by the network for CSG cells. The non-CSG cells may also broadcast
the reserved PSC range. The reserved PSC range is only applicable to the
UARFCN within the PLMN where the UE received this information. The UE
considers the last received reserved PSC range to be valid within the entire
PLMN for the duration of 24 hours. The UE may use the reserved PSC information
for CSG cell search and (re)selection purposes, according to UE's
implementation.
Macro cells and CSG cells may broadcast indications of one or more carrier
frequencies used for dedicated CSG deployment. This information may be used by
a UE to avoid unnecessary measurements on that frequency even when cell
measurement rules would require measurements of this carrier frequency.
Indications of which carrier frequencies are dedicated to CSG-only deployment
may be signalled in system information and are applicable only in the cell
where this information is broadcasted.
# 6 CSG Selection
## 6.1 Manual CSG ID Selection
Manual CSG ID selection enables a human user to select a CSG ID. In manual CSG
ID selection the UE may scan all frequencies in the supported frequency bands
and display a list of found CSG IDs or the corresponding HNB Names if
broadcast by the CSG cells belonging to the registered PLMN, and indications
as to whether the found CSG IDs are contained in the UE's Allowed CSG List.
When the user selects an entry in the list, the UE selects any CSG cell among
the ones with same CSG ID. The UE may normally camp on the chosen cell if it
is an allowed CSG cell.
During manual CSG ID selection a UE is allowed to perform Location
Registration procedure on a CSG cell which CSD ID is not in the Allowed CSG
List.
Based on the outcome of a Location Registration procedure initiated on a CSG
cell the UE's Allowed CSG List is updated.
The UE is allowed to _not_ support manual CSG selection in connected mode.
# 7 CSG Cell Reselection
## 7.1 Measurement Rules for CSG Cells
To measure allowed CSG cell(s), a UE applies an autonomous search function,
per UE implementation, regardless of which RAT the UE is camping on. The
autonomous search function determines when and where to search for the allowed
CSG cells.
On a mixed carrier, a UE may avoid measurements of any CSG cells that are
known by the UE to be not allowed.
A UE may avoid measurements of any CSG cells that are known by the UE to be
not allowed on the carrier frequency dedicated to CSG deployment.
## 7.2 Reselection to CSG Cell
The cell reselection criteria described in this section is applicable when the
UE is in the following call states: Idle Mode, Cell_PCH and URA_PCH states,
but not Cell_FACH, unless otherwise stated.
### 7.2.1 Criteria for Intra-frequency Cell Reselection
For intra-frequency reselection from a non-CSG cell to an allowed CSG cell,
the UE follows the same cell ranking rules as those defined for the UTRA case
in [2]. The UE may ignore not allowed CSG cells in the ranking. The UE applies
reselection parameters broadcast by the serving cell. A UE may normally camp
on an allowed CSG cell.
### 7.2.2 Criteria for Inter-frequency Cell Reselection
For inter-frequency cell reselection, the UE considers the frequency where its
allowed CSG cell is on to have the highest priority value, irrespective of
network configured frequency priorities, as long as the CSG cell remains
allowed and best ranked on that frequency.
### 7.2.3 Criteria for Inter-RAT Cell Reselection
Inter-RAT reselection to an allowed CSG cell is supported when the UE is
camped on another RAT. The UE requirements are defined in the specifications
of the concerned RAT.
## 7.3 Reselection from CSG Cell
### 7.3.1 Criteria for Intra-frequency Cell Reselection
For intra-frequency reselection from an allowed CSG cell to a non-CSG cell,
the UE follows the same cell ranking rules as those defined for the UTRA case
defined in [2].
### 7.3.2 Criteria for Inter-frequency Cell Reselection
For inter-frequency reselection from an allowed CSG cell to a non-CSG cell,
the UE follows the same cell ranking rules as those defined for the UTRA case
defined in [2].
### 7.3.3 Criteria for Inter-RAT Cell Reselection
For reselection from a CSG cell to a GSM or E-UTRA cell, the UE follows the
respective procedures defined in [2].
## 7.4 Reselection from CSG Cell to CSG Cell
For reselection between allowed CSG cells, the UE follows the same cell
ranking rules as those defined for the UTRA case in [2].
## 7.5 Parameters for CSG Cell Reselection
No new parameters are defined for CSG cell ranking. The same cell reselection
parameters defined for the UTRA case in [2] are used for CSG cell ranking
purposes, if configured. The operator may configure the cell reselection
parameters, such as Qoffset and Qhyst, to bias the reselection of CSG cells.
# 8 CSG Cell Handover
## 8.1 Handover to CSG Cell
In Cell_DCH state, handover from a non-CSG cell to an allowed CSG cell is not
within the scope of Release 8.
## 8.2 Handover from CSG Cell
In Cell_DCH state, the handover procedure from an allowed CSG cell to a non-
CSG cell is expected to be the same as the procedure specified in [3].
## 8.3 Handover from CSG Cell to CSG Cell
In Cell_DCH state, handover between allowed CSG cells with the same CSG ID is
expected to be the same as the procedure specified in [3].
In Cell_DCH state, handover between allowed CSG cells with different CSG IDs
is expected to be the same as the procedure specified in [3].
