# 4 Data Link Layer
## 4.1 ATM Transport Option
ATM shall be used in the transport network user plane and the transport
network control plane according to ITU-T Recommendation I.361 [1]. The
structure of the cell header used in the UTRAN Iu interface is the cell header
format and encoding at NNI (see figure 3/I.361).
## 4.2 IP Transport Option
An RNC/CN-node supporting IP transport option on the Iu interface shall
support PPP protocol with HDLC framing [25], [26].
NOTE: This does not preclude the single implementation and use of any other
protocols (e.g. PPPMux/AAL5/ATM, PPP/AAL2/ATM, Ethernet, MPLS/ATM, etc.)
fulfilling the UTRAN requirements toward the upper layers.
An RNC/CN-node supporting IP transport option on the Iu interface and having
interfaces connected via low bandwidth PPP links like E1/T1/J1 shall also
support IP Header Compression [27] and the PPP extensions ML/MC-PPP [28],
[29]. In this case the negotiation of header compression [27] over PPP shall
be performed via [30].
# 5 Circuit switched domain
## 5.1 Transport network user plane
### 5.1.1 General
There are two options for the transport layer for data streams over Iu-CS:
1) ATM based Transport (ATM transport option)
2) IP based Transport (IP transport option)
The following figure shows the protocol stacks of the two options.
Figure 1. Transport network layer for data streams over Iu-CS.
### 5.1.2 ATM Transport Option
#### 5.1.2.1 ATM Adaptation Layer 2
##### 5.1.2.1.1 AAL2-Segmentation and Reassembly Service Specific Convergence
Sublayer (I.366.1)
Service Specific Segmentation and Reassembly (SSSAR) sublayer of ITU-T
Recommendation I.366.1 [4] is used for the segmentation and reassembly of AAL2
SDUs (i.e., only SSSAR is used from ITU-T Recommendation I.366.1).
##### 5.1.2.1.2 AAL2-specification (I.363.2)
AAL2 shall be used according to ITU-T Recommendation I.363.2 [2].
### 5.1.3 IP Transport Option
#### 5.1.3.1 General
In the IP transport option RTP over UDP over IP shall be supported as the
transport for data streams on the Iu-CS interface. The data link layer is as
specified in subclause 4.2.
The transport bearer is identified by the UDP port number and the IP address
(source UDP port number, destination UDP port number, source IP address,
destination IP address).
The source IP address and destination IP address exchanged via RANAP on the
Iu-CS interface shall use the NSAP structure. See sub clause 6.1.8.2 in [36].
#### 5.1.3.2 UDP/IP
The path protocol used shall be UDP [12].
An IP RNC/CN-node shall support IPv6. The support of IPv4 is optional.
NOTE: This does not preclude single implementation and use of IPv4.
IP dual stack support is recommended for the potential transition period from
IPv4 to IPv6 in the transport network.
There may be one or several IP addresses in the RNC and in the CN. The packet
processing function in the CN shall send downstream packets of a given RAB to
the RNC IP address / UDP port (received in RANAP) associated to that
particular RAB. The packet processing function in the RNC shall send upstream
packets of a given RAB to the CN IP address / UDP port (received in RANAP)
associated to that particular RAB. If there is no RNC IP address / UDP port
yet associated to the packet processing function in the CN for a RAB not yet
finally set-up, the packet processing function in the CN for that RAB shall
extract the source IP address / UDP port from the first received IP packet to
identify the peer IP/UDP entity. The packet processing function in the RNC
shall use the same source IP address / UDP port as is sent to CN in RANAP.
The RNC/CN-node shall use two consecutive port numbers for the RTP bearer and
for the optional RTCP connection that transport a single Iu UP connection. Two
such consecutive port numbers are termed "port number block" in what follows.
The first port number shall be even and shall be assigned to the RTP protocol.
The next port number shall be assigned to the RTCP protocol. This port shall
be reserved even if the optional RTCP protocol is not used.
Each RNC/CN-node shall administer the port numbers it intends to use for
RTP/RTCP port number blocks.
#### 5.1.3.3 RTP
RTP [22] shall be applied.
##### 5.1.3.3.1 RTP Header

127 shall be used. The value shall be ignored in the receiving entity.
###### 5.1.3.3.1.7 Sequence Number
The sequence number shall be supplied by the source of an RTP PDU. The sink of
an RTP PDU may ignore the sequence number or it may use it to obtain
statistics about the link quality and / or to correct out-of-sequence
delivery, e.g. by dropping out-of-sequence packets.
###### 5.1.3.3.1.8 Timestamp
The timestamp shall be supplied by the source of an RTP PDU. A clock frequency
of 16000 Hz shall be used. The sink of an RTP PDU may ignore the timestamp or
it may use it to obtain statistics about the link quality and / or to correct
jitter.
###### 5.1.3.3.1.9 Synchronisation Source (SSRC)
The source of an RTP PDU shall supply a SSRC. The sink of an RTP PDU may
ignore the SSRC if it does not use RTCP.
###### 5.1.3.3.1.10 CSRC list
This list is empty.
##### 5.1.3.3.2 RTP Payload
A single Iu UP PDU, as described in [24], shall be transported as RTP payload.
#### 5.1.3.4 RTCP
RTCP [22] may be applied. RTCP over UDP [12] over IPv6 [16] shall be used
(IPv4 [13] may be used optionally). The use of the RTCP protocol is optional.
The receiving entity may ignore incoming RTCP PDUs.
Figure 1a shows the protocol stack for the transport of RTCP. The above
Sections about IP and UDP shall also apply for the transport of RTCP.
+---------------------------+ | RTCP _(RFC 1889)_ | +---------------------------+ | UDP _(RFC 768)_ | +---------------------------+ | _IPv6 (RFC2460)_ | | | | _IPv4 optional (RFC 791)_ | +---------------------------+

#### 5.1.3.5 Diffserv code point marking
IP Differentiated Services code point marking [19] shall be supported. The
mapping between traffic categories and Diffserv code points shall be
configurable by O&M for each traffic category. Traffic categories are
implementation-specific and may be determined from the application parameters.
## 5.2 Transport network control plane
### 5.2.1 General
The following figure shows the protocol stack for transport signalling over
Iu-CS in ATM based transport (ATM transport option). An ALCAP protocol is not
required when both UTRAN and CN nodes are using the IP based transport (IP
transport option).
The protocol stack for IP-ALCAP in IP to ATM interworking case is defined in
chapter 5.3.3 of this Technical Specification.

An RNC/CN-node supporting IP transport option shall provide interworking to a
CN-node/RNC supporting only ATM transport option.
### 5.3.2 Interworking Alternatives
For interworking with a CN-node/RNC supporting only ATM transport option, the
RNC/CN-node supporting IP transport option shall additionally support at least
one of the following interworking mechanisms:
1) ATM&IP dual stack. An IP-ALCAP protocol is not required in this
interworking solution.
Annex A of this technical specification shows an example of protocols for the
case the ATM&IP RNC/CN-node has no ATM connectivity.
2) An Interworking Function (IWF), either internal or external to the RNC/CN

#### 6.1.2.1 General
In the ATM transport option, the protocol architecture for the User Plane of
the Iu interface towards the packet switched domain shall be GTP-U [17] over
UDP over IP over AAL5 over ATM. One or several AAL5/ATM permanent VC\'s may be

RAB to the CN IP address (received in RANAP) associated to that particular
RAB.
There is one RNC IP address per RNC in the CN associated with one MBMS RAB.

###### ## Annex A (informative): IP-ATM Interworking
# A.1 Application of IP tunnelling in IP-ATM interworking alternative 1 in
case of no direct ATM connectivity at the IP&ATM dual stack RNC/CN-node
One possibility of enabling ATM connectivity to the IP&ATM dual stack RNC/CN-
node in the IP-ATM interworking alternative 1 scenario specified in chapter
5.3.2 is to use any ATM emulation over IP protocol from the IETF standards
e.g. via tunnelling techniques.
# A.2 Application of IP-ALCAP in IP-ATM interworking alternative 2
One example scenario of IP-ATM interworking alternative 2 of section 5.3.2 is
to use IP-ALCAP as specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.2631.1 (10/2003) as the
bearer control protocol between the RNC/CN Node and its external IWF. The
following figure shows the corresponding protocol stack.
