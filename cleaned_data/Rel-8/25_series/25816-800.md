# 4 Study of the RF requirements
This chapter describes the reusability of the existing UMTS850/1800 simulation
results, the additional UMTS900 deployment scenarios, simulation assumptions,
and derived RF requirements for UMTS900 BS and UE.
## 4.1 Reusability of existing UMTS 850 and UMTS 1800 MHz simulation results
and RF requirements
The Band I RF requirements have been determined by system simulations assuming
the 2 GHz propagation models of TR 25.942[2]. The system simulation
methodology, assumptions, and results for the derivation of UMTS1800/1900 RF
requirements are reported and described in TR25.885[3]. The same deployment
scenarios and similar system simulation assumptions were used for the
derivation of UMTS850 RF requirements, the summary of the simulation results
can be found in the document R4-031025[4]. The difference of propagation
pathloss between 900 MHz band and 1800 MHz/2100 MHz bands can be as big as 10
dB, but the propagation pathloss difference between 900 MHz band and 850 MHz
band is only of 0.46 dB, calculated with Hata model. So the simulation results
for UMTS850 can be considered as valid for UMTS900. Therefore, it is proposed
that, whenever applicable, the Band V (850 MHz band) simulation results and RF
requirements will be reused for UMTS900.
## 4.2 Additional deployment scenarios and simulation results
Six additional deployment scenarios have been identified and agreed for UMTS
900 [5], the simulation assumptions and the simulation results for these
additional deployment scenarios are described below.
### 4.2.1 Scenario_1: UMTS(macro)-GSM(macro) in Urban area with cell range of
500 m in uncoordinated operation

#### 4.2.1.2 Analysis method
The objective of Monte-carlo simulations is to determine the appropriate UMTS
BS & UE RF system parameters, Spectrum mask, ACLR (Adjacent Channel power
Leakage Ratio), ACS (Adjacent Channel Selectivity), receiver narrow band
blocking, etc. for ensuring the good co-existence of UMTS and GSM. In the
simulation, the UMTS UL/DL capacity losses as function of ACIR (Adjacent
Channel Interference Ratio) are simulated, the GSM UL/DL system outage
degradations at given ACIR values or as function of ACIR are also simulated.
In the simulations, the ACIR is used as a variable parameter.
In order to analyse the simulation results, it is supposed that UMTS900 system
(BS & UE) has the same RF requirements, such as Tx spectrum mask, ACLR, ACS,
narrow band blocking characteristics as defined in TS25.104 and TS25.101 for
UMTS850/1800 (band V, band III), the spectrum mask of GSM BS & MS are defined
in 3GPP TS45.005. Then the simulation results are analyzed based on these
assumptions for checking if the assumed RF characteristics are sufficient or
not for ensuring the required good co-existence between UMTS900 and GSM900 in
the same geographical area.
RAN WG4 agreed threshold for co-existence is that UMTS UL/DL capacity loss due
to interferences from GSM UL/DL should not be bigger than 5%. Concerning the
impact on GSM network performance, since GSM network capacity is fixed, the
evaluation criterion is the system outage degradation, the system outage
degradation should be as small as possible.
For the co-existence between UMTS and GSM, the ACLR of UMTS BS & UE are
calculated with the BS & UE Tx spectrum mask by the integration over a 200 kHz
bandwidth centered at the carrier separation between UMTS and GSM.
WCDMA node B emissions to GSM MS as a function of carrier separation are
plotted in figure 2. WCDMA UE emissions to GSM BS as a function of carrier
separation are given in figure 3.

The ACS of UMTS BS and UE are derived from the assumed narrow band blocking
(GSM interferer) requirements at 2.8 MHz carrier separation. The narrow band
blocking of WCDMA BS was defined in TS25.104 as -47 dBm at 2.8 MHz carrier
separation which is measured with a useful signal at -115 dBm (6 dB above
reference sensitivity level of WCDMA BS). The narrow band blocking of WCDMA UE
was defined in TS25.101 as -56 dBm at 2.8 MHz carrier separation which was
measured with useful signal at a level of 10 dB above UE reference
sensitivity.
The ACLR and ACS of UMTS BS & UE for carrier separation of 2.8 MHz and 4.8 MHz
are given in the table 2.

* * *
Note* ACS =30.5 dB is derived with the UMTS UE noise floor of -96 dBm. At the
noise floor of -99 dBm, the UE ACS will be 33.5 dB.
The ACLR (over 3.84 MHz bandwidth) of GSM BS and MS can be derived from the
GSM BS and MS transmission mask defined in 3GPP TS45.005. The derived ACLR of
GSM900 BS and MS for the co-existence with UMTS at carrier separation of 2.8
MHz and 4.8 MHz are respectively given in the table 3.

#### 4.2.2.2 Analysis method
The objective of Monte-carlo simulations is to determine the appropriate UMTS
BS & UE RF system parameters, Spectrum mask, ACLR (Adjacent Channel power
Leakage Ratio), ACS (Adjacent Channel Selectivity), receiver narrow band
blocking, etc. for ensuring the good co-existence of UMTS and GSM. In the
simulation, the UMTS UL/DL capacity losses as function of ACIR (Adjacent
Channel Interference Ratio) are simulated, the GSM UL/DL system outage
degradations at given ACIR values or as function of ACIR are also simulated.
In the simulations, the ACIR is used as a variable parameter.
The assumptions of UMTS BS & UE RF characterics (Spectrum mask, ACLR, ACS)
were described in the section 4.2.1.2, the GSM system (BS & MS) RF
characteristics and the derived ACIR values were also given in the section
4.2.1.2.
Ran_4 agreed threshold for co-existence is that UMTS UL/DL capacity loss due
to interferences from GSM UL/DL should not be bigger than 5%. Concerning the
impact on GSM network performance, since GSM network capacity is fixed, the
evaluation criterion is the system outage degradation, the system outage
degradation should be as small as possible.
#### 4.2.2.3 Simulation results & analysis
Based on the Ran 4 agreed co-existence scenario 2 and simulation assumptions
described in section 4.2.2.1, simulation results for this co-existence
scenario 2 from several companies have been presented and discussed. The
simulation results data from different companies for this co-existence
scenario are summarized in the enclosed excel table.
The simulation results data from different companies for this co-existence
scenario are summarized in tables 8A to 8G.

#### 4.2.3.2 Analysis method
The objective of Monte-carlo simulations is to determine the appropriate UMTS
BS & UE RF system parameters, Spectrum mask, ACLR (Adjacent Channel power
Leakage Ratio), ACS (Adjacent Channel Selectivity), receiver narrow band
blocking, etc. for ensuring the good co-existence of UMTS and GSM. In the
simulation, the UMTS UL/DL capacity losses as function of ACIR (Adjacent
Channel Interference Ratio) are simulated, the GSM UL/DL system outage
degradations at given ACIR values or as function of ACIR are also simulated.
In the simulations, the ACIR is used as a variable parameter.
The assumptions of UMTS BS & UE RF characterics (Spectrum mask, ACLR, ACS)
were described in the section 4.2.1.2, the GSM system (BS & MS) RF
characteristics and the derived ACIR values were also given in the section
4.2.1.2.
Ran_4 agreed threshold for co-existence is that UMTS UL/DL capacity loss due
to interferences from GSM UL/DL should not be bigger than 5%. Concerning the
impact on GSM network performance, since GSM network capacity is fixed, the
evaluation criterion is the system outage degradation, the system outage
degradation should be as small as possible.
#### 4.2.3.3 Simulation results & analysis
Based on the Ran 4 agreed co-existence scenario and simulation assumptions
described in section 4.2.3.1, simulation results for this co-existence
scenario 3 from several companies have been presented and discussed. The
simulation result data from different companies for this co-existence scenario
3 are summarized in tables 11A and 11B.

#### 4.2.4.2 Analysis method
The objective of Monte-carlo simulations is to determine the appropriate UMTS
BS & UE RF system parameters, Spectrum mask, ACLR (Adjacent Channel power
Leakage Ratio), ACS (Adjacent Channel Selectivity), etc. for ensuring the good
co-existence of UMTS and UMTS. In the simulation, the UMTS UL/DL capacity
losses as function of ACIR (Adjacent Channel Interference Ratio) are
simulated. In the simulations, the ACIR is used as a variable parameter.
In order to analyse the simulation results, it is supposed that UMTS900 system
(BS & UE) has the same RF characteristics, such as Tx spectrum mask, ACLR,
ACS, as defined in TS25.104 and TS25.101 for UMTS850/1800 (band V, band III).
The simulation results will be analyzed based on these assumptions for
checking if the assumed RF characteristics are sufficient or not for UMTS900
deployment in co-existence with other UMTS900 network.
The ACLR and ACS of UTRA-FDD BS and UTRA-FDD UE defined in TS25.104 and
TS25.101 are summarized in the table 13 below.
Table 13: ACLR and ACS of UTRA-FDD BS and UE

              UTRA-FDD BS   UTRA-FDD UE
ACLR (dB) 45 33 ACS (dB) 46.3 33

The ACIR (Adjacent Channel Interference Ratio) can be calculated by the
formula (1) given in section 4.2.1.2 and the results are given in the table
14.

Simulation assumptions for the co-existence scenario 5 are summarized in table
15. As described in the table 15, two simulation cases of GSM downlink and GSM
upink as victim will be studied by Monte-carlo simulation. Some of UMTS UE and
GSM MS are placed inside of the buildings (for UE and MS located on the
building blocks). The UMTS UE and GSM MS located in the streat are considered
as outdoot UE.

#### 4.2.5.2 Analysis method
The objective of Monte-carlo simulations is to determine the appropriate UMTS
BS & UE RF system parameters, Spectrum mask, ACLR (Adjacent Channel power
Leakage Ratio), ACS (Adjacent Channel Selectivity), receiver narrow band
blocking, etc. for ensuring the good co-existence of UMTS and GSM. In the
simulation, the GSM UL/DL system outage degradations at given ACIR values or
as function of ACIR are simulated. In the simulations, the ACIR is used as a
variable parameter.
The assumptions of UMTS BS & UE RF characterics (Spectrum mask, ACLR, ACS)
were described in the section 4.2.1.2, the GSM system (BS & MS) RF
characteristics (ACLR, ACS) were also given in the section 4.2.1.2. The
derived ACIR of GSM DL/UL for the carrier separation of 2.8 MHz and 4.8 MHz
between UMTS carrier and the nearest GSM carrier were described in the section
4.1.2.2.
The threshold used for the evaluation of the impact on GSM network performance
due to interference from UMTS is the system outage degradation. The system
outage degradation should be as small as possible.
#### 4.2.5.3 Simulation results & analysis
Based on the Ran 4 agreed co-existence scenario 5 and simulation assumptions
as described in the section 4.2.5.1, simulation results data for this co-
existence scenario 5 are summarized in tables 15C and 15D.

##### 4.2.5.3.1 GSM microcell DL System Outage Degradation (%) due to
interference from UMTS macrocell DL
Six simulation curves of GSM downlink system outage degradation in function of
ACIR between UMTS carrier and the nearest GSM carrier for the co-existence
scenario 5 is plotted in figure 26.
The calculated ACIR of GSM DL for the carrier separation of 2.8 MHz and 4.8
MHz between UMTS carrier and the nearest GSM carrier were described in the
section 4.1.2.2, they are respectively of 50 dB and 63 dB for 2.8 MHz and 4.8
MHz carrier separations. As shown in the figure 26, the GSM DL system outage
degradation at ACIR=50 dB is below 0.9%, at ACIR=63 dB is smaller than 0.3%.

Figure 27: GSM UL System Outage Degradation (%) due to interference from UMTS
UL (Scenario_5)
Six simulation results of GSM uplink system outage degradation due to
interference from UMTS uplink for the co-existence scenario 5 as function of
ACIR between UMTS carrier and the nearest GSM carrier are plotted in figure
27.
The derived ACIR of GSM UL for the carrier separation of 2.8 MHz and 4.8 MHz
between UMTS carrier and the nearest GSM carrier were described in the section
4.1.2.2, they are respectively of 31.3 dB and 43.3 dB for 2.8 MHz and 4.8 MHz
carrier separations. As shown in the figure 27, the GSM microcell UL system
outage degradation at ACIR=31.3 dB corresponding 2.8 MHz carrier separation is
below 0.6%, that at ACIR=43.3 dB corresponding 4.8 MHz carrier separation is
smaller than 0.25%.
It can be observed that GSM microcell DL/UL system outage degradation due to
interference from UMTS DL/UL is bigger than that for the co-existence case
between UMTS macrocell and GSM macrocell in urban environment. This GSM
microcell DL/UL system outage degradation increase can come from several
possible reasons:
\- GSM microcell BS antenna height is lower, the MCL and propagation loss
between GSM BS and MS is smaller, it is also smaller between GSM BS and UMTS
UE;
\- Distribution of GSM MS and UMTS UE inside of the buildings are considered
in the simulation for this microcellular scenario.
It can also be seen that GSM downlink system outage degradation is higher than
that of GSM uplink, even GSM microcellular base station antenna is much lower
than GSM macrocellular base station antenna, the distance between GSM
microcell BS and the interfering UMTS UE is relatively small.
The simulation results show that the GSM DL/UL system outage degradation at
carrier separation of 4.8 MHz is much smaller than that at carrier separation
of 2.8 MHz.
#### 4.2.5.4 Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the simulation results for the co-existence scenario
5 between UMTS(macro) and GSM(micro) in urban area in uncoordinated operation,
it can be concluded that :
1) GSM DL/UL system outage degradation due to interference from UMTS DL/UL for
GSM microcellular case is higher than that for GSM macrocellular case;
2) The GSM microcell DL/UL system outage degradation due to interference from
UMTS macrocell DL/UL at carrier separation between UMTS carrier and the
nearest GSM carrier of 4.8 MHz is much smaller than that at the carrier
separation of 2.8 MHz;
3) RF system characteristics assumed for UMTS900 seem to be sufficient, there
could be some impact on GSM microcell DL/UL system performance, but the impact
is limited and small. The increase of carrier separation between UMTS carrier
and the nearest GSM microcell carrier will help to reduce the GSM
microcellular system outage degradation. It is recommended to use a GSM
micellular sub-band as far as possible from UMTS carrier.
4) In order to minimise the impact on GSM microcellular network outage
degradation due to UMTS, the recommended frequency band plan is shown below in
Figure 28, GSM macrocell sub-band should be placed between the GSM microcell
sub-band and UMTS carrier.

###### 4.2.6.2.2.6 Analysis of the impact on GSM picocell uplink
The GSM picocell uplink performance should be analyzed in the cases with and
without the presence of interference from the UMTS UE for the assumptions
given above; i.e. _df_ = 2.8 MHz & 4.8 MHz, _IPF_ = 10 dB & 15 dB and
separation distance between UMTS UE and GSM pico BS = 3 m & 15 m. It is
assumed that GSM uplink is power controlled and the link performance is
achieved at 6 dB target _SIR_. In addition, the thermal noise floor is _N~t~_
= -94 dBm/200 kHz and 10 dB margin is assumed for interference and shadow
fading denoted by _M_.
###### 4.2.6.2.2.7 GSM picocell uplink without UMTS UE interference
The required received power at the GSM pico BS to achieve the target SIR is
denoted by Rx_required and given as
Rx_required = Nt + M + SIR = -78 dBm
Hence, the required transmit power of GSM MS at the cell edge denoted by
Tx_required in dBm is
Tx_required = Rx_required + Pathloss(D =50) = 10 dBm
Table 25 summarizes these results.

###### 4.2.6.2.2.8 GSM picocell uplink with UMTS UE interference (Iext)
When the interference from UMTS UE is introduced, the required receive power
at GSM BS and the required transmit power of GSM MS at the cell edge is
Rx_required = (N~t~ + I~ext~) + M + SIR,
Where (_N~t~ + I~ext~_) in dBm is the sum of noise floor and the interference
caused by UMTS UE. The required transmit power of GSM MS is again calculated
as

##### 4.2.6.3.2 UMTS UE Tx power in GSM channel
The UE Tx power falling into the GSM Base Station (BS) receive channel can be
determined by the following equation:
UE Tx power in GSM channel = Indoor UE Tx power -- ACIR(âˆ†f) in dB (2)
where _âˆ†f_ denotes the center frequency spacing between UMTS and GSM carriers.
When the UMTS UEs interfere with GSM picocell, the ACIR is 31.3 dB for 2.8 MHz
center frequency separation and 43.3 dB for 4.8 MHz center frequency
separation. Table 29 shows the UE Tx power in GSM channel for various UE Tx
power percentiles and center frequency separations.

##### 4.2.6.3.3 UMTS UE interference level received by GSM picocell
It is assumed that the distance (_D_) between the interfering UMTS UE and
affected GSM picocell could be 3 m and 15 m. The associated UE to picocell
propagation losses based on the COST231 indoor model are 51.3 dB and 72.3 dB,
respectively. The GSM picocell received interference power (_I~ext~_) from
UMTS UE can be expressed as
I~ext~ = UMTS UE Tx power in GSM channel -- PL(D) in dB (3)
where PL is the path loss (including the propagation loss and antenna gains)
from UMTS UE to GSM picocell. Table 30 shows the UMTS UE interference power
received by GSM picocell for various UE Tx power percentiles, center frequency
separations and UE-to-picocell distances.

* * *
##### 4.2.6.3.4 Impact of UMTS UE interference on GSM picocell uplink
When the GSM uplink power control is activated and the UMTS UE interference is
present, GSM mobile needs to transmit more power to maintain the uplink SINR
target (_SINR_) in the GSM picocell receiver as long as the required mobile
transit power does not exceed the maximum power (33 dBm). Without UMTS UE
interference, the required Tx power of a GSM mobile at the picocell edge can
be determined by:
GSM_mobile_Tx_required = N~t~ + SINR + PL(D=50 m) + _M_ in dB (4)
where Nt denotes the GSM picocell receiver noise floor (-94 dBm/200 kHz),
PL(D=50 m) denotes the path loss (88.0 dB) for a 50 m distance between the GSM
picocell and the GSM mobile at the picocell edge, and M denotes the lognormal
fading and interference margin (10 dB). Consequently, in the absence of UMTS
UE interference, the GSM mobile power requirement is 10 dBm.
In the presence of UMTS UE interference, the required Tx power of a GSM mobile
at the picocell edge can be expressed as:
GSM_mobile_Tx_required = (N~t~ + I~ext~) + SINR + PL(D=50 m) + _M_ in dB (5)
where (Nt + Iext) in dBm is the linear sum of the GSM picocell noise floor and
the UMTS UE interference. Table 31 shows the required GSM mobile Tx power with
UMTS UE interference for various UE power percentiles, center frequency
separations and UE-to-picocell distances.

#### 4.2.6.4 Conclusion
The Interference from UMTS UE to GSM picocell BS has been analyzed with the
simulated outdoor UE Tx powers and indoor UE Tx power. Based on the analysis
results for the co-existence scenario 6 between UMTS macrocell and GSM
picocell, the following conclusions can be made
1) When UMTS UE is located at 15 m distance from GSM pico-BTS, the
interference from UMTS UE to GSM pico-BTS is lower than the GSM pico-BTS noise
floor hence the transmitting power of GSM MS located at cell edge is not
affected.
2) When UMTS UE is located at 3 m distance from GSM picro-BTS and the carrier
separation between UMTS and GSM is of 2.8 MHz, the transmitting power of GSM
MS at cell edge (50 m from pico-BTS) will be increased of a quantity between 0
and 7.7 dB depending on the interference caused by the UMTS UE transmitter.
However, the required GSM MS transmitting power stays still below the maximum
power and therefore it is considered that there is no call dropping in GSM
system caused by the interference from UMTS UE.
3) When UMTS UE is located at 3 m distance from GSM pico-BTS and the carrier
separation between UMTS and GSM is of 4.8 MHz, the transmitting power of GSM
MS at cell edge (50 m from pico-BTS) will be increased of a quantity between 0
and 1.2 dB depending on the interference caused by the UMTS UE transmitter. As
the interference is small and GSM transmitters have more than enough power
margin to compete against it is considered that there is no call dropping in
GSM system caused by the interference from UMTS UE.
4) UMTS UE spectrum mask allow a good co-existence between UMTS macrocell and
GSM picocell for the defined co-existence scenario hence there is no need to
harden the UMTS UE spectrum mask.
5) For ensuring a good co-existence between UMTS macrocells and GSM picocell,
it is recommended to have maximum separation between UMTS carrier and GSM
picocell carrier in order to minimize the possible interference from UMTS UE
to GSM picocellular BS.
### 4.2.7 Compatibility between GSM MCBTS and UMTS 900 systems
#### 4.2.7.1 Purpose of the investigation
Co-existence studies have been performed regarding the possible impact from
introduction of UMTS 900 allocated in an adjacent frequency range to GSM 900
systems. The results are well known and established in the European Community.
Recently 3GPP TSG GERAN has finalized the work on specifying Multicarrier BTS
(MCBTS) for GSM. To make the implementations feasible with wideband
multicarrier transmitter and receiver, relaxations of the requirements for IM
attenuation and inband spurious emissions in the transmitter and reduction of
blocking requirements in the receiver were introduced. The decision is based a
number of studies on the impacts of relaxations of the specifications for GSM
MCBTS on coexistence of public coordinated and uncoordinated GSM networks
operating in the same frequency band and the same geographical area. The
conclusion has been that there was no noticeable impact of the relaxations in
such scenarios.
The purpose of this study is to see what possible impact the relaxations of
the requirements for GSM MCBTS could have on
\- UMTS 900 system operating in adjacent channel in the same area due to
relaxed intermodulation attenuation and inband spurious emissions
\- The susceptibility of MCBTS receiver to UMTS900 system uplink emissions due
to reduced blocking characteristics.
#### 4.2.7.2 Impact on UMTS 900 downlink from MCBTS
##### 4.2.7.2.1 Principles used in the analysis
A simplified approach has been taken:
The emission spectrum from a UMTS BS with 43 dBm rated power into the adjacent
frequency band, where another UMTS 900 system is allocated, is calculated. The
ACLR according to the 3GPP specification is defined accordingly.
Then the UMTS BS is replaced by GSM MCBTS and the emission spectrum for
different number of active GSM carriers calculated by aggregating the spectrum
masks including IM products according to TS 45.005 v8.5.0. The carriers are
transmitting at 43 dBm each and are located with varying frequency spacing
(from minimum 600 kHz and upwards), giving IM products in the downlink of the
adjacent UMTS 900 system. The equivalent maximum emission is calculated within
the UMTS bandwidth, thus giving an upper limit of the ACLR from the GSM
system. The ACLR was derived in the same way as was done in TR 25.816 assuming
a 3.84 MHz "box filter".
This ACLR was calculated for one carrier (i.e. no IM products) up to 8
carriers. Both single-sided and double-sided (sandwiched) carrier
configurations are investigated (see figure 35A). Depending on the GSM
frequency spacing and allocation, the number of IM products that would fit
into the UMTS filter bandwidth will vary. All GSM carriers are assumed to be
served by the same MCPA, which is pessimistic in terms of IM emission.
Figure 35A: The figure shows the single- and double-sided scenarios, where the
smallest carrier separation between GSM and UMTS is varied (y), as well as GSM
carrier spacing (x).
One single carrier will result in an ACLR of 63.5 dB which differs from the
value derived from the GSM spectrum mask in TR 25.816 (55.2 dB). This
difference corresponds to a bandwidth conversion factor from 30 kHz to 200 kHz
and is believed to be the correct interpretation of TS 45.005. Note that the
ACLR is always relative one GSM carrier of 43 dBm.
To calculate the total impact ACIR the following formula is used:
{width="1.7402777777777778in" height="0.7201388888888889in"}
\- TFES-08-135 (MSG-09-
ACS GSM BS->UMTS UE is assumed to be 30.5 dB for carrier seperation 2.8 MHz
with an additional 0.8 dB receiver selectivity slope of for every 200 kHz, as
described in the assumptions in 3GPP TR 25.816.
##### 4.2.7.2.2 Results
IM emission levels are according to specification and are 200 kHz wide, with 3
dB attenuated emission into the adjacent 200 kHz channel for third-order IM.
For the fifth order IM, the emissions are attenuated 2 dB into the first
adjacent 200 kHz channel and further 3 dB into the second adjacent 200 kHz
channel.
Assuming a frequency separation between the last GSM carrier and the centre
frequency of the UMTS in adjacent band of 2.8 MHz (as used in TR 25.816 in the
uncoordinated case), the ACLR is calculated for different GSM carrier
separation and different number of carriers. It is assumed that the MCPA
intermodulation attenuation is designed for the number of carriers used in
each scenario.
For comparison the same calculations were also performed with no IM from GSM
present, which approximates the existing situation utilizing single carrier
BTS (SCBTS).
Using the method described above to calculate the ACLR , the following result
is achieved in UMTS channel, allocated 2.8 MHz from any GSM carrier:
* * *

and UMTS 2.8 MHz. Figure 35C: ACLR for double-sided carrier configurations. IM
levels according to specification. IM levels according to specification.
Smallest carrier separation between GSM and UMTS 2.8 MHz.
* * *
As can be seen in figures 35B and 35C, it is not the smallest GSM carrier
spacing that gives the highest levels of interference to the adjacent UMTS
carrier, which is due to different numbers of IM products in the UMTS
receiver. It should be noted that all ACLR values are above the UMTS
requirement of 45 dB.

reception with closest GSM carrier at frequency offset y=2.8 MHz, a slope for
the receiver selectivity performance of the UMTS UE according to the depicted
assumptions in 3GPP TR 25.816 has been assumed:
ACS(âˆ†f) = 30.5 dB + n * 0.8 dB with âˆ†f = 2.8 MHz + n * 200 kHz
{width="5.075in" height="3.80625in"}
Figure 35D: ACS for several carrier configurations, single- and double-sided
Figure 35F shows the combined UMTS UE ACS for the different carrier
configurations that are calculated according the formula above. It can be seen
that the sandwiched configuration leads to lower ACS performance than single-
sided configuration.
To estimate the corresponding ACIR values, it can be noted when comparing
figure 35B and 35C with figure 35D that the ACS values are about 20 dB lower
than the ACLR values. This means that ACS dominates ACIR and while ACLR still
has an effect on the results, it is not by much. Thus, the lowest ACIR values
occur when GSM carrier spacing is small. Table 31A shows ACIR for 600 kHz GSM
carrier separation.

It can be seen in the table that when replacing a SCBTS with a MCBTS, the
impact on ACIR is very small, class 1 less than 0.01 dB and class 2 less than
0.02 dB. If the more realistic IM emission levels are used, the degradation is
even smaller. The degradation is insignificant in the double-sided scenario
due to low combined ACS. Some of the carrier configurations, e.g. 2x2
carriers, do not give any IM3 products in the UMTS receiver filter, which is
why is there is no degradation.
A more realistic, though still pessimistic, frequency re-use is 1200 kHz
carrier spacing. The corresponding ACIR values can be seen in table 31B. The
table shows similar amounts of degradation as in the 600 kHz carrier spacing
scenario.

In both cases above the separation between the last GSM carrier and UMTS 900
centre frequency is 2.8 MHz. If 2.6 MHz is assumed, as recommended in [36] for
coordinated case, there will be a small difference for smaller carrier spacing
due to higher wideband noise from closest GSM carriers. This is exemplified in
figure 35E and 35F.

The corresponding ACIR table for 2.6 MHz carrier separation and 600 kHz
carrier spacing can be seen in table 31C. ACS has been calculated with the
same (log-) linear formula as before, with the addition of 30.5-0.8 dB ACS for
separation 2.6 MHz. It can be noticed that when comparing table 31C to table
31A, that all ACIR values has been decreased by 0.8 dB which reflects the fact
that all ACS values was decreased by 0.8. This scenario is very similar to 2.8
MHz in terms of degradation.

GSM spurious emissions have been omitted so far in the results above. A
simple, but very pessimistic approach would be to apply a minimum noise level
corresponding to the spurious emission levels. The resulting ACLR for the 2.8
MHz minimum carrier separation can be seen in figures 35G and 35H. When
comparing these figures to previous results in figures 2 and 3, it can be seen
that it is only the configurations with few carriers and small IM levels that
are affected and not more than 2 dB (for the single-carrier case). This has
minimal impact on ACIR.
The reason for this is that although spurious emissions requirements are
slightly relaxed (by changing the measurement method), they only exceed the
single-carrier wideband noise level by less than 4 dB for the output power
used in this analysis. This is a relatively small contribution of additional
interference, when IM is present or in the case of multiple GSM carriers.

In summary, considering the effect of the relaxed inband spurious emissions is
so small, the conclusion will still remain the same.
##### 4.2.7.2.3 Conclusion for MCBTS downlink
A heavily loaded MCBTS (class 1 or 2) would be very similar to a SCBTS, in
terms of interference to an adjacent UMTS system. This is because that the
unwanted emissions from MCBTS are orders of magnitude lower than the
interference generated in the UMTS UE, which is the same for both MCBTS and
SCBTS.
#### 4.2.7.3 Impact on MCBTS uplink from UMTS 900
The impact from UMTS UL on GSM UL has been investigated in 3GPP in the present
document and in [3], and also in ECC PT1 [36]. The conclusion from these
investigations is that the impact on GSM UL from UMTS UL is negligible for the
recommended minimum frequency separation distance between GSM carriers and
UMTS centre frequency for uncoordinated case (2.8 MHz). The critical impact
seems to be from the unwanted emissions from UMTS UE as the simulated UE TX
power is low. An example of power distribution in 900 MHz band from subclause
4.2.6.2.1 of the present document is shown in the figure below
{width="3.720833333333333in" height="2.9402777777777778in"}
Figure 35J: Power distribution of an UMTS terminal transmit power [dBm]
The curve is slightly adjusted compared to corresponding curve in subclause
4.2.6.2.1 to show the agreed average values at 50% and 90% percentiles.
Another way to describe the scenario situation is to calculate the probability
that there is a WCDMA terminal, operating near maximum power output, within
the MCL radius of the GSM BS communicating with a GSM UE at the cell boundary
is low. This is shown in [3] see figure below:
{width="5.772916666666666in" height="2.811111111111111in"}
Figure 35K: Probability that an UMTS terminal transmit power is greater than x
[dBm]
The above graphs are both assuming 21 dBm UE power which is the minimum
allowed for class 3 UE. Maximum UMTS UE TX power at 900 and 1800 is nominally
24 dBm for class 3.
In 3GPP RAN4 [2] the distribution of the input signals to the BS receivers in
mixed speech and data systems show the highest input signal levels. This is
shown for a large cell system (5 km cell radius) in the graphs below:
* * *
{width="2.8430555555555554in" height="1.3409722222222222in"}
{width="2.6256944444444446in" height="1.386111111111111in"}
Figure 35L: CDF of Total Signal for Mixed Speech and Data System with 5 km
Cells\ Figure 35M: CDF of Total Signal for Mixed Speech and Data System with 5
km Cells\ and Worst Case Geographic Offset and Worst Case Geographic Offset
* * *
These indicate that 99,99 % of occurrences of the input signals to the
receivers are about --40 dBm or less. Of course, with this large of a cell,
the absolute maximum signal is dictated by MCL also. Note that this analysis
assumes co-location of the UMTS base station and the MC BTS.
However, one may perform a simple analysis also for the scenario without co-
location. Even with the pessimistic assumption of 59 dB MCL (as defined in
45.050 for small-cell scenarios at 900 MHz) the maximum UE power reaching the
MCBTS receiver is less than -35 dBm. To this there is a very low probability
(\ 2 dB}
2) If we now consider Band III and assuming simple frequency scaling we can
consider the filter losses for the equivalent Band VIII (as the pass band and
Tx-Rx gap have a similar value after scaling) the sensitivity of WCDMA in the
Band VIII (UMTS 900) would be similar to Band III which is a 3dB delta
compared to Band I (UMTS 2100)
#### 4.5.1.3 Filter temperature shift
Filter temperature shift introduces a loss for the lower Rx band edge and the
upper Tx band edge. This is show below in figure 36.
{width="5.742361111111111in" height="2.9680555555555554in"}
Figure 36: Filter temperature Shift
Rx sensitivity performance has to be met for all operating frequencies; in
this case the sensitivity requirements must account for the effect of
temperature for the lowest and highest operating channels
#### 4.5.1.4 Filter flatness and impact on EVM / ISI
EVM is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform and measured
waveform. The measured waveform will be distorted due to any errors in
frequency, phase, amplitude and timing. As WCDMA is a wideband system the RF
channel filter distortion has to be maintained over a larger bandwidth. High
EVM in the Rx filter (ripple and group delay) will increase the Inter Symbol
Interference (ISI) and degrades the receiver sensitivity performance for those
5 MHz channels at the band edges.
For Band VIII a larger allocation of the ISI budget would be needed to be
allocated for the RF filter impact due to the smaller Tx -- Rx spacing. Impact
of temperature will also need to be accounted for in the ISI budget as it is
difficult to maintain this linearity for the band edge channels without
increasing the pass-band attenuation (Note similar issue for Tx EVM path).
These issues are captured in figure 37 below.
{width="5.470138888888889in" height="2.998611111111111in"}
Figure 37: Temperature Shift
#### 4.5.1.5 Available Filter performance
The sensitivity of a receiver is directly proportional to the insertion loss
in front of the LNA. The insertion loss is predominated by the receive filter.
Generally state of the art filter performance is determined by component
vendors. In this case requirements are usually a trade --off between
parameters for example
\- Rx pass band attenuation {impacts sensitivity}
\- Tx pass band attenuation [ impact Tx power, battery life}
\- Tx/Rx pass band ripple {impact EVM / ISI - sensitivity}
\- Tx/ Rx out of band attenuation {impact spurious emission, blocking spec ,
etc}
\- Filter return loss {impacts antenna matching , radiated performance}
\- Tx/ Rx filter temperature performance {impacts all parameters}
So filter which provide state of the art performance from one vendor in one
area may not necessarily provide a matching performance in other areas.
Additional losses also need to be factored in to account for other system
components such as isolator and switching devices needed for single and multi-
band terminal + RF components. Filter losses for the band I and VIII s are
captured below.
Table 31B
+-----------+--------------+--------------+--------------+------------+ | Operating | UL | DL | UE Rx | Rx Losses | | | Frequencies | Frequencies | sensitivity | | | Band | | | | (dB) | | | UE Tx Node B | UE Rx, Node | (dBm) | | | | Rx | B Tx (MHz) | | | | | | | | | | | (MHz) | | | | +-----------+--------------+--------------+--------------+------------+ | I | 1920 -- 1980 | 2110 -- 2170 | -117 | 2.0 -- 2.4 | +-----------+--------------+--------------+--------------+------------+ | VIII | 880 -- 915 | 925-960 | -114 | 4.5 -- 5.0 | +-----------+--------------+--------------+--------------+------------+
#### 4.5.1.6 Conclusion
Based on the issues raised in this document on the impact of
\- Rx Filter losses
\- Filter temperature shift
\- Filter flatness and impact on EVM /ISI
\- Available Filter performance
We propose the UE sensitivity requirements for Band VIII should be set at -114
dBm.
### 4.5.2 Impact on network coverage/capacity due to UE sensitivity
degradation
Two different approaches on the analysis of the possible impact on network
coverage/capacity are presented here. Due to the fact the analysis approaches
are different, the obtained results can be different as well. These two
analysis approaches can help operators to further analyse the possible impact
on UMTS900 network coverage/Capacity when planning the network.
The first analysis is based on static system simulation for a network
consisting of several cells and can be found in section 4.5.2.1, The second
analysis is based on link budget analysis of a single cell and can be found in
section 4.5.2.2.
#### 4.5.2.1 Analysis of UE reference sensitivity impact on system capacity
This section is dedicated to the analysis of the impact of UE reference
sensitivity to the WCDMA900 network coverage and capacity in the rural
scenario 4.
Scenario 4: UMTS macro vs UMTS macro, in rural environment, uncoordinated
##### 4.5.2.1.1 Analysis
In order to understand the impact of UE reference sensitivity to the system
coverage/capacity the Scenario 4 simulation was done with single operator
only, which represents the most critical scenario from the UE reference
sensitivity point of view as the amount of interference is the lowest. UE
reference sensitivity of -114dBm DPCH_Ec was used and the system was loaded to
the full capacity and after that the CPICH power of the each user was
recorded. Note that the number of users in the system does not have any impact
on the common channel received signal power but the users were introduced into
the simulation to monitor the signal levels in the network. The more users
there are the more reliable are the results as the statistics cover the whole
network area. The CPICH_RSCP distribution is shown below:
{width="6.64375in" height="2.1944444444444446in"}
Figure 38 CPICH_RSCP in rural scenario 4, PDF and CDF
As can be seen from the figure 38 the probability that the CPICH_RSCP is below
-75dBm is 1%.
In order to understand the signal powers for the UEs that are located indoors
an IPF of 15dB can be used as agreed in scenario 6 assumptions [3]. The
probability that the CPICH_RSCP for an indoor user is lower than -75dBm-15dB=
-90dBm is hence 1%. The CPICH_RSCP power in the UE reference sensitivity
requirement is 7dB above the DPCH_Ec hence if DPCH_Ec is -114dBm the
CPICH_RSCP is -107dBm that is 17dB lower than the lowest CPICH_RSCP power seen
by any user in the scenario 4 even if 15dB IPF is assumed.

In order to quantify the impact of UE noise figure to the system performance
the level of other cell pilots was also recorded. The **other-cell pilot power
distribution** is shown below:
{width="6.263888888888889in" height="2.213888888888889in"}
Figure 39: Received other cell pilot power in rural scenario 4, PDF and CDF
The other-cell pilot powers are in 99% of cases above -70dBm. The received
other-cell pilot powers were recorded in order to understand the signal powers
in the empty system as a fully loaded system is in most cases interference
limited, however in this case the other-cell interference of the pilots alone
is significantly higher than UE noise floor. Assuming 15dB IPF the other-cell
pilot power for user located indoors is in 99% of cases above -70dBm-15dB=
-85dBm.
The total interference in the UE receiver is the sum of the intra-frequency
interference, inter-frequency/system interference (here equal to zero) and UE
noise floor. The total interference power in the 99% point with UE reference
sensitivity of -117dBm DPCH_Ec and -114dBm DPCH_Ec is calculated below:
{width="3.998611111111111in" height="1.5715277777777779in"}
Figure 39B
As can be seen from the calculation above the impact of 3dB higher UE noise
figure is only 0.2dB hence the UE reference sensitivity of -114dBm has
negligible impact on the system coverage/capacity or HSDPA bit rates in the
analyzed scenario.
##### 4.5.2.1.2 Discussion
In this section the impact of UE reference sensitivity of -114dBm DPCH_Ec to
the system coverage/capacity in rural scenario 4 has been analyzed. As the
other-cell pilot powers in the system are high also indoors the 3dB higher UE
NF, when compared to core band, has negligible impact on the system capacity.
#### 4.5.2.2 Possible impact on network coverage/capacity due to UE
sensitivity degradation
##### 4.5.2.2.1 UE sensitivity and downlink noise floor
Due to the small minimum gap of 10 MHz between uplink and downlink blocks, the
duplexer filter loss is more important, UMTS900 UE sensitivity has to be
degraded compared to the band I (2 GHz) UE sensitivity.
The impact of UE sensitivity degradation on UMTS900 network coverage and
capacity should be analyzed. The table 33 below gives the UE sensitivity
levels and the related downlink noise floor.

##### 4.5.2.2.2 Analysis of impact on UMTS900 network coverage
UMTS is a WCDMA multi-service (multiple data rates) system. Two important
characteristics of the WCDMA system are
i) Coverage and capacity are closely correlated
ii) Uplink and downlink coverage/capacity can be different.
For a given service (data rate), uplink coverage is dependent of UE Tx power
and BS sensitivity, uplink capacity is function of BS receiver performance
(Noise figure, Eb/No). Downlink coverage is usually defined as the downlink
pilot target Ec/I~0~., the pilot power allocation is a parameter to set.
Downlink coverage depends BS Tx power and UE sensitivity, when UE sensitivity
is degraded, for keeping the same downlink pilot coverage, more power should
be allocated to pilot and other common channels. In consequence, less BS Tx
power will be available to traffic channel, also the downlink traffic power
consuming for a UE with degraded sensitivity will be higher, that means
downlink capacity becomes smaller when UE sensitivity is degraded.
Usually a WCDMA network is designed with a 50% cell loading. The coverage and
capacity at such cell loading are considered as the nominal network coverage
and capacity. It is well known that WCDMA network is uplink limited in
coverage, and downlink limited in capacity. It can be reasonably considered
that downlink noise floor increase will not affect the uplink coverage. The
impact on downlink coverage can be adjusted by power allocation parameter
setting, the impact of downlink noise floor increase (UE sensitivity
degradation) will affect only downlink capacity (throughput).
##### 4.5.2.2.3 Analysis of impact on UMTS900 network capacity
##### 4.5.2.2.3.1 Rural area large cell size {#rural-area-large-cell-size .H6}
As stated in section 3, UMTS cell size is uplink limited, it is determined on
uplink calculation. The cell size calculation depend many parameters, for a
given cell reliability and a given set of system and network parameters, the
cell sizes for different services (uplink data rates) are different. A typical
cell size is calculated for CS64 service with 90% of cell area reliability, in
rural area with BS antenna height of 40 m, with a 10 dB indoor penetration
loss, the uplink allowable pathloss is estimated with a uplink link budget
tool as 136.5 dB, the uplink cell range is estimated as 5 km.
{width="3.4055555555555554in" height="2.1625in"}
Figure 40: Cell size is determined by uplink allowable pathloss
In order to maintain the same cell size in downlink, the downlink pathloss is
related to the uplink pathloss,
DL Pathloss = UL Pathloss + df (1)
Where df is the additional downlink pathloss, such as propagation loss
difference due to the difference of downlink and uplink frequencies, insertion
loss, etc.
When downlink noise floor is higher, the power allocated to common channels
(Pilot, P-CCPCH, S-CCPCH, PICH, etc) should be increased, the available power
for traffic channel becomes less, and the power consummation per traffic
channel is also higher, the consequence is that the downlink capacity
(throughput) will be reduced.
Under the assumption of a BS Tx power = 43 dBm, the calculated downlink PS384
capacity (throughput in kbps) losses for several pathloss values as function
of downlink noise floor (dBm) are plotted in figure 41. It can be seen that
a) For pathloss = 140 dB, downlink PS384 capacity (averaged cell throughput in
kbps) loss increases about 5% with 1 dB downlink noise floor increase, the
downlink PS384 capacity (averaged cell throughput in kbps) loss is 17.5% for 3
dB downlink noise floor increase.
b) For pathloss = 136.5 dB (5 km cell range), downlink PS384 capacity
(averaged cell throughput in kbps) loss increases about 2.5% with 1 dB
downlink noise floor increase, the downlink PS384 capacity (averaged cell
throughput in kbps) loss is 9% for 3 dB downlink noise floor increase.
c) For pathloss = 130 dB, downlink PS384 capacity (averaged cell throughput in
kbps) loss increases about 0.7% with 1 dB downlink noise floor increase, the
downlink PS384 capacity (averaged cell throughput in kbps) loss is 2.2% for 3
dB downlink noise floor increase.
d) For pathloss = 120 dB, downlink PS384 capacity (averaged cell throughput in
kbps) loss increases 0.1% with 1 dB downlink noise floor increase, the
downlink PS384 capacity (averaged cell throughput in kbps) loss is 0.2% for 3
dB downlink noise floor increase.

##### 4.5.2.2.3.2 Urban area small cell size with indoor mobiles {#urban-area-
small-cell-size-with-indoor-mobiles .H6}
In urban area, UMTS900 can be deployed for offering deep indoor coverage. The
impact on UMTS900 downlink capacity loss in urban area can be estimated in the
similar way. Under the assumption of dense urban environment, with BS antenna
height of 30m, BS antenna gain of 15 dBi, 21 dB indoor penetration factor
(IPF), the uplink budget gives a allowable pathloss of 123 dB for the service
CS64, the cell range is estimated as 816 m.
{width="4.916666666666667in" height="3.1354166666666665in"}
Figure 42: DL capacity (throughput in kbps) loss (%) in function of DL noise
floor (Urban area)
For maintaining the same cell range on downlink, under the assumption of a BS
Tx power = 43 dBm, the calculated downlink PS384 capacity (throughput in kbps)
losses for the pathloss of 123 dB with IPF=21 dB as function of downlink noise
floor (dBm) are plotted in figure 42. It can be seen that for this indoor
coverage case with pathloss of 123 dB, indoor penetration factor of 21 dB,
downlink PS384 capacity (averaged cell throughput in kbps) loss increases
about 3% with 1 dB downlink noise floor increase, the downlink PS384 capacity
(averaged cell throughput in kbps) loss is 9.7% for 3 dB downlink noise floor
increase.
##### 4.5.2.2.4 Discussion
UMTS900 UE sensitivity degradation will impact more network downlink capacity
(throughput) rather than network coverage, since WCDMA network coverage
limiting factor is uplink. Downlink common channel coverage is adjusted by the
Tx power setting.
Cell average downlink capacity loss due to downlink noise floor (UE
sensitivity) increase depends allowable pathloss, plus indoor penetration
factor, that means cell size in rural area, and indoor penetration factor in
urban area. For large cell size in rural area or large indoor penetration
factor in urban area, the cell average downlink capacity loss becomes more
important than that for small cell size in rural area or small indoor
penetration factor in urban area.
Similar to PS384 service, when HSDPA is implemented in the network, the impact
on HSDPA coverage/capacity could be
a) Due to UE sensitivity degradation, for maintaining the same coverage, the
power allocated to common channels has to be increased, this will makes less
power for HSDPA data traffic channel, the downlink throughput will be reduced
accordingly.
b) Increase of HS-SCCH part will also reduce in consequence the power for HS-
DSCH.
c) At cell border, when noise becomes comparable to extra-cell interferences,
the downlink throughput will be reduced.
## 4.6 Specific UE requirements for UMTS900
### 4.6.1 Proposed Transmitter Characteristics
Based on the co-existence studies between UMTS and UMTS operating in 900 MHz
band and the co-existence studies between UMTS and GSM operating in 900 MHz
band described in section 4.2, the analysis of the simulation results for the
defined co-existence scenarios indicate that there is no need to define more
severe or additional requirements for the UMTS900 UE transmitter
characteristics in terms of spectrum mask and ALCR.
**UE Tx power classes**
By considering that
i) The duplex distance between uplink block and downlink block is only 45 MHz;
ii) Minimum gap between uplink block and downlink block is only 10 MHz;
iii) The UMTS900 UE could be multi-mode (UMTS and GSM) or multi-band UE
It is considered as useful and necessary to define an additional UE Tx Power
class 3bis at Tx power at + 23 dBm with measurement tolerance +2/-2 dB. Three
UE Tx power classes are defined for UMTS900 UE: Power Class 3, Power Class
3bis, and Power Class 4.
Table 6.1: UE Power Classes
Operating Band | Power Class 1 | Power Class 2 | Power Class 3 | Power Class 3bis | Power Class 4 |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| **Power** **(dBm)** | **Tol** **(dB)** | **Power** **(dBm)** | **Tol** **(dB)** | **Power** **(dBm)** | **Tol** **(dB)** | **Power** **(dBm)** | **Tol** **(dB)** | **Power** **(dBm)** | **Tol** **(dB)**

Band II | - | - | - | - | +24 | +1/-3 | - | - | +21 | +2/-2  
Band III | - | - | - | - | +24 | +1/-3 | - | - | +21 | +2/-2  
Band IV | - | - | - | - | +24 | +1/-3 | - | - | +21 | +2/-2  
Band V | - | - | - | - | +24 | +1/-3 | - | - | +21 | +2/-2  
Band VI | - | - | - | - | +24 | +1/-3 | - | - | +21 | +2/-2  
Band VII | - | - | - | - | +24 | +1/-3 | +23 | +2/-2 | +21 | +2/-2  
Band VIII | - | - | - | - | +24 | +1/-3 | +23 | +2/-2 | +21 | +2/-2  
**Spectrum emission mask**
The proposed RF output spectrum mask for the band VIII (900 MHz) is the same
as for other frequency bands (I, II, III, IV, V, VII).
**Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)**
The proposed ACLR for UMTS900 UE is also the same as for other frequency
bands, the ACLR values are given in the table 6.11 of TS25.101 as minimum
requirement.
Table 6.11: UE ACLR
* * *
Power Class Adjacent channel frequency relative to assigned channel frequency
ACLR limit 3 + 5 MHz or -- 5 MHz 33 dB 3 + 10 MHz or -- 10 MHz 43 dB 4 + 5 MHz
or -- 5 MHz 33 dB 4 + 10 MHz or --10 MHz 43 dB
* * *
**Spurious emissions**
The general spurious emission requirements for the band VIII UE are the same
as for other bands.
The additional spurious emissions levels are defined in the table 6.13 of
TS25.101, these additional spurious emission levels are defined for the
protection of the BS and UE of other radio systems. By considering that there
will be both GSM and UMTS systems operating in this 900 MHz band, the
protection for GSM BS and MS and for UMTS BS and UE are not the same. The
measurement bandwidth for the additional spurious emissions for the protection
of GSM and UMTS are not the same either. For the frequency range 925-935 MHz,
the required spurious emission level for the protection of GSM downlink was
defined as -67 dBm/100 kHz, the required spurious emission level for the
protection of UMTS downlink is defined as -60 dBm/3.84 MHz. These requirements
need to be added to the frequency band I (2100 MHz) and III (1800 MHz). Both
requirements should be fulfilled. These two requirements for the frequency
range 925-935 MHz are also defined for the band VIII (900 MHz). In addition,
spurious requirements for the protection of the downlink of GSM900, UMTS900,
GSM1800, UMTS1800, UMTS2100, UMTS2600 are defined and added to the table 6.13.

**Receiver blocking requirements**
UMTS900 UE receiver in-band blocking and out of band blocking requirements are
defined in the similar way as for other bands. The band VIII is to be added to
the tables 7.6 and 7.7 of TS25.101.

# 6 Conclusion
In this UMTS900 work item technical report TR25.816, all of the work related
to the development of UMTS900 technical specifications is described.
Chapter 4 has been dedicated to the studies of the RF requirements, the
UMTS900 network deployment and the co-existence simulations scenarios were
listed, the simulation assumptions and simulation results for each of the
defined co-existence scenarios were described. Based on the analysis of
simulation results, the RF requirements were derived.
The changes to different technical specifications (TS25.104, TS25.101,
TS25.141, TS25.133, TS25.113, TS34.124, TS25.461) have be summarized in the
Chapter 5.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Intermodulation characteristics
# A.1 Intermodulation Attenuation physics
Due to non-linearity in the transmitter, intermodulation products are
generated when several signals are processed in a common active element. For
MCBTS the Multi-Carrier Power Amplifier is the dominating source of IM
products. The transfer function for n signals can in general be presented by a
series of powers, i.e. for n input signals
S~out~ = Î£{a~k~âˆ™(S~1~+S~2~....S~n~)^k^}
The value of k represents the order of intermodulation as this describes the
number of signals involved in the process. In this calculation multiples of
the same carrier signals are included as well. For GSM only odd orders (3^rd^,
5^th^, 7^th^ etc) may fall inside GSM transmit or receive bands. Normally the
factor a~k~ is decreasing rapidly with the IM order. Thus the most important
IM products to consider are 3^rd^, 5^th^ and 7^th^ order.
Third order IM products from n carriers may be found at
> \|2âˆ™f~i~-f~j~\|, \|2âˆ™f~j~-f~i~\| but also on \|f~i~+f~j~-f~k~\|,
> \|f~i~+f~k~-f~j~\| etc
for any combination of i, j and k in the range 1 to n and where f~i~ is the
centre frequency for carrier i.
These products can be found for offsets up to \| f~1~-f~n~\| outside the group
of carriers. Another characteristic for these products is the broadening of
spectrum. Assuming GMSK signals and 200 kHz channels, the IM products will
occur at the adjacent channels as well, it can be shown theoretically that in
these channels the power will be 3 dB lower. Other modulation methods used by
GSM systems will result in further attenuation at adjacent channels.
Similarly, the 5^th^ order IM products may be found at
\|3âˆ™f~i~-2âˆ™f~j~\|, \|3âˆ™f~j~-2âˆ™f~i~\| but also on
\|f~i~+f~j~+f~k~-(f~a~+f~b~)\|, \| f~i~+f~a~+f~k~-(f~j~+f~b~)\| etc
for any combination of i, j, k, a and b in the range 1 to n and where f~i~ is
the centre frequency for carrier i.
These products may be found for offsets up to 2âˆ™\| f~1~-f~n~\| outside the
group of carriers. For this case the spectrum broadening is higher; the power
is 2 -- 2.5 dB lower in the adjacent channels.
It should be noted that if the carriers are equally spaced in frequency
several IM3 and several IM5 (or higher order) products will coincide on the
same frequencies and add up, thus creating the maximum amplitude of the IM
products. This means that the IM products with highest amplitude are closest
to the carriers and that the others are decreasing by increasing offset.
An example of IM spectrum with 3 equally spaced carriers with equal power is
shown in Figure A.1.
{width="6.051388888888889in" height="4.072916666666667in"}
Figure A.1 Example of IM spectrum for 3 GSM carriers
In this figure the 3^rd^ order intermodulation products are found between 0
and 15 MHz, i.e. at 2.5 and 5 MHz offsets on both sides of the outermost
carriers. The IM products outside this range are primarily related to 5^th^
order intermodulation.
Reduction of the number of active carriers, while keeping the same output
power for the active ones, thus means that the IM3 is reduced rapidly as the
factor a~3~ is the same and fewer products add up.
How these different products are defined and adding up in different
allocations are described in [37]. This is pure theoretical analysis of a
power amplifier with low non-linearity. No specific implementation is assumed.
# A.2 Application to MCBTS
In the 3GPP specification the requirements are defined at equal frequency
spacing and equal power, thus limiting the IM products with highest amplitude
to a specified value:
> MCBTS class 1: -70 dBc relative the carrier power for any intermodulation
> product.
>
> MCBTS class 2: same as class 1 but allow for -60 dBc at frequencies where
> third order intermodulation products can be expected.
For the present analysis of the impact due to MCBTS unwanted emissions the IM
performance requirements according to 3GPP TS 45.005, as depicted above, have
been assumed as this represents a worst case assumption.
The methodology in [37] may be useful to further estimate the impact from IM
products especially when the frequency allocation changes dynamically and the
carriers are no longer equally spaced.
