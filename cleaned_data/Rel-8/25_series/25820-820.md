# 4 General
As agreed in the study item proposal [1]:
"Within the course of increasing UMTS terminal penetration and fixed-mobile
convergence, an upcoming demand for 3G Home NodeBs to provide attractive
services and data rates in home environments is observed.
UTRAN is not optimal suited for this application as UTRAN was developed and
defined under the assumption of coordinated network deployment whereas home
NodeBs are typically associated with uncoordinated and large scale deployment.
Aim of this feasibility study is to investigate optimization and amendments to
the UTRAN standard in order to fully support the application of Home NodeBs.
The scope of this study item is limited to FDD mode.
This study includes but is not limited to the architecture aspect, handover
scenarios and interference considerations.
In order to minimize the impact on the existing overall network, the home
NodeB concept for WCDMA shall operate with legacy terminals (from Release 99
onwards) and core network and minimize impact on UTRAN interfaces. No impact
to terminal specifications is foreseen.
Once the feasibility study is finalized, an optimised solution for the 3G Home
NodeB environment should be available.
Work for the LTE home eNodeB (as part of the on-going LTE work item) should
benefit from the scenarios defined as part of this study. The intention is to
base the interference analysis on the same scenario for both UTRAN and EUTRAN
as the deployment scenarios are expected to be the same."
## 4.1 Task description
The purpose of this study item is to characterise the 3G Home NodeB
environment and investigate the feasibility of optimisations and amendments to
UTRAN FDD mode to adapt it to fully support the 3G Home NodeB.

# 5 RF Aspects (RAN WG4)
## 5.1 Requirements
RF Requirements for Home (e)NodeBs will be the same as for the local area
(e)NodeB, with additional requirements as described in the following sections.
### 5.1.1 New Requirements Affecting RF Aspects
1) Home (e)NodeBs should not degrade significantly the performance of networks
deployed in other channels.
2) Home (e)NodeB configurations intended for deployment in the _same_ channel
as an existing (e)UTRAN network should ensure their combined performance is
not significantly worse than that of the original network.
3) Home (e)NodeBs should provide reasonable performance whether deployed in
isolation or whether multiple Home (e)NodeBs are deployed in the same area.
4) As a Home (e)NodeBs may be privately owned and portable, it shall only
radiate while it is confirmed that such an emission complies with regulatory
requirements in force where that Home NodeB is operating.
5) The Home NodeB must support UE speeds up to 30 km/h.
6) Home NodeB must support existing UTRAN UEs.
### 5.1.2 RF Requirements analysis
1) _Adjacent_ channel co-existence should be considered as this is the worst
case.
1 & 2) Performance is quantified in terms of UE throughput, coverage and
spectral efficiency, taking into account cell edge, average UE and close to
the HNB.
2) This requirement is only applicable if it is deemed feasible to deploy HNBs
in the same channel as an existing network.
Combined performance is equal to the addition of macro network and the HNB
network taking into account the open/closed access configuration.
3) Home NodeBs should provide a minimum level of performance, even when many
are deployed near to each other, as would be the case in a housing estate.
Furthermore, any interference mitigation techniques used to meet requirements
1 and 2 should do so without significantly compromising the performance of the
Home NodeB. For example, a simple mechanism could switch off the Home NodeB
when it causes interference. However, the Home NodeB itself would then be of
no value.
Performance is quantified in terms of UE throughput, coverage, and spectral
efficiency, taking into account cell edge and average UE. HNB system
requirements are currently discussed in SA1, as illustrated by [119];
performance requirements will align with the outcome of this work.
4) Radiation in licensed spectrum requires authorization from the license
holder (i.e. an operator), who in turn is responsible for ensuring that
emissions comply with the associated regulatory requirements. One key issue
here is how the operator will verify that the HNB is in the geographical
region specified in their license. Whilst it is clear that a procedure is
needed to support this requirement, it is considered to be beyond the scope of
RAN WG4 to define it. Currently RAN4 assumes that the following aspects would
need to be taken into account:
  * HNB location
  * communication link between HNB and HNB operator
  * HNB identity.
  * other FFS
The events and frequency on which the above conditions must be verified is an
open issue.
HNB location:
  * HNB must be within operator's license area when transmitting on the > radio path.
  * A more precise location may be required for other reasons, such as: > emergency services, lawful interception, or restricting operation > to a specific location (open issue)
Communication link between HNB and HNB operator:
  * There must be a communication link to receive authorisation
  * The communication link may need to achieve minimum performance > requirements for offered services (open issue)
HNB identity:
  * The HNB operator must be able to verify the HNB identity
5) Discussions in [5,6,7,8,] have demonstrated that the need to support UE
speeds greater than 30 km/h is extremely unlikely. Further reductions in
supported speed may be possible, but are not critical, since a limit of 30
km/h represents a significant and useful reduction from the current local area
specification.
6) HNB must be backwards compatible with UTRAN UEs already in the field.
Note. The support of UE location for emergency calls is being handled by other
3GPP groups and is not believed to impact RAN WG4.
## 5.2 Deployment Configurations
A number of different deployment configurations have been considered for Home
(e)NodeB. The aspects which define these are as follows:
  * Open access or CSG (Closed Subscriber Group)
    * Open access HNBs can serve any UE in the same way as a normal NodeB
    * CSG HNBs only serve UEs which are a member of a particular Closed Subscriber Group
  * Dedicated channel or co-channel
    * Whether HNBs operate in their own separate channel, or whether they share a channel with an existing (e)UTRAN network
  * Fixed or adaptive (DL) maximum transmit power
    * Fixed: HNBs have a set fixed maximum transmit power
    * Adaptive: HNB's sense interference to existing networks, and adjust maximum transmit power accordingly
The following configurations are considered and are described in more detail
in the following sections.
> A. CSG, Dedicated channel, Fixed Power
>
> B. CSG, Dedicated channel, Adaptive Power
>
> C. CSG, Co-channel, Adaptive Power
>
> D. Partial Co-Channel
>
> E. Open Access, dedicated or co-channel
### 5.2.1 Configuration A. CSG, Dedicated Channel, Fixed Power
HNB is configured as a Closed Subscriber Group. Access to HNB is controlled
through an arrangement between the HNB owner and by the network operator.
Access is restricted to a very limited number of UE; the majority of UE do not
have access to the HNB. Therefore, a CSG covers the partially open system, as
discussed in [89].
The HNB is deployed on a dedicated channel; i.e. a channel that is not used
within the macro layer. The worst case dedicated channel deployment is the
adjacent channel. The worst case adjacent channel deployment is when the
adjacent channel is owned by a different operator.
Although the HNB is deployed on the dedicated frequency with respect to the
macro network, a co-channel interference scenario remains between HNB's. HNB's
must share the same frequency, hence co-channel coexistence must be analysed
within a dense population of HNB.
In this configuration, the Home NodeB's maximum transmit power could
potentially be fixed by the operator to be lower than the Maximum Transmit
power capability. As analysed in detail in [63], the reduced power limit
ensures the dominance of the HNB with respect to a macro cell is appropriately
bounded. Therefore, the HNB cell size is limited with respect to a weak macro
signal. Consequently, the HNB can operate with a fixed maximum power level
even at the edge of a macro cell.
### 5.2.2 Configuration B. CSG, Dedicated Channel, Adaptive Power
HNB is configured as a Closed Subscriber Group.
The HNB is deployed on a dedicated channel.
Maximum transmit power may be set as high as the maximum capability of the HNB
class of basestation. However, higher maximum power level than the acceptable
"fixed" maximum power for dedicated channel deployment, Section shall only be
used when appropriate for the deployed environment, and when the resulting
interference is acceptable.
### 5.2.3 Configuration C. CSG Co-channel, Adaptive Power
HNB is configured as a Closed Subscriber Group.
The HNB is deployed on the same channel as the macro network. This is
considered the worst case interference scenario; consequently this is the
highest risk deployment. Power levels used by the Home Node B and all attached
UE's must be set as appropriate for the deployed environment.
The fixed maximum transmit power limit is not considered feasible for co-
channel deployment and has been removed from further analysis.
### 5.2.4 Configuration D. Partial Co-Channel
Partial co-channel is proposed for CSG operation for HNBs. This works by
limiting frequencies which are shared by the "macro layer" and the HNB, as
shown in Figure 1. The macro layer uses the all available frequencies, whereas
the home NodeB only uses a subset -- the shared part. Macro UEs can operate on
any frequency. Macro UEs in the shared part experiencing "pathological"
interference from home NodeBs can move to the clear part.
Whist this configuration is indented as a solution for CSG operation, it may
also be applicable to Open access in order to limit the influence of the HNB
in the overall network and allow more control over mobility.

Figure 1. Spectrum arrangement for Macro and Home Node Bs
Figure 2 shows how this could be implemented in UTRAN. Two channels are
needed, one for Macro+HNB, the other for Macro only. Macro-only UEs
experiencing HNB interference in channel 1 would handover to channel 2.
{width="3.6166666666666667in" height="1.4652777777777777in"}
Figure 2. Spectrum arrangement for UTRAN
Figure 3 shows how this could be implemented for EUTRAN. Since it has scalable
bandwidth, it does not necessarily require two channels as with UTRAN.
Provided the HENB sub-band does not overlap the central 6 RBs of the macro's
channel, then it will not prevent UEs receiving the BCH and SCH and connecting
to the macro layer. Frequency hopping and Frequency dependent scheduling will
ensure UEs experiencing HNB interference on part of the band will still be
able to function.

Figure 3. **Spectrum arrangement for EUTRAN**
Providing UEs hand over to the clear channel when experiencing HNB
interference , the performance of this configuration should be similar to that
of configuration A (dedicated channel, fixed power)
### 5.2.5 Configuration E: Open Access, dedicated or co-channel
Open access Home NodeBs serve all UEs, in the same way as other NodeBs do
[33,34,55].
The results referenced in Section explain the level of openness supported by a
HNB deployment when explaining the model and assumptions used.
A completely open system is already covered by the existing classes of Node B.
## 5.3 Interference Scenarios
Home Node B's are intended to enhance the coverage of a UMTS Radio Access
Network in the home environment. However, it is not feasible to completely
control the deployment of the HNB layer within the UMTS RAN. Therefore,
interference due to the HNB is a concern and interference mitigation
techniques may be required. Interference mitigation techniques will impact the
HNB performance, which will present the HNB with challenges in managing its
radio resources and maintaining Quality of Service to its attached users. In
the following sections the interference scenarios that exist between a HNB and
the macro layer, and among HNBs, are discussed in more detail.
Priority of the interference scenario investigations has been established as
shown in Table 1
Table 1. Interference Scenarios

In addition to the above scenarios, we also addressed the scenario of a HNB
mobile operating very close to its serving HNB, simulation results are
referred to in Section .
Additionally, possible methods for assessing HNB performance in the different
interference scenarios were proposed in [102].
### 5.3.1 Coexistence Simulation Parameters
Simulation results are encouraged from a range of parameters to ensure a
robust and diverse analysis of the problem. The results in this section were
generated over a range of simulation assumptions. Simulation models are
described for different HNB deployment scenarios in [50, 55, 57, 63,
88].Models for the dense urban apartment building, HNB-Macro are provided in
[57] and [103].
### 5.3.2 Interference scenario 1 UL HNB UE  Macro
Noise rise on the macro layer will significantly reduce macro performance;
consequently, the transmit power of the UE should be controlled. The following
mechanisms are investigated to limit the interference cause by an HNB attached
UE:
  * HNB receiver performance will have an impact on UE transmit power; therefore any relaxation of the BS receiver required must be carefully investigated.
  * UE power limitations such as maximum transmit power limits, and strict scheduling limits and noise rise limitation for HSUPA
  * Open access; UEs are permitted to move easily between the macro and HNB layers, thereby ensuring each uplink connection requires the least amount of UE transmit power and generates the least amount of interference [55].

### 5.3.3 Interference scenario 2 DL HNB  Macro UE
In a CSG, downlink interference from an HNB will result in coverage holes in
the macro network. In co-channel deployment the coverage holes are
considerably more significant than when the HNB is deployed on a separate
carrier. Several mechanisms are considered to reduce the impact of the macro
coverage:
  * fixed HNB transmit power. (this is only applicable to dedicated channel deployment)
  * control of HNB behaviour with respect to setting its maximum transmit power
  * open access systems.
Deployment scenario C reduces the impact on the macro layer by automatically
adjusting the HNB transmit power. The algorithm used to control the HNB
transmission power will be left as an implementation detail; consequently a
variety of models are explored when setting the HNB transmission power. Some
options are as follows:
• In [63], the maximum output power for each HNB is set based on a fixed limit
in the "dead zone" (out-of-coverage area) that would be caused by any adjacent
channel macro UE.
• In [50], the transmit power for each HNB is set based on the inverted power
control scheme used for macro/macro coexistence simulation (power control set
1, power control set 2)
• In [55], the average transmit power for both the HNB and the macro are
balanced at the HNB cell edge.
Deployment scenario B, where the HNB output power is controlled and the HNB's
are deployed on an adjacent carrier to the macro layer, is shown to be of
limited use [64], since the reduced power limit of Deployment Scenario A is
adequate for coverage of the majority of homes. An increase in power may be
desirable when a large coverage area is desired, or when coverage within the
home is difficult. However, when the density of HNB is very high, inter-HNB
interference dominates, and an increase in HNB power beyond Deployment
scenario A does not result in performance gains.
Open access provides an alternative solution, as illustrated in [34] and [55].
When specifying HNB behaviour, it is the goal of this study item to avoid any
RAN1 impact if possible. If possible, RAN4 will determine the framework to
allow a range of implementation to set the maximum transmit power. For
example, a framework may consist of requirements and tests for a suitable
target power level, but will not specify the algorithm.
It is acknowledge that no single mechanism alone provides a definitive
solution. Any solution will likely involve a combination of methods, and will
certainly have to reach a suitable compromise between macro layer and HNB
layer performance.

### 5.3.4 Interference scenario 3 UL Macro UE  HNB
As described in interference scenario 1, the HNB attached UE is constrained in
its transmit power. Consequently, the HNB attached UE is especially
susceptible to interference from the macro UE. The HNB receiver must reach a
compromise between protecting itself against uncoordinated interference from
the macro UEs, while controlling the interference caused by its own UE's
towards the macro layer.

### 6.1.4 Cell Reselection using HCS
Hierarchical Cell Structure (HCS) can be used as an additional means of better
distinguishing between Home NodeB cells and macro cells. It allows different
cell reselection rules and thus more flexibility:
  * UEs can measure for Home NodeB cells even when UE is in good macro coverage, still limiting the measurement burden on those UEs, as only either High priority cells or Low priority cells need to be considered.
```{=html}
``` \- The number of unwanted UEs selecting to Home NodeB, and thus doing
mobility management signalling, can be limited, by two methods:
    -   Using the HCS penalty timer. It can be used to avoid selecting
        to a certain cell for the duration of the timer. UE has to
        measure Q \> Qhcs for the duration of the timer to stop using
        the penalty offset. Thus it can be avoided that passing-by UEs
        select to this cell.
    -   Parameters for \"high mobility\" can be set so most moving UEs
        would select to macro cells, and only UEs that are quite
        stationary would use the Home NodeB layer.
**Pros:** Same as previous chapter:
**Cons:** Same as previous chapter, except that the negative impact on UE
battery consumption and mobility management signalling can be less severe, as
the number of UEs measuring on and selecting to the Home Node B can be
reduced.
### 6.1.5 Separate Home NodeB PLMN ID
#### 6.1.5.1 General
Home NodeB Cells would have a separate PLMN ID different from the PLMN ID of
the macro cells.
Assignment of the separate PLMN ID has the following benefits and drawback
regardless if enhanced with one of the other configurations:
**Pros:** UEs not allowed to use a Home Node B could be configured to not
access the Home NodeB PLMN, resulting in better battery performance for them,
and less signalling load towards the core Network (compared to only relying on
Cell Reselection parameters). Also, a separate PLMN ID allows to make UE
displaying the right network identifier, indicating to the user that he camps
on a Home NodeB cell, but requires some updates of the SIM/UICC and might not
work with older SIM cards.
**Cons:** Operators might not have additional PLMN IDs. Introduction of
additional PLMN ID might be costly as PLMN IDs have impact on existing
business infrastructure (billing, roaming agreements etc).
For older SIM cards the correct Operator PLMN ID display might not be
available.
Separate access control is needed in addition for all the cases.
#### 6.1.5.2 Manual Selection
Relying more on manual PLMN selection, the macro network does not need to
provide any cell reselection parameters to bring the UE to the Home NodeB.
**Pros:** No cell reselection parameter settings in the macro cells lead to
better UE battery performance for all UEs, also for UEs not allowed on a Home
NodeB, and less signalling load towards the core network created from those
UEs. Manual Selection is a robust mechanism.
**Cons:** Manual selection of the macro PLMN might be needed when moving out
of the Home NodeB. This might not be acceptable for the user.
#### 6.1.5.3 Equivalent PLMN
Equivalent PLMN feature was introduced as a means to enable cell reselection
between PLMNs. The equivalent PLMNs are considered equivalent to the
registered PLMN regarding PLMN selection, cell selection, cell re-selection
and handover.
The list of equivalent PLMNs of a UE can be updated at location registration.
UEs not allowed to use a Home NodeB would never have the Home NodeB PLMN as an
equivalent PLMN, thus such UEs would never try to access a Home NodeB cell.
Furthermore, UEs allowed to use Home NodeB could be configured with Home NodeB
PLMN ID (as an equivalent PLMN) only in registration areas overlapping the
geographical location of the Home NodeB cell.
**Pros:** Additional PLMN ID for Home NodeB cells can be introduced without
modifying UE SIM. UEs allowed to use Home NodeB could be configured to not
access the Home NodeB PLMN outside the macro registration area overlapping
their Home NodeB cell, resulting in better battery performance for them, and
less signalling load towards the core Network
**Cons** : This mechanism does not provide any help for UEs to find their Home
NodeB cell.
Additional effort for configuration and execution of selective signaling of
ePLMN list, depending on LA and UE.
#### 6.1.5.4 National Roaming
National roaming is a feature where when the mobile is not roaming in its
HPLMN, but on a VPLMN of the same country as the HPLMN. In automatic PLMN
selection mode it could be set in a mode where it searches periodically for it
HPLMN [126].
Proposed solution:
UEs allowed to use Home NodeB are national roaming when in macro cell layer.
The PLMN id of the Home NodeB is the HPLMN of the UE and is different from the
Macro cells PLMN identity. The Macro PLMN is thus a VPLMN. In this case the UE
performs a background PLMN search depending on the configuration of the SIM
timer field. By configuring the background PLMN search timer to the minimum of
every 6 min. So the average time to finding the Home NodeB when in coverage
would be around 3 min.
As a refinement to this scheme (and save UE power) the timer can be
reconfigured when moving outside its \"home\" macro LA for example using SIM
tool kit details are FFS and need to be studied.
**Pros** : UEs allowed to use Home NodeB could find Home NodeB cells
irrespective of Macro Layer Cell Reselection parameters. Thus, the impact to
UEs not allowed to use Home NodeB of introducing Home NodeB cells would be
minimal/zero, regarding battery consumption and signaling load towards the
core network. There would be no need to include Home NodeB cells in macro
layer neighbor cell lists. This mechanism is robust. There would be no need to
rely on manual selection.
**Cons** : Need to update SIM and IMSI for UEs allowed to use Home NodeB.
Might not work with older SIM cards. Changing/updating SIM and or IMSI is an
issue for operators.
## 6.2 Access control scenarios
This section includes the investigation how to manage access control for the
Home NodeB
### 6.2.1 Access Control by mobility management signalling
A common assumption is that Access Control is done by mobility management
signalling. Each Home NodeB is assigned a Home NodeB specific Location area.
UEs not allowed in a certain Home NodeB receives negative response at location
registration, having the effect that UEs not allowed in this Home NodeB are
not allowed to camp normally.
Reject causes, depending on use case, could be:
  * LA Not allowed
  * Roaming not allowed in LA.
A side-effect of using registration area update rejects, is that a UE would
not reattempt to reselect to this frequency for the next 300s (unless there is
no alternative), if the UE is Rel-5 UE and the procedure is implemented.
To reduce time in out-of-service or limited camped state there should always
be a frequency available with cells where LA is allowed, i.e. there should be
a non- Home NodeB frequency layer.
**Pro:** Access Control is immediate, simple solution.
**Con:** This method involves quite much mobility management signalling. Also,
if a UE slips outside the coverage of his Home NodeB cell, and tries to
register to a neighbour Home NodeB cell, he cannot re-register with his own
Home NodeB cell until after 300s timer expiry.
### 6.2.2 Access Control by redirection and handover
An alternative approach is to allow UEs that are allowed to use a Home NodeB
to roam and camp also on Home NodeB cells, where they are not allowed. Access
Control would then be done by redirecting or handing over non-allowed UEs to a
macro cell, when data transmission service is requested.
In this approach a number of Home NodeB would be configured in to one LA.
Mobiles would perform cell reselection between these cells without the need to
perform location update (for example all Home NodeB in a building are
configured as one LA) so as long as coverage is more or less constant no LA
update is needed when moving from one Home NodeB to another Home NodeB in the
same local vicinity.
An issue with this network configuration is that hand-over or redirection
might not always work, e.g. in case there is no macro cell in coverage. In
this situation, a non-allowed UE camping on a Home NodeB cell would
"erroneously" indicate to the user that it is in-service.
A possible way of handling this could be that Home NodeB that are out of
service of macro cell would be handled by access control by mobility
management signalling according to the previous chapter.
**Pros** : Reduced mobility management signaling, and corresponding battery
saving, especially in dense Home NodeB deployments.
**Cons:** Configuration of location area for a Home NodeB cell might need to
depend on coverage / deployment scenario, i.e. if deployment case 1 applies or
not. Another side effect could be increased session setup times, or increased
handover signaling
# 7 UTRAN Architecture and Application Protocol (RAN WG3)
## 7.1 Architectural support of 3G Home NodeB
The support of the 3G Home NodeB is ensured within the framework provided in
the UTRAN architecture as described in [127], with support of legacy UEs and
legacy core networks. Possible enhancements to the Iu interface architecture
to cater with scalability issues are described in section 7.3.
## 7.2 Deployment option(s)
The UTRAN architecture supports different deployment options, in particular an
Iub deployment and an Iu deployment option.
The preferred deployment option is with Iu or Iu-based termination at the 3G
Home NB.
Different deployment options based on Iu has also been discussed, all relying
on an access concentrator or gateway between 3G Home NB and core network:
 GAN --based Home NB Gateway without impact on Iu specifications ([129]),
 Femto Gateway without impact on Iu specifications ([130]),
 Iu --based Home NB Gateway ([131]),
## 7.3 Impact to the UTRAN interfaces
### 7.3.1 Iu Interface Architecture
The overall UMTS architecture and UTRAN architectures are described in [137].
This subclause specifies only the architecture of the Iu interface when
applied for 3G HNB access.
Whereas the I~u~ interface is specified at the boundary between the Core
Network and UTRAN, the I~uh-~ interface is specified between the 3G HNB GW and
the 3G HNB. Figure 7.3.1-1 depicts the logical division of the I~u~ interface
and the I~uh~ interface. From the I~u~ interface perspective, the UTRAN access
point is an 3G HNB GW.
Figure 7.3.1-1. I~u~ and I~uh~ Interface Architecture.
The 3G HNB and 3G HNB GW in combination supports all of the UTRAN functions,
as described in section 4 of [135]. The legacy UTRAN functions in the 3G HNB
are supported by RANAP, whereas the functions 3G HNB Registstration, UE
Registration and 3G HNB GW discovery (FFS) are supported by the new protocol
Home NodeB Application Protocol (HNBAP) between the 3G HNB and the 3G HNB GW.
These functions are described in section 7.3.4.2. The 3G HNB GW provides
concentration function for the control plane and may provide concentration
function for the user plane.
There can be several 3G HNB GWs within UTRAN, and each 3G HNB GW may have
several 3G HNBs, and so UTRAN may have several I~u~ access points towards the
Core Network. As a minimum, each Iu access point (in UTRAN or CN) shall
independently fulfil the requirements of the relevant Iu specifications
(25.41x series).
#### 7.3.1.2 Implementation of the NAS Node Selection Function
The optional NAS Node Selection Function (NNSF) is described in [136].
If the NAS Node Selection Function is deployed with in the UTRAN, it resides
within the RNC or 3G HNB GW.
### 7.3.2 I~uh~ Interface Characteristics
Alternative means to provide connection oriented services for RANAP and
connectionless services for RANAP and HNBAP are under discussion
Three alternatives are under consideration for the mapping of RANAP to
underlying protocols. The target is to reduce the number of alternatives.
#### 7.3.2.1 Use of SCCP (Alternative 1)
Section 4.5 of [135] shall apply for UTRAN for 3G HNB access as well.
The only difference is that the 3G HNB GW will terminate the SCCP stack
towards the 3G HNB and towards the CN and therefore in total two SCCP
signalling bearers exist between the CN and the 3G HNB.
#### 7.3.2.2 Use of SCTP with UE context indicated through PPI (Alternative 2)
For the deplyoment of 3G HNBs SCTP as specified in [134] is defined as an
alternative transport network user plane layer for the signalling bearer. For
connection-oriented procedures as defined to be supported by RANAP, the PPI
field of the SCTP payload header is used to denote a dedicated Iu signalling
connection. The 3G HNB and the 3G HNB GW respectively, are responsible for the
allocation of unique Iu signalling connection identifications within the PPI
field.
Note: For connectionless procedures as defined to be supported by RANAP and
the HNB Application Protocol, no specific method as for connection oriented
procedures are necessary on SCTP level.
Typically, two single SCTP streams are allocated, one for conveing Iu-cs
protocol services, the other for conveing Iu-ps protocol services.
#### 7.3.2.3 Use of SCTP with Lightweight Adaptation Layer (Alternative 3)
For the deployment of 3G HNBs, SCTP as specified in [134] is defined as the
transport network user plane layer for the signalling bearer. For connection-
oriented procedures as defined to be supported by RANAP, an adaptation layer
i.e. RANAP User Adaptation (RUA) is introduced to denote a dedicated Iu
signalling connection. The RUA contains information necessary for UE
connection management at the 3G HNB and 3G HNB GW as well as the necessary
information to support NNSF functionality.
Note: For connectionless procedures as defined to be supported by RANAP a
single pair of stream identifiers shall be reserved.
Domain indicator (i.e. CS/PS) is also provided by the RUA layer.
### 7.3.3 Use of Transport Network User Plane as User Data Bearer
On the Iuh interface only TNL stack options for the IP transport option are
used.
### 7.3.4 Functions of the I~uh~ Interface Protocols & Functional Split
#### 7.3.4.1 Support of Legacy UTRAN functions
Legacy UTRAN functions are supported through the RANAP control plane on Iuh.
The division of functions between 3G HNB and 3G HNB GW are FFS.
#### 7.3.4.2 Agreed new functions for support of 3G HNB deployment
New functions have been identified as necessary to allow the 3G HNB deployment
in UTRAN. The following lists the agreed functions.
##### 7.3.4.2.1 3G HNB Registration Function
**The 3G HNB Registration Function provides means to register the 3G HNB at
the 3G HNB GW on RNL level and resides in the 3G HNB and the 3G HNB GW.**
##### 7.3.4.2.2 UE Registration Function for 3G HNB
**The UE Registration Function for 3G HNB provides means for the 3G HNB to
convey UE identification data to the 3G HNB GW in order to perform access
control for the UE in the 3G HNB GW. The UE Registration also informs the 3G
HNB GW of the specific 3G HNB where the UE is located.**
#### 7.3.4.3 New functions under discussion for support of 3G HNB deployment
The following lists the new functions under discussions for 3G HNB deployment
in UTRAN.
##### 7.3.4.3.1 3G HNB GW Discovery Function (FFS)
**The 3G HNB Discovery Function provides the means for a designated
"Provisioning HNB GW" to provide the address for the Serving 3G HNB GW for the
3G HNB. The 3G HNB will use the Serving 3G HNB GW address to Register with the
Serving 3G HNB GW.**

Figure 4. Interference scenarios
The diverse input to this study item on Home Node B / eNode B has revealed
that a wide range of possible deployment configurations are envisioned for the
HNB. This study uses interference scenarios to investigate the impact on Home
Node B deployment on the existing basestation requirements. However, the
interference scenarios are dependent on the deployment configurations.
Specifically, the most important deployment characteristics are as follows
  * Open access or CSG (Closed Subscriber Group)
    * Open access HNBs can serve any UE in the same way as a normal NodeB
    * CSG HNBs only serve UEs which are a member of a particular Closed Subscriber Group
  * Dedicated carrier or co-channel
    * Whether HNBs operate in their own separate channel, or whether they share a carrier with an existing (e)UTRAN network
Furthermore, how an operator chooses to manage Home Node B power has a strong
impact on the interference analysis. Therefore, this study distinguished
between the following methods of managing the HNB transmit power
  * Fixed: HNBs have a set fixed maximum transmit power.
  * Adaptive: HNBs sense interference to existing networks, and adjust maximum transmit power accordingly
Home Node B's enhance the coverage of a UMTS Radio Access Network in the home
environment. However, it is not feasible to completely control the deployment
of the HNB layer within the UMTS RAN. Therefore, interference due to the HNB
is a concern and this report concludes that interference mitigation techniques
are required in the case of closed access. No single method has been
identified that completely eliminates interference while maintaining HNB
performance for closed access. It is not the intention of this report to
recommend a set of specification or an algorithm that ensures feasibility of
the Home Node B. Rather, this report evaluates the effectiveness of
interference control with an acceptable trade-off between macro layer and HNB
performance over a set of deployment configurations.
The analysis of the various configurations resulted in the following
observations:
  * Open access configuration will result in lower interference levels than Closed Subscriber Group Operation.
  * Dedicated carrier deployment results in much lower interference levels than co-channel deployment.
  * A CSG HNB deployment (whether dedicated or co-channel) requires interference mitigation techniques in order to control the inter-HNB interference for both the downlink and uplink. 
  * It is not possible to control the downlink co-channel interference through fixed maximum HNB transmit power setting in case of co-channel CSG HNB deployment.
  * A \"partial co-channel\" approach for UTRAN operating on two channels can provide higher spectral efficiency than obtained with a dedicated carrier approach while maintaining the same cell edge performance.
  * In case of CSG co-channel HNB deployment it is possible to control the uplink and downlink interference levels to the macro layer through appropriate use of interference mitigation techniques and thus maintain a suitable performance trade-off between the HNB and Macro layers.
For a successful Home Node B deployment, minimum performance requirements are
needed for all scenarios in Table 11, for both dedicated and co-channel
deployments.
# 9 Conclusions
## 9.1 RAN4 Conclusions
> In its study of the feasibility of the Home (e)NodeB RAN4 has identified new
> requirements affecting RF aspects. The feasibility of meeting these is
> addressed in the following numbered items,
  1. Home (e)NodeBs should not degrade significantly the performance of networks deployed in other channels. Feasible. Dedicated carrier deployment of Home Node B's is feasible for both open and closed subscriber group systems in a wide range of deployment configurations. Co-existence between HNB and UTRAN networks in adjacent channels is comparable with co-existence for local area bases stations.
  2. Home (e)NodeB configurations intended for deployment in the same channel as an existing (e)UTRAN network should ensure their combined performance is not significantly worse than that of the original network. Feasible, however, especially in the case of CSG there will be an increased level of interference relative to dedicated deployment; interference mitigation techniques have been studied to reduce this.
  3. Home (e)NodeBs should provide reasonable performance whether deployed in isolation or whether multiple Home (e)NodeBs are deployed in the same area. Feasible. However, in high density deployments, techniques may be needed to mitigate inter-HNB interference.
  4. As a Home (e)NodeBs may be privately owned and portable, it shall only radiate while it is confirmed that such an emission complies with regulatory requirements in force where that Home NodeB is operating. Feasible. (SA1, SA2, SA3 response)
  5. The Home NodeB must support UE speeds up to [30] km/h. Feasible
  6. Home NodeB must support existing UTRAN UEs. Feasible (RAN2 response)
## 9.2 RAN2 summary, conclusions and recommendations
RAN2 has studied intra-frequency and inter-frequency mobility solutions and
access control for UMTS Home-NodeBs. Different solutions taken the requirement
to be based on current Rel-7 status have been studied. No quantitative results
have been presented.
The conclusion from a RAN2 point of view is that there is not one good
solution. There are a few solutions but they all have their
drawbacks/limitations. It can be made to work but with some restrictions on
deployment. The operator would have to decide whether he is happy with the
restrictions.
For release 8 UEs, some mechanisms that optimise mobility and access control
have already been presented.

**[Recommendation for Rel-8 UMTS Home NodeB]{.underline}**
> 1) Solutions to optimise the mobility and access control should be
> specified;
>
> 2) Solution for UMTS Home-NodeB aligned with the ones decided for E-UTRAN
> Home-eNBs ("CSG cells") should be analysed first;
>
> 3) The removal of constraints in the procedures for the (macro) cell
> reselection in order to efficiently support Home-NodeB cells should also be
> investigated (e.g. removal of cell barring for 300 s for reselection if
> highest ranked cell is a CSG cell).
## 9.3 RAN3 Conclusions
RAN3 concludes that the support of deployment of 3G Home NBs, with legacy UEs
and legacy core network nodes, is feasible. Further enhancements for improved
support of 3G Home NBs were proposed and can be further considered.
