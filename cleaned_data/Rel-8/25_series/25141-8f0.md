# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Ancillary RF amplifier:** a piece of equipment, which when connected by RF
coaxial cables to the BS, has the primary function to provide amplification
between the transmit and/or receive antenna connector of a BS and an antenna
without requiring any control signal to fulfil its amplifying function.
**Bit Error Ratio:** The Bit Error Ratio is defined as the ratio of the bits
wrongly received to all data bits sent. The bits are the data bits above the
convolutional/turbo decoder. The BER is the overall BER independent of frame
erasures or when erased frames are not defined.
**Block Error Ratio:** A Block Error Ratio is defined as the ratio of the
number of erroneous blocks received to the total number of blocks sent. An
erroneous block is a Transport Block whose cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is
wrong.
**Mean power:** When applied to a W-CDMA modulated signal this is the power
(transmitted or received) in a bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip
rate of the radio access mode. The period of measurement shall be at least one
timeslot unless otherwise stated.
**RRC filtered mean power:** The mean power as measured through a root raised
cosine filter with roll-off factor α and a bandwidth equal to the chip rate of
the radio access mode.
NOTE 1: The RRC filtered mean power of a perfectly modulated W-CDMA signal is
0,246 dB lower than the mean power of the same signal.
NOTE 2: The roll-off factor α factor is defined in [1] section 6.8.1.
**Code domain power:** That part of the mean power which correlates with a
particular (OVSF) code channel. The sum of all powers in the code domain
equals the mean power in a bandwidth of (1+ α) times the chip rate of the
radio access mode. See Annex E.2.5.1.
**Output power:** The mean power of one carrier of the base station, delivered
to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the
transmitter.
**Rated output power:** Rated output power of the base station is the mean
power level per carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at
the antenna connector.
**Maximum output power:** The mean power level per carrier of the base station
measured at the antenna connector in a specified reference condition.
**Power control dynamic range:** The difference between the maximum and the
minimum code domain power of a code channel for a specified reference
condition.
**Total power dynamic range:** The difference between the maximum and the
minimum total power for a specified reference condition.

## 3.4 Radio Frequency bands
### 3.4.1 Frequency bands
a) UTRA/FDD is designed to operate in the following paired bands:
Table 3.0: Frequency bands
+----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | Operating Band | UL Frequencies | DL frequencies | | | | | | | UE transmit, Node B receive | UE receive, Node B transmit | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | I | 1 920 - 1 980 MHz | 2 110 - 2 170 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | II | 1 850 - 1 910 MHz | 1 930 - 1 990 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | III | 1 710 - 1 785 MHz | 1 805 - 1 880 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | IV | 1 710 - 1 755 MHz | 2 110 - 2 155 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | V | 824 - 849MHz | 869 - 894MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | VI | 830 - 840 MHz | 875 - 885 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | VII | 2 500 - 2 570 MHz | 2 620 - 2 690 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | VIII | 880 - 915 MHz | 925 - 960 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | IX | 1 749,9 - 1 784,9 MHz | 1 844,9 - 1 879,9 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | X | 1 710 - 1 770 MHz | 2 110 - 2 170 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | XI | 1427.9 - 1447.9 MHz | 1475.9 - 1495.9 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | XII | 699 - 716 MHz | 729 - 746 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | XIII | 777 - 787 MHz | 746 - 756 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+ | XIV | 788 - 798 MHz | 758 - 768 MHz | +----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
b) Deployment in other frequency bands is not precluded
### 3.4.2 TX-RX frequency separation
a) UTRA/FDD is designed to operate with the following TX-RX frequency
separation
Table 3.0A: TX-RX frequency separation
* * *
Operating Band TX-RX frequency separation I 190 MHz II 80 MHz. III 95 MHz. IV
400 MHz V 45 MHz VI 45 MHz VII 120 MHz VIII 45 MHz IX 95 MHz X 400 MHz XI 48
MHz XII 30 MHz XIII 31 MHz XIV 30 MHz
* * *
b) UTRA/FDD can support both fixed and variable transmit to receive frequency
separation.
c) The use of other transmit to receive frequency separations in existing or
other frequency bands shall not be precluded.
## 3.5 Channel arrangement
### 3.5.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 3.5.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a number of
additional centre frequencies are specified according to table 3.2, which
means that the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
### 3.5.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN). For each operating Band, the UARFCN values are
defined as follows.
Uplink: N~U~ = 5 * (F~UL~ - F~UL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~UL_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤ F~UL_high~
Downlink: N~D~ = 5 * (F~DL~ - F~DL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~DL_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤ F~DL_high~
For each operating Band, F~UL_Offset~, F~UL_low~, F~UL_high~, F~DL_Offset~,,
F~DL_low~ and F~DL_high~ are defined in Table 3.1 for the general UARFCN. For
the additional UARFCN, F~UL_Offset~, F~DL_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and
F~DL~ are defined in Table 3.2.

# 4 General test conditions and declarations
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.
Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter relative to a
value that is not fully specified in the UTRA specifications. For these tests,
the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal value specified by
the manufacturer.
Certain functions of a BS are optional in the UTRA specifications. Some
requirements for the BS may be regional as listed in subclause 4.7.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported.
## 4.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the stimulus
signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance and
the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the
specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and
are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 4.1 apply
to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include
system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.
### 4.1.1 Measurement of test environments
The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments defined in Subclause 4.4,
Test environments shall be.
> Pressure: ±5 kPa.
>
> Temperature: ±2 degrees.
>
> Relative Humidity: ±5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ±1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ±1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

## 4.2 Test Tolerances (informative)
The Test Tolerances defined in this subclause have been used to relax the
Minimum Requirements in this specification to derive the Test Requirements.
The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test
Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.
The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.)

### 4.2.4 RRM measurements
The following tolerances refer to the requirements of 25.133.
tbd
## 4.3 Interpretation of measurement results
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5.
The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the measurement of
each parameter shall be included in the test report.
The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in subclause 4.1 of
this specification.
If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in subclause 4.1, it is still permitted to use
this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
subclause 4.1 shall be used to tighten the Test Requirement-making the test
harder to pass. (For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this may require
modification of stimulus signals). This procedure (defined in Annex F) will
ensure that a Test System not compliant with subclause 4.1does not increase
the chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with subclause 4.1 had been
used.
## 4.3A Base station classes
The requirements in the present document apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations, Local Area Base Stations and Home Base Stations
unless otherwise stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 99, 4 and 5.
Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 45 dB**.
Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Femto
Cell** scenarios.
The manufacturer shall declare the intended class of the BS under test.
## 4.4 Test environments
For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions under
which the BS is to be tested are defined.
### 4.4.1 Normal test environment
When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should be
performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions stated in
table 4.2.
Table 4.2: Limits of conditions for Normal Test Environment
* * *
Condition Minimum Maximum Barometric pressure 86 kPa 106 kPa Temperature 15°C
30°C Relative Humidity 20 % 85 % Power supply Nominal, as declared by the
manufacturer  
Vibration Negligible
* * *
The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent the
maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within the
specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test report.
NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.
### 4.4.2 Extreme test environment
The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:
1) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the IEC 60
721-3-3 [6];
2) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the IEC 60
721-3-4 [7];
3) the equipment that dose not comply to the mentioned classes, the relevant
classes from IEC 60 721 documentation for Temperature, Humidity and Vibration
shall be declared.
NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall out side of the standard
operational conditions are not tested in the present document. These may be
stated and tested separately.
#### 4.4.2.1 Extreme temperature
When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum operating temperatures
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
**Minimum temperature:**
The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 [8].
**Maximum temperature:**
The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 [9].
NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational prior to
the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.
### 4.4.3 Vibration
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under test. This shall use
the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing the required
environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to the test procedure
of IEC 60 068-2-6 [10]. Other environmental conditions shall be within the
ranges specified in subclause 4.4.1.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to
equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should only
vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.
### 4.4.4 Power supply
When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test shall
be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating voltage
defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
**Upper voltage limit:**
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to
the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 [8] Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60 068-2-2 [9]
Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.
**Lower voltage limit:**
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to
the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 [8] Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60 068-2-2 [9]
Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.
### 4.4.5 Definition of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) Interferer
The minimum bandwidth of the AWGN interferer shall be 1.5 times chip rate of
the radio access mode. (e.g. 5.76 MHz for a chip rate of 3.84 Mcps). The
flatness across this minimum bandwidth shall be less than ±0.5 dB and the peak
to average ratio at a probability of 0.001% shall exceed 10 dB.
## 4.5 Selection of configurations for testing
Most tests in the present document are only performed for a subset of the
possible combinations of test conditions. For instance:
‑ not all transceivers in the configuration may be specified to be tested;
‑ only one RF channel may be specified to be tested;
‑ only one timeslot may be specified to be tested.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.
When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the choice of which combinations
are to be tested may be specified by an operator.
## 4.6 BS Configurations
### 4.6.1 Receiver diversity
For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement applies at
each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna diversity .
Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the remaining
receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the
manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be equivalent, it is
sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any one of the receiver
antenna connectors.
### 4.6.2 Duplexers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer fitted,
if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS. If the duplexer is supplied as an
option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests should be repeated with and
without the duplexer fitted to verify that the BS meets the requirements of
the present document in both cases.
The following tests should be performed with the duplexer fitted, and without
it fitted if this is an option:
1) subclause 6.2.1, base station maximum output power, for the highest static
power step only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;
2) subclause 6.5, output RF spectrum emissions; outside the BS transmit band;
3) subclause 6.5.3.4.3, protection of the BS receiver;
4) subclause 6.6, transmit intermedulation; for the testing of conformance,
the carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize intermodulation
products from the transmitters falling in receive channels.
The remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer fitted.
NOTE 1: When performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is important
to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not affect the test
apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of attenuators, isolators
and filters.
NOTE 2: When duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be generated,
not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The intermodulation
products generated in the antenna system are not controlled by 3GPP
specifications, and may degrade during operation (e.g. due to moisture
ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued satisfactory operation of a BS, an
operator will normally select ARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products
falling on receive channels. For testing of complete conformance, an operator
may specify the ARFCNs to be used.
### 4.6.3 Power supply options
If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply configurations,
it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the power supply
options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of conditions
over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the range of
conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be supplied
either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In this case, the
conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power supply options can be
tested by testing only the external DC supply option. The range of DC input
voltages for the test should be sufficient to verify the performance with any
of the power supplies, over its range of operating conditions within the BS,
including variation of mains input voltage, temperature and output current.
### 4.6.4 Ancillary RF amplifiers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with the ancillary RF
amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7 for TX and RX
respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting
network ( including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to
make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary amplifier and
the BS. The applicable connecting network loss range is declared by the
manufacturer. Other characteristics and the temperature dependence of the
attenuation of the connecting network are neglected. The actual attenuation
value of the connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the
applicable extreme values. The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.
Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted and,
if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.
When testing, the following tests should be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where x denotes that
the test is applicable:
Table 4.3
* * *
Receiver Tests Subclause TX amplifier only RX amplifier only TX/RX amplifiers
combined (Note) 7.2 X X 7.5 X X 7.6 x X 7.7 x  
Transmitter Tests 6.2 x X 6.5.1 X X 6.5.2.2 X x 6.5.3 x X 6.6 x X
* * *
NOTE: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The amplifiers
can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of these amplifiers
could be a passive network.
In test according to subclauses 6.2 and 7.2 highest applicable attenuation
value is applied.
### 4.6.5 BS using antenna arrays
A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some or all
of its transceivers or with an antenna array related to one cell (not one
array per transceiver). This subclause applies to a BS which meets at least
one of the following conditions:
\- the transmitter output signals from one or more transceiver appear at more
than one antenna port; or
\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a transceiver or per cell
and an input signal is required at more than one port for the correct
operation of the receiver thus the outputs from the transmitters as well as
the inputs to the receivers are directly connected to several antennas (known
as \"aircombining\"); or
\- transmitters and receivers are connected via duplexers to more than one
antenna.
In case of diversity or MIMO, multiple antennas are not considered as an
antenna array.If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with an
antenna system which contains filters or active elements which are necessary
to meet the UTRA requirements, the conformance tests may be performed on a
system comprising the BS together with these elements, supplied separately for
the purposes of testing. In this case, it must be demonstrated that the
performance of the configuration under test is representative of the system in
normal operation, and the conformance assessment is only applicable when the
BS is used with the antenna system.
For conformance testing of such a BS, the following procedure may be used.
#### 4.6.5.1 Receiver tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna connectors
shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals the
power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1: Receiver test set-up
For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may be
performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.
#### 4.6.5.2 Transmitter tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the transmitter antenna connectors
**(P~i~)** shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied
equals the power of the test signal(s) **(P~s~)** specified in the test. This
may be assessed by separately measuring the signals emitted by each antenna
connector and summing the results, or by combining the signals and performing
a single measurement. The characteristics (e.g. amplitude and phase) of the
combining network should be such that the power of the combined signal is
maximised.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.2.
Figure 4.2: Transmitter test set-up
For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately for each
transmitter antenna connector.
### 4.6.6 Transmit diversity and MIMO transmission
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present document,
the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector in case of
transmit diversity or MIMO transmission.
Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to measure
the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors.
### 4.6.7 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the integrated
Iuant BS modem shall be switched off. Spurious emissions according to clauses
6.5.3 and 7.7 shall be measured only for frequencies above 20MHz with the
integrated Iuant BS modem switched on.
## 4.7 Regional requirements
Some requirements in TS 25.141 may only apply in certain regions. Table 4.4
lists all requirements that may be applied differently in different regions.

* * *
Note *: Base station classes,: This regional requirement should be reviewed to
check its necessity every TSG RAN meeting.
## 4.8 Specified frequency range
The manufacturer shall declare:
\- which of the frequency bands defined in sub-clause 3.4 is supported by the
BS.
\- the frequency range within the above frequency band(s) supported by the BS.
Many tests in this TS are performed with appropriate frequencies in the
bottom, middle and top of the operating frequency band of the BS. These are
denoted as RF channels B (bottom), M (middle) and T (top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single carrier at
each of the RF channels B, M and T.
When the requirements are specific to multiple carriers, and the BS is
declared to support N>1 carriers, numbered from 1 to N, the interpretation of
B, M and T for test purposes shall be as follows:
For testing at B,
\- the carrier of lowest frequency shall be centred on B
For testing at M,
\- if the number N of carriers supported is odd, the carrier (N+1)/2 shall be
centred on M,
\- if the number N of carriers supported is even, the carrier N/2 shall be
centred on M.
For testing at T
\- the carrier of highest frequency shall be centred on T
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the UARFCNs to be used for RF
channels B, M and T shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may
consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.
When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the UARFCNs to be used for RF
channels B, M and T may be specified by an operator.
# 5 Format and interpretation of tests
Each test in the following clauses has a standard format:
**X Title**
All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the present
document, unless otherwise stated.
**X.1 Definition and applicability**
> This subclause gives the general definition of the parameter under
> consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all equipment
> or only to a certain subset.

test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-
up.
> **X.4.2 Procedure**
>
> This subclause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
> provides further details of the test definition like point of access (e.g.
> antenna port), domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g.
> bandwidth), and algorithms (e.g. averaging).

See subclause 4.3 Interpretation of measurement results.
# 6 Transmitter
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of transmit diversity or MIMO
transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter antenna connector.
A BS supporting DC-HSDPA transmits two cells simultaneously on adjacent
carrier frequencies.
Unless otherwise stated, all tests in this clause shall be performed at the BS
antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus such
as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used, the
tests according to subclauses 4.6.2 and/or 4.6.4, depending on the device
added, shall be performed to ensure that the requirements are met at test port
B.
Figure 6.1: Transmitter test ports
Power levels are expressed in dBm.
### 6.1.1 Test Models
The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according to
one of the test models below. A reference to the applicable table is made with
each test.
For Tx diversity transmission, the same test model shall be used for both
antennas. No diversity coding of the test models is required.
A code \"level setting\" of -X dB is the setting that according to the base
station manufacturer will result in a code domain power of nominally X dB
below the maximum output power. The relative accuracy of the code domain power
to the maximum output power shall have tolerance of ±1 dB.
#### 6.1.1.1 Test Model 1
This model shall be used for tests on:
\- occupied bandwidth;
\- spectrum emission mask;
\- ACLR;
\- spurious emissions;
\- transmit intermodulation;
\- base station maximum output power.
> \- Total power dynamic range (at Pmax)
>
> \- Home base station output power for adjacent channel protection
>
> \- Frequency error (at Pmax)
>
> \- IPDL time mask
Due to the amplitude statistics of TM1 [2], it is sufficient to test all
requirements above with TM1 regardless of the modulation schemes supported by
the Node-B.
In addition, the test model is used for Error Vector Magnitude using QPSK
modulation (at Pmax).
64 DPCHs at 30 ksps (SF=128) are distributed randomly across the code space,
at random power levels and random timing offsets are defined so as to simulate
a realistic traffic scenario which may have high PAR (Peak to Average Ratio).
Considering that not every base station implementation will support 64 DPCH,
variants of this test model containing 32 and 16 DPCH are also specified. For
Home base station, additional options of this test model containing 8 and 4
DPCH are also specified. The conformance test shall be performed using the
largest of these options that can be supported by the equipment under test.
\"Fraction of power\" is relative to the maximum output power on the TX
antenna interface under test.

#### 6.1.1.4A Test Model 5
This model shall be used for tests on:
\- EVM for base stations supporting HS-PDSCH transmission using 16QAM
modulation (at Pmax)
Considering that not every base station implementation will support 8 HS-PDSCH
+ 30 DPCH, variants of this test model containing 4 HS-PDSCH + 14 DPCH and 2
HS-PDSCH + 6 DPCH are also specified. For Home base station, an additional
option of this test model containing 4 HS-PDSCH + 4 DPCH is also specified.
The conformance test shall be performed using the largest of these options
that can be supported by the equipment under test, where the largest is
firstly determined by the number of HS-PDSCH and then by the number of DPCH.
Each HS-PDSCH is modulated by 16QAM.

#### 6.1.1.5 DPCH Structure of the Downlink Test Models
For the above test models the following structure is adopted for the DPCH. The
DPDCH and DPCCH have the same power level. The timeslot structure should be as
described by TS 25.211-slot format 10 and 6 that are reproduced in table 6.7.
Table 6.7: DPCH structure of the downlink test models
* * *
Slot Format Channel Bit Channel Symbol SF Bits/Frame Bits/ Slot DPDCH

* * *
The test DPCH has frame structure so that the pilot bits are defined over 15
timeslots according to the relevant columns of TS 25.211, which are reproduced
in table 6.8.
Table 6.8: Frame structure of DPCH
+-----------+------------+----+----+----+ | | Npilot = 8 | | | | +-----------+------------+----+----+----+ | Symbol # | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | +-----------+------------+----+----+----+ | Slot #0 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 10 | | | | | | | | 1 | 11 | 00 | 11 | 10 | | | | | | | | 2 | 11 | 01 | 11 | 01 | | | | | | | | 3 | 11 | 00 | 11 | 00 | | | | | | | | 4 | 11 | 10 | 11 | 01 | | | | | | | | 5 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 10 | | | | | | | | 6 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 00 | | | | | | | | 7 | 11 | 10 | 11 | 00 | | | | | | | | 8 | 11 | 01 | 11 | 10 | | | | | | | | 9 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | | | | | | | | 10 | 11 | 01 | 11 | 01 | | | | | | | | 11 | 11 | 10 | 11 | 11 | | | | | | | | 12 | 11 | 10 | 11 | 00 | | | | | | | | 13 | 11 | 00 | 11 | 11 | | | | | | | | 14 | 11 | 00 | 11 | 11 | +-----------+------------+----+----+----+
The TPC bits alternate 00 / 11 starting with 00 in timeslot 0.
The aggregate 15 x 30 = 450 DPDCH bits per frame are filled with a PN9
sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . In case there are less data
bits/frame needed then the first bits of the aggregate shall be selected. To
ensure non-correlation of the PN9 sequences, each DPDCH shall use its
channelization code as the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each
frame, according to its timing offset.
The sequence shall be generated in a nine-stage shift register whose 5^th^ and
9^th^ stage outputs are added in a modulo‑two addition stage, and the result
is fed back to the input of the first stage. The generator shall be seeded so
that the sequence begins with the channelization code starting from the LSB,
and followed by 2 consecutive ONEs for SF=128 and 1 consecutive ONE for
SF=256.
Figure 6.2
#### 6.1.1.6 Common channel Structure of the Downlink Test Models
##### 6.1.1.6.1 P-CCPCH
The aggregate 15 x 18 = 270 P-CCPCH bits per frame are filled with a PN9
sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . Channelization code of the
P-CCPCH is used as the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each frame.
The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the 8 bit
channelization code starting from the LSB, and followed by a ONE.
##### 6.1.1.6.2 PICH
PICH carries 18 Paging Indicators (Pq) sent in the following sequence from
left to right [1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0]. This defines the 288
first bits of the PICH. No power is transmitted for the 12 remaining unused
bits.
##### 6.1.1.6.3 Primary scrambling code and SCH
The scrambling code should be 0.
Where multiple repetitions of the Test Model signals are being used to
simulate a multi-carrier signal the scrambling code for the lower frequency is
0. Carriers added at successively higher frequencies use codes 1, 2,... and
their frame structures are time offset by 1/5, 2/5... of a time slot duration.
The scrambling code defines the SSC sequence of the secondary SCH. In their
active part, primary and secondary SCH share equally the power level defined
for \"PCCPCH+SCH\".
##### 6.1.1.6.4 S-CCPCH containing PCH
The aggregate 15 x 20 = 300 S-CCPCH bits per frame are used. Data bits are
filled with a PN9 sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . In case
there are less data bits/frame needed then the first bits of the aggregate
shall be selected.. Channelization code of the S-CCPCH is used as the seed for
the PN sequence at the start of each frame. For test purposes, any one of the
four possible slot formats 0,1, 2 and 3 can be supported. The support for all
four slot formats is not needed..
The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the 8 bit
channelization code starting from the LSB, and followed by a ONE. The test on
S-CCPCH has a frame structure so that the pilot bits are defined over 15
timeslots to the relevant columns of TS 25.211. The TFCI bits are filled with
ONEs whenever needed.
#### 6.1.1.7 HS-PDSCH Structure of the Downlink Test Model 5
There are 640 bits per slot in a 16QAM-modulated HS-PDSCH. The aggregate 15 x
640 = 9600 bits per frame are filled with repetitions of a PN9 sequence
generated using the primitive trinomial . To ensure non-correlation of the PN9
sequences, each HS-PDSCH shall use its channelization code multiplied by 23 as
the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each frame.
The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the
channelization code multiplied by 23 starting from the LSB.
Figure 6.2
#### 6.1.1.8 HS-SCCH Structure of the Downlink Test Models 5 and 6
There are 40 bits per time slot in a HS-SCCH. The aggregate 15 x 40 = 600 bits
per frame are filled with repetitions of a PN9 sequence generated using the
primitive trinomial . Channelization code of the HS-SCCH is used as the seed
for the PN sequence at the start of each frame. The generator shall be seeded
so that the sequence begins with the channelization code starting from the
LSB, and followed by 2 consecutive ONEs.
#### 6.1.1.9 HS-PDSCH Structure of the Downlink Test Model 6
There are 960 bits per slot in a 64QAM-modulated HS-PDSCH. The aggregate 15 x
960 = 14400 bits per frame are filled with repetitions of a PN9 sequence
generated using the primitive trinomial . To ensure non-correlation of the PN9
sequences, each HS-PDSCH shall use its channelization code multiplied by 23 as
the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each frame.
The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the
channelization code multiplied by 23 starting from the LSB.

## 6.2 Base station output power
Output power, Pout, of the base station is the mean power of one carrier
delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the
transmitter.
Rated output power, PRAT, of the base station is the mean power level per
carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the antenna
connector.
### 6.2.1 Base station maximum output power
#### 6.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
Maximum output power, Pmax, of the base station is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in specified reference condition.
In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply
also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal test
environment in subclause 4.4.1.
The rated output power, PRAT, of the BS shall be as specified in Table 6.8AA.

### 6.4.6 Home base station output power for adjacent channel protection
#### 6.4.6.1 Definition and applicability
The Home BS shall be capable of adjusting the transmitter output power to
minimize the interference level on the adjacent channels licensed to other
operators in the same geographical area while optimize the Home BS coverage.
These requirements are only applicable to Home BS. The requirements in this
clause are applicable for AWGN radio propagation conditions.
The output power, Pout, of the Home BS shall be as specified in Table 6.13A
under the following input conditions:
  * CPICH Êc, measured in dBm, is the code power of the Primary CPICH on one of the adjacent channels presented at the Home BS antenna connector for the CPICH received on the adjacent channels. If Tx diversity is applied on the Primary CPICH, CPICH Êc shall be the sum in [W] of the code powers of the Primary CPICH transmitted from each antenna.
  * Ioh, measured in dBm, is the total received power density, including signals and interference but excluding the own Home BS signal, presented at the Home BS antenna connector on the Home BS operating channel.
In case that both adjacent channels are licensed to other operators, the most
stringent requirement shall apply for Pout. In case the Home BS's operating
channel and both adjacent channels are licensed to the same operator, the
requirements of this clause do not apply.
The input conditions defined for the requirements in this section are
specified at the antenna connector of the Home BS. For Home BS receivers with
diversity, the requirements apply to each antenna connector separately, with
the other one(s) terminated or disabled .The requirements are otherwise
unchanged. For Home BS(s) without measurement capability, a reference antenna
with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for converting these power levels into field
strength requirements.

## 6.5 Output RF spectrum emissions
The physical channels for the following test(s) shall be set-up according to
subclause 6.1.1.1.
### 6.5.1 Occupied bandwidth
#### 6.5.1.1 Definition and applicability
The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below the
lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are each
equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean transmitted power.
The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0,5%.
#### 6.5.1.2 Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 [1] subclause 6.6.1.1.
#### 6.5.1.3 Test purpose
The occupied bandwidth, defined in the Radio Regulations of the International
Telecommunication Union ITU, is a useful concept for specifying the spectral
properties of a given emission in the simplest possible manner; see also ITU-R
Recommendation SM.328 [11]. The test purpose is to verify that the emission of
the BS does not occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided
and is, therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of the
spectrum beyond undue limits.
#### 6.5.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.5.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause 4.4.1.
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 4.8
1) Connect the Measurement device to the BS antenna connector.
2) Start transmission on a single carrier according to test model 1 defined in
subclause 6.1.1.1 at the manufacturer's specified maximum output power.
##### 6.5.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Measure the spectrum of the transmitted signal across a span of 10 MHz,
based on an occupied bandwidth requirement of 5 MHz. The selected resolution
bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser shall be 30 kHz or less. The spectrum
shall be measured at 400 or more points across the measurement span.
NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode must be power
responding. There are at least two ways to be power responding. The spectrum
analyser can be set to \"sample\" detection, with its video bandwidth setting
at least three times its RBW setting. Or the analyser may be set to respond to
the average of the power (root-mean-square of the voltage) across the
measurement cell.
2) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the power
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total power
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0.
3) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
4) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the end of the span to f2 exceeds P1.
5) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
#### 6.5.1.5 Test requirements
The occupied bandwidth shall be less than 5 MHz based on a chip rate of 3,84
Mcps
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in subclause 4.2 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex F.
### 6.5.2 Out of band emission
Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the channel
bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the
transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This out of band emission limit
is specified in terms of a spectrum emission mask and adjacent channel leakage
power ratio for the transmitter.
#### 6.5.2.1 Spectrum emission mask
##### 6.5.2.1.1 Definitions and applicability
The mask defined in Tables 6.18 to 6.21 below may be mandatory in certain
regions. In other regions this mask may not be applied.
For regions where this clause applies, the requirement shall be met by a base
station transmitting on a single RF carrier configured in accordance with the
manufacturer\'s specification.

RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 4.8
1) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex B.\ As a general rule, the
resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity,
efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over
the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of
the measurement bandwidth.
2) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 2,515
MHz and 4.0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.
3) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 4.0
MHz and (f_offset~max~ - 500 kHz).shall use a 1 MHz measurement bandwidth.
4) Detection mode: True RMS.
##### 6.5.2.1.4.2 Procedures

6.1.1.1 at the manufacturer's specified maximum output power.
2) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and
measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified
measurement bandwidth.
##### 6.5.2.1.5 Test requirements
The measurement results in step 2 of 6.5.2.1.4.2 shall not exceed the test
requirements specified in tables 6.18 to 6.21 for the appropriate BS maximum
output power, where:
> \- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal -3 dB
> point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the centre of
the measurement filter;
> \- f_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band edge
> as defined in subclause 3.4.1, whichever is the greater.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value.
#### 6.5.3.7 Test requirements
The measurement result in step 2 of 6.5.3.6.2 shall not exceed the maximum
level specified in tables 6.35 to 6.47 if applicable for the BS under test.
NOTE: If a Test Requirement in this section differs from the corresponding

explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex F.

##### 6.5.3.7.4 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area
These requirements may be applied for the protection of UE, MS and/or BS
operating in other frequency bands in the same geographical area. The
requirements may apply in geographic areas in which both a UTRA FDD BS and a
system operating in another frequency band than the FDD operating band are
deployed. The system operating in the other frequency band may be GSM900,
DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, E-UTRA FDD and/or UTRA FDD.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.38
for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the
first column apply.

### 6.6.1 Definition and applicability
The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements
caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna.
The transmit intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when a WCDMA modulated interference signal is injected into an
antenna connector at a mean power level of 30 dB lower than that of the mean
power of the wanted signal. The frequency of the interference signal shall be
+5 MHz, ‑5 MHz, +10 MHz, ‑10 MHz, +15 MHz and ‑15 MHzoffset from the subject
signal carrier frequency, but exclude interference frequencies that are
outside of the allocated frequency band for UTRA-FDD downlink specified in
subclause 3.4.1.
The requirements are applicable for single carrier.
### 6.6.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 [1] subclause 6.7.
### 6.6.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in its non linear elements caused
by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna to below specified levels.

Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex F
## 6.7 Transmit modulation
### 6.7.1 Error Vector Magnitude
#### 6.7.1.1 Definition and applicability
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Both waveforms pass through a matched Root Raised Cosine filter
with bandwidth 3.84 MHz and roll-off α =0.22. Both waveforms are then further
modified by selecting the frequency, absolute phase, absolute amplitude and
chip clock timing so as to minimise the error vector. The EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %. The measurement interval is one
timeslot as defined by the C-PICH (when present) otherwise the measurement
interval is one timeslot starting with the beginning of the SCH. [
]{.underline} The requirement is valid over the total power dynamic range as
specified in 25.104 [1] subclause 6.4.3. See Annex E of this specification for
further details

this test is defined in subclause 4.2 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex F.
### 6.7.2 Peak Code Domain Error
#### 6.7.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Peak Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector (as
defined in 6.7.1) onto the code domain at a specific spreading factor. The
Code Domain Error for every code in the domain is defined as the ratio of the
mean power of the projection onto that code, to the mean power of the
composite reference waveform. This ratio is expressed in dB. The Peak Code
Domain Error is defined as the maximum value for the Code Domain Error for all
codes. The measurement interval is one timeslot as defined by the C-PICH (when
present), otherwise the measurement interval is one timeslot starting with the
beginning of the SCH. See Annex E of this specification for further details.

Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex F.
### 6.7.3 Time alignment error
#### 6.7.3.1 Definition and applicability
This test is only applicable for Node B supporting TX diversity transmission,
MIMO or DC-HSDPA and their combinations.
Frames of the WCDMA signals present at the BS transmitter antenna port(s) are
not perfectly aligned in time. In relation to each other, the RF signals
present at the BS transmitter antenna port(s) experience certain timing
differences.
For a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode,
Time Alignment Error (TAE) is defined as the largest timing difference between
any two signals.

For Tx diversity and MIMO transmission, in the tested cell, TAE shall not
exceed 0.35 T~c.~
For transmission of multiple cells within a frequency band TAE shall not
exceed 0.6 T~c~.
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in subclause 4.2 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex F.
### 6.7.4 Relative Code Domain Error
#### 6.7.4.1 Definition and applicability

# 8 Performance requirement
## 8.1 General
All Bit Error Ratio (BER) and Block Error ratio (BLER) measurements shall be
carried out according to the general rules for statistical testing defined in
ITU-T Recommendation O.153 [5] and Annex C.
If external BLER measurement is not used then the internal BLER calculation
shall be used instead. When internal BLER calculation is used, the
requirements of the verification test according to 8.6 shall be met in
advance.
Performance requirements are specified for a number of test environments and
multi-path channel classes.
The requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are supported
by the base station. The performance requirements for the high speed train
conditions which scenarios defined in Annex D.4A are optional. For FRC8 in
Annex 9 and Annex 17 the Non E-DPCCH boosting and E-DPCCH boosting requirement
only apply for the option supported by the base station.
For BS with dual receiver antenna diversity, only the BS performance
requirements with Rx diversity are to be tested, the required E~b~/N~0~ shall
be applied separately at each antenna port.
For BS without receiver antenna diversity, only the BS performance
requirements without Rx diversity are to be tested, the required E~b~/N~0~
shall be applied at the BS Rx antenna port.
In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may be
provided, from the base station to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.
## 8.2 Demodulation in static propagation conditions
### 8.2.1 Demodulation of DCH
#### 8.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of DCH in static propagation conditions is
determined by the maximum Block Error Ratio (BLER ) allowed when the receiver
input signal is at a specified E~b~/N~0~ limit. The BLER is calculated for
each of the measurement channels supported by the base station.
#### 8.2.1.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 [1] subclause 8.2.1.1.
Table 8.1: (void)
#### 8.2.1.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to receive the test signal under
static propagation conditions with a BLER not exceeding a specified limit.
#### 8.2.1.4 Method of test
##### 8.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause 4.4.1.

###### ## Annex C (normative): General rules for statistical testing
# C.1 Statistical testing of receiver BER/BLER performance
## C.1.1 Error Definition
Bit Error Ration (BER) and Block Error Ratio (BLER) are defined in section
3.1.
## C.1.2 Test Method
Each test is performed in the following manner:
a) Setup the required test conditions.
b) Record the number of samples tested and the number of occurred events (bit
error or block error)
c) Stop the test at a stop criterion which is minimum test time or an early
pass or an early fail event.
d) Once the test is stopped decide according to the pass fail decision rules (
subclause C.1.7)
## C.1.3 Test Criteria
The test shall fulfil the following requirements:
a) good pass fail decision
1) to keep reasonably low the probability (risk) of passing a bad unit for
each individual test;
2) to have high probability of passing a good unit for each individual test;
b) good balance between test time and statistical significance
3) to perform measurements with a high degree of statistical significance;
4) to keep the test time as low as possible.
## C.1.4 Calculation assumptions
### C.1.4.1 Statistical independence
a) It is assumed, that error events are rare (lim BER BLER  0) independent
statistical events. However the memory of the convolutional /turbo coder is
terminated after one TTI. Samples and errors are summed up every TTI. So the
assumption of independent error events is justified.
b) In the BLER test with fading there is the memory of the multipath fading
channel which interferes the statistical independence. A minimum test time is
introduced to average fluctuations of the multipath fading channel. So the
assumption of independent error events is justified approximately.
### C.1.4.2 Applied formulas
The formulas, applied to describe the BER BLER test, are based on the
following experiments:
1) After having observed a certain number of errors (**ne**) the number of
samples are counted to calculate BER BLER. Provisions are made (note 1) such
that the complementary experiment is valid as well:
2) After a certain number of samples (**ns**) the number of errors, occurred,
are counted to calculate BER BLER.
Experiment 1) stipulates to use the following Chi Square Distribution with
degree of freedom ne:
2*dchisq(2*NE,2*ne).
Experiment 2) stipulates to use the Poisson Distribution:
dpois(ne,NE)
(NE: mean of the distribution)
To determine the early stop conditions, the following inverse cumulative
operation is applied:
0.5 * qchisq(D,2*ne). This is applicable for experiment (1) and (2).
D: wrong decision risk per test step
NOTE: Other inverse cumulative operations are available, however only this is
suited for experiment (1) and (2).
### C.1.4.3 Approximation of the distribution
The test procedure is as follows:
During a running measurement for a UE ns (number of samples) and ne (number of
errors) are accumulated and from this the preliminary BER BLER is calculated.
Then new samples up to the next error are taken. The entire past and the new
samples are basis for the next preliminary BER BLER. Depending on the result
at every step, the UE can pass, can fail or must continue the test.
As early pass- and early fail-UEs leave the statistical totality under
consideration, the experimental conditions are changed every step resulting in
a distribution that is truncated more and more towards the end of the entire
test. Such a distribution can not any more be handled analytically. The
unchanged distribution is used as an approximation to calculate the early fail
and early pass bounds.
## C.1.5 Definition of good pass fail decision.
This is defined by the probability of wrong decision F at the end of the test.
The probability of a correct decision is 1-F.
The probability (risk) to fail a good DUT shall be ≤ F according to the
following definition: The failed DUT is still better than the specified error
ratio (Test requirement)with a probability of ≤ F.
The probability to pass a bad DUT shall be ≤ F according to the following
definition: The passed DUT is still worse than M times the specified error
ratio (M>1 is the bad DUT factor) with a probability of ≤ F.
This definitions lead to an early pass and an early fail limit:
Early fail: ber≥ berlim~fail~
$\text{ber}\text{lim}_{\text{fail}}(D,\text{ne}) = \frac{2 \ast
\text{ne}}{\text{qchisq}(D,2 \ast \text{ne})}$ (1)
For ne≥7
Early pass: ber ≤berlimbad~pass~
$\text{ber}\text{lim}\text{bad}_{\text{pass}}(D,\text{ne}) = \frac{2 \ast
\text{ne} \ast M}{\text{qchisq}(1 - D,2 \ast \text{ne})}$ (2)
For ne ≥ 1

## C.1.6 Good balance between test time and statistical significance
Three independent test parameters are introduced into the test and shown in
Table C.1. These are the obvious basis of test time and statistical
significance. From the first two of them four dependent test parameters are

The minimum test time is derived from the following justification:
1) For no propagation conditions and static propagation condition
No early fail calculated from fractional number of errors \ Scenario 1: 82.3s. This corresponds to 4 complete cycles of approach towards
> and departure leave to and from a BS antenna
>
> Scenario 2: The test shall continue until 990 wavelengths are crossed with
> the speed given in the fading profile (1.8s corresponding 300 km/h)
>
> Scenario 3: 28.8s. This corresponds to 4 complete cycles of approach towards

In table C.3 to C.9 the minimum test time is converted in minimum number of
samples.
## C.1.7 Pass fail decision rules
No decision is allowed before the minimum test time is elapsed.
1) If minimum Test time \345.
A typical BER BLER test, calculated form the number of samples and errors
(C.1.2.(b)) using experimental method (1) or (2) (see C.1.4.2 calculation
assumptions) runs along the yellow trajectory. With an errorless sample the
trajectory goes down vertically. With an erroneous sample it jumps up right.
The tester checks if the BER BLER test intersects the early fail or early pass
limits. The real time processing can be reduced by the following actions:
BLER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test (Note
1)). is calculated only in case of an error event.
BER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test (Note 1)).
is calculated only in case of an error event within a TTI.
So the early fail limit cannot be missed by errorless samples.
The check against the early pass limit may be done by transforming formula (2)
in C.1.5 such that the tester checks against a
[L]{.underline}imit-[N]{.underline}umber-of-samples ( NL(ne)) depending on the
current number of errors (including the artificial error at the beginning of
the test (Note 1)).
Early pass if
$\text{NL}(\text{ne}) \geq \frac{\text{qchisq}(1 - D,2 \ast \text{ne})}{2 \ast
\text{TR} \ast M}$
TR: test requirement (0.001)
Figure C.1.9
NOTE 1: At the beginning of the test, an artificial error is introduced. This
ensures that an ideal DUT meets the valid range of the early pass limit. In
addition this ensures that the complementary experiment (C.1.4.2 bullet point
(2)) is applicable as well.\ For the check against the early fail limit the
artificial erroneous sample, introduced at the beginning of the test , is
disregarded.\ Due to the nature of the test, namely discrete error events, the
early fail condition shall not be valid, when fractional errors \1/2
exhibits limited selectivity. The Bad DUT factor ≠ 1 is a measure of limited
selectivity.
Data throughput in a communication system is of statistical nature and must be
measured and decided pass or fail. The specified limit of throughput related
to the ideal throughput in different throughput tests is in the range of a few
% to near 100%. To make it comparable with BER, we define the complement of
the relative throughput: BLER as defined above. Complementary this is in the
range of near 100% down to a few % For e.g. BLER = 1%, the currently in BER
BLER used Bad DUT factor M=1.5 is highly meaningful. For e.g. BLER = 99%, the
currently used M=1.5 is obviously meaningless.
An appropriate definition of the bad DUT factor is illustrated in figure
C.2.3: constant and variable Bad DUT factor.
It illustrates how to find the Bad BLER when the nominal BLER is given.
1) In the range 0%\10% the Bad DUT factor is constant 1.5
2) In the range 90%\100% it decreases to 1. (symmetrical to (1))
3) The range in between is interpolated by an arc section.
The example shows: nominal BLER=35,6%  bad BLER=47.67.5%  M=1.34

The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance are 2
non fading propagation channels (scenario 1 and 3) and 1 fading propagation
channel (scenario 2) with one tap. For BS with Rx diversity defined in
scenario 1, the Doppler shift variation is the same between antennas.
For scenario 1 and 3, Doppler shift is given by
$f_{s}\left( t \right) = f_{d}\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right)$ (D.2)
where $f_{s}\left( t \right)$ is the Doppler shift and $f_{d}$ is the maximum
Doppler frequency. The cosine of angle $\theta\left( t \right)$is given by
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{D_{s}/2 -
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( D_{s}/2 - \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $0 \leq t \leq D_{s}/v$ (D.3)
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{- 1\text{.}5D_{s} +
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( - 1\text{.}5D_{s} + \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $D_{s}/v  2D_{s}/v$ (D.5)
where $D_{s}/2$ is the initial distance of the train from BS, and
$D_{\text{min}}$ is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters; $v$ is the
velocity of the train in m/s, $t$ is time in seconds.
For scenario 2, Rician fading is considered where Rician factor, _K_ is
defined as the ratio between the dominant signal power and the variant of the
other weaker signals.
Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equation D.2 and D.3-D.5
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in table D.2A and the
resulting Doppler shift shown in Figure D.3 and D.4 are applied for all
frequency bands.

###### ## Annex E (normative): Global In-Channel TX-Test
# E.1 General
The global in-channel Tx test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of the Tx
under test in a single measurement process. The parameters describing the in-
channel quality of a transmitter, however, are not necessarily independent.
The algorithm chosen for description inside this annex places particular
emphasis on the exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters. Any
other algorithm (e.g. having better computational efficiency) may be applied,
as long as the results are the same within the acceptable uncertainty of the
test system as defined in subclause 4.1
# E.2 Definition of the process
## E.2.1 Basic principle
The process is based on the comparison of the actual **output signal of the TX
under test** , received by an ideal receiver, with a **reference signal** ,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error
free received signal. The reference signal shall be composed of the same
number of codes at the correct spreading factors as contained In the test
signal. Note, for simplification, the notation below assumes only codes of one
spreading factor although the algorithm is valid for signals containing
multiple spreading factors. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.
## E.2.2 Output signal of the TX under test
The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring equipment,
filtered by a matched filter (RRC 0.22, correct in shape and in position on
the frequency axis) and stored for further processing
The following form represents the physical signa l in the entire measurement
interval:
one vector **Z** , containing N = ns x sf complex samples;
with
ns: [n]{.underline}umber of [s]{.underline}ymbols in the measurement interval;
sf: number of chips per symbol. (sf: [s]{.underline}preading
[f]{.underline}actor) (see Note: Symbol length)
## E.2.3 Reference signal
The reference signal is constructed by the measuring equipment according to
the relevant TX specifications.
It is filtered by the same matched filter, mentioned in E.2.2., and stored at
the Inter-Symbol-Interference free instants. The following form represents the
reference signal in the entire measurement interval:
one vector **R** , containing N = ns x sf complex samples
where
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval;
sf: number of chips per symbol. (see Note: Symbol length)
## E.2.4 Classification of measurement results
The measurement results achieved by the global in-channel TX test can be
classified into two types:
\- Results of type \"deviation\", where the error-free parameter has a non-
zero magnitude. (These are the parameters that quantify the integral physical
characteristic of the signal).These parameters are:
RF Frequency
Power (in case of single code)
Code Domain Power (in case of multi code)
Timing (only for UE) (see Note: Deviation)
(Additional parameters: see Note: Deviation)
\- Results of type \"residual\", where the error-free parameter has value
zero. (These are the parameters that quantify the error values of the measured
signal, whose ideal magnitude is zero). These parameters are:
Error Vector Magnitude (EVM);
Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE).
(Additional parameters: see Note: Residual)
## E.2.5 Process definition to achieve results of type \"deviation\"
The reference signal (**R** ; see subclause E.2.3) and the signal under Test
(Z; see subclause E.2.2) are varied with respect to the parameters mentioned
in subclause E.2.4 under \"results of type deviation\" in order to achieve
best fit. Best fit is achieved when the RMS difference value between the
varied signal under test and the varied reference signal is an absolute
minimum.
Overview:
$\text{FCT}\lbrack
Z(\overset{\sim}{f},\overset{\sim}{t},\overset{\sim}{\phi},g_{1},g_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g_{\text{synch}})
-
R(f,t,\phi,{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{1},{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{synch}})\rbrack
= \text{Minimum}!$
Z : Signal under test.
R: Reference signal,
with frequency f, the timing t, the phase ϕ, gain of code1 (g~1~), gain of
code2 (g~2~) etc, and the gain of the synch channel g~synch~ See Note: Power
Step
The parameters marked with a tilde in Z and R are varied in order to achieve a
best fit.
For most measurement results the best fit process is to be carried out over
the whole measurement interval corresponding to the duration of one slot, i.e.
ns * sf = 2560 chips in E.2.2 and E.2.3. Some measurements are, however,
defined for a measurement interval corresponding to the duration of one frame,
i.e. ns * sf = 38400 chips. In this latter case, the best fit with respect to
**Z** and **R** is to be carried out successively over multiple best fit
intervals (segments) corresponding to the duration of one slot each, i.e. 15
times for a measurement interval corresponding to the duration of one frame.
Detailed formula: see Note: Formula for the minimum process
The varied reference signal, after the best fit process, will be called
**R'.**
The varied signal under test, after the best fit process, will be called
**Z'.**
**R'** and **Z'** are each of length ns * sf and depending on the length of
the measurement interval result of possibly multiple successive applications
of the minimum process.
The varying parameters, leading to **R' and Z** represent directly the wanted
results of type \"deviation\". These measurement parameters are expressed as
deviation from the reference value with the same units as the reference value.
In the case of multi code, the type-\"deviation\"-parameters (frequency,
timing and (RF-phase)) are varied commonly for all codes such that the process
returns one frequency-deviation, one timing deviation, (one RF-phase
-deviation).
(These parameters are [not]{.underline} varied on the individual code signals
such that the process would return kr frequency errors... . (kr: number of
codes)).
The only type-\"deviation\"-parameters varied individually are the code domain
gain factors (g1, g2, ...)
See Note: Power Step.
### E.2.5.1 Decision Point Power
The mean-square value of the signal-under-test, sampled at the best estimate
of the of Intersymbol-Interference-free points using the process defined in
subclause 2.5, is referred to the _Decision Point Power_ (DPP):
### E.2.5.2 Code-Domain Power
The samples, Z', are separated into symbol intervals to create ns time-
sequential vectors **z** with sf complex samples comprising one symbol
interval. The _Code Domain Power_ is calculated according to the following
steps:
1) Take the vectors **z** defined above.
2) To achieve meaningful results it is necessary to descramble **z,** leading
to **z'** (see Note: Scrambling code)
3) Take the orthogonal vectors of the channelization code set **C** (all codes
belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213 and TS 25.223
(range +1, -1), and normalize by the norm of the vectors to produce **C**
norm=**C** /sqrt(sf). (see Note: Symbol length)
4) Calculate the inner product of **z'** with **C** norm**.**. Do this for all
symbols of the measurement interval and for all codes in the code space.\ This
gives an array of format k x ns, each value representing a specific symbol and
a specific code, which can be exploited in a variety of ways.
k: total number of codes in the code space
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval
5) Calculate k mean-square values, each mean-square value unifying ns symbols
within one code.\ (These values can be called \"_Absolute CodeDomainPower_
(CDP)\" [Volt^2^].) The sum of the k values of CDP is equal to DPP.
6) Normalize by the decision point power to obtain
## E.2.6 Process definition to achieve results of type \"residual\"
The difference between the varied reference signal (**R'** ; see
subclauseE.2.5.) and the varied TX signal under test (**Z'** ; see
subclauseE.2.5) is the error vector **E** versus time:
**E** = **Z'** \- **R'**
Depending on the parameter to be evaluated, it is appropriate to represent
**E** in one of the following two different forms:
[Form EVM]{.underline} (representing the physical error signal in the entire
measurement interval)
One vector **E** , containing N = ns x sf complex samples;
with
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval
sf: number of chips per symbol (see Note: Symbol length)
[Form PCDE]{.underline} (derived from Form EVM by separating the samples into
symbol intervals)
ns time-sequential vectors **e** with sf complex samples comprising one symbol
interval.
**E** and **e** give results of type \"residual\" applying the two algorithms
defined in subclauses E.2.6.1 and E.2.6.2.
### E.2.6.1 Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
The Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is calculated according to the following
steps:
1) Take the error vector **E** defined in subclause E.2.6 (Form EVM) and
calculate the RMS value of **E** ; the result will be called RMS(**E**).
2) Take the varied reference vector **R'** defined in subclause E.2.5 and
calculate the RMS value of **R'** ; the result will be called RMS(**R'**).
3) Calculate EVM according to:
$\text{EVM} = \frac{\text{RMS}(E)}{\text{RMS}(R')}\text{\ x\ 100\%}\frac{}{}$
(here, EVM is relative and expressed in %)
(see Note: Formula for EVM)
### E.2.6.2 Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE)
The Peak Code Domain Error is calculated according to the following steps:
1) Take the error vectors **e** defined in subclause E.2.6 (Form PCDE)
2) To achieve meaningful results it is necessary to descramble **e,** leading
to **e'** (see Note: Scrambling code)
3) Take the orthogonal vectors of the channelization code set **C** (all codes
belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213 and TS 25.223
(range +1, -1). (see Note: Symbol length) and normalize by the norm of the
vectors to produce **C** norm= **C** /sqrt(sf). (see Note: Symbol length)
4) Calculate the inner product of **e'** with **Cnorm**. Do this for all
symbols of the measurement interval and for all codes in the code space.\ This
gives an array of format k x ns, each value representing an error-vector
representing a specific symbol and a specific code, which can be exploited in
a variety of ways.
k: total number of codes in the code space
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval
5) Calculate k RMS values, each RMS value unifying ns symbols within one
code.\ (These values can be called \"_Absolute CodeEVMs_ \" [Volt].)
6) Find the peak value among the k \"_Absolute CodeEVMs_ \".\ (This value can
be called \"_Absolute PeakCodeEVM_ \" [Volt].)
7) Calculate PCDE according to:
$\text{10} \ast \text{lg}\frac{(\text{\ ital\ }\text{Absolute}\text{\ ital\
}\text{PeakCodeEVM})^{2}}{(\text{RMS}(R'))^{2}}\text{dB}$ (a relative value in
dB).
(see Note IQ)
(see Note Synch channel)
### E.2.6.3 Relative Code Domain Error (RCDE)
The Relative Code Domain Error is calculated for a wanted code according to
the following steps:
1) Calculate the value \"_Absolute CodeEVM_ \" [Volt] for the wanted code
according to E.2.6.2, as an RMS value unifying ns = 2400 symbols corresponding
to the measurement interval of 1 frame.
2) Calculate the value \"_Absolute CodeDomainPower_ (CDP)\" [Volt^2^] for the
wanted code according to E.2.5.2, with ns = 2400 symbols corresponding to the
measurement interval of 1 frame.
3) Calculate RCDE according to:
4) The average RCDE across a set of wanted codes is defined as the mean of the
linear RCDE values and subsequently expressed in dB.
# E.3 Notes
## E.3.1 Symbol length
A general code multiplexed signal is multicode and multirate. In order to
avoid unnecessary complexity, the measurement applications use a unique
symbol-length, corresponding to a spreading factor, regardless of the really
intended spreading factor. Nevertheless the complexity with a multicode /
multirate signal can be mastered by introducing appropriate definitions.
## E.3.2 Deviation
It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type \"deviation\" e.g. Chip
frequency and RF-phase.
As chip-frequency and RF-frequency are linked together by a statement in the
core specifications [1] it is sufficient to process RF frequency only.
A parameter RF-phase must be varied within the best fit process (E.2.5.).
Although necessary, this parameter-variation doesn't describe any error, as
the modulation schemes used in the system don't depend on an absolute RF-
phase.
The parameter Timing must be varied within the best fit process (E.2.5.) This
parameter variation does not describe any error, when applied to the Node B
test. However when applied to the UE test, it describes the error of the UE's
Timing Advance.
## E.3.3 Residual
It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type „residual\" e.g. IQ origin
offset. As it is not the intention of the test to separate for different error
sources, but to quantify the quality of the signal, all such parameters are
not extracted by the best fit process, instead remain part of EVM and PCDE.
## E.3.4 Scrambling Code
In general a signal under test can use more than one scrambling code. Note
that PCDE is primarily processed to investigate the unused channelization
codes. In order to know which scrambling code shall be applied on unused
channelization codes, it is necessary to restrict the test conditions: The
signal under test shall use exactly one scrambling code.
## E.3.5 IQ
As in FDD/uplink each channelization code can be used twice, on the I and on
the Q channel, the measurement result may indicate separate values of CDP or
PCDE for I and Q on which channel (I or Q) they occur.
## E.3.6 Synch Channel
A Node B signal contains a physical synch channel, which is non orthogonal,
related to the other channels. In this context note: The code channel bearing
the result of PCDE is exactly one of the other physical channels (never the
synch channel). The origin of PCDE (erroneous code power) can be any channel
(including synch channel) This means that the error due to the synch channel
is projected onto the other (orthogonal) codes that make up the code domain.
## E.3.7 Formula for the minimum process
$L(\Delta\overset{\sim}{f},\Delta\overset{\sim}{t},\Delta\overset{\sim}{\phi},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{c},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}})
= \sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|Z(\nu) - R(\nu)}|^{2}$
where:
L : the function to be minimised
The parameters to be varied in order to minimize are:
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{f}$ the RF frequency offset
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t}$ the timing offset
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{\phi}$ the phase offset
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{c}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}$ code power offsets
(one offset for each code)
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}}$ the code power offset of the primary
SCH
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}}$ the code power offset of the
secondary SCH
Z(ν) Samples of the signal under Test
R(ν) Samples of the reference signal
$\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{}$ counting index $\nu$starting at the beginning of
the best fit interval and ending at its end.
N No of chips during the best fit interval.
Z(ν): Samples of the signal under Test. It is modelled as a sequence of
complex baseband samples Z(γ) with a time-shift ∆t, a frequency offset ∆f, a
phase offset ∆ϕ, the latter three with respect to the reference signal.
$Z(\nu) = Z(\nu - \Delta\overset{\sim}{t}) \ast e^{-
j2\text{πΔ}\overset{\sim}{f}\nu} \ast e^{- \text{jΔ}\overset{\sim}{\phi}}$
R(ν) Samples of the reference signal:
$\text{codes} + (g_{\text{prim}} + \Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}})
\ast \text{Chip}_{\text{prim}}(\nu) + (g_{\text{sec}} +
\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}}) \ast \text{Chip}_{\text{sec}}(\nu)$
where
g nominal gain of the code channel
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{g}$ The gain offset to be varied in the minimum process
Chip(ν) is the chipsequence of the code channel
Indices at g, Δg and Chip: The index indicates the code channel: c = 1,2,...
No of code channels
prim= primary SCH
sec= secondary SCH
Range for Chip~c~ : +1,-1
## E.3.8 Power Step
If the measurement period for any code contains a power step due to power
control, it is necessary to model the reference signal for that code using two
gain factors.
## E.3.9 Formula for EVM
$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|Z^{'}(\gamma) -
R^{'}(\gamma)}|^{2}}{\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|R^{'}(\gamma)}|^{2}}} \ast
\text{100}\text{\%}$
Z'(γ), R'(γ) are the varied measured and reference signals.
###### ## Annex F (informative): Derivation of Test Requirements
The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by relaxing
the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the Test Tolerances
defined in subclause 4.2. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the Test
Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement. When the Test
Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ from the Minimum
Requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in tables F.1,
F.2 and F.3
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case that
the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in subclause 4.1. In
this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test
tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened Test Requirements as
defined in subclause 4.3.
For example, a Test System having 0.9 dB accuracy for test 6.2.1 Base Station
maximum output power (which is 0.2 dB above the limit specified in subclause
4.) would subtract 0.2 dB from the Test Tolerance of 0.7 dB defined in
subclause 4.2. This new test tolerance of 0.5 dB would then be applied to the
Minimum Requirement using the formula defined in Table F.1 to give a new range
of ±2.5 dB of the manufacturer\'s rated output power.
Using this same approach for the case where a test had a test tolerance of 0
dB, an excess error of 0.2 dB would result in a modified test tolerance of
-0.2 dB.

###### ## Annex G (informative): Acceptable uncertainty of Test Equipment
This informative annex specifies the critical parameters of the components of
an overall Test System (e.g. Signal generators, Signal Analysers etc.) which
are necessary when assembling a Test System which complies with subclause 4.1
Acceptable Uncertainty of Test System. These Test Equipment parameters are
fundamental to the accuracy of the overall Test System and are unlikely to be

###### ## Annex H (Informative): UTRAN Measurement Test Cases
# H.1 Purpose of Annex
This Annex specifies test specific parameters for some of the UTRAN
requirements in chapter 9.2 TS 25.133. The tests provide additional
information to how the requirements should be tested. Some requirements may
lack a test.
Unless explicitly stated:
> \- Measurement channel is 12.2 kbps as defined in TS 25.104 annex A, sub-
> clause A.2 for UL measurements
>
> \- Test models defined in TS 25.141 sub-clause 6.1 are used for DL
> measurements
# H.2 Received Total Wideband Power
## H.2.1 Absolute RTWP measurement
1\. Terminate the BS RX inputs, measure the RTWP and record it.
2\. Connect a signal generator and increase the signal generator power until
the reported RTWP level (Irep) has increased 3 dB.
3\. Measure the signal level power at the antenna connector port. This signal
level is now called the \"Internally generated noise\" (Ni).
4\. Sweep the sum of internally generated noise (Ni) and signal generator
power (I) through the defined accuracy range.
5\. Check that: \|(Ni+I)-Irep\| meets the requirements in chapter 9.2.1.
Note that Io= (Ni+I)
## H.2.2 Relative RTWP measurement
1\. Terminate the BS RX inputs, measure the RTWP and record it.
2\. Attach a signal generator to the RX input and increase the power until the
by the BS reported RTWP value (Irep) has increased 3 dB.
3\. Measure the signal level power at the antenna connector port. This signal
level is now called the \"Internally generated noise\" (Ni).
4\. Calculate the required signal levels I such that the sum of the internally
generated noise (Ni) and the signal generator power (I)
5\. The difference between the reported RTWP values shall meet the
requirements specified in chapter 9.2.1.
# H.3 Transmitted code power
1\. Generate the wanted signal in accordance to test model 2, subclause
6.1.1.2. Set power of the DPCH under test to the Pmax-3 dB level. Power levels
for other code channels shall be adjusted as necessary.
2\. Measure the output power on code channel under test, Pout,code, at the
antenna connector. Record the transmitted code power reported in the BS,
Pcode.
3\. Check that Pout,code meets the absolute accuracy requirement in TS 25.133
chapter 9.2.5.1. If STTD or closed loop transmit diversity is supported by the
BS, the transmitted code power for each branch are measured, summed together
and reported to higher layers. In case of TX diversity or MIMO transmission
both branches need to be measured and summed together in order to find out the
wanted value. The absolute accuracy of Pcode can be accepted if Pout,code will
fullfill the following conditions:
Pcode-3.9 dB ≤ Pout,code ≤ Pcode + 3.9 dB
4\. Check that the relative accuracy requirement for Pcode in TS 25.133
chapter 9.2.5.2 is met. Set Pcode1 and Pcode2 to transmit with the same power
level. The relative accuracy between Pcode1 and Pcode2 can be accepted if the
difference between the measured power of one code channel, Pout,code1 and
another code channel Pout,code 2 will fullfill the following conditions:
 Pout,code1 - Pout,code2  ≤ 2.2 dB.
5\. Set the power of the DPCH under test to the minimum power of the power
control dynamic range and repeat steps 2, 3 and 4.
# H.4 Transmitted carrier power
1) Set the BS to transmit with the maximum transmission power and measure the
output power at the antenna connector, PMTP. Maximum transmission power is the
mean power on one carrier measured at the antenna connector with the code
level settings that according to the base station manufacturer will result in
an output power of nominally the maximum output power in a specified reference
condition. Test model 2, subclause 6.1.1.2, when the code powers are set
according to table 6.3. shall be used.
2) Operate the BS in closed loop power control until the output power has
reached a stable state. Measure the output power, Pout, at the antenna
connector and record the transmitted carrier power measured and reported in
the BS, Prep. Note that Prep is normalised to the output power measured in
Test Model 2 with all codes at their default levels. If STTD or closed loop
transmit diversity is supported by the BS, only the highest of the transmit
powers is reported to higher layers. In case of TX diversity or MIMO
transmission both branches need to be measured in order to find out which one
is the highest.
3) Check that the Pout meets the requirement in TS 25.133 chapter 9.2.4.1,
with the same test equipment accuracy as in chapter 6.4.4. in TS 25.141. Prep
can be accepted if Pout will fullfill the following conditions:
$\text{PMTP} + \text{10}\text{log}\left( \frac{\text{Pr}\text{ep} -
5}{\text{100}} \right) - 0\text{.}3 \leq \text{Pout}\text{PMTP} +
\text{10}\text{log}\left( \frac{\text{Pr}\text{ep} + 5}{\text{100}} \right) +
0\text{.}3$ [ dBm]
4) Repeat step 2 and 3 over the 5%-95% range of the Prep. Use first the
standard code powers of test model 2 to verify the Prep range from 50% to 95%.
After that put the other dedicated channels off and reduce the powers of the
control codes in order to be able to verify the Prep range from 5% to 50%.
NOTE: Pout shall be tested immediately after PMTP in order to avoid the
influence of long term stability variation to measurement results.
###### ## Annex I (normative): Characteristics of the W-CDMA interference
signal
The W-CDMA interference signal shall be a DPCH containing the DPCCH and one
DPDCH. The data content for each channelization code shall be uncorrelated
with each other and to the wanted signal and spread and modulated according to
clause 4 of TS25.213 [14]. Further characteristics of DPDCH and DPCCH are
specified in table I.1.
