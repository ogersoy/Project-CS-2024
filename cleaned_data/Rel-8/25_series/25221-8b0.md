# 4 Services offered to higher layers
## 4.1 Transport channels
Transport channels are the services offered by layer 1 to the higher layers. A
transport channel is defined by how and with what characteristics data is
transferred over the air interface. A general classification of transport
channels is into two groups:
\- Dedicated Channels, using inherent addressing of UE
\- Common Channels, using explicit addressing of UE if addressing is needed
General concepts about transport channels are described in [12].
### 4.1.1 Dedicated transport channels
There exists two types of dedicated transport channel, the Dedicated Channel
(DCH) and the Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH).
#### 4.1.1.1 DCH -- Dedicated Channel
The Dedicated Channel (DCH) is an up- or downlink transport channel that is
used to carry user or control information between the UTRAN and a UE.
#### 4.1.1.2 E-DCH -- Enhanced Dedicated Channel
The Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel.
### 4.1.2 Common transport channels
There are seven types of common transport channels for 3.84Mcps and 7.68Mcps
TDD: BCH, FACH, PCH, RACH, USCH, DSCH, HS-DSCH.
There are eight types of common transport channels for 1.28Mcps TDD: BCH,
FACH, PCH, RACH, USCH, DSCH, HS-DSCH, E-DCH.
#### 4.1.2.1 BCH - Broadcast Channel
The Broadcast Channel (BCH) is a downlink transport channel that is used to
broadcast system- and cell-specific information.
#### 4.1.2.2 FACH -- Forward Access Channel
The Forward Access Channel (FACH) is a downlink transport channel that is used
to carry control information to a mobile station when the system knows the
location cell of the mobile station. The FACH may also carry short user
packets.
#### 4.1.2.3 PCH -- Paging Channel
The Paging Channel (PCH) is a downlink transport channel that is used to carry
control information to a mobile station when the system does not know the
location cell of the mobile station.
#### 4.1.2.4 RACH -- Random Access Channel
The Random Access Channel (RACH) is an up link transport channel that is used
to carry control information from mobile station. The RACH may also carry
short user packets.
#### 4.1.2.5 USCH -- Uplink Shared Channel
The uplink shared channel (USCH) is an uplink transport channel shared by
several UEs carrying dedicated control or traffic data.
#### 4.1.2.6 DSCH -- Downlink Shared Channel
The downlink shared channel (DSCH) is a downlink transport channel shared by
several UEs carrying dedicated control or traffic data.
#### 4.1.2.7 HS-DSCH -- High Speed Downlink Shared Channel
The High Speed Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) is a downlink transport
channel shared by several UEs. The HS-DSCH is associated with one or several
Shared Control Channels (HS-SCCH). The HS-DSCH is transmitted over the entire
cell or over only part of the cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.
For 1.28Mcps TDD, in a multi-frequency HS-DSCH cell, the HS-DSCH may be
transmitted to a UE on one or more carriers in CELL_DCH state and on only one
carrier in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH state in a TTI. The term 'multi-
carrier HS-DSCH reception' refers to the HS-DSCH reception on multiple
carriers in a TTI for a UE.
#### 4.1.2.8 E-DCH -- Enhanced Dedicated Channel
The Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in
CELL_FACH and IDLE mode for 1.28Mcps TDD only.
## 4.2 Indicators
Indicators are means of fast low-level signalling entities which are
transmitted without using information blocks sent over transport channels. The
meaning of indicators is implicit to the receiver.
The indicator(s) defined in the current version of the specifications are:
Paging Indicator (PI) and MBMS Notification Indicator (NI).
# 5 Physical channels for the 3.84 Mcps option
Sub-clauses 5.1 to 5.7 do not apply to 3.84 Mcps MBSFN IMB. Sub-clause 5.8
describes physical channels for 3.84 Mcps MBSFN IMB.
All physical channels take three-layer structure with respect to timeslots,
radio frames and system frame numbering (SFN), see [14]. Depending on the
resource allocation, the configuration of radio frames or timeslots becomes
different. All physical channels need a guard period in every timeslot. The
time slots are used in the sense of a TDMA component to separate different
user signals in the time domain. The physical channel signal format is
presented in figure 1.
A physical channel in TDD is a burst, which is transmitted in a particular
timeslot within allocated Radio Frames. The allocation can be continuous, i.e.
the time slot in every frame is allocated to the physical channel or
discontinuous, i.e. the time slot in a subset of all frames is allocated only.
A burst is the combination of two data parts, a midamble part and a guard
period. The duration of a burst is one time slot. Several bursts can be
transmitted at the same time from one transmitter. In this case, the data
parts must use different OVSF channelisation codes, but the same scrambling
code. The midamble parts are either identicaly or differently shifted versions
of a cell-specific basic midamble code, see section 5.2.3. Note when in MBSFN
operation, a midamble is not necessarily cell-specific.
{width="5.478472222222222in" height="1.3854166666666667in"}
Figure 1: Physical channel signal format
The data part of the burst is spread with a combination of channelisation code
and scrambling code. The channelisation code is a OVSF code, that can have a
spreading factor of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. The data rate of the physical channel
is depending on the used spreading factor of the used OVSF code.
The midamble part of the burst can contain two different types of midambles: a
short one of length 256 chips, or a long one of 512 chips. The data rate of
the physical channel is depending on the used midamble length. Additionally,
when in MBSFN operation a midamble of length 320 chips is used.
So a physical channel is defined by frequency, timeslot, channelisation code,
burst type and Radio Frame allocation. The scrambling code and the basic
midamble code are broadcast and may be constant within a cell. When a physical
channel is established, a start frame is given. The physical channels can
either be of infinite duration, or a duration for the allocation can be
defined.
## 5.1 Frame structure
The TDMA frame has a duration of 10 ms and is subdivided into 15 time slots
(TS) of 2560*T~c~ duration each. A time slot corresponds to 2560 chips. The
physical content of the time slots are the bursts of corresponding length as
described in subclause 5.2.2.
Each 10 ms frame consists of 15 time slots, each allocated to either the
uplink or the downlink (figure 2). With such a flexibility, the TDD mode can
be adapted to different environments and deployment scenarios. In any
configuration at least one time slot has to be allocated for the downlink and
at least one time slot has to be allocated for the uplink with the exception
of no uplink timeslots when the entire carrier is dedicted to MBSFN

## 5.2 Dedicated physical channel (DPCH)
The DCH as described in subclause 4.1.1 is mapped onto the dedicated physical
channel.
### 5.2.1 Spreading
Spreading is applied to the data part of the physical channels and consists of
two operations. The first is the channelisation operation, which transforms
every data symbol into a number of chips, thus increasing the bandwidth of the
signal. The number of chips per data symbol is called the Spreading Factor
(SF). The second operation is the scrambling operation, where a scrambling
code is applied to the spread signal. Details on channelisation and scrambling
operation can be found in [8].
#### 5.2.1.1 Spreading for Downlink Physical Channels
Downlink physical channels shall use SF =16. Multiple parallel physical
channels can be used to support higher data rates. These parallel physical
channels shall be transmitted using different channelisation codes, see [8].
These codes with SF =16 are generated as described in [8].
Operation with a single code with spreading factor 1 is possible for the
downlink physical channels.
#### 5.2.1.2 Spreading for Uplink Physical Channels
The range of spreading factor that may be used for uplink physical channels
shall range from 16 down to 1. For each physical channel an individual minimum
spreading factor SF~min~ is transmitted by means of the higher layers. There
are two options that are indicated by UTRAN:
1\. The UE shall use the spreading factor SF~min~, independent of the current
TFC.
2\. The UE shall autonomously increase the spreading factor depending on the
current TFC.
If the UE autonomously changes the SF, it shall always vary the channelisation
code along the branch with the higher code numbering of the allowed OVSF sub
tree, as depicted in [8]. In the event that code hopping is configured by
higher layers, the allowed OVSF sub-tree is that subtended by the effective
allocated OVSF code after the hop sequence has been applied to the allocated
OVSF code (see [9]).
For multicode transmission a UE shall use a maximum of two physical channels
per timeslot simultaneously. These two parallel physical channels shall be
transmitted using different channelisation codes, see [8].
### 5.2.2 Burst Types
Four types of bursts for dedicated physical channels are defined. All of them
consist of two data symbol fields, a midamble and a guard period, the lengths
of which are different for the individual burst types. Thus, the number of
data symbols in a burst depends on the SF and the burst type, as depicted in
table 1.
Table 1: Number of data symbols (N) for burst types 1, 2, 3 and 4
* * *
Spreading factor (SF) Burst Type 1 Burst Type 2 Burst Type 3 Burst Type 4 1
1952 2208 1856 2112 2 976 1104 928 N/A 4 488 552 464 N/A 8 244 276 232 N/A 16
122 138 116 132
* * *
The support of burst types 1, 2 and 3 is mandatory for UEs supporting transmit
and receive functions. UEs supporting transmit and receive functions and also
MBSFN operation must additionally support burst type 4\. UEs with receive only
capability need only support burst type 4. The four different bursts defined
here are well suited for different applications, as described in the following
sections.
#### 5.2.2.1 Burst Type 1
The burst type 1 can be used for uplink and downlink. Due to its longer
midamble field this burst type supports the construction of a larger number of
training sequences, see 5.2.3. The maximum number of training sequences depend
on the cell configuration, see annex A. For the burst type 1 this number may
be 4, 8, or 16.
The data fields of the burst type 1 are 976 chips long. The corresponding
number of symbols depends on the spreading factor, as indicated in table 1
above. The midamble of burst type 1 has a length of 512 chips. The guard
period for the burst type 1 is 96 chip periods long. The burst type 1 is shown
in Figure 4. The contents of the burst fields are described in table 2.

#### 5.2.2.2 Burst Type 2
The burst type 2 can be used for uplink and downlink. It offers a longer data
field than burst type 1 on the cost of a shorter midamble. Due to the shorter
midamble field the burst type 2 supports a maximum number of training
sequences of 3 or 6 only, depending on the cell configuration, see annex A.
The data fields of the burst type 2 are 1104 chips long. The corresponding
number of symbols depends on the spreading factor, as indicated in table 1
above. The guard period for the burst type 2 is 96 chip periods long.The burst
type 2 is shown in Figure 5. The contents of the burst fields are described in
table 3.

#### 5.2.2.3 Burst Type 3
The burst type 3 is used for uplink only. Due to the longer guard period it is
suitable for initial access or access to a new cell after handover. It offers
the same number of training sequences as burst type 1.
The data fields of the burst type 3 have a length of 976 chips and 880 chips,
respectively. The corresponding number of symbols depends on the spreading
factor, as indicated in table 1 above. The midamble of burst type 3 has a
length of 512 chips. The guard period for the burst type 3 is 192 chip periods
long. The burst type 3 is shown in Figure 6. The contents of the burst fields
are described in table 4.

#### 5.2.2.3A Burst Type 4
The burst type 4 is used for downlink MBSFN operation only and supports a
single training sequence.
The data fields of the burst type 4 are 1056 chips long. The corresponding
number of symbols is 132 as indicated in table 1 above. The midamble of burst
type 4 has a length of 320 chips. The guard period for the burst type 4 is 128
chip periods long. The burst type 4 is shown in Figure 6A. The contents of the

#### 5.2.2.4 Transmission of TFCI
All burst types 1, 2, 3 and 4 provide the possibility for transmission of
TFCI.
The transmission of TFCI is negotiated at call setup and can be re-negotiated
during the call. For each CCTrCH it is indicated by higher layer signalling,
which TFCI format is applied, except for the MBSFN FACH where the (16,5) bi-
orthogonal code is always used for TFCI when TFCI is applied. Additionally for
each allocated timeslot it is signalled individually whether that timeslot
carries the TFCI or not. The TFCI is always present in the first timeslot in a
radio frame for each CCTrCH. If a time slot contains the TFCI, then it is
always transmitted using the physical channel with the lowest physical channel
sequence number (_p_) in that timeslot. Physical channel sequence numbering is
determined by the rate matching function and is described in [7].
The transmission of TFCI is done in the data parts of the respective physical
channel. In DL the TFCI code word bits and data bits are subject to the same
spreading procedure as depicted in [8]. In DL, the modulation applied to the
TFCI code word bits is the same as that applied to the data symbols. In UL,
independent of the SF that is applied to the data symbols in the burst, the
data in the TFCI field are always spread with SF=16 using the channelisation
code in the branch with the highest code numbering of the allowed OVSF sub
tree, as depicted in [8]. Hence the midamble structure and length is not
changed. The TFCI code word is to be transmitted directly adjacent to the
midamble, possibly after the TPC. Figure 7 shows the position of the TFCI code
word in a traffic burst in downlink. Figure 8 shows the position of the TFCI
code word in a traffic burst in uplink.
Figure 7: Position of the TFCI code word in the traffic burst in case of
downlink

Two examples of TFCI transmission in the case of multiple DPCHs used for a
connection are given in the Figure 9 and Figure 10 below. Combinations of the
two schemes shown are also applicable.

Figure 10: Example of TFCI transmission with physical channels multiplexed in
time domain
In case the Node B receives an invalid TFI combination on the DCHs mapped to
one CCTrCH the procedure described in [16] shall be applied. According to this
procedure DTX shall be applied to all DPCHs to which the CCTrCH is mapped to.
#### 5.2.2.5 Transmission of TPC
Burst types 1, 2 and 3 for dedicated channels provide the possibility for
transmission of TPC in uplink.
The transmission of TPC is done in the data parts of the traffic burst.
Independent of the SF that is applied to the data symbols in the burst, the
data in the TPC field are always spread with SF=16 using the channelisation
code in the branch with the highest code numbering of the allowed OVSF sub
tree, as depicted in [8]. Hence the midamble structure and length is not
changed. The TPC information is to be transmitted directly after the midamble.
Figure 11 shows the position of the TPC in a traffic burst.
For every user the TPC information shall be transmitted at least once per
transmitted frame. If a TFCI is applied for a CCTrCH, TPC shall be transmitted
with the same channelization codes and in the same timeslots as the TFCI. If
no TFCI is applied for a CCTrCH, TPC shall be transmitted using the physical
channel corresponding to physical channel sequence number _p_ =1. Physical
channel sequence numbering is determined by the rate matching function and is
described in [7].
Figure 11: Position of TPC information in the traffic burst
The length of the TPC field is _N~TPC~_ bits. The TPC field is formed via
repetition encoding a single bit _b~TPC~_ , _N~TPC~_ times.
The relationship between _b~TPC~_ and the TPC command is shown in table 4B.

#### 5.2.2.6 Timeslot formats
##### 5.2.2.6.1 Downlink timeslot formats
The downlink timeslot format depends on the spreading factor, midamble length
and on the number of the TFCI code word bits, as depicted in the table 5a. For
MBSFN operation the timeslot format also depends upon the symbol modulation
scheme used. Slot formats 20-27 are only applicable to MBSFN operation with

##### 5.2.2.6.2 Uplink timeslot formats
The uplink timeslot format depends on the spreading factor, midamble length,
guard period length and on the number of the TFCI code word bits. Due to TPC,
different amount of bits are mapped to the two data fields. The timeslot
formats are depicted in the table 5b. Note that slot format #90 shall only be
used for HS_SICH.

### 5.2.3 Training sequences for spread bursts
In this subclause, the training sequences for usage as midambles in burst type
1, 2,3 and 4 (see subclause 5.2.2) are defined. The training sequences, i.e.
midambles, of different users active in the same cell and same time slot are
cyclically shifted versions of one cell-specific single basic midamble code.
In the case of MBSFN timeslots there is only a single midamble and this is
derived from a single basic midamble code which is not necessarily cell-
specific. The applicable basic midamble codes are given in Annex A.1 and A.2.
As different basic midamble codes are required for different burst formats,
the Annex A.1 shows the basic midamble codes **m** ~PL~ for burst type 1 and
3, and Annex A.2 shows **m** ~PS~ for burst types 2 and 4. It should be noted
that burst type 2 must not be mixed with burst type 1 or 3 in the same
timeslot of one cell and furthermore burst type 4 shall not be mixed with any
other burst type in the same timeslot of one cell.
The basic midamble codes in Annex A.1 and A.2 are listed in hexadecimal
notation. The binary form of the basic midamble code shall be derived
according to table 6 below.
Table 6: Mapping of 4 binary elements {width="0.19375in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}on a single hexadecimal digit
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | 4 binary elements | Mapped on hexadecimal digit | | | | | {width="0.20833333333333334in" | | | height="0.2361111111111111in"} | | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | -1 -1 -1 -1 | 0 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | -1 -1 -1 1 | 1 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | -1 -1 1 --1 | 2 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | -1 -1 1 1 | 3 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | -1 1 -1 --1 | 4 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | -1 1 -1 1 | 5 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | -1 1 1 --1 | 6 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | -1 1 1 1 | 7 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | 1 -1 -1 --1 | 8 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | 1 -1 -1 1 | 9 | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | 1 -1 1 --1 | A | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | 1 -1 1 1 | B | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | 1 1 -1 --1 | C | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | 1 1 -1 1 | D | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | 1 1 1 --1 | E | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+ | 1 1 1 1 | F | +---------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
For each particular basic midamble code, its binary representation can be
written as a vector{width="0.2638888888888889in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}:
{width="1.44375in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} (1)
According to Annex A.1, the size of this vector {width="0.2638888888888889in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} is P=456 for burst types 1 and 3. Annex A.2 is
setting P=192 for burst types 2 and 4. As QPSK modulation is used, the
training sequences are transformed into a complex form, denoted as the complex
vector{width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}:
{width="1.4722222222222223in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} (2)
The elements {width="0.20833333333333334in" height="0.25in"} of
{width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}are derived from
elements {width="0.20833333333333334in" height="0.25in"} of
{width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} using equation
(3):
{width="0.8611111111111112in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} for all
{width="0.6527777777777778in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} (3)
Hence, the elements {width="0.2361111111111111in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"} of the complex basic midamble code are
alternating real and imaginary.
To derive the required training sequences (different shifts), this vector
{width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} is periodically
extended to the size:
{width="2.0in" height="0.25in"} (4)
Notes on equation (4):
\- L~m~: Midamble length
\- K': Maximum number of different midamble shifts in a cell, when no
intermediate shifts are used. This value depends on the midamble length.
\- K: Maximum number of different midamble shifts in a cell, when intermediate
shifts are used, K=2K\'.\ This value depends on the midamble length.
> Note that intermediate shifts are not used for burst type 4, i.e K=K'=1 for
> burst type 4
\- W: Shift between the midambles, when the number of midambles is K'.
\- x denotes the largest integer smaller or equal to x
Allowed values for L~m~, K' and W are given in Annex A.1 and A.2.
So we obtain a new vector {width="0.19375in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}
containing the periodic basic midamble sequence:
{width="3.388888888888889in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} (5)
The first P elements of this vector {width="0.19375in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} are the same ones as in vector
{width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}, the following
elements repeat the beginning:
{width="0.69375in" height="0.25in"} for the subset
{width="1.1388888888888888in" height="0.25in"} (6)
Using this periodic basic midamble sequence {width="0.19375in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} for each shift k a midamble
{width="0.3333333333333333in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} of length L~m~ is
derived, which can be written as a shift specific vector:
{width="1.7361111111111112in" height="0.2916666666666667in"} (7)
The L~m~ midamble elements {width="0.3194444444444444in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"} are generated for each midamble of the first K'
shifts (k = 1,...,K') based on:
{width="1.125in" height="0.2916666666666667in"} with
{width="0.7083333333333334in" height="0.25in"} and {width="0.75in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"} (8)
The elements of midambles for the second K' shifts (k = (K'+1),...,K =
(K'+1),...,2K') are generated based on a slight modification of this formula
introducing intermediate shifts:
{width="1.5555555555555556in" height="0.2916666666666667in"}with
{width="0.7083333333333334in" height="0.25in"} and
{width="1.2083333333333333in" height="0.2222222222222222in"} (9)
{width="1.4722222222222223in" height="0.2916666666666667in"}with
{width="0.7083333333333334in" height="0.25in"} and
{width="0.4583333333333333in" height="0.19375in"} (10)
The number K~Cell~ of midambles that is supported in each cell can be smaller
than K, depending on the cell size and the possible delay spreads, see annex
A. The number K~Cell~ is signalled by higher layers. The midamble sequences
derived according to equations (7) to (10) have complex values and are not
subject to channelisation or scrambling process, i.e. the elements
{width="0.3194444444444444in" height="0.2777777777777778in"} represent complex
chips for usage in the pulse shaping process at modulation.
The term 'a midamble code set' or 'a midamble code family' denotes K specific
midamble codes {width="0.3333333333333333in" height="0.2638888888888889in"};
k=1,...,K, based on a single basic midamble code {width="0.2638888888888889in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} according to (1).
### 5.2.4 Beamforming
When DL beamforming is used, at least that user to which beamforming is
applied and which has a dedicated channel shall get one individual midamble
according to subclause 5.2.3, even in DL. DL beamforming is not applied to
timeslots containing burst type 4.
## 5.3 Common physical channels
### 5.3.1 Primary common control physical channel (P-CCPCH)
The BCH as described in subclause 4.1.2 is mapped onto the Primary Common
Control Physical Channel (P-CCPCH). The position (time slot / code) of the
P-CCPCH is known from the Physical Synchronisation Channel (PSCH), see
subclause 5.3.4.
#### 5.3.1.1 P-CCPCH Spreading
The P-CCPCH uses fixed spreading with a spreading factor SF = 16 as described
in subclause 5.2.1.1. The P-CCPCH always uses channelisation code
{width="0.3611111111111111in" height="0.2777777777777778in"}.
#### 5.3.1.2 P-CCPCH Burst Types
The burst type 1 as described in subclause 5.2.2 is used for the P-CCPCH
unless the entire carrier is dedicated to MBSFN then burst type 4 is used for
P-CCPCH. No TFCI is applied for the P-CCPCH.
#### 5.3.1.3 P-CCPCH Training sequences
The training sequences, i.e. midambles, as described in subclause 5.2.3 are
used for the P-CCPCH.
### 5.3.2 Secondary common control physical channel (S-CCPCH)
PCH and FACH as described in subclause 4.1.2 are mapped onto one or more
secondary common control physical channels (S-CCPCH). In this way the capacity
of PCH and FACH can be adapted to the different requirements.
#### 5.3.2.1 S-CCPCH Spreading
The S-CCPCH uses fixed spreading with a spreading factor SF = 16 as described
in subclause 5.2.1.1. When S-CCPCH is used for MBSFN operation the spreading
factor may be SF = 16 or SF = 1.
#### 5.3.2.2 S-CCPCH Burst Types
The burst types 1,2 or 4 as described in subclause 5.2.2 are used for the
S-CCPCHs. TFCI may be applied for S-CCPCHs.
#### 5.3.2.2A S-CCPCH Modulation
When S-CCPCH is used for MBSFN operation, burst type 4 shall be used and the
modulation may be QPSK or 16QAM, see table 5A for slot formats. When S-CCPCH
is used for all other purposes the modulation shall be QPSK.
#### 5.3.2.3 S-CCPCH Training sequences
The training sequences, i.e. midambles, as described in subclause 5.2.3 are
used for the S-CCPCH.
### 5.3.3 The physical random access channel (PRACH)
The RACH as described in subclause 4.1.2 is mapped onto one uplink physical
random access channel (PRACH).
#### 5.3.3.1 PRACH Spreading
The uplink PRACH uses either spreading factor SF=16 or SF=8 as described in
subclause 5.2.1.2. The set of admissible spreading codes for use on the PRACH
and the associated spreading factors are broadcast on the BCH (within the RACH
configuration parameters on the BCH).
#### 5.3.3.2 PRACH Burst Type
The UEs send uplink access bursts of type 3 randomly in the PRACH. TFCI and
TPC are not applied for the PRACH.
#### 5.3.3.3 PRACH Training sequences
The training sequences, i.e. midambles, of different users active in the same
time slot are time shifted versions of a single periodic basic code. The basic
midamble codes for burst type 3 are shown in Annex A. The necessary time
shifts are obtained by choosing either _all_ k=1,2,3...,K' (for cells with
small radius) or _uneven_ k=1,3,5,...≤K' (for cells with large radius).
Different cells use different periodic basic codes, i.e. different midamble
sets.
For cells with large radius additional midambles may be derived from the time-
inverted Basic Midamble Sequence. Thus, the second Basic Midamble Code m~2~ is
the time inverted version of Basic Midamble Code m~1~.
In this way, a joint channel estimation for the channel impulse responses of
all active users within one time slot can be performed by a maximum of two
cyclic correlations (in cells with small radius, a single cyclic correlator
suffices). The different user specific channel impulse response estimates are
obtained sequentially in time at the output of the cyclic correlators.
#### 5.3.3.4 PRACH timeslot formats
For the PRACH the timeslot format is only spreading factor dependent. The
timeslot formats 60 and 66 of table 5b are applicable for the PRACH.
#### 5.3.3.5 Association between Training Sequences and Channelisation Codes
For the PRACH there exists a fixed association between the training sequence
and the channelisation code. The generic rule to define this association is
based on the order of the channelisation codes **c** ~Q~^(_k_)^ given by _k_
and the order of the midambles **m** _~j~_ ^(_k_)^ given by _k_ , firstly, and
_j_ , secondly, with the constraint that the midamble for a spreading factor
_Q_ is the same as in the upper branch for the spreading factor 2 _Q_. The
index _j=1 or 2_ indicates whether the original Basic Midamble Sequence (j=1)
or the time-inverted Basic Midamble Sequence is used (j=2).
\- For the case that all _k_ are allowed and only one periodic basic code m~1~
is available for the RACH, the association depicted in figure 12 is
straightforward.
\- For the case that only odd _k_ are allowed the principle of the association
is shown in figure 13. This association is applied for one and two basic
periodic codes.

### 5.3.4 The synchronisation channel (SCH)
In TDD mode code group of a cell can be derived from the synchronisation
channel. In order not to limit the uplink/downlink asymmetry the SCH is mapped
on one or two downlink slots per frame only.
There are two cases of SCH and P-CCPCH allocation as follows:
Case 1) SCH and P-CCPCH allocated in TS#k, k=0....14
Case 2) SCH allocated in two TS: TS#k and TS#k+8, k=0...6; P-CCPCH allocated
in TS#k.
Only case 1 is supported in the case that the entire carrier is dedicated to
MBSFN.
The position of SCH (value of k) in frame can change on a long term basis in
any case.
Due to this SCH scheme, the position of P-CCPCH is known from the SCH.
Figure 14 is an example for transmission of SCH, k=0, of Case 2.
{width="6.010416666666667in" height="4.489583333333333in"}
Figure 14: Scheme for Synchronisation channel SCH consisting of one primary
sequence C~p~ and 3 parallel secondary sequences C~s,i~ in slot k and k+8
(example for k=0 in Case 2)
As depicted in figure 14, the SCH consists of a primary and three secondary
code sequences each 256 chips long. The primary and secondary code sequences
are defined in [8] clause 7 \'Synchronisation codes for the 3.84 Mcps
option\'.
Due to mobile to mobile interference, it is mandatory for public TDD systems
to keep synchronisation between base stations. As a consequence of this, a
capture effect concerning SCH can arise. The time offset t~offset,n~ enables
the system to overcome the capture effect.
The time offset t~offset,n~ is one of 32 values, depending on the code group
of the cell, n, cf. 'table 6 Mapping scheme for Cell Parameters, Code Groups,
Scrambling Codes, Midambles and t~offset~' in [8]. Note that the cell
parameter will change from frame to frame, cf. 'Table 7 Alignment of cell
parameter cycling and system frame number' in [8], but the cell will belong to
only one code group and thus have one time offset t~offset,n~. The exact value
for t~offset,n~, regarding column 'Associated t~offset~' in table 6 in [8] is
given by:
{width="3.2777777777777777in" height="0.5277777777777778in"}
### 5.3.5 Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)
The USCH as desribed in subclause 4.1.2 is mapped onto one or more physical
uplink shared channels (PUSCH). Timing advance, as described in [9], subclause
4.3, is applied to the PUSCH.
#### 5.3.5.1 PUSCH Spreading
The spreading factors that can be applied to the PUSCH are SF = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
as described in subclause 5.2.1.2.
#### 5.3.5.2 PUSCH Burst Types
Burst types 1, 2 or 3 as described in subclause 5.2.2 can be used for PUSCH.
TFCI and TPC can be transmitted on the PUSCH.
#### 5.3.5.3 PUSCH Training Sequences
The training sequences as desribed in subclause 5.2.3 are used for the PUSCH.
#### 5.3.5.4 UE Selection
The UE that shall transmit on the PUSCH is selected by higher layer
signalling.
### 5.3.6 Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH)
The DSCH as described in subclause 4.1.2 is mapped onto one or more physical
downlink shared channels (PDSCH).
#### 5.3.6.1 PDSCH Spreading
The PDSCH uses either spreading factor SF = 16 or SF = 1 as described in
subclause 5.2.1.1.
#### 5.3.6.2 PDSCH Burst Types
Burst types 1 or 2 as described in subclause 5.2.2 can be used for PDSCH. TFCI
can be transmitted on the PDSCH.
#### 5.3.6.3 PDSCH Training Sequences
The training sequences as described in subclause 5.2.3 are used for the PDSCH.
#### 5.3.6.4 UE Selection
To indicate to the UE that there is data to decode on the DSCH, three
signalling methods are available:
1) using the TFCI field of the associated channel or PDSCH;
2) using on the DSCH user specific midamble derived from the set of midambles
used for that cell;
3) using higher layer signalling.
When the midamble based method is used, the UE specific midamble allocation
method shall be employed (see subclause 5.6), and the UE shall decode the
PDSCH if the PDSCH was transmitted with the midamble assigned to the UE by
UTRAN. For this method no other physical channels may use the same time slot
as the PDSCH and only one UE may share the PDSCH time slot within one TTI.
Note: From the above mentioned signalling methods, only the higher layer
signalling method is supported by higher layers in this release.
### 5.3.7 The Paging Indicator Channel (PICH)
The Paging Indicator Channel (PICH) is a physical channel used to carry the
paging indicators.
#### 5.3.7.1 Mapping of Paging Indicators to the PICH bits
Figure 15 depicts the structure of a PICH burst and the numbering of the bits
within the burst. The same burst type is used for the PICH in every cell.
N~PIB~ bits in a normal burst of type 1 or 2 are used to carry the paging
indicators, where N~PIB~ depends on the burst type: N~PIB~=240 for burst type
1 and N~PIB~=272 for burst type 2. The bits _s_ ~NPIB+1~,..., _s_ ~NPIB+4~
adjacent to the midamble are reserved for possible future use.
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="1.542361111111111in"}
Figure 15: Transmission and numbering of paging indicator carrying bits in a
PICH burst
Each paging indicator P~q~ in one time slot is mapped to the bits
{s~2Lpi*q+1~,...,s~2Lpi*(q+1)~} within this time slot. Thus, due to the
interleaved transmission of the bits half of the symbols used for each paging
indicator are transmitted in the first data part, and the other half of the
symbols are transmitted in the second data part, as exemplary shown in figure
16 for a paging indicator length L~PI~ of 4 symbols.
{width="3.09375in" height="1.6666666666666667in"} {width="3.09375in"
height="1.6666666666666667in"}
Figure 16: Example of mapping of paging indicators on PICH bits for L~PI~=4
The setting of the paging indicators and the corresponding PICH bits
(including the reserved ones) is described in [7].
N~PI~ paging indicators of length L~PI~=2, L~PI~=4 or L~PI~=8 symbols are
transmitted in each radio frame that contains the PICH. The number of paging
indicators N~PI~ per radio frame is given by the paging indicator length and
the burst type, which are both known by higher layer signalling. In table 7
this number is shown for the different possibilities of burst types and paging
indicator lengths.
Table 7: Number N~PI~ of paging indicators per time slot for the different
burst types and paging indicator lengths L~PI~
* * *
                 L~PI~=2    L~PI~=4    L~PI~=8
Burst Type 1 N~PI~=60 N~PI~=30 N~PI~=15 Burst Type 2 N~PI~=68 N~PI~=34
N~PI~=17
* * *
#### 5.3.7.2 Structure of the PICH over multiple radio frames
As shown in figure 17, the paging indicators of N~PICH~ consecutive frames
form a PICH block, N~PICH~ is configured by higher layers. Thus,
N~P~=N~PICH~*N~PI~ paging indicators are transmitted in each PICH block.
{width="4.978472222222222in" height="1.5090277777777779in"}
Figure 17: Structure of a PICH block
The value PI (PI = 0, ..., N~P~-1) calculated by higher layers for use for a
certain UE, see [15], is associated to the paging indicator P~q~ in the nth
frame of one PICH block, where q is given by
q = PI mod N~PI~
and n is given by
n = PI div N~PI~.
The PI bitmap in the PCH data frames over Iub contains indication values for
all possible higher layer PI values, see [17]. Each bit in the bitmap
indicates if the paging indicator P~q~ associated with that particular PI
shall be set to 0 or 1. Hence, the calculation in the formulas above is to be
performed in Node B to make the association between PI and P~q~.
#### 5.3.7.3 PICH Training sequences
The training sequences, i.e. midambles for the PICH.are generated as described
in subclause 5.2.3. The allocation of midambles depends on whether SCTD is
applied to the PICH.
\- If no antenna diversity is applied the PICH the midambles can be allocated
as described in subclause 5.6.
\- If SCTD antenna diversity is applied to the PICH the allocation of
midambles shall be as described in [9].
### 5.3.8 The physical node B synchronisation channel (PNBSCH)
In case cell sync bursts are used for Node B synchronisation the PNBSCH shall
be used for the transmission of the cell sync burst [8]. The PNBSCH shall be
mapped on the same timeslot as the PRACH acc. to a higher layer schedule. The
cell sync burst shall be transmitted at the beginning of a timeslot. In case
of Node B synchronisation via the air interface the transmission of a RACH may
be prohibited on higher layer command in specified frames and timeslots.
### 5.3.9 High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-PDSCH)
The HS-DSCH as desribed in subclause 4.1.2 is mapped onto one or more high
speed physical downlink shared channels (HS-PDSCH).
#### 5.3.9.1 HS-PDSCH Spreading
The HS-PDSCH shall use either spreading factor SF = 16 or SF=1, as described
in 5.2.1.1.
#### 5.3.9.2 HS-PDSCH Burst Types
Burst types 1 or 2 as described in subclause 5.2.2 can be used for PDSCH. TFCI
shall not be transmitted on the HS-PDSCH. The TF of the HS-DSCH is derived
from the associated HS-SCCH.
#### 5.3.9.3 HS-PDSCH Training Sequences
The training sequences as described in subclause 5.2.3 are used for the HS-
PDSCH.
#### 5.3.9.4 UE Selection
To indicate to the UE that there is data to decode on the HS-DSCH, the UE id
on the associated HS-SCCH shall be used.
#### 5.3.9.5 HS-PDSCH timeslot formats
An HS-PDSCH may use QPSK or 16QAM modulation symbols. The time slot formats
are shown in table 7A.
Table 7A: Time slot formats for the HS-PDSCH
+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | Slot | Sp | M | N~TFC | Bi | N~Dat | N~dat | | Format | reading | idamble | I\ code | ts/slot | a/Slot~ | a/data\ | | | Factor | length | \ word~ | | (bits) | field~ | | # | | (chips) | (bits) | | | (bits) | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | 0 | 16 | 512 | 0 | 244 | 244 | 122 | | (QPSK) | | | | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | 1 | 16 | 512 | 0 | 488 | 488 | 244 | | (16QAM) | | | | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | 2 | 16 | 256 | 0 | 276 | 276 | 138 | | (QPSK) | | | | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | 3 | 16 | 256 | 0 | 552 | 552 | 276 | | (16QAM) | | | | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | 4 | 1 | 512 | 0 | 3904 | 3904 | 1952 | | (QPSK) | | | | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | 5 | 1 | 512 | 0 | 7808 | 7808 | 3904 | | (16QAM) | | | | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | 6 | 1 | 256 | 0 | 4416 | 4416 | 2208 | | (QPSK) | | | | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | 7 | 1 | 256 | 0 | 8832 | 8832 | 4416 | | (16QAM) | | | | | | | +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
### 5.3.10 Shared Control Channel for HS-DSCH (HS-SCCH)
The HS-SCCH is a DL physical channel that carries higher layer control
information for HS-DSCH. The physical layer will process this information
according to [7] and will transmit the resulting bits on the HS-SCCH the
structure of which is described below.
#### 5.3.10.1 HS-SCCH Spreading
The HS-SCCH shall use spreading factor SF = 16, as described in 5.2.1.1.
#### 5.3.10.2 HS-SCCH Burst Types
Burst type 1 as described in subclause 5.2.2 can be used for HS-SCCH. TFCI
shall not be transmitted on the HS-SCCH.
#### 5.3.10.3 HS-SCCH Training Sequences
The training sequences as described in subclause 5.2.3 are used for the HS-
SCCH.
#### 5.3.10.4 HS-SCCH timeslot formats
The HS-SCCH always uses time slot format #0 from table 5a, see section
5.2.2.6.1.
### 5.3.11 Shared Information Channel for HS-DSCH (HS-SICH)
The HS-SICH is a UL physical channel that carries higher layer control
information and the Channel Quality Indicator CQI for HS-DSCH. The physical
layer will process this information according to [7] and will transmit the
resulting bits on the HS-SICH the structure of which is described below.
#### 5.3.11.1 HS-SICH Spreading
The HS-SICH shall use spreading factor SF = 16, as described in 5.2.1.2.
#### 5.3.11.2 HS-SICH Burst Types
Burst type 1 as described in subclause 5.2.2 can be used for HS-SICH. TFCI
shall not be transmitted on the HS-SICH, however, the HS-SICH shall carry TPC
information.
#### 5.3.11.3 HS-SICH Training Sequences
The training sequences as described in subclause 5.2.3 are used for the HS-
SICH.
#### 5.3.11.4 HS-SICH timeslot formats
The HS-SICH shall use time slot format #90 from table 5b, see section
5.2.2.6.2.
### 5.3.12 The MBMS Indicator Channel (MICH)
The MBMS Indicator Channel (MICH) is a physical channel used to carry the MBMS
notification indicators. The UE may use multiple MICH within the MBMS
modification period in order to make decisions on individual MBMS notification
indicators.
#### 5.3.12.1 Mapping of MBMS Indicators to the MICH bits for burst types 1
and 2
Figure 17a depicts the structure of a MICH burst and the numbering of the bits
within the burst. The same burst type is used for the MICH in every cell.
N~NIB~ bits in a normal burst of type 1 or 2 are used to carry the MBMS
notification indicators, where N~NIB~ depends on the burst type: N~NIB~=240
for burst type 1 and N~NIB~=272 for burst type 2. The bits _s_ ~NNIB+1~,...,
_s_ ~NNIB+4~ adjacent to the midamble are reserved for possible future use.
Figure 17a: Transmission and numbering of MBMS notification indicator carrying
bits in a MICH burst using burst types 1 and 2
Each notification indicator N~q~ in one time slot is mapped to the bits
{s~2LNI*q+1~,...,s~2LNI*(q+1)~} within this time slot. Thus, due to the
interleaved transmission of the bits half of the symbols used for each MBMS
notification indicator are transmitted in the first data part, and the other
half of the symbols are transmitted in the second data part: an example is
shown in figure 17b for a MBMS notification indicator length L~NI~ of 4
symbols.
Figure 17b: Example of mapping of MBMS notification indicators on MICH bits
for L~NI~=4 for burst types 2 and 1 respectively
The setting of the MBMS notification indicators and the corresponding MICH
bits (including the reserved ones) is described in [7].
N~n~ MBMS notification indicators of length L~NI~=2, L~NI~=4 or L~NI~=8
symbols are transmitted in each MICH. The number of MBMS notification
indicators N~n~ per MICH is given by the MBMS notification indicator length
and the burst type, which are both known by higher layer signalling. In table
7B this number is shown for burst types 1 and 2 and differing MBMS
notification indicator lengths.
Table 7B: Number N~n~ of MBMS notification indicators per time slot for the
different burst types 1 and 2 and differing MBMS notification indicator
lengths L~NI~
* * *
                 L~NI~=2   L~NI~=4   L~NI~=8
Burst Type 1 N~n~=60 N~n~=30 N~n~=15 Burst Type 2 N~n~=68 N~n~=34 N~n~=17
* * *
The value NI (NI = 0, ..., N~NI~-1) calculated by higher layers, is associated
to the MBMS notification indicator N~q~, where q = NI mod N~n~.
The set of NI passed over the Iub indicates all higher layer NI values for
which the notification indicator on MICH should be set to 1 during the
corresponding modification period; all other indicators shall be set to 0.
#### 5.3.12.1A Mapping of MBMS Indicators to the MICH bits for burst type 4
When an entire carrier is dedicated to MBSFN operation, the MICH shall use
burst type 4. In this case N~NIB~=256 and there are 8 reserved/unused bits
adjacent to the midamble reserved for possible future use. The transmission
and numbering of MBMS notification indicator carrying bits in a MICH burst is
similar to that of figure 17a with the exception of 4 reserved bits either
side of the midamble as opposed to 2 for burst types 1 and 2. An example
mapping is shown in figure 17ba for a MBMS notification indicator length L~NI~
of 4 symbols.
Figure 17ba: Example of mapping of MBMS notification indicators on MICH bits
for L~NI~=4 for burst type 4
The setting of the MBMS notification indicators and the corresponding MICH
bits (including the reserved ones) is described in [7].
N~n~ MBMS notification indicators of length L~NI~=2, L~NI~=4 or L~NI~=8
symbols are transmitted in each MICH. The number of MBMS notification
indicators N~n~ per MICH is given by the MBMS notification indicator length
and the burst type, which are both known by higher layer signalling. In table
7BA this number is shown for the different possibilities of burst types and
MBMS notification indicator lengths.

                 L~NI~=2   L~NI~=4   L~NI~=8
Burst Type 4 N~n~=64 N~n~=32 N~n~=16
* * *
The value NI (NI = 0, ..., N~NI~-1) calculated by higher layers, is associated
to the MBMS notification indicator N~q~, where q = NI mod N~n~.
The set of NI passed over the Iub indicates all higher layer NI values for
which the notification indicator on MICH should be set to 1 during the
corresponding modification period; all other indicators shall be set to 0.
#### 5.3.12.2 MICH Training sequences
The training sequences, i.e. midambles for the MICH, are generated as
described in subclause 5.2.3. The allocation of midambles depends on whether
SCTD is applied to the MICH.
\- If no antenna diversity is applied the MICH the midambles can be allocated
as described in subclause 5.6.
\- If SCTD antenna diversity is applied to the MICH the allocation of
midambles shall be as described in [9].
Note that when the entire carrier is dedicated to MBSFN operation MICH employs
burst type 4 as described in subclause 5.3.12.1A. Burst type 4 supports a
single midamble and hence SCTD is precluded from operation in such a scenario.
### 5.3.13 E-DCH Physical Uplink Channel (E-PUCH)
One or more E-PUCH are used to carry the uplink E-DCH transport channel and
associated control information (E-UCCH) in each E-DCH TTI. In a timeslot
designated by UTRAN for E-PUCH use, up to one E-PUCH may be transmitted by a
UE. No other physical channels may be transmitted by a UE in an E-PUCH
timeslot.
Timing advance, as described in [9], subclause 4.3, is applied to the E-PUCH.
#### 5.3.13.1 E-UCCH
The E-DCH Uplink Control Channel (E-UCCH) carries uplink control information
associated with the E-DCH and is carried within indicator fields mapped to
E-PUCH. Depending on the configuration by higher layers, an E-PUCH burst may
or may not contain E-UCCH and TPC. When E-PUCH does contain E-UCCH, TPC is
also transmitted. When E-PUCH does not contain E-UCCH, TPC is not transmitted.
Higher layers shall indicate the maximum number of timeslots (_N~E-UCCH~_)
that may contain E-UCCH/TPC in the E-DCH TTI. For an allocation of _n~TS~_
E-PUCH timeslots, the UE shall transmit E-UCCH and TPC on the first _m_
allocated timeslots of the E-DCH TTI, where _m_ = min(_n~TS~_ , _N~E-UCCH~_).
The E-UCCH comprises two parts, E-UCCH part 1 and E-UCCH part 2.
E-UCCH part 1:
  * is of length 32 physical channel bits
  * is mapped to the TFCI field of the E-PUCH (16 bits either side of the midamble)
  * is spread at SF=16 using the channelisation code in the branch with the highest code numbering of the allowed OVSF sub tree, as depicted in [8]
  * uses QPSK modulation
E-UCCH part 2:
  * is of length 32 physical channel bits
  * is spread using the same spreading factor as the data payloads
  * uses the same modulation as the data payloads
Figures 17c and 17d show the E-PUCH data burst with and without the E-UCCH/TPC
fields.
Figure 17c: Location of E-UCCH part 1, E-UCCH part 2 and TPC in the E-PUCH
data burst
Figure 17d: E-PUCH data burst without E-UCCH/TPC
#### 5.3.13.2 E-PUCH Spreading
The spreading factors that can be applied to the E-PUCH are SF = 1, 2, 4, 8,
16 as described in subclause 5.2.1.2.
#### 5.3.13.3 E-PUCH Burst Types
Burst types 1, 2 or 3 as described in subclause 5.2.2 can be used for E-PUCH.
E-UCCH and TPC can be transmitted on the E-PUCH.
#### 5.3.13.4 PUSCH Training Sequences
The training sequences as desribed in subclause 5.2.3 are used for the E-PUCH.
#### 5.3.13.5 UE Selection
UEs that shall transmit on the E-PUCH are selected by higher layers. The UE id
on the associated E-AGCH shall be used for identification.
#### 5.3.13.6 E-PUCH timeslot formats
An E-PUCH may use QPSK or 16QAM modulation symbols and may or may not contain
E-UCCH/TPC. The time slot formats are shown in table 7c.

### 5.3.14 E-DCH Random Access Uplink Control Channel (E-RUCCH)
The E-RUCCH is used to carry E-DCH-associated uplink control signalling when
E-PUCH resources are not available. The characteristics of the E-RUCCH
physical channel are identical to those of PRACH (see subclause 5.3.3).
Physical resources available for E-RUCCH are configured by higher layers.
E-RUCCH may be mapped to the same physical resources that are assigned for
PRACH.
### 5.3.15 E-DCH Absolute Grant Channel (E-AGCH)
The E-DCH Absolute Grant Channel (E-AGCH) is a downlink physical channel
carrying the uplink E-DCH absolute grant control information. E-AGCH carries a
TPC field (located immediately after the midamble and spread using SF16) which
is used to control the E-PUCH power. Figure 17e illustrates the burst
structure of the E‑AGCH.
Figure 17e: Burst structure of E-AGCH
One E-DCH absolute grant for a UE shall be transmitted over one E-AGCH.
#### 5.3.15.1 E-AGCH Spreading
The E-AGCH shall use spreading factor SF = 16, as described in 5.2.1.1.
#### 5.3.15.2 E-AGCH Burst Types
Burst types 1 and 2 as described in subclause 5.2.2 can be used for E-AGCH.
TPC shall be transmitted on E-AGCH whereas TFCI shall not be transmitted.
#### 5.3.15.3 E-AGCH Training Sequences
The training sequences as described in subclause 5.2.3 are used for the
E-AGCH.
#### 5.3.15.4 E-AGCH timeslot formats
The E-AGCH uses the timeslot formats of Table 7d. These augment downlink slot
formats 0...19 of table 5a, see subclause 5.2.2.6.1.

### 5.3.16 E-DCH Hybrid ARQ Acknowledgement Indicator Channel (E-HICH)
The E-DCH HARQ Acknowledgement indicator channel (E-HICH) is defined in terms
of a SF16 downlink physical channel and a signature sequence. The E-HICH
carries the uplink E-DCH hybrid ARQ acknowledgement indicator. Figure 17f
illustrates the structure of the E-HICH.
Figure 17f -- E-HICH Structure
A single channelisation code may carry one or multiple signature sequences.
Each signature sequence conveys a HARQ acknowledgement indicator. A maximum of
one indicator may be transmitted to a UE. Each acknowledgement indicator is
coded to form a signature sequence of 240 bits (b~0~, b~1~, ... , b~239~) as
defined in [7] and is transmitted within a single E-HICH timeslot. The E-HICH
also contains _U_ spare bit locations, where _U=4_ for burst type 1 and _U=36_
for burst type 2. The spare bit values are not defined.
#### 5.3.16.1 E-HICH Spreading
Signature sequences (including spare bits inserted) that share the same
channelisation code are combined and spread using spreading factor SF=16 as
described in [8].
#### 5.3.16.2 E-HICH Burst Types
Burst types 1 and 2 as described in subclause 5.2.2 can be used for E-HICH.
Neither TFCI nor TPC shall be transmitted on the E-HICH.
#### 5.3.16.3 E-HICH Training Sequences
The training sequences as described in subclause 5.2.3 are used for the
E-HICH.
## 5.4 Transmit Diversity for DL Physical Channels
Table 8 summarizes the different transmit diversity schemes for different
downlink physical channel types that are described in [9].

(*) Note: SCTD may only be applied to physical channels when they are
allocated to beacon locations.
(**) Note: TSTD may not be applied to S-CCPCH in beacon locations.
(†) Note: that when the entire carrier is dedicated to MBSFN operation SCTD
shall not be applied.
## 5.5 Beacon characteristics of physical channels
For the purpose of measurements, common physical channels that are allocated
to particular locations (time slot, code) shall have particular physical
characteristics, called beacon characteristics. Physical channels with beacon
characteristics are called beacon channels. The locations of the beacon
channels are called beacon locations. The ensemble of beacon channels shall
provide the beacon function, i.e. a reference power level at the beacon
locations, regularly existing in each radio frame. Thus, beacon channels must
be present in each radio frame, the only exception is when idle periods are
used to support time difference measurements for location services [9]. Then
it may be possible that the beacon channels occur in the same frame and time
slot as the idle periods. In this case, the beacon channels will not be
transmitted in that particular frame and time slot.
### 5.5.1 Location of beacon channels
The beacon locations are determined by the SCH and depend on the SCH
allocation case, see subclause 5.3.4:
> Case 1) The beacon function shall be provided by the physical channels that
> are allocated to channelisation code {width="0.3611111111111111in"
> height="0.2777777777777778in"} and to TS#k, k=0,...,14.
>
> Case 2) The beacon function shall be provided by the physical channels that
> are allocated to channelisation code {width="0.3611111111111111in"
> height="0.2777777777777778in"} and to TS#k and TS#k+8, k=0,...,6.
Note that by this definition the P-CCPCH always has beacon characteristics.
### 5.5.2 Physical characteristics of beacon channels
The beacon channels shall have the following physical characteristics. They:
\- are transmitted with reference power;
\- are transmitted without beamforming;
\- use burst type 1 or burst type 4 when MBSFN is applied to beacon channels;
\- use midamble m^(1)^ and m^(2)^ exclusively in this time slot; and
\- midambles m^(9)^ and m^(10)^ are always left unused in this time slot, if
16 midambles are allowed in that cell.
Note that in the time slot where the P-CCPCH is transmitted only the midambles
m^(1)^ to m^(8)^ shall be used, see 5.6.1. Thus, midambles m^(9)^ and m^(10)^
are always left unused in this time slot.
Note that when MBSFN is applied to beacon channels there is a single midamble
and hence midamble m^(1)^ is exclusively used in the timeslot.
The reference power corresponds to the sum of the power allocated to both
midambles m^(1)^ and m^(2)^. Two possibilities exist:
\- If SCTD antenna diversity is not applied to beacon channels all the
reference power of any beacon channel is allocated to m^(1)^.
\- If SCTD antenna diversity is applied to beacon channels, for any beacon
channel midambles m^(1)^ and m^(2)^ are each allocated half of the reference
power.
## 5.6 Midamble Allocation for Physical Channels
Midambles are part of the physical channel configuration which is performed by
higher layers. Three different midamble allocation schemes exist:
\- UE specific midamble allocation: A UE specific midamble for DL or UL is
explicitly assigned by higher layers.
\- Default midamble allocation: The midamble for DL or UL is allocated by
layer 1 depending on the associated channelisation code.
\- Common midamble allocation: The midamble for the DL is allocated by layer 1
depending on the number of channelisation codes currently being present in the
DL time slot.
If a midamble is not explicitly assigned and the use of the common midamble
allocation scheme is not signalled by higher layers, the midamble shall be
allocated by layer 1, based on the default midamble allocation scheme. This
default midamble allocation scheme is given by a fixed association between
midambles and channelisation codes, see clause A.3, and shall be applied
individually to all channelisation codes within one time slot. Different
associations apply for different burst types and cell configurations with
respect to the maximum number of midambles.
For timeslots employing MBSFN operation burst type 4 is used and hence DL
beamforming is not applied, subclause 5.2.4. Furthermore, as this burst type
contains only a single midamble, i.e. K~Cell~=1, then all physical channels in
such timeslots employ the same midamble and thus default and common midamble
allocation amount to the same allocation strategies.
### 5.6.1 Midamble Allocation for DL Physical Channels
Beacon channels shall always use the reserved midambles m^(1)^ and m^(2)^, see
5.5. For DL physical channels that are located in the same time slot as the
P-CCPCH, midambles shall be allocated based on the default midamble allocation
scheme, using the association for burst type 1 and K~Cell~ =8 midambles. For
all other DL physical channels, the midamble is explicitly assigned by higher
layers or allocated by layer 1.
#### 5.6.1.1 Midamble Allocation by signalling from higher layers
UE specific midambles may be signalled by higher layers to UE\'s as a part of
the physical channel configuration, if:
\- multiple UEs use the physical channels in one DL time slot; and
\- beamforming is applied to all of these DL physical channels; and
\- no closed loop TxDiversity is applied to any of these DL physical channels;
or
\- PDSCH physical layer signalling based on the midamble is used.
#### 5.6.1.2 Midamble Allocation by layer 1
##### 5.6.1.2.1 Default midamble
If a midamble is not explicitly assigned and the use of the common midamble
allocation scheme is not signalled by higher layers, the UE shall derive the
midambles from the allocated channelisation codes and shall use an individual
midamble for each channelisation code group containing one primary and a set
of secondary channelisation codes. The association between midambles and
channelisation code groups is given in annex A.3. All the secondary
channelisation codes within a set use the same midamble as the primary
channelisation code to which they are associated.
Higher layers shall allocate the channelisation codes in a particular order.
Secondary codes shall only be allocated if the associated primary code is also
allocated. If midambles are reserved for the beacon channels, all primary and
secondary channelisation codes that are associated with the reserved midambles
shall not be used.
Channelisation codes of one channelisation code group shall not be allocated
to different UE's.
In the case that secondary channelisation codes are used, secondary
channelisation codes of one channelisation code group shall be allocated in
ascending order, with respect to their numbering, and beginning with the
lowest code index in this channelisation code group.
The UE shall assume different channel estimates for each of the individual
midambles.
The default midamble allocation shall not apply for those downlink channels
that are intended for a UE which will be the only UE assigned to a given time
slot or slots for the duration of the assigned channel\'s existence (as in the
case of high rate services).
##### 5.6.1.2.2 Common Midamble
The use of the common midamble allocation scheme is signalled to the UE by
higher layers as a part of the physical channel configuration. A common
midamble may be assigned by layer 1 to all physical channels in one DL time
slot, if:
\- a single UE uses all physical channels in one DL time slot (as in the case
of high rate service);
or
\- multiple UEs use the physical channels in one DL time slot; and
\- no beamforming is applied to any of these DL physical channels; and
\- no closed loop TxDiversity is applied to any of these DL physical channels;
and
\- midambles are not used for PDSCH physical layer signalling.
The number of channelisation codes currently employed in the DL time slot is
associated with the use of a particular common midamble. Different
associations apply for different burst types and cell configurations with
respect to the maximum number of midambles, see annex B.
### 5.6.2 Midamble Allocation for UL Physical Channels
If the midamble is explicitly assigned by higher layers, an individual
midamble shall be assigned to all UE's in one UL time slot.
If no midamble is explicitly assigned by higher layers, the UE shall derive
the midamble from the channelisation code that is used for the data part
(except for TFCI/TPC) of the burst. Note that in the event that code hopping
is employed the midamble is derived from the channelisation code actually
transmitted (i.e. the code used after the hop sequence has been applied -- see
[9]). The associations between midamble and channelisation code are the same
as for DL physical channels.
## 5.7 Midamble Transmit Power
There shall be no offset between the sum of the powers allocated to all
midambles in a timeslot and the sum of the powers allocated to the data symbol
fields. The transmit power within a timeslot is hence constant.
The midamble transmit power of beacon channels is equal to the reference
power. If SCTD is used for beacon channels, the reference power is equally
divided between the midambles m^(1)^ and m^(2)^.
The midamble transmit power of all other physical channels depends on the
midamble allocation scheme used. The following rules apply
\- In case of Default Midamble Allocation, every midamble is transmitted with
the same power as the associated codes.
\- In case of Common Midamble Allocation in the downlink, the transmit power
of this common midamble is such that there is no power offset between the data
parts and the midamble part of the overall transmit signal within one time
slot.
\- In case of UE Specific Midamble Allocation, the transmit power of the UE
specific midamble is such that there is no power offset between the data parts
and the midamble part of every user within one time slot.
The following figure 18 depicts the midamble powers for the different channel
types and midamble allocation schemes.
Note 1: In figure 18, the codes c(1) to c(16) represent the set of usable
codes and not the set of used codes.
Note 2: The common midamble allocation and the midamble allocation by higher
layers are not applicable in those beacon time slots, in which the P-CCPCH is

## 5.8 Physical channels for the 3.84 Mcps MBSFN IMB option
Physical channels are defined by a specific carrier frequency, scrambling
code, channelization code and in some cases a time start & stop (giving a
duration). Scrambling and channelization codes are specified in [8]. Time
durations are defined by start and stop instants, measured in integer
multiples of chips. Suitable multiples of chips also used in specification
are:
> Radio frame: A radio frame is a processing duration which consists of 15
> slots. The length of a radio frame corresponds to 38400 chips (10 ms).
>
> Slot: A slot is a duration which consists of fields containing bits. The
> length of a slot corresponds to 2560 chips.
>
> Sub-frame: A sub-frame corresponds to 3 slots (2 ms).
The default time duration for a physical channel is continuous from the
instant when it is started to the instant when it is stopped. Physical
channels that are not continuous will be explicitly described. In the case of
2 ms physical channel duration, the physical channel is active for only one 2
ms sub-frame (7680 chips) per radio frame. A physical channel of 2 ms duration
may start at one of 5 start instances per radio frame. These correspond to 0
ms, 2 ms, 4 ms, 6 ms or 8 ms following the commencement of the radio frame and
are denoted as sub-frames 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
Transport channels are described (in more abstract higher layer models of the
physical layer) as being capable of being mapped to physical channels. Within
the physical layer itself the exact mapping is from a composite coded
transport channel (CCTrCH) to the data part of a physical channel. In addition
to data parts there are also channel control parts and physical signals. For
the IMB option, both a continuous and a discontinuous pilot physical channel
shall be transmitted using specific OVSF channelisation codes.
The IMB option is only applicable for dedicated carrier MBSFN operations in
which all TDD slots of the radio frame are configured in the downlink
direction. All physical channels are common and downlink only.
Figure 18iA: Downlink transmissions in all TDD slots
### 5.8.1 Transmit diversity
Transmit diversity is not applicable to IMB physical channels for MBSFN
operations.
### 5.8.2 Common physical channels
The common physical channels used on a dedicated carrier for the IMB option
are P-CPICH, T-CPICH, P-CCPCH, S-CCPCH frame type 1, S-CCPCH frame type 2, SCH
and MICH.
#### 5.8.2.1 Primary Common Pilot Channel (P-CPICH)
The primary common pilot channel (P-CPICH) is a fixed rate (30 kbps, SF=256)
downlink physical channel using QPSK modulation and carrying a pre-defined bit
sequence in which all bits are set to logical "0". The P-CPICH is transmitted
continuously on all slots of the radio frame. Figure 18iiA shows the frame
structure of the P-CPICH.
Figure 18iiA: Frame structure for Primary Common Pilot Channel
The P-CPICH has the following characteristics:
\- The same channelization code is always used for the P-CPICH, see [8];
\- The P-CPICH is scrambled by the primary scrambling code, see [8];
\- There is one and only one P-CPICH per MBSFN cluster;
\- The P-CPICH is broadcast over the entire MBSFN cluster.
#### 5.8.2.2 Time-multiplexed Common Pilot Channel (T-CPICH)
The time-multiplexed common pilot channel (T-CPICH) is composed of a set of 15
SF=16 physical channels using 16-QAM modulation, each carrying a pre-defined
pilot bit sequence of length 64 bits. All of the channelization codes used to
carry T-CPICH are OVSF codes as defined in [8] and are orthogonal to the
P-CPICH. The T-CPICH chip-level sequence has a length of 256 chips and is
transmitted at the end of each slot of the radio frame. The T-CPICH is not
transmitted during the first 2304 chips of each slot. The structure of the
T-CPICH is shown in figure 18iiiA.
{width="5.027083333333334in" height="2.259027777777778in"}
Figure 18iiiA: Structure of the Time-multiplexed Common Pilot Channel
(T-CPICH)
The T-CPICH has the following characteristics:
\- The T-CPICH is scrambled by the same scrambling code as P-CPICH
\- There is one and only one T-CPICH per MBSFN cluster;
\- The T-CPICH is broadcasted over the entire MBSFN cluster
The UE may use the T-CPICH as the phase reference for all downlink physical
channels.
The pilot bit sequences carried on T-CPICH are defined as a function of the
scrambling code index used for the MBSFN cluster and the slot index in which
the T-CPICH is transmitted. With index _n_ of the primary scrambling code as
defined in [4] and with the index _i_ = 0 ... 14, of the slot in which the
T-CPICH is transmitted, the T-CPICH pilot bit sequences _B^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,0~
... _B^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,959~ are defined in table CD.1 of annex CD. For each
slot index _i_ , the bit sequences _B^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,0~ ... _B^(n)^_
~T-CPICH,959~ are a concatenation of the 15 bit sequences _b^(n)^_
~T-CPICH,0,_m_ ~ ... _b^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,63,_m_ ~ carried on each OVSF code
C~ch,16,_m_ ~ (see [8]) with _m_ = 1 ... 15 such that:
> { _B^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,0~ , _B^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,1~ , ... _B^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,959~ }
> = { {_b^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,0,1~, _b^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,1,1~ ... _b^(n)^_
> ~T-CPICH,63,1~ },...
>
> {_b^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,0,2~, _b^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,1,2~ ... _b^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,63,2~
> },...
>
> ...{_b^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,0,15~, _b^(n)^_ ~T-CPICH,1,15~ ... _b^(n)^_
> ~T-CPICH,63,15~} }
The OVSF code C~ch,16,0~ is not used by T-CPICH.
#### 5.8.2.3 Primary common control physical channel (P-CCPCH)
The Primary CCPCH is a fixed rate (30 kbps, SF=256) downlink physical channels
used to carry the BCH transport channel. The BCH transport channel has a fixed
transport format combination, hence the Primary CCPCH does not support TFCI.
The P-CCPCH uses QPSK modulation.
Figure 18ivA shows the frame structure of the P-CCPCH. The P-CCPCH is not
transmitted during the first and last 256 chips of each slot. Instead, Primary
SCH and Secondary SCH are transmitted during first DTX period and T-CPICH is
transmitted during the last DTX period.

Figure 18ivA: Frame structure for Primary Common Control Physical Channel
#### 5.8.2.4 Secondary common control physical channel (S-CCPCH)
The Secondary CCPCH is used to carry FACH transport channels.
For MBSFN IMB, there are two types of Secondary CCPCH:
  * Secondary CCPCH frame type 1; consists of 15 slots per radio frame
  * Secondary CCPCH frame type 2; consists of 3 slots (i.e. one sub-frame) per radio frame.
Both of the Secondary CCPCH frame types may include TFCI in order to support
multiple transport format combinations. It is the UTRAN that determines if a
TFCI should be transmitted, hence making it mandatory for all UEs to support
the use of TFCI. The structures of the Secondary CCPCH frame type 1 and
Secondary CCPCH frame type 2 are shown in figure 18vA and figure 18viA,
respectively.
Physical channel bits of Secondary CCPCH frame type 1 slots are mapped to a
QPSK signal point constellation whereas physical channel bits of Secondary
CCPCH frame type 2 can be mapped either to QPSK or 16QAM signal point
constellations. In the case of Secondary CCPCH frame type 2, the signal point
constellation to be used for the data field is given by higher layer
signalling.

Figure 18viA: Frame structure for Secondary Common Control Physical Channel
frame type 2
The parameter _m_ in figure 18viA determines the total number of bits per
Secondary CCPCH slot. The parameter _m_ takes the value of 2 for QPSK
modulation and 4 for 16-QAM modulation. The sub-frame index _i_ in figure
18viA determines the start position of the sub-frame within the radio frame.
The values for the number of bits per field are given in table 8iA in which
the channel bit and symbol rates are the rates immediately before spreading.
A FACH transport channel may be mapped to one Secondary CCPCH of frame type 1
or to one or more Secondary CCPCHs of frame type 2 that reside within the same
sub-frame.

* Slot formats applicable to 16QAM.
> ** This indicates that the number of modulation symbols occupied by TFCI is
> 4. As described in [7] and [8], QPSK modulation is applied to 8 TFCI bits
> per slot which results in the same number of 4 TFCI symbols
For slot formats using TFCI, the TFCI value in each radio frame corresponds to
a certain transport format combination of the FACHs currently in use. This
correspondence is (re-)negotiated at each FACH addition/removal. The mapping
of the TFCI bits onto slots for the IMB option is described in [7].
In the case of S-CCPCH frame type 1, when an S-CCPCH CCTrCH carries TFCI, the
TFCI field shall be present on all slots of the radio frame. In this case
there is only one S-CCPCH in the CCTrCH.
In the case of S-CCPCH frame type 2, when an S-CCPCH CCTrCH carries TFCI, the
TFCI field shall be present on all slots of the sub-frame for the S-CCPCH with
the lowest channelization code index in the CCTrCH. In this case, the TFCI
field shall not be present on the other S-CCPCHs of the same CCTrCH.
#### 5.8.2.5 Synchronisation channel (SCH)
The Synchronisation Channel (SCH) is a downlink signal used for cell search
and radio frame synchronisation on the MBSFN carrier. The SCH consists of two
sub channels, the Primary and Secondary SCH. The 10 ms radio frames of the
Primary and Secondary SCH are divided into 15 slots, each of length 2560
chips. Figure 18viiA illustrates the structure of the SCH radio frame.
{width="6.0777777777777775in" height="2.1972222222222224in"}
Figure 18viiA: Structure of Synchronisation Channel (SCH)
The Primary SCH consists of a modulated code of length 256 chips, the Primary
Synchronisation Code (PSC) denoted c~p~ in figure 18viiA, transmitted once
every slot. The PSC is the same for every cell in the system.
The Secondary SCH consists of repeatedly transmitting a length 15 sequence of
modulated codes of length 256 chips, the Secondary Synchronisation Codes
(SSC), transmitted in parallel with the Primary SCH. The SSC is denoted
c~s~^i,k^ in figure 18viiA, where _i_ = 0, 1, ..., 7 is the number of the
scrambling code group, and _k_ = 0, 1, ..., 14 is the slot number. Each SSC is
chosen from a set of 16 different codes of length 256. This sequence on the
Secondary SCH indicates which of the code groups the cell's downlink
scrambling code belongs to.
The primary and secondary synchronization codes for the MBSFN IMB option,
defined in [8], are modulated by the symbol _a = -1._
#### 5.8.2.6 The MBMS indicator channel (MICH)
The MBMS Indicator Channel (MICH) is a fixed rate (SF=256) physical channel
used to carry the MBMS notification indicators. The MICH is always associated
with an S-CCPCH frame type 1 to which a FACH transport channel carrying MBMS
control data is mapped. MICH uses QPSK modulation.
Figure 18viiiA illustrates the frame structure of the MICH where the 10 ms
radio frames of the MICH are divided into 15 slots, each of length 2560 chips.
One MICH radio frame of length 10 ms consists of 270 bits (b~0~, b~1~, ...,
b~269~). Of these, 256 bits (b~0~, b~1~, ..., b~255~) are used to carry
notification indicators. The remaining 14 bits are not formally part of the
MICH and shall not be transmitted (DTX). This implies that the transmitter is
turned off during the last 2048 chips of slot #14 in every radio frame.
{width="5.027083333333334in" height="2.259027777777778in"}
Figure 18viiiA: Frame structure for the MBMS Indicator Channel (MICH)
In each MICH frame, Nn notification indicators {N~0~, ..., N~Nn-1~} are
transmitted, where Nn=16, 32, 64, or 128.
The NI calculated by higher layers is associated to the index q of the
notification indicator N _~q~_ , where _q_ is computed as a function of the NI
computed by higher layers, the SFN of the P-CCPCH radio frame during which the
start of the MICH radio frame occurs, and the number of notification
indicators per frame (Nn):
where G = 2^16^ , C = 25033 and NI is the 16 bit Notification Indicator
calculated by higher layers.
The set of NI signalled over Iub indicates all higher layer NI values for
which the associated notification indicator on MICH shall be set to 1 during
the corresponding modification period. Hence, the calculation in the formula
above shall be performed in the Node B every MICH frame for each NI signalled
over Iub to make the association between NI and q and set the related N _~q~_
to 1. All other notification indicators on MICH shall be set to 0.
The mapping from {N~0~, ..., N~Nn-1~} to the MICH bits {b~0~, ..., b~255~} are
according to table 8iiA.

### 5.8.3 Timing relationship between physical channels
Timing between the common physical channels is summarized in figure 18ixA. The
P-CCPCH, on which the cell SFN is transmitted, is used as timing reference for
all the physical channels. The SCH, P-CPICH, T-CPICH, P-CCPCH and S-CCPCH
frame types 1 and 2 have identical radio frame timings. The sub-frame number
_i_ of an S-CCPCH frame type 2 radio frame is signalled by higher layers. The
start position of an S-CCPCH frame type 2 sub-frame is then given by$i \cdot
\text{7680}$, ($i = 0,1,2,3,4$), chips after the start of the radio frame.
The frame timing of MICH is advanced by τ~MICH~ = 3 slots (7680 chips) with
respect to the timings of the other physical channels.

Figure 18ixA: Radio frame and sub-frame timing of downlink physical channels
# 5A Physical channels for the 1.28 Mcps option
All physical channels take three-layer structure with respect to timeslots,
radio frames and system frame numbering (SFN), see [14]. Depending on the
resource allocation, the configuration of radio frames or timeslots becomes
different. All physical channels need guard symbols in every timeslot. The
time slots are used in the sense of a TDMA component to separate different
user signals in the time and the code domain. The physical channel signal
format for 1.28Mcps TDD is presented in figure 18A.
A physical channel in TDD is a burst, which is transmitted in a particular
timeslot within allocated Radio Frames. The allocation can be continuous, i.e.
the time slot in every frame is allocated to the physical channel or
discontinuous, i.e. the time slot in a subset of all frames is allocated only.
A burst is the combination of a data part, a midamble and a guard period or
only a midamble for standalone midamble channel. The duration of a burst is
one time slot. Note when in the entire carrier dedicated to MBSFN operation, a
burst is the combination of a preamble and a data part. Several bursts can be
transmitted at the same time from one transmitter. In this case, the data part
must use different OVSF channelisation codes, but the same scrambling code.
The midamble part has to use the same basic midamble code, but can use
different midambles. In a multi-frequency cell the midamble parts in different
carrier shall also have to use the same basic midamble code, but can use
different midambles. Note when in MBSFN operation, a midamble or preamble is
not necessarily cell-specific.
{width="4.877777777777778in" height="2.5708333333333333in"}
> Figure 18A: Physical channel signal format for 1.28Mcps TDD option
The data part of the burst is spread with a combination of channelisation code
and scrambling code. The channelisation code is a OVSF code, that can have a
spreading factor of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. The data rate of the physical channel
is depending on the used spreading factor of the used OVSF code.
So a physical channel is defined by frequency, timeslot, channelisation code,
burst type and Radio Frame allocation. The scrambling code and the basic
midamble code or preamble code are broadcast and may be constant within a
cell. When a physical channel is established, a start frame is given. The
physical channels can either be of infinite duration, or a duration for the
allocation can be defined.
## 5A.1 Frame structure
The TDMA frame has duration of 10 ms and is divided into 2 sub-frames of 5ms.
The frame structure for each sub-frame in the 10ms frame length is the same.
{width="5.5152777777777775in" height="1.8298611111111112in"}
Figure 18B: Structure of the sub-frame for 1.28Mcps TDD option
Time slot#n (n from 0 to 6): the n^th^ traffic time slot, 864 chips duration;
DwPTS: downlink pilot time slot, 96 chips duration;
UpPTS: uplink pilot time slot, 160 chips duration;
GP: main guard period for TDD operation, 96 chips duration;
In Figure 18B, the total number of traffic time slots for uplink and downlink
is 7, and the length for each traffic time slot is 864 chips duration. Among
the 7 traffic time slots, time slot#0 is always allocated as downlink while
time slot#1 is always allocated as uplink. The time slots for the uplink and
the downlink are separated by switching points. Between the downlink time
slots and uplink time slots, the special period is the switching point to
separate the uplink and downlink. In each sub-frame of 5ms for 1.28Mcps
option, there are two switching points (uplink to downlink and vice versa).
Using the above frame structure, the 1.28Mcps TDD option can operate on both
symmetric and asymmetric mode by properly configuring the number of downlink
and uplink time slots. In any configuration at least one time slot (time
slot#0) has to be allocated for the downlink and at least one time slot has to
be allocated for the uplink (time slot#1).
In case of entire carrier dedicated to MBSFN, no uplink timeslot is used, and
DwPTS, UpPTS and GP(96 chips duration) are combined into one short timeslot,
the duration of which is 0.275ms.
In a multi-frequency cell the traffic time slots allocated for uplink and
downlink pair(s) for one UE should be on the same carrier.
Examples for symmetric and asymmetric UL/DL allocations are given in figure
18C.

Note 1: In a multi-frequency cell, it is suggested the switching point
configuration on secondary frequencies to be the same as that on primary
frequency.
## 5A.2 Dedicated physical channel (DPCH)
The DCH as described in subclause 4.1.1 \'Dedicated transport channels\' is
mapped onto the dedicated physical channel.
### 5A.2.1 Spreading
The spreading of physical channels is the same as in 3.84 Mcps TDD (cf. 5.2.1
\'Spreading\'). When there are more than two uplink physical channels to be
transmitted in one timeslot, UE shall always guarantee the transmission of
DPCH with data to be transmitted and non-scheduled E-PUCH.
### 5A.2.2 Burst Format
A traffic burst consists of two data symbol fields, a midamble of 144 chips
and a guard period. The data fields of the burst are 352 chips long. The
corresponding number of symbols depends on the spreading factor, as indicated
in table 8A below. The guard period is 16 chip periods long.
The burst format is shown in Figure 18D. The contents of the traffic burst
fields is described in table 8B.

### 5A.2.2a Dedicated carrier MBSFN Burst Format
In this case, there are two bursts, one is MBSFN Traffic burst (MT burst) for
7 normal timeslots, and the other is MBSFN Special burst (MS burst) for 1
short timeslot. Both of them consist of a preamble and a data symbol field,
the lengths of which are different for the individual bursts. Thus, the number
of data symbols in a burst depends on the SF and the burst type, as depicted
in table 8A.a.

Spreading factor (Q) Number of symbos (N) per data field in Burst

* * *
_Note: MS burst only supports SF=16._
The support of both bursts is mandatory and only used in dedicated carrier
MBSFN. The both different bursts defined here are well suited for this
application, as described in the following paragraphs.
The MT burst can be used for the regular timeslots, the duration of which is
0.675ms. The data fields of the MT burst are 768 chips long. The corresponding
number of symbols depends on the spreading factor, as indicated in table 8A.a
above. The preamble of MT burst has a length of 96 chips. The MT burst is
shown in Figure 18D.a. The contents of the burst fields are described in table
8B.a.

The MS burst can be used for the short timeslot, the duration of which is
0.275ms. The data fields of the MS burst are 256 chips long. The corresponding
number of symbols is 16, as indicated in table 8A.a above. The preamble of the
MS burst has a length of 96 chips. The MS burst format is shown in Figure

####
#### 5A.2.2.1 Transmission of TFCI
The traffic burst format provides the possibility for transmission of TFCI in
uplink and downlink.
The transmission of TFCI is configured by higher Layers. For each CCTrCH it is
indicated by higher layer signalling, which TFCI format is applied.
Additionally for each allocated timeslot it is signalled individually whether
that timeslot carries the TFCI or not. The TFCI is always present in the first
timeslot in a radio frame for each CCTrCH. If a time slot contains the TFCI,
then it is always transmitted using the physical channel with the lowest
physical channel sequence number (_p_) in that timeslot. Physical channel
sequence numbering is determined by the rate matching function and is
described in [7].
The transmission of TFCI is done in the data parts of the respective physical
channel, this means that TFCI code word bits and data bits are subject to the
same spreading procedure as depicted in [8]. Hence the midamble structure and
length is not changed.
The TFCI code word bits are equally distributed between the two subframes and
the respective data fields. The TFCI code word is to be transmitted possibly
either directly adjacent to the midamble or after the SS and TPC symbols.
Figure 18E shows the position of the TFCI code word in a traffic burst, if
neither SS nor TPC are transmitted. Figure 18F shows the position of the TFCI
code word in a traffic burst , if SS and TPC are transmitted.

#### 5A.2.2.1a Transmission of TFCI for MT burst and MS burst
Both MT burst and MS burst provide the possibility for transmission of TFCI in
downlink. The procedure of transmitting TFCI is the same as 5A.2.2.
The transmission of TFCI is done in the data parts of the respective physical
channel, this means that TFCI code word bits and data bits are subject to the
same spreading procedure as depicted in [8]. Hence the preamble structure and
length is not changed.
The TFCI code word bits are equally distributed among the four subframes and
the respective data fields. The TFCI code word is to be transmitted directly
at the beginning and at the end of data symbols. Figure 18E.a shows the
position of the TFCI code word in the MT burst. Figure 18E.b shows the
position of the TFCI code word in the MS burst.
Note: when the modulation is 16QAM the number of the TFCI bits need be
expanded. The procedure of expansion is detailed described in [7]

#### 5A.2.2.2 Transmission of TPC
In this section, transmission of TPC over dedicated physical channels is
described. Optionally, UTRAN may configure some UL CCTrCH's to be controlled
via TPC commands on PLCCH (for example in the case of HS-DSCH operation
without an associated downlink DPCH). PLCCH is described in section 5A.3.13.
Within the context of this subclause, only those TPC commands not borne by
PLCCH (in the DL case) nor by PLCCH-controlled physical channels (in the UL
case) are considered. That is to say that those UL timeslot/CCTrCH pairs
controlled by PLCCH and those DL TPC commands mapped to PLCCH are excluded
from consideration when deriving the mapping between UL/DL TPC commands and
the UL/DL CCTrCH's they control. The association between PLCCH and UL
timeslot/CCTrCH pair(s) is signalled by higher layers.
The burst type for dedicated channels provides the possibility for
transmission of TPC in uplink and downlink.
The transmission of TPC is done in the data parts of the traffic burst. Hence
the midamble structure and length is not changed. The TPC information is to be
transmitted directly after the SS information, which is transmitted after the
midamble. Figure 18G shows the position of the TPC command in a traffic burst.
For every user the TPC information is to be transmitted at least once per 5ms
sub-frame. For each allocated timeslot it is signalled individually whether
that timeslot carries TPC information or not. If applied in a timeslot,
transmission of TPC symbols is done in the data parts of the traffic burst and
they are transmitted using the physical channel with the lowest physical
channel sequence number (_p_) in that timeslot. Physical channel sequence
numbering is determined by the rate matching function and is described in [7].
TPC symbols may also be transmitted on more than one physical channel in a
time slot. For this purpose, higher layers allocate an additional number of
N~TPC~ physical channels, individually for each time slot. The TPC symbols
shall then be transmitted using the physical channels with the N~TPC~+1 lowest
physical channel sequence numbers (_p_) in that time slot. Physical channel
sequence numbering is determined by the rate matching function and is
described in [7]. If the rate matching function results in N~RM~ \ SFN' is the system frame number counting the sub-frames. The system frame
> number of the radio frames (SFN) can be derived from SFN' by
SFN=SFN' div 2, where div is the remainder free division operation.
N~UL_PCsymbols~ is the number of UL TPC symbols in a sub-frame (excluding
those on PLCCH-controlled resources).
TPC~DLpos~ is the number of the regarded UL TPC symbol in the DL within the
sub-frame.
N~ULslot~ is the number of UL slots and CCTrCH pairs in a sub-frame (excluding
those associated with PLCCH).
When one of the above parameters is changed due to higher layer
reconfiguration, the new relationship between TPC symbols and controlled UL
time slots shall be valid, beginning with the radio frame, for which the new
parameters are set.
In Annex CB two examples of the association of TPC commands to time slots and
CCTrCH pairs are shown.
Coding of TPC:
The relationship between the TPC Bits and the transmitter power control
command for QPSK is the same as in the 3.84Mcps TDD cf. [5.2.2.5 'Transmission
of TPC'].
The relationship between the TPC Bits and the transmitter power control
command for 8PSK is given in table 8C
Table 8C: TPC Bit Pattern for 8PSK

#### 5A.2.2.3 Transmission of SS
In this section, transmission of SS over dedicated physical channels is
described. Optionally, UTRAN may configure some UL CCTrCH's to be controlled
via SS commands on PLCCH (for example in the case of HS-DSCH operation without
an associated downlink DPCH). PLCCH is described in section 5A.3.13.
Within the context of this subclause, only those SS commands not borne by
PLCCH are considered. That is to say that those UL timeslots controlled
exclusively by PLCCH and those SS commands carried by PLCCH are excluded from
consideration when deriving the mapping between DL SS commands and the UL
timeslots they control. The association between PLCCH and UL timeslot/CCTrCH
pair(s) is signalled by higher layers.
The burst type for dedicated channels provides the possibility for
transmission of uplink synchronisation control (ULSC).
The transmission of ULSC is done in the data parts of the traffic burst. Hence
the midamble structure and length is not changed. The ULSC information is to
be transmitted directly after the midamble. Figure 18H shows the position of
the SS command in a traffic burst.
For every user the ULSC information shall be transmitted at least once per
transmitted sub-frame.
For each allocated timeslot it is signalled individually whether that timeslot
carries ULSC information or not. If applied in a time slot, transmission of SS
symbols is done in the data parts of the traffic burst and they are
transmitted using the physical channel with the lowest physical channel
sequence number (_p_) in that timeslot. Physical channel sequence numbering is
determined by the rate matching function and is described in [7].
SS symbols may also be transmitted on more than one physical channel in a time
slot. For this purpose, higher layers allocate an additional number of N~SS~
physical channels, individually for each time slot. The SS symbols shall then
be transmitted using the physical channels with the N~SS~+1 lowest physical
channel sequence numbers (_p_) in that time slot. Physical channel sequence
numbering is determined by the rate matching function and is described in [7].
If the rate matching function results in N~RM~ \ Case 1) The beacon function shall be provided by the physical channels that
> are allocated to channelisation code $C_{Q = \text{32}}^{(k = 1)}$and to
> TS#k, k=0,...,14.
>
> Case 2) The beacon function shall be provided by the physical channels that
> are allocated to channelisation code $C_{Q = \text{32}}^{(k = 1)}$and to
> TS#k and TS#k+8, k=0,...,6.
Note that by this definition the P-CCPCH always has beacon characteristics.
### 5B.6.2 Physical characteristics of beacon channels
The beacon channels shall have the following physical characteristics. They:
\- are transmitted with reference power;
\- are transmitted without beamforming;
\- use burst type 1 or burst type 4 when MBSFN is applied to beacon channels;
\- use midamble m^(1)^ and m^(2)^ exclusively in this time slot; and
\- midambles m^(9)^ and m^(10)^ are always left unused in this time slot, if
16 midambles are allowed in that cell.
Note that in the time slot where the P-CCPCH is transmitted only the midambles
m^(1)^ to m^(8)^ shall be used, see 5B.7.1. Thus, midambles m^(9)^ and m^(10)^
are always left unused in this time slot.
Note that when MBSFN is applied to beacon channels there is a single midamble
and hence midamble m^(1)^ is exclusively used in the timeslot.
The reference power corresponds to the sum of the power allocated to both
midambles m^(1)^ and m^(2)^. Two possibilities exist:
\- If SCTD antenna diversity is not applied to beacon channels all the
reference power of any beacon channel is allocated to m^(1)^.
\- If SCTD antenna diversity is applied to beacon channels, for any beacon
channel midambles m^(1)^ and m^(2)^ are each allocated half of the reference
power.
## 5B.7 Midamble Allocation for Physical Channels
Midamble allocation for physical channels is identical to 3.84Mcps TDD
[section 5.6]. The association between midambles and channelisation codes is
given in Annex AB.3.
## 5B.8 Midamble Transmit Power
There shall be no offset between the sum of the powers allocated to all
midambles in a timeslot and the sum of the powers allocated to the data symbol
fields. The transmit power within a timeslot is hence constant.
The midamble transmit power of beacon channels is equal to the reference
power. If SCTD is used for beacon channels, the reference power is equally
divided between the midambles m^(1)^ and m^(2)^.
The midamble transmit power of all other physical channels depends on the
midamble allocation scheme used. The following rules apply
\- In case of Default Midamble Allocation, every midamble is transmitted with
the same power as the associated codes.
\- In case of Common Midamble Allocation in the downlink, the transmit power
of this common midamble is such that there is no power offset between the data
parts and the midamble part of the overall transmit signal within one time
slot.
\- In case of UE Specific Midamble Allocation, the transmit power of the UE
specific midamble is such that there is no power offset between the data parts
and the midamble part of every user within one time slot.
The following figure 18AQ depicts the midamble powers for the different
channel types and midamble allocation schemes.
Note 1: In figure 18AQ, the codes c(1) to c(32) represent the set of usable
codes and not the set of used codes.
Note 2: The common midamble allocation and the midamble allocation by higher
layers are not applicable in those beacon time slots, in which the P-CCPCH is
located, see section 5B.7.

## 6.1 Dedicated Transport Channels
### 6.1.1 The Dedicated Channel (DCH)
A dedicated transport channel is mapped onto one or more physical channels. An
interleaving period is associated with each allocation. The frame is
subdivided into slots that are available for uplink and downlink information
transfer. The mapping of transport blocks on physical channels is described in
TS 25.222 (\"multiplexing and channel coding\").
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="1.5631944444444446in"}
Figure 20: Mapping of Transport Blocks onto the physical bearer
For NRT packet data services, shared channels (USCH and DSCH) can be used to
allow efficient allocations for a short period of time.
### 6.1.2 The Enhanced Uplink Dedicated Channel (E-DCH)
The enhanced uplink dedicated channel is mapped on one or several E-PUCH, see
subclause 5.3.13.
#### 6.1.2.1 E-DCH/E-AGCH Association and Timing
The E-DCH is always associated with a number of E-DCH Absolute Grant Channels
(E-AGCH) and one hybrid ARQ indicator channel (E-HICH). A grant of E-DCH
transmission resources may be transmitted to the UE on any one of the
associated E-AGCH. All relevant Layer 1 control information related to an
E-DCH TTI is transmitted in the associated E-AGCH and E-HICH.
The E-DCH related time slot information that is carried on the E-AGCH refers
to the next valid E-PUCH allocation, which is given by the following
limitation: There shall be an offset of n~E-AGCH~ ≥ 6 time slots between the
E-AGCH carrying the E-DCH related information and the first indicated E-PUCH
(in time) for a given UE. The E-DCH related time slot information shall not
refer to two subsequent radio frames but shall always refer to either the same
or the following radio frame, as illustrated in figure 20a. Note that the
figure only shows the E-AGCH that carries the E-DCH related information for
the given UE.
Figure 20a: Timing for E-AGCH and E-DCH for different radio frame
configurations for a given UE
#### 6.1.2.2 E-DCH/E-HICH Association and Timing
All E-DCH operations within the cell are associated with the same E-HICH
channelisation code. A single E-HICH channelisation code exists in the cell
per E-DCH TTI (10ms). For a given UE, a HARQ acknowledgement indicator is
synchronously linked with the E-DCH TTI transmission to which it relates.
There is thus a one-to-one association between an E-DCH TTI transmission and
its respective HARQ acknowledgment indicator on the associated E-HICH.
The associated E-HICH shall reside on the first instance of the E-HICH
channelisation code to occur after n~E-HICH~ timeslots have elapsed since the
start of the last E-PUCH of the corresponding E-DCH TTI (see examples of
figure 20b). The value of n~E-HICH~ is configurable by higher layers within
the range 4 to 44 timeslots.
Figure 20b: Timing for E-DCH and E-HICH for a given UE
The HARQ acknowledgement indicator associated with an E-DCH transmission is
transmitted using one of 240 signature sequences carried by the associated
E-HICH channelisation code. Which signature sequence _r = 0, 1, 2,...239_ is
used is calculated for each E-DCH resource allocation using the information
signalled on the associated E-AGCH as follows:
  * where:
    * t~0~ is the bit position (1...n~TRRI~) of the first active timeslot in the timeslot resource related information bitmap (see [7]) on E-AGCH and where bit position 1 corresponds to the lowest-numbered timeslot
    * q~0~ is the allocated channelisation code index (1,2,3,...Q~0~)
    * Q~0~ is the spreading factor of the allocated uplink channelisation code
## 6.2 Common Transport Channels
### 6.2.1 The Broadcast Channel (BCH)
The BCH is mapped onto the P-CCPCH. The secondary SCH codes indicate in which
timeslot a mobile can find the P-CCPCH containing BCH.
### 6.2.2 The Paging Channel (PCH)
The PCH is mapped onto one or several S-CCPCHs so that capacity can be matched
to requirements. The location of the PCH is indicated on the BCH. It is always
transmitted at a reference power level.
To allow an efficient DRX, the PCH is divided into PCH blocks, each of which
comprising N~PCH~ paging sub-channels. N~PCH~ is configured by higher layers.
Each paging sub-channel is mapped onto 2 consecutive PCH frames within one PCH
block. Layer 3 information to a particular UE is transmitted only in the
paging sub-channel, that is assigned to the UE by higher layers, see [15]. The
assignment of UEs to paging sub-channels is independent of the assignment of
UEs to page indicators.
#### 6.2.2.1 PCH/PICH Association
As depicted in figure 21, a paging block consists of one PICH block and one
PCH block. If a paging indicator in a certain PICH block is set to \'1\' it is
an indication that UEs associated with this paging indicator shall read their
corresponding paging sub-channel within the same paging block. The value
N~GAP~>0 of frames between the end of the PICH block and the beginning of the
PCH block is configured by higher layers.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="2.1625in"}
Figure 21: Paging Sub-Channels and Association of PICH and PCH blocks
### 6.2.3 The Forward Channel (FACH)
The FACH is mapped onto one or several S-CCPCHs. The location of the FACH is
indicated on the BCH and both, capacity and location can be changed, if
required. FACH may or may not be power controlled.
### 6.2.4 The Random Access Channel (RACH)
The RACH has intraslot interleaving only and is mapped onto PRACH. The same
slot may be used for PRACH by more than one cell. Multiple transmissions using
different spreading codes may be received in parallel. More than one slot per
frame may be administered for the PRACH. The location of slots allocated to
PRACH is broadcast on the BCH. The PRACH uses open loop power control. The
details of the employed open loop power control algorithm may be different
from the corresponding algorithm on other channels.
### 6.2.5 The Uplink Shared Channel (USCH)
The uplink shared channel is mapped on one or several PUSCH, see subclause
5.3.5.
### 6.2.6 The Downlink Shared Channel (DSCH)
The downlink shared channel is mapped on one or several PDSCH, see subclause
5.3.6.
### 6.2.7 The High Speed Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH)
The high speed downlink shared channel is mapped on one or several HS-PDSCH,
see subclause 5.3.9.
#### 6.2.7.1 HS-DSCH/HS-SCCH Association and Timing
The HS-DSCH is always associated with a number of High Speed Shared Control
Channels (HS-SCCH). The number of HS-SCCHs that are associated with an HS-DSCH
for one UE can range from a minimum of one HS-SCCH (M=1) to a maximum of four
HS-SCCH (M=4). All relevant Layer 1 control information is transmitted in the
associated HS-SCCH i.e. the HS-PDSCH does not carry any Layer 1 control
information.
The HS-DSCH related time slot information that is carried on the HS-SCCH
refers to the next valid HS-PDSCH allocation, which is given by the following
limitation: There shall be an offset of n~HS-SCCH~ ≥ 4 time slots between the
HS-SCCH carrying the HS-DSCH related information and the first indicated HS-
PDSCH (in time) for a given UE. The HS-DSCH related time slot information
shall not refer to two subsequent radio frames but shall always refer to
either the same or the following radio frame, as illustrated in figure 21A.
Note that the figure only shows the HS-SCCH that carries the HS-DSCH related
information for the given UE.
Figure 21A: Timing for HS-SCCH and HS-DSCH for different radio frame
configurations for a given UE
#### 6.2.7.2 HS-SCCH/HS-DSCH/HS-SICH Association and Timing
The HS-SCCH is always associated with one HS-SICH. The association between the
HS-SCCH in DL and HS-SICH in UL shall be pre-defined by higher layers and is
common for all UEs.
The UE shall transmit the HS-DSCH related ACK / NACK on the next available
associated HS-SICH with the following limitation: There shall be an offset of
n~HS-SICH~ ≥ 17 time slots between the last allocated HS-PDSCH (in time) and
the HS-SICH for the given UE. Hence, the HS-SICH transmission shall be made in
the next or next but one radio frame, following the HS-DSCH transmission, as
illustrated in figure 21B. Note that the figure only shows the HS-SICH that
carries the HS-DSCH related ACK / NACK for the given UE.

as in 3.84 Mcps TDD but due to the subframe structure the coded bits are
mapped onto each of the subframes within the given TTI.

### 7.1.2 The Enhanced Uplink Dedicated Channel (E-DCH)
The enhanced uplink dedicated channel is mapped on one or several E-PUCH, see
subclause 5A.3.14.
#### 7.1.2.1 E-DCH/E-AGCH Association and Timing
The E-DCH is always associated with a number of E-DCH Absolute Grant Channels
(E-AGCH) and up to four hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (E-HICH). A grant of
E-DCH transmission resources may be transmitted to the UE on any one of the
associated E-AGCH. All relevant Layer 1 control information related to an
E-DCH TTI is transmitted in the associated E-AGCH and E-HICH.
The E-DCH related timeslot information that is carried on the E-AGCH refers to
the next valid E-PUCH allocation, which is given by the following limitation:
There shall be an offset of n~E-AGCH~ ≥ 7 time slots between the E-AGCH
carrying the E-DCH related information and the first indicated E-PUCH (in
time) for a given UE. DwPTS and UpPTS shall not be taken into account in this
limitation as illustrated in figure 23A. Note that the figure only shows the
E-AGCH that carries the E-DCH related information for the given UE and that
DwPTS and UpPTS are not considered in this figure.
Figure 23A: Timing for E-AGCH and E-PUCH for different radio frame
configurations for a given UE
For the semi-persistent E-DCH resources, the timing between E-AGCH and the
first E-PUCH can also use the same limitation: There shall be an offset of
n~E-AGCH~ ≥ 7 time slots between the E-AGCH carrying the semi-persistent E-DCH
related information and the first indicated semi-persistent E-PUCH (in time)
for a given UE. Once the semi-persistent resources are assigned to UE, UE can
use these resources continuously until the semi-persistent resources have been
released or reconfigured by Node B or RNC.
#### 7.1.2.2 E-DCH/E-HICH Association and Timing
For a given UE, a HARQ acknowledgement indicator (E-HICH) is synchronously
linked with the E-DCH TTI transmission to which it relates.
The associated E-HICH shall reside on the first E-HICH instance of the E-HICH
channelisation code to occur after n~E-HICH~ timeslots have elapsed since the
start of the last E-PUCH of the corresponding E-DCH TTI (see examples of
figure 23B). DwPTS and UpPTS are not considered in the figure. The value of
n~E-HICH~ is configurable by higher layers within the range 4 to 15 timeslots.
DwPTS and UpPTS shall not be taken into account in this limitation.

## 7.2 Common Transport Channels
### 7.2.1 The Broadcast Channel (BCH)
There are two P-CCPCHs, P-CCPCH 1 and P-CCPCH 2 which are mapped onto
timeslot#0 using the channelisation codes {width="0.3611111111111111in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"} and {width="0.3888888888888889in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"} with spreading factor 16. The BCH is mapped
onto the P-CCPCH1+P-CCPCH2.
The position of the P-CCPCHs is indicated by the relative phases of the bursts
in the DwPTS with respect to the P-CCPCHs midamble sequences, see [8]. One
special combination of the phase differences of the burst in the DwPTS with
respect to the P-CCPCH midamble indicates the position of the P-CCPCH in the
multi-frame and the start position of the interleaving period.
### 7.2.2 The Paging Channel (PCH)
If the PICH is associated with an S-CCPCH to which a PCH transport channel is
mapped, the mapping of Paging Channels onto S-CCPCHs and the association
between PCHs and Paging Indicator Channels is the same as in the 3.84 Mcps TDD
option, cf. 6.2.2 \'The paging Channel\' and 6.2.2.1 \'PCH/PICH Association\'
respectively.
### 7.2.3 The Forward Channel (FACH)
The FACH is mapped onto one or several S-CCPCHs. The location of the FACH is
indicated on the BCH and both, capacity and location can be changed, if
required. FACH may or may not be power controlled.
### 7.2.4 The Random Access Channel (RACH)
The RACH is mapped onto PRACH. More than one slot per frame may be
administered for the PRACH. The location of slots allocated to PRACH is
broadcast on the BCH. The uplink sync codes (SYNC-UL sequences) used by the
UEs for UL synchronisation have a well known association with the P-RACHs, as
broadcast on the BCH. On the PRACH, both power control and uplink
synchronisation control are used.
### 7.2.5 The Uplink Shared Channel (USCH)
The uplink shared channel is mapped onto one or several PUSCH, see subclause
5A.3.6 'Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)'
### 7.2.6 The Downlink Shared Channel (DSCH)
The downlink shared channel is mapped onto one or several PDSCH, see subclause
5A.3.7 'Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH)'
### 7.2.7 The High Speed Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH)
The high speed downlink shared channel is mapped on one or several HS-PDSCH,
see subclause 5A.3.9.
#### 7.2.7.1 HS-DSCH/HS-SCCH Association and Timing
The HS-DSCH can be associated with a number of High Speed Shared Control
Channels (HS-SCCH). In a multi-frequency HS-DSCH cell, HS-DSCH may be mapped
on HS-PDSCHs on one or more carrier in CELL_DCH state and on only one carrier
in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH state for UE supporting multi-carrier HS-
DSCH reception configured by higher layers. HS-DSCH transmission on each
carrier is associated with a HS-SCCH subset and the number of HS-SCCHs in one
HS-SCCH subset can range from a minimum of one HS-SCCH (M=1) to a maximum of
four HS-SCCH (M=4). All the HS-SCCH subsets for one UE constitute a HS-SCCH
set. For UE not supporting multi-carrier HS-DSCH reception, only one HS-SCCH
subset is allocated by higher layers. All relevant Layer 1 control information
is transmitted in the associated HS-SCCH i.e. the HS-PDSCH does not carry any
Layer 1 control information.
The HS-DSCH related time slot information that is carried on the HS-SCCH
refers to the next valid HS-PDSCH allocation, which is given by the following
limitation: The indicated HS-PDSCH shall be on the sub-frame next to the HS-
SCCH carrying the HS-DSCH related information. The HS-DSCH related time slot
information shall not refer to two subsequent sub-frames but shall always
refer to the following sub-frame, as illustrated in figure 24. Note that the
figure only shows the HS-SCCH that carries the HS-DSCH related information for
the given UE and that DwPTS and UpPTS are not considered in this figure. In
case of multi-carrier HS-DSCH reception, the timing for HS-DSCH transmission
on each carrier and its associated HS-SCCH applies the same rule.
For the semi-persistent HS-DSCH resources, the timing between HS-SCCH and the
first HS-PDSCH applies the rule that, if the HS-SCCH is transmitted in
subframe N, then the first HS-PDSCH is transmitted in subframe N+2, as
illustrated in figure 24A. Once the semi-persistent resources are assigned to
UE, UE can use these resources continuously until the semi-persistent
resources have been released or reconfigured by Node B or RNC.
Figure 24: Timing for HS-SCCH and HS-DSCH for different radio frame
configurations for a given UE
Figure 24A: Timing for HS-SCCH and first semi-persistent HS-DSCH for different
radio frame configurations for a given UE
#### 7.2.7.2 HS-SCCH/HS-DSCH/HS-SICH Association and Timing
The HS-SCCH is always associated with one HS-SICH, carrying the ACK/NACK and
Channel Quality information (CQI). The association between the HS-SCCH in DL
and HS-SICH in UL shall be pre-defined by higher layers and is common for all
UEs. For the HS-DSCH semi-persistent scheduling operation, the associated HS-
SICH to the HS-DSCH is conveyed by HS-SICH Indicator on HS-SCCH.
The UE in CELL_DCH state and in CELL_FACH state with a dedicated UE identity
shall transmit the HS-DSCH related ACK / NACK on the next available associated
HS-SICH with the following limitation: There shall be an offset of n~HS-SICH~
≥ 9 time slots between the last allocated HS-PDSCH (in time) and the HS-SICH
for the given UE. DwPTS and UpPTS shall not be taken into account in this
limitation. Hence, the HS-SICH transmission shall always be made in the next
but one sub-frame, following the HS-DSCH transmission, as illustrated in
figure 25. Note that the figure only shows the HS-SICH that carries the HS-
DSCH related ACK / NACK for the given UE and that DwPTS and UpPTS are not
considered in this figure. In case of multi-carrier HS-DSCH reception, the
timing for HS-DSCH transmission on each carrier and its related HS-SICH
applies the same rule. For the HS-SCCH order which is an uplink
synchronization establishment order for UEs in CELL_FACH and CELL_PCH state,
the UE shall not transmit associated HS-SICH.

Figure 25: Timing for HS-DSCH and HS-SICH for different radio frame
configurations for a given UE
There shall be an associated HS-SICH for the HS-SCCH command for allocation or
release of the semi-persistent HS-PDSCH resources and HS-SCCH command for
activation or deactivation of DRX. There shall also be an associated HS-SICH
for HS-SCCH type1 or HS-SCCH type 4 or HS-SCCH type 8 with transport block
size information set to all zeros. There is no associated HS-PDSCH in these
cases. The timing between the HS-SCCH and the HS-SICH for the given UE as
illustrated in figure 25A. The UE shall transmit the HS-SCCH related ACK on
the next available associated HS-SICH with the following limitation: There
shall be an offset of n'~HS-SICH~ ≥ 14 time slots between the HS-SCCH (in
time) and the HS-SICH for the given UE. DwPTS and UpPTS shall not be taken
into account in this limitation.

configurations for a given UE
#### 7.2.7.3 PICH/HS-SCCH/HS-DSCH Association and Timing
When the UE in CELL_PCH state with a dedicated UE identity detects the PICH
identifying DCCH/DTCH/BCCH transmission, the UE shall receive the
corresponding HS-SCCH subframes. The association and timing between PICH and
HS-SCCH is depicted in figure 25A. If a paging indicator in a certain PICH
block is set to \'1\' it is an indication that UEs associated with this paging
indicator shall read their corresponding HS-SCCH in the M frames where M is
Reception window size configured by higher layers. The value N~GAP~>0 of
frames between the end of the PICH block and the beginning of the HS-SCCH is
configured by higher layers. Note: for DCCH/DTCH transmission, HS-SCCH shall
be HS-SCCH order; while for BCCH transmission, the association and timing
between HS-SCCH and HS-DSCH is the same as described in subclause 7.2.7.1.
Figure 25A: Timing for PICH and HS-SCCH for different radio frame
configurations for a given UE
#### 7.2.7.4 PICH/ HS-DSCH Association and Timing
When the UE in URA_PCH or CELL_PCH state without a dedicated UE identity
detects the PICH identifying PCCH transmission, the UE shall receive the
corresponding HS-DSCH TTIs. The association and timing between PICH and HS-
DSCH is depicted in figure 25B. If a paging indicator in a certain PICH block
is set to \'1\' it is an indication that UEs associated with this paging
indicator shall read their corresponding sub-channel and consider that paging
message is retransmitted in 2*m subframes where m denotes Paging Sub-Channel
Size configured by higher layers which is the number of frames that each
paging sub-channel occupies. The value N~GAP~>0 of frames between the end of
the PICH block and the beginning of the HS-DSCH is configured by higher
layers.

## 8.1 Dedicated Transport Channels
### 8.1.1 The Dedicated Channel (DCH)
Mapping of dedicated transport channels to physical channels is identical to
3.84Mcps TDD cf. [6.1 Dedicated Transport Channels].
### 8.1.2 The Enhanced Uplink Dedicated Channel (E-DCH)
The enhanced uplink dedicated channel is mapped on one or several E-PUCH, see
subclause 5B.4.12.
#### 8.1.2.1 E-DCH/E-AGCH Association and Timing
The E-DCH is always associated with a number of E-DCH Absolute Grant Channels
(E-AGCH) and with one or two hybrid ARQ indicator channels (E-HICH). A grant
of E-DCH transmission resources may be transmitted to the UE on any one of the
associated E-AGCH. All relevant Layer 1 control information related to an
E-DCH TTI is transmitted in the associated E-AGCH and one of the E-HICHs.
The E-DCH related time slot information that is carried on the E-AGCH refers
to the next valid E-PUCH allocation, which is given by the following
limitation: There shall be an offset of n~E-AGCH~ ≥ 6 time slots between the
E-AGCH carrying the E-DCH related information and the first indicated E-PUCH
(in time) for a given UE. The E-DCH related time slot information shall not
refer to two subsequent radio frames but shall always refer to either the same
or the following radio frame, as illustrated in figure 27. Note that the
figure only shows the E-AGCH that carries the E-DCH related information for
the given UE.
Figure 27: Timing for E-AGCH and E-DCH for different radio frame
configurations for a given UE
#### 8.1.2.2 E-DCH/E-HICH Association and Timing
E-DCH operations within the cell are associated with one or two channelisation
codes carrying E-HICH (E-HICH~1~ and E-HICH~2~). If the number of timeslots
configured for E-DCH use is 7 or more (this corresponds to the length of the
timeslot resource related information field on E-AGCH -- see [7]), both
E-HICH~1~ and E-HICH~2~ channelisation codes shall be configured by higher
layers, otherwise only the channelisation code E-HICH~1~ is configured.
A single instance of E-HICH~1~ (and E-HICH~2~ if configured) channelisation
codes exist in the cell per E-DCH TTI (10ms). For a given UE, a HARQ
acknowledgement indicator is synchronously linked with the E-DCH TTI
transmission to which it relates. There is thus a one-to-one association
between an E-DCH TTI transmission and its respective HARQ acknowledgment
indicator on one of the associated E-HICHs.
For each channelisation code carrying E-HICH, the associated instance shall be
the first instance of that channelisation code to occur after n~E-HICH~
timeslots have elapsed since the start of the last E-PUCH of the corresponding
E-DCH TTI (see examples of figure 28). The value of n~E-HICH~ is configurable
by higher layers within the range 4 to 44 timeslots.
Figure 28: Timing for E-DCH and E-HICH for a given UE
The HARQ acknowledgement indicator associated with an E-DCH transmission is
transmitted using one of 240 signature sequences carried by one of the
associated E-HICH channelisation codes. Which signature sequence _r = 0, 1,
2,...239_ and (in the case that two channelisation codes are configured for
E-HICH) which channelisation code is used are calculated for each E-DCH
resource allocation using the following information signalled on the
associated E_AGCH:
  * t~0~ is the bit position (1...n~TRRI~) of the first active timeslot in the timeslot resource related information bitmap (see [7]) on E-AGCH and where bit position 1 corresponds to the lowest-numbered timeslot
  * q~0~ is the allocated channelisation code index (1,2,3,...Q~0~)
  * Q~0~ is the spreading factor of the allocated uplink channelisation code
The value _r'_ is first calculated as:
Then:
  * if _r'_ ≤239, _r_ = _r'_ and channelisation code E-HICH~1~ is used
  * if _r'_ >239, _r_ = (_r'_ -240) and channelisation code E-HICH~2~ is used.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Basic Midamble Codes for the 3.84 Mcps option
# A.1 Basic Midamble Codes for Burst Type 1 and 3
In the case of burst type 1 or 3 (see subclause 5.2.2) the midamble has a
length of Lm=512, which is corresponding to:
K'=8; W=57; P=456.
Depending on the possible delay spread timeslots are configured to use K~Cell~
midambles which are generated from the Basic Midamble Codes (see table A.1)
\- for all k=1,2,...,K; K=2K' or
\- for k=1,2,...,K', only, or
\- for odd k=1,3,5,...,≤ K', only.
In the beacon slot #k, where the P-CCPCH is located, the number of midambles
K~Cell~=8 (cf section 5.6.1). In all of the other timeslots that use burst
type 1 or 3, K~Cell~ is individually configured from higher layers.
Depending on the cell size midambles for PRACH are generated from the Basic
Midamble Codes (see table A.1)
\- for k=1,2,...,K' or
\- for odd k=1,3,5,...,≤ K', only.
The mapping of these Basic Midamble Codes to Cell Parameters is shown in TS
25.223.

# A.2 Basic Midamble Codes for Burst Type 2 and 4
In the case of burst type 2 (see subclause 5.2.2) the midamble has a length of
Lm=256, which is corresponding to:
K'=3; W=64; P=192.
Depending on the possible delay spread timeslots are configured to use K~Cell~
midambles which are generated from the Basic Midamble Codes (see table A.2)
\- for all k=1,2,...,K; K=2K' or
\- for k=1,2,...,K', only.
In all timeslots that use burst type 2, K~Cell~ is individually configured
from higher layers.
In the case of burst type 4 (see subclause 5.2.2) the midamble has a length of
L~m~=320, which corresponds to:
K=K\'=1; W=128; P=192.
Thus for burst type 4, K~Cell~ shall have a value of 1 and the midamble is
generated from the Basic Midamble Codes (see table A.2).
The mapping of these Basic Midamble Codes to Cell Parameters is shown in TS
25.223.
Table A.2: Basic Midamble Codes {width="0.2638888888888889in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"} according to equation (5) from subclause 5A.2.3
for case of burst types 2 and 4

# A.3 Association between Midambles and Channelisation Codes
The following mapping schemes apply for the association between midambles and
channelisation codes if no midamble is allocated by higher layers. Secondary
channelisation codes are marked with a *. These associations apply both for UL
and DL.
## A.3.1 Association for Burst Type 1/3 and K~Cell~ =16 Midambles
{width="3.777083333333333in" height="3.4805555555555556in"}
Figure A.1: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for Burst Type 1/3 and
K~Cell~ =16
## A.3.2 Association for Burst Type 1/3 and K~Cell~ =8 Midambles
Figure A.2: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for Burst Type 1/3 and
K~Cell~ =8
## A.3.3 Association for Burst Type 1/3 and K~Cell~ =4 Midambles
Figure A.3: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for Burst Type 1/3 and
K~Cell~ =4
## A.3.4 Association for Burst Type 2 and K~Cell~ =6 Midambles
Figure A.4: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for Burst Type 2 and
K~Cell~ =6
## A.3.5 Association for Burst Type 2 and K~Cell~ =3 Midambles
Figure A.5: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for Burst Type 2 and
K~Cell~ =3
Note that the association for burst type 2 can be derived from the association
for burst type 1 and 3, using the following table:
* * *
Burst Type 1/3 m(1) m(2) m(3) m(4) m(5) m(6) m(7) m(8) Burst Type 2 m(1) m(5)
m(3) m(6) m(2) m(4) - -
* * *
## A.3.6 Association for Burst Type 4 and K~Cell~ =1 Midamble
For burst type 4 there is only a single midamble defined, thus all
channelisation codes are associated with the same midamble.
###### ## Annex AA (normative): Basic Midamble Codes for the 1.28 Mcps option
# AA.1 Basic Midamble Codes
The midamble has a length of L~m~=144, which is corresponding to:
K=2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, {width="0.6805555555555556in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"} , P=128
Note: that {width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.25in"} denotes the largest
integer number less or equal to _x_.
Depending on the possible delay spread timeslots are configured to use K
midambles. In timeslot 0 the number of midambles K=8 (cf section 6.6.1). In
all of the other timeslots, K is individually configured from higher layers.
The K midambles are generated from one of the basic midamble codes shown in
table AA.1.
The mapping of these Basic Midamble Codes to Cell Parameters is shown in [8].

###### ## Annex AB (normative): Basic Midamble Codes for the 7.68 Mcps option
# AB.1 Basic Midamble Codes for Burst Type 1 and 3
In the case of burst type 1 or 3 (see subclause 5B.3.2) the midamble has a
length of Lm=1024, which corresponds to:
K'=8; W=114; P=912.
Depending on the possible delay spread cells are configured to use K~Cell~
midambles which are generated from the Basic Midamble Codes of length 912
defined in table AB.1 below
\- for all k=1,2,...,K; K=2K' or
\- for k=1,2,...,K', only, or
\- for odd k=1,3,5,...,≤ K', only.
In the beacon slot #k, where the P-CCPCH is located, the number of midambles
K~Cell~=8 (cf section 5B.7). In all of the other timeslots that use burst type
1 or 3, K~Cell~ is individually configured from higher layers.
The mapping of these Basic Midamble Codes to Cell Parameters is shown in TS
25.223.

# AB.2 Basic Midamble Codes for Burst Type 2
In the case of burst type 2 (see subclause 5B.3.2) the midamble has a length
of Lm=512, which corresponds to:
K'=8; W=57; P=456.
Depending on the possible delay spread cells are configured to use K~Cell~
midambles which are generated from the Basic Midamble Codes of length P
defined in Annex A.1.
\- for k=1,2,...,K', only, or
\- for odd k=1,3,5,...,≤ K', only.
# AB.2A Basic Midamble Codes for Burst Type 4
In the case of burst type 4 (see subclause 5B.3.2.3A) the midamble has a
length of Lm=640, which corresponds to:
K=K\'=1; W=256; P=384.
Thus for burst type 4, K~Cell~ shall have a value of 1 and the midamble is
generated from the Basic Midamble Codes (see table AB.2).
The mapping of these Basic Midamble Codes to Cell Parameters is shown in TS
25.223.
Table AB.2: Basic Midamble Codes {width="0.2638888888888889in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"} according to equation (5) from subclause 5B.3.3
for the case of burst type 4

# AB.3 Association between Midambles and Channelisation Codes
The following mapping schemes apply for the association between midambles and
channelisation codes if no midamble is allocated by higher layers. These
mapping schemes apply for all burst types 1,2 and 3. Secondary channelisation
codes are marked with a *. These associations apply both for UL and DL.
## AB.3.1 Association for K~Cell~ = 16 Midambles
Figure AB.1: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for K~Cell~ = 16
## AB.3.2 Association for K~Cell~ = 8 Midambles
Figure AB.2: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for K~Cell~ = 8
## AB.3.3 Association for K~Cell~ = 4 Midambles
Figure AB.3: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for K~Cell~ = 4
## AB.3.4 Association for Burst Types 4 and K~Cell~ =1 Midamble
For burst type 4 there is only a single midamble defined, thus all
channelisation codes are associated with the same midamble.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Signalling of the number of channelisation
codes for the DL common midamble case for 3.84Mcps TDD
The following mapping schemes shall apply for the association between the
number of channelisation codes employed in a timeslot and the use of a
particular midamble shift in the DL common midamble case. In the following
tables the presence of a particular midamble shift is indicated by '1'.
Midamble shifts marked with '0' are left unused. Mapping schemes B.4, B.5 and
B.6 are not applicable to beacon timeslots where a P-CCPCH is present, because
the default midamble allocation scheme is applied to these timeslots. Note
that in mapping schemes B.4, B.5 and B.6, the fixed and pre-allocated
channelisation code for the beacon channel is included into the number of
indicated channelisation codes.

###### ## Annex C (informative): CCPCH Multiframe Structure for the 3.84 Mcps
option
In the following figures C.1 to C.3 some examples for Multiframe Structures on
Primary and Secondary CCPCH are given. The figures show the placement of
Common Transport Channels on the Common Control Physical Channels. Additional
S-CCPCH capacity can be allocated on other codes and timeslots of course, e.g.
FACH capacity is related to overall cell capacity and can be configured
according to the actual needs. Channel capacities in the annex are derived
using bursts with long midambles (Burst format 1). Every TrCH-box in the
figures is assumed to be valid for two frames (see row 'Frame #'), i.e. the
transport channels in CCPCHs have an interleaving time of 20msec.
The actual CCPCH Multiframe Scheme used in the cell is described and broadcast
on BCH. Thus the system information structure has its roots in this particular
transport channel and allocations of other Common Channels can be handled this
way, i.e. by pointing from BCH.
