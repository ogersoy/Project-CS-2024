# 4 Control of UE/UTRAN measurements
In this chapter the general measurement control concept of the higher layers
is briefly described to provide an understanding on how L1 measurements are
initiated and controlled by higher layers.
L1 provides with the measurement specifications a toolbox of measurement
abilities for the UE and the UTRAN. These measurements can be differentiated
in different reported measurement types: intra-frequency, inter-frequency,
inter-system, traffic volume, quality and UE internal measurements (see [14]).
In the L1 measurement specifications the measurements, see chapter 5, are
distinguished between measurements in the UE (the messages will be described
in the RRC Protocol or MAC Protocol [22]) and measurements in the UTRAN (the
messages will be described in the NBAP and the Frame Protocol).
To initiate a specific measurement the UTRAN transmits a \'measurement control
message\' to the UE including a measurement ID and type, a command (setup,
modify, release), the measurement objects and quantity, the reporting
quantities, criteria (periodical/event-triggered) and mode
(acknowledged/unacknowledged), see [14].
When the reporting criteria is fulfilled the UE shall answer with a
\'measurement report message\' to the UTRAN including the measurement ID and
the results.
In idle mode the measurement control message is broadcast in a System
Information.
Intra-frequency reporting events, traffic volume reporting events and UE
internal measurement reporting events described in [14] define events which
trigger the UE to send a report to the UTRAN. This defines a toolbox from
which the UTRAN can choose the needed reporting events.
# 5 Measurement abilities for UTRA FDD
In this chapter the physical layer measurements reported to higher layers are
defined. The GSM measurements are required only from the GSM capable
terminals. The TDD measurements are required only from the terminals that are
capable to operate in TDD mode.

# 6 Measurements for UTRA FDD
## 6.1 UE measurements
### 6.1.1 Compressed mode
#### 6.1.1.1 Use of compressed mode for monitoring
On command from the UTRAN, a UE shall monitor cells on other FDD frequencies
and on other modes and radio access technologies that are supported by the UE
(i.e. TDD, GSM, E-UTRA). To allow the UE to perform measurements, UTRAN shall
command that the UE enters in compressed mode, depending on the UE
capabilities.
The UE capabilities define whether a UE requires compressed mode in order to
monitor cells on other FDD frequencies and on other modes and radio access
technologies. UE capabilities indicate the need for compressed mode separately
for the uplink and downlink and for each mode, radio access technology and
frequency band.
A UE shall support compressed mode for all cases for which the UE indicates
that compressed mode is required.
A UE does not need to support compressed mode for cases for which the UE
indicates that compressed mode is not required. For these cases, the UE shall
support an alternative means of making the measurements.
The UE shall support one single measurement purpose for one transmission gap
pattern sequence. The measurement purpose of the transmission gap pattern
sequence is signalled by higher layers.
The following subclause provides rules to parameterise the compressed mode.
#### 6.1.1.2 Parameterisation of the compressed mode
In response to a request from higher layers, the UTRAN shall signal to the UE
the compressed mode parameters.
A transmission gap pattern sequence consists of consecutive occurrences of
transmission gap pattern 1, where transmission gap pattern 1 consists of one
or two transmission gaps. See figure 1.
The following parameters characterise a transmission gap pattern:
\- TGSN (Transmission Gap Starting Slot Number): A transmission gap pattern
begins in a radio frame, henceforward called first radio frame of the
transmission gap pattern, containing at least one transmission gap slot. TGSN
is the slot number of the first transmission gap slot within the first radio
frame of the transmission gap pattern;
\- TGL1 (Transmission Gap Length 1): This is the duration of the first
transmission gap within the transmission gap pattern, expressed in number of
slots;
\- TGL2 (Transmission Gap Length 2): This is the duration of the second
transmission gap within the transmission gap pattern, expressed in number of
slots. If this parameter is not explicitly set by higher layers, then TGL2 =
TGL1;
\- TGD (Transmission Gap start Distance): This is the duration between the
starting slots of two consecutive transmission gaps within a transmission gap
pattern, expressed in number of slots. The resulting position of the second
transmission gap within its radio frame(s) shall comply with the limitations
of [2]. If this parameter is not set by higher layers, then there is only one
transmission gap in the transmission gap pattern;
\- TGPL1 (Transmission Gap Pattern Length): This is the duration of
transmission gap pattern 1, expressed in number of frames;
The following parameters control the transmission gap pattern sequence start
and repetition:
\- TGPRC (Transmission Gap Pattern Repetition Count): This is the number of
transmission gap patterns within the transmission gap pattern sequence;
\- TGCFN (Transmission Gap Connection Frame Number): This is the CFN of the
first radio frame of the first pattern 1 within the transmission gap pattern
sequence.
In addition to the parameters defining the positions of transmission gaps,
each transmission gap pattern sequence is characterised by:
\- UL/DL compressed mode selection: This parameter specifies whether
compressed mode is used in UL only, DL only or both UL and DL;
\- UL compressed mode method: The methods for generating the uplink compressed
mode gap are spreading factor division by two or higher layer scheduling and
are described in [2];
\- DL compressed mode method: The methods for generating the downlink
compressed mode gap are spreading factor division by two or higher layer
scheduling and are described in [2];
\- downlink frame type: This parameter defines if frame structure type \'A\'
or \'B\' shall be used in downlink compressed mode. The frame structures are
defined in [2];
\- scrambling code change: This parameter indicates whether the alternative
scrambling code is used for compressed mode method \'SF/2\'. Alternative
scrambling codes are described in [3];
\- RPP: Recovery Period Power control mode specifies the uplink power control
algorithm applied during recovery period after each transmission gap in
compressed mode. RPP can take 2 values (0 or 1). The different power control
modes are described in [4];
\- ITP: Initial Transmit Power mode selects the uplink power control method to
calculate the initial transmit power after the gap. ITP can take two values (0
or 1) and is described in [4].
The UE shall support simultaneous compressed mode pattern sequences which can
be used for different measurements. The following measurement purposes can be
signalled from higher layers:
> \- FDD
>
> \- TDD
>
> \- GSM carrier RSSI measurement
>
> \- Initial BSIC identification
>
> \- BSIC re-confirmation
>
> \- E-UTRA.
The UE shall support one compressed mode pattern sequence for each measurement
purpose while operating in FDD mode, assuming the UE needs compressed mode to
perform the respective measurement. In case the UE supports several of the
measurement purposes, it shall support in parallel one compressed mode pattern
sequence for each supported measurement purpose where the UE needs compressed
mode to perform the measurement. The capability of the UE to operate in
compressed mode in uplink and downlink is given from the UE capabilities.
The GSM measurements Initial BSIC identification and BSIC re-confirmation are
defined in [20].
Higher layers will ensure that the compressed mode gaps do not overlap and are
not scheduled to overlap the same frame. The behaviour when an overlap occurs
is described in [11]. UE is not required to support two compressed mode gaps
in a frame.
In all cases, higher layers have control of individual UE parameters. Any
pattern sequence can be stopped on higher layers\' command.
The parameters TGSN, TGL1, TGL2, TGD, TGPL1, TGPRC and TGCFN shall all be
integers.
