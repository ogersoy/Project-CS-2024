processing functions are identified. In this figure, the relevant Standards
for each function are also indicated.
In figure 1, the audio parts including analogue to digital and digital to
analogue conversion are included, to show the complete speech path between the
audio input/output in the Mobile Station (MS) and the digital interface of the
PSTN. The detailed specification of the audio parts are contained in GSM 03.50
[2]. These aspects are only considered to the extent that the performance of
the audio parts affect the performance of the speech transcoder.
An alternative and fully interoperable implementation using as a basis the
12.2 kbit/s mode of the Adaptive Multi Rate speech coder is described in
section 11.

# 5 Enhanced Full Rate speech channel transcoding
As shown in figure 1, the speech encoder takes its input as a 13‑bit uniform
Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) signal either from the audio part of the Mobile
Station or on the network side, from the Public Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN) via an 8‑bit/A‑law or μ-law (PCS 1900) to 13‑bit uniform PCM
conversion. The encoded speech at the output of the speech encoder is
delivered to the channel coding function defined in GSM 05.03 [3] to produce
an encoded block consisting of 456 bits leading to a gross bit rate of 22,8
kbit/s.
In the receive direction, the inverse operations take place. GSM 06.60 [6]
describes the detailed mapping between input blocks of 160 speech samples in
13‑bit uniform PCM format to encoded blocks of 244 bits and from encoded
blocks of 244 bits to output blocks of 160 reconstructed speech samples. The
sampling rate is 8 000 sample/s leading to a bit rate for the encoded bit
stream of 12,2 kbit/s. The coding scheme is the so‑called Algebraic Code
Excited Linear Prediction, hereafter referred to as ACELP.
GSM 06.60 [6] describes the codec and GSM 06.53 [4] defines the C code, thus
enabling the verification of compliance to GSM 06.60 [6] to a high degree of
confidence by use of a set of digital test sequences given in GSM 06.54 [5].
# 6 Enhanced Full Rate speech channel discontinuous transmission (DTX)
During a normal phone conversation, the participants alternate so that, on the
average, each direction of transmission is occupied about 50 % of the time.
Discontinuous transmission (DTX) is a mode of operation where the transmitters
are switched on only for those frames which contain useful information. This
may be done for the following two purposes:
1) In the MS, battery life will be prolonged or a smaller battery could be
used for a given operational duration.
2) The average interference level over the air interface is reduced, leading
to better Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum efficiency.
The overall DTX mechanism is implemented in the DTX handlers (Transmit (TX)
and Receive (RX)) described in GSM 06.81 [9] and requires the following
functions:
\- a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) on the TX side, see GSM 06.82 [10];
\- evaluation of the background acoustic noise on the TX side, in order to
transmit characteristic parameters to the RX side, see GSM 06.62 [8];
\- generation of comfort noise on the RX side during periods where the radio
transmission is turned off, see GSM 06.62 [8].
The transmission of comfort noise information to the RX side is achieved by
means of a Silence Descriptor (SID) frame. The SID frame is transmitted at the
end of speech bursts and serves as an end of speech marker for the RX side. In
order to update the comfort noise characteristics at the RX side, SID frames
are transmitted at regular intervals also during speech pauses. This also
serves the purpose of improving the measurement of the radio link quality by
the Radio SubSystem (RSS).
The DTX handlers interwork with the RSS using flags. The RSS is in control of
the actual transmitter keying on the TX side, and performs various
pre‑processing functions on the RX side. This is described in GSM 06.81 [9].
The speech flag (SP) indicates whether information bits are speech or SID
information. The SP flag is calculated from the VAD flag by the TX DTX
handler. When SID information is transmitted (SP=\"0\") the operation of the
speech encoder is modified to reduce the remaining computation for that frame.
This is described in GSM 06.62 [8].
# 7 Enhanced Full Rate speech channel Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
The Enhanced Full Rate VAD function is described in GSM 06.82 [10].
The input to the VAD is a set of parameters computed by the Enhanced Full Rate
speech encoder defined in GSM 06.60 [6]. The VAD uses this information to
decide whether each 20 ms speech coder frame contains speech or not. Note that
the VAD flag is an input to TX DTX handler and does not control the
transmitter keying directly.
GSM 06.82 [10] describes the VAD algorithm and GSM 06.53 [4] defines the C
code. The verification of compliance to GSM 06.82 [10] is achieved by use of
digital test sequences (see GSM 06.54 [5]) applied to the same interface as
the test sequences for the speech codec.
# 8 Enhanced Full Rate speech channel comfort noise insertion
The Enhanced Full Rate noise comfort insertion function is described in GSM
06.62 [8].
When switching the transmission on and off during DTX operation, the effect
would be a modulation of the background noise at the receiving end, if no
precautions were taken. When transmission is on, the background noise is
transmitted together with the speech to the receiving end. As the speech burst
ends, the connection is off and the perceived noise would drop to a very low
level. This step modulation of noise may be perceived as annoying and reduce
the intelligibility of speech, if presented to a listener without
modification.
This \"noise contrast effect\" is reduced in the GSM system by inserting an
artificial noise, termed comfort noise, at the receiving end when speech is
absent.
The comfort noise processes are as follows:
\- the evaluation of the acoustic background noise in the transmitter;
\- the noise parameter encoding (SID frames) and decoding;
\- and the generation of comfort noise in the receiver.
The comfort noise processes and the algorithm for updating the noise
parameters during speech pauses are defined in detail in GSM 06.62 [8].
The comfort noise mechanism is based on the Enhanced Full Rate speech codec
defined in GSM 06.60 [6].
# 9 Enhanced Full Rate speech channel lost speech frame substitution and
muting
The Enhanced Full Rate speech frame substitution and muting function is
described in GSM 06.61 [7].
In the receiver, frames may be lost due to transmission errors or frame
stealing. GSM 06.61 [7] describes the actions to be taken in these cases, both
for lost speech frames and for lost SID frames in DTX operation.
In order to mask the effect of an isolated lost frame, the lost speech frame
is substituted by a predicted frame based on previous frames. Insertion of
silence frames is not allowed. For several subsequent lost frames, a muting
technique shall be used to indicate to the listener that transmission has been
interrupted.
# 10 Enhanced Full Rate codec homing
The GSM Enhanced Full Rate speech transcoder, VAD, DTX system and comfort
noise parts of the audio processing functions (see figure 1) are defined in
bit exact arithmetic. Consequently, they shall react on a given input sequence
always with the corresponding bit exact output sequence, provided that the
internal state variables are also always exactly in the same state at the
beginning of the experiment.
The input test sequences provided in GSM 06.54 [5] shall force the
corresponding output test sequences, provided that the tested modules are in
their home‑state when starting.
The modules may be set into their home states by provoking the appropriate
homing‑functions.
NOTE: This is normally done during reset (initialization of the codec).
Special inband signalling frames (encoder‑homing‑frame and
decoder‑homing‑frame) described in GSM 06.60 [6] have been defined to provoke
these homing‑functions also in remotely placed modules.
This mechanism is specified to support three main areas:
\- type approval of mobile terminal equipment;
\- type approval of infrastructure equipment;
\- remote control and testing for operation and maintenance.
At the end of the first received homing frame, the audio functions that are
defined in a bit exact way shall go into their predefined home states. The
output corresponding to the first homing frame is dependent on the codec state
when the frame was received. Any consecutive homing frames shall produce
corresponding homing frames at the output.
# 11 Alternative Enhanced Full Rate implementation using the Adaptive Multi
Rate 12.2 kbit/s mode
The 12.2 kbit/s mode of the Adaptive Multi Rate speech coder described in TS
26.071 is functionally equivalent to the GSM Enhanced Full Rate speech coder.
An alternative implementation of the Enhanced Full Rate speech service based
on the 12.2 kbit/s mode of the Adaptive Multi Rate coder is allowed.
Alternative implementations shall implement the functionality specified in TS
26.071 for the 12.2 kbit/s mode, with the difference that the DTX transmission
format from GSM 06.81, the comfort noise generation from GSM 06.62 and the
decoder-homing-frame from GSM 06.60 shall be used.
Verification of compliance using the alternative implementation is achieved by
use of a set of digital test sequences given in GSM 06.54.
NOTE: The alternative implementation of the GSM Enhanced Full Rate speech
coder incurs an additional 5ms look-ahead delay, and the implementation in
this specification (GSM 06.51) is the preferred option.
