# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the measurement procedures for the conformance
test of the minimum performance requirements for FDD mode of UTRA user
equipment (UE) that supports Assisted Global Positioning System (A-GPS).
Tests are only applicable to those mobiles that are intended to support the
appropriate functionality. To indicate the circumstances in which tests apply,
this is noted in the \"_definition and applicability_ \" part of the test.
# 2 References
