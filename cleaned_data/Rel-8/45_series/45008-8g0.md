Abbreviations used in the present document are listed in 3GPP TR 21.905.
# 2 General
The radio sub‑system link control aspects that are addressed are as follows:
‑ Handover;
‑ RF Power control in _A/Gb mode_ , including fast power control for E-TCH and
enhanced power control for TCH and O-TCH;
‑ RF Power control in _Iu mode_ , including fast power control for E-TCH and
enhanced power control for DBPSCH (in MAC-Dedicated and MAC-DTM states);
‑ Radio link Failure;
‑ Cell selection and re‑selection in Idle mode, in Group Receive mode, in GPRS
mode and in broadcast/multicast receive mode (see 3GPP TS 43.022);
\- CTS mode tasks.
NOTE: A distinction is made between _A/Gb mode_ and _Iu mode_ only when
necessary. Procedures and mechanisms described in this TS apply to both modes
of operation unless otherwise stated. In _Iu mode_ , unless otherwise stated,
DBPSCH covers TCH, PDTCH and FLO.
Handover is required to maintain a call in progress as a MS engaged in a
point‑to‑point call or with access to the uplink of a channel used for a voice
group call passes from one cell coverage area to another and may also be
employed to meet network management requirements, e.g. relief of congestion.
Handover may occur during a call from one TCH or multiple TCHs (in the case of
multislot configuration) to another TCH or multiple TCHs. It may also occur
from DCCH to DCCH or from DCCH to one or multiple TCH(s), e.g. during the
initial signalling period at call set‑up. Additionally in _Iu mode_ , handover
may occur in MAC-Dedicated and MAC-DTM states:
‑ on PDTCH or multiple PDTCHs (in the case of multislot configuration) on
DBPSCH(s) to another PDTCH or multiple PDTCHs on DBPSCH(s);
‑ for FLO, from one DBPSCH or multiple DBPSCHs (in the case of multislot
configuration) to another DBPSCH or multiple DBPSCHs.
The handover may be either from channel(s) on one cell to other channel(s) on
a surrounding cell, or between channels on the same cell which are carried on
the same frequency band. Examples are given of handover strategies, however,
these will be determined in detail by the network operator.
For a multiband MS, the handover described is also allowed between any
channels on different cells which are carried on different frequency bands,
e.g. between a GSM 900/TCH and a DCS 1 800/TCH. Handover between two
co‑located cells, carried on different frequency bands, is considered as
inter‑cell handover irrespective of the handover procedures used.
For a multi-RAT MS, i.e. an MS supporting multiple radio access technologies,
handover is allowed between GSM and other radio access technologies.
NOTE: At handover, the MS will normally not be able to verify the PLMN of the
target cell and will thus assume that the same system information apply after
the handover unless the network provides new system information.
Adaptive control of the RF transmit power from an MS and optionally from the
BSS is implemented in order to optimize the uplink and downlink performance
and minimize the effects of co‑channel interference in the system.
The criteria for determining radio link failure are specified in order to
ensure that calls which fail either from loss of radio coverage or
unacceptable interference are satisfactorily handled by the network. Radio
link failure may result in either re‑establishment or release of the call in
progress. For channels used for a voice group call, an radio uplink failure
results in the freeing up of the uplink.
Procedures for cell selection and re‑selection whilst in Idle mode (i.e. not
actively processing a call), are specified in order to ensure that a mobile is
camped on a cell with which it can reliably communicate on both the radio
uplink and downlink. The operations of an MS in Idle Mode are specified in
3GPP TS 43.022.
Cell re-selection is also performed by the MS when attached to GPRS, except
when the MS simultaneously has a circuit switched connection. Optional
procedures are also specified for network controlled cell re-selection for
GPRS. Cell re-selection for GPRS is defined in subclause 10.1.
For a multi-RAT MS, cell selection and re-selection is allowed between GSM and
other radio access technologies.
An MS listening to a voice group call or a voice broadcast use cell
re‑selection procedures to change cell. This may be supported by a list of
cells carrying the voice group or voice broadcast call downlink, provided to
the MS by the network. The operations of an MS in Group Receive Mode are
specified in 3GPP TS 43.022.
Information signalled between the MS and BSS is summarized in tables 1, 2 and
3. A full specification of the Layer 1 header is given in 3GPP TS 44.004, of
the Layer 3 fields in 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.118, and of the Layer 2
fields in 3GPP TS 44.060 and 3GPP TS 44.160.
For CTS, information signalled between the CTS-MS and CTS-FP is summarized in
tables 4, 5 and 6. A full specification of the CTS Layer 3 fields is given in
3GPP TS 44.056.
For COMPACT, specific procedures are defined in clause 12.
During the reception of an MBMS session, the mobile station is in
broadcast/multicast receive mode. In this state, the MS performs autonomous
cell re-selection.
If the MS is a member of at least one Closed Subscriber Group, the MS may
perform cell re-selection to CSG cells.
# 3 Handover
## 3.1 Overall process
The overall handover process is implemented in the MS, BSS and MSC.
Measurement of radio subsystem downlink performance and signal levels received
from surrounding cells, is made in the MS. These measurements are signalled to
the BSS for assessment. The BSS measures the uplink performance for the MS
being served and also assesses the signal level of interference on its idle
traffic channels. Initial assessment of the measurements in conjunction with
defined thresholds and handover strategy may be performed in the BSS.
Assessment requiring measurement results from other BTS or other information
resident in the MSC, may be performed in the MSC.
3GPP TS 23.009 describes the handover procedures to be used in PLMNs.
## 3.2 MS measurement procedure
A procedure shall be implemented in the MS by which it monitors the downlink
RX signal level and quality from its serving cell and the downlink RX signal
level and BSIC of surrounding BTS. The method of identification of surrounding
BTS is described in subclause 7.2. The requirements for the MS measurements
are given in subclause 8.1.
## 3.3 BSS measurement procedure
A procedure shall be implemented in the BSS by which it monitors the uplink RX
signal level and quality from each MS being served by the cell. In the case of
a multislot configuration the evaluation shall be performed on a timeslot per
timeslot basis. A procedure shall be implemented by which the BSS monitors the
levels of interference on its idle traffic channels.
## 3.4 Strategy
The handover strategy employed by the network for radio link control
determines the handover decision that will be made based on the measurement
results reported by the MS/BSS and various parameters set for each cell.
Network directed handover may also occur for reasons other than radio link
control, e.g. to control traffic distribution between cells. The exact
handover strategies will be determined by the network operator, a detailed
example of a basic overall algorithm appears in annex A. Possible types of
handover are as follows:
Inter‑cell handover:
Intercell handover from the serving cell to a surrounding cell will normally
occur either when the handover measurements show low RXLEV and/or RXQUAL on
the current serving cell and a better RXLEV available from a surrounding cell,
or when a surrounding cell allows communication with a lower TX power level.
This typically indicates that an MS is on the border of the cell area.
Intercell handover may also occur from the DCCH on the serving cell to a TCH
or multislot configuration on another cell during call establishment. This may
be used as a means of providing successful call establishment when no suitable
TCH resource is available on the current serving cell.
Inter‑cell handover between cells using different frequency bands is allowed
for a multi band MS.
Inter‑cell handover between cells using different radio access technologies is
allowed for a multi-RAT MS.
Intra‑cell handover:
Intra‑cell handover from one channel/timeslot configuration in the serving
cell to another channel/timeslot configuration in the same cell will normally
be performed if the handover measurements show a low RXQUAL, but a high RXLEV
on the serving cell. This indicates a degradation of quality caused by
interference even though the MS is situated within the serving cell. The
intra‑cell handover should provide a channel with a lower level of
interference. Intra‑cell handover can occur either to a timeslot on a new
carrier or to a different timeslot on the same carrier. Similarly, intra‑cell
handover may occur between different multislot configurations in the same
cell. These multislot configurations may comprise different number of
timeslots and may partly overlap.
Intra-cell handover from one of the bands of operation to another one is
allowed for a multiband MS.
3GPP TS 48.008 defines the causes for handover that may be signalled from BSS
to MSC.
# 4 RF power control
## 4.1 Overall process
RF power control is employed to minimize the transmit power required by MS or
BSS whilst maintaining the quality of the radio links. By minimizing the
transmit power levels, interference to co‑channel users is reduced.
## 4.2 MS implementation
RF power control shall be implemented in the MS.
In _A/Gb mode_ , the power control level to be employed by the MS on each
uplink channel, except PDCH, is indicated by means of the power control
information sent either in the layer 1 header of each SACCH message block (see
3GPP TS 44.004) on the corresponding downlink channel, or in a dedicated
signalling block (see 3GPP TS 44.018). Power control for PDCH is defined in
subclause 10.2.
Similarly in _Iu mode_ in MAC-Dedicated state and MAC-DTM state, the power
control level to be employed by the MS on each uplink channel, is indicated by
means of the power control information sent either in the layer 1 header of
each SACCH message block (see 3GPP TS 44.004) on the corresponding downlink
channel, or in a dedicated signalling block (see 3GPP TS 44.118). Power
control for MAC-Shared state is defined in subclause 10.2.
The MS shall employ the most recently commanded power control level
appropriate to each channel for all transmitted bursts on either a TCH
(including handover access burst), FACCH, SACCH, PDTCH or SDCCH. For FLO in
_Iu mode_ the MS shall employ the most recently commanded power control level
appropriate to each DBPSCH for all transmitted bursts (including radio
packets, handover access burst and SACCH).
The MS shall confirm the power control level that it is currently employing in
the SACCH L1 header on each uplink channel. The indicated value shall be the
power control level actually used by the mobile for the last burst of the
previous SACCH period.
When on an E-TCH, the MS shall, if so indicated by the BSS in the SACCH L1
header (see 3GPP TS 44.004) or Assignment command (see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP
TS 44.118)), use FPC (fast power control). The MS shall employ the most
recently commanded fast power control level on each uplink E-TCH channel. The
power control level to be employed by the MS is indicated by means of the
power control information sent via E-IACCH once every FPC reporting period
(see subclause 4.7). If FPC is in use, the MS shall report, in the SACCH L1
header, the power control level used at the end of the normal power control
reporting period.
When on an E-TCH using 8 PSK for the uplink, the MS shall use the E-IACCH in
the uplink for fast measurement reporting.
In _A/Gb mode_ , when assigned a TCH or O-TCH, the MS shall configure the
channel in enhanced power control (EPC) mode if so commanded by BSS in the
channel assignment (see 3GPP TS 44.018). On such a channel, EPC may be used
for uplink power control and/or downlink power control.
Similarly in _Iu mode_ , when assigned a DBPSCH, the MS shall configure the
channel in enhanced power control (EPC) mode if so commanded by BSS in the
channel assignment (see 3GPP TS 44.118). On such a channel, EPC may be used
for uplink power control and/or downlink power control.
The enhanced power control (EPC) is part of the GERAN Feature Package 2 (see
3GPP TS 24.008).
When on a channel in EPC mode,
  * the MS shall use the EPCCH in the uplink for EPC measurement reporting (see subclause 8.4.1b).
  * the MS shall, depending on what is signalled in the L1 header of the downlink SACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.004) and during channel assignment (see 3GPP TS 44.018), obey either the EPC Uplink Power Control Command (sent on the EPCCH in the downlink) or the Ordered MS Power Level (sent in the L1 header of the downlink SACCH).
\- If the signalling indicates that EPC shall be used in the uplink, the MS
shall employ the most recently commanded EPC power control level, as indicated
by the EPC Uplink Power Control Command sent on the corresponding EPCCH in the
downlink. The EPC Uplink Power Control Command is sent once every EPC
reporting period (see subclause 8.4.1b). The MS shall ignore the Ordered MS
Power Level sent in the SACCH L1 header in the downlink.
\- If the signalling indicates that normal power control shall be used in the
uplink, the MS shall ignore the EPC Uplink Power Control Command and use
normal power control.
  * the MS shall confirm, in the SACCH L1 header on the uplink, the RF > power control level used at the last burst of the previous SACCH > period, as specified for normal power control.
NOTE: The term \"normal power control\" is used in this specification only for
clarification and is otherwise only referred to as \"power control\".
In case of a multislot configuration, each bi‑directional channel shall be
power controlled individually by the corresponding SACCH, E-IACCH or EPCCH,
whichever is applicable. Power control information on downlink unidirectional
channels shall be neglected.
When accessing a cell on the RACH (random access) and before receiving the
first power command during a communication on a DCCH or TCH (after an
IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT), on DCS 1800 and PCS 1900 frequency bands the MS shall
use the power level defined by the MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH parameter broadcast on the
BCCH of the cell. On all other bands the MS shall limit the power level to
LB_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH + Band_offset, if LB_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH parameter is
broadcast, otherwise the power level is limited according to the
MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH parameter. Band_offset equals 0 dB for GSM 850 and GSM 900,
-2 dB for GSM 700 and -6 dB for GSM 400. As an exception, on the DCS 1800 band
the class 3 DCS 1 800 capable MS shall use the power level defined by
MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH plus the value POWER_OFFSET also broadcast on the BCCH of the
cell.
If a power control level defined in 3GPP TS 45.005 is received but the level
is not supported by the MS, the MS shall use the supported output power which
is closest to the output power indicated by the received power control level.
## 4.3 MS power control range
The range over which a MS shall be capable of varying its RF output power
shall be from its maximum output down to its minimum, in steps of nominally 2
dB.
3GPP TS 45.005 gives a detailed definition of the RF power level step size and
tolerances.
In _A/Gb mode,_ the fast power control scheme for E-TCH and the enhanced power
control scheme for TCH and O-TCH are based on differential control to adjust
the employed RF power level. Similarly in _Iu mode_ , the fast power control
scheme for E-TCH and the enhanced power control scheme for DBPSCH are also
based on differential control to adjust the employed RF power level. The
possible DL power control commands are listed in the following table.
* * *
Codeword Power control command 0 Not used 1 Increase output power by four
power control levels 2 Increase output power by three power control levels 3
Increase output power by two power control levels 4 Increase output power by
one power control level 5 No output power level change 6 Decrease output power
by one power control level 7 Decrease output power by two power control levels
* * *
If a power control command is received but the requested output power is not
supported by the MS, the MS shall use the supported output power which is
closest to the requested output power.
## 4.4 BSS implementation
In _A/Gb mode_ , RF power control, including fast power control for E-TCH and
enhanced power control for TCH and O-TCH, may optionally be implemented in the
BSS.
Similarly in _Iu mode_ , RF power control, including fast power control for
E-TCH and enhanced power control for DBPSCH, may optionally be implemented in
the BSS.
## 4.5 BSS power control range
The range over which the BSS shall be capable of reducing its RF output power
from its maximum level shall be nominally 30 dB, in 15 steps of nominally 2
dB.
3GPP TS 45.005 gives a detailed definition of the RF power level step size and
tolerances.
## 4.6 Strategy
The RF power control strategy employed by the network determines the ordered
power level that is signalled to the MS, and the power level that is employed
by the BSS.
The power level to be employed in each case will be based on the measurement
results reported by the MS/BTS and various parameters set for each cell. The
exact strategies will be determined by the network operator. A detailed
example of a basic algorithm appears in annex A.
## 4.7 Timing
### 4.7.1 Normal Power Control
Upon receipt of a command from an SACCH to change its power level on the
corresponding uplink channel, the MS shall change to the new level at a rate
of one nominal 2 dB power control step every 60 ms (13 TDMA frames), i.e. a
range change of 15 steps should take about 900 ms. The change shall commence
at the first TDMA frame belonging to the next reporting period (as specified
in subclause 8.4). The MS shall change the power one nominal 2 dB step at a
time, at a rate of one step every 60 ms following the initial change,
irrespective of whether actual transmission takes place or not.
In case of channel change, except for multislot configuration change, the
commanded power control level shall be applied on each new channel
immediately. The multislot configuration change message does not command the
MS to use new power control levels. For those time slots not used by the MS
before the multislot configuration change procedure, the MS shall use the
power control level used on the main channel before the multislot
configuration change.
### 4.7.2 Fast Power Control
Switching between the normal power control mechanism and FPC shall be done if
FPC is enabled or disabled via signalling in the SACCH L1 header. The
respective power control mechanism to be used shall then be active as from the
first TDMA frame belonging to the next reporting period (see subclause 8.4).
The initial power control level to be used by the MS immediately after
switching shall, in both cases, be the level last commanded by the normal
power control mechanism.
The basic timing cycle for the fast power control mechanism is the FPC
reporting period of length 4 TDMA frames, which is mapped into the
26-multiframe according to the following figure.
DL measurements made during RP(n) shall be reported to the network during the
next occurance of RP((n+2) mod 6). Power control commands received from the
network during RP(n) are effectuated on the corresponding UL channel during
the next occurance of RP((n+1) mod 6).
### 4.7.3 Enhanced Power Control
When in enhanced power control (EPC) mode, the MS shall for uplink power
control obey either the EPC Uplink Power Control Commands or the Ordered MS
Power Level. This is controlled by signalling via the SACCH L1 header in the
downlink (see 3GPP TS 44.004) and during channel assignment (see 3GPP TS
44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.118). The type of power control commands to be obeyed by
the MS during one SACCH period is determined by what is signalled in the L1
header during the previous SACCH period and, before any SACCH block has been
correctly decoded, by what is signalled during channel assignment.
> NOTE: This signalling via the SACCH L1 header and during channel assignment
> only controls the uplink power control mechanism. In _A/Gb mode_ , EPC
> measurement procedures shall always be followed by the MS when on a TCH or
> O-TCH in EPC mode. Similarly in _Iu mode_ , EPC measurement procedures shall
> always be followed by the MS when on a DBPSCH in EPC mode.
When the MS is ordered to obey the Ordered MS Power Level, the timing
according to subclause 4.7.1 applies.
When the MS is ordered to obey the EPC Uplink Power Control Command, it shall,
upon receipt of an EPC Uplink Power Control Command on an EPCCH in the
downlink, change to the new power level on the corresponding uplink channel at
the first TDMA frame belonging to the next EPC reporting period (as specified
in subclause 8.4.1b).
## 4.8 Dedicated channels used for a voice group call or voice broadcast
The network shall not allocate the uplink of the channel used for a voice
group call to more than one MS. If marked busy, no other MS shall transmit on
the channel. This marking is indicated by the network, as defined in 3GPP TS
43.068 and 3GPP TS 44.018. Any MS allocated the uplink of a channel used for a
voice group call shall only transmit if the uplink is marked busy, and shall
stop using the uplink if it happens to become marked free. An MS not allocated
the uplink may perform a random access procedure on the uplink to gain access
to talk, only if the uplink is marked as free.
On a channel used during a voice group call, the uplink power control shall
only apply to the MS currently allocated that uplink, and the MS power control
level ordered by the network shall be ignored by all other MSs listening to
the downlink.
When performing a random access on a cell to gain access to the uplink of a
channel used for a voice group call, until receiving the first dedicated power
command from the network, the MS shall use the last received power level
command as defined by the MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH parameter broadcast on the BCCH of
the cell, or if MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH corresponds to a power control level not
supported by the MS as defined by its power class in 3GPP TS 45.005, the MS
shall act as though the closest supported power control level had been
broadcast.
RF downlink power control will normally not be applied on channels used for a
voice group call or voice broadcast.
# 5 Radio link failure
## 5.1 Criterion
The criterion for determining Radio Link Failure in the MS shall be based on
the success rate of decoding messages on the downlink SACCH. In _A/Gb mode_ ,
for a circuit switched multislot configuration, only the main SACCH shall be
used for determining Radio Link Failure. Similarly in _Iu mode_ , for a
multislot configuration in MAC-Dedicated State or MAC-DTM State, only the main
SACCH shall be used for determining Radio Link Failure.
For packet transfer mode in _A/Gb mode_ , Radio Link Failure is determined by
the RLC/MAC protocol (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
For _Iu mode_ in MAC-Shared State, Radio Link Failure is determined by the
RLC/MAC protocol (see 3GPP TS 44.160).
## 5.2 MS procedure
The aim of determining radio link failure in the MS is to ensure that calls
with unacceptable voice/data quality, which cannot be improved either by RF
power control or handover, are either re‑established or released in a defined
manner. In general the parameters that control the forced release should be
set such that the forced release will not normally occur until the call has
degraded to a quality below that at which the majority of subscribers would
have manually released. This ensures that, for example, a call on the edge of
a radio coverage area, although of bad quality, can usually be completed if
the subscriber wishes.
The radio link failure criterion is based on the radio link counter S. If the
MS is unable to decode a SACCH message (BFI = 1),S is decreased by 1. In the
case of a successful reception of a SACCH message (BFI = 0) S is increased by
2. In any case S shall not exceed the value of RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT. If S
reaches 0 a radio link failure shall be declared. The action to be taken is
specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.118 (_Iu mode_). The
RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT parameter is transmitted by each BSS in the BCCH data (see
table 1).
The MS shall continue transmitting as normal on the uplink until S reaches 0.
The algorithm shall start after the assignment of a dedicated channel and S
shall be initialized to RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT.
The detailed operation shall be as follows:
\- the radio link time‑out algorithm shall be stopped at the reception of a
channel change command;
\- (re‑)initialization and start of the algorithm shall be done whenever the
MS switches to a new dedicated channel (this includes the old channel in
assignment and handover failure cases), at the latest in _A/Gb mode_ when the
main signalling link (see 3GPP TS 44.018) has been established or in _Iu mode_
immediately after the MS is ready to receive (see 3GPP TS 44.118, 3GPP TS
45.010);
\- the RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT value used at (re‑)initialization shall be that used
on the previous channel (in the Immediate Assignment case the value received
on the BCCH), or the value received on SACCH if the MS has received a
RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT value on the new channel before the initialization;
\- if the first RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT value on the SACCH is received on the new
channel after the initialization, the counter shall be re‑initialized with the
new value.
An MS listening to a voice group call or a voice broadcast, upon a downlink
radio link failure shall return to idle mode and perform cell re‑selection.
## 5.3 BSS procedure
The criteria for determining radio link failure in the BSS should be based
upon either the error rate on the uplink SACCH(s) or on RXLEV/RXQUAL
measurements of the MS. The exact criteria to be employed shall be determined
by the network operator.
For channels used for a voice group call, the radio link failure procedures in
the BSS shall be reset upon the re‑allocation of the uplink to another MS.
Upon a uplink radio failure, the network shall mark it as free, see subclause
4.8.
Whenever the uplink is not used, and for channels used for voice broadcast,
the BSS radio link failure procedures shall not apply on that channel.
# 6 Idle mode tasks
## 6.1 Introduction
Whilst in idle mode, an MS shall implement the cell selection and re‑selection
procedures described in 3GPP TS 43.022. These procedures make use of
measurements and sub‑procedures described in this subclause.
The procedures ensure that the MS is camped on a cell from which it can
reliably decode downlink data and with which it has a high probability of
communications on the uplink. Once the MS is camped on a cell, access to the
network is allowed.
At cell selection, before accessing the network, the MS shall decode all
information about dynamic mapping of ARFCN numbers, if used by the network. As
an exception, a single access attempt (including repetitions allowed for
channel request) is allowed using stored information that has been received
from the same PLMN within last 24 hours. Alternatively a single access attempt
is allowed using stored information, received from the same PLMN, without
decoding all SI 15 instances if the Dynamic ARFCN Mapping change mark (See
3GPP TS 44.018) in the stored information is equal to that decoded from any of
SI 15 instances. The MS shall always use the most recent information about
Dynamic ARFCN Mapping.
This clause makes use of terms defined in 3GPP TS 43.022.
The MS shall not use the discontinuous reception (DRX) mode of operation (i.e.
powering itself down when it is not expecting paging messages from the
network) while performing the cell selection algorithm defined in 3GPP TS
43.022. However use of powering down is permitted at all other times in idle
mode.
For the purpose of cell selection and reselection, the MS shall be capable of
detecting and synchronizing to a BCCH carrier and read the BCCH data at
reference sensitivity level and reference interference levels as specified in
3GPP TS 45.005. An MS in idle mode shall always fulfil the performance
requirement specified in 3GPP TS 45.005 at levels down to reference
sensitivity level or reference interference level. The allowed error rates
(see 3GPP TS 45.005) might impact the cell selection and reselection
procedure, e.g. trigger cell reselection. Moreover, one consequence of the
allowed error rates is that in the case of no frequency hopping and a TU3 (TU6
for GSM 400, TU3.6 for GSM 700, TU1.5 for DCS 1 800 and PCS 1 900) propagation
profile it can not be expected that an MS will respond to paging unless the
received signal level is 2 dB higher than the specified reference level.
For the purposes of cell selection and reselection, the MS is required to
maintain an average of received signal levels for all monitored frequencies.
These quantities termed the \"received level averages\" (RLA_C), shall be
unweighted averages of the received signal levels measured in dBm. The
accuracy of the received signal level measurements for idle mode tasks shall
be the same as for radio link measurements (see subclause 8.1.2).
If the MS camps on a suitable cell as a result of a cell change order from
E-UTRAN (see 3GPP TS 36.331), system information of the cell may be provided
by the network in E-UTRAN. In this case, the MS may omit to acquire the system
information from the BCCH of the GERAN cell before establishing a circuit
switched connection if the conditions specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 are met.
The times given in subclauses 6.2, 6.3 and 6.6 refer to internal processes in
the MS required to ensure that the MS camps as quickly as possible to the most
appropriate cell.
For the cell selection, the MS shall be able to select the correct (fourth
strongest) cell and be able to respond to paging on that cell within 30
seconds of switch on, when the three strongest cells are not suitable. This
assumes a valid SIM with PIN disabled and ideal radio conditions. This
requirement is not applicable for multi-RAT mobile stations.
NOTE: Priorities between different frequencies or RATs provided to the MS by
system information or by dedicated signalling are not used in the cell
selection process.
The tolerance on all the timing requirements in clause 6 is ± 10 %, except for
PENALTY_TIME where it is ± 2 s.
## 6.2 Measurements for normal cell selection
The measurements of this clause shall be performed by an MS which has no prior
knowledge of which RF channels are BCCH carriers.
The MS shall search all RF channels within its bands of operation, take
readings of received RF signal level on each RF channel, and calculate the
RLA_C for each. The averaging is based on at least five measurement samples
per RF carrier spread over 3 to 5 s, the measurement samples from the
different RF carriers being spread evenly during this period.
A multi band MS shall search all channels within its bands of operation as
specified above. The number of channels searched will be the sum of channels
on each band of operation.
BCCH carriers can be identified by, for example, searching for frequency
correction bursts. On finding a BCCH carrier, the MS shall attempt to
synchronize to it and read the BCCH data.
The maximum time allowed for synchronization to a BCCH carrier is 0.5 s, and
the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data, when being synchronized to a
BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s or equal to the scheduling period for the BCCH data,
whichever is greater (see 3GPP TS 45.002). The MS is allowed to camp on a cell
and access the cell after decoding all relevant BCCH data.
## 6.3 Measurements for stored list cell selection
The MS may include optional storage of BCCH carrier information when switched
off as detailed in 3GPP TS 43.022. For example, the MS may store the BCCH
carriers in use by the PLMN selected when it was last active in the network.
The BCCH list may include BCCH carriers from more than one band in a multi
band operation PLMN. A MS may also store BCCH carriers for more than one PLMN
which it has selected previously (e.g. at national borders or when more than
one PLMN serves a country), in which case the BCCH carrier lists must be kept
quite separate.
The stored BCCH carrier information used by the MS may be derived by a variety
of different methods. The MS may use the BA_RANGE information element, which,
if transmitted in the channel release message (see 3GPP TS 44.018), indicates
ranges of carriers which include the BCCH carriers in use over a wide area or
even the whole PLMN. It should be noted that the BA(BCCH) list might only
contain carriers in use in the vicinity of the cell on which it was broadcast,
and therefore might not be appropriate if the MS is switched off and moved to
a new location.
The BA_RANGE information element contains the Number of Ranges parameter
(defined as NR) as well as NR sets of parameters RANGEi_LOWER and
RANGEi_HIGHER. The MS should interpret these to mean that all the BCCH
carriers of the network have ARFCNs in the following ranges:
Range _1_ = ARFCN(RANGE _1_ _LOWER) to ARFCN(RANGE _1_ _HIGHER);\ Range _2_ =
ARFCN(RANGE _2_ _LOWER) to ARFCN(RANGE _2_ _HIGHER);\ Range _NR_ = ARFCN(RANGE
_NR_ _LOWER) to ARFCN(RANGE _NR_ _HIGHER).
If RANGEi_LOWER is greater than RANGEi_HIGHER, the range shall be considered
cyclic and encompasses carriers with ARFCN from range RANGEi_LOWER to 1 023
and from 0 to RANGEi_HIGHER. If RANGEi_LOWER equals RANGEi_HIGHER then the
range shall only consist of the carrier whose ARFCN is RANGEi_LOWER.
If an MS includes a stored BCCH carrier list of the selected PLMN it shall
perform the same measurements as in subclause 6.2 except that only the BCCH
carriers in the list need to be measured.
NOTE: If the selected PLMN is equal to one of the equivalent PLMNs, then
stored list cell selection applies to all equivalent PLMNs.
If stored list cell selection is not successful, then as defined in 3GPP TS
43.022, normal cell selection shall take place. Since information concerning a
number of channels is already known to the MS, it may assign high priority to
measurements on the strongest carriers from which it has not previously made
attempts to obtain BCCH information, and omit repeated measurements on the
known ones.
## 6.4 Criteria for cell selection and reselection
The path loss criterion parameter C1 used for cell selection and reselection
is defined by:
C1 = (A ‑ Max(B,0))
where
A = RLA_C ‑ RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN\ B = MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH ‑ P
except for the class 3 DCS 1 800 MS where:
B = MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH + POWER OFFSET ‑ P\ RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN = Minimum received
signal level at the MS required for access to the system.\ MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH =
Maximum TX power level an MS may use when accessing the system until otherwise
commanded.
POWER OFFSET = The power offset to be used in conjunction with the MS TXPWR\
MAX CCH parameter by the class 3 DCS 1 800 MS.\ P = Maximum RF output power of
the MS.
All values are expressed in dBm.
The path loss criterion (3GPP TS 43.022) is satisfied if C1 > 0.
The reselection criterion C2 is used for cell reselection only and is defined
by:
C2 = C1 + CELL_RESELECT_OFFSET ‑ TEMPORARY_OFFSET * H(PENALTY_TIME ‑ T) for\
PENALTY_TIME \<> 11111\ C2 = C1 ‑ CELL_RESELECT_OFFSET for PENALTY_TIME =
11111
where
For non‑serving cells:
H(x) = 0 for x \ \- the cell with the highest value of C2 + LSA_OFFSET among those cells that
> have highest LSA priority among those that fulfil the criteria C4 ≥ 0, or
>
> \- the cell with the highest value of C2 among all cells, if no cell fulfil
> the criterion C4 ≥ 0.
>
> LSA_OFFSET is broadcast on BCCH. If no LSA_OFFSET parameter is broadcast,
> LSA_OFFSET shall be set to 0.
>
> LSA priority is defined by the list of LSAs for the subscriber stored on the
> SIM (see 3GPP TS 51.011). LSAs are identified by LSA ID(s), Cell Identity
> and/or Location Area Identity broadcast on BCCH. Cells not belonging to this
> list are given LSA priority lower than 0.
>
> When evaluating the best cell, the following hysteresis values shall be
> subtracted from the C2 value for the neighbour cells:
\- if the new cell is in the same location area: 0;
\- if the new cell is in a different location area:\ CELL_RESELECT_HYSTERESIS,
which is broadcast on BCCH of the serving cell.
\- in case of a cell reselection occurred within the previous 15 seconds: 5
dB.
Cell reselection for any other reason (see 3GPP TS 43.022) shall take place
immediately, but the cell that the MS was camped on shall not be returned to
within 5 seconds if another suitable cell can be found. If valid receive level
averages are not available, the MS shall wait until these values are available
and then perform the cell reselection if it is still required. The MS may
accelerate the measurement procedure within the requirements in subclause
6.6.1 to minimise the cell reselection delay.
If no suitable cell is found within 10 seconds, the cell selection algorithm
of 3GPP TS 43.022 shall be performed. Since information concerning a number of
channels is already known to the MS, it may assign high priority to
measurements on the strongest carriers from which it has not previously made
attempts to obtain BCCH information, and omit repeated measurements on the
known ones.
### 6.6.4 Measurements on cells of other radio access technologies
For a multi-RAT MS, cells or frequencies with other radio access technologies
(excluding E-UTRA) may be included in 3G Cell Reselection list (see 3GPP TS
44.018). If cell reselection based on ranking is used, the network controls
the measurements for reselection of these cells by the parameter Qsearch_I
broadcast on BCCH. Qsearch_I defines a threshold and also indicates whether
these measurements shall be performed when RLA_C (see subclause 6.6.1) of the
serving cell is below or above the threshold. These measurements may be
performed less frequently than measurements of GSM cells as described in
subclause 6.6.1, in order to conserve MS power.
For a multi-RAT MS supporting E-UTRA, E-UTRAN frequencies may be included in
the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list (see 3GPP TS 44.018). The network controls the
measurements for reselection of E-UTRA cells by the parameter
THRESH_priority_search broadcast on BCCH. This parameter also controls
measurement of inter-RAT cells or frequencies included in the 3G Cell
Reselection list when the inter-RAT cell reselection algorithm based on
priority information is used (see subclause 6.6.6). The mobile station shall
monitor cells of inter-RAT frequencies of higher priority than the serving
cell. When RLA_C of the serving cell is below THRESH_priority_search, the
mobile station shall monitor cells of inter-RAT frequencies of lower priority
than the serving cell. When RLA_C (see subclause 6.6.1) of the serving cell is
above the threshold, the mobile station is allowed not to monitor cells of
inter-RAT frequencies of lower priority than the serving cell.
The MS shall perform the measurement processes for E-UTRAN and other access
technologies in parallel when applicable.
A UTRAN capable MS shall be able to identify and select a new best UTRAN cell
on a frequency, which is part of the 3G Cell Reselection list, within 30
seconds (in case of cell reselection based on cell ranking) or
25+T_reselection seconds (in case of cell reselection based on priority
information, if the UTRAN frequency has lower priority than the serving cell
and if RLA_C of the serving cell is below THRESH_priority_search) after it has
been activated under the condition that there is only one UTRAN frequency in
the list (and no E-UTRAN frequencies in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list) and
that no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good radio
conditions. As an exception, the time is increased to 70+T_reselection seconds
in case of a UTRAN capable MS performing cell reselection based on priority
information (see subclause 6.6.6) if the UTRAN frequency has higher priority
than the serving cell. A E-UTRAN capable MS shall be able to identify and
select a new best E-UTRAN cell on a frequency, which is part of the E-UTRAN
Neighbour Cell list, within 25+T_reselection seconds after it has been
activated if the frequency has lower priority than the serving cell and if
RLA_C of the serving cell is below THRESH_priority_search, or within
70+T_reselection seconds after it has been activated if the frequency has
higher priority than the serving cell, under the condition that there is only
one E-UTRAN frequency in the list (and no UTRAN frequencies in the 3G Cell
Reselection list) and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and
under good radio conditions. For test purposes the following radio conditions
can be used: Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours at
RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then either an UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an UTRAN TDD
neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN TDD neighbour
cell is switched on. The radio conditions for the UTRAN FDD cell are as
follows (see 3GPP TS 25.101 for definitions):

NOTE: The parameters in the table above are valid only for cell reselection
based on cell ranking.
The radio conditions for the UTRAN TDD cell (either 3.84 Mcps TDD option or
1.28 Mcps TDD option) are as follows (see 3GPP TS 25.123 for definitions and
for the values of the remaining configuration parameters):

* * *
The allowed time is increased
\- by 30 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency in the 3G Cell
Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on ranking is used, or
\- by 30 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of lower priority in the
3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on priority
information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency of lower priority
in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list under the condition that RLA_C of the
serving cell is below THRESH_priority_search, or
\- by 70 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of higher priority in the
3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on priority
information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency of higher
priority in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.
However, multiple UTRAN cells on the same frequency in the 3G Cell Reselection
list does not increase the allowed time.
NOTE: The requirements above assume that only one of the frequencies in the 3G
Cell Reselection list or in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list is switched on.
A multi-RAT MS shall be able to monitor cells from other radio access
technologies, divided into (depending on the MS capability):
\- UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD frequencies, with a maximum of 32 cells per
frequency; and/or\ \- UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies with a
maximum of 32 cells per frequency; and/or\ \- E-UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD
frequencies; and/or\ \- E-UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies.
The total number of monitored UTRAN cells shall not exceed 64.
The MS shall attempt to read and store UTRAN predefined configurations using
the rules defined in 3GPP TS 25.331 with the following exceptions:
\- The MS shall build a list of at most 16 predefined configurations, read
from the BCCH of the identified UTRAN cells of equivalent PLMNs.
\- After PLMN selection (see 3GPP TS 23.122), the MS shall delete any old list
of predefined configurations and as soon as possible attempt to read the
predefined configurations from one identified UTRAN cell of the selected PLMN
or of an equivalent PLMN.
\- The MS shall attempt to update the list of predefined configurations every
60 minutes.
In case of a conflict with GSM tasks, the GSM tasks take precedence.
NOTE: Instead of reading new predefined configurations from a PLMN, the MS may
use previously received predefined configurations for that PLMN according to
the rules in 3GPP TS 25.331.
The MS shall report the list of predefined configurations in the UTRAN
CLASSMARK CHANGE message (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
If the MS has no or an empty \"Allowed CSG list\" and information about
PSC/PCI split information for UTRAN/EUTRAN frequencies is available, the MS
shall disable the measurement of the cells on the frequencies with PSC/PCI in
the stored range \"CSG PSC/PCI Split Information\".
If the MS has no or an empty \"Allowed CSG list\" and information about
dedicated frequencies for UTRAN/EUTRAN is available, the MS shall disable the
measurement for cells on dedicated CSG frequencies.
### 6.6.5 Algorithm for cell re‑selection from GSM to UTRAN based on cell
ranking
The algorithm in this subclause shall be used for reselection from GSM to
UTRAN if the conditions for the use of the cell reselection algorithm based on
priority information (see subclause 6.6.6) are not satisfied.
If the 3G Cell Reselection list includes UTRAN frequencies, the MS shall, at
least every 5 s update the value RLA_C for the serving cell and each of the at
least 6 strongest non serving GSM cells.
The MS shall then reselect a suitable (see 3GPP TS 25.304) UTRAN cell if:
\- for a TDD cell the measured RSCP value is equal to or greater than
TDD_Qoffset for a period of 5 s and
\- for an FDD cell the following criteria are all met for a period of 5 s:
  1. its measured RSCP value exceeds the value of RLA_C for the serving cell and all of the suitable (see 3GPP TS 43.022) non-serving GSM cells by the value FDD_Qoffset,
  2. its measured Ec/No value is equal or greater than the value FDD_Qmin - FDD_Qmin_Offset, and
  3. its measured RSCP value is equal to or greater than FDD_RSCP_threshold.
In case of a cell reselection occurring within the previous 15 seconds,
FDD_Qoffset or TDD_Qoffset is increased by 5 dB.
> \- Ec/No and RSCP are the measured quantities, see subclause 8.1.5.
  * FDD_RSCP_threshold equals FDD_RSCPmin -- min((P_MAX -- 21 dBm), 3 dB) if FDD_RSCPmin is broadcast on the serving cell, else Qrxlevmin + Pcompensation + 10 dB, if these parameters are available, otherwise the default value of FDD_RSCPmin.
  * Qrxlevmin is the minimum required RX level in the UTRAN FDD cell (dBm), see 3GPP TS 25.304.
  * Pcompensation is max(UE_TXPWR_MAX_RACH -- P_MAX, 0) (dB), see 3GPP TS 25.304.
  * UE_TXPWR_MAX_RACH is the maximum TX power level an MS may use when accessing the UTRAN FDD cell on RACH (dBm), see 3GPP TS 25.304.
  * P_MAX is the maximum RF output power of the MS (dBm) in UTRAN FDD mode, see 3GPP TS 25.304.
```{=html}
``` \- FDD_Qmin, FDD_Qoffset and optionally FDD_RSCPmin and FDD_Qmin_Offset
are broadcast on BCCH of the serving cell.
  * TDD_Qoffset is broadcast on BCCH of the serving cell.
Note 1: The parameters required to determine if the UTRAN cell is suitable are
broadcast on BCCH of the UTRAN cell. An MS may start reselection towards the
UTRAN cell before decoding the BCCH of the UTRAN cell, leading to a short
interruption of service if the UTRAN cell is not suitable.
Note 2: If FDD_RSCPmin is broadcast, optimum GSM to UTRAN reselection
performance is achieved if UTRAN cells at UTRAN coverage border areas are
planned for +24 dBm UE power.
Note 3: The parameter TDD_Qoffset is an absolute threshold for reselection
towards a target UTRAN TDD cell.
The MS shall store the UTRAN cell RSCP suitability criterion parameters above,
whenever decoded from a UTRAN FDD cell, which is not a CSG cell, of a PLMN
which is the registered PLMN or is in the stored list of equivalent PLMNs (see
3GPP TS 24.008) while attempting to camp on the UTRAN FDD cell. The mobile
station should store, along with decoded RSCP suitability parameters, the
frequency of the cell from which they were decoded. The most recently stored
parameters from one UTRAN FDD cell (other than, in the case of an MS with at
least one CSG ID in its CSG Whitelist, a CSG cell) of an equivalent PLMN and
(if different) the most recently stored parameters from a UTRAN FDD cell
(other than a CSG cell) of an equivalent PLMN (including the registered PLMN)
operating on the same frequency as the candidate cell are valid reselection
criteria towards any candidate UTRAN FDD cell evaluated using the algorithm in
this sub-clause. The mobile station should use only stored parameters from a
UTRAN FDD cell (other than a CSG cell) of an equivalent PLMN operating on the
same frequency as the candidate cell when evaluating a candidate cell. This
list of parameters shall be cleared after PLMN selection (see 3GPP TS 23.122).
Cell reselection to UTRAN shall not occur within 5 seconds after the MS has
reselected a GSM cell from an UTRAN cell if a suitable GSM cell can be found.
In case of a reselection attempt towards a barred UTRAN cell, the MS shall
abandon further reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell as defined by the
T~barred~ value on the barred UTRAN cell (see 3GPP TS 25.331).
In case the highest ranked UTRAN cell is not suitable (see 3GPP TS 25.304) due
to being part of the \"list of forbidden LAs for roaming\" or belonging to a
PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN, the MS
may abandon further reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell and all other
cells on the same frequency, for a period of up to 20 min. If the MS has to
perform cell selection, this limitation shall be removed. If the MS is
redirected under GERAN control to a frequency for which the timer is running,
any limitation on that frequency shall be removed.
If more than one UTRAN cell fulfils the above criteria, the MS shall select
the cell with the greatest RSCP value.
### 6.6.6 Algorithm for inter-RAT cell re-selection based on priority
information
A mobile station supporting E-UTRAN shall support priority based inter-RAT
cell re-selection towards all the supported RATs. A mobile station not
supporting E-UTRAN and supporting UTRAN and supporting priority based
reselection from UTRAN to GERAN (see 3GPP TS 25.306) shall support priority
based inter-RAT cell re-selection towards UTRAN.
The algorithm in this sub-clause shall be used for inter-RAT cell reselection
if the following conditions are satisfied:
\- the mobile station supports priority based inter-RAT cell re-selection, and
\- the mobile station has received the Serving Cell Priority Parameters
Description IE (see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060) for the serving cell.
If one or both of these conditions are not met, then inter-RAT reselection to
E-UTRAN cells is not permitted, and inter-RAT reselection to UTRAN cells shall
use the algorithm specified in sub-clause 6.6.5.
The set of valid priorities to be used for this algorithm is specified in 3GPP
TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060. Cells belonging to frequencies for which no
priority is available or no threshold is provided by the serving cell shall
not be considered for measurement and for cell re-selection.
NOTE 1: The network may enable priority based reselection by providing in the
serving cell at least the Serving Cell Priority Parameters Description struct
and priority information (threshold and priority) for each inter-RAT frequency
included in the neighbour cell list to which the possibility of reselection by
a mobile station using this algorithm is desired (whether or not such cells
support priority-based reselection).
NOTE 2: Throughout the specification, the phrase "neighbour cell list" will
include also the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list where appropriate.
NOTE 3: void
If the 3G Cell Reselection list or the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list include
frequencies of other radio access technologies, the MS shall, at least every 5
s update the value RLA_C for the serving cell and each of the at least 6
strongest non serving GSM cells.
The MS shall then reselect a suitable (see 3GPP TS 25.304 for UTRAN and 3GPP
TS 36.304 for E-UTRAN) cell of another radio access technology if the criteria
below are satisfied. S_non-serving_XXX is the measurement quantity of a non-
serving inter-RAT cell and XXX indicates the other radio access
technology/mode and is defined as follows:
\- for a UTRAN cell, is the measured RSCP value for the cell minus
UTRAN_QRXLEVMIN for the cell's frequency;
\- for a E-UTRAN cell, is the measured RSRP value for the cell minus
E-UTRAN_QRXLEVMIN for the cell's frequency.
For a GSM cell, S_GSM is defined as the C1 value for the cell (see subclause
6.4);
Cell reselection to a cell of another inter-RAT frequency shall be performed
if any of the conditions below (to be evaluated in the order shown) is
satisfied:
\- The S_non-serving_XXX of one or more cells of a higher priority inter-RAT
frequency is greater than THRESH_XXX_high during a time interval
T_reselection; in that case, the mobile station shall consider the cells for
reselection in decreasing order of priority and, for cells of the same
priority, in decreasing order of S_non-serving_XXX, and reselect the first
cell that satisfies the conditions above;
\- The value of S_GSM is lower than THRESH_GSM_low for the serving cell and
all measured GSM cells during a time interval T_reselection; in this case, the
mobile station shall consider for reselection the inter-RAT cells in the
following order, and reselect the first one that satisfies the following
criteria:
\- cells of a lower priority inter-RAT frequency whose S_non-serving_XXX is
greater than THRESH_XXX_low during a time interval T_reselection; these cells
shall be considered in decreasing order of priority and, for cells of the same
priority, in decreasing order of S_non-serving_XXX;
\- if no cells satisfy the criterion above, inter-RAT cells for which, during
a time interval T_reselection, S_non-serving_XXX is higher than S_GSM for the
serving cell by at least a specific hysteresis _H_PRIO_ ; these cells shall be
considered in decreasing order of S_non-serving_XXX.
A UTRAN FDD cell shall only be reselected if, in addition to the criteria
above, its measured Ec/No value is equal to or greater than FDD_Qmin -
FDD_Qmin_Offset.
E-UTRAN cells which are included in the list of not allowed cells shall not be
considered as candidates for cell reselection. If the strongest cells on a
E-UTRAN frequency are included in the list of not allowed cells, the mobile
station may reselect the strongest valid cell (see subclause 8.4.7) on that
frequency.
Cell reselection to a cell of another radio access technology (e.g. UTRAN or
E-UTRAN) shall not occur within 5 seconds after the MS has reselected a GSM
cell from an inter-RAT cell if a suitable GSM cell can be found.
If a mobile station in _camped normally_ state (see 3GPP TS 43.022) has valid
individual priorities which do not include a priority for the serving cell,
the mobile station shall consider the serving cell to have lowest priority
(i.e. lower than the eight network configured values).
A mobile station in _camped on_ _any cell_ state (see 3GPP TS 43.022) shall
ignore individual priorities received through dedicated signalling and shall
apply priorities received from the system information of the serving cell
while attempting to find a suitable cell. If the mobile station supports CS
voice services, the MS shall avoid reselecting acceptable (but not suitable)
E-UTRA cells regardless of the priorities provided in system information.
NOTE 4: If the MS is camping on an acceptable cell, individual priorities are
not discarded until an event leading to their deletion occurs.
In case of a reselection attempt towards a barred UTRAN cell, the MS shall
abandon further reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell as defined by the
T~barred~ value on the barred UTRAN cell (see 3GPP TS 25.331).
In case of a reselection attempt towards a barred E-UTRAN cell, the MS shall
abandon further reselection attempts towards this E-UTRAN cell for a period of
up to 20 min.
In case the MS attempts reselection to a UTRAN cell which is not suitable (see
3GPP TS 25.304) due to being part of the \"list of forbidden LAs for roaming\"
or belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the
registered PLMN, the MS may abandon further reselection attempts towards this
UTRAN cell and all other cells on the same frequency, for a period of up to 20
min. If the MS has to perform cell selection, this limitation shall be
removed. If the MS is redirected under GERAN control to a frequency for which
the timer is running, any limitation on that frequency shall be removed.
In case the MS attempts reselection to a E-UTRAN cell which is not suitable
(see 3GPP TS 36.304) due to being part of the \"list of forbidden tracking
areas for roaming\" (see 3GPP TS 24.301), and if the MS has received the PCID
to TA Mapping information element (see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060) for
the frequency of the cell, it shall abandon further reselection attempts
towards this E-UTRAN cell and any E-UTRAN cell which is known to belong to the
same Tracking Area until the PCID to TA Mapping information changes in the
serving cell or until cell reselection occurs. If the mobile station has not
received the PCID to TA Mapping information element for the frequency of the
cell, the MS may abandon further reselection attempts towards this E-UTRAN
cell and all other cells on the same frequency, for a period of up to 20 min.
If the MS has to perform cell selection, this limitation shall be removed. If
the MS is redirected under GERAN control to a frequency for which the timer is
running, any limitation on that frequency shall be removed.
In case the MS attempts reselection to a E-UTRAN cell which is not suitable
(see 3GPP TS 36.304) due to belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as
being equivalent to the registered PLMN, the MS may abandon further
reselection attempts towards this E-UTRAN cell and all other cells on the same
frequency, for a period of up to 20 min. If the MS has to perform cell
selection, this limitation shall be removed. If the MS is redirected under
GERAN control to a frequency for which the timer is running, any limitation on
that frequency shall be removed.
The MS shall store the UTRAN cell RSCP suitability criterion parameters
specified in sub-clause 6.6.5, whenever decoded from a UTRAN FDD cell of a
PLMN in the stored list of equivalent PLMNs (see 3GPP TS 24.008) while
attempting to reselect to a UTRAN FDD cell as part of the priority-based
reselection algorithm. Stored RSCP suitability criteria shall not be used to
evaluate the suitability of a UTRAN cell when evaluating a cell for
reselection using the priority-based reselection algorithm.
### 6.6.7 Cell selection and re-selection to CSG cells
#### 6.6.7.1 Cell re-selection to CSG cells
If a mobile station is a member of at least one Closed Subscriber Group, i.e.
at least one CSG ID and its PLMN ID is included in the MS's \"A**llowed CSG**
**list** \"**, then,** in addition to normal cell reselection, the MS shall
use an autonomous search function to detect UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN CSG cells.
The autonomous search function shall at least detect previously visited
allowed CSG cells.
NOTE 1: The autonomous search function is implementation dependent and
controls when and/or where to search for allowed CSG cells.
NOTE 2: A cell is a CSG cell if the CSG Indicator in its system information is
set to TRUE.
NOTE 3: The \"Allowed CSG list\" is stored in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102).
If the strongest cell (see 3GPP TS 25.304 and 3GPP TS 36.304 for the
definition of the strongest cell) which the MS has detected on a UTRAN or
E-UTRAN frequency during a time interval T_reselection is a suitable CSG cell
(see 3GPP TS 25.304 and 3GPP TS 36.304 for suitability criteria for UTRAN and
E-UTRAN CSG cells respectively), the MS shall reselect to this cell
irrespective of the cell reselection rules applicable for the cell on which
the MS is currently camped.
The following requirements are valid for reselection to allowed CSG cells
previously visited by the MS when the radio configuration parameters,
including the carrier frequency and PSC/PCI (whichever and if it is
applicable) of the CSG cell, non CSG cell and other neighbour cells, are
unchanged from the most recent previous visit. The autonomous search and cell
re-selection to a previously visited allowed CSG cell shall meet the
performance requirements defined as follows:
  * the MS shall perform search and re-selection to a previously visited allowed UTRAN FDD CSG cell, that has met the CSG cell re-selection criterion defined above, within 6 minutes in the radio conditions specified for an UTRAN FDD CSG cell in 3GPP TS 36.133 in terms of parameters for CSG inter-RAT UTRAN FDD reselection; UARFCN and PSC shall be unchanged from the most recent previous visit of the UTRAN FDD CSG cell; Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm;
  * the MS shall perform search and re-selection to a previously visited allowed E-UTRAN CSG cell, that has met the CSG cell re-selection criterion defined above, within 6 minutes in the radio conditions specified for an E-UTRAN CSG cell in 3GPP TS 25.133 in terms of parameters for CSG inter-RAT E-UTRA reselection; E-UARFCN and PCI shall be unchanged from the most recent previous visit of the E-UTRAN CSG cell; Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm.
NOTE 4: The above performance requirements are minimum requirements defined to
ensure the testability of autonomous CSG search.
The MS shall disable the autonomous search function for CSG cells if the MS
has no \"Allowed CSG list\" or the MS's \"A**llowed CSG** **list** \" is
empty.
When the MS has no or an empty \"Allowed CSG list\", and the MS has stored
\"CSG PSC Split Information\" or \"CSG PCI Split Information\", the MS shall
ignore for measurement and cell re-selection cells known to be CSG cells,
i.e.:
\- cells on a UTRAN frequency with PSC in the stored range \"CSG PSC Split
Information\" for that frequency (see 3GPP TS 25.331);
\- cells on an E-UTRAN frequency with PCI in the stored range \"CSG PCI Split
Information\" for that frequency (see 3GPP TS 36.331).
In addition, when the MS has no or an empty \"Allowed CSG list\", the MS may
ignore for measurement and cell re-selection cells known to be CSG cells
according to implementation specific means on a frequency for which no \"CSG
PCI Split Information\" or \"CSG PSC Split Information\" is stored.
The network may provide information about dedicated UTRAN CSG frequencies
and/or dedicated E-UTRAN CSG frequencies. In this case, the MS may use the
autonomous search function only on these dedicated frequencies and on the
other frequencies listed in the system information. When the MS has no or an
empty \"Allowed CSG list\", the MS shall ignore those frequencies for
measurement and cell re-selection.
A mobile station which has an \"Allowed CSG list\" which is not empty shall
not use stored RSCP parameters to evaluate a candidate UTRAN FDD CSG cell for
reselection, unless those (stored) parameters were obtained from a CSG cell
with the same physical layer identifiers (frequency and PSC).
The mobile station which has an \"Allowed CSG list\" which is not empty may
store the UTRAN cell RSCP suitability criterion parameters from a UTRAN FDD
CSG cell; in this case, these stored parameters shall be stored separately
from parameters stored as specified in sub-clauses 6.6.5 and 6.6.6 and may
only be used subsequently to evaluate a candidate CSG cell with the same
physical layer identifiers.
#### 6.6.7.2 Manual CSG ID selection
If NAS requests AS to search for available CSG IDs, the MS shall perform the
search and report the results to NAS as described in 3GPP TS 25.304 for UTRAN
and as described in 3GPP TS 36.304 for E-UTRAN.
If a CSG ID is manually selected by NAS, the MS shall behave as specified in
3GPP TS 25.304 or in 3GPP TS 36.304, depending on the RAT type of the selected
CSG cell.
## 6.7 Release of TCH, SDCCH and DBPSCH
### 6.7.1 Normal case
In _A/Gb mode_ , when the MS releases all TCHs or SDCCH and returns to idle
mode, packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, it shall, as quickly as possible,
camp on the cell whose channel has just been released. Similarly in _Iu mode_
, when the MS releases all DBPSCHs and returns to MAC-Idle state, it shall, as
quickly as possible, camp on the cell whose channel has just been released.
However, in both modes (_A/Gb mode_ or _Iu mode_), if the CHANNEL RELEASE
message contains a "cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and
SDCCH" (see TS 44.018), the MS shall as quickly as possible camp on an
indicated GSM, UTRAN or E-UTRAN cell that has been identified by the CHANNEL
RELEASE message. If UTRAN or E-UTRAN frequency only is indicated the MS shall
as quickly as possible camp on a suitable cell of this frequency.
In case the "cell selection indicator after release of all TCHs and SDCCH" is
not present, then if the full (P)BCCH data for that cell was not decoded in
the preceding 30s, the MS shall attempt to decode the full (P)BCCH data. Until
the MS has decoded the (P)BCCH data required for determining the paging group,
it shall also monitor all paging blocks on timeslot 0 of the BCCH carrier or,
for GPRS if PCCCH exists and for _Iu mode_ , on the PDCH indicated on BCCH for
possible paging messages that might address it. If the MS receives a page
before having decoded the full (P)BCCH data for the cell, the MS shall store
the page and respond once the relevant (P)BCCH data has been decoded, provided
that the cell is not barred and the MS\'s access class is allowed. Reception
of full BCCH(BA) information is not required before responding to the page.
If the CHANNEL RELEASE does not contain a "cell selection indicator after
release of all TCH and SDCCH", and the MS has the knowledge that the cell
whose channel is being released is not suitable (see 3GPP TS 43.022), the MS
is allowed to camp on any suitable cell.
If the CHANNEL RELEASE contains a "cell selection indicator after release of
all TCH and SDCCH" and
  * the MS cannot find a suitable cell from the indicated ones within 10 s, or
  * none of the indicated cells are suitable,
the MS is allowed to camp on any suitable cell.
NOTE: The received signal level measurements on surrounding cells made during
the last 5 seconds on the TCH or SDCCH in _A/Gb mode_ , or on the DBPSCH in
_Iu mode_ , may be averaged and used, where possible, to speed up the process.
However, it should be noted that the received signal level monitoring while on
the TCH or SDCCH in _A/Gb mode_ , or on the DBPSCH in _Iu mode_ , is on
carriers in BA (SACCH), while the carriers to be monitored for cell
reselection are in BA (BCCH) or BA (GPRS).
After decoding the relevant (P)BCCH data the MS shall perform cell reselection
as specified in 3GPP TS 43.022.
### 6.7.2 Call re‑establishment
In the event of a radio link failure, call re‑establishment may be attempted
on a GSM cell (according to the procedure in 3GPP TS 44.018). The MS shall
perform the following algorithm to determine which cell to use for the call
re‑establishment attempt.
i) The received signal level measurement samples taken on the carriers
indicated in the BA (SACCH) received on the serving cell and on the serving
cell BCCH carrier in the last 5 seconds shall be averaged, and the carrier
with the highest average received signal level with a permitted NCC as
indicated on the SACCH of the serving cell (see subclause 7.2) shall be taken.
ii) On this carrier the MS shall attempt to decode the BCCH data block
containing the parameters affecting cell selection.
iii) If the cell is suitable (see 3GPP TS 43.022) and call re‑establishment is
allowed, call re‑establishment shall be attempted on this cell.
iv) If the MS is unable to decode the BCCH data block or if the conditions in
iii) are not met, the carrier with the next highest average received signal
level with a permitted NCC shall be taken, and the MS shall repeat steps ii)
and iii) above.
v) If the cells with the 6 strongest average received signal level values with
a permitted NCC have been tried but cannot be used, the call re‑establishment
attempt shall be abandoned, and the algorithm of subclause 6.7.1 shall be
performed.
The MS is under no circumstances allowed to access a cell to attempt call
re‑establishment later than 20 seconds after the detection within the MS of
the radio link failure causing the call re‑establishment attempt. In the case
where the 20 seconds elapses without a successful call re‑establishment the
call re‑establishment attempt shall be abandoned, and the algorithm of
subclause 6.7.1 shall be performed.
Call re‑establishment shall not be applied for voice group calls.
## 6.8 Abnormal cases and emergency calls
When in the limited service state (see 3GPP TS 43.022) the aim is to gain
normal service rapidly and the following tasks shall be performed, depending
on the conditions, as given in the table below:
a) The MS shall monitor the received signal level of all RF channels within
its bands of operation, and search for a BCCH carrier which has C1 > 0 and
which is not barred. When such a carrier is found, the MS shall camp on that
cell, irrespective of the PLMN identity.
b) The MS shall search the strongest RF channels to determine which PLMNs are
available (Manual Mode) or available and allowable (Automatic Mode). This
information shall be processed according to the PLMN selection algorithm
defined in 3GPP TS 43.022.
c) The MS shall perform cell reselection at least among the cells of the PLMN
of the cell on which the MS has camped, according to the algorithm of 3GPP TS
43.022, except that a zero value of CELL_RESELECT_HYSTERESIS shall be used.
+------------+------------+------------+------------+-----+-----+ | | Condition | | Tasks to | | | | | | | be | | | | | | | performed | | | | | | | as a | | | | | | | minimum: | | | +------------+------------+------------+------------+-----+-----+ | SIM | Other | MS camped | a) | b) | c) | | Present | | on a cell | | | | +------------+------------+------------+------------+-----+-----+ | X | X | No | Yes | No | No | +------------+------------+------------+------------+-----+-----+ | No | X | Yes | No | No | Yes | +------------+------------+------------+------------+-----+-----+ | Yes | \"IMSI | Yes | No | No | Yes | | | Unknown\", | | | | | | | \"illegal | | | | | | | MS\" | | | | | +------------+------------+------------+------------+-----+-----+ | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | | | suitable | | | | | | | cell of | | | | | | | selected | | | | | | | PLMN | | | | | | | | | | | | | | or \"PLMN | | | | | | | not | | | | | | | allowed\" | | | | | +------------+------------+------------+------------+-----+-----+ | NOTE: X = | | | | | | | \"Don\'t | | | | | | | care | | | | | | | state\". | | | | | | +------------+------------+------------+------------+-----+-----+
In this state, the only services available to the mobile station are:
i) the establishment of emergency calls (which may only be made if task c) was
being performed).
ii) the reception of warning notifications in the conditions where the mobile
station is able to receive paging as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122.
Powering down of the MS is permitted.
# 7 Network pre-requisites
## 7.1 BCCH carriers
The BCCH carrier shall be continuously transmitted on all timeslots.
It shall be transmitted without variation of RF level in case all timeslots on
BCCH carrier are GMSK modulated and else in case of different modulated
timeslots with minimum variation of RF level as specified below.
The RF power level may be ramped down between timeslots for instance to
facilitate switching between RF transmitters.
A BTS that is switching transmission between two or more antennas, shall use
the same antenna for transmission on a CCCH slot and the slot immediately
preceding the CCCH slot (i.e. antenna switching shall be avoided immediately
before a CCCH slot in order to avoid unpredictable path loss changes at this
point).
For timeslots on the BCCH carrier which are transmitted with modulations other
than GMSK, the output power (as defined in 3GPP TS 45.005) may be lower than
the output power used for GMSK modulated timeslots. In this case, the maximum
allowed difference in output power actually transmitted by the BTS is listed
for each respective modulation of EGPRS and EGPRS2 in the table below.
Furthermore, between a slot used for BCCH/CCCH and the slot preceding it, the
difference in output power actually transmitted by the BTS shall not exceed 3
dB.
NOTE: The allowed output power decrease does not refer to a difference between
nominal power levels, but to the difference in output power actually
transmitted.
+----------+------------+--------------+ | | Modulation | Output Power | | | | | | | | Decrease | +----------+------------+--------------+ | EGPRS | 8PSK | 4 dB | +----------+------------+--------------+ | EGPRS2-A | 16QAM | 6 dB | +----------+------------+--------------+ | EGPRS2-A | 32QAM | 6 dB | +----------+------------+--------------+ | EGPRS2-B | QPSK | 4 dB | +----------+------------+--------------+ | EGPRS2-B | 16QAM | 6 dB | +----------+------------+--------------+ | EGPRS2-B | 32QAM | 6 dB | +----------+------------+--------------+
The MS requirements on signal strength measurements are defined for the case
when only GMSK modulation is used on the BCCH carrier. There are no defined
signal strength measurement requirements for the MS if other modulations are
used on the BCCH carrier.
On the PCH the network shall send valid layer 3 messages according to 3GPP TS
44.018. Unused signalling blocks on the CCCH/BCCH shall contain L2 fill
frames. Other unused timeslots shall transmit dummy bursts.
The number of neighbour cell BCCH carriers in the BCCH allocation shall not
exceed 32.
NOTE 1: This BCCH organization enables MS to measure the received signal level
from surrounding cells by tuning and listening to their BCCH carriers.
Providing that an MS tunes to the list of BCCH carriers indicated by the
network it will, providing the list is sufficiently complete, have listened to
all possible surrounding cells, i.e. the surrounding cell list for handover
purposes is effectively defined by the MS. Refer to 3GPP TS 43.022 for
definitions of the BCCH carrier lists. This can be achieved without inter‑base
station synchronization.
NOTE 2: If the operator decides to allow for the usage of modulation types
other than GMSK on the BCCH carrier in certain cells, the cell selection, cell
reselection and handover procedures involving these cells will be somewhat
sub-optimal. This is due to the fact that the signal level measured by the MS
at some instances in time will be affected by the possibly lower output power
level of the 8-PSK modulation type used in EGPRS, and by the output power
level of QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM modulation types used in EGPRS2,
respectively, and by the power fluctuation resulting from these modulation
types other than GMSK. The extent of the performance degradation is dependent
upon the measurement schedule in each particular MS as well as upon the used
output power decrease and the current load of the modulation types other than
GMSK on the BCCH carrier. By limiting the maximum number of time slots,
carrying modulation types other than GMSK, being simultaneously allowed on the
BCCH carrier, and/or carefully selecting the values of involved network
parameters, the impact on the above mentioned procedures may be minimised.
Additionally, in areas with very low cell overlap, some coverage loss effects
may have to be taken into account by the operator when selecting network
parameters.
NOTE 3: In the case that QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM or 32-QAM modulation s (see Note
2) are allowed on the BCCH carrier and frequency hopping including the BCCH
carrier is used, the reception quality in connected mode for some fast moving
MS (meaning MS experiencing Doppler frequencies of 100 Hz or more) may be
degraded. This may be seen as a backwards compatibility problem for some
existing MS, most likely occurring if the used APD is larger than 2 dB.
## 7.2 Identification of surrounding BSS for handover measurements
It is essential for the MS to identify which surrounding BSS is being measured
in order to ensure reliable handover. Because of frequency re‑use with small
cluster sizes, the BCCH carrier frequency may not be sufficient to uniquely
identify a surrounding cell, i.e. the cell in which the MS is situated may
have more than one surrounding cell using the same BCCH frequency. Thus it is
necessary for the MS to synchronize to and demodulate surrounding BCCH
carriers and identify the base station identification code (BSIC). The MS
shall be able to perform this task at levels down to the reference sensitivity
level or reference interference levels as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005.
The MS shall use at least 4 spare frames per SACCH block period for the
purpose of decoding the BSICs (e.g. in the case of TCH/F, the four idle frames
per SACCH block period). These frames are termed \"search\" frames.
A 6 bit Base Station Identity Code (BSIC), as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003, shall
be transmitted on each BCCH carrier. The PLMN part of the BSIC can be regarded
as a \"PLMN colour code\".
The MS shall attempt to demodulate the SCH on the BCCH carrier of as many
surrounding cells as possible, and decode the BSIC as often as possible, and
as a minimum at least once every 10 seconds. A multi-RAT MS is allowed to
extend this period to 13 seconds, if the neighbour cell list contains cells or
frequencies from other RATs. The MS shall give priority for synchronisation
attempts in signal strength order and considering the parameter
MULTIBAND_REPORTING. A list containing information about the timing of the
surrounding cells at the accuracy required for accessing a cell (see 3GPP TS
45.010) including the absolute times derived from the parameters T1, T2, T3
shall be kept by the MS. This information may be used to schedule the decoding
of BSIC and shall be used in connection with handover in order to keep the
switching time at a minimum. The network may provide Real Time Difference
(RTD, see 3GPP TS 45.010) to assist the MS in neighbour cell synchronisation
attempts. This assistance data is included in the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION
message (See 3GPP TS 44.018). RTD is provided modulo one multiframe (51 TDMA
frames). The resolution is either one TDMA frame, in which case the MS can
assume that the cells are frame synchronised, or 1/64 TDMA frame. The MS may
use other assistance data too, if received elsewhere, e.g. for position
services received information. The actual number of carriers the MS is capable
of synchronising to, depends on the Observed Time Difference (OTD, see 3GPP TS
45.010) for each neighbour cell and the availability of the assistance
information.
If, after averaging measurement results over 2 SACCH block periods, the MS
detects one or more BCCH carriers, among the 6 strongest, whose BSICs are not
currently being assessed, then the MS shall as a matter of priority attempt to
decode their BSICs.
In the case of a multi band MS, the MS shall attempt to decode the BSIC, if
any BCCH carrier with unknown BSIC is detected among the number of strongest
BCCH carriers in each band as indicated by the parameter MULTIBAND_REPORTING.
Thus an MS shall, for a period of up to 5 seconds, devote all search frames to
attempting to decode these BSICs. If this fails then the MS shall return to
confirming existing BSICs. Having re‑confirmed existing BSICs, if there are
still BCCH carriers, among the six strongest, with unknown BSICs, then the
decoding of these shall again be given priority for a further period of up to
5 seconds.
The MS shall report a new strongest GSM cell in the measurement report at the
latest 5 s after a new strongest cell (which is part of the BA(SACCH)) has
been activated under the following network conditions: Initial serving cell at
RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then the new BCCH carrier
is switched on at RXLEV= -60 dBm.
NOTE: Because of test equipment limitations it is acceptable to activate the
new carrier to replace one of the 6 neighbours.
If either no BSIC can be demodulated on a surrounding cell BCCH carrier, or
the BSIC is not allowed, then the received signal level measurements on that
channel shall be discarded. The allowed BSIC is either the BSIC broadcast for
that carrier in the neighbour cell list or, if no BSIC is included or if
indicated by the parameter INVALID_BSIC_REPORTING, a BSIC with permitted NCC
part. The permitted NCCs are defined by the NCC_PERMITTED parameter
transmitted in the BCCH data. This is an 8 bit map that relates to the NCC
part of BSIC (e.g. NCC_PERMITTED = 01101001, defines that only carriers having
a BSIC with the NCC part = 000, 011, 101,110 shall be reported).
If a change of BSIC is detected on a carrier, then any existing received
signal level measurement shall be discarded and a new averaging period
commenced. This occurs when the MS moves away from one surrounding cell and
closer to another co‑channel cell.
If the BSIC cannot be decoded at the next available opportunities re‑attempts
shall be made to decode this BSIC. If the BSIC is not decoded for more than
three successive attempts it will be considered lost and any existing received
signal level measurement shall be discarded.
If an MS receives a handover command towards a GSM cell to which it is not
synchronised to, then the MS shall search for synchronisation information up
to 300 ms. In case of failure, the MS shall refer to the handover failure
procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
If a multi-RAT MS receives a handover command towards a not known cell (see
3GPP TS 25.133 and 3GPP TS 25.123 for UTRAN), then the multi-RAT MS shall
search for synchronisation information up to 800 ms. In case of failure, the
multi-RAT MS shall refer to the handover failure procedure (see 3GPP TS
44.018).
Details of the synchronization mechanisms appear in 3GPP TS 45.010. The
procedure for monitoring surrounding BTS with respect to HO measurement shall
begin at least at the time of assignment of a dedicated channel.
When a BCCH carrier is found to be no longer among the reported, timing and
BSIC information shall be retained for at least 10 seconds. (This is in case a
handover is commanded to this cell just after the MS stops reporting RXLEV and
RXQUAL on this cell).
## 7.3 Handover measurements on other radio access technologies
For a multi-RAT MS, the network controls the identification and measurements
of UTRAN and CDMA2000 cells by the parameter Qsearch_C sent on SACCH or, if
Qsearch_C is not received, by Qsearch_C_Initial sent on BCCH. Qsearch_C
defines a threshold and also indicates whether these tasks shall be performed
when RXLEV (see subclause 8.1.3) of the serving BCCH carrier is below or above
the threshold.
If the serving cell is not included in the BA(SACCH) list, the dedicated
channel is not on the BCCH carrier, and Qsearch_C is not equal to 15, the MS
shall disregard the Qsearch_C parameter value and always search for UTRAN and
CDMA2000 cells. If Qsearch_C is equal to 15, the MS shall never search for
UTRAN or CDMA2000 cells.
For a UTRAN capable MS, the network enables the identification and measurement
for UTRAN cells on specific frequencies by DEFAULT_Measurement_Control_UTRAN
and Measurement_Control_UTRAN sent on SACCH.
For a E-UTRAN capable MS, the network controls the identification and
measurements of E-UTRAN cells by the parameter Qsearch_C_E-UTRAN sent on SACCH
or, if Qsearch_C_E-UTRAN is not received, by Qsearch_C_E-UTRAN_Initial sent on
BCCH.
For a E-UTRAN capable MS, the network enables the identification and
measurement for E-UTRAN cells on specific frequencies by
DEFAULT_Measurement_Control_E-UTRAN and Measurement_Control_E-UTRAN sent on
SACCH.
The MS may use the search frames, which are not required for BSIC decoding,
for measurements of UTRAN, CDMA2000 and E-UTRAN cells. The MS may use up to 25
search frames per 13 seconds without considering the need for BSIC decoding in
these frames.
A UTRAN capable MS shall report a new best UTRAN cell, which is part of the
neighbour cell list, at the latest 5 seconds after it has been activated under
the condition that there is only one UTRAN frequency in the neighbour cell
list (and no E-UTRAN frequencies in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list) and that
no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good radio
conditions. A E-UTRAN capable MS that supports measurement reporting in
dedicated mode or dual transfer mode shall report a new best E-UTRAN cell, on
a frequency contained in the neighbour cell list, at the latest 5 seconds
after it has been activated under the condition that there is only one E-UTRAN
frequency in the neighbour cell list (and no UTRAN frequencies in the 3G
Neighbour Cell list) and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same time
and under good radio conditions. For test purposes the following radio
conditions can be used: Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM
neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then either an UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an
UTRAN TDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN TDD
neighbour cell is switched on. The radio conditions for the UTRAN FDD cell are
as follows (see 3GPP TS 25.101 for definitions):

The allowed reporting time is increased by 5 seconds for each additional UTRAN
frequency in the neighbour cell list or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency
in the neighbour cell list and by the time required for BSIC decoding of new
activated GSM cells. However, multiple UTRAN cells on the same frequency in
the neighbour cell list does not increase the allowed reporting time.
When on TCH, identification of a UTRAN TDD cell is guaranteed only in case of
single slot operation and, for the 3.84 Mcps option, if the UTRAN TDD cell
uses synchronisation option 2 (see 3GPP TS 25.221). In all other cases, the MS
may not be able to fulfil the requirement above. If after 5 seconds the MS has
not been able to identify a UTRAN TDD cell, the MS is allowed to stop
searching for it in the current GSM cell.
When on SDCCH, the MS may use all TDMA frames, which are not part of the
assigned channel or required for GSM signal strength measurements, for the
above task. In this case the allowed reporting time is 1.7 seconds, with the
same assumptions as above.
A multi-RAT MS shall be able to monitor cells from other radio access
technologies, divided into (depending on the MS capability):
\- UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD frequencies, with a maximum of 32 cells per
frequency\ \- UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies, with a maximum of 32
cells per frequency; and/or\ \- CDMA2000 cells; and/or\ \- E-UTRAN FDD cells
on up to 3 FDD frequencies; and/or\ \- E-UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD
frequencies.
The total number of monitored UTRAN and CDMA2000 cells shall not exceed 64.
The MS is not required to measure, and shall not report, cells known to be CSG
cells (see sub-clause 6.6.7.1) while in dedicated mode or dual transfer mode.
# 8 Radio link measurements
Radio link measurements are used in the handover and RF power control
processes.
In particular, radio‑subsystem directed handover is defined as a change of
channel(s) during a call either because of degradation of the quality of one
or more of the current serving channel(s), or because of the availability of
other channel(s) which can allow communication at a lower TX power level, or
to prevent a MS grossly exceeding the planned cell boundaries.
Additional measurements, so called Extended measurements, can e.g. be used for
frequency planning purposes.
The measurements are made over each SACCH multiframe, which is 104 TDMA frames
(480 ms) for a TCH and DBPSCH, and 102 TDMA frames (470,8 ms) for an SDCCH.
Additionally, when in FPC mode, quality measurements shall also be made over
each FPC reporting period. Additionally, when in EPC mode, quality
measurements shall also be made over each EPC reporting period.
For a multi-RAT MS, measurements on other radio access technologies may be
performed during search frames (see subclause 7.3 and 10.1.1.3).
## 8.1 Signal level
### 8.1.1 General
The received signal level may be employed as a criterion in the RF power
control and handover processes. For cells of other radio access technology,
RXLEV is replaced by the relevant measurement quantity for that radio access
technology (see subclause 8.1.5).
### 8.1.2 Physical parameter
The R.M.S received signal level at the receiver input shall be measured by the
MS and the BSS over the full range of ‑110 dBm to ‑48 dBm with an absolute
accuracy of ±4 dB from ‑110 dBm to ‑70 dBm under normal conditions and ±6 dB
over the full range under both normal and extreme conditions. The R.M.S
received signal level at the receiver input shall be measured by the MS above
-48 dBm up to -38 dBm with an absolute accuracy of ± 9 dB under both normal
and extreme conditions.
If the received signal level falls below the reference sensitivity level for
the type of MS or BSS, then the measured level shall be within the range
allowing for the absolute accuracy specified above. In case the upper limit of
this range is below the reference sensitivity level for the type of MS or BSS,
then the upper limit shall be considered as equal to the reference sensitivity
level.
The relative accuracy shall be as follows:
If signals of level x1 and x2 dBm are received (where x1 ≤ x2) and levels y1
and y2 dBm respectively are measured, if x2 ‑ x1 \ x1 ≥ s+1 3 2 5 4 s+1 > x1 4 2 6 4
* * *
For single band MS or BTS and measurements between ARFN in the same band for a
multiband
MS or BTS;
s = reference sensitivity level as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005.
For measurements between ARFCN in different bands;
s = the reference sensitivity level as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005 for the
band including x1.
At extreme temperature conditions an extra 2 dB shall be added to c and d in
above table.
The selectivity of the received signal level measurement shall be as follows:
‑ for adjacent (200 kHz) channel ≥ 16 dB;
‑ for adjacent (400 kHz) channel ≥ 48 dB;
‑ for adjacent (600 kHz) channel ≥ 56 dB.
The selectivity shall be met using random, continuous, GSM‑modulated signals
with the wanted signal at the level 20 dB above the reference sensitivity
level.
### 8.1.3 Statistical parameters
For each channel, the measured parameters (RXLEV) shall be the average of the
received signal level measurement samples in dBm taken on that channel within
the reporting period of length one SACCH multiframe defined in 8.4. In
averaging, measurements made during previous reporting periods shall always be
discarded.
When assigned a TCH or SDCCH in _A/Gb mode_ , or a DBPSCH in _Iu mode_ , the
MS shall make a received signal level measurement:
‑ in every TDMA frame on at least one of the BCCH carriers indicated in the
BCCH allocation (BA), one after another. Optionally, measurements during up to
8 frames per SACCH multiframe may be omitted;
> As an exception, a multi-RAT MS may omit GSM measurements during up to 9
> TDMA frames per SACCH multiframe and use these periods for measurements on
> other radio access technologies.\ Furthermore, an MS on SDCCH is allowed
> schedule the measurements freely within the SACCH multiframe as long as the
> total number of measurement samples is maintained and the samples on each
> carrier are evenly spaced.
NOTE: These eight frames are the search frames and the frames immediately
preceding the search frames, in order to allow the MS to search for BCCH
synchronization (or inter-RAT measurements) over a full TDMA frame.
‑ for each assigned bi‑directional channel, on all bursts of the associated
physical channel (see 3GPP TS 45.002), including those of the SACCH. If
frequency hopping is being used on the associated physical channel and if, in
the BCCH Cell Options, the Power Control Indicator PWRC is set, measurements
on the bursts on the BCCH frequency shall not be used in the RXLEV averaging
process.
Unless otherwise specified by the operator, for any TCH or SDCCH assigned to
an MS in _A/Gb mode_ , or for any DBPSCH assigned to an MS in _Iu mode_ , the
BSS shall make a received signal level measurement on all time slots of the
associated physical channel including those of the SACCH, but excluding the
idle timeslots.
### 8.1.4 Range of parameter
The measured signal level shall be mapped to an RXLEV value between 0 and 63,
as follows:
RXLEV 0 = less than ‑110 dBm + SCALE.\ RXLEV 1 = ‑110 dBm + SCALE to ‑109 dBm
+ SCALE.\ RXLEV 2 = ‑109 dBm + SCALE to ‑108 dBm + SCALE.\ :\ :\ RXLEV 62 =
‑49 dBm + SCALE to ‑48 dBm + SCALE.\ RXLEV 63 = greater than ‑48 dBm + SCALE.
where SCALE is an offset that is used in the ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT and
PACKET ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT messages, otherwise it is set to 0.
The MS shall use the SCALE value as indicated by the parameter SCALE_ORD in
the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION, PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER and PACKET MEASUREMENT
ORDERmessages (see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060). If automatic scaling
mode is indicated by SCALE_ORD, the MS shall choose the lowest SCALE value
that is sufficient for reporting the strongest signal level within each
ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT or PACKET ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message.
The MS shall indicate the used SCALE value in each individual ENHANCED
MEASUREMENT REPORT or PACKET ENHANCED MEASUREMEMT REPORTmessage (see 3GPP TS
44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060).
### 8.1.5 Measurement quantity for other radio access technologies
#### 8.1.5.1 UTRAN FDD
For UTRAN FDD cells, the measurement quantities to be used are CPICH Ec/No and
CPICH RSCP and RSSI. The measurement requirements are defined in 3GPP TS
25.133.
RSCP shall be used for the cell re-selection criteria. Ec/No and RSCP shall be
used for a minimum quality requirement. Either RSCP or Ec/No shall be used for
measurement reporting as indicated by the parameter FDD_REP_QUANT, sent on
BCCH, SACCH, PBCCH and PACCH. In addition, if a frequency without scrambling
code is included in the neighbour cell list, RSSI shall be reported for that
frequency.
The measured value shall replace RXLEV in the measurement reports. The mapping
is defined in 3GPP TS 25.133. For RSCP, the range from "‑116 dBm ≤ CPICH RSCP

The accuracy requirements for CV_BEP need not be specified since they are
directly linked to those for MEAN_BEP. Nevertheless, the CV_BEP measured at
the MS shall be the one used by this MS.
## 8.3 Aspects of discontinuous transmission (DTX)
When DTX is employed on a TCH, not all TDMA frames may be transmitted.
However, the following subset shall always be transmitted, except for TCH/AFS,
TCH/WFS, O-TCH/WFS, TCH/AHS, O-TCH/AHS and O-TCH/WHS, and hence can be
employed to assess quality and signal level during DTX.
* * *
Type of channel TDMA frame subset always to be transmitted TDMA frame number
(FN) modulo 104 TCH/F 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 TCH/HS,subchannel 0 0, 2,
4, 6, 52, 54, 56, 58 TCH/HS,subchannel 1 14, 16, 18, 20, 66, 68, 70, 72
TCH/H,data,subchannel 0,uplink 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 71
TCH/H,data,subchannel 0,downlink 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75
TCH/H,data,subchannel 1,uplink 70, 72, 74, 76, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89
TCH/H,data,subchannel 1,downlink 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 79, 81, 83, 85
* * *
This subset of TDMA frames is always used for transmission during DTX. For
speech TCH, when no signalling or speech is to be transmitted these TDMA
frames are occupied by the SID (Silence Descriptor) frame, see 3GPP TS 46.012
and 3GPP TS 46.031 for detailed specification of the SID frame and its
transmission requirements. For data TCH when no information is required to be
transmitted, the L2 fill frame (see 3GPP TS 44.006 subclause 5.4.2.3) shall be
transmitted as a FACCH in the TDMA frame subset always to be transmitted. For
PDTCH on DBPSCH in _Iu mode_ , when no information is required to be
transmitted a dummy block (see 3GPP TS 44.160) shall be sent as a PACCH in the
TDMA frame subset always to be transmitted.
On the SDCCH and on the half rate traffic channel TCH/H in signalling only
mode DTX is not allowed. In these cases and on the TCH/F in signalling only
mode when DTX is not used, the same L2 fill frame shall be transmitted in case
there is nothing else to transmit.
On TCH/AFS, TCH/WFS, O-TCH/WFS, TCH/AHS, O-TCH/AHS and O-TCH/WHS, there is no
fixed subset of TDMA frames that will always be transmitted during DTX. A
detection algorithm is required in the receiver which informs about whether a
SID_UPDATE (see 3GPP TS 45.003 and 3GPP TS 26.093) frame was transmitted (and
thus can be used for quality and signal level estimation) or not.
If no FPC commands are received during a reporting period, the SACCH power
command shall be used.
In _Iu mode_ , when DTX is employed on a DBPSCH with PDTCH or FLO, not all
TDMA frames may be transmitted. However a minimum number of blocks shall
always be transmitted during DTX. When nothing but SACCH blocks are
transmitted (hereafter referred to as silent period), the following rules
ensure that L2 dummy blocks (see 3GPP TS 44.160) are at least transmitted,
according to the configuration of the DBPSCH (see 3GPP TS 44.118):
\- when 4 bursts rectangular interleaving is used on DBPSCH/F (PDTCH/F or
FLO), a L2 dummy block shall be sent after every silent period of 44 TDMA
frames, excluding SACCH and idle frames (i.e. 220ms).
\- when 8 bursts diagonal interleaving is used on DBPSCH/F (FLO), a L2 dummy
block shall be sent after every silent period of 40 TDMA frames, excluding
SACCH and idle frames (i.e. 200ms).
\- when 4 bursts rectangular interleaving is used on DBPSCH/H (PDTCH/H or
FLO), or when 4 bursts diagonal interleaving is used on DBPSCH/H (FLO), a L2
dummy block shall be sent after every silent period of 20 TDMA frames,
excluding SACCH and idle frames (i.e. 200ms).
## 8.4 Measurement reporting
### 8.4.1 Measurement reporting for the MS
In _A/Gb mode_ , for a TCH and in _Iu mode_ , for a DBPSCH, the reporting
period of length 104 TDMA frames (480 ms) is defined in terms of TDMA frame
numbers (FN) as follows:
* * *
Timeslot number (TN) TDMA frame number (FN) modulo 104  
Full Rate Half rate, subch.0 Half rate, subch.1 Reporting period SACCH Message
block 0 0 and 1 0 to 103 12, 38, 64, 90 1 0 and 1 13 to 12 25, 51, 77, 103 2 2
and 3 26 to 25 38, 64, 90, 12 3 2 and 3 39 to 38 51, 77, 103, 25 4 4 and 5 52
to 51 64, 90, 12, 38 5 4 and 5 65 to 64 77, 103, 25, 51 6 6 and 7 78 to 77 90,
12, 38, 64 7 6 and 7 91 to 90 103, 25, 51, 77
* * *
For a multislot configuration, the reporting period and SACCH Message block
for each timeslot is defined as for TCH/F or PDTCH/F or DBPSCH/F for TN = 0.
In _A/Gb mode_ , when on a TCH, or in _Iu mode_ , when on a DBPSCH, the MS
shall assess during the reporting period and transmit to the BSS in the next
SACCH message block the following:
‑ RXLEV for the BCCH carrier of the 6 cells with the highest RXLEV among those
with known and allowed NCC part of BSIC. For a multi band MS the number of
cells, for each frequency band supported, which shall be included is specified
in subclause 8.4.3. For a cell of other radio access technology, see
subclauses 8.1.5 and 8.4.7.
NOTE 1: Since there are 104 TDMA frames in each SACCH multiframe (and
measurement in 4 frames is optional), the number of samples on each BCCH
carrier will depend on the number of carriers defined in the BCCH Allocation
(BA) and may be different. The following table gives examples of this.
* * *
Number of BCCH carriers Number of samples per in BCCH Allocation carrier in
SACCH multiframe 32 3‑4 16 6‑7 10 10‑11 8 12‑13 : : : :
* * *
These figures are increased if the MS is able to make measurements on more
than one BCCH carrier during each TDMA frame.
‑ RXLEV_FULL and RXQUAL_FULL:\ In _A/Gb mode,_ RXLEV and RXQUAL for the full
set of TCH and SACCH TDMA frames. The full set of TDMA frames is either 100
(i.e. 104 ‑ 4 idle) frames for a full rate TCH or 52 frames for a half‑rate
TCH. Similarly in _Iu mode_ on DBPSCH _,_ RXLEV and RXQUAL for the full set of
TDMA frames. The full set of TDMA frames is either 100 frames for a full rate
DBPSCH or 52 frames for a half-rate DBPSCH.
‑ RXLEV_SUB and RXQUAL_SUB:\ RXLEV and RXQUAL for the subset of 4 SACCH frames
and the SID TDMA frames/ SID_UPDATE frames/L2 fill frames/dummy blocks defined
in 8.3.
> In case of data traffic channels TCH/F9.6, TCH/F4.8, TCH/H4.8 and TCH/H2.4,
> the RXQUAL_SUB report shall include measurements on the TDMA frames given in
> the table of subclause 8.3 only if L2 fill frames have been received as
> FACCH frames at the corresponding frame positions. If no FACCH frames have
> been received at the corresponding frame positions, the RXQUAL_SUB report
> shall include measurements on the 4 SACCH frames only. The performance
> requirements of subclause 8.2.4 do not apply in this case for RXQUAL_SUB.
>
> In _Iu mode_ , when DTX is employed on a DBPSCH with PDTCH or FLO,
> RXQUAL_SUB report shall include either measurements on positions given in
> subclause 8.3 only if L2 dummy blocks have been received at the
> corresponding positions, or measurements on positions where radio blocks
> (PDTCH) or radio packets (FLO) were correctly received (see subclause
> 8.4.8.2 or 8.2.3.2 respectively). If no L2 dummy blocks have been received
> at the corresponding frame positions, or if no radio blocks or radio packets
> have been correctly received, the RXQUAL_SUB report shall include
> measurements on the 4 SACCH frames only. The performance requirements of
> subclause 8.2.4 do not apply in this case for RXQUAL_SUB.
>
> In case of half rate speech channel TCH/HS, if an SID frame or a speech
> frame as defined in subclause 8.3 is replaced by an FACCH frame, the RXQUAL
> measurement on these frames shall be excluded from the RXQUAL SUB report.
> The performance requirements of subclause 8.2.4 do not apply in this case
> for RXQUAL SUB.
>
> In case of half rate traffic channel TCH/H in signalling only mode, -SUB
> values are set equal to the -FULL values in the SACCH message, since DTX is
> not allowed in this case.
>
> In the case of TCH/AFS, TCH/WFS, O-TCH/WFS, TCH/AHS, O-TCH/AHS or O-TCH/WHS,
> the RXLEV_SUB and RXQUAL_SUB shall take into account all detected SID_UPDATE
> frames in addition to the 4 SACCH frames. The performance requirements of
> subclause 8.2.4 for RXQUAL_SUB apply only for active DTX periods.
NOTE 2: If measurement on the BCCH carrier is not used, the number of TDMA
frames used in the RXLEV averaging process may be lower than the number of
TDMA frames in the set see subclause 8.1.3.
In case of a multislot configuration, the MS shall report the following
according to the definition above:
‑ on the main SACCH: the RXLEV values from the adjacent cells, RXLEV_FULL and
RXLEV_SUB from the main channel and the worst RXQUAL_FULL values and
RXQUAL_SUB values from the main channel and the unidirectional channels;
‑ on each other bi‑directional SACCH: the RXLEV values from the adjecent
cells, RXLEV_FULL, RXLEV_SUB, RXQUAL_FULL and RXQUAL_SUB from the
corresponding channel.
#### 8.4.1a Measurement reporting for the MS in FPC mode
For an E-TCH, the FPC reporting period of length 4 TDMA frames (20 ms) is
defined according to chapter 4.7,
When on an E-TCH using 8PSK for the uplink, the MS shall, in addition to what
is specified in chapter 8.4.1, assess during the FPC reporting period and
transmit to the BSS in the next scheduled FPC inband message (see chapter 4.7)
the following:
  * RXQUAL_FAST:\ RXQUAL for the set of 4 TDMA frames.
#### 8.4.1b Measurement reporting for the MS in EPC mode
In _A/Gb mode_ , for a TCH or O-TCH in enhanced power control (EPC) mode, and
in _Iu mode_ , for a DBPSCH in EPC mode, the EPC reporting period of length 26
TDMA frames (120 ms) is defined in terms of TDMA frame numbers (FN) as
follows:
* * *
Timeslot number (TN) TDMA frame number (FN) modulo 26  
Full rate Half rate, subch.0 Half rate, subch.1 Reporting period EPCCH Message
block 0,2,4,6 0...7 0 to 25 12 1,3,5,7 0...7 13 to 12 25
* * *
For a multislot configuration, the EPC reporting period and EPCCH Message
block for each timeslot is defined as for a full rate channel for TN = 0.
In A/Gb mode, for a TCH or O-TCH in EPC mode, and in _Iu mode_ , for a DBPSCH
in EPC mode, the MS shall, in addition to what is specified in subclause
8.4.1, transmit an EPC Downlink Quality Report to the BSS in each scheduled
EPCCH on the uplink, containing the assessed RXQUAL_EPC (as specified in
subclause 8.2.3.1). During one EPC reporting period, The RXQUAL_EPC
corresponding to the previous EPC reporting period shall be reported.
In case of a multislot configuration, the MS shall report the following
according to the definition above:
‑ on the main SACCH: the worst RXQUAL_EPC value from the main channel and the
unidirectional channels;
‑ on each other bi‑directional SACCH: the RXQUAL_EPC from the corresponding
channel.
### 8.4.2 Measurement reporting for the MS on a SDCCH
For a SDCCH, the reporting period of length 102 TDMA frames (470.8 ms) is
defined in terms of TDMA frame numbers (FN) as follows:
* * *
            TDMA frame number
            (FN) modulo 102
SDCCH/8 12 to 11 SDCCH/4 37 to 36
* * *
NOTE 1: Some SDCCH data or TCH speech, data or SID message blocks are spread
over two reporting periods. In these cases, the RXLEV and/or RXQUAL
information from the SDCCH or TCH message blocks may either be sent as part of
the measurement report of the second period, or shared between the reports of
the two periods.
When on a SDCCH, the MS shall assess during the reporting period and transmit
to the BSS in the next SACCH message block the following:
‑ RXLEV for the BCCH carrier of the 6 cells with the highest RXLEV among those
with known and allowed NCC part of BSIC. For a multi band MS the number of
cells, for each frequency band supported, which shall be included is specified
in subclause 8.4.3. For a cell of other radio access technology, see
subclauses 8.1.5 and 8.4.7.
NOTE 2: With only 102 TDMA frames in each SACCH multiframe, the number of
samples used to calculate RXLEV per BCCH carrier may be slightly different
from the case of TCH described above.
‑ RXLEV and RXQUAL for the full set of 12 (8 SDCCH and 4 SACCH) frames within
the reporting period. As DTX is not allowed on the SDCCH, ‑SUB values are set
equal to the ‑FULL values in the SACCH message.
NOTE 3: If measurement on the BCCH carrier is not used, the number of TDMA
frames used in the RXLEV averaging process may be lower than the number of
TDMA frames in the full set see subclause 8.1.3.
### 8.4.3 Additional cell reporting requirements for multi band MS
For a multi band MS the number of cells, for each frequency band supported,
which shall be included in the measurement report is indicated by the
parameter MULTIBAND_REPORTING, broadcast on BCCH and PBCCH. An MS attached to
GPRS shall use the parameter broadcast on PBCCH if it exists. In all other
cases, the MS shall use the parameter broadcast on BCCH. The parameter may
also be sent to the MS on SACCH.
The meaning of different values of the parameter is specified as follows:
**Value Meaning**
00 Normal reporting of the six strongest cells, with known and allowed NCC
part of BSIC, irrespective of the band used.
01 The MS shall report the strongest cell, with known and allowed NCC part of
BSIC, in each of the frequency bands in the BA list, excluding the frequency
band of the serving cell. The remaining positions in the measurement report
shall be used for reporting of cells in the band of the serving cell. If there
are still remaining positions, these shall be used to report the next
strongest identified cells in the other bands irrespective of the band used.
10 The MS shall report the two strongest cells, with known and allowed NCC
part of BSIC, in each of the frequency bands in the BA list, excluding the
frequency band of the serving cell. The remaining positions in the measurement
report shall be used for reporting of cells in the band of the serving cell.
If there are still remaining positions, these shall be used to report the next
strongest identified cells in the other bands irrespective of the band used.
11 The MS shall report the three strongest cells, with known and allowed NCC
part of BSIC, in each of the frequency bands in the BA list, excluding the
frequency band of the serving cell. The remaining positions in the measurement
report shall be used for reporting of cells in the band of the serving cell.
If there are still remaining positions, these shall be used to report the next
strongest identified cells in the other bands irrespective of the band used.
### 8.4.4 Common aspects for the MS on a TCH, a SDCCH or a DBPSCH
In _A/Gb mode_ , whether the MS is on a TCH or a SDCCH, and in _Iu mode_ when
the MS is on a DBPSCH, if an SACCH message block is used for a different Layer
3 message, the measurement report that would otherwise be sent in that block
is discarded and a new measurement report provided for the next SACCH message.
The MS shall also transmit a bit (DTX_USED) in the next SACCH message block,
which indicates whether or not it has employed DTX during the reporting
period. This bit shall be set even if just one burst in a TDMA frame in the
reporting period was not transmitted due to DTX.
NOTE: A speech or user data frame subject to DTX may cross the \"border\"
between two reporting periods, in which case both of the associated SACCH
message blocks will have the DTX_USED flag set.
The measurements in the MS shall be based on the current BA list and the
current NCC_PERMITTED (see table 1), available at the beginning of the
reporting period. At the transition from idle mode to a TCH or a SDCCH the
current BA list is the BA(BCCH), later the latest received complete BA(SACCH).
A complete BA(SACCH) for a MS shall be that contained in SI 5 and additionally
SI 5bis if the EXT-IND bit in the Neighbour Cell Description information
element in both the SI 5 and SI 5bis messages indicates that each information
element only carries part of the BA. If a SI 5ter message is subsequently
received and not ignored (see 3GPP TS 44.018) the BA(SACCH) shall be modified
accordingly.
At the transition from idle mode to a TCH or a SDCCH in _A/Gb mode_ , and to a
DBPSCH in _Iu mode_ , the current NCC is the NCC_PERMITTED received on the
BCCH, later the latest NCC_PERMITTED received on the SACCH. The measurement
process on carriers contained in both lists is, therefore, continuous.
If the current BA list does not refer to the serving cell, e.g. after a
handover, this shall be indicated and no measurement values for cells in the
BA list shall be reported.
If the MS returns to the previous cell after a failure of the handover
procedure the description above applies. As a consequence, a BA list (and/or
NCC_PERMITTED) received on the SACCH in the cell to which the handover failed
shall be regarded as the current ones, which may lead to interruptions in the
measurement reporting as the BA list does not refer to the serving cell. As an
option, the MS may in this case remember the last received BA list and
NCC_PERMITTED in the old cell and regard those as the current ones when
returning.
What is said in this subclause about the BA list also applies to the GSM
neighbour cell list when using enhanced measurement reporting and to the 3G
neighbour cell list for a multi-RAT MS. The rules for building of and changing
between neighbour cell lists are defined in 3GPP TS 44.018.
### 8.4.5 Measurement reporting for the BSS
In _A/Gb mode_ , unless otherwise specified by the operator, the BSS shall
make the same RXLEV (full and sub) and RXQUAL (full and sub) assessments as
described for the MS for all TCH\'s and SDCCH\'s assigned to an MS, using the
associated reporting periods. Simlarly in _Iu mode_ , unless otherwise
specified by the operator, the BSS shall make the same RXLEV (full and sub)
and RXQUAL (full and sub) assessments as described for the MS for all
DBPSCH\'s assigned to an MS, using the associated reporting periods. These
values, together with the reported values from the MS, shall be transmitted to
the BSC as described in the 3GPP TS 48.058.
### 8.4.6 Extended measurement reporting
When on a TCH or SDCCH in _A/Gb mode_ , or when on a DBPSCH in _Iu mode_ , the
mobile station may receive an Extended Measurement Order (EMO) message. The
mobile station shall then, during one reporting period, perform received
signal level measurements according to the frequency list contained in the EMO
message. BSIC decoding is not required for these frequencies. The mobile
station shall then transmit the measurement results in one single Extended
Measurement Report message, containing the following:
\- RXLEV (as defined in subclause 8.1.4) for the carriers specified by the
last received EMO message. If the EMO contains more than 21 carriers, only the
21 first carriers in the sorted EXTENDED MEASUREMENT FREQUENCY LIST (in the
EMO) are measured and reported.
\- DTX USED, as defined in subclause 8.4.4.
NOTE: the position of the signal strength measurement samples performed by the
mobile station, and the duration of these samples are not known in a TDMA
frame. Consequently, in case the signal level on the carrier the MS has to
monitor is not constant, the MS will report as the RXLEV value, the signal
strength measurements performed during its sampling period. This value can be
different from the mean value of the signal level on the whole frame.
If reporting is not possible due to requirements to send other Layer 3
messages, the measurements shall either be discarded and new measurements
scheduled at the next possible opportunity or saved and transmitted at the
next possible opportunity. If extended measurements can not be reported within
10 seconds after the triggering EMO was received, they shall be discarded (and
not reported).
If the EMO message contains frequencies outside the MS' frequency band, the MS
shall set the corresponding RXLEV value(s) to zero.
After a successful channel change, no Extended Measurement Report shall be
sent if the EMO was received before that channel change.
After having performed Extended Measurements during one reporting period, the
mobile station shall resume the measurements according to the current BA list.
This applies for each rescheduling of the Extended measurements.
### 8.4.7 Additional cell reporting requirements for multi-RAT MS
A multi-RAT MS shall report the number of best valid cells, in each supported
other radio access technology/mode in the neighbour cell list or on
frequencies contained in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, according to the
value of the parameters XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING (XXX indicates radio access
technology/mode). For UTRAN FDD, only cells with a reported value (CPICH Ec/No
or CPICH RSCP) equal or higher than FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD and a non-reported
value (from CPICH Ec/No and CPICH RSCP) equal or higher than
FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2, shall be reported. For E-UTRAN FDD or E-UTRAN TDD,
when 6-bit measurement reporting is used only cells with a reported value
(RSRP or RSRQ) equal or higher than E-UTRAN_FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD or
E-UTRAN_TDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD and with a non-reported value (from RSRP and
RSRQ) equal or higher than E-UTRAN_FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2 or
E-UTRAN_TDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2, respectively, shall be reported. When 3-bit
measurement reporting is used only cells with a measured value (RSRP and RSRQ)
equal or higher than E-UTRAN_FDD_MEASUREMENT_REPORT_OFFSET or
E-UTRAN_TDD_MEASUREMENT_REPORT_OFFSET and with a non-reported value (RSRP or
RSRQ) equal or higher than E-UTRAN_FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2 or
E-UTRAN_TDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2, respectively, shall be reported.
If there are more valid non-GSM cells than can be reported, the MS shall
select the cells for each supported RAT/mode for which XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING
is non-zero according to the following procedure:
1\. For each RAT/mode the best valid cell of each RAT/mode is included in the
report. The best cell is the cell with the highest reported value (see
subclause 8.1.5).
2 If there are further positions and cells available, the MS shall
additionally include in the report the next best valid cell on each RAT/mode
for which XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING cells have not yet been included. In case
this would result in including more cells than there are remaining spaces in
the measurement report, priority is given to cells from RATs/modes with higher
XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING value. In case of equal XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING values,
the cell for which (6 bit reported value -- XXX_REPORTING_THRESHOLD +
XXX_REPORTING_OFFSET) is highest is reported.
> 6 bit mapping for reported values shall be used in the calculations even if
> 3 bit reporting is used. In this case, instead of
> E-UTRAN_FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD or E-UTRAN_TDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD the
> mobile station shall use the 6 bit mapped value from
> E-UTRAN_FDD_MEASUREMENT_REPORT_OFFSET or
> E-UTRAN_TDD_MEASUREMENT_REPORT_OFFSET respectively, using the mapping table
> defined in subclause 8.1.5.4 for E-UTRAN FDD or subclause 8.1.5.5 for
> E-UTRAN TDD.
3\. Step 2 is repeated until either all positions are used or no more cells
are to be reported (because, for each RAT/mode, either XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING
cells have been reported, or there are no more valid cells to report).
The remaining positions in the measurement report shall be used for reporting
of GSM cells as defined in subclause 8.4.3.
If there are still remaining positions, these shall be used to report the next
best valid cells in supported other radio access technologies for which
XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING is non-zero. The best cell is the cell with the highest
quantity of (6 bit reported value -- XXX_REPORTING_THRESHOLD +
XXX_REPORTING_OFFSET).
If the neighbour cell list contains a UTRAN frequency for RSSI reporting, an
RSSI report on that frequency shall be included when and only when a cell on
that frequency is also reported (RSSI shall be reported at most once per
frequency occurence in the neighbouring cell list). RSSI measurements for
frequencies contained in the neighbour cell list shall be reported with high
priority and shall be reported before measurements on valid 3G cell, in case
of not available positions.
NOTE: The parameter XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING indicates a number of cells to be
reported in a measurement report message and does not include the number of
places taken by RSSI reporting in the measurement report message. In the case
of E-UTRAN there is only one parameter E-UTRAN_MULTIRAT_REPORTING that
indicates the number of cells to be reported in a measurement report message
regardless of mode.
If no measurements have been performed on a cell since last report, the cell
shall not be included in the report.
For UTRAN FDD, valid cells are identified cells where the primary CPICH has
been received when using the scrambling code provided for that frequency in
the neighbour cell list.
For UTRAN TDD, valid cells are identified cells with correct cell parameter
and sync case provided for that frequency in the neighbour cell list.
For cdma2000, valid cells are identified cells with correct Pilot PN sequence
offset index (PILOT_PN, as defined in TIA/EIA/IS-2000-A) provided for that
frequency in the neighbour cell list.
For E-UTRAN FDD, valid cells are identified cells on frequencies included in
the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list for which the physical-layer cell identity
(see 3GPP TS 36.211) has been correctly detected and is not included in the
list of not allowed cells for that frequency.
For E-UTRAN TDD, valid cells are identified cells on frequencies included in
the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list for which the physical-layer cell identity
(see 3GPP TS 36.211) has been correctly detected and is not included in the
list of not allowed cells for that frequency.
The XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING parameters are broadcast on BCCH and, except for
E-UTRAN parameters, on PBCCH. An MS attached to GPRS shall use the parameters
broadcast on PBCCH if it exists. In all other cases, the MS shall use the
parameters broadcast on BCCH. The parameters may also be sent to the MS on
SACCH.
### 8.4.8 Enhanced Measurement Reporting
The network may request the MS to report serving cell and neighbour cell
measurements with Enhanced Measurement Report message by the parameter
REPORT_TYPE, provided that BSIC for all GSM neighbour cells has been sent to
the MS (See 3GPP TS 44.018). This reporting is referred as Enhanced
Measurement Reporting.
If Enhanced Measurement Reporting is used, the BCCH carriers and corresponding
valid BSICs of the GSM neighbour cells are sent to the MS within System
Information messages and MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message (See 3GPP TS 44.018).
The MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message also includes the parameters
SERVING_BAND_REPORTING, MULTIBAND_REPORTING, XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING,
XXX_REPORTING_THRESHOLD, XXX_REPORTING_OFFSET, REP_PRIORITY, REPORTING_RATE,
INVALID_BSIC_REPORTING and optionally FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2, E-UTRAN_
FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2 and E-UTRAN_TDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2. XXX
indicates, as applicable, GSM frequency band (e.g. 900, 850, etc) or other
radio access technology/mode (e.g. FDD, TDD, E-UTRAN, E-UTRAN FDD, E-UTRAN
TDD).
Only GSM cells with the valid BSIC shall be reported unless otherwise stated.
#### 8.4.8.1 Reporting Priority
The MS shall include the neighbour cell measurement results using the
following priority order:
1) the number of strongest GSM cells with known and valid BSIC and with > a
reported value equal or greater than XXX_REPORTING_THRESHOLD, > in the
frequency band of the serving cell, according to the value > of the parameter
SERVING_BAND_REPORTING;
2) the number of strongest GSM cells with known and valid BSIC and with > a
reported value equal or greater than XXX_REPORTING_THRESHOLD, > in each of the
frequency bands in the BA list, excluding the > frequency band of the serving
cell, according to the value of the > parameter MULTIBAND_REPORTING;
3) the number of best valid cells and with a reported value equal or > greater
than XXX_REPORTING_THRESHOLD, in each supported other > radio access
technology/mode in the 3G neighbour cell list or on > frequencies contained in
the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, > according to the value of the parameters
XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING. > When the radio access technology/mode is UTRAN FDD,
then > additionally the non-reported value (from CPICH Ec/No and CPICH > RSCP)
shall be equal or greater than FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2. > When the radio
access technology/mode is E-UTRAN FDD or E‑UTRAN > TDD, then additionally the
non-reported value (from RSRP and RSRQ) > shall be equal or greater than >
E-UTRAN_FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2 or > E‑UTRAN_TDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2,
respectively. A valid cell > is defined in subclause 8.4.7.
4) The remaining GSM cells with known and valid BSIC or, if indicated > by the
parameter INVALID_BSIC_REPORTING, with known and allowed > NCC part of the
BSIC in any frequency band and valid cells of > other radio access
technologies for which XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING > is greater than zero. Except
for cells with high reporting > priority as indicated with by the parameter
REP_PRIORITY, these > cells may be reported less frequently, if indicated by
the > parameter REPORTING_RATE, but at least once in four consecutive >
measurement reports. For those cells that are not reported in > every
measurement report, the MS shall average the measurements of > the current and
the previous reporting period (i.e. over two > reporting periods).
    For UTRAN FDD cells within this priority level the non-reported
    value shall be equal or greater than FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2.
    For E-UTRAN FDD and E-UTRAN TDD cells within this priority level the
    non-reported value shall be equal or greater than
    E-UTRAN\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2 or
    E‑UTRAN\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2 respectively.
If the neighbour cell list contains a UTRAN frequency for which RSSI shall be
reported, that report shall be included whenever a cell on that frequency is
reported, as described in 8.4.7.
For each of the priority levels above, the following shall apply:
\- if the number of valid cells is less than indicated the unused positions in
the report shall be left for the lower prioritised cells;
\- if there is not enough space in the report for all valid cells, the cells
shall be reported for which the quantity (reported value --
XXX_REPORTING_THRESHOLD + XXX_REPORTING_OFFSET) is highest, where the
parameters XXX_REPORTING_THRESHOLD and XXX_REPORTING_OFFSET are for the
respective radio access technology/mode. Note that this parameter shall not
affect the actual reported value. If a cell can not be reported due to lack of
space in the report, then no cell with a lower value shall be reported, even
if one of these cells with a lower value would fit in the report.
#### 8.4.8.2 Measurement Reporting
The reporting period shall be as specified in 8.4.1 for the MS on a TCH in
_A/Gb mode_ and for the MS on a DBPSCH in _Iu mode_ , and as specified in
8.4.2 for the MS on a SDCCH.
When on a TCH in _A/Gb mode_ , or on a DBPSCH in _Iu mode_ , the MS shall
assess during the reporting period and transmit to the BSS in the next SACCH
message block the following:
\- RXLEV for neighbour cells in the order defined in 8.4.8.1. For a cell of
other radio access technology, see subclause 8.1.5.
\- RXQUAL_FULL:\ In _A/Gb mode_ , RXQUAL for the full set of TCH and SACCH
TDMA frames. The full set of TDMA frames is either 100 (i.e. 104 ‑ 4 idle)
frames for a full rate TCH or 52 frames for a half‑rate TCH. In _Iu mode_ ,
RXQUAL for the full set of TDMA frames on DBPSCH. The full set of TDMA frames
is either 100 (i.e. 104 ‑ 4 idle) frames for a full rate DBPSCH or 52 frames
for a half‑rate DBPSCH.
\- RXLEV_VAL:\ The average over the reporting period of RXLEV measured on the
4 last time slots of each fully received and correctly decoded data block (as
defined for MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP in 8.2.3.2) and on all SACCH frames. For
speech traffic channels, blocks that have not been erased, shall be considered
as correctly decoded. For non-transparent data, blocks are considered as
correctly decoded according the CRC received. For transparent data, all blocks
are considered as correctly decoded. FACCH blocks are considered as correctly
decoded according to the CRC.
\- MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP:\ The average over the reporting period of the Mean and
Coefficient of Variation of the Bit Error Probability measures from blocks as
defined for RXLEV_VAL above, excluding CV_BEP~block~ measurements from SACCH/T
blocks (see subclause 8.2.3).
\- NBR_RCVD_BLOCKS:\ The number of correctly decoded blocks, as defined for
RXLEV_VAL, (excluding all SID frames, RATSCCH, SACCH, PACCH and FACCH blocks)
that were completed during the measurement report period. As an exception,
FACCH or PACCH blocks shall be included in the case of signalling only mode.
For FLO in _Iu mode_ , the procedure for reporting the number of correctly
decoded transport blocks is defined in subclause 8.4.8.3.
NOTE: In some cases more than one data frame needs to be received in order to
identify a block as correctly decoded, e.g. for 14.4 data where one RLP frame
consists of two consecutive blocks. In some cases a single block carries
multiple RLP frames in which case it is sufficient that one of those RLP
frames is correctly received.
\- BSIC_SEEN:\ Indicates if a GSM cell with invalid BSIC and allowed NCC part
of the BSIC is one of the six strongest cells.
In case of a multislot configuration the MS shall report the following
according to the definition above:
\- on the main SACCH: the RXLEV values from the adjacent cells, BSIC_SEEN,
RXLEV_VAL and NBR_RCVD_BLOCKS from the main channel, the worst RXQUAL_FULL
value and the worst MEAN_BEP value from the main channel and the
unidirectional channels and the CV_BEP value from the same channel as the
reported MEAN_BEP;
  * on each other bi‑directional SACCH: the RXLEV values from the adjacent cells, BSIC_SEEN, RXLEV_VAL, NBR_RCVD_BLOCKS, RXQUAL_FULL, MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP from the corresponding channel.
When on a SDCCH, the MS shall assess during the reporting period and transmit
to the BSS in the next SACCH message block the following:
\- RXLEV for neighbour cells as defined in 8.4.8.1. For a cell of other radio
access technology, see subclause 8.1.5.
  * RXLEV_VAL, NBR_RCVD_BLOCKS, RXQUAL_FULL, MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP for the full set of 12 (8 SDCCH and 4 SACCH) TDMA frames within the reporting period. As DTX is not allowed on the SDCCH, measurements on all 12 TDMA frames shall be included.
\- BSIC_SEEN:\ Indicates if a GSM cell with invalid BSIC and allowed NCC part
of the BSIC is one of the six strongest cells.
The common aspects for the MS on a TCH or a SDCCH as defined in 8.4.4 shall
apply.
#### 8.4.8.3 NBR_RCVD_BLOCKS for FLO
For reporting the number of correctly decoded transport blocks during a
reporting period, the MS shall calculate the maximum number of transport
blocks that can be correctly decoded during that reporting period (NbTB~max~).
NbTB~max~ is 24 × the maximum number of active transport channels (for which a
CRC is used) in a TFC of the TFCS (excluding the signalling TFC, see 3GPP TS
44.118) of the DBPSCH. If the TFCS (excluding the signalling TFC) does not
contain a TFC for which at least one transport channel that uses a CRC is
active, NbTB~max~ becomes 24 × the maximum number of active transport channel
in a TFC of the TFCS (excluding the signalling TFC).
If during a reporting period, the TFCS is reconfigured by higher layers,
NbTB~max~ shall be the highest one among the TFCSs used during the reporting
period.
When counting the correctly decoded transport blocks, the MS shall apply the
two following principles:
\- when a radio packet is received with the signalling TFC (the first one, the
one for which the TFCI=0, see 3GPP TS 44.118), the transport block(s) it
carries is(are) not counted; and
\- transport blocks are considered as correctly decoded according the CRC
received. If there is no CRC, the transport block is not counted unless the
TFCS (excluding the signalling TFC) does not contain a TFC for which at least
one transport channel that uses a CRC is active, in which case all received
transport blocks are considered as correctly decoded.
NBR_RCVD_BLOCKS is obtained by truncating the least significant bit(s) of the
binary representation of the number of correctly decoded transport blocks
according to the table below:
Table 8.4.8.2: Truncation
* * *
NbTBmax Truncation 0 -31 none 32 -63 1 LSB > 63 2 LSB
* * *
## 8.5 Absolute MS‑BTS distance
### 8.5.1 General
The Absolute MS‑BTS distance may be employed by the network as a criterion in
the handover processes.
### 8.5.2 Physical parameter
The information being used by the BSS to perform \"adaptive frame alignment\"
(3GPP TS 45.010) in the MS is a representation of the absolute distance of the
MS to the serving BTS.
This absolute distance may be used by the BSS to prevent MS from grossly
exceeding the planned cell boundaries.
The allowable distance is administered on a cell by cell basis by the network
operator.

For an _Iu mode_ capable MS, if all the following conditions are met, then the
\"Cell selection priority\" and the \"Status for cell reselection\" shall be
set to normal (_Iu mode_):
> ‑ the cell belongs to the MS HPLMN if no EHPLMN list is available or is
> empty, or the cell belongs to any PLMN defined in the EHPLMN list;\ ‑ the MS
> is in cell test operation mode;\ ‑ the CELL_BAR_QUALIFY_3 is set to \"01\";\
> ‑ the Access Control class 15 is barred;
Otherwise, if the MS is _A/Gb mode_ capable, if all the following conditions
are met, then the \"Cell selection priority\" and the \"Status for cell
reselection\" shall be set to normal (_A/Gb mode_):
‑ the cell belongs to the MS HPLMN if no EHPLMN list is available or is empty,
or the cell belongs to any PLMN defined in the EHPLMN list;\ ‑ the MS is in
cell test operation mode;\ ‑ the CELL_BAR_ACCESS is set to \"1\";\ ‑ the
CELL_BAR_QUALIFY is set to \"0\";\ ‑ the Access Control class 15 is barred.
NOTE 1: A low priority cell is only selected if there are no suitable cells of
normal priority (see 3GPP TS 43.022).
NOTE 2: Two identical semantics are used for cross phase compatibility
reasons. This allows an operator to declare a cell always as a low priority
one for a phase 2 MS, but keeps the opportunity for an operator to decide
whether a phase 1 MS is permitted to camp on such a cell or not.
NOTE 3: void
NOTE 4: _Iu mode_ not supported.
NOTE 5: The cell is barred against the MSs supporting _Iu mode_.
NOTE 6: _Iu mode_ supported and the _Iu mode_ capable MS shall access _Iu
mode_.
NOTE 7: In case an optional parameter is not included in a point-to-point
signalling message, the default value of that parameter shall replace any
previously broadcast value, where applicable.

# 10 GPRS mode tasks
## 10.1 Cell Re-selection
In _A/Gb mode_ , in GMM Standby and GMM Ready states, cell re-selection is
performed by the MS, except when the MS has an ongoing circuit switched
connection (e.g. while in dual transfer mode), in which case the cell is
determined by the network according to the handover procedures (see subclause
3). When the circuit switched connection is released, the MS shall resume cell
re-selection (see subclause 6.7.1).
In _Iu mode_ , in RRC-Idle and RRC-Connected modes, cell re-selection is
performed by the MS, except while in RRC-Cell_Dedicated state, in which case
the cell is determined by the network according to the handover procedures
(see subclause 3). When the MS leaves the RRC-Cell_Dedicated state, the MS
shall resume cell re-selection (see subclause 6.7.1).
The cell re-selection procedures defined in subclauses 10.1.1 to 10.1.3 apply
in _A/Gb mode_ to the MSs attached to GPRS if a PBCCH exists in the serving
cell. In _Iu mode_ these procedures apply always.
In _A/Gb mode,_ if PBCCH does not exist, the criteria and algorithms defined
in subclauses 10.1.2 and 10.1.3 shall also apply if one or more cells are
provided to the MS in a Packet Cell Change Order or Packet Measurement Order
message (3GPP TS 44.060). In this case, the MS shall convert the idle mode
cell re-selection parameters, received for the other cells according to clause
6, to GPRS cell re-selection parameters according to table 3a and use the same
procedures, except that the MS may measure received signal strength in packet
idle mode according to either subclause 6.6.1 or subclause 10.1.1.
Otherwise the MS shall perform cell re-selection according to the idle mode
procedures defined in clause 6, except that the MS is only required to monitor
full system information on BCCH of the serving cell if indicated by change
mark on BCCH or PACCH. If PBCCH exists, the MS is not required to monitor
system information on BCCH of the serving cell or any system information of
the non-serving cells and only required to monitor system information on PBCCH
of the serving cell if indicated by change mark on PBCCH, PCCCH or PACCH.
For both cases (with or without PBCCH), the details of system information
monitoring are specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 and 3GPP TS 44.160.
In packet transfer mode, broadcast/multicast receive mode or MAC-Shared state,
the MS shall always measure received signal strength according to subclause
10.1.1.
The cells to be monitored for cell re-selection are defined in the BA(GPRS)
list, which is broadcast on PBCCH. If PBCCH does not exist, BA(GPRS) is equal
to BA(BCCH).
In addition, the network may control the cell selection as defined in
subclause 10.1.4.
For a multi-RAT MS, cell re-selection to other radio access technologies shall
also be possible. If PBCCH exists, the procedures in subclause 10.1.1.3,
10.1.3.2 and 10.1.3.3 shall apply. In _A/Gb mode_ , if PBCCH does not exist,
the criteria and algorithms defined in subclauses 10.1.1.3, 10.1.3.2 and
10.1.3.3 shall also apply if GPRS cell re-selection parameters for one or more
cells are provided to the MS in a Packet Cell Change Order or Packet
Measurement Order message; otherwise the idle mode procedures in subclause 6
shall apply.
### 10.1.1 Monitoring the received signal level and PBCCH data
The MS shall measure the received RF signal level on the BCCH carriers of the
serving cell and the surrounding cells as indicated in the BA(GPRS) list and
optionally the NC_FREQUENCY_LIST, and calculate the received level average
(RLA_P) for each carrier.
In addition the MS shall verify the BSIC of the BCCH carriers. Only cells with
allowed BSIC shall be considered for re-selection. The allowed BSIC is either
a valid BSIC or, for cells in BA(BCCH) where no BSIC is broadcast, a BSIC with
allowed NCC part (see subclause 7.2). A valid BSIC is a BSIC broadcast for
that carrier in the BA(GPRS) list.
In addition to what is described in subclauses 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2, an MS
supporting SoLSA with SoLSA subscription shall attempt to decode BSIC for the
6 strongest carriers, with LSA IDs to which the MS subscribes. At least one
carrier shall be searched every 5 minutes, one after another. In the case the
MS has been able to decode the BSIC, the rules described in 10.1.3 shall be
followed. The LSA IDs of the carriers are broadcast on PBCCH of the serving
cell.
#### 10.1.1.1 Packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state
Whilst in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state an MS shall continuously monitor
all BCCH carriers as indicated by the BA(GPRS) list and the BCCH carrier of
the serving cell. At least one received signal level measurement sample on
each BCCH carrier shall be taken for each paging block monitored by the MS
according to its current DRX mode and its paging group. As the minimum MS
shall take one measurement for each BCCH carrier for every 4 second. As the
maximum, the MS is however not required to take more than 1 sample per second
for each BCCH carrier.
RLA_P shall be a running average determined using samples collected over a
period of 5 s to Max {5s, five consecutive paging blocks of that MS}, and
shall be maintained for each BCCH carrier. The same number of measurement
samples shall be taken for all BCCH carriers, and the samples allocated to
each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly distributed over the
evaluation period. At least 5 received signal level measurement samples are
required for a valid RLA_P value.
The list of the 6 strongest non‑serving carriers shall be updated at a rate of
at least once per running average period.
The MS shall attempt to check the BSIC for each of the 6 strongest non‑serving
cell BCCH carriers at least every 14 consecutive paging blocks of that MS or
10 seconds, whichever is greater. If a change of BSIC is detected then the
carrier shall be treated as a new carrier.
In the case of a multiband MS, the MS shall attempt to decode the BSIC, if any
BCCH carrier with unknown BSIC is detected among the number of strongest BCCH
carriers in each band as indicated by the parameter MULTIBAND_REPORTING (see
subclause 8.4.3), broadcast on PBCCH, or if PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH.
When requested by the user, the MS shall determine which PLMNs are available
as described in subclause 6.6.1. However, for MSs without DRX or with short
DRX period (see 3GPP TS 45.002), considerable interruptions to the monitoring
of PPCH or PCH can not be avoided.
When PBCCH is not present in the serving cell and the network controlled cell
reselection mode (see subclause 10.1.4) is not set to NC2, the MS shall follow
the procedures specified in section 6.6.1 for the acquisition and periodic
verification of the parameters affecting cell reselection for the non-serving
cells.
#### 10.1.1.2 Packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state
Whilst in packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state an MS shall continuously
monitor all BCCH carriers as indicated by the BA(GPRS) list and the BCCH
carrier of the serving cell. In every TDMA frame, a received signal level
measurement sample shall be taken on at least one of the BCCH carriers, one
after the other. Optionally, measurements during up to 8 TDMA frames per PDCH
multiframe may be omitted if required for BSIC decoding or multi-RAT
measurements.
RLA_P shall be a running average determined using samples collected over a
period of 5 s, and shall be maintained for each BCCH carrier. The same number
of measurement samples shall be taken for all BCCH carriers except, if the
parameter PC_MEAS_CHAN indicates that the power control measurements shall be
made on BCCH (see subclause 10.2.3.1.2), for the serving cell where at least 6
measurement samples shall be taken per 52-multiframe. The samples allocated to
each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly distributed over the
evaluation period. At least 5 received signal level measurement samples are
required for a valid RLA_P value.
In some allowed multislot configurations (see 3GPP TS 45.002) the MS is not
able to perform normal received signal level measurements within the TDMA
frame. In this case, the MS shall perform the measurements whenever possible
according to its measurement capability (see 3GPP TS 45.002). For downlink
packet transfer using any medium access mode (see 3GPP TS 44.060), the MS
shall perform the measurements during the block period where the polling
response is sent (T~ra~ shall apply).
NOTE 1: The network is responsible for providing the necessary opportunities
to ensure that the MS will perform the required number of measurements.
The MS shall attempt to check the BSIC for as many non‑serving cell BCCH
carriers as possible and as often as possible, and at least every 10 seconds.
A multi-RAT MS is allowed to extend this period to 13 seconds, if the
neighbour cell list contains cells or frequencies from other RATs. The MS
shall use the two Idle frames of the PDCH multiframe for this purpose. These
frames are termed "search" frames. A list containing BSIC and timing
information for these strongest carriers at the accuracy required for
accessing a cell (see 3GPP TS 45.010) including the absolute times derived
from the parameters T1, T2, T3 shall be kept by the MS. This information may
be used to schedule the decoding of BSIC and shall be used when re-selecting a
new cell in order to keep the switching time at a minimum. When a BCCH carrier
is found to be no longer among the reported, BSIC and timing information shall
be retained for 10 seconds. (This is in case a cell re-selection command to
this cell is received just after the MS has stopped reporting that cell, see
subclause 10.1.4.2).
In some allowed multislot configurations (see 3GPP TS 45.002) the MS is not
able to perform BSIC decoding or multi-RAT measurements. In this case, except
when the MS performs FCCH search or when the SCH burst falls into the
available search window, the MS may:
(a) either skip the last transmission burst in the frame immediately preceding
the idle frame;
(b) or skip the first reception burst in the frame immediately following the
idle frame;
(c) or delay the transmission of an (E)GPRS RLC/MAC block for data transfer
occurring in the radio block period whose last timeslot allocated for such
block immediately precedes the idle frame to next available uplink radio block
period and in this case the MS may not perform transmission on that timeslot
in the block period;
in order to comply to the requirement to verify and decode BSIC information,
or in order to perform multi-RAT measurements.
If, after averaging measurement results over 4 PDCH multiframes (1 sec), the
MS detects one or more BCCH carriers, among the 6 strongest, whose BSICs are
not currently being assessed, then the MS shall as a matter of priority
attempt to decode their BSICs.
In the case of a multiband MS, the MS shall attempt to decode the BSIC, if any
BCCH carrier with unknown BSIC is detected among the number of strongest BCCH
carriers in each band as indicated by the parameter MULTIBAND_REPORTING (see
subclause 8.4.3), broadcast on PBCCH, or if PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH.
Thus an MS shall, for a period of up to 5 seconds, devote all search frames to
attempting to decode these BSICs. If this fails then the MS shall return to
confirming existing BSICs. Having re‑confirmed existing BSICs, if there are
still BCCH carriers, among the six strongest, with unknown BSICs, then the
decoding of these shall again be given priority for a further period of up to
5 seconds.
The MS shall be able to send the first packet random access (PRACH) at the
latest 5+x seconds after a new strongest cell (which is part of the BA(GPRS))
has been activated under the following network conditions: Initial serving
cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then the new BCCH
carrier is switched on at RXLEV= -60 dBm. x is the longest time it may take to
receive the necessary system information on PBCCH in the new cell.
Note: Because of test equipment limitations it is acceptable to activate the
new carrier to replace one of the 6 neighbours.
If either no BSIC can be decoded on a surrounding cell BCCH carrier, or the
BSIC is not allowed, then the received signal level measurements on that
channel shall be discarded and the MS shall continue to monitor that channel.
If a change of BSIC is detected on a carrier, then any existing received
signal level measurement shall be discarded and the carrier shall be treated
as a new carrier.
If the BSIC cannot be decoded at the next available opportunities re‑attempts
shall be made to decode this BSIC. If the BSIC is not decoded for more than
three successive attempts it will be considered lost and any existing received
signal level measurement shall be discarded and the MS shall continue to
monitor that carrier.
When PBCCH is not present in the serving cell and the network controlled cell
reselection mode (see subclause 10.1.4) is not set to NC2, the MS shall follow
the procedures specified in section 6.6.1 for the acquisition and periodic
verification of the parameters affecting cell reselection for the non-serving
cells.
#### 10.1.1.2a Broadcast/multicast receive mode
Whilst in broadcast/multicast receive mode, an MS shall continuously monitor
all BCCH carriers as indicated by the BA(GPRS) list and the BCCH carrier of
the serving cell. In every TDMA frame, a received signal level measurement
sample shall be taken on at least one of the BCCH carriers, one after the
other. Optionally, measurements during up to 8 TDMA frames per PDCH multiframe
may be omitted if required for BSIC decoding or multi-RAT measurements.
Measurements may also be omitted in the TDMA frames where the MS is required
to monitor a system information block or a paging block. For this task,
minimum performance requirements as for packet idle mode shall apply (see
subclause 10.1.1.1).
NOTE: It is expected that in all multislot configurations allowed for MBMS
(see 3GPP TS 45.002) the MS is able to perform normal received signal level
measurements within the TDMA frame. Hence, no interruption of the reception is
required for this purpose.
The MS shall additionally attempt to check the BSIC for non-serving cell BCCH
carriers and, in case of a multi-RAT MS, perform measurements on neighbour
cells from other RATs using the search frames. For these tasks, performance
requirements as for packet transfer mode shall apply (see subclause 10.1.1.2
and subclause 10.1.1.3).
When the PBCCH is not present in the serving cell, the MS shall not attempt to
decode the BCCH data block that contains the parameters affecting cell
reselection as described in section 6.6.1 for non-serving cells that have been
provided by the System Information message received from the serving cell.
Instead, this information shall be provided by the network on PACCH or on BCCH
(see 3GPP TS 44.060 and 3GPP TS 44.018).
#### 10.1.1.3 Monitoring cells of other radio access technologies
For a multi-RAT MS, cells or frequencies with other radio access technologies
(excluding E-UTRA) may also be included in the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list
to be monitored (see 3GPP TS 44.060). This list may be modified by Packet
Measurement Order or Packet Cell Change Order messages (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
If cell reselection based on ranking is used, the network controls the
measurements for reselection of those cells by the parameter Qsearch_P
optionally broadcast on PBCCH or on BCCH if PBCCH does not exist. Qsearch_P
defines a threshold and also indicates whether these measurements shall be
performed when RLA_P of the serving cell is below or above the threshold.
For a multi-RAT MS supporting E-UTRA, E-UTRA frequencies may be included in
the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list to be monitored (see 3GPP TS 44.060). This
list may be modified by the Packet Measurement Order message (see 3GPP TS
44.060). The network controls the measurements for reselection of E-UTRA cells
by the parameter THRESH_priority_search broadcast on BCCH. This parameter also
controls measurement of inter-RAT cells or frequencies included in the GPRS 3G
Cell Reselection list when the inter-RAT cell reselection algorithm based on
priority information is used (see subclause 10.1.3.3). The mobile station
shall monitor cells of inter-RAT frequencies of higher priority than the
serving cell. When RLA_P of the serving cell is below THRESH_priority_search,
the mobile station shall monitor cells of inter-RAT frequencies of lower
priority than the serving cell. When RLA_P (see subclause 10.1.1.3) of the
serving cell is above the threshold, the mobile station is allowed not to
monitor cells of inter-RAT frequencies of lower priority than the serving
cell.
For this monitoring, the MS may use search frames that are not required for
BSIC decoding or interference measurements in packet transfer mode or MAC-
Shared state. The MS may use up to 25 search frames per 13 seconds without
considering the need for BSIC decoding or packet transfer mode / MAC-Shared
state interference measurements in these frames.
Both valid cells as defined in subclause 8.4.7, and any identified cell on a
frequency for which not full identification is included in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list, shall be considered for re-selection.
In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, a UTRAN capable MS shall be able
to send the first access at the latest 10+x seconds (in case of cell
reselection based on cell ranking) or 5+T_reselection+x seconds (in case of
cell reselection based on priority information, if the UTRAN frequency has
lower priority than the serving cell and if RLA_P of the serving cell is below
THRESH_priority_search) after a new best UTRAN cell, which is part of the GPRS
3G Cell Reselection list, has been activated under the condition that there is
only one UTRAN frequency in the list (and no E-UTRAN frequencies in the
E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list) and that no new GSM cells are activated at the
same time and under good radio conditions. x is the longest time it may take
to receive the necessary system information in the new cell. As an exception,
the time is increased to 65+T_reselection+x seconds in case of a UTRAN capable
MS performing cell reselection based on priority information (see subclause
10.1.3.3) if the UTRAN frequency has higher priority than the serving cell. A
E-UTRAN capable MS that supports autonomous cell reselection to E-UTRAN in
packet transfer mode shall be able to send the first access at the latest
5+T_reselection+x seconds after a new best E-UTRAN cell on a frequency, which
is part of the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, has been activated if the
frequency has lower priority than the serving cell and if RLA_P of the serving
cell is below THRESH_priority_search, or within 65+T_reselection+x seconds
after it has been activated if the frequency has higher priority than the
serving cell, under the condition that there is only one E-UTRAN frequency in
the list (and no UTRAN frequencies in the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list) and
that no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good radio
conditions. For test purposes the following radio conditions can be used:
Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm.
Then either an UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an UTRAN TDD neighbour cell or an
E-UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN TDD neighbour cell is switched on.
The radio conditions for the UTRAN FDD cell are as follows (see 3GPP TS 25.101
for definitions):
* * *

NOTE: The parameters in the table above are valid only for cell reselection
based on cell ranking.
The radio conditions for the UTRAN TDD cell (either 3.84 Mcps TDD option or

The allowed access time is increased
\- by 5 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list and by the time required for BSIC decoding of new activated
GSM cells when the reselection algorithm based on ranking is used, or
\- by 5 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of lower priority in the
GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on priority
information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency of lower priority
in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list and by the time required for BSIC decoding
of new activated GSM cells under the condition that RLA_P of the serving cell
is below THRESH_priority_search, or
\- by 70 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of higher priority in the
GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on priority
information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency of higher
priority in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list and by the time required for BSIC
decoding of new activated GSM cells.
However, multiple UTRAN cells on the same frequency in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list does not increase the allowed access time.
NOTE: The requirements above assume that only one of the frequencies in the
GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list or in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list is
switched on.
In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, for some allowed multislot
configurations (see 3GPP TS 45.002), identification of a UTRAN TDD cell may
not be guaranteed. In such cases, the MS may not be able to fulfil the
requirement above. If after 5 seconds the MS has not been able to identify a
UTRAN TDD cell, the MS is allowed to stop searching for it in the current GSM
cell.
In packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, a UTRAN capable MS shall be able to
identify and select a new best UTRAN cell on a frequency, which is part of the
GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list, within 30 seconds (in case of cell reselection
based on cell ranking) or 25+T_reselection seconds (in case of cell
reselection based on priority information, if the UTRAN frequency has lower
priority than the serving cell and if RLA_P of the serving cell is below
THRESH_priority_search) after it has been activated under the condition that
there is only one UTRAN frequency in the list (and no E-UTRAN frequencies in
the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list) and that no new GSM cells are activated at
the same time and under good radio conditions. As an exception, the time is
increased to 70+T_reselection seconds in case of a UTRAN capable MS performing
cell reselection based on priority information (see subclause 10.1.3.3) if the
UTRAN frequency has higher priority than the serving cell. A E-UTRAN capable
MS shall be able to identify and select a new best E-UTRAN cell on a
frequency, which is part of the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, within
25+T_reselection seconds after it has been activated if the frequency has
lower priority than the serving cell and if RLA_P of the serving cell is below
THRESH_priority_search, or within 70+T_reselection seconds after it has been
activated if the frequency has higher priority than the serving cell under the
condition that there is only one E-UTRAN frequency in the list (and no UTRAN
frequencies in the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list) and that no new GSM cells
are activated at the same time and under good radio conditions. For test
purposes the same radio conditions as for packet transfer can be used. The
allowed time is increased
\- by 30 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on ranking is used, or
\- by 30 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of lower priority in the
GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on priority
information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency of lower priority
in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list under the condition that RLA_P of the
serving cell is below THRESH_priority_search, or
\- by 70 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of higher priority in the
GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on priority
information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency of higher
priority in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.
However, multiple UTRAN cells on the same frequency in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list does not increase the allowed time.
NOTE: The requirements above assume that only one of the frequencies in the
GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list or in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list is
switched on.
A multi-RAT MS shall be able to monitor cells from other radio access
technologies, divided into (depending on the MS capability):
\- UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD frequencies, with a maximum of 32 cells per
frequency; and/or\ \- UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies, with a
maximum of 32 cells per frequency; and/or\ \- E-UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD
frequencies; and/or\ \- E-UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies.
The total number of monitored UTRAN cells shall not exceed 64.
In packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the MS shall attempt to read and store
UTRAN predefined configurations as specified for idle mode in subclause 6.6.4.
### 10.1.2 Cell Re-selection Criteria
The following cell re-selection criteria are used for GPRS and _Iu mode_ ,
whereby (s) denotes the serving cell, and (n~i~) denotes the neighbour cells.
Different parameter values may apply for each neighbour cell. One set of
parameters is broadcast in each cell.
1) The path loss criterion parameter C1 is used as a minimum signal level
criterion for cell re-selection for GPRS and _Iu mode_ in the same way as for
GSM Idle mode. C1 is the same as defined in subclause 6.4, except that
A = RLA_P ‑ GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN\ B = GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH ‑ P
The parameters GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN and GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH for the serving
cell and neighbour cells are broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell (POWER
OFFSET is not used).
> While these two parameters have not been received (because the PSI3
> information element has not been decoded) default parameters shall be used
> to calculate C1.
>
> While GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN is not available, the MS shall use the
> RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN parameter.\ While GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH is not available,
> the MS shall use the MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH parameter.
>
> All values are expressed in dBm.
2) The signal level threshold criterion parameter C31 for hierarchical cell
structures (HCS) is used to determine whether prioritised hierarchical GPRS
and LSA cell re-selection shall apply and is defined by:
C31(s) = RLA_P(s) - HCS_THR(s) (serving cell)\ C31(n) = RLA_P(n) - HCS_THR(n)
- TO(n) * L(n) (neighbour cell)
where HCS_THR is the signal threshold for applying HCS GPRS and LSA re-
selection. HCS_THR is broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell. If HCS_THR(s) is
not broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell, HCS_THR(s) and HCS_THR(n) shall be
assumed as infinity.
3) The cell ranking criterion parameter (C32) is used to select cells among
those with the same priority and is defined by:
C32(s) = C1(s) (serving cell)\ C32(n) = C1(n) + GPRS_RESELECT_OFFSET(n) -
TO(n) * (1-L(n)) (neighbour cell)\ where
GPRS_RESELECT_OFFSET applies an offset and hysteresis value to each cell
TO(n) = GPRS_TEMPORARY_OFFSET(n) * H(GPRS_PENALTY_TIME(n) - T(n)).
L(n) = 0 if PRIORITY_CLASS(n) = PRIORITY_CLASS(s)\ 1 if PRIORITY_CLASS(n) ≠
PRIORITY_CLASS(s)\ In case PRIORITY_CLASS is undefined, L(n) = 0.
H(x) = 0 for x \ \- Ec/No and RSCP are the measured quantities, se subclause 8.1.5.
  * FDD_RSCP_threshold equals FDD_RSCPmin -- min((P_MAX -- 21 dBm), 3 dB) if FDD_RSCPmin is broadcast on the serving cell, else Qrxlevmin + Pcompensation + 10 dB, if these parameters are available, otherwise the default value of FDD_RSCPmin.
  * Qrxlevmin is the minimum required RX level in the UTRAN FDD cell (dBm), see 3GPP TS 25.304.
  * Pcompensation is max(UE_TXPWR_MAX_RACH -- P_MAX, 0) (dB), see 3GPP TS 25.304.
  * UE_TXPWR_MAX_RACH is the maximum TX power level an MS may use when accessing the UTRAN FDD cell on RACH (dBm), see 3GPP TS 25.304.
  * P_MAX is the maximum RF output power of the MS (dBm) in UTRAN FDD mode, see 3GPP TS 25.304.
  * FDD_Qmin, FDD_GPRS_Qoffset and optionally FDD_RSCPmin and FDD_Qmin_Offset are broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell.
  * TDD_GPRS_Qoffset is broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell.
Note 1: The parameters required to determine if the UTRAN cell is suitable are
broadcast on BCCH of the UTRAN cell. An MS may start reselection towards the
UTRAN cell before decoding the BCCH of the UTRAN cell, leading to a short
interruption of service if the UTRAN cell is not suitable.
Note 2: If FDD_RSCPmin is broadcast, optimum GSM to UTRAN reselection
performance is achieved if UTRAN cells at UTRAN coverage border areas are
planned for +24 dBm UE power.
Note 3: The parameter TDD_Qoffset is an absolute threshold for reselection
towards a target UTRAN TDD cell.
The MS shall store the UTRAN cell RSCP suitability criterion parameters above,
whenever decoded from a UTRAN FDD cell of an equivalent PLMN while attempting
to camp on the UTRAN FDD cell. The most recently decoded parameters from one
UTRAN FDD cell of an equivalent PLMN are valid reselection criteria towards
all UTRAN FDD cells. This list of parameters shall be cleared after PLMN
selection (see 3GPP TS 23.122).
Cell reselection to UTRAN shall not occur within 5 seconds after the MS has
reselected a GSM cell from an UTRAN cell if a suitable GSM cell can be found.
In case of a reselection attempt towards a barred UTRAN cell, the MS shall
abandon further reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell as defined by the
T~barred~ value on the barred UTRAN cell (see 3GPP TS 25.331).
In case the highest ranked UTRAN cell is not suitable (see 3GPP TS 25.304) due
to being part of the \"list of forbidden LAs for roaming\" or belonging to a
PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN, the MS
may abandon further reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell and all other
cells on the same frequency, for a period of up to 20 min. If the MS has to
perform cell selection, this limitation shall be removed. If the MS is
redirected under GERAN control to a frequency for which the timer is running,
any limitation on that frequency shall be removed.
If more than one UTRAN cell fulfils the above criteria, the MS shall select
the cell with the greatest RSCP value.
#### 10.1.3.3 Algorithm for inter-RAT cell re-selection based on priority
information
This algorithm and its applicability are as specified in sub-clause 6.6.6.
#### 10.1.3.4 Cell selection and re-selection to CSG cells
If a mobile station is a member of at least one Closed Subscriber Group, i.e.
at least one CSG ID and its PLMN ID is included in the MS's \"A**llowed CSG**
**list** \"**, then,** in addition to normal cell reselection, the MS shall
use an autonomous search function to detect UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN CSG cells.
The autonomous search function shall at least detect previously visited
allowed CSG cells.
NOTE: The MS does not perform autonomous cell reselection to CSG cells in
packet transfer mode if NC2 mode is configured.
Measurement of CSG cells and cell re-selection to CSG cells in packet idle
mode shall follow the same rules as in subclause 6.6.7.1. Manual search and
selection of CSG ID(s) in packet idle mode shall follow the same rules as in
subclause 6.6.7.2.
The MS is not required to consider CSG cells for measurement and cell re-
selection while in packet transfer mode. If the MS performs cell reselection
to a CSG cell in packet transfer mode, it shall follow the same rules as in
subclause 6.6.7.1 (the performance requirements for the autonomous search and
cell re-selection to a previously visited allowed CSG cell shall not apply in
packet transfer mode).
The MS is not required to perform manual search and selection of CSG ID(s)
while in packet transfer mode.
### 10.1.4 Network controlled Cell re-selection
The network may request measurement reports from the MS and control its cell
re‑selection. This is indicated by the parameter NETWORK_CONTROL_ORDER. The
meaning of the different parameter values is specified as follows:
NC0 Normal MS control\ The MS shall perform autonomous cell re-selection.
NC1 MS control with measurement reports\ The MS shall send measurement reports
to the network as defined in subclause 10.1.4.1.\ The MS shall perform
autonomous cell re-selection.
NC2 Network control\ The MS shall send measurement reports to the network as
defined in subclause 10.1.4.1.\ The MS shall only perform autonomous cell re-
selection when the reselection is triggered by a downlink signalling failure
as defined in subclause 6.5 or a random access failure as defined in 3GPP TS
44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060 or if the cell is barred or the C1 criterion falls
below zero. The MS shall only determine whether the cell is barred once camped
on the cell.
RESET The MS shall return to the broadcast parameters. Only sent on PCCCH or
PACCH.
The parameter values NC1 and NC2 only apply in GMM Ready state (_A/Gb mode_)
or RRC-Cell_Shared state (_Iu mode_). In GMM Standby state (_A/Gb mode_) or
RRC-Idle mode or RRC-GRA_PCH state (_Iu mode)_ , the MS shall always use
normal MS control independent of the ordered NC mode.
While in broadcast/multicast receive mode, the MS shall operate in Network
Control mode NC0 even if it had been ordered otherwise by the network. If in
GMM Ready state, the mobile station shall move to NC0 upon entering
broadcast/multicast receive mode. When returning to packet idle mode, the
mobile station shall revert to the control mode ordered by the network before
entering broadcast/multicast receive mode if the mobile station is still in
GMM Ready state. If leaving broadcast/multicast receive mode to enter packet
transfer mode, the MS shall apply the network control mode commanded by the
network in the system information.
A set of measurement reporting parameters (NETWORK_CONTROL_ORDER,
NC_REPORTING_PERIOD(s) and optionally REPORT_TYPE, MULTIBAND_REPORTING,
SERVING_BAND_REPORTING, XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING, XXX_REPORTING_OFFSET,
XXX_REPORTING_THRESHOLD, FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2, REP_PRIORITY,
REPORTING_RATE, INVALID_BSIC_REPORTING, SCALE_ORD, FDD_REP_QUANT, Qsearch_P,
E-UTRAN_REP_QUANT, E-UTRAN_FDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2,
E-UTRAN_TDD_REPORTING_THRESHOLD_2, E-UTRAN_FDD_MEASUREMENT_REPORT_OFFSET,
E-UTRAN_TDD_MEASUREMENT_REPORT_OFFSET, Qsearch_P_E-UTRAN) is broadcast on BCCH
and, excepting E-UTRAN parameters, on PBCCH if it exists. XXX indicates, as
applicable, GSM frequency band (e.g. 900, 850, etc) or other radio access
technology/mode (e.g. FDD, TDD, E-UTRAN, E-UTRAN FDD, E-UTRAN TDD). This set
of parameters may also be sent individually to an MS on PACCH or, excepting
E-UTRAN parameters, on PCCCH in :
> \- a PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER message, in which case it overrides the NC
> parameters broadcast in the serving cell. These individual parameters are
> only valid in the serving cell.
>
> \- a PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message, in which case it overrides the NC
> parameters broadcast in the target cell. These individual parameters are
> only valid in the target cell.
The individual parameters are valid until the RESET command is sent to the MS
or there is a downlink signalling failure or a random access failure or if the
cell is barred or the C1 criterion falls below zero or the MS goes to the GMM
Standby state (_A/Gb mode_) or RRC-Idle mode or RRC-GRA_PCH state (_Iu mode_)
or MS enters dedicated mode (_A/Gb mode_) or RRC-Cell_Dedicated state (_Iu
mode_). Before the MS has acquired NC parameters when entering a new cell, the
MS shall assume mode NC0 unless NC0, NC1 or NC2 mode was explicitly commanded
by a PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message in the previous cell.
A parameter NC_FREQUENCY_LIST may also be sent individually to an MS on PCCCH
or PACCH. This list adds/deletes frequencies to the BA(GPRS) both for cell re-
selection and for measurement reports. The NC_FREQUENCY_LIST and the
REP_PRIORITY are valid until an empty NC_FREQUENCY_LIST is sent to the MS,
there is a downlink signalling failure or the MS selects a new cell or the
BA(GPRS) that is modified by the NC_FREQUENCY_LIST changes or MS enters
dedicated mode (_A/Gb mode_) or RRC-Cell_Dedicated state (_Iu mode_).
The same considerations regarding validity apply to lists that include cells
with other radio access technologies.
A list given by Packet Cell Change Order applies in the new cell. This list
may also include cells with other radio access technologies.
If the MS operates in NC1 or NC2 modes, the network may control UTRAN
measurements per individual UTRAN frequency by the parameters
Measurement_Control_UTRAN and E-UTRAN measurements per individual E‑UTRAN
frequency by the parameters Measurement_Control_E-UTRAN. In NC1 mode, cell
reselection requirements shall have priority over reporting requirements. An
MS operating in NC1 mode is not required to report a cell if the MS is not
monitoring that cell for the purpose of cell reselection.
All signalling for support of network controlled cell re-selection and
measurement reports are defined in 3GPP TS 44.060.
#### 10.1.4.1 Measurement reporting
When ordered to send measurement reports, the MS shall continuously monitor
all carriers in BA(GPRS) or as indicated by the parameter NC_FREQUENCY_LIST
and the BCCH carrier of the serving cell. The measurement requirements are
defined in subclause 10.1.1 for the actual packet mode.
For each carrier, the measured received signal level (RXLEV) shall be the
average of the received signal level measurement samples in dBm taken on that
carrier within the reporting period. The reporting period is defined as
follows:
\- in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the reporting period is
NC_REPORTING_PERIOD_I rounded off to the nearest smaller integer multiple of
DRX period if NC_REPORTING PERIOD_I is greater than DRX period, else, the
reporting period is DRX period;
\- in packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, the reporting period is
indicated in NC_REPORTING_PERIOD_T.
In averaging, measurements made during previous reporting periods shall always
be discarded. The start of the first reporting period may be random.
After each reporting period, the MS shall send a measurement report to BSS
(see 3GPP TS 44.060). The MS shall then discard any previous measurement
report, which it has not been able to send. Provided that the MS has received
BSIC for all GSM neighbour cells, the parameter REPORT_TYPE indicates if the
MS shall use Packet Measurement Report (normal reporting) or Packet Enhanced
Measurement Report (enhanced reporting) (see 3GPP TS 44.060). The measurement
report shall contain:
\- RXLEV for the serving cell;
\- received signal level for the non-serving cells:
  * For normal measurement reporting, carriers shall be reported if they are among the 6 strongest carriers and BSIC is successfully decoded and allowed (see subclause 10.1.1), i.e. either equal to the BSIC of the list or with allowed NCC part of BSIC. In the latter case, which applies for BA(BCCH) where no BSIC is given, the decoded BSIC shall be included in the report. If the mobile station has acquired the GSM Neighbour Cell list (see 3GPP TS 44.060), only cells present in that list shall be included in the report. In the case of a multiband MS, the MS shall report the number of strongest BCCH carriers in each band as indicated by the parameter MULTIBAND_REPORTING (see subclause 8.4.3), broadcast on PBCCH, or if PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH. For multi-RAT MS, the MS shall report the number of best valid cells in each other radio access technology/mode as indicated by the parameters XXX_MULTIRAT_REPORTING, see subclause 8.4.7. In this case, the received signal level is replaced by the relevant measurement quantity (see subclause 8.1.5). Valid cells are defined in subclause 8.4.7;
  * For Enhanced Measurement Reporting, cells shall be reported if they are among the at least 6 strongest carriers, and BSIC is successfully decoded and valid (see subclause 10.1.1) or, if indicated by the parameter INVALID_BSIC_REPORTING, with known and allowed NCC part. The neighbour cells shall be reported according to the priority defined in subclause 8.4.8.1. For other radio access technology/mode, RXLEV is replaced by the relevant measurement quantity (see subclause 8.1.5);
\- BSIC_SEEN (only for Enhanced Measurement Reporting).\ Indicates if a GSM
cell with invalid BSIC and allowed NCC part of the BSIC is one of the six
strongest cells.
In the case of Packet Transfer mode or MAC-Shared state with the
NC_REPORTING_PERIOD_T = 0.48 s the MS shall report a new strongest GSM cell in
the measurement report at the latest 5 s after a new strongest cell (which is
part of the BA(GPRS)) has been activated under the following network
conditions: Initial serving cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 neighbours at
RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then the new BCCH carrier is switched on at RXLEV= -60 dBm.
NOTE: Because of test equipment limitations it is acceptable to activate the
new carrier to replace one of the 6 neighbours.
A UTRAN capable MS shall report a new best UTRAN cell, which is part of the
neighbour cell list, at the latest 5 seconds after it has been activated under
the condition that there is only one UTRAN frequency in the neighbour cell
list (and no E-UTRAN frequencies in the neighbour cell list) and that no new
GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good radio conditions. A
E-UTRAN capable MS that supports measurement reporting of E-UTRAN cells shall
report a new best E-UTRAN cell, on a frequency contained in the E-UTRAN
Neighbour Cell list, at the latest 5 seconds after it has been activated under
the condition that there is only one E-UTRAN frequency in theE-UTRAN Neighbour
Cell list (and no UTRAN frequencies in the 3G Neighbour Cell list) and that no
new GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good radio conditions.
For test purposes the following radio conditions can be used:
Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm.
Then either an UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an UTRAN TDD neighbour cell or an
E-UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN TDD neighbour cell is switched on.
The radio conditions for the UTRAN FDD cells are as follows (see 3GPP TS
25.101 for definitions):
* * *

The radio conditions for the UTRAN TDD cell (either 3.84 Mcps TDD option or

The allowed reporting time is increased by 5 seconds for each additional UTRAN
frequency in the neighbour cell list or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency
in the neighbour cell list and by the time required for BSIC decoding of new
activated GSM cells. However, multiple UTRAN cells on the same frequency in
the neighbour cell list does not increase the allowed reporting time.
NOTE: The requirements above assume that only one UTRAN or E-UTRAN frequency
is switched on.
In case a cell is abandoned for cell reselection attempts due to being part of
the "list of forbidden LAs for roaming" (for UTRAN cells) or part of the "list
of forbidden TAs for roaming" (for E-UTRAN cells), or belonging to a PLMN
which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN, as defined
in subclause 10.1.3.2 and in subclause 10.1.3.3, the MS may abandon monitoring
and reporting this UTRAN or E-UTRAN cell and all other cells on the same
frequency for the same period of time that reselection attempts are abandoned.
If the MS has received the PCID to TA Mapping information element for the
E-UTRAN frequency of the cell (see 3GPP TS 44.060), the MS may abandon, for
the same period of time that reselection attempts are abandoned, monitoring
and reporting this E-UTRAN cell and any E-UTRAN cell which known to belong to
the same Tracking Area.
NOTE: Monitoring and reporting of E-UTRAN cells whose PCID does not belong to
the PCID group associated with the forbidden Tracking Area is not affected.
In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, for some allowed multislot
configurations (see 3GPP TS 45.002), identification of a UTRAN TDD cell may
not be guaranteed. In such cases, the MS may not be able to fulfil the
requirement above. If after 5 seconds the MS has not been able to identify a
UTRAN TDD cell, the MS is allowed to stop searching for it in the current GSM
cell.
The MS is not required to measure cells known to be CSG cells while in packet
transfer mode. The MS shall not report cells known to be CSG cells while in
packet transfer mode other than as part of a cell change notification
procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.060) when the target cell is a CSG cell.
#### 10.1.4.2 Cell re-selection command
A cell re-selection command may be sent from the network to an MS. When the MS
receives the command, it shall re-select the cell according to the included
cell description and change the network control mode according to the command
(see 3GPP TS 44.060). The command may include re-selection of another radio
access technology/mode.
If an MS receives a cell re-selection command towards a GSM cell to which it
is not synchronised, the MS shall indicate a packet cell change failure (see
3GPP TS 44.060).
If a UTRAN capable MS receives a cell re-selection command towards a not known
UTRAN cell (see 3GPP TS 25.133 and 3GPP TS 25.123), or if a E-UTRAN capable MS
receives a cell re-selection command towards a not known E-UTRAN cell (see
3GPP TS 36.133), then the MS shall search for synchronisation information up
to 800 ms. In case of failure, the MS shall return to the old cell and
indicate a packet cell change failure (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
#### 10.1.4.3 Exceptional cases
An MS in network control mode NC1 or NC2 may enter an exceptional case if a
circuit switched connection is established, which takes precedence over GPRS
cell re-selection. This includes an MS operating in DTM.
In such a case the MS is not required to send measurement reports according to
subclause 10.1.4.1, and shall not obey any cell re-selection command.
Whenever the exceptional case ends, the MS shall resume the GPRS mode tasks as
specified in sub-clause 10.
## 10.2 RF Power Control
Sub-clauses 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 do not apply for the PDCH/H in Exclusive MAC
mode while in DTM. In this case:
  * The MS shall apply the output power ordered by the network on the SACCH to all channels (both for the TCH/H and the PDCH/H).
```{=html}
``` \- The network shall use the same output power on the dedicated connection
and on all the blocks on the PDCH/H addressed to the MS. Blocks not addressed
to the MS may be transmitted at a lower power level. As an exception, the
bursts transmitted on the BCCH carrier shall be transmitted at the BCCH level.
NOTE: Power control is not applicable to point-to-multipoint services if
transmission is without ARQ (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
### 10.2.1 MS output power
The RF output power, P~CH~ , to be employed by the MS on each individual
uplink PDCH shall be:
P~CH~ = min(Γ~0~ - Γ~CH~ - α * (C + 48), PMAX), (1)
where
> Γ~CH~ is an MS and channel specific power control parameter, sent to the MS
> in an RLC control message (see 3GPP TS 44.060). For those uplink PDCHs, for
> which Γ~CH~ has not been defined, value 0 shall be used.
>
> Γ~0~ = 39 dBm for GSM 400, GSM 700, GSM 850 and GSM900\ = 36 dBm for DCS1
> 800 and PCS 1900
>
> α is a system parameter, broadcast on PBCCH or optionally sent to MS in an
> RLC control message (see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060).
>
> C is the normalised received signal level at the MS as defined in 10.2.3.1.
>
> PMAX is the maximum allowed output power in the cell.
>
> For DCS 1800 and PCS 1900, PMAX =\ GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH if present,\
> MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH otherwise:
>
> For all other bands, PMAX =
>
> LB_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH + Band_offset, if LB_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH is present,
> otherwise GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH if present, otherwise MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH;
>
> where Band_offset equals:
>
> 0 dB for GSM 850 and GSM 900,
>
> -2 dB for GSM 700,
>
> -6 dB for GSM 400.
All power values are expressed in dBm.
When the MS receives new Γ~CH~ or α values, the MS shall use the new value to
update P~CH~ according to equation (1) 2 radio blocks after the end of the
frame containing the last timeslot of the message block containing the new
value, which ensures 2 blocks time for processing even in case of timeslot
reconfiguration.
The MS may round the calculated output power to the nearest nominal output
power value (see 3GPP TS 45.005) although a higher resolution is preferred.
The output power actually transmitted by the MS shall fulfil the absolute
accuracy as specified in 45.005. In addition, the transmitted power shall be a
monotonic function of the calculated output power and any change of 2 dB in
the calculated value shall correspond to a change of 2 ± 1.5 dB in the
transmitted value.
The MS shall use the same output power on all four bursts within one radio
block.
When accessing a cell on the PRACH or RACH (random access) or on the PACCH
when sending the PS Handover Access message, the MS shall use the output power
defined by PMAX.
MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH is broadcast on the BCCH of the cell. A class 3 DCS1 800 MS
shall add to it the value POWER OFFSET broadcast on the BCCH.
GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH is broadcast on PBCCH or CPBCCH of the serving cell and
in case of DTM, sent on SACCH and optionally on main DCCH.
LB_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH is optionally broadcast on BCCH of the serving cell, and
on PBCCH, PCCCH and PACCH if PBCCH is present.
If the MS accesses a cell on the PRACH before receiving GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH
on PBCCH and if LB_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH is not broadcast, the MS shall determine
PMAX using MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH as default.
If a calculated output power is not supported by the MS, the MS shall use the
supported output power which is closest to the calculated output power.
In case of DTM, if a valid C value does not exist, the MS may transmit on each
uplink PDCH with the output power signalled in the L1 header of the main
SACCH, until a valid C value exists.
The value of Γ~CH~ shall be the same for both PDCHs constituting an uplink
PDCH-pair in RTTI configuration (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
The MS may calculate the C value in dedicated mode.
### 10.2.2 BTS output power
Downlink power control can only be used when the serving BCCH or CPBCCH and
the used PDCH frequencies are in the same frequency band.
On the PDCHs that contain PBCCH or PCCCH, the BTS shall use constant output
power, which may be lower than the output power used on BCCH. The power
reduction (Pb) used on PCCCH, relative to the output power used on BCCH, is
broadcast on PBCCH. For COMPACT, on the blocks that contain CPBCCH, CPCCCH,
CFCCH, or CSCH, the BTS shall use constant output power.
On PTCCH/D, the BTS shall use the same output power as for PBCCH, or BCCH if
PBCCH does not exist. As an exception to this, the output power for some of
the PTCCH/D blocks may be lower in some cases (e.g. with adaptive antennas),
but with no requirements for the MS to decode them. The network is however
responsible to provide each MS with required TA information.
On other PDCH radio blocks, downlink power control may be used. The BTS shall
use the same output power on all four bursts within one radio block except for
bursts transmitted on the BCCH carrier. Thus, a procedure may be implemented
in the network to control the output power of the downlink transmission based
on the Channel Quality Reports.
On PDCHs that do not contain PBCCH or PCCCH and do not use downlink power
control (as indicated in the assignment message), the BTS shall use a constant
output power with the exception that it is not required to transmit on every
block. If the output power used on the transmitted blocks is not equal to
(BCCH level -- Pb) then the MS is not required to fulfil 3GPP TS 45.005
requirements for the first 25 blocks addressed to this MS.
In case of downlink power control, parameter P0 is used: P0 is defined as a
power reduction relative to BCCH or CPBCCH and is included in the assignment
message. The value of P0 is not allowed to change during Packet Transfer Mode
or MAC-Shared state except in the case a reassignment or a new assignment is
established not including any of the previously assigned PDCH(s). A MS shall
only have one P0 value at a time.
On each PDTCH/D block, the PR field of the MAC header, if present and if
downlink power control is used, shall indicate the output power level used to
send this block (see 3GPP TS 44.060). There shall be two PR management cases,
PR mode A and PR mode B, as indicated by the PR_MODE parameter in the
assignment (see 3GPP TS 44.060):
\- in PR mode A, the PR value shall be calculated relative to the P0 value of
the MS to which the RLC block is addressed;
\- in PR mode B, the network shall use the same P0 value for all the MS with a
TBF established on the same PDCH. Consequently, the PR value shall be
calculated relative to this P0 value.
The network shall not be allowed to change between PR modes during a TBF. The
network shall only allocate to an MS one PR_MODE at a time.
NOTE: Correct MS behaviour can not be assumed if PR mode B is used with
adaptive antennas.
The MS is required to meet the 45.005 specification under the following
conditions:
For synchronisation purpose, the network shall ensure that each MS with an
active TBF in uplink or downlink receives at least one block transmitted with
a coding scheme and a modulation that can be decoded by that MS every 360
millisecond interval (78 TDMA frames). If downlink power control is used:
\- in PR mode A, this block shall be addressed (RLC information) to this MS
and shall contain a usable PR field (i.e. not set to Not usable as specified
in 3GPP TS 44.060);
\- in PR mode B, this block shall contain a usable PR field (i.e. not set to
Not usable as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060) and does not necessarily have to be
addressed to any particular MS. The PR field remains optional in a downlink
RLC/MAC control block (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
If downlink power control is used, the BTS shall limit its output power on
blocks addressed to a particular MS (USF or RLC blocks) to levels between
(BCCH level -- P0dB) and (BCCH level -- P0dB -- 10dB). For other blocks the
output power shall not exceed (BCCH level -- P0dB). For COMPACT, the BCCH
level shall be replaced by the CPBCCH level in these formulas. The output
power must be sufficient for the MS for which the RLC block is intended as
well as the MS(s) for which the USF is intended (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
As an exception to the rules above, the bursts transmitted on the BCCH carrier
shall be transmitted at the BCCH level.
In DTM multislot configurations, if the BTS output power for the CS timeslot
is not within the range from the maximum downlink power allowed for the MS on
the PS timeslot(s) to a power level 10 dB lower, the MS is not required to
fulfil the requirements in 3GPP TS 45.005 on the CS timeslot and/or the PS
timeslot(s).
### 10.2.3 Measurements at MS side
A procedure shall be implemented in the MS to monitor periodically the
downlink Rx signal level and quality from its serving cell.
#### 10.2.3.1 Deriving the C value
##### 10.2.3.1.1 Packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state
In packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the MS shall periodically measure the
received signal level of the PCCCH or, if PCCCH is not existing, the CCCH or,
for COMPACT, the CPCCCH or CPBCCH, CFCCH, and CSCH. The MS shall measure the
received signal level of each paging block monitored by the MS according to
its current DRX mode and its paging group.
The normalised C value for each radio block is calculated:
C~block,n~ = SS~block,n~ + Pb (2)
where
SS~block,n~ is the mean of the received signal level of the four normal bursts
that compose the block.
Pb is the BTS output power reduction (relative to the output power used on
BCCH) used on the channel on which the measurements are performed. For PCCCH,
Pb is broadcast on PBCCH. If frequency hopping is being used on the associated
physical channel, Pb shall be reduced by 25% for each burst in the block which
is received on the BCCH frequency. For BCCH and for COMPACT, Pb =0 (not
broadcast).
Finally, the C~block,n~ values are filtered with a running average filter:
C~n~ = (1-a) ∗ C~n-1~ + a ∗ C~block,n~,
where a is the forgetting factor:
a = 1/MIN(n, MAX(5, T~AVG_W~*N~DRX~)).
N~DRX~ = the average number of monitored blocks per multiframe (see 3GPP TS
45.002).
T~AVG_W~ is broadcast on PBCCH or, if PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH, or on
CPBCCH or optionally sent to mobile station in an RLC/MAC control message (see
3GPP TS 44.060).
n is the iteration index. The filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the first
sample every time a new cell is selected. If the MS leaves dedicated mode and
then enters packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the filter shall be restarted
with n=1 for the first sample in case there is no valid C value during
dedicated mode. Otherwise, when entering packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state,
the filter shall continue from the n and C~n~ values obtained during previous
mode. The filter shall also continue from its previous state if N~DRX~ is
changed.
The current C~n~ value shall be used in formula (1) in subclause 10.2.1 to
calculate the output power when the MS transfers its first radio block.
##### 10.2.3.1.2 Packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state
In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, the MS shall use the same
received signal level measurements as made for cell reselection on the BCCH
carrier of the serving cell (see 10.1.1.2) or, for COMPACT, on the CPBCCH
carrier of the serving cell (see 12.4.1.2). The measurements shall be filtered
with a running average filter:
C~n~ = (1-b) ∗ C~n-1~ + b ∗ SS ~n~,
where
SS~n~ is the received signal level of the measurement samples.
b is the forgetting factor:
b = 1 for n=1;
b = 1/(6*T~AVG_T~).
n is the iteration index. The filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the first
sample at every cell change. When entering packet transfer mode from packet
idle mode or MAC-Shared state from MAC-Idle state, the filter shall continue
from the n and C~n~ values obtained during packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state.
In case the MS and the network support enhanced DTM CS release procedure, when
entering packet transfer mode from DTM, the filter shall continue from the n
and C~n~ values obtained during DTM. When entering DTM from dedicated mode,
the filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the first sample in case there is
no valid C value during dedicated mode. In case the MS and the network support
enhanced DTM CS establishment procedure, when entering DTM from packet
transfer mode, the filter shall continue from the n and C~n~ values obtained
during packet transfer mode.
If indicated by the parameter PC_MEAS_CHAN, the MS shall instead measure the
received signal level of each radio block on one of the PDCH s in BTTI
configuration or on one of the PDCH-pairs in RTTI configuration monitored by
the MS for PACCH. If downlink power control is used, PC_MEAS_CHAN shall
indicate measurements on the BCCH or CPBCCH, or the MS is not required to
fulfil 45.005 requirements. The MS may discard new PC_MEAS_CHAN values
received during packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state. For each downlink
radio block C~block,n~ shall be derived according to formula (2) specified in
10.2.3.1.1 (if PBCCH does not exist, and for COMPACT, Pb = 0). Finally, the
C~block,n~ values are filtered with a running average filter:
C~n~ = (1-c) ∗ C~n-1~ + c ∗ C~block,n~,
where c is the forgetting factor:
c = 1 for n=1;
c = 1/(12*T~AVG_T~).
n is the iteration index. The filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the first
sample at every cell change. When entering packet transfer mode from packet
idle mode or MAC-Shared state from MAC-Idle state, the filter shall continue
from the n and C~n~ values obtained during packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state.
In case the MS and the network support enhanced DTM CS release procedure, when
entering packet transfer mode from DTM, the filter shall continue from the n
and C~n~ values obtained during DTM. When entering DTM from dedicated mode,
the filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the first sample in case there is
no valid C value during dedicated mode. In case the MS and the network support
enhanced DTM CS establishment procedure, when entering DTM from packet
transfer mode, the filter shall continue from the n and C~n~ values obtained
during packet transfer mode.
NOTE 1: This method is suitable in the case where BCCH or CPBCCH is in another
frequency band than the used PDCHs.
The current C~n~ value shall be used to update formula (1) in subclause 10.2.1
each time a new C~n~ value is obtained or whenever the MS applies new Γ~CH~ or
α values.
For each correctly received block on one of the PDCHs monitored by the MS, the
MS shall calculate the variance of the received signal level as:
BL_VAR~n~ = 1/(j-1)*SUM(SS~k~ - SS~block,n~)^2^, k = 1,...,4
where SS~k~ is the received signal level of burst k within the block.
SS~block,n~ is the mean of the received signal level of the j normal bursts
that compose the radio block.
j is the number of bursts in the radio block = 4.
If frequency hopping is used and 1 burst of the block is received on the BCCH
carrier, that burst shall be discarded from the calculation (j = 3). If 2
bursts are received on the BCCH carrier, the whole block shall be discarded.
If 3 bursts are received on the BCCH carrier, the other burst shall be
discarded (j = 3).
If more than one PDCH are monitored the MS shall for each block period try to
find one correctly received block for the BL_VAR calculation. The block may be
taken from any of the monitored PDCHs.
The reported value, SIGN_VAR, shall be the average of BL_VAR within the
reporting period. The first reporting period starts with and includes the
first assignment message for an uplink or downlink transfer. The reporting
period ends, and the subsequent reporting period starts, no earlier than two
blocks before the transmission of a quality report and no later than one block
before the transmission of a quality report. In averaging, measurements made
during previous reporting periods shall always be discarded.
SIGN_VAR shall be included in the channel quality report (see subclause
10.2.3.2.3). If the channel quality report is included in a PACKET RESOURCE
REQUEST message, which is retransmitted due to lack of response (see 3GPP TS
44.060, 3GPP TS 44.160), the same or the most recent SIGN_VAR value shall be
sent and no new reporting period shall be started. This will ensure that a
valid SIGN_VAR value exists. The most recent SIGN_VAR value corresponds to the
most recent average of BL_VAR computed since the beginning of the last
reporting period.
T~AVG_T~ and PC_MEAS_CHAN are broadcast on PBCCH or, if PBCCH does not exist,
on BCCH or on CPBCCH or optionally sent to mobile station in an RLC/MAC
control message (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
#### 10.2.3.2 Derivation of Channel Quality Report
The channel quality is measured as the interference signal level during idle
frames of the multiframe, when the serving cell is not transmitting. No
measurements shall be taken on the BCCH carrier of the serving cell since the
BTS transmits with constant output power on this carrier. For COMPACT, the
channel quality is measured as the interference signal level during a PDTCH or
PACCH block (see Annex C). No measurements shall be taken on the CPBCCH,
CPCCCH, PTCCH, CFCCH, or CSCH since the BTS of the neighbouring co-channel
cells either does not transmit or transmits with constant output power.
##### 10.2.3.2.1 Packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state
In case of a downlink dual carrier assignment, the measurements specified in
this subclause shall be made separately on both radio frequency channels.
In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, the MS shall measure the
interference signal level on the same radio frequency channel as the assigned
PDCHs. The MS shall make these measurements during the search frames and PTCCH
frames, which are not required for BSIC decoding or the timing advance
procedure. For COMPACT, the MS shall estimate the interference level during
PDTCH/PACCH bursts (see Annex C).
Additionally, a multi-RAT MS is allowed to ignore interference signal level
measurements in search frames according subclause 10.1.1.3.
The MS shall perform interference signal measurements on as many of the
channels (timeslots) as possible and as a minimum:
For multislot class type 1 MS (see 3GPP TS 45.002), on the PDCH timeslot
numbers TSmin to TSmax, where
> TSmin = the lowest numbered timeslot assigned (on the respective radio
> frequency channel in case of a downlink dual carrier assignment) for uplink
> or downlink transfer including downlink PACCH associated with an uplink
> transfer.
>
> TSmax = MIN(TSmin + Rx --1, 7).
>
> Rx = the maximum number of receive timeslots that the MS can use per TDMA
> frame according to its multislot class, or Equivalent multislot class in
> case of a downlink dual carrier assignment (see 3GPP TS 45.002).
In case of DTM, the type 1 MS shall perform interference measurements also on
the TCH timeslot. Interference measurements need not be supported on PDCH
timeslot numbers above the TCH timeslot plus one.
For multislot class type 2 MS (see 3GPP TS 45.002), on the maximum number of
receive timeslots (Rx) that the MS can use per TDMA frame according to its
multislot class, or Equivalent multislot class in case of a downlink dual
carrier assignment (see 3GPP TS 45.002), in the following priority order,
except that no measurements are required on any timeslot number below those
with priority 1:
1) the PDCH timeslot numbers assigned for downlink transfer including > the
downlink PACCH associated with an uplink transfer;
2) the PDCH timeslot numbers assigned for uplink transfer;

implementation dependent which combination to > chose.
Interference measurement timeslots have lower priority than real receiver or
transmit timeslot and are not compulsory in case of conflict.
For each channel, every measurement SS~CH,n~ shall consist of the minimum of
the two signal level samples from one search frame and one PTCCH frame. These
two measurements should be spaced as closely as possible, but there is no
requirement that they shall be contiguous. Thus the SACCH frames are avoided
(except for a physical channel with two TCH/Hs) and only the interference is
measured. As an exception in case of DTM, every measurement SS~CH,n~ on the
TCH timeslot shall consist of a signal level sample from one search frame only
(since SACCH transmission on this slot cannot occur at the search frame). For
COMPACT, for each channel, at least two interference measurement sample,
SS~CH,n~, shall shall be taken every multiframe.
The measured interference shall be averaged in a running average filter:
γ~CH,n~ = (1-d) ∗ γ~CH,n-1~ + d ∗ SS~CH,n~, γ~CH,\ 0~ = 0
where d is the forgetting factor:
d = 1/MIN(n, N~AVG_I~).
n is the iteration index.
The filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the first sample when the MS enters
packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state or every time a new cell is selected.
Channel reassignment during packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state shall be
considered as start of a new packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state preceded
by a zero length packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state.
For each channel, the MS shall perform at least N~AVG_I~ (rounded to the
nearest integer) measurements of SS~CH,n~ before valid γ~CH~ values can be
determined
During GPRS downlink TBF transfer, the MS shall measure the received signal
quality as defined in subclause 8.2. The reported value, RXQUAL, shall be the
average within the reporting period. Only successfully decoded blocks intended
for that MS shall be included in the average. Alternatively, if CS4 only is
used during the reporting period, the MS is allowed to report RXQUAL = 7. If
CS-4 is used with other CS within a reporting period, the MS shall not take
into account CS-4 blocks in the calculation of RXQUAL: the MS shall compute
the average taking into account other CS only. If no block has been correctly
decoded during the reporting period, the MS shall report RXQUAL = 7, whatever
the used CS. The first reporting period starts with and includes the first
assignment message for the downlink transfer. The reporting period ends, and
the subsequent reporting starts, no earlier than two blocks before the
transmission of a quality report and no later than one block before the
transmission of a quality report. In averaging, measurements made during
previous reporting periods shall always be discarded.
During EGPRS downlink TBF transfer, the MS shall measure the received signal
quality as defined in subclause 8.2.
In BTTI configuration, the quality parameters shall be, for the radio blocks
intended for this MS only (i.e. at least radio blocks where the TFI
identifying this MS can be decoded from the RLC/MAC header and radio blocks
where the TFI identifying this MS can be decoded from the RLC/MAC control
block header: see 3GPP TS 44.060), individually averaged per channel
(timeslot) and per modulation type as follows:

> x~n~ values 1 and 0 denote the existence and absence of quality parameters,
> respectively.
In RTTI configuration, the quality parameters shall be, for the radio blocks
intended for this MS only (i.e. at least radio blocks where the TFI
identifying this MS can be decoded from the RLC/MAC header and radio blocks
where the TFI identifying this MS can be decoded from the RLC/MAC control
block header: see 3GPP TS 44.060), individually averaged per channel (timeslot
pair where TN is the lower numbered timeslot of the timeslot pair) and per
modulation type as follows:

An MS shall calculate the overall MEAN_BEP, and CV_BEP per modulation type as
average over all assigned channels (timeslots) irrespective whether blocks
were received on a channel (timeslot or timeslot pair where TN is the lower
numbered timeslot of the timeslot pair) since it last sent a measurement
report to the network as follows:
where n = the iteration index at reporting time
j = the channel number.
When entering packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state and/or when selecting a
new cell, the filters shall reset the values of n to 0. When a new channel
(timeslot or timeslot pair) is assigned for a downlink TBF, the filters shall
reset the values of MEAN_BEP_TN ~n-1~ , CV_BEP_TN ~n-1~ and R ~n-1~ to 0 for
this channel (timeslot or timeslot pair where TN is the lower numbered
timeslot of the timeslot pair). If frequency hopping is used, channels that
only differ in MAIO shall not be considered new in this context.
The reporting period ends no earlier than two blocks for a GPRS TBF mode and
three blocks for an EGPRS TBF mode before the transmission of a quality report
and no later than one block before the transmission of a quality report.
N~AVG_I~ is broadcast on PBCCH or, if PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH or CPBCCH
or optionally sent to mobile station in an RLC/MAC control message (see 3GPP
TS 44.060).
##### 10.2.3.2.2 Void
##### 10.2.3.2.3 Measurement reporting
The MS shall transfer γ~CH~ values and the RXQUAL, C and SIGN_VAR values (see
subclause 10.2.3.1.2) to the network in the Channel Quality Report on PACCH.
An MS using EGPRS or EGPRS2 shall instead of RXQUAL and SIGN_VAR send MEAN_BEP
and CV_BEP.
In case of EGPRS the MS shall report the overall MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP for the
modulations, GMSK and/or 8-PSK (i.e. GMSK_MEAN_BEP, GMSK_CV_BEP; and/or
8PSK_MEAN_BEP, 8PSK_CV_BEP respectively) for which it has received blocks on
at least one allocated channel (timeslot or timeslot pair) since it last sent
a measurement report to the network.
Additionally, in case of EGPRS, the MS shall report MEAN_BEP_TNx on a per
timeslot basis in BTTI configuration, or on a per timeslot pair basis in RTTI
configuration where TNx is the lower numbered timeslot of the timeslot pair
according to what the network has ordered (see 3GPP TS 44.060). An MS shall
only include MEAN_BEP_TNx values for the modulation scheme with which it has
received the larger number of blocks on its currently assigned channels
(timeslots or timeslot pairs) since it last sent a measurement report to the
network.
In case of EGPRS2 downlink the MS shall report the MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP for all
timeslots in the TBF for the specified modulation schemes (i.e. GMSK and/or
8-PSK and/or 16-QAM at NSR and/or 32-QAM at NSR in case of EGPRS2-A downlink;
GMSK and/or 8-PSK and/or QPSK and/or 16-QAM at NSR and/or 32-QAM at NSR and/or
16-QAM at HSR and/or 32-QAM at HSR in case of EGPRS2-B) as described in the
EGPRS BEP Link Quality Measurements Type 2 IE (see subclause 12.5a.2 in 3GPP
TS 44.060) for which it has received blocks on at least one allocated channel
(timeslot or timeslot pair) since it last sent a measurement report to the
network.
In the case of EGPRS2-A downlink, the MS shall report the MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP
for the two modulation schemes with the highest number of received blocks, not
including RLC/MAC control blocks. If the modulation schemes have equal number
of received blocks, the selection of which of these modulation schemes to
report is implementation dependent.
In the case of EGPRS2-B downlink, the MS shall report the MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP
for the modulation schemes with the highest non-zero values of
N_BLOCKS_WEIGHTED (for up to a maximum of two modulation schemes), where
N_BLOCKS_WEIGHTED is defined as:
> \- 2 x N_BLOCKS, if the modulation scheme is \'preferred\';
>
> \- otherwise, min(N_BLOCKS, BEP_PERIOD2, RP/2), if BEP_PERIOD2 has been
> received by the mobile station or min(N_BLOCKS, BEP_PERIOD,RP/2) if
> BEP_PERIOD2 has not been received by the mobile station;
where
> \- N_BLOCKS is the number of blocks using the modulation scheme that were
> received with a TFI value associated with a TBF corresponding to the mobile
> station since the previous report, not including RLC/MAC control blocks,
>
> \- RP is the number of basic radio block periods that have elapsed since the
> previous report (i.e. the previous instance of the EGPRS BEP Link Quality
> Measurements Type 2 IE) was transmitted,
>
> \- EGPRS2-B modulation schemes which are \'preferred\' are: GMSK, QPSK,
> 16-QAM HSR and 32-QAM HSR.
In case any modulation schemes have equal value of N_BLOCKS_WEIGHTED, the
modulation scheme with higher N_BLOCKS shall be reported in preference. If
these modulation schemes have also equal values of N_BLOCKS, the selection of
which of these modulation schemes to report is implementation dependent.
If fewer than two modulation schemes have non-zero values of N_BLOCKS_WEIGHTED
and if GMSK was received with a TFI value associated with a TBF corresponding
to the mobile station since the previous report, but only in (one or more)
RLC/MAC control blocks, the MS shall also report the link quality for GMSK.
Additionally, in case of EGPRS2, if commanded by the network according to the
LINK_QUALITY_MEASUREMENT_MODE field, the MS shall report both MEAN_BEP_TNx and
REPORTED_MODULATION on a per timeslot (in BTTI configuration) or timeslot pair
(in RTTI configuration where TNx is the lower number timerslot of the
timerslot pair) basis as specified in the EGPRS Timeslot Link Quality
Measurements Type 2 IE. More specifically, for each of its currently assigned
timeslots or timeslot pairs, an MS shall report the modulation scheme
(indicated using the REPORTED_MODULATION field) with which it has received the
greatest number of blocks since the last report and shall report the
MEAN_BEP_TNx of that modulation scheme (see subclause 12.5a.3 in 3GPP TS
44.060). In case there are more than one modulation scheme having the same
number and the largest number of blocks on a currently assigned timeslot, the
MS shall report the MEAN_BEP_TNx for the highest order modulation scheme among
those modulation schemes on that timeslot.
The report contains the available γ~CH~ values for the radio frequency channel
on which the message is sent as well as the RXQUAL, C and SIGN_VAR values (see
subclause 10.2.3.1.2) or in case of EGPRS and EGPRS2 the MEAN_BEP, C and
CV_BEP values, except for a downlink dual carrier assignment.
The conditions for including the different values, which are not always
mandatory, are specified in 3GPP TS 44.060. The mapping of γ~ch~ to the
reported I_LEVEL value is defined in subclause 10.3.
##### 10.2.3.2.4 Measurement reporting - additional requirements for downlink
dual carrier
In case of a downlink dual carrier assignment, the γ~CH~, C, MEAN_BEP (overall
and per timeslot or timeslot pair measurements) and CV_BEP values may be
reported for each of the radio frequency channels as specified in 3GPP TS
44.060.
If the required set of the measurements (overall MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP,
MEAN_BEP_TNx measurements and / or γ~ch~) to be reported for a given carrier
as specified in sub-clause 10.2.3.2.3 does not fit in the message used for
sending the measurements (see 3GPP TS 44.060) and would otherwise include the
overall MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP for two candidate modulations, the mobile station
shall, for the corresponding carrier, only send the overall MEAN_BEP and
CV_BEP for a single modulation, selected as follows:
\- in case of EGPRS or EGPRS2-A, the modulation scheme for which it has
received the highest number of blocks since it last sent a measurement report;
if an equal number of blocks have been received for the two candidate
modulation schemes, the selection of which of these modulation schemes to
report is implementation dependent;
\- in case of EGPRS2-B, the modulation scheme with the highest non zero value
of N_BLOCKS_WEIGHTED; if the two candidate modulation schemes have equal non
zero value of N_BLOCKS_WEIGHTED, the modulation scheme with higher N_BLOCKS
shall be reported in preference; if these two modulation schemes have also
equal values of N_BLOCKS, the selection of which of these modulation schemes
to report is implementation dependent.
In addition, when not all MEAN BEP_TNx measurements can be included in the
message used for reporting the measurements, the selection of the timeslots
for which MEAN BEP_TNx measurements are included is left implementation
dependent.
#### 10.2.3.3 Range of parameters MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP for EGPRS2
The mapping of the MEAN_BEP to the equivalent BEP and the accuracies to which
an MS shall be capable of estimating the quality parameters under static
channel conditions are given in the following tables for EGPRS2-A DL (16-QAM
and 32-QAM) and for EGPRS2-B DL (QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM) respectively. The
accuracy requirements below apply for sensitivity limited operation for signal
levels above the reference sensitivity level for the type of MS, assuming no
changes in transmitted downlink power. The requirements apply for PDTCH/F in
_A/Gb mode_ , and the estimated values are averaged applying filtering
according to subclause 10.2.3.2.1 with forgetting factor of 0.03.

* * *
The accuracy requirements for CV_BEP need not be specified since they are
directly linked to those for MEAN_BEP. Nevertheless, the CV_BEP measured at
the MS shall be the one used by this MS.
### 10.2.4 Measurements at BSS side
A procedure shall be implemented in the BSS to monitor the uplink Rx signal
level and quality on each uplink PDCH, active as well as inactive.
The BSS shall also measure the Rx signal level and the quality of a specific
MS packet transfer.
## 10.2a Packet-switched Handover
If an MS receives a packet-switched handover command towards a GSM cell which
it is not synchronised to, then the MS shall search for synchronisation
information up to 300 ms. In case of failure, the MS shall indicate a packet
cell change failure (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
If a multi-RAT MS receives a packet-switched handover command towards a not
known cell (see 3GPP TS 25.133 and 3GPP TS 25.123 for UTRAN or 3GPP TS 36.133
for E-UTRAN), then the multi-RAT MS shall search for synchronisation
information up to 800 ms. In case of failure, the multi-RAT MS shall indicate
a packet cell change failure (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
Details of the synchronization mechanisms appear in 3GPP TS 45.010.
## 10.3 Measurement requirements
The accuracy of the received signal level and interference measurements shall
be as defined in subclause 8.1.2. For COMPACT, the accuracy of the
interference estimate, which is based upon received signal level during a
PDTCH/PACCH block (see Annex C), is ± 2 dB in addition to the accuracy of the
received signal level defined in subclause 8.1.2 without downlink power
control activated on the serving cell. The measured signal strength values
shall be mapped to the reported C values as defined for RXLEV in subclause
8.1.4. If included in a PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK or a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST
message, the measured interference level, γ~CH~, shall be mapped to a reported
I_LEVEL value between 0 and 15, relative to reported C value as follows:
I_LEVEL 0 = interference level is greater than C\ I_LEVEL 1 = interference
level is less than or equal to C and greater than C - 2 dB\ I_LEVEL 2 =
interference level is less than or equal to C - 2 dB and greater than C - 4
dB\ :\ :\ I_LEVEL 14 = interference level is less than or equal to C - 26 dB
and greater than C - 28 dB\ I_LEVEL 15 = interference level is less than or
equal to C - 28 dB

A non-exhaustive list of parameters employed to control the radio links for
GPRS are shown in table 3.

# 11 CTS mode tasks
## 11.1 CTS idle mode tasks
Whilst attempting to attach to a CTS-FP, a CTS-MS shall implement the CTS cell
selection procedure described in 3GPP TS 43.022. This procedure makes use of
measurements and sub‑procedures described in this clause. The procedure
ensures that the CTS-MS is CTS attached to a CTS cell from which it can
reliably decode downlink data and where access to CTS service is allowed.
Whilst in CTS idle mode, the CTS-MS shall implement procedures reporting to
the CTS-FP (AFA monitoring, BCCH detection and OFO measurement), described in
3GPP TS 43.022. These procedure makes use of measurements and sub-procedures
described in this clause, and are used for the frequency control of the
system, described in 3GPP TS 45.056 and 3GPP TS 45.010.
This clause makes use of terms defined in 3GPP TS 43.022.
For the purpose of CTS cell selection, the CTS-MS shall be capable of
detecting and synchronizing to a CTSBCH carrier and read the CTSBCH-SB data at
reference sensitivity level and reference interference levels as specified in
3GPP TS 45.005. A CTS-MS in CTS idle mode shall always fulfil the performance
requirement specified in 3GPP TS 45.005 at levels down to reference
sensitivity level or reference interference level.
For the purpose of CTS cell selection, the CTS-MS shall compute an average of
received signal levels for the CTSBCH carrier. This quantity called 'received
level average' shall be unweighted average of the received signal level
measured in dBm. The accuracy of the signal level measurements for CTS cell
selection and the other idle mode tasks shall be the same as for radio link
measurements.
The tolerance on all the timing requirements in this subclause is ±10 %.
### 11.1.1 CTS cell selection
#### 11.1.1.1 Synchronization and measurements for CTS cell selection
The CTS-MS shall store the CTSBCH ARFCN for each CTS-FP the CTS-MS is enrolled
with.
In the modes where CTS cell selection is required (see 3GPP TS 43.022), for
each CTS-FP the CTS-MS is enrolled with, the CTS-MS shall periodically attempt
to synchronize to the stored CTSBCH carrier. When attempting to synchronize to
the CTSBCH carrier, the CTS-MS shall attempt to detect the frequency
correction burst of the CTSBCH-FB and when detected, to decode the
synchronization burst of the CTSBCH-SB and read the CTSBCH-SB information. The
CTS-MS shall calculate the received level average of the CTSBCH carrier, the
averaging being based on at least five measurement samples taken on the CTSBCH
bursts.
The maximum time allowed to synchronize to a CTSBCH carrier and read the
CTSBCH-SB information shall be 5 seconds.
#### 11.1.1.2 Initial sychronization of CTS-MS
In order to perform upper layer procedures, e.g. the enrolment of a CTS-MS
(see 3GPP TS 44.056), a special procedure shall be implemented in the CTS-FP,
by which the initial synchronisation of a CTS-MS with the CTS-FP is eased.
This procedure of initial synchronisation of CTS-MS shall be triggered by the
CTS upper layers.
The procedure consists in transmitting the CTSBCH in every TDMA frame with the
following pattern :
if FN mod 52 = 25 then the CTSBCH-FB is transmitted
else
if FN mod 2 = 0 then the CTSBCH-FB is transmitted
if FN mod 2 = 1 then the CTSBCH-SB is transmitted
The first burst sent with this pattern shall be the next programmed CTSBCH-FB
on the TDMA frame : FN mod 52 = 25. The above transmission pattern shall be
repeated for a period of 120 52-multiframe. No CTSBCH shifting shall be
allowed during the pattern: the CTSBCH timeslot number shall be the TNC, see
3GPP TS 45.002.
The CTS-MS shall attempt to synchronize to the CTSBCH transmitted with the
above pattern. Once synchronized, the CTS-MS shall perform the non-hopping
access procedure, e.g. for enrolment purpose (see 3GPP TS 44.056). Upon
reception of the access request message by the CTS-FP, the pattern
transmission shall be stopped.
### 11.1.2 Criterion for CTS cell selection
The path loss criterion parameter C1_CTS used for CTS cell selection is
defined by:
C1_CTS = Received Level Average ‑ CTS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN
where: CTS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN = Minimum received level at the CTS-MS required
for access to the system ; this parameter shall be given by the CTS-FP to CTS-
MS during the enrolment procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.056) and shall be stored in
the CTS-MS for each CTS-FP it is enrolled with. The parameter can be updated
on request of the CTS-FP.
All values are expressed in dBm.
The path loss criterion (3GPP TS 43.022) is satisfied if C1_CTS > 0.
### 11.1.3 Monitoring of CTSBCH and CTSPCH
#### 11.1.3.1 Monitoring of received signal level
Whilst in CTS idle mode, the CTS-MS shall measure the received signal level of
the CTSBCH and shall calculate the received level average of the CTSBCH
carrier, the averaging being a running average on at least five collected
measurement samples and a maximum time of 11 seconds (5*9*52 frames). The
criterion C2_CTS defined below shall be calculated every time the CTS-MS
decodes the CTSBCH in its CTS paging group :
C2_CTS = C1_CTS + CTS_CELL_RESELECT_OFFSET
If the criterion C2_CTS falls below zero for a period of 15 seconds, the CTS-
MS shall considered itself as de-attached with the CTS-FP and shall perform
the CTS cell selection specified in subclause 11.1.1.
#### 11.1.3.2 Downlink beacon failure
The downlink beacon failure criterion is based on the downlink beacon failure
counter DBC. Whilst in CTS idle mode on a CTS cell, DBC shall be initialized
to a value equal to the nearest integer to 90/N where N is the number of
paging groups defined for the CTS-FP (see 3GPP TS 45.002 subclause 6.5.7).
Thereafter, whenever the CTS-MS attempts to decode CTSBCH-SB information bits
(see 3GPP TS 45.002): if the information bits are successfully decoded DBC is
increased by 1, however never beyond the initial value, otherwise DBC is
decreased by 4. When DBC ≤ 0, a downlink beacon failure shall be declared.
If a downlink beacon failure occurs, the CTS-MS shall consider itself as de-
attached with the CTS-FP and shall perform the CTS cell selection specified in
subclause 11.1.1.
#### 11.1.3.3 Downlink paging failure
The downlink paging failure criterion is based on the downlink paging failure
counter DPC. Whilst in CTS idle mode on a CTS cell, DPC shall be initialized
to a value equal to CTSPCH_DECOD (this parameter shall be given by the CTS-FP
to the CTS-MS during the attachment procedure, see 3GPP TS 44.056).
Thereafter, each time the CTS-MS is required to decode a paging message on the
CTSPCH (see 3GPP TS 45.002 subclause 6.5.1 ix)): if the paging message is not
successfully decoded (BFI = 1) DPC is decreased by 1, otherwise DPC is re-
initialized to CTSPCH_DECOD. When DPC ≤ 0, a downlink paging failure shall be
declared.
If a downlink paging failure occurs, the CTS-MS shall consider itself as de-
attached with the CTS-FP and shall perform the CTS cell selection specified in
subclause 11.1.1.
### 11.1.4 Procedures with reporting to the CTS-FP
Whilst in CTS idle mode, the CTS-FP may order to the CTS-MS to complete the
procedures defined hereafter. The order for each procedure is sent to the CTS-
MS during a dedicated connection (see 3GPP TS 44.056).
For each of the procedures, a maximum time of processing is allowed. When
multiple procedures are ordered in a single dedicated connection, the results
shall be ready to be reported to the CTS-FP when the time corresponding to the
sum of the maximum time of each procedure has expired.
#### 11.1.4.1 AFA monitoring
The reporting of the AFA monitoring procedure is used by the AFA algorithm for
the frequency management of the CTS (see 3GPP TS 45.056).
The parameters sent by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS in the AFA monitoring order
message shall be a list of n carriers : AFA monitoring frequency list,
AMFL(1,...,n), together with the number of AFA monitoring cycles NAMC to
perform.
For each carrier of the AMFL, the CTS-MS shall perform NAMC basic
measurements, where a basic measurement shall be the average received signal
level on the 8 timeslots of the TDMA frame. The delay between two consecutive
basic measurements shall be at least 5 seconds. The received interference
level of the carrier shall be the maximum of the NAMC basic measurements.
The maximum processing time for this procedure shall be (NAMC x 10) seconds.
When ordered by the CTS-FP, the CTS-MS shall report in the next AFA monitoring
report message a table of received interference level of the carrier of the
AMFL, INTERF_LEV (1,...,n), together with the minimum of the numbers of
performed AFA monitoring cycles, NAMC_REAL ; the procedure shall be stopped.
#### 11.1.4.2 BCCH detection
The reporting of the BCCH detection procedure may be used by the CTS-FP by the
AFA algorithm and for the OFO request.
The parameters sent by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS in the BCCH detection message
shall be a list of m carriers : BCCH detection frequency list, BDFL(1,..,m).
For each carrier of the list, the CTS-MS shall attempt to synchronize to it
and decode the SCH. The BCCH detection shall be failed (BCCH not detected) if
the CTS-MS fails to decode the SCH.
The procedure shall be completed in maximum (m x 10) seconds
When ordered by the CTS-FP, the CTS-MS shall report in the next BCCH detection
report message a table of BCCH detection status of the carriers of the list,
BCCH_DETECT (1, ..., m) ; the procedure shall be stopped.
#### 11.1.4.3 Observed Frequency Offset (OFO) measurement
The reported OFO measurements shall be used by the CTS-FP to correct its
frequency source (see 3GPP TS 45.010).
The parameters sent by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS in the OFO measurement message
shall be a list of k BCCH carriers : OFO measurement BCCH list, OMBL(1,..,k).
For each BCCH carrier of the list, the CTS-MS shall attempt to assess the
frequency offset between the BCCH carrier and the CTS-FP. The measurement
status shall be "failed" if an offset measurement accuracy better than 0.2 ppm
cannot be ensured.
The procedure shall be completed in maximum (k x 15) seconds
When ordered by the CTS-FP, the CTS-MS shall report in the next OFO
measurement report message the table of OFO measurements and measurement
status of the BCCH carriers of the list : OFO_MEAS(1,...,k), OFO_STATUS(1,
...,k) ; the procedure shall be stopped.
## 11.2 Intra-cell handover
### 11.2.1 Overall process
The overall intra-cell handover process is implemented in the CTS-MS and CTS-
FP. Measurement of radio subsystem downlink performance is made in the CTS-MS.
These measurements are signalled to the CTS-FP for assessment. The CTS-FP
measures the uplink performance for the CTS-MS being served. Initial
assessment of the measurements in conjunction with defined thresholds and
intra-cell handover strategy shall be performed in the CTS-FP.
### 11.2.2 CTS-MS measurement procedure
A procedure shall be implemented in the CTS-MS by which it monitors the
downlink RX signal level and quality from its serving CTS cell. The
requirements for the CTS-MS measurements are given in subclause 11.5.
### 11.2.3 CTS-FP measurement procedure
A procedure shall be implemented in the CTS-FP by which it monitors the uplink
RX signal level and quality from each CTS-MS being served by the CTS cell.
### 11.2.4 Strategy
The intra-cell handover strategy employed by the CTS-FP for radio link control
determines the handover decision that will be made based on the CTS
measurement results reported by the CTS-MS and made by the CTS-FP, and on
various parameters set for each CTS-FP.
Due to the Total Frequency Hopping applied to the traffic channels in CTS,
intra‑cell handover can only occur to a different timeslot of the CTS cell.
Intra‑cell handover from one timeslot in the CTS cell to another timeslot in
the same CTS cell will normally be performed if the CTS measurement results
show a low RXQUAL, but a high RXLEV on the serving CTS cell. This indicates a
degradation of quality caused by interference even though the CTS-MS is
situated within the coverage area of the serving CTS cell. The intra‑cell
handover should provide a timeslot with a lower level of interference.
## 11.3 RF power control
### 11.3.1 Overall process
RF power control is employed to minimize the transmit power required by CTS-MS
or CTS-FP whilst maintaining the quality of the radio links. By minimizing the
transmit power levels, interference to co‑channel users is reduced.
### 11.3.2 CTS-MS implementation
RF power control shall be implemented in the CTS-MS.
The power control level to be employed by the CTS-MS on the uplink channel is
indicated by means of the power control information sent either in the layer 1
header of each SACCH message block (see 3GPP TS 44.004) on the corresponding
downlink channel, or in a dedicated signalling block (see 3GPP TS 44.056).
The CTS-MS shall employ the most recently commanded power control level
(parameter CTS_MS_TXPWR_REQUEST) for all transmitted bursts on either a TCH,
FACCH or SACCH.
The CTS-MS shall confirm the power control level that it is currently
employing in the SACCH L1 header on the uplink (parameter CTS_MS_TXPWR_CONF).
The indicated value shall be the power control level actually used by the CTS-
MS for the last burst of the previous SACCH period.
When accessing a cell on the ARCH (CTS access request) and before receiving
the first power command during a communication on a TCH (after a CTS immediate
assignment message), the CTS-MS shall use the power control level defined by
the CTS_MS_MAX_TXPWR parameters ; this parameters shall be given by the CTS-FP
to the CTS-MS during the enrolment procedure, and can be updated on request of
the CTS-FP.
If a power control level defined in 3GPP TS 45.005 is received but the level
is not supported by the CTS-MS, the CTS-MS shall use the supported output
power which is closest to the output power indicated by the received power
control level.
### 11.3.3 CTS-MS power control range
The range over which a CTS-MS shall be capable of varying its RF output power
shall be from its maximum authorized output power CTS_MS_MAX_TXPWR, down its
lowest nominal output power (as defined in 3GPP TS 45.005), in steps of
nominally 2 dB.
3GPP TS 45.005 gives a detailed definition of the RF power level step size and
tolerances for a CTS-MS.
### 11.3.4 CTS-FP implementation
RF power control shall be implemented in the CTS-FP.
### 11.3.5 CTS-FP power control range
The range over which a CTS-FP shall be capable of varying its RF output power
shall be from its maximum authorized output power CTS_FP_MAX_TXPWR down its
lowest nominal output power (as defined in 3GPP TS 45.056), in steps of
nominally 2 dB.
3GPP TS 45.056 gives a detailed definition of the RF power level step size and
tolerances for a CTS-FP.
### 11.3.6 Strategy
The RF power control strategy employed by the CTS-FP determines the ordered
power control level that is signalled to the CTS-MS, and the power control
level that is employed by the CTS-FP.
The power control level to be employed in each case shall be based on the CTS
measurement results reported by the CTS-MS and made by the CTS-FP, and on
various parameters set for each CTS-FP.
If the CTS-MS reports in each CTS measurement results a RXQUAL_0 and a RXLEV
greater or equal to 31, for a period of 30 seconds, the CTS-FP RF output power
shall be at the end of this period the lowest nominal output power specified
in 3GPP TS 45.056.
Under static interference free conditions, if the CTS-MS signal level received
by the CTS-FP is greater or equal to -85 dBm for a period of 30 seconds, the
CTS-FP shall command the CTS-MS to reduce its RF output power, so that the
CTS-MS RF output power is at the end of this period the lowest nominal output
power specified in 3GPP TS 45.005.
### 11.3.7 Timing
Upon receipt of a command from an SACCH to change its power level, the CTS-MS
shall change to the new level at a rate of one nominal 2 dB power control step
every 60 ms (13 TDMA frames), i.e. a range change of 15 steps should take
about 900 ms. The change shall begin at the first TDMA frame belonging to the
next reporting period (as specified in subclause 11.5.4). The CTS-MS shall
change the power one nominal 2 dB step at a time, at a rate of one step every
60 ms following the initial change, irrespective of whether actual
transmission takes place or not.
In case of intra-cell handover, the commanded power control level shall be
applied on the new timeslot immediately.
## 11.4 Radio link failure
### 11.4.1 Criterion
The criterion for determining Radio Link Failure in the CTS-MS shall be based
on the success rate of decoding messages on the downlink SACCH.
### 11.4.2 CTS-MS procedure
The aim of determining radio link failure in the CTS-MS is to ensure that
calls with unacceptable voice/data quality, which cannot be improved either by
RF power control or intra-cell handover, are either re‑established or released
in a defined manner.
The radio link failure criterion is based on the radio link counter S_CTS. If
the CTS-MS is unable to decode a SACCH message (BFI = 1), S_CTS is decreased
by 1. In the case of a successful reception of a SACCH message (BFI = 0) S_CTS
is increased by 2. In any case S_CTS shall not exceed the value of
CTS_RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT. If S_CTS reaches 0 a CTS radio link failure shall be
declared. The action to be taken is specified in 3GPP TS 44.056. The
CTS_RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT parameter is transmitted by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS
during the attachment procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.056). For the attachment or
enrolment procedure, the CTS_RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT shall be set to 64.
The CTS-MS shall continue transmitting as normal on the uplink until S_CTS
reaches 0.
The algorithm shall start after the assignment of a dedicated channel and
S_CTS shall be initialized to CTS_RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT.
The detailed operation shall be as follows:
\- the radio link time‑out algorithm shall be stopped at the reception of a
CTS intra-cell handover command;
\- (re‑)initialization and start of the algorithm shall be done whenever the
CTS-MS switches to a new timeslot, at the latest when the main signalling link
(see 3GPP TS 44.056) has been established;
\- the CTS_RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT value used at (re‑)initialization shall be that
used on the previous timeslot (in the CTS immediate assignment case the value
stored by the CTS-MS during the attachment procedure), or the value received
on SACCH if the CTS-MS has received a CTS_RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT value on the new
channel before the initialization;
\- if the first CTS_RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT value on the SACCH is received on the
new channel after the initialization, the counter shall be re‑initialized with
the new value.
### 11.4.3 CTS-FP procedure
The criteria for determining radio link failure in the CTS-FP should be based
upon either the error rate on the uplink SACCH or on RXLEV/RXQUAL measurements
reported by the CTS-MS.
## 11.5 Radio link measurements
Radio link measurements are used in the intra-cell handover and RF power
control processes.
The measurements are made over each SACCH multiframe, which is 104 TDMA frames
(480 ms) for a TCH.
### 11.5.1 Signal strength
#### 11.5.1.1 General
The received signal level may be employed as a criterion in the RF power
control and intra-cell handover processes.
#### 11.5.1.2 Physical parameter
As specified in subclause 8.1.2, measured by the CTS-MS and CTS-FP.
#### 11.5.1.3 Statistical parameters
For each channel, the measured parameters (RXLEV) shall be the average of the
received signal level measurement samples in dBm taken on that channel within
the reporting period of length one SACCH multiframe defined in 11.5.4. In
averaging, measurements made during previous reporting periods shall always be
discarded.
When assigned a TCH, the CTS-MS shall make a received signal level measurement
on all bursts of the associated physical channel (see 3GPP TS 45.002),
including those of the SACCH.
For any TCH assigned to a CTS-MS, the CTS-FP shall make a received signal
level measurement on all bursts of the associated physical channel including
those of the SACCH.
#### 11.5.1.4 Range of parameter
As specified subclause in subclause 8.1.4.
### 11.5.2 Signal quality
#### 11.5.2.1 General
The received signal quality shall be employed as a criterion in the RF power
control and intra-cell handover processes.
#### 11.5.2.2 Physical parameter
As specified in subclause 8.2.2, measured by the CTS-MS and CTS-FP.
#### 11.5.2.3 Statistical parameters
For each channel, the measured parameters (RXQUAL) shall be the received
signal quality, averaged on that channel over the reporting period of length
one SACCH multiframe defined in subclause 11.5.4. In averaging, measurements
made during previous reporting periods shall always be discarded.
#### 11.5.2.4 Range of parameter
As specified in subclause 8.2.4.
### 11.5.3 Aspects of discontinuous transmission (DTX)
The use of DTX is mandatory for the CTS-MS and the CTS-FP on a TCH. Not all
TDMA frames may be transmitted, however, the subset specified in subclause 8.3
shall always be transmitted, and hence can be employed to assess quality and
signal level during DTX.
### 11.5.4 Measurement reporting for the CTS-MS on a TCH
For a TCH, the reporting period of length 104 TDMA frames (480 ms) is defined
in terms of TDMA frame numbers (FN) as follows:
* * *
Timeslot number (TN) TDMA frame number (FN) modulo 104  
TCH/F Reporting period SACCH Message block 0 and 1 0 to 103 12, 38, 64, 90 2
and 3 26 to 25 38, 64, 90, 12 4 and 5 52 to 51 64, 90, 12, 38 6 and 7 78 to 77
90, 12, 38, 64
* * *
When on a TCH, the CTS-MS shall assess during the reporting period and
transmit to the CTS-FP in the next SACCH message block the following:
‑ CTS_RXLEV_FULL_SERVING_CELL and CTS_RXQUAL_FULL_SERVING_CELL :\ RXLEV_FULL
and RXQUAL_FULL for the full set of TCH and SACCH TDMA frames. The full set of
TDMA frames is 100 (i.e. 104 ‑ 4 idle) frames for a full rate TCH;
‑ CTS_RXLEV_SUB_SERVING_CELL and CTS_RXQUAL_SUB_SERVING_CELL:\ RXLEV_SUB and
RXQUAL_SUB for the subset of 4 SACCH frames and the SID TDMA frames/L2 fill
frames defined in 8.3. If no FACCH frames have been received at the
corresponding frame positions, the RXQUAL_SUB report shall include
measurements on the 4 SACCH frames only. The performance requirements of
subclause 8.2.4 do not apply in this case for RXQUAL_SUB.
If the next SACCH message block is used for a different Layer 3 message, the
averaged data which would otherwise be sent in that block is discarded and a
new average started for the current block. i.e., any SACCH message will report
the average data for the previous reporting period only.
The CTS-MS shall also transmit a bit (CTS_DTX_USED) in the next SACCH message
block, which indicates whether or not it has employed DTX during the reporting
period. This bit shall be set even if just one burst in a TDMA frame in the
reporting period was not transmitted due to DTX.
NOTE: A speech frame subject to DTX may cross the \"border\" between two
reporting periods, in which case both of the associated SACCH message blocks
will have the CTS_DTX_USED flag set.
## 11.6 Control of CTS-FP service range
In order to restrict the CTS-FP service range, the CTS-FP shall monitor the
delay of the signal sent by from the CTS-MS. For each CTS-MS the CTS-FP has
allocated a TCH, a range measurement of the CTS-MS shall be computed by the
CTS-FP every five reporting period by averaging over five reporting periods
the assessed delay (as specified in 3GPP TS 45.010) for each received TCH
burst of the subset always to be transmitted, specified in subclause 8.3, and
for each received SACCH burst.
The TCH shall be released by the CTS-FP if two consecutive range measurements
are greater than 1 bit period.
## 11.7 Control parameters
The parameters employed to control the radio link are shown in table 4, 5 and
6.

# 12 COMPACT Mode Tasks
## 12.1 Introduction
COMPACT is a radio interface mode for inter cell synchronized systems. The
mapping of control channels for up to four cells is done on the same carrier
and control channel separation is achieved by transmitting control in
different cells on different timeslots. The mapping of the control channels is
specified in 3GPP TS 45.002.
The COMPACT Mode Tasks defined in this clause applies for COMPACT capable MSs
in cells employing a CPBCCH carrier as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002. The COMPACT
Mode Tasks also applies for MSs in any cell, where at least one CPBCCH is
defined in a BA list.
Note: A mobile stations designed prior to release 99 will not find CPBCCH
carriers when it is looking for a BCCH carrier due to to the different
structure of synchronization and frequency bursts.
## 12.2 Network Pre-requisites
### 12.2.1 CPBCCH carriers
The CPBCCH carrier shall be transmitted with constant RF output power on at
least 4 radio blocks per multiframe on the serving time group (see 3GPP TS
45.002).
## 12.3 COMPACT Idle Mode Tasks
### 12.3.1 Introduction
Whilst in idle mode, a COMPACT capable MS shall implement cell selection and
cell reselection procedures as described in 3GPP TS 43.022. These procedures
make use of measurements and sub-procedures described in this clause.
The procedures ensure that the MS is camped on a cell from which it can
reliably decode downlink data and with which it has a high probability of
communications on the uplink. Once the MS is camped on a cell, access to the
network is allowed.
The MS shall not use the discontinuous reception (DRX) mode of operation
(i.e., powering itself down when it is not expecting paging messages from the
network) while performing cell selection algorithms defined in 3GPP TS 43.022.
However, use of powering down is permitted at all other times in idle mode.
### 12.3.2 Measurements for COMPACT Cell Selection
An MS shall in the COMPACT Cell selection procedure search for CPBCCH
carriers. The MS shall search all RF channels in the system within its band of
operation, take readings of received RF signal level of each RF channel, and
calculate the RLA_ P for each. Each reading of received RF signal level shall
be performed in such a way that it corresponds to the RF level at occurrences
when the potential CPBCCH carrier is transmitting CPPCH, CSCH, CFCCH or CPBCCH
blocks. Since the CPBCCH carrier is discontinuous, a single random measurement
will not suffice. A single reading may instead consist of taking the maximum
value out of multiple measurements. The succeeding averaging is based on at
least five such measurement readings per RF carrier, where the readings are at
least 1 s apart. This procedure is referred to as a CPBCCH scan.
NOTE: It is allowed to only take readings of RF signal level of CPBCCH
carriers if identified.
CPBCCH carriers may be identified, for example, by searching for frequency
correction bursts and then synchronizing to and reading the synchronization
bursts at the prescribed offset from the PFCCH bursts (see 3GPP TS 45.002). On
finding a CPBCCH carrier, the MS shall attempt to read the CPBCCH data, taking
into account that the actual timeslot allocation of the CPBCCH will change
from multiframe to multiframe.
The maximum time allowed for synchronization to a CPBCCH carrier is 2.5
seconds. The maximum time allowed to read each system information message,
when being synchronized to the CPBCCH, is the time it takes to complete a
broadcast cycle of that message.
### 12.3.3 Measurements for COMPACT Stored List Cell Selection
The MS may include storage of CPBCCH carrier information when switched off as
detailed in 3GPP TS 43.022. The CPBCCH list may include CPBCCH carriers from
more than one band in a multi band operation PLMN. A MS may also store CPBCCH
carriers for more than one PLMN which it has selected previously (e.g. at
national borders or when more than one PLMN serves a country), in which case
the CPBCCH carrier lists must be kept quite separate. The stored BCCH carrier
information used by the MS may be derived by a variety of different methods.
As a minimum, the MS shall store the last used HPLMN CPBCCH carriers. A memory
shall host at least the 24 last CPBCCH carriers from the HPLMN that the MS has
camped on.
For a stored CPBCCH carrier list of the selected PLMN an MS shall perform the
same measurements as in subclause 12.3.2 except that only the CPBCCH carriers
in the list need to be measured.
NOTE: If the selected PLMN is equal to one of the equivalent PLMNs, then
stored list cell selection applies to all equivalent PLMNs.
If stored list cell selection is not successful, then as defined in 3GPP TS
43.022, normal cell selection shall take place. Since information concerning a
number of channels is already known to the MS, it may assign high priority to
measurements on the strongest carriers from which it has not previously made
attempts to obtain CPBCCH information, and omit repeated measurements on the
known ones.
### 12.3.4 Criteria for COMPACT Cell Selection
The path loss criterion parameter C1 used for cell selection and reselection
when in a COMPACT cell is defined by:
C1 = (A ‑ Max(B,0))
where
A = RLA_P ‑ GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN\ B = GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH ‑ P
> GPRS_RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN= Minimum received signal level at the MS required for
> access to the system.
>
> GPRS_MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH= Maximum TX power level an MS may use when accessing
> the system until otherwise commanded.
>
> P= Maximum RF output power of the MS.
All values are expressed in dBm.
The path loss criterion (3GPP TS 43.022) is satisfied if C1 > 0.
### 12.3.5 Downlink Signalling Failure
As defined for GPRS in subclause 6.5.
## 12.4 COMPACT Cell Reselection
In GPRS Standby and Ready states (_A/Gb mode_) or RRC-Idle or RRC-Connected
mode (_Iu mode_), cell reselection is performed by the MS. The cell
reselection procedures defined in this subclause apply when an MS is attached
in a cell with a CPBCCH carrier or monitors a cell with a CPBCCH (or both).
Otherwise, the MS shall perform cell re-selection according to subclause 10.1,
or if PBCCH does not exist according to subclause 6.6.
The cells to be monitored for cell re-selection, referred to as neighbour
cells, are defined in the BA(GPRS) list, which is broadcast on PBCCH or
CPBCCH. If PBCCH or CPBCCH does not exist, BA(GPRS) is equal to BA(BCCH).
### 12.4.1 Monitoring the received signal level and CPBCCH data
The MS shall measure the received RF signal level on the CPBCCH or BCCH
carriers of the serving cell and the surrounding cells as indicated in the
BA(GPRS) list and optionally the NC_FREQUENCY_LIST, and calculate the received
level average (RLA_P) for each carrier.
In addition the MS shall verify the BSIC of the neighbour cells. Only cells
with allowed BSIC shall be considered for re-selection. The allowed BSIC is
either a valid BSIC or, for cells in BA(BCCH) where no BSIC is broadcast, a
BSIC with allowed NCC part, (see subclause 7.2). A valid BSIC is a BSIC
broadcast for that carrier in the BA(GPRS) list.
#### 12.4.1.1 Packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state
Whilst in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state an MS shall continuously monitor
all BCCH and CPBCCH carriers as indicated by the BA(GPRS) list in the system
information of the serving cell. Note that both BCCH and CPBCCH carriers may
be defined in the BA(GPRS) list. At least one received signal level
measurement sample on each neighbour cell shall be taken for each paging block
monitored by the MS according to its current DRX mode and its paging group. As
the minimum MS shall take one measurement for each BCCH or CPBCCH carrier for
every 4 second. As the maximum, the MS is however not required to take more
than 1 samples per second for each neighbour cell. For CPBCCH carriers, only
the TDMA frames where common control or broadcast blocks are transmitted are
used for monitoring signal levels, see subclause 12.3.2.
RLA_P shall be a running average determined using samples collected over a
period of 5 s to Max {5s, five consecutive paging blocks of that MS}, and
shall be maintained for each BCCH or CPBCCH carrier. The same number of
measurement samples shall be taken for all neighbour cells, and the samples
allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly distributed
over the evaluation period. At least 5 received signal level measurement
samples are required for a valid RLA_P value.
The list of the 6 strongest non‑serving cells shall be updated at a rate of at
least once per running average period.
The MS shall attempt to check the BSIC for each of the 6 strongest non‑serving
cells at least every 14 consecutive paging blocks of that MS or 10 seconds,
whichever is greater. If a change of BSIC is detected then the cell shall be
treated as a new cell.
When requested by the user, the MS shall determine which PLMNs are available
as described in subclause 6.6.1. However, for MSs without DRX or with short
DRX period (see 3GPP TS 45.002), considerable interruptions to the monitoring
of PPCH can not be avoided.
#### 12.4.1.2 Packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state
Whilst in packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state a MS shall continuously
monitor all BCCH or CPBCCH carriers as indicated by the BA(GPRS) list and the
broadcast carrier of the serving cell. In every TDMA frame possible, a
received signal level measurement sample shall be taken on at least one of the
BCCH carriers or CPBCCH time groups, one after another, as evenly distributed
as possible among the neighbours. As an exception for CPBCCH carriers on
multislot allocations the MS shall take at least 4 received signal level
measurement samples for CPBCCH carriers from two different time groups (2
samples/time group) in every 52 multiframe, as evenly distributed as possible
among the neighbours. For CPBCCH carriers, only the TDMA frames where common
control or broadcast blocks are transmitted are used for monitoring signal
levels, see subclause 12.3.2.
RLA_P shall be a running average determined using samples collected over a
period of 5 s, and shall be maintained for each BCCH and CPBCCH carrier. The
samples taken on each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly
distributed over the evaluation period. At least 5 received signal level
measurement samples are required for a valid RLA_P value.
The MS shall attempt to check the BSIC for as many non‑serving cells as
possible and as often as possible, and at least every 10 seconds. The MS shall
use TDMA frame 51 of the PDCH multiframe for checking BSICs of CPBCCH carriers
and TDMA frame 25 or 51 for checking BSIC of BCCH carriers . These frames are
termed search frames. A list containing BSIC and timing information for these
strongest carriers at the accuracy required for accessing a cell (see 3GPP TS
45.010) including the absolute times derived from the parameters T1, T2 T3 or
R1, R2, TG shall be kept by the MS. This information may be used to schedule
the decoding of BSIC and shall be used when re-selecting a new cell in order
to keep the switching time at a minimum. When a BCCH or CPBCCH carrier is
found to be no longer among the reported, BSIC and timing information shall be
retained for 10 seconds. (This is in case a cell re-selection command to this
cell is received just after the MS has stopped reporting that cell, see
subclause 10.1.4.2).
If, after averaging measurement results over 4 PDCH multiframes (1 sec), the
MS detects one or more BCCH or CPBCCH carrier, among the 6 strongest, whose
BSICs are not currently being assessed, then the MS shall as a matter of
priority decode their BSICs.
The MS shall be able to send the first packet random access (PRACH) at the
latest 5+x seconds after a new strongest cell (which is part of the BA(GPRS))
has been activated under the following network conditions: Initial serving
cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then the new
CPBCCH or BCCH carrier is switched on at RXLEV= -60 dBm. x is the longest time
it may take to receive the necessary system information on CPBCCH or BCCH in
the new cell.
NOTE: Because of test equipment limitations it is acceptable to activate the
new carrier to replace one of the 6 neighbours.
In the case of a multiband MS, the MS shall attempt to decode the BSIC, if any
BCCH or CPBCCH carrier with unknown BSIC is detected among the number of
strongest CPBCCH carriers in each band as indicated by the Multiband Reporting
parameter (see subclause 8.4.3).
Thus an MS shall, for a period of up to 5 seconds, devote all search frames to
attempting to decode these BSICs. If this fails then the MS shall return to
confirming existing BSICs. Having re‑confirmed existing BSICs, if there are
still BCCH or CPBCCH carriers, among the six strongest, with unknown BSICs,
then the decoding of these shall again be given priority for a further period
of up to 5 seconds.
If either no BSIC can be decoded on a surrounding cells, or the BSIC is not
allowed, then the received signal level measurements on that channel shall be
discarded and the MS shall continue to monitor that channel.
If a change of BSIC is detected on a carrier, then any existing received
signal level measurement shall be discarded and the carrier shall be treated
as a new carrier.
If the BSIC cannot be decoded at the next available opportunities re‑attempts
shall be made to decode this BSIC. If the BSIC is not decoded for more than
three successive attempts it will be considered lost and any existing received
signal level measurement shall be discarded and the MS shall continue to
monitor that carrier.
### 12.4.2 COMPACT cell reselection criteria
The COMPACT GRPS mode cell reselection criteria follows the GPRS cell
reselection criteria described in subclause 10.1.2.
### 12.4.3 COMPACT cell reselection algorithm
The cell reselection algorithm for COMPACT follows the procedures described
for GPRS in subclause 10.1.3.
### 12.4.4 Network controlled Cell reselection
The network controlled cell reselection for COMPACT follows the procedures
described for GPRS in subclause 10.1.4.
### 12.4.5 COMPACT cell reselection measurement opportunities
COMPACT utilizes a timeslot mapping of control channel in a rotating fashion
as described in 45.002. With this timeslot rotation, a mobile can make COMPACT
neighbour cell measurements of all four time-groups. The timeslot that an MS
can use for measurements is dependent on the timeslot number used for traffic.
During one 52-multiframe, the MS is able to measure one time-group on up to 4
frequencies once per control block. During 1 s time period (4 multiframes),
the MS is able to measure all 4 time-groups .
The CPBCCH carrier shall be transmitted with constant RF output power as
defined in subclause 12.2.1, during a minimum number of control blocks. The
actual number of control blocks transmitted with constant RF output power in a
neighbour cell is indicated in the neighbour cell parameter
GUAR_CONST_PWR_BLKS, broadcast in with the neighbour cell description for an
EGPRS neighbour cell.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Definition of a basic GSM or DCS 1 800
handover and RF power control algorithm
# A.1 Scope
This annex specifies a basic overall handover algorithm and RF power control
process that may be implemented in the GSM or DCS 1 800 system.
The specification includes a set of algorithms that are sufficient to allow
the successful implementation of an initial GSM or DCS 1 800 system, and from
which more complex algorithms may be developed.
The basic solution is not mandatory for network operators.
# A.2 Functional requirement
The present algorithm is based on the following assumptions:
‑ single cell BSS;
‑ the necessity to make a handover according to radio criteria is recognized
in the BSS. It can lead to either an (internal) intracell handover or an
intercell handover;
‑ evaluation of a preferred list of target cells is performed in the BSS;
‑ cell allocation is done in the MSC;
‑ intracell handover for radio criteria (interference problems) may be
performed directly by the BSS;
‑ the necessity to make a handover because of traffic reason (network directed
handover) is recognized by the MSC and it is performed by sending a \"handover
candidate enquiry message\" to BSS;
‑ the RF power control algorithm shall be implemented in order to optimize the
RF power output from the MS (and BSS if power control is implemented) ensuring
at the same time that the signal level received at the BSS (MS) is sufficient
to keep adequate speech/data quality;
‑ all parameters controlling the handover and power control processes shall be
administered on a cell by cell basis by means of O&M. The overall handover and
power control process is split into the following stages:
i) BSS pre‑processing and threshold comparisons;
ii) BSS decision algorithm;
iii) MSC cell allocation algorithm.
A BSS decision algorithm is specified such that the BSS can fulfil the
mandatory requirement of being able to produce a preferred list of target
cells for handover.
It should be noted that since measurement results can also be sent to the MSC
in the \"handover required\" message, the handover decision algorithm may be
implemented in either the MSC or the BSS.
# A.3 BSS pre-processing and threshold comparisons
For the purpose of handover and RF power control processing, the BSS shall
store the parameters and thresholds shown in table A.1. These shall be
administered on a cell by cell basis and downloaded to the BSS by O&M
procedures.
The parameters and thresholds related to the downlink power control process
are stored and used only if BSS RF power control is implemented.
The following measurements shall be continuously processed in the BSS:
i) Measurements reported by MS on SACCH:
‑ Down link RXLEV;
‑ Down link RXQUAL;
‑ Down link surrounding cell RXLEV (RXLEV_NCELL (n) on BCCH as indicated in
the BCCH Allocation).
ii) Measurements performed in BTS:
‑ Uplink RXLEV;
‑ Uplink RXQUAL;
‑ MS‑BTS distance;
‑ Interference level in unassigned time slots.
Every SACCH multiframe (480 ms) a new processed value for each of the
measurements shall be calculated.
## A.3.1 Measurement averaging process
The BSS shall be capable of pre‑processing the measurements by any of the
following processes:
‑ Unweighted average;
‑ Weighted average, with the weightings determined by O&M
‑ Modified median calculation, with exceptionally high and low values
(outliers) removed before the median calculation.
The timing of the processing shall be controlled by parameters, set by O&M, as
follows:
a) RXLEV_XX (XX = DL or UL):
For every connection and for both links at least the last 32 samples shall be
stored (a sample is the value evaluated by the MS and BSS during a period of
480 ms). Every 480 ms, with these samples, the BSS shall evaluate the averaged
value of the received power as defined by the parameters Hreqave and Hreqt,
applicable to RXLEV.
b) RXLEV_DL on BCCH carriers (RXLEV_NCELL (n)):
For every connection and for each of up to 16 defined cells the BSS shall
store the values related to the last 32 samples. The BSS shall average these
samples as defined by the parameters Hreqave, Hreqt, applicable to RXLEV.
c) RXQUAL_XX (XX = DL or UL):
For every connection and for both links at least 32 samples shall be stored (a
sample is the value calculated by the MS and BSS during period of 480 ms).
Every 480 ms, with these samples, the BSS shall evaluate the received signal
quality as defined by the parameters Hreqave and Hreqt, applicable to RXQUAL.
d) MS‑BTS distance:
For every connection the BSS shall average the adaptive frame alignment value
as defined by the parameters Hreqave and Hreqt, to derive an estimate of the
MS‑BTS distance.
e) Interference level in unassigned time slots:
The BSS shall average the interference level in unassigned timeslots as
defined by the Intave parameter. The averaged results shall be mapped into
five interference categories (see 3GPP TS 48.008) whose limit O‑X5 are
adjusted by O&M.
f) Power Budget:
This assessment process may be employed by the network as a criterion in the
handover process, by setting a flag in the BSS by O&M command. If the process
is employed, every 480 ms, for every connection and for each of allowable 32
adjacent cells, the BSS shall evaluate the following expression:
PBGT(n) = (Min(MS_TXPWR_MAX,P) ‑ RXLEV_DL ‑ PWR_C_D) ‑ (Min(MS_TXPWR_MAX(n),P)
‑ RXLEV_NCELL(n))
Where the values of RXLEV_NCELL(n) and RXLEV_DL are obtained with the
averaging processes defined above. PWR_C_D is the difference between the
maximum downlink RF power permitted in the cell and the actual downlink power
due to the BSS power control. MS_TXPWR_MAX is the maximum RF TX power an MS is
permitted to use on a traffic channel in the serving cell. MS_TXPWR_MAX (n) is
the maximum RF TX power an MS is permitted to use on a traffic channel in
adjacent cell n. P is the maximum TX power capability of the MS.
g) Hreqave and Hreqt:
The values of Hreqt and Hreqave are defined by O&M for each cell for the
averaging of reported measurements. The values of Hreqave and Hreqt can be
different for each of the parameters being averaged.
Hreqave:
defines the period over which an average is produced, in terms of the number
of SACCH blocks containing measurement results, i.e. the number of
measurements contributing to each averaged measurement.
Hreqt:
is the number of averaged results that are maintained.
The BSS shall support values of Hreqave and Hreqt such that
0 \ O and PBGT(n) > HO_MARGIN(n) a handover, cause PBGT(n), might
be required.
This comparison enables handover to be performed to ensure that the MS is
always linked to the cell with the minimum path loss, even though the quality
and signal level thresholds may not have been exceeded.
# A.4 BSS decision algorithm
Recognizing the necessity to request a handover the BSS shall send a
\"handover required message\" to the MSC containing the preferred list of
target cells.
The \"handover required message\" shall be also generated in answer to a
\"handover candidate enquiry message\" sent by the MSC.
The BSS decision algorithm shall be based on the following strategy:
RXLEV_NCELL(n) > RXLEV_MIN(n) + Max (O, Pa) (A.1)
where: Pa = (MS_TXPWR_MAX(n)‑P)
(Min(MS_TXPWR_MAX,P) ‑ RXLEV_DL ‑ PWR_C_D) ‑(Min(MS_TXPWR_MAX(n),P) ‑
RXLEV_NCELL(n)) ‑ HO_MARGIN(n) > 0 (A.2)
All these expressions shall be evaluated using the averaged values defined by
the parameters Hreqt and Hreqave.
The BSS shall evaluate the equation (A.2) for each of the adjacent cells that
satisfies the expression (A.1) and shall compile the list of the preferred
adjacent cells ordinated depending on the value of equation (A.2) (i.e. in the
first position is the cell for which the value is the maximum, in the second
position is the cell with the second best value and so on).
If there are any adjacent cells for which the values of RXLEV_MIN(n),
HO_MARGIN(n) and MS_TXPWR_MAX(n) are not known, i.e. the MS has reported
values from an undefined adjacent cell, then the default parameters shall be
used to evaluate equations 1 and 2, i.e. RXLEV_MIN_DEF, HO_MARGIN_DEF,
MS_TXPWR_MAX_DEF. This enables handover to occur in situations where a call is
set up in unexpected coverage area of a cell, without defined adjacent cells.
If there are several cells that satisfy the equation (A.2) with the same
results, the first cell in the list will be that one with the best \"positive
trend\". The trend shall be evaluated by the BSS using the last Hreqt averaged
values of RXLEV_NCELL(n).
If the handover is considered imperative, that is one of the following events
is verified as the cause:
a) the power level (UL and/or DL) is below the thresholds despite power
control (the MS or/and the BSS have reached the maximum allowed power);
b) the quality of the link (UL and/or DL) is below the threshold while at the
same time the RXLEV approximates the threshold;
c) the distance between MS and BTS exceeds the MAX_MS_RANGE.
The list of the preferred cells shall be compiled including any candidates for
which the result of the equation (A.2) is lower than 0. Also in this case the
list shall be compiled in a decreasing order of priority.
## A.4.1 Internal intracell handover according to radio criteria:
(Interference problems)
The two conditions RXQUAL_XX > L_RXQUAL_XX_H (bad quality) and RXLEV_XX >
RXLEV_XX_IH, if verified at the same time, indicate a high probability of the
presence of co‑channel interference.
This situation can be solved by changing the channel within the cell with an
intracell handover.
If internal intracell handover is supported by the BSS it shall be performed
as described in 3GPP TS 48.008.
If the BSS does not support internal intracell handover, then the handover
shall be initiated by sending a \"handover required message\" to the MSC in
which the serving cell is indicated as first priority.
## A.4.2 Internal handover according to other criteria
Apart from radio criteria there are other criteria that may require internal
handover:
‑ O&M criteria;
‑ Resource management criteria.
In these cases, internal handover shall be triggered by the OMC or by the
resource management of the BSS.
## A.4.3 General considerations
Since the RF power control process and the handover process are closely
linked, particular care shall be taken in order to avoid undesired
interactions between them.
In particular, the following interactions should be avoided, where possible:
‑ a \"power increase command\" or a \"handover for RXLEV or for RXQUAL\"
subsequent to a \"power reduction command\" (e.g. by checking that the
averaged power level reduced by the Pow_Red_Step_Size plus the tolerances is
greater than the L_RXLEV_XX_P or L_RXLEV_XX_H);
‑ a \"power reduction command\" subsequent to a \"power increase command\".
After an action of power control the set of samples related to the previous
power level, in the corresponding link, shall not be used in the processing.
If, during the decision process, the condition for the \"handover required
message\" is satisfied at the same time by different reasons. The \"cause
field\" in the \"handover required message\" sent to the MSC, shall contain
the reasons taking account of the following order of priority:
‑ RXQUAL;
‑ RXLEV;
‑ DISTANCE;
‑ PBGT.
# A.5 Channel allocation
As described in 3GPP TS 48.008 the available channels shall be divided into
five interference categories whose limits O‑X5 are adjusted by O&M command.
For handover, the channel allocated should be from the category with the
lowest interference level, since determination of the expected value of C/I is
not possible by the new BSS.
# A.6 Handover decision algorithm in the MSC
The MSC shall select the cell to which an MS is to be handed over by the
following criteria:
‑ Handover for radio criteria shall be handled taking into account the
following order of priority:
‑ RXQUAL;
‑ RXLEV;
‑ DISTANCE;
‑ PBGT.
e.g. if there are more handover bids to a cell than there are free traffic
channels, then the bids with cause \"RXQUAL\" shall take highest priority.
‑ In order to avoid overload in the network, for every cell and with reference
to each of 16 adjacent cells, it shall be possible to define (by O&M) for each
adjacent cell one of at least 8 priority levels. These shall be considered
together with the list of candidates and the interference levels in the choice
of the new cell. For example, if there are two cells which meet the criteria
for handover, then the cell with the highest priority shall be used. This
enables umbrella cells, for instance, to be given a lower priority, and only
handle calls when no other cell is available.
‑ Channel congestion on the best cell shall cause the choice of the second
best cell, if available, and so on. If no cell is found and call queuing is
employed in the MSC, then the MSC shall queue the request on the best cell for
a period equal to H_INTERVAL (H_INTERVAL \ $\overline{P} = E\lbrack{\overline{u}}_{n}r_{n^{}}\rbrack$ denotes the _K_ x
> 1 cross-correlation vector between the complex symbols of Training Sequence
> and the received signal sample $\left{ r_{n} \right}$.
and ${\overline{u}}_{n} = \lbrack u_{n},u_{n -
1},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},u_{n - K + 1}\rbrack^{T}$.
_K_ will be decided based on the expected maximum equivalent channel
dispersion. Note that the equivalent channel corresponds to the combined
channel response of the physical channel and transmit and receive filter
responses. _K_ represents the number of symbols over which the equivalent
channel dispersion is spanning. _K_ = _L1_ +_L2_ +1.
STEP 2:
The interference and noise contribution (_IN_) is calculated for the last _M_
= 26-_N_ symbols of the Training Sequence as follows:
Note that the accuracy of the interference estimate will improve as _M_
increases, on other hand the channel estimate may suffer because of a reduced
_N_. Optionally, the symbols in the immediate vicinity on either side of the
Training Sequence may also be used in estimating interference.
STEP 3:
The above procedure may be performed in both the directions scanning Training
Sequence from left to right and right to left. By scanning in both the
directions, _IN_ can be obtained for the first M symbols, _IN1_ , and for last
M symbols, _IN2_. The interference measurement sample SS~CH,n~ is calculated
as follows.
SS~CH,n~ = (IN1+IN2)/2
###### ## Annex D (informative): Example Selection of Modulation and Coding
Schemes based on Link Quality Reports
The table below gives examples of Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selection
based on the reported link quality estimates 8PSK_MEAN_BEP and 8PSK_CV_BEP.
The selection is designed to maximise the link throughput. Further
optimisation e.g. for the IR mode is possible. In the same manner the MCS-1 to
MCS-4 can be chosen based on GMSK_MEAN_BEP and GMSK_CV_BEP and the Modulation
and Coding Schemes defined for EGPRS2 can be selected based on the defined
modulation specific measurements for MEAN_BEP and CV_BEP.
