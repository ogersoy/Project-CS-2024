# Introduction
Recently, the GSM network is seeing its greatest expansion due to the
increased demand for mobile voice services in emerging markets. Furthermore,
most of these emerging markets have densely populated cities and limited radio
spectrum. Thus the increase of voice capacity in the circuit switched domain
in an evolutionary manner is a key issue for operators in these markets.
To help operators in these scenarios to alleviate the strain on their
networks, new techniques are required to improve the voice capacity on the
basis of reusing existing network equipment and radio resource. These have
been investigated during the MUROS feasibility study and candidate solutions
proposed in this feasibility study are based on multiplexing two or more users
onto one time slot without degrading the speech quality. These solutions are
unlike the speech codec approach to increase network capacity by increasing
speech compression, e.g. multiplexing two GSM-HR mobiles onto one time slot
but rather to maintain the same speech encoding by multiplexing four GSM-HR
mobiles onto one time slot.
The Technical Report is structured in the following way:
Chapter 1 elaborates the scope of the MUROS feasibility study.
Chapter 2 and 3 contain usual elements like References, Definitions, Symobols
and Abbreviations.
Chapter 4 lists the defined performance and compatibility objectives for
MUROS.
Chapter 5 depicts the common working assumptions for the performance
evaluation of MUROS candidate solutions.
Chapter 6 to 9 contain the four candidate solutions for MUROS, in particular:
the candidate solution "Speech Capacity Enhancement using DARP" in Chapter 6
the candidate solution "Orthogonal Sub Channels for Circuit Switched Voice
Capacity Evolution" in Chapter 7
the candidate solution "Adaptive symbol constellation" in Chapter 8
the candidate solution "Higher Order Modulations for MUROS" in Chapter 9
Chapter 10 lists the proposed candidates for the new set of training
sequences.
Chapter 11 depicts aspects related to associated control channel design for
MUROS.
Chapter 12 provides a summary of the evaluation versus defined objectives for
each of the candidate solutions.
Chapter 13 finally draws conclusions.
# 1 Scope
The present document is an output of the 3GPP study item "Multi-User Reusing-
One-Slot" (MUROS) [11].
It contains a section describing the objectives of the Circuit Switched Voice
Capacity Evolution, and further sections presenting candidate techniques,
which are evaluated according to their potential related to voice capacity
improvement in GERAN. For this the design of a new set of training sequences
with improved cross correlation properties to the existing set of training
sequences is foreseen and expected to be evaluated. The study will also
include the investigation of different optimised pulse shapes for MUROS for
both the uplink and the downlink.

# 4 Objectives
The increase in user amount and voice traffic puts a huge pressure on
operators especially within populous countries. Furthermore, as voice service
price gets cheaper, most operators face the challenge to obtain efficient
utilization of hardware and spectrum resource. The following performance and
compatibility objectives are therefore defined for each MUROS candidate
technique.
## 4.1 Performance Objectives
Two performance objectives are defined.
### 4.1.1 Capacity Improvements at the BTS
**Objective P1:** The candidate techniques proposed under MUROS is expected to
increase voice capacity of GERAN in order of a factor of two per BTS
transceiver. The channels under interest for doubled voice capacity are both
full rate and half rate channels: TCH/FS, TCH/HS, TCH/EFS, TCH/AFS, TCH/AHS
and TCH/WFS with related associated signaling channels.
### 4.1.2 Capacity Improvements at the Air Interface
**Objective P2:** The objective is to further enhance the voice capacity of
GERAN by means of multiplexing at least two users simultaneously on the same
radio resource both in downlink and in uplink. The channels under interest for
doubled voice capacity are both full rate and half rate channels: TCH/FS,
TCH/HS, TCH/EFS, TCH/AFS, TCH/AHS and TCH/WFS with related associated
signaling channels.
The co-channel and adjacent channel interference increase with number of
users, which leads to the decrease of C/I and frequency reuse. The balance
between low frequency reuse and high timeslot reuse should be considered
carefully.
## 4.2 Compatibility Objectives
Five compatibility objectives are defined.
### 4.2.1 Maintainance of Voice Quality
**Objective C1:** The introduction of the candidate techniques proposed under
MUROS should not decrease voice quality as perceived by the user. In
particular a voice quality better than for GSM HR should be ensured.
This is due to the fact that in case of sub-channels, being allocated in the
same time slot within the same radio frequency, the influence of the
inevitable inter-channel interference (ICI) on voice quality and actual
proportion of the subscribers sharing the same time slot cannot be ignored.
### 4.2.2 Support of Legacy Mobile Stations
**Objective C2:** Support of legacy MS by candidate techniques proposed under
MUROS identifies a further MS related objective. No implementation impacts
shall be required for legacy MS types. First priority has the support of
legacy DARP phase 1 capable terminals, whilst second priority is given the
support of legacy GMSK terminals notsupporting DARP phase 1 capability.
### 4.2.3 Implementation Impacts to new Mobile Stations
**Objective C3:** The introduction of the candidate techniques proposed under
MUROS should change MS hardware as little as possible. Additional complexity
in terms of processing power and memory should be kept to a minimum for a new
MS.
### 4.2.4 Implementation Impacts to BSS
**Objective C4:** The introduction of the candidate techniques proposed under
MUROS should change BSS hardware as little as possible and HW upgrades to the
BSS should be avoided.
Any TRX hardware capable of multiplexing more than one user on a single ARFCN
time slot shall support legacy GMSK mobiles, this includes non-SAIC mobiles
and SAIC mobiles.
Impacts to dimensioning of resources on Abis interface shall be minimised.
### 4.2.5 Impacts to Network Planning
**Objective C5:** The impacts to network planning and frequency reuse shall be
minimised. Impacts to legacy MS interfered on downlink by the MUROS candidate
technique should beavoided in case of usage of a wider transmit pulse shape on
downlink. Furthermore investigations shall be dedicated into the usage at the
band edge, at the edge of an operator's band allocation and in country border
regions where no frequency coordination are in place.
# 5 Common Working Assumptions for Candidates Evaluation
This section lists the common working assumptions for the performance
evaluation of MUROS candidate techniques that were discussed and agreed at
GERAN#37 and are reflected in summary report [2].

## 5.2 Definition of Model for External Interferers for Link Level Evaluations
In this subsection the interferer models specifying the profiles related to
**external interferers** are described. External interferers are generated
outside the serving cell.
Note, absolute performance characterization is given preference for the
comparison to legacy TCH channel type for link performance evaluation.
As in [5] the link performance shall be evaluated for FER := 1%. Other FER
ratios may also be considered.
### 5.2.1 Synchronous Network Mode
The link performance per each MUROS candidate technique shall be specified for
the following synchronous interferer scenarios:
a) for a new MTS-1 (MUROS test) scenario with synchronous interferer.
Table 5-2: MUROS Test Scenario 1 (MTS-1) with single synchrnous interferer
+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+-------------+ | Reference | Interfering | Interferer | TSC | Interferer | | Test | Signal | relative | | Delay range | | Scenario | | power level | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+-------------+ | 1) MTS-1 | 1) | 1) 0 dB | 1) None | 1) no | | | Co-channel | | | > delay | | | > 1 | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+-------------+
**Whereby** the modulation for co-channel 1 will be either: GMSK or MUROS
type.
It should be noted, that at MUROS telco#3 the working assumption was agreed to
remove single 8-PSK interferer profile since the results by different vendors
did not show a major difference in performance compared to the case of a MUROS
type interferer. The same applies for scenarios under b) , c) and d).
**Interference performance shall be based on C/I for single external cochannel
inteferer, where C is related to the received power accumulated from all
subchannels in the serving cell and I to the received power of the single
external cochannel interferer.**
**b)** for a new MTS-2 (MUROS test) scenario with multiple synchronous
interferers.
Table 5-3: MUROS Test Scenario 2 (MTS-2) with multiple synchronous
interferers.

Whereby the modulation for co-channel 1 will be either: GMSK or MUROS type.
The modulation for co-channel 2 will be either: GMSK or MUROS type. The
modulation for adjacent 1 will be either: GMSK or MUROS. Only configurations,
where all interferers are using the same modulation type, are considered.
**Interference performance shall be based on C/I1 for multiple external
cochannel inteferers, where C is related to the received power accumulated
from all subchannels in the serving cell and I1 to the received power of the
dominant external cochannel interferer.**
### 5.2.2 Asynchronous Network Mode
The link performance per each MUROS candidate technique shall be specified for
the following asynchronous interferer scenarios:
a) for a new MTS-3 (MUROS test) scenario with asynchronous interferer.
Table 5-4: MUROS Test Scenario 3 (MTS-3) with single asynchrnous interferer.
+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+-------------+ | Reference | Interfering | Interferer | TSC | Interferer | | Test | Signal | relative | | Delay | | Scenario | | power level | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+-------------+ | 1) MTS-3 | 1) | 1) 0 dB | 1) None | 1) 74 | | | Co-channel | > *^)^ | | | | | > 1 | | | > symbols | +-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+-------------+ | *^)^ The | | | | | | power of | | | | | | the delayed | | | | | | interferer | | | | | | burst, | | | | | | averaged | | | | | | over the | | | | | | active part | | | | | | of the | | | | | | wanted | | | | | | signal | | | | | | burst. The | | | | | | power of | | | | | | the delayed | | | | | | interferer | | | | | | burst, | | | | | | averaged | | | | | | over the | | | | | | active part | | | | | | of the | | | | | | delayed | | | | | | interferer | | | | | | burst is 3 | | | | | | dB higher. | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+-------------+
**Whereby** the modulation for co-channel 1 will be either: GMSK or MUROS
type.
**Interference performance shall be based on C/I for single external cochannel
inteferer, where C is related to the received power accumulated from all
subchannels in the serving cell and I to the received power of the single
external cochannel interferer.**
**b)** for a new MTS-4 (MUROS test) scenario with multiple asynchronous
interferers.
Table 5-5: MUROS Test Scenario 4 (MTS-4) with multiple asynchronous

Whereby the modulation for co-channel 1 will be either: GMSK or MUROS type .
The modulation for co-channel 2 will be either: GMSK or MUROS type. The
modulation for adjacent 1 will be either: GMSK or MUROS. Only configurations,
where all interferers are using the same modulation type, are considered.
**Interference performance shall be based on C/I1 for multiple external
cochannel inteferers, where C is related to the received power accumulated
from all subchannels in the serving cell and I1 to the received power of the
dominant external cochannel interferer.**
#### 5.2.2.1 Interferer delay profiles
Interferer delay profiles for asynchronous network operation are foreseen to
be specified to model the asynchronous network operation merely on link level
in order to generate a specific link to system mapping table used by the
network simulator running in synchronous mode. This is aligned to the
proceeding in the SAIC Feasibility Study [5] as agreed at GERAN#38. The
specification of these interferer delay profiles is FFS.
A propsosal on interferer delay profiles has been submitted to the GERAN 1
Adhoc Meeting on MUROS on 8^th^/9^th^ April in AHG1-080049. The discussion on
these interferer delay profiles is ongoing.
### 5.2.3 Sensitivity limited scenarios
The link performance per each MUROS candidate shall be specified for
sensitivity with AWGN included both in DL and in UL. As agreed at GERAN#38 [6]
the SNR is used both for downlink and uplink for sensitivity performance.
Power backoff resulting from modulation specific peak to average ratio should
be taken into account and be included in the performance results. In order to
allow for a direct comparison with the reference case performance results
should be calibrated in such way that the power of all subchannels will be
accumulated and this total power then is used to define the SNR, both for DL
and for UL.
### 5.2.4 Frequency Offsets
In addition a distribution function for frequency offsets shall be taken into
account for each external interferer on DL. It shall be applied in alignment
to [5] as follows:
Normal distribution with N(50 Hz,17 Hz) for low band (850/900 MHz).
Normal distribution with N(100 Hz,33 Hz) for high band (1800/1900 MHz).
### 5.2.5 Uplink Interferer Profiles
In uplink the same profiles MTS-1 through MTS-4 for external interferers are
used. In addition the subchannels need to be modelled as described below:
The link level analysis shall be performed for discrete values of the
subchannel power imbalance ratios:
SCPIR = -15 dB, -10 dB, -5 dB, 0 dB, 5 dB, 10 dB, 15 dB.
Note at least the performance for the worst subchannel is to be shown.
In addition distributions shall be taken into account for the timing alignment
error of both subchannel transmissions and the frequency offset of paired
subchannel and of external interferers:
Timing alignment error: a distribution function based on 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0
symbol is used as follows:
a) Probability (0 symbols) = 50%.
b) Probability (0.5 symbols) = 25%.
c) Probability (1 symbol) = 25%.
Note for b) and c) in half of the cases the interferer on the paired
subchannel is advanced, and in half of the cases it is postponed related to
the signal in the wanted subchannel. Timing alignment error is selected on a
burst basis, i.e. independent between successive bursts.
Frequency offset for the paired subchannel and for each external uplink
interferer:
A distribution function for the frequency offset shall be taken into account
since the MS frequency accuracy is ±0.1 ppm on UL as follows:
a) Normal distribution with N(45 Hz,10 Hz) for low band (850/900 MHz).
b) Normal distribution with N(90 Hz,17 Hz) for high band (1800 MHz).
c) Normal distribution with N(95 Hz,17 Hz) for high band (1900 MHz).
Note, the CIR on uplink is defined as a relative figure for the wanted sub
channel under consideration as proposed in [7] and agreed at 3GPP GERAN#39.
## 5.3 Network Configurations
Both blocking limited and interference limited scenarios are being evaluated
to assess the performance of each MUROS candidate technique on system level.
Three network configurations named MUROS-1, MUROS-2 and MUROS-3 are depicted
in Table 5-6. Additional parameters for system performance evaluation are
contained in Table 5-7.

## 5.4 Channel Mode Adaptation
Channel mode adaptation is often used in real networks, e.g. when channel
conditions become worse at the cell boundary and switching to full rate mode
becomes necessary. It makes use of an intracell handover, which may in case of
MUROS be initiated more often due to bad signal quality than due to
insufficient signal power, and is based on the specified speech codecs in
Table 5-1. According to [4] a sophisticated channel mode adaptation comprising
switching between full rate and half rate channels is not required for the
purpose of comparing candidate techniques. Instead the following approach has
been agreed:
a) For comparison of the candidate techniques a non-MUROS / MUROS adaptation
as depicted in Table 5-8 below is applied:
Table 5-8: Channel Mode Adaptation for comparison of candidate techniques
* * *
**Channel Mode Adaptation** **Channel modes** Type A0 GSM HR (Reference case)
Type A1 GSM HR \ MUROS (GSM HR) Type B0 AFS 12.2 (Reference case) Type B1
AFS 12.2 \ MUROS (AFS 12.2) Type C0 AFS 5.9 (Reference case) Type C1 AFS
5.9 \ MUROS (AFS 5.9) Type D0 AHS 5.9 (Reference case) Type D1 AHS 5.9 \
MUROS (AHS 5.9)
* * *
b) For the complete candidate technique to be standardised, a channel rate
change between full rate, half rate and MUROS channel type and vice versa as
depicted in Table 5-9 needs to be evaluated:
Table 5-9: Channel Mode Adaptation for specification of the candidate
technique
* * *
**Channel Mode Adaptation** **Channel modes** Type E0 AFS 12.2 \ GSM HR
(Reference case) Type E1 AFS 12.2 \ GSM HR \ MUROS (GSM HR) Type E2 AFS

(Reference case) Type F1 AFS 5.9 \ AHS 5.9 \ MUROS (AHS 5.9) Type F2 AFS
5.9 \ MUROS (AFS 5.9) \ MUROS (AHS 5.9)
* * *
The impact on speech FER due to the usage of channel mode adaptation is
required to be taken into account in a vendor specific way.
## 5.5 System Performance Evaluation Method
The following proceeding was agreed to assess the maximum network capacity
gain:
  * Step 1: The system is loaded without usage of MUROS candidate technique until minimum call quality performance is not anymore ensured.
  * Step 2: The system is loaded with usage of MUROS candidate technique until minimum call quality performance is not anymore ensured.
  * Step 3: The performance in terms of network capacity is compared against each other according to the definition:
_Network Capacity Gain =_
$\frac{\text{Capacity}(\text{with}_{\text{MUROS}})}{\text{Capacity}(\text{without}_{\text{MUROS}})}$.
Two system performance capacity metrics listed in Table 5-10 are defined.
These will be used for BCCH layer, for TCH layer and for total capacity.
Table 5-10: Capacity metrics for MUROS evaluation
* * *
Capacity metric Unit Spectral efficiency Erl / MHz / Site HW Efficiency Erl /
TRX
* * *
Note, results should be given in terms of gains relative to the reference case
using legacy channel types only, as specified above in Table 5-8 and 5-9.
The evaluation should be done in such way, that switching between non-MUROS
and MUROS channel modes based on vendor specific channel mode adaptation
thresholds shall be optimized for each channel mode adaptation type and in
addition for each network configuration as specified above in Table 5-8 and
Table 5-9.
### 5.5.1 Definition of Effective Frequency Load for Mixed Frequency Reuse
The following definition is provided to clarify calibration of system
performance in terms of EFL in case of a mixed frequency reuse. This refers to
the case that both hard blocking and soft blocking performance of MUROS are
provided as function of EFL. A unique definition of EFL should be used
throughout the vendors for performance comparison. This is needed in
particular for network configurations like MUROS-1 and MUROS-2 including TCH
channels for MUROS on BCCH and hence employing a mixed frequency reuse based
on TCH layer and BCCH layer. This section proposes a unique definition for EFL
in case of mixed frequency reuse, given in the equation below.
$\text{EFL} = \frac{A}{N_{\text{Freq}} \ast
\text{av}(N_{\text{TS}_{\text{per}_{\text{TRX}}}})}$*100% ,
with _A_ being the supported traffic in Erl as determined by the simulation
(the equation is valid for FR and HR channel modes, taking into account either
full rate or half rate channel capacity as the number of supported
simultaneous connections for HR channel modes A and D is supposed to be higher
than for FR channel modes B and C in most cases), _N~Freq~_ the number of
total frequencies composed of the TCH layer and the BCCH layer and
_av(N~TS_per_TRX~)_ the average number of available full rate channels or time
slots per TRX derived from the total available timeslots for MUROS usage in
both layers and the total number of TRX.
An examplary determination of _EFL_ is given hereafter.
Let us assume the network configuration MUROS-1 with 1 BCCH carrier and 3 TCH
carriers. In this configuration the TCH layer uses a frequency reuse 1/1 with
9 frequencies equivalent to the length of the Mobile Allocation, whilst the
BCCH layer utilizes 12 frequencies based on frequency reuse 4/12. Further
assume both cases.
a) legacy full rate channel mode (e.g. C0) and
b) MUROS full rate channel mode (e.g. C1).
For both cases the average number of timeslots per TRX is given by
and the total number of frequencies is _N~Freq~_ =12+9=21.
This yields for both cases
$\text{EFL} = \frac{A}{\text{21} \ast 6\text{.}\text{75}} \ast
\text{100}\text{\%} = 0\text{.}\text{7055}\text{\%*}A$ ,
with _A~a~_ being the simulated supported number of simultaneous connections
for case a) and _A~b~_ the corresponent one for case b) for evaluation against
the hard blocking limit of 2% or against the soft blocking limit (average FER
for MUROS FR ≤ 2%, for MUROS HR ≤ 3%).
Note: Evaluation of EFL performance is optional in MUROS feasibility study.
## 5.6 Definition of Minimum Call Quality Performance
The following criteria for definition of minimum call quality performance were
agreed:
  * 1st Criterion: blocked calls \ channels compared against the traffic channel as derived in link > performance evaluation for a reference scenario shall be > maintained for MUROS channel types.
    * The reference scenario is defined as follows: DTS-2, DARP receiver, definition of mean performance offset of FACCH and SACCH channels.
      * applying corresponding fullrate codec type in case of MUROS fullrate codec.
      * applying cooresponding halfrate codec type in case of MUROS halfrate codec.
Note that the criterion on dropped calls has [not]{.underline} been included,
as the study is targeting on voice quality under the restiction of sufficient
performance of associated siganlling channels. Nevertheless it is left open to
the proponents of a candidate technique to add information on call dropped
call rate. Note the average call FER threshold has been relaxed from 1% to the
above values according to [6] at GERAN#38.
## 5.7 Link-to-System Mapping
An agreement has been achieved at 3GPP GERAN#39 not to investigate further for
DL and for UL the approach of a common Link to System Mapping approach based
on some proposals such as provided in [8] and [9].
Instead verification of L2S mapping in the MTS-1 to MTS 4 scenarios shall be
performed by each vendor.
  * The SCPIR envisaged for the operation of the candidate technique > shall be taken into account.
  * The evaluation shall be based on uncoded BER only.
The link to system mapping should be verified by the vendor through link level
simulations. All modulations used in the system simulations should be
verified.
## 5.8 Impairments of the Mobile Station
### 5.8.1 Subchannel power imbalance ratio on DL
Discussion at 3GPP GERAN#39 was based on contributions from different vendors
reporting performance degradation for legacy SAIC mobiles beyond a certain sub
channel power imbalance ratio. The reported range was about 8 to 10 dB.
Since performance was believed to be different for all mobile receivers,
vendors believed that it was difficult to agree on a specific value for the
maximum power imbalance. Taking this account in system simulations was felt to
be complicated as call quality is used as criterion for handovers and not the
power imbalance.
Mobile vendors were invited to report any limitations on the SCPIR at the next
MUROS telco#6. At MUROS telco#6 it was agreed to not specify a general
constraint on limitations related to acceptable subchannel power imbalance
ratios on terminal side and to take into account terminal performance in a
vendor specific manner.
### 5.8.2 Frequency Offset Impairment Model in UL
A proposal in [10] to define a lower figure than the current frequency offset
of 100 Hz was discussed based on the statement that 40 Hz would be a more
realistic assumption for the average frequency offset of each of both mobiles
in uplink subchannels. Mobile vendors were invited to report more realistic
figures for the expected frequency offset at the next MUROS telco#6. At MUROS
telco#6 a refined frequency offset impairment model on UL was agreed. This is
depicted in section 5.2.5.
## 5.9 Reference BTS Receiver
Discussion on introducing a reference BTS receiver type such as dual antenna
MRC or IRC during the MUROS feasibility study took place at 3GPP GERAN#39.
Different network vendors preferred the usage of different BTS receiver types.
It is agreed that a statement regarding the complexity of the evaluated BTS
receiver type for each vendor is included in the Technical Report. It was
considered as a limitation to the fesibility study to focus on a single BTS
receiver types, as some receiver types may serve one candidate technique
better than others. It was also agreed to identify the MUROS performance
benefit related to the reference based on the same BTS receiver type.
# 6 Speech Capacity Enhancement using DARP
## 6.1 Concept Description
### 6.1.1 Principle
DARP was specified to provide improved reception on the mobile station side
when there is ACI or CCI. However, with good downlink signal quality there is
little benefit from DARP. This concept uses this fact to enhance speech
capacity.
DARP can work quite successfully with CCI of 0dB. Therefore the network can
assign the same physical resources to two mobile stations but allocating them
different training sequence codes as depicted in Figure 6-1. Each mobile will
receive its own signal (shown in black in the figure) and that intended for
the other co-TCH user (shown in red in the figure).
On the downlink, each mobile station will consider the signal intended for the
other mobile station as a CCI. The receiving mobile station does not need to
support any other enhancements than DARP. For optimum DARP performance, the
two signals intended for the two different mobile stations should ideally be
phase shifted by π/2 for their channel impulse response but less than this
will also provide adequate performance.
On the uplink each mobile station would use a different training sequence
code. The network may use techniques such as joint detection to separate the
two users on the uplink.
Figure 6-1 Channel assignment for co-TCH operation
The above scheme is applicable to OSC signals (QPSK or alpha-QPSK) MUROS
signals. This is referred to in chapter 7 for OSC and in chapter 8 for alpha-
QPSK.
### 6.1.2 Downlink signal modulation schemes
DARP based co-TCH proposal is based on combining two base-band signals [6-1],
although RF combining also works for feasibility demo [6-2].
For future MUROS deployment one way of generating the DL signal is to linearly
combine the two GMSK baseband modulated signals and then feed into the RF
modulator and power amplifier for transmission as shown in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-2 Linear baseband combining for co-TCH
The DARP based co-TCH MUROS method also works with QPSK as well as GMSK
modulation schemes.
In this section a case analysis of three different types of MUROS modulation
schemes for DL signals and their spectrums is presented. They are
1\. Linear sum of two GMSK signals (90 degree phase separation),
2\. QPSK with liner Gaussian filter, and
3\. QPSK with RRC (roll off 0.3) filter.
#### 6.1.2.1 Equal power level between two desired users
When two DARP phones with similar path loss are paired as MUROS callers, the
power level provided to them should be the same.
The I-Q plots for the three modulations schemes are shown in Figure 6-3.
{width="3.073611111111111in" height="2.75625in"}
{width="3.1944444444444446in" height="6.35625in"}
Figure 6-3 Baseband IQ plots for three MUROS DL modulation schemes
It can be seen that two GMSK linear combination and QPSK with Linear Gaussian
filter have very similar I-Q plots.
#### 6.1.2.2 Spectrum analysis
The spectrum analysis of the above three MUROS DL schemes are shown in Figure
6-4. Some difference is observed when compared with reference [6-3] and need
further clarification.
{width="6.3284722222222225in" height="3.9243055555555557in"}
Figure 6-4 Spectrum analysis for three MUROS DL signal modulation schemes
The plots in Figure 6-4 show:
  1. QPSK with RRC filter (roll off 0.3) spectrum is 10 dB higher than the GMSK spectrum between 140-200 kHz, which could have advert effect for capacity enhancement. It is also wider than the spec defined GMSK mask for useful part of the burst, and will increase ACI interference.
  2. The linear combination of two GMSK signals has the same spectrum (curve overlapping) as normal GMSK signals as expected. It is within the spec defined GMSK mask for useful part of the burst.
  3. QPSK with Linear Gaussian filter (8PSK pulse shaping) is similar to GMSK.
Based on these observations, it is proposed that two GMSK linear combination
and QPSK with Linear Gaussian filter should be the candidates for MUROS DL
modulation scheme.
#### 6.1.2.3 Different power levels between two desired users
It has been found that when the two desired signal have different RF
strengths, non-zero crossing can be achieved. For example, linear combination
of two GMSK signals with different separation angles the IQ plots are as shown
in\ Figure 6-5.
{width="6.69375in" height="4.039583333333334in"}Figure 6-5 I-Q plots for
linear combination of two GMSK signals with different phase separation and 3dB
power difference between the two MUROS signals
This could be very useful for pairing a high performance DARP phone with a
non-DARP phone. We propose to use 90 degrees phase separation as simulation
showed that this achieves the best performance for two MUROS users.
### 6.1.3 Power control in co-TCH MUROS operation
In MUROS mode the power given to each user is based on their need, provided
that the power difference is within a suitable range (i.e. 10dB) to provide
sufficient signal quality for reliable reception by each mobile. As an
illustration of the MUROS concept based on DARP phase I mobile we can consider
the MUROS DL signal as a linear sum of two independent GMSK modulated signals.
Further more the modulation can be done at baseband as shown in Figure 6-6
below. Each baseband GMSK modulated signal is individually power controlled by
their gains (sinα and cosα ) and added together at baseband with relative
phase reference of π/2. Then the MUROS baseband signal is modulated with the
carrier as MUROS DL RF signal with a gain of G.
Figure 6-6: MUROS signal format concept with sub user power control
### 6.1.4 BTS changes for co-TCH MUROS operation
For baseband modulation the following changes are required:
Input port needs to have optional second voice channel, so that two voice
streams can be modulated to form MUROS DL signals.
The baseband modulator must be able to handle one- and two-channel binary
stream. The one-channel is the same as before. The two-channel function is
needed when MUROS mode is on, so that the RF output is effectively two legacy
RF signals, possibly of different power levels, linearly added together with
one rotated by 90 degree.
There are various ways of implementing the above requirements. In the examples
given below BTS needs the following two key parameters when sending downlink
RF bursts in MUROS mode:
  1. IQ stream of normalised scale, which suits the resolution and dynamic range of the DAC, and
  2. Appropriate power level of the burst, which drives the PA.
Here is an example what MUROS BTS needs to do based on Figure 6-6:
  1. From the path-loss of each of the two co-TCH mobiles, derive the required power level P1 for user 1 and P2 for user 2. Both P1 and P2 are linear quantities.
  2. Using P1 and P2, obtain the IQ amplitude ratio of the two users as follows: $R = \sqrt{\text{P2/P1}}$ (P1>0, P2>0).
  3. Determine the digital gains for each of the two co-TCH mobiles:
> For user 1, G1 = cos(α), and
>
> For user 2, G2 = sin(α),
>
> where α=arc tan(R) and $\alpha \in \lbrack 0,\frac{\pi}{2}\rbrack$
  1. Decide the Tx RF gain for the PA so that the Tx power level is
> P=P1+P2
Another example of achieving the same effect is:
  1. Align the two busts, and map user 1 and 2's burst level coded bits to I and Q respectively. On I-axis 0kG1, 1-kG1. On Q-axis 0kG2, 1-kG2, where k is a scalar factor represents G1 and G2 in fix point format with a satisfactory resolution.
Figure 6-7: Map two users' _i_ th bits on to QPSK considering power control of
both users
  1. Apply Pi/2 phase rotation on every symbol progressively (just like EGPRS 3Pi/8 rotation on every symbol).
  2. Apply Gaussian linear filter to satisfy the GSM spectrum mask.
Both of the above approaches give the same spectrum. Simulations based on both
above schemes have the same performance.
Examples of baseband IQ trajectory have been described in section 6.1.2.3.
In the case of one mobile in DTx mode, the corresponding gain control (G1 or
G2) is simply set to 0 (in linear term, not dB) while the other gain control
is set to 1. If both users are in DTx mode then both gain controls are set to
0.
### 6.1.5 Adaptive pulse shapping for MUROS modulation
The MUROS study has showed that the VAMOS mode of operation needs adaptation
of a few parameters to make reliable and good voice services when two users
are on one slot. These adaptations are, but not limited to, codecs (AMR, FR,
HR etc), FH to introduce user diversity, power imbalance to give suitable
levels of RF signal to each VAMOS user and increase the pairing range and
providing suitable RF condition for legacy handsets (both DARP and non-DARP)
to perform. This section proposes a further VAMOS physical layer adaptation
scheme, _an adaptation of pulse shaping while keeping the VAMOS signal within
the GMSK mask_. The benefit is that _both users can improve their performance_
by a couple of dB in the example of 5 dB power imbalance on FR.
Two VAMOS paired handsets could have different need of RF power, and require
different C/I. Therefore their power ratio could be different from unity.
Hence the BTS would send VAMOS signal with the power imbalance (+10 dB to -10
dB per MUROS working assumption) intended for the two users.
As shown in Figure 6-7a, is an improvement of the second approach. It has the
same mapping shown in Figure 6-6, and introduces different pulse shaping on
the two paired users' baseband signal. The Pulse shaping A and B are related
with the power imbalance and adaptive to the β parameter. For the low RF power
user, the pulse shaping can be root raised cosine (RRC) filter and with
broader bandwidth than the high powered user, while the sum of the two is
still within the existing GMSK mask.
{width="5.7625in" height="2.4854166666666666in"}
Figure 6-7a - Adaptive QPSK modulation with pulse shaping adaptation (A and B)
For a simple example, if user 2 is further away from the BTS than user 1, and
user 2 has 5 dB more power than user 1, the power imbalance is user 1/user 2 =
-5 dB, then pulse shaping A for user 1 can be RRC with broader bandwidth than
shaping B for user 2, as user 1 has weaker RF signal than user 2.
VAMOS signals can use a family of RRC pulse shapes (filters) that have
different bandwidths to adapt to different power imbalance cases. LGF/GMSK can
be considered as the default pulse shaping/modulation. The principle of
adaptive pulse shaping is that the user with weak RF signal can use broader
bandwidth pulse shaping, while the user with strong RF signal has narrow
bandwidth pulse shaping when suitable. It is suggested that the total sum
satisfies the GMSK mask as the cell planning is based on that. In this way
VAMOS can make better use of allocated resource more efficiently and improve
their performance without introducing considerable CCI or ACI to others
without considering other users in the heavily loaded areas.
The benefits of the above adaptation scheme benefit both VAMOS users:
  1. For a weaker one that has broader bandwidth it will have better performance. This is because the RF energy per symbol is stronger than a narrow one, e.g. the conventional method (GMSK or LGF) on the user with less indented Tx power (the weak RF user with DARP handset);
  2. The user with big intended Tx power (the strong RF user, in the worst case without DARP handset) will have better performance, as the RRC will minimize the ISI to the intended user and the interference to the other user.
Our link level simulation results showed that it has double benefits. Numerous
verifications have been made to come to the above conclusions.
To illustrate the points above, one example of VAMOS pulse shaping adaptation
can be a broader RRC on weak user and one LGF on strong user, where both VAMOS
users have their performance improved by a couple of dBs. Simulations have
been carried out with and without pulse shaping adaptation.
Pulse Shaping Adaptation has following conditions:
  1. User 1, with greater RF power (say 5dB) than user 2, on LGF pulse shaping, and
  2. User 2, with less RF power (correspondingly -5 dB) than user 1, on RRC pulse shaping.
Figure 6-7b shows the two pulses considered in time domain.
{width="5.763194444444444in" height="4.322222222222222in"}
Figure 6-7b - Two pulse shaping used in VAMOS adaptation
Figure 6-7c shows the spectrum of relevant aspects, from which we can see that
this VAMOS pulse shaping adaptation satisfies the GMSK mask.
{width="5.986805555555556in" height="3.386111111111111in"}
Figure 6-7c - VAMOS spectrum satisfies the GMSK mask: Spectrum of adaptive
QPSK VAMOS signal with a RRC pulse shaping on weak signal and a linearised
Gaussian pulse shaping (LGF) on strong signal -- power imbalance 5dB.
Figure 6-7c shows the performances of both VAMOS users on the two schemes: one
with VAMOS pulse shaping adaptation (the red curves - dots and diamonds), and
the one only apply LGF, without VAMOS pulse shaping adaptation (the blue
curves -- stars and crosses).
The pulse shaping adaptation shows that both VAMOS users have improved their
performance by about 3 dB when comparing with VAMOS LGF pulse shaping (see the
two red curves are better than the two blue ones).
Figure 6-7d - MTS1 Performance improvement between the cases with and without
VAMOS pulse shaping adaptation
In general the widths of the pulse shaping functions can be linked to the
power imbalance ratio. The bigger the power imbalance, the broader the weak
one can have. The adaptation is to use RRC and the sum of the two has a
spectrum (with PA impairment) that respects the GMSK mask.
In practice a series of pulse shapes can be stored and indexed with the power
imbalance decision made by the RRM (radio resource manager). It needs just
hundreds of words of memory to hold the coefficients of different pulse
shapes, and emploies a pointer that changes with the power imbalance decision
made by the BTS between the two VAMOS users.
In theory the pulse shaping adaptation on DL can be changed every frame. This
may be used in frequency hoping case when user diversity is introduced.
However in non-FH cases it may change based on SACCH report period, and then
the adaptation may happen every 480 ms or 120 ms with enhanced report
mechanism. The actual rate of adaption is flexible, from every frame to
keeping them constant as it is currently. It is related with the two handsets
RF conditions at the time of voice services as well.
This contribution proposes that the a few RRC filters together with LGF and
GMSK can be stored and adaptively used with different power imbalance cases on
adaptive QPSK VAMOS modulation signal. The scheme will keep the total spectrum
of the two inside the GMSK mask. Simulation shows that both users will benefit
from this adaptation. In the example of worst case (legacy DARP and non-DARP),
both have been improved by 3 to 4 dB in MTS1.
Since this scheme make better use of allocated spectrum in certain cases it
may introduce slightly more CCI and ACI, especially to the next sector on the
same site. However the point of adaptation is to explore the option so that
optimum benefit can be obtained. It should be noted that the pulse shaping can
be narrower as well as broader than the conventional one. So the CCI and ACI
are managed in adaptive way to reach a better performance for both VAMOS users
and beyond.
Although the simulation result presented has not taken PA impairment into the
consideration, the area where PA impairment happens are deliberately left with
a realistic margin. It is expected that the adaptation concept introduced here
would adapt to the situation in practice. While a small offset might be
expected due to reality limitations, adaptation will improve the relative
performance of the same situation, as shown in this contribution for the case
presented.
Since there are clear benefits on both VAMOS users, it is proposed that VAMOS
modulation adaptation should include the use of different RRC pulse shapes
together with GMSK/LGF with regard to different level of power imbalance while
the GMSK mask is respected. We hope other companies to verify this proposal
and work together to explore the benefit of pulse shaping adaptation.
## 6.2 Performance Characterization
### 6.2.1 Link Level Performance
The performance of a DARP Phase 1 receiver is evaluated under the various
configurations defined in chapter 5. The legacy training sequence set and the
Nokia training sequence (section 10.1.1) set was used in these simulations. A
MUROS capable mobile is assumed to support new training sequence codes, in
this case the new TSC set proposed in section 10.1.1. The legacy DARP Phase 1
mobile is assumed to support the legacy TSC set.
Configuration for link level simulations
The simulation configuration for MTS and sensitivity scenarios is shown in
Table 6-1 below. In this configuration both co-TCH users have the same power
level.

The link level sensitivity performance of MUROS (two user relative power of

However it should be noted that with restricted bandwidth the frequency
hopping improvement can be far less.

Figure 6-9: DARP Phase 1 mobile performance in sensitivity condition with TU3
The results show, as expected, that TU3 introduces 10dB degradation to static
case, a major impact to sensitivity performance. However ideal FH improve it
by 5 to 7dB.

Figure 6-10: DARP Phase 1 mobile performance in sensitivity condition with
TU50
TU50 introduces 5 to 7 dB degradation to static case and ideal FH improves by
1 dB, not as much as with TU3.
The conclusion is that MUROS works well in static condition but will have 10dB
degradation for worst fading channel which means TU3 does need frequency
hopping.
#### 6.2.1.2 Interference performance
##### 6.2.1.2.1 MTS-1 configuration
The link level performance for MTS-1 configuration is shown in Figure 6-11 and
Figure 6-12.

Figure 6-12: DARP Phase 1 mobile performance in MTS-1 scenario with TU50
The spec point for a DARP Phase 1 receiver with GMSK modulated signal is also
shown on the second graph in Figure 6-12. As can be seen that the performance
of a DARP Phase 1 receiver with MUROS signal is around 3-4dB worse for GSM FR,
AFS5.9 and AHS5.9 codecs with iFH, which is reasonable as two users are
supported simultaneously by the same radio.
It is clear that even in MUROS mode DARP mobile can still suppress CCI by
further 4 to 6 dBs compared with AWGN as MTS-1 has coloured noise.
As expected with ideal frequency hopping, both TU3 and TU50 performing equally
well. Without frequency hopping, on the other hand, TU3 degrades by 6 to 10
dB, and TU50 by 2 dB compared to the static case.
##### 6.2.1.2.2 MTS-2 configuration
The link level performance for MTS-2 configuration is shown in Figure 6-13 and
Figure 6-14.

{width="7.123611111111111in" height="2.925in"}
Figure 6-14: DARP Phase 1 mobile performance in MTS-2 scenario with TU50
The results show that MTS-2 is about 1 to 2 dB worse than AWGN, this means
that when the interference type is mixed CCIs and ACIs, it is even harder than
AWGN for DARP receiver to deal with. As usual, iFH would provide 4 to 9 dB
improvement in TU3 channel.
##### 6.2.1.2.3 MTS-3 configuration
The link level performance for MTS-3 configuration is shown in Figure 6-15 and
Figure 6-16.

#### 6.2.1.3 Link level performance with power imbalance
This section shows the link level performance with power imbalance for the two
co-TCH users. Following effects have been studied:
  1. On both paired users, both DARP with DARP and DARP with non-DARP;
  2. The different TSCs;
  3. Two codecs of AFS5.9 and HR;
  4. Different fading channels, including TU50 with iFH;
  5. Different cases of sensitivity and MTS1;
The configuration for the link level simulation is shown in Table 6-2.

#### 6.2.1.4 SACCH performance on MUROS and non-MUROS
Signalling is an important part of MUROS operation. SACCH has a special
importance for maintaining the radio link for voice service. For the purposes
of comparison, SACCH performance for non-MUROS and MUROS are studied with
reference to five other codecs here.
##### 6.2.1.4.1 Non-MUROS and MUROS Sensitivity Performance
Figure 6-25 shows SACCH performance simulated with non-MUROS (Con.) and MUROS
(0dB) modes in static, TU50 and TU3 channels with ideal frequency hopping.
{width="6.0in" height="4.625in"}
Figure 6-25: DARP Phase 1 mobile SACCH sensitivity performance with static,
TU3, TU50 channels and iFH on non-MUROS and MUROS (C1/AWGN)
Firstly, as expected with ideal FH, TU3 and TU50 are about the same.
Secondly, SACCH does not have strong FEC, and can degrade pretty quickly with
poor RF conditions. This is shown by
  1. The 7 dB degradation from static to TU channel in non-MUROS mode.
  2. The 6dB degradation on static channel from non-MUROS to MUROS mode.
  3. The 3 dB degradation from non-MUROS to MUROS mode on TU channel (with ideal frequency hopping).
For comparison with the non-MUROS case, Figure 6-25 has been plotted without
considering the total power, which would be 3 dB more for this case.
{width="5.763194444444444in" height="4.322222222222222in"}
Figure 6-26: DARP Phase 1 mobile MUROS (0dB) SACCH/TCHes performance
comparison in TU3 iFH
For comparison of SACCH and TCH's Figure 6-26 shows that SACCH with equal
power MUROS for the pair would perform slightly worse than AHS5.9, and more
than 6 dB worse than AFS5.9. This means that
  1. MUROS mode, as expected, near the cell edge is generally not as good as close to the cell centre.
  2. If MUROS is used in sensitivity limited case, on AFS, SACCH could be the weakest link. Alternative power imbalance and repeated SACCH would be helpful with 4 to 5 dB gain.
  3. SACCH sensitivity performance is similar to AHS5.9 in MUROS mode (15 dB EbNo).
It is expected that HS and AHS are going to be the main focus on MUROS mode
and the above shows that it should fine for DARP phone working in MUROS mode
when they are not near the cell edge.
##### 6.2.1.4.2 Non-MUROS and MUROS Interference Performance
To understand the relative performance degradation between voice codecs and
SACCH in non-MUROS and MUROS mode, DTS-1, DTS-2, MTS-1 and MTS-2 are simulated
at link level for five codecs and SACCH. Furthermore, link level simulation
results for SACCH, AFS5.9 and AHS5.9 in DTS-1 and DTS2 scenarios have been
verified in the lab. All link level MUROS simulations were performed 0dB power
imbalance.
In the figures below, the RF conditions are normalised to SACCH 2% FER point
in order to see the relative performance of five codecs in both non-MUROS
(i.e. DTS) and MUROS (i.e. MTS) modes.
Note that the SACCH performance in each case will be the same irrespective of
the speech codec.
{width="5.763194444444444in" height="4.322222222222222in"}
Figure 6-27: DARP Phase 1 mobile SACCH/TCH's performance in DTS-1 scenario
with TU3 iFH
In non-MUROS mode, with just one CCI (DTS1), SACCH performance is only 3 dB
better than AHS5.9, but worse than other codecs listed above. However for HR
it is only about 1 dB worse. This shows the same conclusion: SACCH cannot
match some of the good AFS codecs. So in such cases repeated SACCH would be
very helpful, as 4 to 5 dB gain can be obtained.
{width="5.763194444444444in" height="4.322222222222222in"}
Figure 6-28: DARP Phase 1 mobile SACCH/TCH's performance in MTS-1 scenario
with TU3 iFH
In the case of MUROS (0dB pairing) MTS1, SACCH performance stays relatively
the same (or slightly worse) to other codecs with regards to DTS1. This means
that there is no new SACCH issue when MUROS mode is used. In both MTS1 and
DTS1 repeated SACCH would help. Compare with AHS5.9 and HR it is not going to
cause major issue if RRC does good job on selecting the MUROS pair in the
first place.
{width="5.763194444444444in" height="4.322222222222222in"}

with TU3 iFH
{width="5.763194444444444in" height="4.322222222222222in"}
Figure 6-30: DARP Phase 1 mobile SACCH/TCH's performance in MTS-2 scenario
with TU3 iFH
When comparing DTS2 with MTS2, SACCH performance seems better relatively to
other codecs in MTS2 than DTS2. This is due to the case that DTS2 and MTS2 is
not a good case for DARP to perform, and all codecs performance drop more than
SACCH, as SACCH does not have very good FEC anyway to take the advantage of
better condition.
This shows that in non-MUROS mode (i.e. DTS-2) the SACCH performance is about
6 dB worse than the AFS5.9, while in MUROS mode (i.e. MTS2 ) it is about 4 dB
worse than AFS5.9, and becomes better than other four codecs listed above.
Although SACCH may be the weak link, the condition under which MUROS can
perform well would have this condition anyway.
It is clear that SACCH performance is not as good as performance of some AMR
codecs. But if MUROS is going to be used with HR and AHS, then SACCH is about
the same performance and should be fine. In case SACCH needs to be improved,
following method can be used:
  1. Repeated SACCH could give 4 to 5 dB gain.
  2. Alternatively giving high power for SACCH could be used to help the one in trouble.
  3. Time offset of SACCH frame between neighbor cells to avoid SACCH shouting together. This could help in this case of synchronized network.
It is also true that SACCH should not be expected to be the same performance
in order to maintain the voice service. It has a wider range of acceptance by
the network.
### 6.2.2 Network Level Performance
#### 6.2.2.1 System Setup and Configurations
The performance of a DARP Phase 1 receiver [6-2] is evaluated via system
simulations for the various configurations and working assumptions defined in
this TR. The system simulator provides snapshot system performance using a 19
site, 3 cells/site wraparound layout. The simulator completely models both
fast and slow fading between each receiver and transmitter. However the
simulator does not model mobility and handoff. The simulation results should
be interpreted as average snapshot system performance for that particular
configuration.
The system parameters of interest are reproduced below in Table 6-3.
Table 6-3: Different network configurations for MUROS system simulations
##### 6.2.2.1.1 Enabled features for system simulations
The system simulation was run with the following features included:
Table 6-4: Common configuration parameters for all MUROS modes

For the different scenarios, the system was simulated to determine the maximum
number of supportable channels per sector satisfying the FER criterion
specified in this TR. The voice call arrival process as specified in this TR
is separately accounted for to determine the Erlang capacity. In case of 100%
penetration, there is only a single queue of users and the relation between
maximum number of supportable channels and Erlang capacity is given by the
following equation:
$B_{\rho} = \frac{(\rho\frac{)^{N}}{N}!}{\sum_{i =
0}^{N}{(\rho\frac{)^{i}}{i}!}}$,
where$\rho$is the Erlang capacity, $N$ is the number of voice channels that
can be supported without violating FER constraints (obtained through
simulation), and$B_{\rho}$is the blocking probability. Erlang capacity is
determined for$B_{\rho} = 0\text{.}\text{02}$. In case of less than 100%
penetration, there are two queues of users and the arrival process is
separately simulated to determine the Erlang capacity based on maximum number
of supportable users determined using system simulations.
This approach is relatively simple and has merits over modeling the arrival
and departure process in system simulations which are already computationally
and memory intensive. Since the mean voice call service time is 90 seconds,
simulations would need to be run for extremely long durations to reliably
model the statistical arrival/departure processes and to average out the
short-term statistical variations. Otherwise the results can be greatly
affected by simulation noise.
##### 6.2.2.1.2 Simulated Channel Mode Adaptations
Maximum system capacity was determined for each audio codec in both single-
user and MUROS modes. For the current set of results being presented, dynamic
codec/rate adaptation was not considered.

and TU50 channel models and for each antenna pattern. The configurations where
MUROS shows capacity gains are highlighted in green.

The results for MUROS-1 show 30-100% gains in Erlang capacity in the cases of
TU50 with 65^o^ antenna pattern. With TU3 however, it is not possible to
increase voice capacity with MUROS in cases where users have less resilient
codecs (AFS 12.2 and AHS 5.9). The performance under the 90^o^ antenna pattern
is marginally worse than that achieved with 65^o^ antenna pattern.

In the MUROS-2 configuration with 100% penetration, gains are possible with
all codecs and channel types. With TU50, spectral efficiency gains of greater
than 100% are possible and the achievable gains are limited by blocked calls
in all cases. With TU3, gains as high as 90% are possible. There is little
difference in observed results with different antenna patterns.

In MUROS-3a, 60-125% capacity gains are achievable with MUROS for all codecs
and channel types with TU 50 channel model. With TU3 capacity gains are
observed only in the cases of GSM HR and AFS 5.9. Also worth noting is that
MUROS-3a shows the highest achievable spectral efficiency values among all
simulated deployment scenarios. This explains why there are cases where all
TRX can not be maximally utilized even without MUROS. There are slight
differences in performance between 65^o^ and 90^o^ antenna patterns, though
the differences are marginal.

With MUROS-3b, modest gains are observed with three of the four codec cases
under the TU50 channel model (19 -- 125%). With TU3 channel model, however,
the capacity gains are seen only in the case of AFS 5.9, depending on the
antenna pattern under consideration. The antenna pattern significantly affects
performance in MUROS-3b and call quality limitations are observed with lesser
numbers of users than in the corresponding cases of MUROS-3a.
##### 6.2.2.2.5 MUROS-2 with less than 100% penetration
In this setup we only consider the 65^o^ antenna pattern with the half rate
codecs (GSM HR and AHS 5.9).

We see gains in all penetration cases with MUROS because DARP receiver types
can be paired with MUROS mobiles without loss of performance. Though the
channel allocation algorithm avoids pairing of MUROS mobiles with non-DARP
mobiles, the random arrival sometimes lead to large number of non-DARP
mobiles. In certain scenarios, the channel allocation algorithm even pairs
MUROS mobiles with non-DARP mobiles with good received signal strength.

In calculation of percentage gains in Table 6-27, the reference receiver ratio
is always 0/70/30, though we don't expect the legacy performance to change
with any mix ratio in MUROS-2 deployment scenario, and so the percentage gains
will remain same.
#### 6.2.2.3 Performance Summary
Generally, the results for TU-50 channel performance exceed TU-3 performance
results for each MUROS configuration and channel mode pair. Significant gains
with MUROS are observed in almost all deployment scenarios with TU-50. By
comparison, the TU-3 channel lacks short-term time diversity and many users
struggle to meet the minimum FER criteria in cases with tight reuse.
We do observe significant MUROS gains even in TU-3 in deployment scenarios
which are not inherently interference limited, notably in the low-reuse
MUROS-2 configuration. More modest gains are observed in tighter network-
planned frequency reuse scenarios such as MUROS-3a, when paired with the AFS
5.9 codec, and to a lesser extent with the GSM HR codec.
MUROS-1 and MUROS-3b are reuse 1:1 deployments, and the system becomes
interference limited, especially when less robust codecs (such as AFS 12.2,
AHS 5.9) are assigned across all users in the cell. The interference
limitations of 1:1 frequency reuse patterns are most acutely seen in the
MUROS-3b configurations (which also lack BCCH scheduling). In MUROS-3b, as
with MUROS-1, frequency hopping results in interference averaging. However,
the antenna patterns used in all configurations do not provide adequate inter-
cell interference suppression (maximum of 20 dB from the neighboring cells of
same site). The 90^o^ antenna pattern provides worse performance than 65^o^
antenna pattern due to increased inter-cell interference. The DARP receiver
provides some interference cancellation but its gains become limited when
multiple high interference components are present.
In contrast, the network frequency planning (1:3 reuse) of MUROS-3a provides a
measure of intra-site interference avoidance from neighbor cells that the
similar MUROS-3b configuration lacks. As a result, for equivalent levels of
traffic loading, users across the system suffer significantly in the 1:1 reuse
scenarios of MUROS-3b.
We also see that MUROS provides observable benefits when co-existing in
deployments with older legacy handsets. For differing levels of MUROS
penetration, our results show the general determining factor for system
capacity gains remains the channel blocking. The MUROS gains are significant
even at lower levels of penetration, with the biggest marginal capacity
increase seen between 25% and 50% levels of penetration.
### 6.2.3 Performance Summary
Two GMSK linear combine and QPSK with 8PSK pulse shaping used for EDGE are
similar and keep the spectrum unchanged. They should be the candidate for
MUROS DL signal modulation.
MUROS operation needs a few dB margin when compared with current GSM spec
points. It is necessary for MUROS operation to work under comparatively better
RF condition than normal operation (one caller on one slot) as expected. When
the condition of the RF channel become less favorable to MUROS, network should
switch the DARP phone back to its normal operation in which the DARP
capability can be used for cancelling interference from other cells, as it was
intended originally.
Together with the originally intended DARP application, MUROS mode will make
better use of DARP capability and enhance the capacity by 100% without
changing the traditional frequency planning. Network system level study will
be necessary to give in-depth indication of capacity gain under various
conditions.
### 6.2.4 Verification of Link to System Mapping
This section depicts verification results for the employed Link to System
mapping for this candidate technique as agreed at GERAN#41.
## 6.3 Impacts on the Mobile Station
The co-TCH concept requires that one of the two mobile stations must support
DARP Phase 1. It is not necessary for the two mobiles to support new training
sequence codes provided the network assigns a different TSC to each of the two
mobile stations and these two training sequence codes are not used by
neighbour cells which use the same frequency (ARFCN).
For new mobiles it is desirable to support the new TSC set in addition to the
existing TSC set so that network has more flexibility in selecting TSCs. The
new TSC set is required to have minimum cross-correlation properties with
legacy TSC set. Therefore, it is proposed that MUROS capable mobiles support
new TSC set and legacy TSC set. In order to support the use of this new TSC
set, Radio Resource signalling changes would be required.
## 6.4 Impacts on the BSS
### 6.4.1 Impact on BTS transmitter
For MUROS operation, baseband modulator has to have
  1. Abis bandwidth that can carry twice as much as the voice data before MUROS deployment.
  2. Two voice channel inputs that can be activated with any of four combinations, i.e.
a. both user1 and 2 are on (MUROS mode);
b. both user1 and 2 are off (MUROS mode with both user on DTx);
c. user1 is on, and user 2 is off (either conventional mode, or user 2 is in
DTx); and
d. user1 is off, and user 2 is on (either conventional mode, or user 1 is in
DTx).
> If in conventional mode or one user is in DTX mode, then BTS only transmits
> GMSK for one user only. If both users are in DTx mode, no downlink
> transmission is needed for this burst.
  1. Two different TSCs that are applied to corresponding streams of burst payload when necessary, according to above user 1 and 2 configuration on burst by burst basis.
  2. New baseband combining function (could be implemented as FW function).
  3. The RF Tx needs linear PA that is capable of handling small percentage of zero crossings. Those BTS that has 8PSK Tx capability would also be suitable.
When both channels are activated, the baseband modulator can take both streams
of binary data with two different TSCs applied to corresponding payload
streams, and modulate them in such a way that:
  1. It satisfies the GMSK mask defined in spec.
  2. They are effectively the linear sum of the two independent burst signals that can be well received by legacy mobile stations. For the best channel separation, 90 degrees phase shift between the two independent bursts are needed.
The two signals for each MUROS caller can be of different amplitudes.
### 6.4.2 Impact on BTS receiver
The receiver needs to be able to decode the two GMSK modulated signals that
are separated by a TSC. There are number of BTS receiver techniques that can
be employed to provide adequate performance on the uplink, such as duel
antenna, joint detection. In general BTS receiver performance is better than
MS receiver performance.
### 6.4.3 Impact on Radio Resource Management
Radio Resource Management (RRM) is considered the most vital component in
voice capacity enhancement. RRM has to:
  * Determine the most appropriate users to pair together. This may involve the power requirements of each user; the rate of power change; signal quality
  * Power control is a crucial part to provide maximum benefit from MUROS mode of operation. Power control can allow users with varying channel conditions to be kept in MUORS mode for longer. Fast power control (i.e. Enhanced Power Control) can be valuable for MUROS mode operation.
  * Determine most appropriate point to un-pair users. This has to be a balance between maintaining call quality and spectral efficiency.
In order to support pairing and un-paring of users BSS can use existing
procedures to move users from one TCH to another (i.e. intra-cell handover
command or assignment command). It is down to BSS implementation which is
used.
## 6.5 Impacts on Network Planning
With increased air interface capacity there would inevitably be a need to
increase Abis bandwidth. The Abis bandwidth would need to be dimensioned to
support the maximum air interface users. For example, if air interface
supports twice as many full rate users then Abis interface would also need to
double the bandwidth. The timeline for upgrading Abis to support additional
users depends on the deployment of MUROS capable mobiles, as proportion of
MUROS capable mobiles increase, the Abis bandwidth would need to be increased
accordingly.

# 7 Orthogonal Sub Channels for Circuit Switched Voice Capacity Evolution
## 7.1 Concept description
### 7.1.1 Overview
A new study item MUROS [7-1] was agreed at GERAN#36 aiming to improve voice
efficiency. In this section the orthogonal sub channel (OSC) [7-2] concept is
presented. It multiplexes two MSs simultaneously allocated on the same radio
resource. OSC is applicable for low end handsets, since the concept is relying
on GMSK capability of handsets. Sub channels are separated by using non-
correlated training sequences. OSC can considerably increase voice capacity
with low impact to handsets as well as to networks. The concept may provide
e.g. a double half rate channel providing that 4 users can be allocated to the
same radio slot.
The orthogonal sub channel concept in downlink is based on QPSK like
modulation, where each of the sub channels is mapped so that it can be
received as GMSK signal.
In uplink direction, mobiles allocated to the orthogonal sub channels may use
the genuine GMSK modulation with different training sequences. Both orthogonal
sub channels are simultaneously received by the BTS that needs to employ e.g.
diversity and interference cancellation means to separate the orthogonal sub
channels.
In general, the OSC concept relying on GMSK only handsets can offer up to
double voice capacity.
The orthogonal sub channel concept by nature doubles the number of channels.
One of the key changes is the introduction of new training sequences paired
with existing training sequences for lowest cross-correlation to enable
separation of sub channels. The first sub channel can use an existing training
sequence serving a legacy MS, whilst the second sub channel should preferably
use a new training sequence for both downlink and uplink.
OSC can be applied e.g. for TCH/F, TCH/H and related associated control
channels (FACCH and SACCH) making it as transparent as possible to deploy it
for all GMSK modulated traffic channels.
### 7.1.2 Downlink concept
The downlink concept is depicted in this section. It is splitted into a basic
concept and into an enhanced concept.
#### 7.1.2.1 Basic OSC concept
##### 7.1.2.1.1 Mapping of user bits using QPSK modulation
The Basic OSC concept is characterized in downlink in that BTS transmitter
uses QPSK type of constellation that may be e.g. a subset of 8PSK
constellation used for EGPRS. Modulating bits are mapped to QPSK symbols i.e.
"dibits" e.g. so that the first sub channel (OSC-0) is mapped to MSB and the
second sub channel (OSC-1) is mapped to LSB as illustrated below.
An example of mapping bits to QPSK like constellation based on 8PSK modulator
is shown in Table 7-1 and Figure 7-1. Both sub channels are mapped to QPSK
symbol orthogonally.

This is illustrated in Figure 7-1.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="2.31875in"}
Figure 7-1: Mapping of OSC modulating bits into 8PSK symbols.
Both sub channels may use individual ciphering e.g. A5/1 or A5/3. The symbol
rotation of π/2 used in downlink allows multiplexing with legacy handsets and
enables also to use GMSK in case of DTX and FACCH / SACCH signalling, see
sections 7.1.2.1.5, 7.1.2.1.6 and 7.1.2.1.7.
##### 7.1.2.1.2 Burst structure, training sequence, tail and guard bits
The burst structure should be compatible with the existing bursts. Existing
GMSK tail bits and guard bits could be applied for both sub channels
separately. The set of new training sequences dedicated to the second sub
channel are paired with current training sequences for the lowest cross-
correlation with optimal autocorrelation and are listed in Table 7-2. The
training sequences have been obtained by performing a full LS channel
estimation based cumputational search [7-2].

##### 7.1.2.1.3 Tx pulse shaping filter
Different Tx pulse shaping filters were used in DL simulations such as Hanning
windowed Root Raised Cosine with roll-off 0.3 and bandwidth equivalent to
symbol rate (270 kHz) and the legacy linearized GMSK pulse. Link performance
characterization for above Tx pulse shapes can be found in section
7.2.1.1.1.1.
In addition it is worth to consider further optimisation of the Tx pulse shape
with different criteria e.g. system performance and MS receiver performance by
defining candidate pulse shapes as depicted below. Performance
characterization for these candidates for the optimized Tx pulse shape can be
found related to link performance in section 7.2.1.2.1.1.3 and related to
system performance in section 7.2.2.2.7 .

###### # 7.1.2.1.3.2 Comparison of Filter Characteristics
The characteristics of both candidates for the optimized Tx pulse shape and of
the reference LGMSK pulse shape are depicted in Table 7-2c.
Table 7-2c: Filter characteristics for used candidate pulse shapes.
* * *
**dB** **ACP 1** **ACP 2** **PAR** Legacy GMSK 18.2 > 50 TBD Candidate OPT 1
13.8 > 50 TBD Candidate OPT 2 15.6 > 50 TBD
* * *
Note. The second adjacent channel protection for both candidate pulse shapes
is below 50 dB, hence fulfilling the requirement of 50 dB in 45.005 (this
latter figure was obtained from simulations that used a realistic PA model).
##### 7.1.2.1.4 Symbol rotation
For symbol rotation the compatibility with GMSK makes rotation of π/2 the best
choice. Thus with above specified RRC filter the peak to average ratio (PAR)
is only 2.2 dB, whilst being 3.4 dB for linearised GMSK pulse.
##### 7.1.2.1.5 DTX handling when one sub channel is inactive
When the paired sub channel is inactive due to DTX, it is possible to send
normal GMSK bursts instead of QPSK for the active sub channel using the
training sequence of the active sub channel. The transmit power can be reduced
during that period of time. The change of modulation applies after sending the
last burst of the SID_FIRST message or of the SID_UPDATE message,
respectively, on the paired sub channel. Similarily, the change from GMSK to
QPSK applies when the first burst of the SID_UPDATE or ON_SET message,
respectively, needs to be sent on the paired sub channel. In system point of
view this OSC scheme has a different behaviour in DTX mode in downlink.
Combined transmitter activity will be higher than for single user, but on the
other hand two users are served simultaneously.
##### 7.1.2.1.6 FACCH signalling
Different options exist for transmission of FACCH for orthogonal sub channels
in downlink:
  * First option is to straightforward apply the FACCH signalling as for legacy channels, but mapped to the sub channels.
  * Second option is to steal voice payload bursts from both OSC sub channels to make signalling more robust e.g. for speeding up intra cell handovers. In this case the training sequence of the sub channel, transporting the GMSK modulated FACCH, is being used for discrimination.
  * Third option is to employ Repeated DL FACCH per sub channel, which has been standardised for full rate and half rate channels in GERAN Rel-6.
  * Fourth option is to use Soft Stealing for FACCH employing sub channel specific power control (see section 7.1.2.2.3).
Performance comparision between all three proposals is FFS.
##### 7.1.2.1.7 SACCH signalling
SACCH performance for OSC full rate traffic channels and OSC half rate
channels needs to be designed such that RR signalling carried on downlink gets
sufficiently robust.
In case of OSC full rate channels different options exist in downlink:
  * First option is to straightforward apply the SACCH signalling as for legacy channels, but mapped to the subchannels. Hence the SACCH blocks of both subchannels are simultaneously transmitted.
  * Second option is the usage of Repeated SACCH as standardized in GERAN Rel-7 for full rate traffic channels. This option is suited if legacy mobiles supporting Repeated SACCH are multiplexed on both sub channels, but also in case new OSC aware mobiles are multiplexed or for a mix of legacy mobiles supporting Repeated SACCH and OSC aware mobiles.
  * Third option is to shift the SACCH transmission for new OSC aware mobiles by 13 TDMA frames to the curent idle frames. Hence new OSC aware mobiles use the SACCH allocation related to the second channel in a half slot channel configuration. This is depicted in section 7.1.2.2.5.3 for the Optimized User Diversity Full Rate Pattern 1. Hence using GMSK modulated bursts for SACCH/F the same perfomance as for legacy mobiles is achieved.
In case of OSC half rate channels different options exist for SACCH in
downlink:
  * First option is to straightforward apply the SACCH signalling as for legacy channels, but mapped to the sub channels. Hence the SACCH blocks of both sub channels are simultaneously transmitted.
  * Second option is the usage of Repeated SACCH as standardized in GERAN Rel-7 for half rate traffic channels. This option is suited if legacy mobiles supporting Repeated SACCH are multiplexed on both sub channels, but also in case new OSC aware mobiles are multiplexed or for a mix of legacy mobiles supporting Repeated SACCH and OSC aware mobiles.
  * Third option is to use Soft Stealing for SACCH with sub channel specific power control and user diversity (see section 7.1.2.2.4). This option does only exist if at least one OSC aware mobile is multiplexed.
Performance comparision between all three above proposals is FFS.
#### 7.1.2.2 Enhanced OSC concept
The Enhanced OSC concept is based on three techniques which complement the
Basic OSC concept and thus increase the performance benefits of OSC in that
the interworking to legacy mobiles is improved and increased network capacity
is achieved.
##### 7.1.2.2.1 Sub channel specific power control
As proposed in [7-3] power control in downlink needs to be performed commonly
for both sub channels i.e. based on the highest power demand of two users. Two
individual radio path losses or receiver performances may not always be
balanced, thus sub channel specific power control needs to be addressed. The
enhancement is related to a sub channel specific power control mechanism based
on non-square, but rectangular 4QAM constellation provided by 8PSK
constellation. The sub channel specific power control utilises normal 8PSK
constellation with rotation changed to π/2. Power levels can be adjusted by
changing the mapping of users in that different subsets of 4QAM symbols are
selected out of the 8PSK constellation diagram as depicted in Figure 7-3.
{width="6.440972222222222in" height="2.2020833333333334in"}
Figure 7-3: Mapping of OSC sub channels with equal or unequal sub channel
powers
The OSC sub channel with higher power may experience about 2.3 dB higher power
than with equal power OSC and the OSC sub channel with lower power about 5.3
dB lower power, compared to the equal power case, whilst the difference
between higher and lower power is 7.7dB. By alternating between 3 different
levels from burst to burst it is possible to achieve effectively several level
values in within 7.7 dB range. The mapping of encoded bits of both subchannel
onto 8PSK constellation points for subchannel specific power control is
specified in Table 7-3.

###### 7.1.2.2.5.3 Support of Optimized User Diversity for scenarios with
mixed MS types
For OSC half rate channel configuration and OSC full rate channel
configuration three user diversity patterns for each are defined for each to
support inclusion of legacy MSs. Half rate configuration is always related to
one time slot, whilst full rate configuration is based on two timeslots in two
of three configurations in order to obtain a higher interference diversity.
**Optimized User Diversity Half Rate Pattern 1**
The channel configuration depicted in Table 7-6 is related to one timeslot.
The configuration supports of up to four users for the following two
scenarios:
a) 4 legacy MS's.
b) 3 legacy MS's + 1 OSC aware MS.

an OSC aware MS. In this case the SACCH for OSC User 2 is allocated in Frame

###### 7.1.2.2.5.4 Benefits of Optimized User Diversity
Optimized User Diversity will mitigate the drawbacks of the Basic User
Diversity proposal in the context of impact of variable speech block delivery
and of coexistence scenarios with legacy mobiles. Different patterns for full
rate and half rate channells have been designed in such way
  * that they allow to apply the same constant interleaving depth for full rate channels (8 bursts) as for legacy channels,
  * that they allow to apply the same constant interleaving depth for half rate channels (4 bursts) as for legacy channels and an reduced transfer delay by 5ms (30 ms instead of 35 ms) and
  * that they can serve a variable mix of legacy and new OSC aware mobiles with least signalling. In particular signalling support for new OSC aware mobiles will be needed to index the user diversity pattern and the position of the user, hence a total of 4 bits per user. The method for this signalling support is FFS.
As outlined in [7-4] the proposed method will yield increased interference
diversity both for TCH and SACCH channels in OSC configurations and is
independent of employed frequency hopping type. Hence no frequency planning
aspects are imposed by the introduction of the user diversity concept.
Performance characterization is given in section 7.2.2.2.5. The described
enhancement above is foreseen to be used together with the basic OSC candidate
technique. Furthermore it is to be noted, that the concept is equally
applicable to other candidates like co-TCH and alpha-QPSK.
### 7.1.3 Uplink concept
The uplink concept for OSC includes a subset of changes for the downlink. In
particular two independent uplink transmissions are simultaneously received at
the BTS. In the following the aspects of modulation and burst structure, usage
of new training sequences and Tx pulse shapes, definition of associated
control channel structure and application of the user diversity scheme are
considered.
#### 7.1.3.1 Modulation and burst structure
Modulation (i.e. GMSK) and burst structure (normal burst) are the same as for
legacy traffic channels.
#### 7.1.3.2 Usage of new training sequences
The mobiles use normal GMSK transmitter with OSC sub channel specific training
sequence. Hence both sub channels can be distinguished by their training
sequence, similarily as for downlink. A pair of legacy TSCs is used for legacy
mobiles, whilst new OSC aware mobiles use new training sequences as depicted
in section 7.1.2.1.2 . Training sequence on uplink is always identical to that
employed for downlink.
#### 7.1.3.3 Tx pulse shape
Different Tx pulse shapes may be used in uplink as proposed for downlink.
Whilst the reuse of the GMSK pulse shape is proposed for the initial OSC
concept, investigations on an optimized Tx pulse in uplink are FFS.
#### 7.1.3.4 Associated control channels
FACCH transmission for full rate and halfrate OSC channel is identical to the
legacy channel case.
SACCH transmission for full rate OSC channel may use option 1, 2 or 3 as
depicted in section 7.1.2.1.7 for downlink.
SACCH transmission for half rate OSC channel may use option 1 or 2 as depicted
in section 7.1.2.1.7 for downlink. In addition a third option is to use time
shift of the SACCH channel as proposed for user diversity (see section
7.1.2.2.5.3, optimized user diversity half rate pattern 3).
#### 7.1.3.5 User diversity
The user diversity scheme applied for downlink should also be used in uplink,
i.e. the optimized user diversity pattern should be identical. Hence a
signalling command refering to the user diversity pattern to be used on DL is
also related to UL.
#### 7.1.3.6 BTS receiver
BTS receiver may use e.g. Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) or Joint
Detection (JD) to receive signals from two mobiles on simultaneous sub
channels with individual propagation paths. Thus, the uplink scheme can be
seen as a 2x2 Multi User MIMO, where different propagation paths from two
users provide the basis to fully utilize the degree of freedom of two receive
antennas in typical BTS.
### 7.1.4 RR signalling
The following changes to RR signalling are needed:
  * MS should provide OSC radio access capability indication.
  * Channel assignment should include OSC sub channel information, e.g. > in form of the new or the existing training sequence code number > (4 bits).
  * Channel assignment should include the specified user diversity > pattern (2 bits for OSC FR channel and 2 bits for OSC HR channel) > and the index for the mobile (2 bits) in case of user diversity > support.
## 7.2 Performance Characterization
### 7.2.1 Link Level Performance
Link performance is characterized for sensitivity and for interference limited
scenarios [7-2],[7-6],[7-7]. Simulations are performed for full rate and half
rate AMR channels using some selected codec rates. Following fading radio
channel profiles at GSM900 band are used:
• Typical urban, terminal speed 3 km/h, ideal frequency hopping (TU3iFH),
• Hilly terrain, terminal speed 100 km/h, ideal frequency hopping (HT100iFH).
Sensitivity and DARP test scenario-2 (DTS-2) are considered as noise and
interference distortions, respectively. The baseline downlink receiver model
is according to a generic DARP Phase 1 mobile station. OSC service is
simulated with the same unmodified receiver. OSC signals are generated by
mapping the users on QPSK constellation with equal transmission power between
the sub channels. Signal rotation of π/2 is used. Tx pulse shaping is done
according to Linearized GMSK pulse shaping filter, also the performance of
alternative pulse shapes is evaluated.
#### 7.2.1.1 Sensitivity Performance
For performance measurement the frame erasure rate (FER) is displayed over the
signal to noise ratio (SNR).
##### 7.2.1.1.1 Sensitivity in downlink
Results are presented for the case of equal power on the subchannels (SCPIR =
0 dB) in subsection 7.2.1.1.1.1 and for the case of unequal power on the
subchannels in subsection 7.2.1.1.1.2 .
###### 7.2.1.1.1.1 Sensitivity in downlink without sub channel specific power
control
Different receiver types have been assumed such as DARP phase 1 with usage of
legacy TSC's on both subchannels, with usage of new TSC on paired subchannel
and OSC aware receiver benefitting from the knowledge of the training
sequences employed on both subchannels.
**Performance for DARP Phase 1 receiver and legacy training sequences**
Legacy training sequence codes are applied to the sub channels, in that legacy
training sequence pair TSC0 and TSC2 has been used. In Figure 7-6 and Figure
7-7 the downlink sensitivity performance of OSC is evaluated for some codecs
of AMR Full Rate (AFS) and AMR Half Rate (AHS) without and with ideal
frequency hopping respectively.

In Figure 7-8 the downlink sensitivity performance of OSC is evaluated for
different transmit pulse shaping filters. Simulated pulse shaping filters are
Linearized GMSK filter and Root Raised Cosine filters with normalized
bandwidths of 180, 240 and 270 kHz. Sensitivity performance is clearly
improved with RRC filters.

km/h radio propagation channel is evaluated against reference.

Figure 7-9: DL sensitivity FER performance in HT100iFH of generic DARP phase 1
MS\ receiving an OSC sub channel with AMR FR 5.9 and 12.2
It is shown that the performance of a legacy DARP 1 MS receiving an OSC sub
channel is adequate in average network conditions, and more robust AMR
channels can also provide sufficient coverage. Sensitivity would be
significantly improved by more optimum transmit filter than Linearized GMSK
filter. MUROS downlink concept also works in difficult radio propagation
conditions, but the usage of high rate AMR codecs is limited to good SNR
region.
**Performance for a DARP phase 1 receiver in case of a new training sequence
on paired sub channel**
Furthermore investigations with a non-OSC aware type of receiver, such as a
DARP phase 1 receiver have been carried out using different Tx pulse shapes
(linearized GMSK, RRC 270 kHz) for the case of reusing the existing TSCs and
the case using a new set of TSCs as proposed in section 7.1.2.1.2 for the
paired sub channel. Results are reported in Figure 7-10.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="4.092361111111111in"}
Figure 7-10: FER versus SNR for AMR FR 5.9 at TU3 iFH for DARP phase 1
receiver and usage of legacy TSCs only or mix of legacy and new TSC's
It can be seen that the performance loss related to legacy full rate both
depends on the Tx pulse shape and the used set of TSCs for the paired sub
channel. The performance loss is depicted in Table 7-12.
Table 7-12 Link Performace and Loss to Reference for AMR FR 5.9 @ FER=1%

Configuration SNR for FER=1% Loss to Reference GMSK (Reference) 1.9 dB - RRC

x-correlation 5.4 dB 3.5 dB Linearised Gaussian, new TSC pair 7.0 dB 5.1 dB
Linearised Gaussian, existing TSC pair with highest cross-correlation 7.9 dB
6.0 dB
* * *
**Performance for OSC aware receiver and usage of new training sequences**
The FER versus SNR is shown in Figure 7-11. It can be seen that OSC would need
about 2.6 - 3.2 dB higher Es/No for doubled capacity in sensitivity limited
scenarios, i.e. Eb/No is about the same as for related GMSK service, depending
on the receiver type (2.6 dB for OSC aware receiver and 3.2 dB for DARP phase
1 receiver).
Since QPSK in downlink may need to reduce transmitter power compared to GMSK
due to higher PAR by 2.2 dB in case of RRC pulse shape, further due to the OSC
aware receiver, i.e. the receiver which has knowledge about the training
sequences of both sub channels using this information for channel estimation
of the paired interfering sub channel and which needs 2.6 dB higher Es/No,
this yields a 4.8 dB lower link budget for doubled capacity in case of
sensitivity limited scenarios. For comparison AMR HR 5.9 needs about 7dB
higher Es/No than AMR FR 5.9, thus fullrate orthogonal sub channel could
improve HR coverage by about 2 dB in TU3 iFH. Whilst for GMSK legacy AMR, TX
pulse shape was assumed to be linearised GMSK, RRC filter with 3 dB double
sided bandwidth of 270 kHz was assumed in use for OSC FR, if not otherwise
stated. Both receivers, named 'GMSK' and 'GMSK RX for OSC' in the figures
below, are SAIC type receivers. Performance of non-DARP phase 1 legacy MSes is
FFS.

aware receivers with RRC270 TX pulse shape in case of OSC
###### 7.2.1.1.1.2 Sensitivity in downlink with subchannel specific power
control
In this section, simulation results are shown to verify how the SAIC (i.e.
DARP phase 1) and non-SAIC mobiles behave in the sensitivity limited cases
when receiving signals on downlink with sub-channel power control. TU 3 ideal
frequency hopping channel is simulated under sensitivity limited conditions
with AWGN noise interferer. It can be seen from Figure 7-12 that the
performance of SAIC mobile both on strong and weak channels using the
rectangular constellation points possible with 8-PSK modulator is acceptable.
Also from Figure 7-13, it can be seen that legacy non-SAIC mobiles can also
decode the OSC signal in downlink if they are multiplexed on the stronger
channel. It should be noted that all the bursts used a rectangular
constellation here (i.e the case of maximum power imbalance between the
subchannels). Further granularity in power control steps could be obtained by
varying the constellation diagram as depicted in section 7.1.2.2.2 but this
exercise is not repeated here. Further, it can also be noted that as long as
the mobiles are multiplexed on the strong channel, the performance of the
legacy mobiles with and without SAIC in sensitivity limited scenarios is quite
close as seen from the performance of user 2 -- who is the stronger user in
Figure 7-12 and Figure 7-13.

##### 7.2.1.1.2 Sensitivity in uplink
For uplink sensitivity simulations a SIC receiver has been used (Successive
Interference Cancellation). Performance for IRC receiver type (reference) and
SIC receiver is shown in Figure 7-14 for different level offsets between
coincident users, i.e. SCPIR = -20dB ... +10dB (related to wanted subchannel).
FER values are normalized values so that reference AMR HR 7.4 exhibits 1% FER
at SNR = 0 dB. It seems that about 2.6 dB loss in coverage is experienced when
other orthogonal signal is 10dB higher than wanted signal when SIC receiver is
used. At higher SNR levels higher offsets are tolerated. For SCPIR = - 20 dB,
a performance loss of almost 6 dB is observed compared to the reference.

Figure 7-14: UL sensitivity FER performance of a SIC receiver receiving\ an
OSC sub channel with AMR HR 7.4 in dependence of SNR
OSC concept evaluation in uplink shows that low complexity SIC equalizer can
support two subchannels with 2-3 dB difference to the single user uplink
channel for SCPIR between -10 dB...10 dB, and even somewhat higher ratios can
be tolerated with moderate SNR performance loss.

Different receiver types have been assumed such as DARP phase 1 with usage of
legacy TSC's on both subchannels, with usage of new TSC on paired subchannel
and OSC aware receiver benefitting from the knowledge of the training
sequences employed on both subchannels.
**Performance for DARP Phase 1 receiver with legacy training sequences**
For performance measurement the frame erasure rate (FER) is displayed over the
the carrier to interferer ratio (CIR). The CIR for MTS-2 scenario is related
to the dominant interferer designated as C/I~0~. In case of OSC the power of
the wanted sub channel is considered. The other orthogonal sub channel is not
taken into account in C/I calculation. Performance was compared applying
linearized GMSK pulse shape filter.
In Figure 7-15 the downlink performance of MTS-2 is evaluated against
reference for some codecs of AMR Full Rate (AFS) and AMR Half Rate (AHS) with
ideal frequency hopping.

shape was used in this evaluation as well as new TSC for the paired
subchannel. Performance is depicted for both a DARP phase 1 (GMSK RX for OSC)
and an OSC aware MS. For comparison AMR HR 5.9 needs about 7dB higher C/I than
AMR FR 5.9, thus orthogonal sub channel can improve HR performance by about 4
dB in TU3 iFH.

**Multiplexing a SAIC mobile with a legacy non-SAIC mobile**
In this section the case of multiplexing a SAIC mobile with a non-SAIC mobile
is studied. It should be noted that one of the two mobiles use the newer TSC
hence they are not entirely legacy in that sense. However, apart from the
knowledge of the new TSC, nothing else is modified for the SAIC algorithm.
Hence, the SAIC mobile with the knowledge of new TSC here might as well
represent a OSC aware mobile.
The multiplexing case studied here is the case when the SAIC mobile is on the
weaker sub-channel and the legacy non-SAIC mobile is on the stronger sub-
channel. This is the typical multiplexing use case to support legacy non-SAIC
mobiles in the field using OSC. The results are shown in Figures 7-17, 7-18,
7-19 and 7-20. It can be observed that to multiplex 4 users (2 of which are
legacy non-SAIC mobiles) using half rate codecs -- TCHHS or TCHAHS 5.9, C/Is
around 10 to 20 dB are sufficient in the cell. To multiplex full rate users
using TCHAFS 5.9 for instance C/I ratios from 3 to 15 dB are sufficient. Thus
it can be seen that multiplexing a legacy non-SAIC mobile with a SAIC mobile
using OSC is feasible using both full rate and half rate codec modes. Hence,
up to four users including legacy non-SAIC mobiles could be multiplexed using

Legend: In the figures above, the usage of rectangular and square
constellations is switched using a predetermined pattern of length 8. For
instance, Square1_Rect7_SAIC_ON depicts the performance of a SAIC mobile when
the constellation diagram is switched between 1 square (QPSK burst) and 7
rectangular bursts alternatively. It should be noted that when the rectangular
burst is used, the signal corresponding to the SAIC mobile is attenuated (by
approximately 7.6592 dB). RectConst_SAIC_ON refers to the case when all the
bursts use the depicted rectangular constellation (performance of SAIC mobile
which in this case is always on the weaker channel is depicted) and
SquareConst_SAIC_OFF referes to the case when all the bursts use QPSK
(performance of non SAIC mobile is depicted).
**Multiplexing two SAIC mobiles**
Multiplexing two SAIC mobiles is the easier case compared to the case studied
in section above. The advantage of having 2 SAIC mobiles is that multiplexing
could be achieved with much lower C/Is in the cell as seen from Figures 7-21,
7-22, 7-23 and 7-24. Here user 2 is always put on the strong channel and user
1 is put on the weaker channel. It can be seen that with 2 SAIC mobiles, C/I
ratios in the range of -3 to 12 dB are sufficient to support simultaneous
voice call between two mobiles on the downlink using TCHAFS 5.9 codec for
instance. It should again be noted that one of the two SAIC mobiles used the
orthogonal TSC from the new TSC set and hence can be considered as a OSC aware
mobile. Alternatively two TSCs from the legacy set which have good
orthogonality could also be chosen thereby multiplexing 2 legacy SAIC mobiles
simultaneously. This case however has not been investigated here.

#### 7.2.1.3 Results from: MUROS -- Performance of Legacy MS
Text in this section originates by Nokia Corporation in [7-10].
In this section, the sensitivity and interference performance of both legacy
non-DARP MS and legacy DARP MS receiving a MUROS sub channel is presented. For
interference performance verification the four MUROS Test Scenarios (MTS1-4)
described in chapter 5 are used.
##### 7.2.1.3.1 Simulation Assumptions
###### 7.2.1.3.1.1 Legacy Terminals
The legacy DARP receiver applied in this section is a DARP phase I capable
terminal. Such DARP terminals are widely present in the market. The legacy
non-DARP receiver applied in this section is also present in the market.
###### 7.2.1.3.1.2 Transmitted MUROS Signal
In this section, the DL MUROS signal is generated by QPSK symbol mapping with
π/2 rotation and linearized GMSK TX pulse shape as illustrated in Figure 7-25.
This corresponds to the OSC technique presented by NSN in [7-2].
Figure 7-25: Block diagram of MUROS TX by mapping two users on BB and
transmitted as a QPSK modulated signal
As described above legacy training sequence codes (TSC) are applied to the
first MUROS sub channel to make it fully compatible with legacy MS. For the
MUROS second sub channel, the orthogonal TSCs proposed in [7-2] are assumed.
The pair TSC 0 is chosen from the combined TSC set for the simulations. DTX is
not applied.
###### 7.2.1.3.1.3 MUROS Interference Models
The four MUROS Test Scenarios (MTS1-4) specified in this TR and Adjacent
Channel Interference (ACI) have been used for verifying the interference
performance of a legacy non-DARP and legacy DARP MS receiving a MUROS sub
channel.
For MTS modulation the GMSK and MUROS modulated interference agreed for MTS1-4
in this TR are included. For ACI both the GMSK and MUROS modulation have been
used as well. Only lower band ACI (-200 kHz) is included since the effect of
upper band ACI (+200 kHz) is similar.
In [7-11] it was shown that the performance of a legacy DARP MS receiving a
MUROS sub channel is more or less independent of the interference modulation
type as long as GMSK is not applied for the interferer modulation.
###### 7.2.1.3.1.4 Other Simulation Parameter
The performance is presented for TCH/AFS 12.2, TCH/AFS 5.9 and AHS 5.9. A
typical urban channel profile, terminal speed 3 km/h (TU3) and frequency
hopping (FH) in the 900 MHz band have been used for the DL MUROS simulations.
Typical MS impairments are included in the simulations.
##### 7.2.1.3.2 Downlink Performance Results
The results in this section cover frame erasure rate (FER) as a function of
C/I1 where C denotes the total power of the received MUROS signal (i.e.
carrying 2 sub channels) and I1 denotes the power of the strongest co-channel
interferer.
The presented performance is for the first MUROS sub channel containing the
legacy TSC0. The performance of the second MUROS sub channel is not considered
in this section, since changes are required to the MS receiver in order to
cope with the orthogonal TSCs presented in [7-2]. However, when the two MUROS
sub channels have equal power the performance of the second channel can be
assumed to be on par with the first sub channel as noted in [7-12].
First the sensitivity performance is presented in subsection 7.2.1.3.2.1, and
then the interference performance for the two synchronous scenarios MTS1+2 are
presented in subsection 7.2.1.3.2.2 and 7.2.1.3.2.3 respectively. The
performance for the two asynchronous scenarios MTS3+4 are presented in
subsection 7.2.1.3.2.4 and 7.2.1.3.2.5 respectively. Finally the ACI
performance is presented in subsection 7.2.1.3.2.6.

##### 7.2.1.3.3 Summary of results
This section presented the sensitivity and interference performance of a
legacy DARP MS and a legacy non-DARP MS receiving a MUROS sub channel. For the
interference performances both the MTS1-4 interference scenarios and ACI
scenario were used with the interferer modulation type being either: GMSK or
MUROS.
As expected it was shown that legacy DARP MS are better to cope with a MUROS
sub-channel than legacy non-DARP MS. Furthermore it can be observed that a
power balancing between the two MUROS sub-channels are desirable in order to
achieve the full benefit of MUROS.
### 7.2.2 Network Level Performance
#### 7.2.2.1 Network Configurations
In order to evaluate the system impact of OSC, network simulations for the
agreed MUROS network configurations were carried out. Studied network
configurations are shown in Table 7-15 and the used channel modes and mode
channel adaptation types in Table 7-16. Adaptation between OSC and non-OSC
channel was based both on load and quality measurements. DL receiver type was
DARP Phase 1. The employed BTS antenna type had a 65° horizontal half power
beamwidth [7-8].

Basic OSC employing the QPSK constellation in DL, as described above in this
section 7.1.2.1 above, was simulated if not otherwise stated. Adaptation
between OSC and non-OSC channel was based both on load and quality
measurements. According to the defined mix of mobiles in section 5.3 the DL
receiver type was either legacy non-DARP Phase I, legacy DARP Phase I or DARP
Phase I updated with the knowledge of the new TSC set ("OSC aware MS") as
depicted in the concept description above. Legacy non-DARP Phase I mobiles
were not assigned to an OSC subchannel, whilst both other types were assigned.
It is noted that no model for TSC degradation was incoporated, i.e. it has
been assumed that always a well suited pair of TSC's is available. Link to
system mapping based on CIR and DIR has been used. *CIR and DIR are determined
taking into account each interferer in adjacent and co-channel frequencies
where each interference value is multiplied by one protection value that
varies depending on which pulse shape is being used by the interferer, on the
receiver type and on whether the interference is received in co-channel or
adjacent channel. *

#### 7.2.4.5 Conclusion
The link-2-system mapping method presented in ‎[1] has been verified for
scenario MTS-1 and MTS-2 both for single antenna non-SAIC and single antenna
SAIC receivers. Mapping from link to system level is done by measuring the
burst-wise filtered in-band powers and calculating the resulting raw BER.
Separate verifications for both OSC sub-channels have been done. Test cases
with SCPIR have been defined for both users using two different SCPIR
settings, i.e. 0 dB and -7.7 dB and combinations of both as an example.
The deviation of L2S mapping from link simulation BER seems to be always below
1dB, typically less than 0.5 dB within the effective rage of L2S table in the
network simulator.
## 7.3 Impacts on the Mobile Station
Legacy AMR mobiles may be capable to receive sub channel 0, if π/2 rotation is
applied in downlink for QPSK. For second sub channel the MS should be able to
support new training sequences in both downlink and uplink. Indeed the
receiver may need to apply e.g. pre-filtering type of receiver to remove ISI
for orthogonality.
To improve the accuracy of channel estimation the receiver may also use both
binary training sequences of sub channels, denoted as "OSC aware RX",
resulting about 0.6 dB gain with QPSK like training sequence, see Figures 7-11
and 7-16.
For sub channel specific PC the MS needs to be coping with unequal power on
sub channels. For user diversity the MS needs to support the specified user
diversity patterns and the assisted signalling.
For support of an optimised Tx pulse shape on downlink the MS needs to signal
its capability to receive it.
## 7.4 Impacts on the BSS
### 7.4.1 BTS Transmitter
The BTS transmitter should support QPSK or QPSK as subset of higher order
modulation. Also the symbol rotation of π/2 needs to be supported by the BTS.
For sub channel specific PC the BTS needs to be able to change mapping of
users to 8PSK constellation based on power control indication.
The Tx pulse shaping filter should also facilitate spectrally wider e.g. RRC
pulse shape e.g. with 270 kHz bandwidth in order to provide optimised link and
system performance. But linearised GMSK may be applied as well assuming that
the new pulse shaping filter is optional.
### 7.4.2 BTS Receiver
The BTS is preferably equipped with 2 receive antennas and uses e.g. either
Space Time Interference Rejection Combining (STIRC) or Successive Interference
Cancellation (SIC) receiver to receive orthogonal sub channels used by
different MSs. Alternatively, the BTS receiver for two GMSK users separated by
training sequences could be based e.g. on Joint Detection (JD) of two GMSK
users with a JD receiver. A fourth option is to use two independent GMSK
receivers for each sub channel.
Indeed BSS should apply uplink power control possibly interworked with Dynamic
Channel Allocation (DCA) scheme to keep difference of received uplink signal
levels of co-assigned sub channels within e.g. ±15 dB window.
### 7.4.3 Radio Resource Management (RRM)
The RRM should balance received uplink signal levels of both sub channels
within ±15 dB range and should use e.g. current AMR FR or HR traffic channels
as a fallback when needed.
With regard to the user diversity procedure, the definition of predefined user
diversity patterns as described in the concept section 7.1.2.2.5.3 needs to be
undertaken. Thus RRC signalling is needed to indicate during channel
assignment the operated user diversity pattern. In addition the sub channel
number, the used TSC on this sub channel as well as the new channel type need
to be signalled in the channel assignment message.
#### 7.4.3.1 Power Control
Downlink power control may use conditions of the weakest link as criteria.
Total power control range for uplink balancing purpose is about 30 dB + 30dB
(30 dB range for each multiplexed MS). To make PC four times faster in uplink,
Enhanced Power Control may be used.
#### 7.4.3.2 Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA)
Dynamic channel allocation can sort different OSC voice users to e.g. 30dB
windows according to path losses and allocate those to the same resource and
balance these further with power control.
Intra Cell Handover for DCA may be triggered for a user having higher or lower
level depending on the case. For example a more sensitive user with higher
path loss can be left intact, whilst a user with higher level is signalled to
perform intra cell HO or vice versa.
#### 7.4.3.3 AMR Channel Rate and Codec Mode Adaptation
The switching between e.g. FR, HR and OSC HR, may use similar criteria as in
current FR / HR switching, but may take additionally care about sufficient
path loss window to maintain operation of SIC in uplink. AMR Codec Mode
Adaptation may rely on current parameters.
## 7.5 Impacts on Network Planning
### 7.5.1 Impacts to Abis interface
In order to support OSC, dimensioning aspects on Abis interface have to be
considered. In the following impacts on Abis allocation strategy, Abis
bandwidth consumption and Abis migration paths are considered in more detail.
#### 7.5.1.1 Impact of OSC on Abis allocation strategy
Introduction of OSC denotes in the context of Abis interface introduction of 2
new transmission modes (in addition to the existing one where 1 radio channel
corresponds to 1 Abis sub channel): OSC Full Rate (OSCFR) mode and OSC Half
Rate (OSCHR) mode.
As depicted in Figure 7-39, in OSCFR mode it is possible to transmit 2 FR
users in a single radio channel which corresponds to simultaneous occupation
of 2 Abis sub channels.

Figure 7-39: Mapping of FR and OSC FR radio channels onto 16 kbit/s Abis sub
channels
As depicted in Figure 7-40, in OSCHR mode it is possible to transmit 4 HR
users in a single radio channel which also corresponds to simultaneous
occupation of 2 Abis sub channels. Note that 2 HR users working in OSC HR mode
can also be multiplexed in time. In such case they occupy 1 Abis sub channel
(just like "non OSC" HR call).
{width="2.0729166666666665in" height="3.3743055555555554in"}
Figure 7-40: Mapping of HR and OSC HR radio channels onto 16 kbit/s Abis sub
timeslots
Which of the modes (OSCFR only, OSCHR only or both) is to be used depends on
the actual implementation.
#### 7.5.1.2 Impact of OSC on bandwidth consumption
Theoretically, if all Abis timeslots in all TRXs in the given BTS site work at
the same time in "OSC transmission mode" -- the Abis bandwidth that would need
to be available for CS traffic must be doubled in comparison to "no OSC
transmission mode". Note that Abis bandwidth reserved for signalling must also
be adjusted accordingly in such case.
However, unless a 100% penetration of OSC capable mobiles is available in the
network, it is unlikely to achieve 100% penetration of OSC channels. Thus a
suitable mix of OSC channels and legacy FR and HR channels has to be assumed
for Abis dimensioning, taking into account that the mobiles may require OSC
channel mode adaptation from OSC HR channel mode or legacy HR channel mode to
legacy FR channel mode in case of degrading radio conditions. Hence the actual
impact of OSC on the Abis interface depends on penetration of the
functionality, i.e. the percentage of radio channels working in "OSC
transmission mode". The greater the penetration of OSC channels the more Abis
resources must be reserved for CS domain.
The Abis impact will be studied further in more detail for selected scenarios
based on the agreed network configurations.
#### 7.5.1.3 Abis migration paths
Implementation of OSC extending CS capacity on radio and consequently on Abis
interface as well contributes to the steadily growing requirements concerning
bandwidth available in the transport network in particular with regard to Abis
interface. On the other hand additional transport network capacity in terms of
TDM lines leads to increase of OPEX since leased lines costs' need to be taken
into account. Thus a viable solution is to migrate the transport networks
towards packet based ones and to IP based ones as replacement of the existing
TDM-based networks. One of the possible migration strategies is the
introduction of pseudowire emulation which allows to convert the selected PCM
lines into IP packets and then to transmit their content by means of Ethernet
network. This allows to smoothly migrate from TDM-based transport to IP-based
one in pace depending on availability of reliable IP/Ethernet networks. Final
step consists in using "native" IP networks to transmit traffic produced in
the RAN. With these solutions further OPEX savings in terms of smaller
bandwidth consumtion in the transport networks are expected due to additional
traffic optimization and statistical multiplexing effects.
### 7.5.2 Impacts on Frequency Planning
OSC channels can be employed both on BCCH carrier and on TCH carrier. In case
of usage of the legacy GMSK pulse shape no straight impact on frequency
planning is observed. All proposed techniques, such as subchannel specific PC,
power balancing, usage of new TSC's and user diversity are operating
independent of used frequency hopping scheme. However as performance
investigations have shown, OSC can exhibit best performance for HW limited
scenarios and loose frequency reuses. For tighter frequency reuses further
optimizations of RRM algorithms and application of enhancement techniques need
to be executed, before the potential of capacity improvement for OSC can be
identified for these scenarios.
Since OSC operates best for loose reuse scenarios, deployment on the BCCH
carrier is a viable option. This is also true in case an optimized Tx pulse
shape as described in section 7.1.2.1.3 is employed on downlink to minimise
ISI. In case an optimized Tx pulse shape is used on the TCH layer, further
investigations are required to identify the overall performance gain taking
into account impact of the wider pulse on reception of legacy mobiles. Hence
this should be studied in the context of an optional enhancement of the OSC
feature.
## 7.6 Impacts on the Specifications

OSC is believed to have a high potential for voice capacity improvement, as
has been shown in this chapter of the TR. Investigations on OSC have confirm
the high potential for doubled voice capacity in GERAN networks depending on
the frequency reuse of the network under interest. Furthermore a solution by
applying subchannel specific power control has been created to allow for
efficient multiplexing including legacy mobiles. Further enhancements using
new user diversity have been defined to improve interference diversity for
traffic channels but also for SACCH control channels. Considering that an
urgent need for this improvement has been expressed in particular by asian
operators [7-9], it is believed that GERAN should agree to open a work item on
the introduction of orthogonal sub channels.

# 8 Adaptive symbol constellation
## 8.1 Concept Description
In the uplink the MS shall use GMSK modulation. A different training sequence
shall be assigned to each MS. The BSS shall implement a multi-user multiple-
input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) receiver in order to decode the two desired
signals.
In the downlink, a linear modulator using a rotating hybrid quaternary complex
symbol constellation is proposed. The modulation is adaptive since the signal
constellation may be time dependent. The constellation can be chosen according
to the capabilities or radio conditions of the MS's. Two sub-channels are
created from the real and imaginary parts of the baseband signal. Legacy GMSK
MS may be assigned one of the subchannels provided a legacy training sequence
is used.
A new set of training sequences with good orthogonality properties shall be
designed in order to optimize the link performance both in the uplink and the
downlink.
### 8.1.1 Symbol Constellation for the Downlink
A parameter $0 \leq \alpha \leq \sqrt{2}$ is chosen to create a quaternary
constellation as shown in Table 8-1.
Table 8-1 $\alpha$-QPSK Constellation
* * *
* * *
The constellation of Table 8-1 shall be called an $\alpha$-_QPSK
constellation._ The extreme values $\alpha$= 0 and $\alpha = \sqrt{2}$ yield
BPSK constellations, while for $\alpha$= 1 an ordinary QPSK constellation is
obtained. Figure 8-1 depicts the case$\alpha$= 0.6.
{width="3.93125in" height="3.341666666666667in"}
Figure 8-1: Example $\alpha$-QPSK constellation
As $\alpha$ changes the power in the _I_ channel is changed by
$\text{10}\text{log}_{\text{10}}(\alpha^{2})$ dB, relative to the power of the
_I_ channel when using ordinary QPSK. Similarly, the power in the _Q_ branch
is changed by $\text{10}\text{log}_{\text{10}}(2 - \alpha^{2})$ dB relative to
the power of the _Q_ branch for ordinary QPSK. The cross power ratio $\chi$,
depicted in Figure 8-2, between the _I_ and _Q_ branches is determined by
$\alpha$ as:
$\chi = \text{10}\text{log}_{\text{10}}(\frac{\alpha^{2}}{2 - \alpha^{2}})$
It is expected that legacy GMSK mobiles will be able to demodulate one of the
sub-channels, provided $\alpha$is chosen so that $\left| \chi \right|$ is
large enough. This assumption is verified in section 8.2.1.3.1 .
Note that the energy in an $\alpha$-QPSK constellation is always 1,
independent of$\alpha$.
{width="5.721527777777778in" height="3.2944444444444443in"}
Figure 8-2: Cross power ratio
### 8.1.2 $\alpha$-QPSK Modulator
The linear modulator required to create the hybrid quaternary symbol
constellation of Table 8-1 is depicted in Figure 8-3. The code bits are
modulated to binary symbols {-1,+1}. This results in two binary symbol streams
a~n~ and b~n~ that are mapped to one $\alpha$-QPSK symbol stream c~n~. The
quaternary symbol stream is rotated and passed through a linear pulse shaping
filter. Finally the signal is up-mixed to the carrier frequency and amplified.
The two users are separated by means of different training sequences. The use
of orthogonal training sequences will improve the performance. Utilizing a
pulse shaping filter that satisfies the Nyquist criterion will maintain the
orthogonality of the _I_ and _Q_ sub-channels. The legacy linearized GMSK
pulse may be used in order to comply with the legacy spectral mask.
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="1.73125in"}
Figure 8-3: $\alpha$-QPSK modulator and transmitter
### 8.1.3 Choice of Symbol Constellation
To determine symbol constellation, i.e. $\alpha$, the modulator may receive
feedback from the MS's. For example $\alpha$may depend upon the reported
RXQUAL, or upon the capabilities of the MS's, e.g. legacy/legacy
SAIC/$\alpha$-QPSK-aware. This process is illustrated in Figure 8-4, where the
box labeled $\alpha$-QPSK modulator contains the modulator described in Figure
8-3. The BSC box represents the Base Station Controller.
{width="6.033333333333333in" height="3.727777777777778in"}
Figure 8-4: Adaptive $\alpha$-QPSK modulator
The BSS decides the powers P1 and P2 required for MS1 and MS2 respectively,
depending on the reported capabilities, RXQUAL and RXLEV by each MS. The
control unit computes a combination of output power P and $\alpha$ that gives
the required combination of P1 and P2. Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA) may be
used to move users from shared radio resources to not shared radio resources
and vice versa.
An $\alpha$-QPSK-aware mobile may ignore the value of $\alpha$. However, it
can be advantageous to use it during the demodulation process. Depending on
the algorithm used at the control unit, an $\alpha$-QPSK-aware MS may not have
knowledge of the value of $\alpha$used by the modulator in the BTS. If it is
unknown then it can be estimated. In section 8.2.1.2.2 simulations are
presented to show that the estimation is feasible.
### 8.1.4 Adaptive Constellation Rotation
Since compatibility with legacy mobiles is desired, it has been proposed to
rotate the signal by $\pi 2$. However, this rotation angle is not optimum in
terms of PAR for these symbol constellations. Typical power amplifiers are
peak limited, which for a signal with high PAR requires additional power
backoff. Hence, as the PAR increases, the coverage of the BTS decreases.
To optimize PAR in the DL it is proposed to adapt the rotation angle to the
capabilities of the MS receivers. The penetration of MUROS MSs will increase
with time. Eventually two MUROS mobiles will be assigned to two orthogonal
sub-channels. In this case, there's no need to continue using the sub-optimal
rotation angle. For example, if QPSK modulation is used, then rotation by $\pi
4$will result in lower PAR and will eliminate zero crossings. The figures
below illustrate this fact. The unit circle is depicted in red and the
baseband signal in blue.
{width="4.497222222222222in" height="3.377083333333333in"}

Figure 8-6: Example baseband signal. Ordinary QPSK. $\frac{\pi}{4}$ rotation.
Linearized GMSK Tx pulse
The rotation angle shall be chosen so that PAR is minimized. If there is a
legacy mobile in at least one of the sub-channels then the BTS modulator
rotates the signal by $\frac{\pi}{2}$. However, if two $\alpha$-QPSK MUROS
mobiles are paired together on orthogonal sub-channels, the transmitting base
station can choose constellation rotation to minimize PAR. To illustrate the
concept Figure 8-7 shows the PAR as a function of alpha for $\alpha$-QPSK
constellations rotated л/2 and л/4 radians.
{width="5.738194444444445in" height="3.9340277777777777in"}
Figure 8-7: PAR as a function of alpha
When alpha equals 0.77 and 1.19 the two PAR curves intersect. To minimize the
signal PAR a base station would hence adapt its choice of rotation according
to the active alpha value:
On the receiver side, the MS performs blind detection of the rotation angle,
among a predetermined set of rotation angles. From EGPRS it is known that
blind detection of rotation is possible with negligible performance loss and
low computational complexity. This assumption is verified in section
8.2.1.2.2.2.
### 8.1.5 Frequency hopping
Since the intra-cell interference is vastly increased by the introduction of
multiple users re-using the same time slot it has been considered to increase
diversity (i.e., to ensure that a user is not continuously interfered by the
same other user). Diversity is achieved by means of frequency hopping. The
frequency hopping schemes can be applied both in the uplink and downlink.
Initial simulations in the downlink show substantial gains. The performance in
the UL is FFS.
Assume that the MAIO takes values in the set $\left{ 0,1,\ldots,N - 1
\right}$. Denote by $S_{N}$ the symmetric group on the set $\left{
0,1,\ldots,N - 1 \right}$. $S_{N}$consists of all bijective mappings from
$\left{ 0,1,\ldots,N - 1 \right}$ to $\left{ 0,1,\ldots,N - 1 \right}$. In
other words, an element $\sigma \in S_{N}$is a permutation of the set of
$N$integers $\left{ 0,1,\ldots,N - 1 \right}$. The length of the MAIO hopping
sequence is chosen to be an arbitrary positive integer $M\text{.}$ A MAIO
hopping sequence is defined by a set of $M$elements
$\sigma_{0},\ldots,\sigma_{M - 1}$ of $S_{N}$. Repetitions are allowed. That
is, it is possible to choose $\sigma_{m} = \sigma_{n}$for $m \neq n$. Given a
time specified by the counter FN, the MAIO for the $i$-th call assigned to the
second OSC sub-channel is
MAIO~FN~({width="9.652777777777778e-2in"
height="0.18055555555555555in"})={width="0.7916666666666666in"
height="0.25in"}, {width="0.8333333333333334in" height="0.19375in"}. (1)
Here $\text{mod}$denotes the arithmetic modulo operator.
Since the same hopping sequence is used for the different sub channel sets it
is guaranteed that at most two users hop onto the same frequency and timeslot
at any time instant.
First the case when available frequency hopping is re-used for MUROS.
Assume that two more mobile stations are present in the cell, M4 and M5. They
are assigned parameters as shown in Table 8-2.

Using the frequency sequence in Table 8-2 results in the frequency hopping
illustrated in Figure 8-8. It is evident that mobile stations M1 and M4
continuously use the two sub-channels of the same channel and thereby are
subject to each other's inter-sub-channel interference. Similarly, M2 and M5
continuously interfere each other. M3, on the other hand, is not subject to
any inter-sub-channel interference.
Figure 8-8: Frequency hopping, with existing OSC solution
Finally, consider the OSC solution with improved frequency hopping. Assume
there are still 5 mobile stations in the cell (on the considered timeslot
number). The same parameters are used as in Table 8-2 but users of the second
sub-channel, i.e. M4 and M5 will hop between the MAIOs.
A set of permutations giving the MAIO hopping sequences in Table 8-3 is
chosen.

The resulting frequency hopping is illustrated in Figure 8-9. It can be seen
that the interference diversity has improved. E.g., mobile station M1 is
sometimes interfered by M4, sometimes by M5 and sometimes not interfered at
all. A similar improvement is seen for M2. M3, which was never subject to
inter-sub-channel interference with the existing OSC solution, is now
sometimes interfered by M4 or M5. But the fairness has improved due to the
improved frequency hopping. Further, since the channel coding makes the
channel robust to a certain amount of interference, it is likely that the
speech quality on average has improved in the cell (assuming the network is
well dimensioned to handle the given load). No simulation results have been
provided in this document but similar gains as shown in [8-3] can be expected.

#### 8.1.5.1 Legacy support
Since the frequency hopping scheme uses already available MAIO hopping the
diversity scheme will support legacy mobiles (given that legacy mobiles can be
supported by the MUROS concept and that they are allocated to sub channel
one). Note that also legacy mobiles will be able to utilize the gain of the
frequency hopping feature, especially when having fractionally loaded TSs.
#### 8.1.5.2 Additional signaling
Both the users of the first and second sub-channel will re-use the frequency
hopping in GSM is defined in the 3GPP specification 45.002 [8-4]. However, the
second set of users will use an additional hopping sequence to hop between
MAIOs, which needs to be signaled to the mobile station.
To generate the MAIO hopping sequence, the MS must know the set of allowed
MAIOs (the MAIO Allocation, _MAIOA_). Given the MAIOA, the number of MAIOs to
hop over is known. Assuming that the permutations are predetermined and stored
in the mobile station, the MS selects the permutation corresponding to the
size of the MAIOA and an additional parameter determining which MAIO hopping
sequence to use (the parameter _I_ in the example in section 8.1.5). This is
here denoted the _MAIOHSN_.
Optionally, several permutations can be defined for each given MAIOA size.
This requires another parameter to be signaled to the mobile station, a MAIO
permutation number, MAIOPN.
The MAIOA, the MAIOHSN and optionally the MAIOPN need to be signaled to the
mobile station during assignment, handover and reconfiguration. It is
necessary to update the relevant signaling messages to convey the new
parameters.
Since the resource allocation in the cell can change during a call, it should
be possible to change the parameters during a call. Therefore, the signaling
messages should also include means for coordinating the change to new hopping
parameters between all MS, e.g., a _starting time_ after which the new
parameters apply.
### 8.1.6 SAM - Single Antenna MIMO - for VAMOS
#### 8.1.6.1 Concept description
The $\alpha$-QPSK modulated, baseband, received signal $(r_{n})$ sampled at
the symbol rate can be written in terms of an _L_ -tap complex-valued channel
$(h_{k})_{k = 0}^{L - 1}$, the user 1 binary symbols $(a_{n})_{n = 0}^{N}$,
the binary symbols for user 2, $(b_{n})_{n = 0}^{N}$, the rotation angle
$\theta$ ($\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ for backward compatibility with legacy GMSK
mobiles) and complex-valued noise plus interference $(w_{n})$:
$r_{n} = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{k = 0}^{L - 1}{h_{k}e^{(n -
k)\text{jθ}}a_{n - k} +}j\frac{\sqrt{2 - \alpha^{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{k = 0}^{L
- 1}{h_{k}e^{(n - k)\text{jθ}}b_{n - k} + w_{n}}$. (1)
Equivalently, after de-rotation by $\theta$,
$r_{n}^{'} = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{k = 0}^{L - 1}{h_{k}^{'}a_{n - k}
+}j\frac{\sqrt{2 - \alpha^{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{k = 0}^{L - 1}{h_{k}^{'}b_{n -
k} + w_{n}^{'}}$, (2)
where the prime indicates that the signal and the channel taps have been de-
rotated.
Taking real and imaginary parts in Equation (2), and using the fact that the
symbols $(a_{n})_{n = 0}^{N}$ and $(b_{n})_{n = 0}^{N}$ are real-valued, we
obtain the following pair of equations
$\begin{matrix} \Re e(r_{n}^{'}) = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{k = 0}^{L -
1}{\Re e(h_{k}^{'})a_{n - k} -}\frac{\sqrt{2 - \alpha^{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{k =
0}^{L - 1}{\Im m(h_{k}^{'})b_{n - k} + \Re e(w_{n}^{'}),} \ \Im m(r_{n}^{'}) =
\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{k = 0}^{L - 1}{\Im m(h_{k}^{'})a_{n - k}
+}\frac{\sqrt{2 - \alpha^{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{k = 0}^{L - 1}{\Re
e(h_{k}^{'})b_{n - k} + \Im m(w_{n}^{'})}\text{.} \ \end{matrix}$ (3)
Defining
${\overrightarrow{r}}_{n} = \begin{bmatrix} \Re e(r_{n}^{'}) \ \Im
m(r_{n}^{'}) \ \end{bmatrix}$, $H_{k} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\Re e(h_{k}^{'}) & \- \frac{\sqrt{2 -
\alpha^{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}\Im m(h_{k}^{'}) \ \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\Im
m(h_{k}^{'}) & \frac{\sqrt{2 - \alpha^{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}\Re e(h_{k}^{'}) \
\end{bmatrix}$, $w_{n} = \begin{bmatrix} \Re e(w_{n}^{'}) \ \Im m(w_{n}^{'}) \
\end{bmatrix}$,
we can re-write (3) in matrix form
${\overrightarrow{r}}_{n} = \sum_{k = 0}^{L - 1}{H_{k}\begin{bmatrix} a_{n -
k} \ b_{n - k} \ \end{bmatrix} + w_{n}}$.(4)
For the sake of concreteness, let us describe a simple example of interference
cancellation based on the model (4). It employs Interference Rejection
Combining (IRC). Let $Q = E\left\lbrack w_{n} \cdot w_{n^{T}} \right\rbrack$
be the 2x2 spatial covariance matrix of the noise. First, a Cholesky
factorization $Q^{- 1} = D^{T}D$ is performed. Decorrelation of the 2 branches
in (4) is achieved by multiplying both sides of (4) by $D$.
$D \cdot {\overrightarrow{r}}_{n} = \sum_{k = 0}^{L - 1}{D \cdot
H_{k}\begin{bmatrix} a_{n - k} \ b_{n - k} \ \end{bmatrix} + D \cdot
w_{n}}$.(5)
This simple linear transformation performs interference suppression. Writing
$y_{n} = D \cdot {\overrightarrow{r}}_{n}$, $G_{k} = D \cdot H_{k}$, $e_{n} =
D \cdot w_{n}$ (5) becomes
$y_{n} = \sum_{k = 0}^{L - 1}{G_{k}\begin{bmatrix} a_{n - k} \ b_{n - k} \
\end{bmatrix} + e_{n}}$, (6)
where ($e_{n}$) is a two dimensional white noise and
$= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{d_{\text{11}}\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\Re e(h_{k}^{'}) +
\frac{d_{\text{12}}\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\Im m(h_{k}^{'}) & \-
\frac{d_{\text{11}}\sqrt{2 - \alpha^{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}\Im m(h_{k}^{'}) +
\frac{d_{\text{12}}\sqrt{2 - \alpha^{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}\Re e(h_{k}^{'}) \
\frac{d_{\text{22}}\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}\Im m(h_{k}^{'}) &
\frac{d_{\text{22}}\sqrt{2 - \alpha^{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}\Re e(h_{k}^{'}) \
\end{bmatrix}$.
Note that the matrix taps $G_{k}$ of the whitened channel do not exhibit the
symmetries of the original channel taps $H_{k}$.
The signal model
$y_{n} = \sum_{k = 0}^{L - 1}{\begin{bmatrix} g_{\text{11}}^{k} &
g_{\text{12}}^{k} \ g_{\text{21}}^{k} & g_{\text{22}}^{k} \
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} a_{n - k} \ b_{n - k} \ \end{bmatrix} + e_{n}}$
(7)
is a time dispersive 2x2 MIMO system with additive Gaussian white noise.
Optimum detectors are known for these signals. Hence, this type of receiver is
appropriately named Single Antenna MIMO (SAM) receiver.
Please note that we do not advocate the simple IRC technique of (5). It is
included just to illustrate the main idea. Better performance is obtained if
more sophisticated whitening techniques are used. For example, the SAM
receiver used for the simulations in Section 4 models the noise plus
interference $(w_{n})$in (4) as a Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) process 0.
Note that if there is no interference present then (4) reduces to a model for
joint detection, which yields the optimum receiver in sensitivity scenarios.
Thus, the signal model (4) provides an accurate representation of
$\alpha$-QPSK modulated signals in both interference and sensitivity
scenarios.
##### 8.1.6.1.1 Computational Complexity
The computational complexity of a SAM receiver depends upon subtle
implementation details. However, it is possible to make several general
observations.
  * The number of state transitions required in the trellis in a SAM demodulator with $L$ MLSE taps is $4^{L}$. Thus, if 3 MLSE taps are used, the number of state transitions will be $4^{3} = \text{64}$. As a comparison, a typical legacy GMSK demodulator uses 5 MLSE taps and there are $2^{5} = \text{32}$transitions in the trellis, and in an 8PSK demodulator with 2 MLSE taps there are $8^{2} = \text{64}$transitions in the trellis.
  * Synchronization and estimation (e.g. channel estimation) for SAM are slightly more complex than in legacy SAIC receivers.
  * Several well known interference suppression algorithms used in legacy DARP Phase I receivers may be re-used in SAM receivers.
Taking into account the previous observations, a rough estimate of the
complexity of SAM can be made:
Complexity SAM with 3 MLSE taps $2\text{.}5 \times$Complexity legacy GMSK
SAIC.
## 8.2 Performance Characterization
### 8.2.1 Link Level Performance
Link level simulations have been performed in propagation conditions TU3iFH,
TU50iFH and TU3nFH using speech codecs AFS/12.20, AFS/5.90 and AHS/5.90.
Interference simulations as well as sensitivity simulations have been
performed for the both DL and UL. Interference scenarios MTS-1-4 has been used
for the evaluation.
Sub channel power imbalance ratios, SCPIRs, of -8, -4, 0, 4, 8 dB has been
investigated for the DL and SCPIRs of 0,-5,-10,-15 have been investigated for
the UL.
#### 8.2.1.1 Simulation assumptions
In the DL simulations, three different receiver types have been used: non-SAIC
receiver, SAIC receiver and MUROS receiver. For the UL a Successive
Interference Cancellation, SIC, receiver has been used.
For the sensitivity limited scenarios in DL a backoff of 3.3 dB has been used,
based on Figuer 8-7. It should be noted that a smaller backoff could be used
for alpha values ≠ 1.
Common simulations assumptions for UL and DL are listed in Table 8-5 and
assumptions specific for DL and UL are listed in Table 8-6 and Table 8-7
respectively.

For the UL the wanted sub-channel is denoted C1, while the paired sub-channel
is denoted C2. The two columns in the UL plots show the results of the same
simulations. The difference is in the scale of horizontal axis. The total
carrier to interference ratio (C/I, where C=C1+C2) is shown on the left hand
side, while the sub-carrier to interference ratio C1/I is depicted on the
right hand side.
NOTE: The agreed working assumption is to present plots for (C1+C2)/I.
NOTE: The performance for the UL has been normalized so that the reference
receiver reaches 1% FER @ 0 dB.
#### 8.2.1.2 Sensitivity Performance
##### 8.2.1.2.1 SAIC receiver
From the simulations below it can be concluded that:
  * The SAIC receiver can handle sub channel power imbalance ratios, SCPIRs, ≥ -8 dB.
  * The higher the SCPIR, the closer the performance is to a legacy GMSK channel.
  * The lower the SCPIR the larger degradation. I.e. the degradation from SCPIR=-4 -> SCPIR=-8 is larger than the degradation from SCPIR=0 -> SCPIR = -4.

###### 8.2.1.2.1.1 Support of legacy mobiles
One important objective of the feasibility study is to enable support of
legacy mobiles with the new technique. Simulations have been performed by a
number of vendors, see [8-5]-[8-9], to investigate the feasibility of using
the adaptive symbol constellation concept with legacy SAIC implementations.
The simulation results are collected in the following sections. A more
detailed description of these findings can be found in [8-10].
It is shown that most SAIC implementations investigated seem to be able to
support the concept.
All five references simulated α-QPSK in sensitivity limited scenarios with
different speech codecs. AFS12.2 and AFS5.90 was common to all vendors and has
thus been used in the comparison.
The different performance has been compared to SCPIR = 0 dB at 10 % FER.
Although 1 % FER would be a more suitable measure for speech performance, 10 %
has been chosen since more results are available at this level.
In all simulations a TU3iFH channel has been used.
NOTE: The performance shown estimates the performance presented in
[8-5]-[8-9].
Based on [8-5]-[8-9] the SNR performance has been estimated at 10 % FER.

In general it can be seen in Figure 8-12a that most legacy SAIC
implementations are aligned in performance (Ericsson, Nokia and NXP) with one
implementation giving a larger degradation (ZTE). One SAIC implementation
performs significantly different (Marvell), experiencing a FER collapse at
SCPIR \ SCPIR=-8 is larger than the degradation from SCPIR=0 -> SCPIR = -4.

###### 8.2.1.3.2.1 Adaptive Constellation Rotation
Altering alpha or switching the rotation of the $\alpha$-QPSK MUROS
constellation between л/2 and л/4 could deteriorate SAIC mobiles' ability to
cancel interference caused by MUROS signals. To investigate this, simulations
were conducted for both GMSK and α-QPSK modulated carriers exposed to
$\alpha$-QPSK modulated interference with varying alpha and a rotation of л/2
or л/4 as can be seen in the figure below.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="1.5493055555555555in"}
Figure 8-41: Identified interference scenarios
For the α-QPSK modulated carriers the alpha values were chosen according to
Table 8-10. The same α-value was used by the carrier and interfering signal.
The alpha values and constellation rotations used were chosen from Figure 8-9.
Alpha equal to 0.77 and 1.19 represents the extreme values where the rotation
switches from п/2 to п/4. As alpha approaches these values the $\alpha$-QPSK
modulation approaches a GMSK constellation.
Figure 8-42 presents the results from the simulation when the carrier was
α-QPSK modulated and the interferer either GMSK or α-QPSK modulated. The
α-QPSK interferers were rotated л/2 or л/4 while the carrier used a rotation
of л/2. The performance degradation due to the change in rotation reaches its
maximal value 0.2 dB when α equals 0.77.

GMSK carrier is exposed to MTS-1 or MTS-2 interference. The interferers are
α-QPSK modulated, and the performance is shown for alpha in the range 0.77 to
1.19, which corresponds to a SCPIR of -3.8 to +3.8dB. For each alpha the
symbol rotation of the interferers is л/2 or л/4.

Figure 8-43: SAIC performance for a GMSK carrier when exposed to MTS-1 (left)
and MTS-2 (right) interference, where the interferers are alpha-QPSK
modulated. Each tick on the x-axis equals 0.2dB
By comparing the performance at the different rotations, it is possible to
estimate the performance degradation in dB of the SAIC receiver at 1% FER.
Figure 8-44 summarizes this degradation over the studied alpha range. The fine
resolution on the y-axis is justified since 150 000 frames per point were
simulated. The degradation worsens as alpha approaches the theoretical
rotation adaptation thresholds of 0.77 and 1.19. For MTS-1 the maximal
degradation equals 0.37dB while 0.09 dB for MTS-2.
It can be seen that when the MS experiences a multiple interferer scenario,
the degradation due to the modulation rotation is decreased significantly
compared to the single interferer case. It should be noted that the MTS-2
multi-interferer case is seen as the relevant system scenario for MUROS.
Figure 8-44 shows, for both scenarios, that symbol rotation л/4 is preferred
when alpha is close to 1. The reason is that when the interferer modulation
constellation is QPSK-like the SAIC receiver has limited, or no, capability to
suppress the interference, as can also be seen in [8-12] and [8-13], since the
two sub channels are always 90 degree phase shifted. On the other hand, л/4
rotation is used in the transmitter and л/2 de-rotation is used in the
receiver, resulting in a net rotation of -л/4 for the interference. This type
of interference causes less performance degradation in the receiver than a
BPSK signal rotated л/2. This resembles the case in EGPRS where it is observed
that 8PSK interference is less harmful than GMSK interference for a non-SAIC
receiver.

##### 8.2.1.3.3 MUROS receiver
###### 8.2.1.3.3.1 Constellation Rotation Detection
When an additional rotation is introduced for the α-QPSK modulation, the MS
needs to detect it blindly, as mentioned in section 8.1.4. While MUROS
receiver performance in sensitivity limited scenario is presented in section
8.2.1.2.2.2, Figure 8-45 depicts the performance degradation of the same
receiver when the α-QPSK carrier is exposed to GMSK modulated MTS-2
interference.
The performance is shown for codecs TCH/HS, TCH/AHS5.9 and TCH/AFS12.2 when
the alpha-QPSK modulation constellation is determined by alpha 0.634, 1 and
1.264. The degradation at 1% FER is at most 0.15 dB at SCPIR=+6 dB compared to
performance when no modulation needs to be detected. At SCPIR=0 dB and
SCPIR=-6 dB no degradation is seen.
As the degradation due rotation detection never exceeds 0.15dB for any of the
studied alpha values it will be compensated by the PAR enhancement presented
in Figure 8-7.

It should be noted that the MUROS receiver estimates the rotation on a burst-
by-burst basis. If the blind rotation detection metric were to be accumulated
over several bursts, the performance is expected to be improved.

###### # 8.2.1.3.4.1.2 Performance Plots for MTS Test Scenarios
The performance has been normalized so that the reference receiver reaches 1%
FER @ 0 dB.
From the simulations shown below it can be concluded:
  * The performance in the MTS-2 (synchronous, multiple interferers) and MTS-4 (asynchronous, multiple interferers) test cases is very similar, for both reference and SIC receivers.
  * In most test cases the performance of the weakest sub-channel is inferior to the performance of the reference MRC receiver at 1% FER. Since a legacy IRC receiver exhibits much better performance than an MRC receiver in interference scenarios, the degradation with respect to a legacy IRC receiver can be very large, roughly from 6 to 20 dB, depending on the IRC algorithms and the test case.

###### 8.2.1.3.4.2 Investigations by ST-NXP Wireless France
Text in this section is based on contributions [8-20] and [8-21].
###### # 8.2.1.3.4.2.1 Introduction
Successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers have been proposed for
the OSC/MUROS uplink, which can be understood as a 2x2 MIMO scheme with 2
users transmitting on separate antennas [8-15]. To take benefit from dual
receive antennas available in a typical BTS, SIC can be combined with
diversity interference cancellation techniques for MUROS uplink receiver
implementations [8-20]. This receiver is considered as a good trade off
between complexity and performance, especially when combined with diversity
interference cancellation techniques, which can also be denoted as
interference rejection combining (IRC) [8-22].
Contrastingly, the MUROS downlink signal is typically sent from a single BTS
antenna to both users and received by a single receive antenna in each MS.
This situation is expected to persist in the future, at least for the vast
majority of phones used by billions of worldwide GSM subscribers. As a result,
the downlink is supposed to remain the limiting factor in network planning
also with MUROS, even though the signals for both users are transmitted
orthogonally to facilitate their separation.
For the MUROS downlink, single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) as
defined by DARP phase 1 capability is already performing quite well to
demodulate the MUROS sub channel based on a legacy training sequence [8-28].
For MUROS specification, the VAMOS work item [8-18] approved at GERAN #40
foresees the definition of two different levels of VAMOS support in new MS.
While a first class requires only support of new training sequences in
addition to DARP phase 1 capability using SAIC, a second class shall provide
more advanced receiver performance specifically for the MUROS/VAMOS downlink
signal.
In this section,
  * the link performance of a SIC receiver for the uplink is evaluated. Simulations for the AFS 5.9 and AHS 5.9 have been performed for MUROS test scenarios MTS 1 and MTS-2. Simulation assumptions and results have been updated compared to an earlier version presented at MUROS telco #9.
  * the link performance of a SIC receiver for the downlink is evaluated, in that the ST-NXP solution of SAIC called mono interference cancellation (MIC) technology is combined with SIC techniques to achieve advanced VAMOS downlink receiver performance (S-MIC). This combination is advantageous especially for downlink power control by adaptive signal constellation, which is foreseen for VAMOS specification. Additionally S-MIC shows significant performance improvements in the case of sensitivity. Both classes of VAMOS capable terminals (MIC and S-MIC) have been simulated for MTS-1, MTS-2 and sensitivity scenarios based on AFS 12.2, AFS 5.9, AHS 7.95 and AHS 5.9 channels.
###### # 8.2.1.3.4.2.2 Simulation Assumptions for Uplink
For BTS receive diversity, methods like enhanced diversity interference
cancellation can be applied, which have been developed for GMSK modulation,
first shown in [8-23]. These methods have been reused for MSRD receivers
[8-24]. For MUROS uplink receivers, better radio and baseband conditions at
the BTS and specific characteristics of MUROS system definition allow
combination with further methods. Good decorrelation of BTS antennas, aligned
timing synchronization between the subchannels by timing advance and knowledge
of the training sequence of both subchannels can be assumed. This allows
exceptionally good performance already in combination with successive
interference cancellation, which is still less complex than joint detection.
The total complexity of the SIC algorithm considered here (fixed point MIPS)
is only about 3 times higher for both users than a conventional diversity IC
receiver for a single user.
Simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of a SIC receiver
in combination with IRC. For reference purpose a conventional GMSK MRC
receiver is included in the analysis. The simulation assumptions are very
similar to [8-22] and summarized in Table 8-11b.

###### # 8.2.1.3.4.2.3 Simulation Results for Uplink
It is preferred to plot absolute FER performance results. These plots, which
are all positioned on the left hand side in the following pairs of plots in
this subsection below, allow comparison with other UL simulations, which have
already started to show absolute performance [8-25].
The performance plots on the right hand side are based on the same
simulations, but have been normalized so that the MRC performance becomes 1%
FER @ 0 dB, similar to [8-22], [8-26]. The conventional MRC receiver can be
expected to provide a better reference basis for comparing simulations results
between companies than the IRC receiver, because IRC results are supposed to
dependent more strongly on the specific implementation. Therefore comparison
with [8-26] would be quite difficult in any case and IRC results are not
provided here.
In Figures 53 (a and b) to 54 (a and b) below additional results for varying
frequency offset between the subchannels are shown. These can be compared with
results in [8-27], but don't show any strong dependency on the frequency
offset between the MUROS subchannels reported in that earlier contribution.
In general the uplink performance at 1% FER for interference turns out to be
consistently better than MRC, with only few exceptions if the difference
between C1 and C2 is 10 dB or more.

###### # 8.2.1.3.4.2.5 Simulation Results for Downlink
FER performance results are shown versus two different carrier-to-interference
ratio definitions. Either the wanted sub channel power C1 or the total carrier
power C = C1 + C2 of the MUROS downlink signal is considered as the carrier
power. In both cases, the interference is defined as the dominating interferer
power I1 (in case of MTS-1 this is the total external interference power I =
I1, while the other external interferer contributions of the MTS-2 model
increase I according to I / I1 = 0.6 dB [8-29]).
  * The plots FER versus C1/I1, which are all positioned on the left hand side in the following pairs of plots, in fact disregard the internal interference power by the second sub channel C2 [8-30].
  * The performance plots on the right hand side are based on the same simulations, but are depicted FER versus C/I1, and show the fraction C2 of carrier power C, which does not contribute to the wanted signal for user 1, as an additional degradation [8-28].
Also sensitivity results are shown versus two different signal-to-noise ratio
definitions. Either the wanted symbol energy Eb of sub channel C1 or the total
symbol energy Es of the total carrier power C = C1 + C2 is considered [8-31].
For reference purpose, the performance of a conventional equalizer for legacy
GMSK case C = C1 is shown in both plots. Furthermore, the reference
performance requirements from TS 45.005 for non-DARP capable MS are marked (in
case of MTS-2 the reference interference level is increased by 0.6 dB on the
C1/I1, resp. C/I1 scale).
Comparison between results for MTS-1 and MTS-2 interference scenarios does not
show really strong dependency of the receiver performance on the interference
type. Also the impact of interferer modulation type is expected to be rather
limited based on previous analyses for MIC [8-28].

###### # 8.2.1.3.4.2.6 Conclusions
The simulation results for uplink presented have been all achieved in fixed
point implementation with reasonable complexity, which could also be scaled up
or down especially regarding the SIC component. Taking MRC without MUROS as a
reference, it becomes evident that the MUROS link performance that can be
achieved by efficient combination of advanced receiver techniques is in the
same order of magnitude or even better. Since MRC uplink performance is often
considered as basis for network planning, this observation supports
feasibility of MUROS to provide sufficient uplink performance in these
networks even for half rate channels.
The simulation results turn out to be extremely robust with respect to
frequency offset, which may be quite high under practical network operation
conditions with all variety of MS types. The conclusions presented here for
uplink complement similar conclusions from downlink results about the
tremendous benefit from MUROS for upgrading existing networks, which has
already been shown before [8-28].
The simulation results for downlink show that for a first level of VAMOS
capability the MIC / SAIC receiver performs quite well. When compared based on
wanted signal power C1, some degradation occurs for the weaker sub channel.
With an advanced successive MIC receiver (S-MIC), this degradation of the
weaker sub channel can mostly be avoided, and also the baseline performance
for equally strong sub channels can be improved. The performance improvement
is observed consistently for the interference scenarios MTS-1, MTS-2 and also
for sensitivity. In summary, S‑MIC provides well advanced receiver performance
for a second level of VAMOS capability. The results presented herein have been
all achieved in fixed point implementation with reasonable complexity. The
S-MIC complexity is about 2.5 times higher than for MIC and could also be
scaled up or down especially regarding the SIC component. The complexity is
supposed affordable in a typical modern MS by SW implementation. Therefore the
second level of VAMOS capable MS as defined in the WID is deemed feasible.
Taking into account the total carrier power C = C1 + C2 of the MUROS signal,
the downlink power is shared by 2 users and especially the performance of the
weaker sub channel C1 degrades in a natural way when reducing C1/C2. However,
especially with the advanced successive MIC (S‑MIC) receiver, the degradation
is basically limited to this natural degradation by reduction of downlink
transmit power. For equal power of C1 and C2, only 3 dB are unavoidably lost
by power splitting and the interference performance for MUROS signals is not
far from the original reference interference performance of the GSM system
before introduction of SAIC. This comparison shows the tremendous benefit from
MUROS for upgrading existing networks, as already been shown before [8-28].
Further improvements have been achieved by SIC methods in the downlink and fit
very well with downlink power control by adaptive signal constellation [8-21].
##### 8.2.1.3.5 SAM Receiver for VAMOS
A SAM receiver prototype based upon the signal model (4) described in section
8.1.6 has been developed. The intention of the present contribution is to
provide a proof of concept for SAM. The receiver has not been optimized or
tuned. It is only a preliminary version. On the other hand, the reference is
an optimized, commercially available, DARP Phase I receiver.
###### 8.2.1.3.5.1 Simulation assumptions
The wanted sub-channel is denoted C1, while the paired sub-channel is denoted
C2. The carrier to interference ratio C/I, where C=C1+C2, is used in the
plots. In multiple interference scenarios the dominant interferer is denoted
I1 and the carrier to dominant interferer C/I1 is plotted. 10000 frames are
used for each point in the graphs.
The simulation assumptions are shown in Table 8-11d below.

Figure 8-60j - Performance of SAM and SAIC in MTS-2, AHS5.90 with QPSK
modulated interference
It can be seen that SAM yields substantial performance gains against a DARP
Phase I receiver, in both MTS-1 and MTS-2 interference scenarios, and for
SCPIR in the range from 0 down to -20 dB. For example, the performance of SAM
with SCPIR = -16 dB is comparable to the performance of legacy SAIC with SCPIR
= -8 dB. Thus SAM can cope with much larger power imbalance ratios than legacy
SAIC receivers. This is an advantage, especially if legacy non-SAIC mobiles
are assigned to the paired sub-channel. It has also been shown that SAM is
robust and offers protection against QPSK interference. The degradation
compared to GMSK interference has been shown to be less than 0.5 dB for multi-
interferer scenarios (MTS-2) while larger degradations are seen when
experiencing a single interferer (MTS-1).
The large gains for the weakest subchannel obtained for SCPIR of the order of
-8 dB or lower are noteworthy. Advanced VAMOS receivers, and in particular
SAM, may be the key to obtain significant capacity increases when non-SAIC
legacy mobiles are allowed in one of the VAMOS sub-channels. System
simulations with SAM mobiles are for further study.
##### 8.2.1.4 Results from: MUROS - Performance of Alpha-QPSK with Legacy DARP
MS
Text in this section originates by Nokia Corporation in [8-14].
The text in this section has been contributed by Nokia in [8-14]. This section
presents the sensitivity and interference performance of legacy DARP MS
receiving an alpha-QPSK [8-16] MUROS sub channel. For interference performance
verification the four MUROS Test Scenarios (MTS1-4) described in chapter 5 in
this TR are used.
##### 8.2.1.4.1 Simulation Assumptions
###### 8.2.1.4.1.1 Legacy Terminals
The legacy DARP receiver applied in this section is a DARP phase I capable
terminal. Such DARP terminals are widely present in the market.
###### 8.2.1.4.1.2 Transmitted MUROS Signal
In this section, the desired DL MUROS signal is generated by alpha-QPSK symbol
mapping with π/2 rotation and linearized GMSK TX pulse shape as illustrated in
Figure 8-61. The receiver is a legacy DARP receiver, i.e. the received signal
is being treated as a GMSK modulated signal.
Figure 8-61: Block diagram of MUROS α-QPSK TX by mapping two users on BB and
transmitted as a QPSK modulated signal
As described above in this TR, legacy training sequence codes (TSC) are
applied to the first MUROS sub channel to make it fully compatible with legacy
MS. For the MUROS second sub channel, the orthogonal TSCs proposed in [8-15]
are assumed. The pair TSC 0 is chosen from the combined TSC set for the
simulations. DTX is not applied.
###### 8.2.1.4.1.3 Alpha-QPSK
The α-value can take any value between 0 and $\sqrt{2}$ and reflects the power
ratio between the two users, where the outer values corresponds to BPSK for
either user 1 or user 2 (i. e. only one user transmitted), and α = 1
correspond to equal power between the two. The constellation points for
different α-values are shown in Figure 8-62. The red circle (O) correspond to
α = 1.0 (which equals OSC presented in [8-15]), and the blue cross (X)
corresponds to α = 0.2. Only performance of user 1 is evaluated and from user
1 point-of-view α > 1.0 will only improve performance over OSC, therefore only
α ≤ 1.0 is simulated to see the performance loss of different α-values.

###### 8.2.1.4.1.4 MUROS Interference Models
Sensitivity and the four MUROS Test Scenarios (MTS1-4) specified in this TR
have been used for verifying the interference performance of a legacy DARP MS
receiving a MUROS sub channel.
For MTS modulation QPSK modulated interference were used.
###### 8.2.1.4.1.5 Other Simulation Parameters
The performance is presented for TCH/AFS 12.2, TCH/AFS 5.9 and AHS 5.9. A
typical urban channel profile, terminal speed 3 km/h (TU3) and frequency
hopping (FH) in the 900 MHz band have been used for the DL MUROS simulations.
Typical MS impairments are included in the simulations.
##### 8.2.1.4.2 Downlink Performance Results
The results in this section cover frame erasure rate (FER) as a function of
C/I1 where C denotes the total power of the received MUROS signal (i.e.
carrying 2 sub channels) and I1 denotes the power of the strongest co-channel
interferer.
The presented performance is for the first MUROS sub channel containing the
legacy TSC0. The performance of the second MUROS sub channel is not considered
in this section, since changes are required to the MS receiver in order to
cope with the MUROS TSC-pairs. The TSC0-pair proposed in [8-15] is used for
the second MUROS sub channel. However, when the two alpha-QPSK MUROS sub
channels have equal power (correspond to α = 1.0) the performance of the
second channel can be assumed to be on par with the first sub channel as noted
in [8-17].
First the sensitivity performance is presented in subsection 8.2.1.4.2.1, and
then the interference performance for the two synchronous scenarios MTS1+2 are
presented in subsection 8.2.1.4.2.2 and 8.2.1.4.2.3 respectively. The
performance for the two asynchronous scenarios MTS3+4 are presented in
subsection 8.2.1.4.2.4 and 8.2.1.4.2.5 respectively.

##### 8.2.1.4.3 Summary of Results
This section has presented the sensitivity and interference performance of a
legacy DARP MS receiving an alpha-QPSK MUROS sub channel. For the interference
performances the MTS1-4 interference scenarios were used with the interferer
modulation type being QPSK.
### 8.2.2 Network Level Performance
#### 8.2.2.1 Adaptive constellation rotation
System simulations have been performed to estimate the possible network gains
by the introduction of adaptive symbol constellation rotation.
The investigated scenario is for 100 % MUROS MS penetration.
It should be noted that the adaptive constellation rotation will also give
coverage gains in sensitivity limited scenarios, but this has not been
evaluated in this investigation.
The investigated scenario is MUROS-2 where a backoff of 3.3 dB and 2.6 dB has
been investigated.
The impact on different QPSK backoff is investigated and Figure 8-68 shows the
spectral efficiency at the non-MUROS reference case, at 3.3 dB QPSK power
backoff and at 2.6 dB QPSK power backoff.
{width="5.83125in" height="3.140972222222222in"}
Figure 8-68: Spectral efficiency MUROS-2
The gains for test case A and B are presented in Table 8-12. No values are
presented for test case C (AFS 5.9) since this case is block limited and will
not give any gain. Case D is still left TBD.
Table 8-12: Capacity gain using different QPSK

dB** A 82% (*) 95% (*) B 75% 80% C Block limited -
* * *
> * Gain presented at 96% satisfied users
It can be seen that there are gains of approximately 5 - 13 %-units in
spectral efficiency by using 2.6 dB backoff compared to the case of using a
3.3 dB backoff.
NOTE 1: The degradation due to the blind modulation detection evaluated in
section 8.2.1.3.3.1 has been shown to be 0 dB at α=1.
NOTE 2: No sub channel power control has been used in the system simulations.
#### 8.2.2.2 Support of legacy non-DARP Phase I receivers using α-QPSK
With the right SCPIR between two sub-channels it is possible to support legacy
non-SAIC terminals on VAMOS timeslots. See [8-36] for additional information.
Table 8-13a show the spectral and hardware efficiency results for MUROS-2 with
50% VAMOS penetration level (giving 35% legacy non-SAIC and 15% legacy SAIC
penetration levels) and speech codec AHS 5.9. D0 is the non-VAMOS reference
scenario while the D1 scenario utilizes OSC with legacy non-SAIC capable
terminals not allowed on VAMOS TS. Note that with this restriction, α-QPSK
cannot provide better spectral efficiency than OSC since the network is block
limited due to lack of resources.

Note: "non-SAIC" in the table text refer to legacy non-SAIC capable terminals
Table 8-13b shows the gains for MUROS-2 with 50% VAMOS penetration level
(giving 35% legacy non-SAIC penetration level) and speech codec AHS 5.9. The
results are compared with the non-VAMOS reference.

* The quality requirement of all non-SAIC MSs allocated on VAMOS timeslots is not fulfilled
It has also been shown that α-QPSK can be used to support legacy non-SAIC
terminals to be VAMOS allocated. When this is allowed in the system
simulation, the gain increases from 49% to 70% using VAMOS I and from 49% to
76% using VAMOS II terminals.
The following should be noted regarding the results:
  * The system is only evaluated on DL. The results are only valid for ideal UL.
  * The VAMOS terminals that have been used in the simulations are either SAIC or SAM capable.
  * The SAM receiver prototype used in these simulations has not been optimized or tuned (see section 4 in [5]).
  * Only MUROS-2 for speech codec AHS 5.9 has been evaluated. Other speech codecs and MUROS-3 is left for FFS.
#### 8.2.2.2a Downlink power control using α-QPSK
A summary of system performance results for basic OSC and α-QPSK (using VAMOS
type I and type II receivers) are presented in Table 8-13c, 8-13d and 8-13e.
100% VAMOS penetration have been compared with 100% SAIC penetration. For
details in simulation assumptions, system modelling and absolute
capacityfigurse, see [8-35]

It is shown that the α-QPSK candidate technique give large capacity gains in
networks using sparse frequency reuse, like MUROS-2. The gains for the AHS
5.90 codec for MUROS-2 are about 8 percentage points using VAMOS I terminals
and 19 percentage points using VAMOS II terminals at 100% VAMOS penetration,
compared to the basic OSC reference case.
##### 8.2.2.2.1 SCPIR distributions in different system simulations
Figure 8-69 shows the SCPIR distributions that are used in the system when the
system reaches the quality limit. The left diagram shows the SCPIR
distributions for a simulation with non-SAIC, SAIC and VAMOS type I receivers
and the right diagram for a simulation with non-SAIC, SAIC and VAMOS type II
receivers. It can be seen that the VAMOS type II (SAM) receiver can utilize
the discrete alpha values more efficiently, thus providing better support for
legacy non-SAIC terminals. The discrete alpha values used in the simulations
are described in [8-21].

#### 8.2.2.3 Evaluation of VAMOS MAIO hopping
This section presents system performance results for the VAMOS specific MAIO
hopping schemes. See [8-23] for additional information.
Table 8-14 shows the gain for simulation scenario MUROS-3A and MUROS-3B with
and without MAIO hopping. The receiver type is based on SAM and positive
effects from MAIO hopping can be observed for both OSC and α-QPSK.

Table 8-15 shows spectral efficiency and 8-16 shows hardware efficiency. The
non-VAMOS reference spectral efficiency is 26.25 Erl/MHz/Site (blocking
limited) for both MUROS-3A and MUROS-3B. All simulations results presented in

The suggested MAIO hopping technique provide positive gains in high
interference system scenarios for the full rate codec AFS 5.90.
The system level gain for the candidate technique OSC goes from 54% to 73% in
a 1/3 frequency reuse (MUROS-3A) and from 46% to 56% in a 1/1 frequency reuse
(MUROS-3B) compared to the non-VAMOS reference, C0.
For the candidate technique α-QPSK, the system level gain goes from 69% to 81%
in a 1/3 frequency reuse and from 68% to 79% in a 1/1 frequency reuse compared
with the non-VAMOS reference, C0.
The following should be noted regarding the results:
  * The SAM receiver prototype used in these simulations has not been optimized or tuned
  * The impact of MAIO hopping on other half rate speech codecs, such as AHS 5.90, is left FFS.
  * The system is only evaluated on DL and the results are only valid for ideal UL. The UL might turn out to be the limiting link with improved DL receiver algorithms and is left FFS.
  * System performance results for system scenario MUROS-2 is not included in this contribution since it has already been shown to be block limited for AFS 5.90.
### 8.2.3 Verification of Link to System Mapping
This section depicts verification results for the employed Link to System
mapping for this candidate technique as agreed at GERAN#41.
#### 8.2.3.1 Methodology, DL
To derive the L2S mapping tables for Adaptive Symbol Constellation the
interference is collected burst-wise from a link level simulator and put in
bins to get an instantaneous, burst wise C/I mapping to be used in the system
simulator.
In addition to C/I also the D/I is collected. The D/I is defined as the ratio
between the strongest co-channel interferer and the rest of interference. The
strongest co-channel interferer could either be an external GMSK modulated co-
channel or the second, unwanted sub channel.
An MS receiver can experience interference from either GMSK modulated external
interference, external MUROS interference and/or the unwanted sub channel from
the α-QPSK constellation. The interference from packet data channels are not
modeled but if modeled it is expected to perform very similar to MUROS
modulation.
For each interferer scenario two different mappings are derived:
[SAIC and SAM]{.underline}
  1. The unwanted sub channel is stronger than the strongest external GMSK modulated co-channel interference.
  2. External GMSK modulated co-channel interference is stronger than the unwanted sub channel
non-SAIC
  1. The unwanted sub channel is stronger than the strongest external interferer.
  2. External interference is stronger than the unwanted sub channel.
NOTE: The difference between the two approaches is that the non-SAIC MS does
not take into account if the external interference is GMSK or not since it
does not have the capability to suppress the interference.
##### 8.2.3.1.1 Interference scenarios
Based on the agreed working assumptions that the L2S methodology should be
verified for,
  1. The SCPIR envisaged for the operation of the candidate technique
  2. Uncoded BER only
  3. The interference modulation envisaged to be present in the system,
the following scenarios have been identified for a DL MS receiver in
synchronous operation:
Table 8-17: Verification scenarios
* * *
**Test case** **Carrier mod** **Intf. mod** **Intf. scenario** **SCPIR** 1
GMSK GMSK MTS-1 - 2 GMSK QPSK MTS-1 - 3 GMSK GMSK MTS-2 - 4 GMSK QPSK MTS-2 -
5 α-QPSK GMSK MTS-1 * 6 α-QPSK QPSK MTS-1 * 7 α-QPSK GMSK MTS-2 * 8 α-QPSK
QPSK MTS-2 *
* * *
* Dependent on the MS type modeled.
NOTE: It has been assumed that all external MUROS interference is QPSK, and
not α-QPSK, modulated. This is considered a worst case scenario since the more
shifted the QPSK constellation is the more easily can the interference be
suppressed by a SAIC receiver.
Link simulations have been used to generate the link-2-system mappings while a
system simulator has been used for the verification.
##### 8.2.3.1.2 Raw BER verification levels
The raw BER has been verified for raw BER levels corresponding to normal
operation around 1 % FER for the speech codecs used in the MUROS study.
In the figure below it can be seen that appropriate raw BER levels are 2-20 %.
  * {width="6.689583333333333in" > height="4.365277777777778in"}
Figure 8-70: Raw BER and corresponding FER for speech codecs used in the
system simulations.
##### 8.2.3.1.3 Interference statistics
Interference is collected for each burst, separating each type of interferer.
For each burst the C/I and D/I is identified. The C/I is defined as the
carrier/sub carrier power-to-total interference ratio while the D/I is defined
as the strongest co-channel interferer to the rest of interferers.
##### 8.2.3.1.4 Adjacent channel interference
When calculating the total interference power there is no distinction of
whether the signal is an adjacent channel interferer or co channel interferer.
To get a common measure of the interference power irrespective of the type of
interferer the C/I needs to be defined at the receiver front end. There is no
impact to co channel interference since it will have the same spectral
properties as the carrier signal. However, for adjacent channel interference
the interference power at the receiver needs to be assessed. Link level
simulations have been used to define corresponding co-channel interference for
each level of adjacent channel interference. In the simulations QPSK modulated
interference is used in order for the SAIC receiver not to suppress the co
channel interferer.
  * {width="5.761805555555555in" > height="3.7666666666666666in"}
Figure 8-71: Performance difference between co channel and adjacent channel
interference.
It can be seen that the receiver filter seems to be able to mitigate the
adjacent channel interference by approximately 21-22 dB.
For each burst the adjacent channel interference power is mapped to a
corresponding co-channel interference power based on the plot above.
##### 8.2.3.1.5 Mappings
Examples of L2S mappings used in the evaluation for the SAIC receiver are
shown in the figures below.
  * {width="5.684027777777778in" > height="4.0625in"}
Figure 8-72: L2S mapping for SAIC receiver. 2^nd^ sub channel stronger than
external GMSK co-channel.
{width="5.721527777777778in" height="4.008333333333334in"}
Figure 8-73: L2S mapping for SAIC receiver. External co-channel interferer
stronger than 2^nd^ sub channel.
It can be seen that it is easier for the SAIC receiver to suppress the
unwanted sub channel than external co-channel interference. It is clear from
both maps that, given a C/I, the higher the D/I the better the performance.
#### 8.2.3.2 Verification, DL
The simulation assumptions are summarized in Table 8-18.

##### 8.2.3.2.1 SAIC

It can be seen that all scenarios there is a good correspondence between the

0.5 dB is observed. However, in most cases the difference in performance is
within 0.2 dB.
##### 8.2.3.2.2 non-SAIC

## 8.3 Impacts on the Mobile Station
### 8.3.1 Legacy mobile stations
The presented concept is compatible with legacy MS. No implementation impact
is foreseen. In addition, it should be noticed that legacy mobiles will gain
from both the sub channel specific power control on the DL and the proposed
frequency hopping scheme.
### 8.3.2 Mobile stations supporting Adaptive symbol constellation
Support of new TSCs will help improve link performance, spectral efficiency
and network planning. Thus, new training sequence codes must be defined in the
MS. The support of the new training sequence codes must be signalled to the
network.
In order to improve the link performance and ultimately the spectral
efficiency of the network, the MS receiver algorithms should be optimized to
cope with inter-sub-channel interference.
**Sub channel power control on the DL (α-QPSK)**
No additional implementation is needed to support sub channel power control on
the DL for an MS detecting its own sub channel, e.g. a SAIC capable MS.
If a joint detection algorithm is used, i.e. the two sub channels are detected
jointly, the power control parameter α needs to be estimated on a burst-by-
burst basis or by a filtering over several bursts. Alternatively, signalling
could be used to convey α. NOTE: Estimation of alpha is only needed for joint
detection receivers.
**Adaptive constellation rotation**
In order to support adaptive constellation rotation the MS must perform blind
detection of the rotation angle.
**Frequency hopping**
There is no impact to the legacy mobile allocated on the first sub channel.
The user on the second sub channel needs to support additional signalling and
the new hopping sequences.
## 8.4 Impacts on the BSS
The transmitter will need to implement a new linear modulation type. A
receiver capable of demodulating multiuser MIMO signals is also required. New
power control and channel allocation strategies must also be implemented. The
following list provides more details:
BSS shall be able to assign different TSC's to the two users. The choice of
TSC shall be made based upon the capabilities of the MS.
The transmitter shall implement the linear modulator. If a legacy BSS has
support for a linear $M$-PSK modulator, $M \geq 4$, then $\alpha$ can be
quantized to a set of discrete values and the legacy modulator re-used.
The transmitter should be able to support two rotations, which are used
dependent on the value of alpha.
The receiver shall be able to demodulate 2 simultaneous received signals from
two antenna branches. (I.e. a 2 user MIMO receiver is needed.).
The transmitter and receiver should support new signalling for frequency
hopping and new frequency hopping schemes.
The BSS shall implement new power control algorithms both in the uplink and
downlink. In the downlink it is necessary to ensure that each MS has a signal
to noise plus interference ratio high enough to successfully demodulate and
decode its intended signal. This is achieved by choosing the parameter
$\alpha$and the output power appropriately.
Adaptive symbol constellation will only impact the radio interface in terms of
increased channel capacity. Thus, the capacity of the Abis interface will have
to be increased in accordance with the increased number of channels that can
be supported by Adaptive Symbol Constellation.
## 8.5 Impacts on Network Planning
No impact on network planning is foreseen. The impact on system performance
due to a wider pulse shape is left FFS.

### 8.7.2 Compatibility objectives
**Maintenance of Voice Quality (C1)**
The capacity gains have been shown when using the same quality target for
channels not using adaptive symbol constellation and channels using adaptive
symbol constellation. Additionally, GSM HR has been investigated with the same
FER threshold as AMR codecs. Given the same FER level, the voice quality is
worse for GSM HR than for any AMR codec.
_Fulfilled_
**Support of legacy mobile stations (C2)**
Legacy, DARP Phase I, mobiles can be supported on the first sub channel, see
[8-10], while MS's supporting new training sequence codes are required for the
second sub channel.
Both the concept of downlink power control (α-QPSK) and the concept of
frequency hopping will support legacy mobiles. However, legacy mobiles will
experience no gains from adaptive constellation rotation.
The support of non DARP Phase I mobiles is still left FFS.
_Fulfilled (DARP Phase I MSs)_
_TBD (Non DARP Phase I MSs)_
**Implementation Impact to new Mobile Stations (C3)**
Compared to a legacy DARP Phase I receiver, the following additional support
is needed.
  * new training sequences
  * additional detection of rotation. (Note: Algorithms for modulation detection in EDGE capable terminals can be re-used.)
  * signaling procedure of frequency hopping
  * frequency hopping support,
**Implementation Impacts to BSS (C4)**
Transmitter:
  * additional constellation rotation
  * linear modulator for α-QPSK
Receiver
  * Dual antenna receiver becomes mandatory.
  * Demodulation algorithm of two simultaneous received signals
Transmitted and Receiver
  * new TSC support
  * support of frequency hopping concept
Dimensioning aspects of the Abis interface due to the increased channel
support needs to be taken into account.
**Impacts to Network Planning (C5)**
No impact is foreseen when using the linearized GMSK pulse shape. The impact
due to a wider pulse shape on the DL is left FFS.

# 9 Higher Order Modulations for MUROS
## 9.1 Concept Description
### 9.1.1 Downlink
#### 9.1.1.1 Speech multiplexing
For the downlink channel, several speech channels can be transmitted
simultaneously over a single physical channel. Each channel can be separately
encoded. This technique support all legacy speech codecs (TCH/FS, TCH/EFS,
TCH/AFS, TCH/WFS, TCH/HS, TCH/AHS), and separate DTX for each user. In the
case that AMR speech encoding is being used for one or more of the users, this
allows for independent selection of codec mode for each user, multiplexing of
legacy users. A diagram showing the concept of multiplexing four users is
shown in Figure 9-1.
Figure 9-1: Higher Order Modulation for MUROS in Downlink (4 users)
As can be seen in Figure 9-1, each user is separately encoded. After rate
matching, the users are multiplexed together. There are several policies the
multiplexer could take. One option is to fairly divide the resource among the
users. For example, by concatenating the users' messages and then bit
interleaving, or by allocating separate symbols for every user. In order to
allow power control between the users the number of bits the rate matching
outputs can be unequal. Another option that can be used is allocating each
user a bit (or bits) in the modulation constellation. This option allows
inherent power control, as the strength of bits is not equal. This is
discussed in more detail in the section on power control.
Using this method, one can multiplex 1 to 4 users on the same slot. As in
TCH/AFS, each speech frame is interleaved over 8 physical slots to allow as
large as possible time diversity. The four MUROS users are marked as
M0,...,M3. In each slot, up to 4 users are transmitted, depending on each
user's individual DTX status. The modulation level can be varied according to
the instantaneous number of users as shown in Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-2: Modulation according to Number of Configured Users
##### 9.1.1.1.1 Speech Multiplexing and Interleaving
The allocation of the symbols on the constellation is done according to the
order of bit definition in 45.004. In GMSK, S0 is the only bit in the
constellation, di. In QPSK, S0 is mapped to the first bit and S1 to the second
bit d2i and d2i+1 respectively. In 8PSK, S0, S1 and S2 are mapped to bits
d3i,, d3i+1 and d3i+2 respectively, and in 16QAM stream S0 to S3 are mapped to
bits d4i, d4i+1, d4i+2 and d4i+3 respectively. Using this definition, in 8PSK
modulation streams S0 and S1 are "strong" streams, as they are mapped to
strong bits, while S2 is a "weak" stream, as it mapped to a weak bit. In
16QAM, stream S0 and S1 are the strong streams and stream S2 and S3 are the
weak streams.
In case of 4 users, the stream allocation to user allocation is done in the
following way: M0 to S0, M1 to S1, M2 to S2 and M3 to S3. In case of only one
active user, that user will be mapped to the GMSK S0 stream. In other cases,
the mapping will depend on the instantaneous DTX status, as will be described
in the DTX subsection.
Each user that is transmitted has an allocated user stream in the
constellations. As the number of bits in each stream is equal to the legacy
number of bits in the TCH channel, speech multiplexing can be done as
currently done in TCH/AFS channels, with the interleaving onto the allocated
bits. As with legacy channels, adjacent speech frames are diagonally
interleaved in the same way.
The interleaving pattern used by each user is depending on the user number.
The interleaving is done in the following way:
Let C(k), k=0,...,455, be the coded bits after puncturing, and
I(j),j=0,...,455 be the coded bits after interleaving.
Define j as: j = 57*(k%8) + (49*k+14*index)%57, where ind the MUROS user
index, given in Table 9-0. The interleaving pattern is defined as I(j) = C(k).
Using this interleaving, user M0 has the the same legacy interleaving,
therefore if only M0 is transmitted, the legacy TCH/AFS slots are achieved.

#### 9.1.1.2 Modulation Schemes and Training Sequences
The proposal will re-use GMSK and 8-PSK modulation training sequences, and
16-QAM modulation training sequences defined for EGPRS2. In addition, 8
training sequences for QPSK modulation at normal symbol rate will need to be
defined. This can using the same method of producing the 16QAM/32QAM
sequences. A rotation of 3π/4 can be used to differentiate the modulation
scheme for blind modulation detection. The TSCs are summarized in Table 9-0a.

Constellation rotations can be as for EGPRS2, with the exception of the QPSK
configuration to support a legacy GMSK user. This is described in clause
9.1.1.3.
#### 9.1.1.3 Legacy GMSK MS Support
Support for legacy GMSK MSs can be provided with a modified QPSK modulation.
In this case, the resource can support up to 2 MSs, one of which can be a
legacy GMSK MS. The constellation rotation will be compatible with legacy GMSK
for transmission of this slot, i.e. π/2 per symbol period, as shown in Figure
9-3. Detection of the rotation will be by blind modulation detection, as for
detection between different modulation schemes for the regular speech
multiplexing. Figure 9-4 shows different configurations for multiplexing
legacy MSs, both full rate and half rate.
Figure 9-3: π/2 constellation rotation for legacy multiplexing
Figure 9-4: Downlink Configurations of MUROS with Legacy
#### 9.1.1.4 Codecs support and Achievable Code Rates
This HOM technique support all legacy speech codecs (TCH/FS, TCH/EFS, TCH/AFS,
TCH/WFS, TCH/HS, TCH/AHS), and separate DTX for each user. In full rate codec
is supported in the following way. Every legacy codec produce a payload of 456
bits. This payload is interleaved using the interleaving scheme described in
subsection 9.1.1.2. After interleaving, the payload bits are mapped to the
user stream over 8 slots as done the legacy full rate channels.
The achievable coding rate are equal to the legacy coding rate, as the same
payload size is maintained, i.e. 456 bits.
The support of the legacy codes is done in the following way. Every half rate
code produces 228 bits. Those bits are duplicated to produce a total of 456
bits. Ones 456 bits are achieved, we continue as in the full rate codecs,
i.e., interleaving and mapping on the appropriate stream.
As explained in the above text, the achievable code rate is the same as
achieve in the legacy codec for every modulation. As a reference, Table 9-1
summarized the TCH/AFS code rates for any modulation used.

#### 9.1.1.5 DTX
The decision for each DL user channel to activate DTX is independent,
depending on instantaneous speech activity. In the case that one or more users
enter DTX, a lower, more robust modulation can be used according to the number
of users instantaneously required. For example, where four users use 16-QAM, 3
users can use 8PSK, two users QPSK, and one user GMSK modulation.
Since information about which user or users enter DTX is not known a priori,
this information must be provided by signaling as side information. This can
be done as for the following example.
Each user of a logical channel is a priori assigned an identifier, so that the
user knows where to access the channel encoded bits. So, the user will always
know which vector of decoded bits to extract from a received burst. The
different DTX configurations are now considered.
##### 9.1.1.5.1 DTX Configuration Signaling
Signaling of the MUROS users that are active for a given slot transmission can
be done with a single bit.
Suppose that there 4 MUROS users, numbered for a given TDMA frame as M0, M1,
M2, and M3. Each MS is aware apriori of its index for this phase in the hop
sequence. This information is signaled at call setup. The interleaving order
is preserved also in the case that one or more of the channels enters DTX.
The signaling may then work as follows.
**_4 users - 16-QAM_**
All four users are transmitted. No signaling is required. User M0 is carried
on stream S0, M1 on S1, M2 on S2 and M3 on S3.
**_3 users - 8-PSK_**
One user has entered DTX. Four options are possible for transmitted channels.
A signal bit is used to indicate the appropriate channel configuration as
shown in Table 9-2.
Table 9-2: Signalled Bit Encoding according to DTX states
* * *
**S0 S1 S2**  
M0 M1 M2 0 M0 M1 M3 0 M0 M2 M3 1 M1 M2 M3 1
* * *
In the 8-PSK slot transmission there are 3 streams S0, S1 and S2, of encoded
channel bits, each equivalent in size to the payload carried by a GMSK slot.
The four users relate to the signaled bit as shown in Table 9-3. So for
example, when the signaled bit is set to 1, the MUROS user with index 2 (M2),
reads the third vector of bits, S2.
Table 9-3: Interpretation of Signaled Bit By MUROS user
+-------------------+--------+--------+--------+----------+ | **Signalled Bit** | **M0** | **M1** | **M2** | > **M3** | +-------------------+--------+--------+--------+----------+ | 0 | S0 | S1 | S2 | > S2 | +-------------------+--------+--------+--------+----------+ | 1 | S0 | S0 | S1 | > S2 | +-------------------+--------+--------+--------+----------+
**_2 users - QPSK_**
Two users have entered DTX. Six options are possible for transmitted channels.
A signal bit is used to indicate the appropriate channel configuration as
shown in Table 9-4.
Table 9-4: Signalled Bit Encoding according to DTX states
+----------------------------+---------------------+ | > **Transmitted channels** | > **Signalled Bit** | +----------------------------+---------------------+ | > **S0 S1** | | +----------------------------+---------------------+ | > M0 M1 | > 1 | +----------------------------+---------------------+ | > M0 M2 | > 0 | +----------------------------+---------------------+ | > M0 M3 | > 1 | +----------------------------+---------------------+ | > M1 M2 | > 0 | +----------------------------+---------------------+ | > M1 M3 | > 0 | +----------------------------+---------------------+ | > M2 M3 | > 1 | +----------------------------+---------------------+
In the QPSK slot transmission there are 2 streams, S0 and S1, of encoded
channel bits, equivalent is size to the payload carried by a GMSK slot. The
four users relate to the signaled bit as shown in Table 9-5. So for example,
when the signaled bit is set to 1, the MUROS user with index 2 (M2), reads the
third vector of bits, S2.
Table 9-5: Interpretation of Signaled Bit By MUROS user
* * *
**Signalled Bit** **M0** **M1** **M2** **M3** 0 S0 S0 S1 S1 1 S0 S1 S0 S1
* * *
**_1 user - GMSK_**
In the case that only a single user is not in DTX, no signaling is required.
All users on this timeslot/frequency will receive the slot, and use it to try
to decode a speech frame. However, only the user to whom the data is
transmitted will succeed in decoding the speech frame.
###### 9.1.1.5.1.1 Examples
**_M0 user_**
A user allocated M0 always reads the first stream of bits, irrespective of the
modulation used. Since the user order is preserved, the first stream S0 will
always carry M0 data, irrespective of the DTX state of other users, except in
the case that M0 itself has entered DTX. The DTX signaling bit can be ignored
by user M0. In the case that M0 is one of the users that is in DTX, the
received data will not be decodable, since the encryption scrambling will be
different from that for M0.
Note that MEAN_BEP & CV_BEP are parameters that are dependent only on uncoded
data, not on data at frame level. So frames that are not decoded are not
relevant to determining downlink channel quality.
Similarly, a user allocated to M3 always takes bits from the last stream of
the transmitted modulation, which is S3 for 16-QAM, S2 for 8-PSK, S1 for QPSK;
and, if GMSK is used, then the single stream of bits is used by M3 as the
received data for speech frame decoding. The DTX signaling bit can be ignored
by user M3.
**_M2 user_**
Suppose a user is allocated identifier M2 at setup together with 3 other
users, allocated as M0, M1 and M3. For 16-QAM modulation transmitted on the
downlink, M2 reads data bits from stream S2.
At a point in the call, one of the users on the downlink enters DTX. From the
start of the next interleaved speech frame, the modulation transmitted is now
8-PSK. At this point, as the next timeslots are received, user M2 is not yet
aware which user has entered DTX (including if it is M2 itself). After
receiving all the timeslots of the interleaved speech frame, the DTX signaling
information for that speech frame can be decoded. If the signaling bit is 0,
then bits for M2 are read from stream S2 (per Table 9-3) (corresponding to M3
being in DTX (or M2 itself)). If the signaling bit is 1, then bits for M2 are
read from stream S1 (corresponding to either M0 or M1 being in DTX). As for
the M0 example above, if it is M2 itself that has entered DTX, then the
received data will not be decodeable, but since the data is not directed to
M2, this is not relevant.
Suppose now that 2 users enter DTX, and QPSK is transmitted on the downlink.
If the DTX signaling bit is 0, then M2 reads its bits from the second stream
S1 (per Table 9-5) (corresponding to either M0 or M1, plus M3 (or M2)), being
in DTX. If the DTX signaling bit is 1, then bits for M2 are read from the
first stream S0 (corresponding to both M0 and M1 being in DTX).
In the case that 3 users enter DTX, and GMSK is transmitted on the downlink,
then bits for M2 are read from the single stream S0.
##### 9.1.1.5.2 Signalling Rate and Signaling Channel Coding
In order to signal the instantaneous user channel configuration for 8-PSK and
QPSK slot transmissions, one signaling bit is required. As the DTX status can
be changed every speech block, the required rate of the signaling is one
signaling bit per 4 slots. In order to make this transmission robust, it must
be encoded. A code rate of 1/8 is used. The code words are specified in Table
9-5a.
Table 9-5a: Signaling Bit Codewords
* * *
**Signaling bit** **Codeword** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
* * *
In order to convey the signaling codeword, 8 bits per 4 slots are needed to be
transmitted, that is 2 bits per slot. In QPSK modulation, this will affect
only one bit per user per slot, a total of 4 payload bits in one speech frame.
For example, for 12.2kbps AMR channel, this would change the channel encoding
rate from R=0.56 (250/448) to R=0.563 (250/444). The impact of this on speech
channel performance is expected to be negligible. Note that all simulation
results include impact of the signalling.
In 8PSK the same number of bits is needed per slot. In order to improve the
signaling performance, strong bits are used. Therefore user on stream S2 is
unaffected in the coderate, while user in stream S0 and S1 has the same impact
as in QPSK.
The signaling codeword is interleaved over 8 slots using the same way the
stealing bits are interleaved. The bits that are used to convey the signaling
are the strong bits. The symbol that is used to convey the signaling is symbol
number 116, such that in QPSK all the symbol is used and in 8PSK only the two
strong bits are used.
##### 9.1.1.5.3 Average Channel Usage
The average active part of the DTX of an MS is typically 60%. Assuming that we
multiplex 4 users simultaneously onto a physical channel, the distribution of
usage among the different modulation schemes can be estimated.
Assume that for a given timeslot, the usage of a given MS, is given by a
uniformly distributed variable,$p\left( u \right) = 0\text{.}6$. The usage of
DTX by each MS is independent, then the number of channels instantaneously in
use is distributed as:
This gives the modulation probability distribution as shown in Table 9-6. This
shows that most of the transmissions use a modulation no higher than 8PSK.
Only when none of the 4 users is in DTX, then the modulation rises to 16-QAM.

The DTX phase of an MS tends to be for a period of time, and does not change
from speech frame to speech frame. So the improvement in channel conditions is
localized to certain periods in time.
Some consideration of this has been given for the case where only 2 users are
multiplexed [9-8], where adaptive frequency hopping has been proposed to hop
between hopping sequences, and so better distribute the improvements available
from DTX phases. Although the case for 4 multiplexed users is somewhat better
in terms of improvements from DTX, since there are a number of multiplexed
users that can each enter DTX, the improvements still remain somewhat
localized. The concept presented in [9-8] can also be used for higher
modulations. A simple example is shown in Table 9-7 for 8 MSs, distributed
over 2 hopping sequences. Initially, the MSs are distributed {M0,M1,M2,M3} and
{M4,M5,M6,M7} over the 2 carriers in frame N. In frame N+1, the allocation is
changed to {M0,M1,M2,M7}, {M4,M5,M6,M3}. As can be seen in Table 9-7, the
second and third users are set as fixed during 4 frames. This fact is used in
the signaling coding that was described in subsection 9.1.1.5. After the 4
frames, users M2 and M6 change location in order to improve the DTX diversity.

#### 9.1.1.7 Power Control
Some measure of power control differential between the users supported within
the constellation is desirable, in addition to power control for the complete
constellation.
A proposal for a modified QPSK constellation was made in [9-9] in order to
allow a power differential between 2 users.
As shown in Figure 9-6, for each block of _k_ =4 bits, two of them (_b~1~_ and
_b~2~_) are mapped to the sub channel I, and the other two bits (_b~3~_ and
_b~4~_) are mapped to the sub channel Q. Because the two sub channels are
independent, different protection of the strong bits and weak bits can be
obtained by setting a proper value of _μ_ for each sub channel where the
distance between the two inner points are denoted by _d~i~_ and _d~q~_ for the
subchannel I and Q, respectively, while the distance between an outer point
and its neighbour is denoted by _μ~i~d~i~_ , and _μ~q~d~q~_ for the sub
channel I and Q, respectively (_μ~i~_ and _μ~q~_ are real numbers). In
general, _μ~q\ ~_ is not necessarily equal to _μ~i~_ , and, _d~q\ ~_ is not
necessarily equal to _d~i~_. These flexibilities make it possible to let all
of the four bits have different protection (Note that for _μ~i~= μ~q~_ =1.0
and _d~i~=d~q~_ , Figure 9-6 represents a regular 16-QAM constellation with
equal distance between all neighboring points.).
In the receiver, the real part and the imaginary part of the received complex
symbol can be separated, and a hard decision can be made for each bit
following the rules,
${\hat{b}}_{1} = \begin{matrix} \left{ 0\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ if\ Re}\left{ r
\right} > 0 \middle| \right.\ \ \end{matrix}$ (1)
${\hat{b}}_{2} = \begin{matrix} \left{ 0\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ if\ }\left|
\text{Re}\left{ r \right} \right|  0 \middle| \right.\ \ \end{matrix}$ (3)
${\hat{b}}_{4} = \begin{matrix} \left{ 0\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ if\ }\left|

#### 9.2.1.2 Interference Performance
##### 9.2.1.2.1 Co-channel Performance
This section shows simulation results for two speech users multiplexed on QPSK
modulation both in uplink and downlink, and four speech users multiplexed on
16-QAM modulation both in uplink and downlink. The conditions are co-channel
interferer with a TU3 iFH channel. For two all users and four users, the
legacy AMR coding schemes and puncturing were used.
Figure 9-14 shows the downlink performance achievable with the AMR 5.9kbps
codec for 2 and 4 users, as compared to the legacy single user 5.9kbps case.
Also shown are the 45.005 requirements for TCH/AFS12.2, TCH/AFS5.9 and
TCH/AHS5.9. The 2 user MUROS curve only requires a 1.2dB improvement over the
single user legacy case; it also exceeds the TCH/AFS5.9 requirement in 45.005
by around 3dB. The 4-user MUROS case exceeds the TCH/AHS5.9 requirements by
around 2dB. That is, with a 2dB degradation in C/I, double the number of
speech users can be supported as compared to the legacy requirements.
Figure 9-15 shows the downlink performance achievable with the AMR 12.2kbps
codec for 2 and 4 users, as compared to the legacy single user 12.2 kbps case.
Similarly to the 5.9 case, the 2-user MUROS case using the12.2kbps codec only
requires a 0.5dB improvement over the single user legacy case. The 4-user
MUROS case can also be supported with a C/I=15.5dB which, based on network
measurements done during Release 7 GERAN Evolution work, is very reasonable to
occur in networks.
Figure 9-16 shows the downlink performance for the case when only a half rate
traffic physical channel is allocated to MUROS users, as for instance when the
other half rate is allocated to legacy usage. The performance of 2-user MUROS
carrying AMR5.9kbps is compared to TCH/AFS5.9 and TCH/AHS5.9 performance. Also
shown are the 45.005 requirements for TCH/AHS5.9. It can be seen that an
improvement of only 0.5dB is needed to support 2 users over the half rate
resource. Also, the MUROS performance exceeds the TCH/AHS5.9 performance
requirement by 1dB. So, allocating part of the resource to a legacy user, does
not affect the ability to use the remainder of the resource in an effective
way for MUROS.

##### 9.2.1.2.3 Co-Channel Performance with Power Control
This section shows the range of power control available in the higher
modulations by use of mapping the user streams to the different strength bits
in the modulation constellation, as described earlier. In addition, this can
also be enhanced by modification of the constellation as proposed in Section
9.1.1.7.
The following Figures are shown for the 12.2 and 5.9 AMR full rate codecs, in
channel scenarios MTS-1 to MTS-4 with MUROS interference. For 2 users over
QPSK, a single line is shown as both bits in the constellation are of same
strength. For 3 users over 8-PSK, 2 lines are shown -- 2 users are with strong
bits, 1 with less strong. For 4 users over 16-QAM, 2 lines are shown -- 2
users with strong bits, 2 users with less strong. Additionally, markers
indicate 45.005 standard requirements where relevant. It can be seen that
performance of 3 and 4 users is quite similar. It can also be seen that by
simple mapping, it is possible to support speech users in conditions that are
only 6dB worse than legacy speech channels.

#### 9.2.1.3 MTS-1 to MTS-4 Performance
This section shows the performance of the different speech codecs over the
defined MUROS channels, MTS-1 to MTS-4.
In each plot, the interferer performance of the speech channel is shown for
relevant physical channel. Lines are shown for 1 user (black), 2 users (blue),
3 users (green) and 4 users (red). For the case of 3 and 4 co-allocated users,
2 curves are shown, corresponding to mapping of the stream to strong bits or
weak bits in the modulation constellation. For 3 users, 2 streams are on
strong bits, and one on weak bit stream. For 4 users, 2 users are on each of
the strong and weak bits.

## 9.3 Impacts on the Mobile Station
The presented concept is compatible with legacy MSs. Legacy MS designs that
already support modulations required for Release 7 require the following
changes
  * Support of new multiplexing schemes for multiuser speech

## 10.2 Training sequence evaluation and selection
The criteria for selection of TSC's were agreed at GERAN#39:
  * Legacy TSC is used on 1st subchannel
  * New proposed TSC is used on 2nd subchannel
  * Performance of TSC pairs is evaluated
  * Restriction to single interferer scenario MTS-1 with the interferer > either using GMSK or MUROS modulation type.
  * Both DL and ULwill be evaluated.
  * Evaluate in addition the cross correlation performance of new TSC's > whilst the evaluation method is left open [^11]
At GERAN 1 Adhoc on EGPRS2/WIDER/MUROS following agreements were achieved:
  * fixed pairs will be used for the training sequence evaluation. There > was no agreement to standardise training sequence pairs.
  * newly proposed TRS sets will be included in the TR but without > corresponding performance simulation results (in order not to > overload the TR).
  * selection could wait until after a WI is opened.
  * no new proposal for new training sequences will be accepted from > this point in time, unless it was shown to provide a significant > performance improvement of (\~0.5 dB).
At MUROS telco#7 following agreements were achieved:
  * Contributions can be provided by companies to check the cross > correlation properties of unpaired sequences at GERAN#40.
  * Voting will be used at GERAN#40 to select the best sequence among > the candidate sets.
At GERAN#40 it was agreed to freeze the work related to the evaluation of the
best TSC set, until a work item is started. Hence further training sequence
evaluation as well as final selection of the TSC set will take place within
the sucessive work item VAMOS.
At GERAN#41 an offline session on further proceeding related to the TSC
evaluation work was held [10-10]. In the following GERAN working group 1
meeting it was agreed that the proposed candidate in section 10.1.7 (RIM-2) is
selected for VAMOS.

# 11 Associated Control Channel Design
## 11.1 Shifted SACCH
### 11.1.1 Concept Description
The TDMA frame mapping on the second MUROS sub channel is rearranged so that
the allocation of the SACCH frame does not collide with that in the first
MUROS sub channel where legacy TDMA frame mapping is applied. This can be done
both for a full rate channel and for a half rate channel. The new mapping on
one MUROS sub channel should be kept once assigned, regardless of the state of
the pairing MUROS sub channel.
One approach of designing the new mapping is to simply swap the SACCH frame
with a specific TCH frame within a 26-multiframe. To minimize the impacts on
both BSS and MS (e.g. frame scheduling, and alignment of measurement reports
etc.), the chosen allocation of the SACCH frame is respectively the 13^th^
frame for a full rate channel, the 13^th^ frame for the 1^st^ half rate sub
channel, and the 24^th^ frame for the 2^nd^ half rate sub channel.
Possible channel organizations are shown in Figure 11-1 through Figure 11-5,
where only one time slot per TDMA frame is considered. It can be seen that
such an allocation scheme nicely keeps the speech block interval the same as
that in legacy mapping (i.e. 7 or 8 frames).

Figure 11-5: Shifted SACCH with four half rate TCHs
With the new TDMA frame mapping, more possibility is given to enhance the
SACCH performance and thus maintain the relative performance between SACCH and
TCH in MUROS. For example, a SACCH frame on one MUROS sub channel can now
benefit from the DTX gains brought by the pairing MUROS sub channel.
Furthermore, the network can tune the SCPIR so that the MUROS sub channel
carrying a SACCH frame has a larger portion of transmitted power, therefore
obtains improved SACCH performance.
The idea can be applied both in the uplink and in the downlink.
### 11.1.2 Performance Characterization
#### 11.1.2.1 Link Level Performance
Link level simulations have been performed in three stages. First the
degradation of SACCH performance due to the introduction of MUROS is studied.
Then the degradation of relative performance between SACCH and TCH due to the
introduction of MUROS is presented. Finally the performance of Shifted SACCH
is shown both with different SCPIRs and in DTX.

Figure 11-6 shows that the performance of SACCH in MUROS can not meet the
requirement for a DARP receiver in GSM specifications in the MTS-1 scenario.
The degradation is 6dB. Figure 11-7 shows the result in MTS-2 scenario, where
the degradation is 4dB.

###### 11.1.2.1.2.4 Performance Analysis
The relative performance between SACCH and AFS4.75/AHS4.75 in legacy DARP can
be derived from Figure 11-8, whilst the relative performance between SACCH and
AFS4.75/AHS4.75 for scenario A, B, C and D can be respectively derived from
Figure 11-9 to Figure 11-12. These are listed in Table 11-4 for AFS4.75 and
Table 11-5 for AHS4.75. It can be seen that the degradation of relative
performance between SACCH and AHS4.75 can be up to 1.1dB (in scenario D).

give the corresponding results for TCH/AHS5.9. Table 11-7 and Table 11-8

It can be seen e.g. that in MTS-1 the performance of SACCH is improved by
5.2dB given an SCPIR of 7dB, whilst the TCH of the pairing sub channel only
sees a slight degradation of 0.5dB.
##### 11.1.2.1.4 Performance of Shifted SACCH in DTX
###### 11.1.2.1.4.1 Performance evaluation methods in DTX
Figure 11-17 illustrates how to calculate the performance improvement of
Shifted SACCH in the case of DTX. Symbol 'a' denotes the relative performance
between SACCH and TCH in legacy DARP when DTX is off. Symbol 'b' denotes the
relative performance between SACCH and TCH in MUROS when DTX is off. Symbol
'c' denotes the performance improvement of DTX for TCH. Symbol 'd' denotes the
performance improvement of SACCH when it's shifted and the pairing sub channel
is in DTX.
Figure 11-17: Relative performance between SACCH and TCH with and without DTX
According to Figure 11-17 three quantities regarding the degradation of
relative performance between SACCH and TCH in MUROS are derived and explained
as follows:
$\text{Degrad}_{\text{MUROS_DTX_OFF}} = b - a$, when there's no Shifted SACCH,
and DTX is off.
$\text{Degrad}_{\text{MUROS_DTX_ON}} = b - a + c$, when there' no Shifted
SACCH, and DTX is on.
$\text{Degrad}_{\text{SHIFTED_SACCH_DTX_ON}} = b - a + \text{c-d}$, when
there's Shifted SACCH, and DTX is on.
It can be seen that the degradation is worsened by 'c' dB when DTX is on. But
this can be improved by 'd' dB if Shifted SACCH is introduced. Since 'c-d' is
less than 0 in some scenarios, the degradation introduced by both MUROS and
DTX might be completely compensated by Shifted SACCH, making
$\text{Degrad}_{\text{SHIFTED_SACCH_DTX_ON}}$ close to 0.
###### 11.1.2.1.4.2 Simulation assumptions
The simulation assumptions are shown in Table 11-9. The TCH performance
without DTX has been normalized so that it reaches 1% FER @ C/I1=0 dB. DTX was
modelled by a Markov state model with an activity factor of 0.6 and an average
activity period of 1s. Scenario A as defined in Table 11-3 was selected to be
simulated in MTS-1. Scenario D was selected to be simulated in MTS-2.

Table 11-10 and Table 11-11 provide the relative performance between SACCH and
AHS4.75 in MUROS, and the degradation of relative performance compared with
legacy DARP. It can be seen that the degradation is up to 1.3dB in MTS-1 when
DTX is on, but is reversed to be -0.1dB when Shifted SACCH is employed. In
MTS-2 the results are similar, where the degradation is up to 1.7dB when DTX
is on, but is reduced to be only 0.1dB by Shifted SACCH.

###### 11.1.2.1.5.5 Performance analysis
In order to evaluate the performance improvement of Shifted SACCH for VAMOS
level II and legacy non-SAIC receivers, the relative performance of legacy
SAIC receiver in non VAMOS mode, 1.8 dB (see [11-7]), is chosen as the
reference point. The following comparisons are between the reference point and
the simulation results shown above.
As shown in Table 11-13 and Table 11-14, comparing with the reference point,
the relative performance degradation of VAMOS level II receiver without
shifted SACCH is 0.6dB to 1.5dB while that with shifted SACCH is -0.7dB to
0dB. The negative value here indicates an improvement on the relative
performance.
As shown in Table 11-15 and Table 11-16, comparing with the reference point,
the relative performance degradation of non-SAIC receiver without shifted
SACCH is 1.2dB to 1.9dB while that with shifted SACCH is 0.5dB to 0.8dB.
It is clear that shifted SACCH is a helpful solution to keep the relative
performance of SACCH at the legacy non-VAMOS level with the DTX gain.
Even without DTX shifted SACCH also has some gains by tuning SCPIR of the
SACCH frame. That means a VAMOS sub channel could have different SCPIRs
between TCH and SACCH.
To take Figure 11-22 as an example, if SCPIR in TCH is -4dB and SCPIR in SACCH
is 0dB, the relative performance would be 0dB which is much less than that of
a legacy SAIC receiver (1.8dB).
It may be argued that the performance of paired user will be degraded. It has
also been considered in this evaluation. As shown in Figure 11-26, if the
paired user is a SAIC receiver, the degradation is only about 0.2dB. Even if
the paired user is a non-SAIC receiver, the degradation is no more than 1dB.
### 11.1.3 Impacts on the Mobile Station
At least one of the mobiles in a MUROS pair will need to support the Shifted
SACCH concept.
#### 11.1.3.1 Legacy mobile stations
The presented concept is compatible with legacy MS. No implementation impact
is foreseen. In addition, it should be noticed that the SACCH performance of a
legacy mobile on one MUROS sub channel will obtain the same gains as that of
the mobile on the pairing sub channel where Shifted SACCH is employed.
#### 11.1.3.2 Mobile stations supporting Shifted SACCH
A mobile station supporting Shifted SACCH shall support the new TDMA frame
mapping and may be allocated on the second MUROS sub channel. Changes to the
scheduling of speech frames should be considered in the implementation,
although it is trivial. The support of Shifted SACCH must be signalled to the
network, either by the indication of the support of MUROS if Shifted SACCH is
mandatory in MUROS or by a stand-alone indicator if Shifted SACCH is optional
in MUROS.
The contents of measurement results are not affected by shifting the
allocation of SACCH frames.
No impact on hardware implementation of the mobile station is foreseen.
### 11.1.4 Impacts on the BSS
The BTS transmitter and receiver shall support the new TDMA frame mapping.
The misalignment of SACCH frame numbers on the two MUROS sub channels should
be taken into account. The BSS may need to synchronize the measurement reports
for both sub channels in order to perform sub channel power control. This
should be done both for the downlink and for the uplink. No other impact is
foreseen on downlink power control. For uplink power control, the PC commands
for the two MUROS sub channels may be jointly decided but will not be sent out
at the same time. Since the time difference is only several frames (e.g. one
frame in Figure 11-2), and the power control period is typically 1.5s, there's
almost no impact on the performance of uplink power control.
The performance of TCH is fully maintained if there's no power imbalance.
However, the BSS may assign a positive SCPIR to the sub channel containing a
SACCH frame. In this case the performance of SACCH is clearly improved but at
the same time the performance of TCH on the pairing sub channel will be
slightly degraded (see 11.1.2.1.3).

# 13 Conclusions
During the MUROS feasibility study, opened at GERAN#36, a number of candidate
techniques have been investigated that are aimed at increasing voice capacity
of GERAN in the CS domain in order of a factor of two per BTS transceiver by
creating new types of speech traffic channels in GERAN. These candidate
techniques included into this Technical Report are described in chapter 6 to
9, namely
  * Speech capacity enhancement using DARP (chapter 6).
  * Orthogonal Sub Channels (chapter 7).
  * Adaptive Symbol Constellation (chapter 8).
  * Higher Order Modulations for MUROS (chapter 9).
The four above listed candidate techniques were evaluated against the defined
performance and compatibility objectives defined in chapter 4. The evaluation
against performance objectives is reflected in chapter 12 in Table 12-1 and
against compatibility objectives in chapter 12 in Table 12-2. .
To summarize this evaluation it was seen that the second and the third
candidate technique fulfill the performance and compatibility objectives best,
whilst the first three candidate techniques have major conceptual
commonalities.
Among these three candidate techniques the Adaptive Symbol Constellation
concept has been identified to include techniques common to the co-TCH and the
Orthogonal Sub Channels proposals. The solution for the uplink is identical
for these three concepts. Voice capacity is increased by multiplexing two
users simultaneously on the same radio resource defined by a single time slot,
specific ARFCN and specific sequence of TDMA frame numbers as defined for full
rate and half rate GSM speech channels.
It is the intention to leave this feasibility study open in order to further
investigate enhancements for Rel-9 and beyond. In this context the Higher
Order Modulation proposal will be futher studied.
