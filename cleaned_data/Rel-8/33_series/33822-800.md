# 1 Scope
This document studies the security architecture, i.e. the security features
and the security mechanisms for inter-access mobility between 3GPP access
system and non-3GPP access systems. For the general architecture for inter-
access mobility cf. TR 23.882. This report is meant to provide more detail on
the security aspects of inter-access mobility.
The scope should be extended to the mobility between two **non-3GPP** access
systems, which interwork with 3GPP core entities. An example would be the
mobility between two WLAN access systems providing 3GPP IP access.
Disclaimer: This TR reflects the discussions held in 3GPP SA3 while 3GPP SA3
was working towards TS 33.402 [14]. This TR may therefore be useful to better
understand the basis on which decisions in TS 33.402 [14] were taken, and
which alternatives were under discussion. However, none of the text in this TR
shall be quoted as reflecting 3GPP's position in any way. Rather, 3GPP's
position on security for non-3GPP access to EPS is reflected in the normative
text in TS 33.402 [14]. Information in the TR may be inaccurate and outdated.
One example of outdated text can be found in clauses 4.1 and 4.2 on
alternatives for authentication protocols. The choices of authentication
protocols finally made by 3GPP can be found in TS 33.401 [13] and TS 33.402
[14] respectively.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following apply:
**Access network:** one of following access network: GPRS IP access, WLAN 3GPP
IP access, WLAN Direct IP access LTE, WiMax, etc.
**Data origin authentication:** The corroboration that the source of data
received is as claimed.
**WLAN 3GPP IP Access:** Access to an IP network via the 3GPP system.
**WLAN Direct IP Access:** Access to an IP network is direct from the WLAN AN.
**3GPP - WLAN Interworking:** Used generically to refer to interworking
between the 3GPP system and the WLAN family of standards.
**Trusted Access:** A non-3GPP IP Access Network is defined as a \"trusted
non-3GPP IP Access Network\" if the 3GPP EPC system chooses to trust such
non-3GPP IP access network. The 3GPP EPC system may choose to trust the
non-3GPP IP access network operated by the same or different operators, e.g.
based on business agreements. Specific security mechanisms may be in place
between the trusted non-3GPP IP Access Network and the 3GPP EPC to avoid
security threats. The decision whether a specific non-3GPP IP Access Network
is trusted or untrusted is up to the 3GPP EPC operator, and is not based on
the specific link-layer technology adopted by the non-3GPP IP Access Network.
**Source access system** : in handover situations, this is the access system,
from which the UE is handed over.
**Target access system** : in handover situations, this is the access system,
to which the UE is handed over.

# 4 Authentication protocols across access systems
Editor's note: it will be decided later if this section is needed in the final
report.
It is assumed that an SAE user has a USIM which is used as user credential in
authentication.
Authentication protocols are assumed to be run between the UE and an
authentication server in the home network. It is likely there will always be a
3G AAA server to terminate authentication protocols in SAE, but this is still
to be decided by SA2 (i.e. it is still to be decided whether always AAA
protocols, e.g. DIAMETER, will be used to carry authentication data, or
whether MAP may still be used). When AKA is used then the 3G AAA server will
interface with a 3G Authentication Centre.
Even for one user, the type of authentication protocol depends on the type of
access network. E.g. for I-WLAN EAP-AKA may be used, whereas for UTRAN UMTS
AKA will be used.
## 4.1 UMTS AKA
UMTS AKA will be used across UTRAN. It is still to be decided by SA3 whether
UMTS AKA or EAP-AKA will be used over LTE.
## 4.2 EAP-AKA
EAP-AKA may be used across I-WLAN and for WiMAX.
## 4.3 Others
# 5 Establishment of security contexts in the target access system
Each type of access system may require there own security contexts, which may
need to be available to protect the access network. An example is an MSK key
in a WLAN access system using an EAP method for authentication and key
agreement. The MSK is then used to derive further keys.
An example of an access system more complex than WLAN and requiring more
security contexts to be set up is WiMAX. WiMAX does not only need keys for the
protection of the link layer, but e.g. also keys to protect Mobile IP
signalling of the WiMAX-internal Mobile IP (CMIP or PMIP) layer providing
WiMAX-internal mobility, which is different from the SAE Mobile IP layer
providing mobility between access systems, of which at least one is non-3GPP.
There may also be access systems, which do not require any security context,
e.g. a DSL-based access system relying on physical security.
The establishment of these security contexts in the access system may be done
in two ways:
with the support of SAE;
without the support of SAE.
## 5.1 Establishment of security contexts with the support of SAE
In this case, the credentials the UE shares with the 3G AAA server are used to
establish security contexts in the access system. An example of this case is
I-WLAN Direct IP access, where the SIM or USIM are used to establish MSK
required to protect the WLAN link layer. Another example is likely WiMAX: the
WiMAX Forum is currently working on solutions for 3G-WiMAX interworking, which
would allow to bootstrap WiMAX-internal security contexts from a key derived
from a run of EAP-AKA between the UE and the 3G AAA server.
## 5.2 Establishment of security contexts without the support of SAE
In this case, credentials other than those available in 3G networks are used
to establish security contexts in the non-3GPP access system. An example of
this case is WiMAX when WiMAX-specific credentials are used to set up IP
connectivity across WiMAX. SAE plays no role in this set up, so the
establishment of these security contexts is out of scope of SAE.
It is assumed that the SAE user always uses a USIM on UICC to perform mutual
authentication and establish security contexts with the Home Network.
It is to be decided by SA3 whether a UE-PDG tunnel is required.
# 6 Establishment of IPsec tunnel between UE and PDG across the target
non-3GPP access system (if required)
One of the two variants of the S2 interface in the SAE architecture, cf. TR
23.882, allows to connect an access system to the evolved SAE packet core via
an IPsec tunnel between the UE and a PDG. WLAN 3GPP IP access is an example of
the use of such a tunnel, but WLAN is not the only access system which may be
connected in this way. This section deals with the roaming of a UE between an
access system (old) to another access system (new), for the case that at least
the target access system requires such a UE-PDG tunnel.
The level of security achieved in certain deployments of non-3GPP IP access
networks though internal security mechanisms (including confidentiality,
integrity protection, protection of signalling, key management, etc) of some
such non-3GPP IP access networks may be trusted by the 3GPP Evolved Packet
Core (EPC) operator. In such case, no additional security mechanisms (e.g.
IPSec tunnels from the UE to the EPC) are required. in the sense that the
non-3GPP IP access network can interwork with the 3GPP EPC without relying on
an IPsec tunnel to the UE. Such non-3GPP IP access networks are referred to
here as \"trusted non-3GPP IP access networks\". The decision whether a
specific non-3GPP IP access network is trusted or untrusted is up to the 3GPP
EPC operator and is not based on the specific link-layer technology adopted by
the non-3GPP IP access network.
If the non-3GPP IP access network is trusted (i.e. based on business, roaming
and interconnection agreements), the need for a PDG functionality to connect
the non-3GPP IP access to the EPC is FFS.
## 6.1 The source access system has a UE-PDG tunnel
An example of this case is mobility between two I-WLAN 3GPP IP access systems.
The problem to be solved is to retain the IPsec tunnel even when the IP
address of the UE changes due to mobility.
There are two cases here: the PDG remains the same or the PDG changes.
If PDG remains the same, the existing IPsec tunnel could be maintained. In
order to achieve this, a mechanism proposed in TR 23.882, Annex E, is MOBIKE.
For MOBIKE to work, it is required that the PDG remains the same while the UE
moves.
If the PDG changes, then it is not a matter of maintaining the IPSec tunnel,
but creating a new one with the target PDG. In such case, the focus becomes
the mechanisms on the S2 interface, not what happens between the new PDG and
the UE.
Another possible solution to retain the IPsec tunnel when the PDG remains
fixed would be the use of an IP mobility mechanism (e.g. Mobile IP). The
Mobile IP Home Agent would have to be e.g. located between the PDG and the UE,
but close to the PDG, ensuring that the outer IP address of the IPsec tunnel
remains constant, even while the UE moves and acquires a new local IP address.
The adoption of MIP for mobility is FFS.
If the PDG changes, then it is not a matter of maintaining the IPSec tunnel,
but creating a new one with the target PDG. In such case, in addition, to the
establishment of the new IPsec tunnel, the mobility of the PDG has to be
handled by the S2 interface.
## 6.2 The source access system does not have a UE-PDG tunnel
An example of this case is mobility between a 3GPP access system, such as LTE
or UTRAN, and an I-WLAN 3GPP IP access system. The problem to be solved is to
set up the IPsec tunnel in the target system in an efficient way.
Neither MOBIKE nor an additional layer of Mobile IP will help here.
# 7 Security for IP based mobility
There may be several layers of Mobile IP being used in a complete SAE system,
including access networks. E.g. there is a WiMAX-internal Mobile IP layer. The
considerations in this section are concerned with the outermost such layer,
where the related Home Agent 3GPP HA resides in the 3G network. It is still to
be decided if the HA is located in the SAE anchor, cf. architecture in section
4.
## 7.1 General requirement
Major security threats related to IP mobility, when the procedures are not
properly secured, are:
\- IP address ownership needs to be verified else redirection attacks will
happen
\- Traffic sent to a target redirected elsewhere
\- Attacker can blackhole traffic to a victim
\- Attacker can insert itself on-path as a Man-in-the-Middle
\- Redirecting traffic for someone to a victim
\- Leads to (D)DoS (distributed denial of service) 3rd party bombing
\- Consequently charging can be confused
\- (D)Dos attack on mobility anchor
Key handling principle for inter-3GPP HO:
> Before handover from EUTRAN to non-3GPP IP access network and/or from
> non-3GPP IP access network to EUTRAN, UE and EPS core network use the
> present key and the same key derivation function to derive the new key,
> which is to be used after handover.
(From S3-070732)
Some of the main problems that need to be considered when defining secuity
context transfer optimizations for non-3GPP/3GPP handovers are:
  * Security (avoiding negative impact on LTE/UMTS security)
  * User privacy related to identity management
  * AAA architecure misaligmnent between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses
  * Difficulty of defining a unique reference point for (secure) inter-access security context transfer.
  * Possible standardization impact outside 3GPP (IETF, IEEE).
These shall be taken into account when looking at optimizations for handovers
between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses.
There are different kinds of make-before-break solutions using pre-
authentication. This pre-authentication could take place either at the time of
hand-over preparation, or (for e.g. single-radio terminals) the authentication
could (perhaps) be prepared at the initial attach. It is an agreed working
assumption that solutions based on pre-authentication should be the focus of
the SA3 study for authentication optimizations for handovers between 3GPP and
non-3GPP accesses
## 7.2 Host based Mobility
### 7.2.1 Security associations used with Mobile IP
Figure 1 gives an overview of the MIP security associations which need to be
present irrespective of the version of Mobile IP used. More security
associations may be required for certain versions of Mobile IP. E.g. for
Mobile IP v4 with a Foreign Agent, security associations between MN and FA,
and FA and HA are needed.
Figure 1: Overview of the security architecture for MIP
The needed security associations are:
\- A security association between the UE and 3GPP AAA. It is assumed that the
3GPP AAA in HPLMN is in charge of user authentication and authorization. This
security association is based on a long-term secret.
\- A security association between the UE and 3GPP MIP HA. This security
association is established dynamically.
\- A security association between 3GPP MIP HA and 3GPP AAA server in the same
network. Typically, this security association is static. NDS/IP could be used
when proxy AAA is used in roaming case. See TS 33.210 for more detail
information [4].
### 7.2.2 Security protocols used with Mobile IP
1\. The security association between the MN and 3GPP AAA is used for (mutual)
authentication. In our context, the authentication protocol may be e.g. EAP-
AKA. This protocol is independent of Mobile IP, but keys derived from a run of
this protocol may be used for Mobile IP purposes.
2\. The security association between the MN and 3GPP MIP HA is used for MIP
signalling integrity protection. The protocols used depend on the version of
Mobile IP. To give examples:
MIPv4: Home agent and mobile nodes shall be able to perform message
authentication according to RFC 3344. MN-HA key agreed between HA and MN
during MIP authentication is used to compute the digest in the Mobile-Home
Authentication Extension according to RFC3344. The Mobile-Home Authentication
Extension is used to provide integrity of signalling between Mobile Node and
Home Agent. HMAC-MD5 shall be used as authentication algorithm with a key size
128 bit. HA will compute the UDP payload (RRQ or RRP data), all prior
extensions, the type, length and SPI of the extension with MN-HA key in MIP
Req-resp. MN uses with HMAC-MD5 to verify the received message from HA.
For MIPv4 with a foreign agent, more security associations are needed, as
mentioned in the previous subsection. RFC3344 can also be used for these. The
foreign agent shall be able to support message authentication using HMAC-MD5
and key size of 128 bits, with a key distribution mechanism (FFS).
MIPv6: IPsec is specified as the means of securing signalling messages between
the Mobile Node and Home Agent for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) in RFC3776. RFC4285
proposes an alternate method for securing MIPv6 signalling messages between
Mobile Nodes and Home Agents. The alternate method consists of a
MIPv6-specific mobility message authentication option that can be added to
MIPv6 signalling messages.\ The alternate method is entirely based on shared
secrets and does not use IPsec.
3\. The security association between 3GPP MIP HA and 3GPP AAA server in the
same network is used to securely transport the MN-HA keys from AAA server to
MIP HA. It may not be needed if the interface between AAA server and HA is
secured by other means.
Home agent and mobile nodes may perform message authentication whenever it is
needed.
## 7.3 Bootstrapping of Mobile IP parameters
### 7.3.1 General
It would be undesirable for SAE if the UE had to obtain security credentials
to be used specifically for Mobile IP signalling security. Rather, the
security associations required for Mobile IP should be able to be derived from
security credentials already available. In the case of SAE, this means that it
should be possible to derive the security associations required for Mobile IP
from the USIM.
Authentication between the MN and the network shall be performed as. A
subscriber, who wants to use MIP, will have its subscriber profile located in
the 3GPP AAA in the Home Network. The subscriber profile will contain
information on the subscriber that may not be revealed to an external partner,
At MIP registration , during a change of location between different access
networks by matching the request with the subscriber profile, if the
subscriber is allowed to continue with the request or not.
### 7.3.2 RFC3957 used in conjunction with GBA
NOTE: this subsection applies only to MIPv4.
MN-HA key generation & distribution based on RFC 3957. This method uses pre-
shared secret between MS and AAA server to establish a shared secret between
MS and HA and / or MS and FA.
Figure 2: MN-HA key generation & distribution
1\. During initial MIPv4 registration, MS includes a new extension (called the
MN-HA Key Generation Nonce Request extension [RFC 3957]) in RRQ to request for
a nonce from HAAA. The RRQ also contains the MS's credential in the MN-AAA
authenticator extension.
2\. FA sends DIAMETER/RADIUS Access-Request to HAAA to authenticate the MS
credential.
3\. If the MS is authenticated successfully, the HAAA returns DIAMETER/RADIUS
Access-Accept.
4\. FA forwards the RRQ to the HA.
NOTE: If co-located care-of address mode is used, then RRQ message will be
sent from MS to HA directly without FA in above picture
5\. HA sends DIAMETER/RADIUS Access-Request to HAAA. In case of Roaming, the
message will send through VAAA to HAAA. The DIAMETER/RADIUS Access-Request
contains the MN-HA SPI attribute to request for a MN-HA key to HAAA that the
MN-HA key needs to be derived. The HA may include the MS credential in the
DIAMETER/RADIUS Access-Request.
Editor's note: it's FFS if it's possible for a HA in the visited network.
6\. HAAA selects a nonce and derives the MN-HA key from the MN-AAA shared
secret, MS's NAI, and the nonce.
7\. HAAA returns DIAMETER/RADIUS Access-Accept that contains the MN-HA key and
the nonce.
8\. The HA sends RRP with a new extension (called the Generalized MN-HA Key
Generation Nonce Reply Extension [RFC 3957]) carrying the key generation
nonce, and the MN-HA authenticator computed from the MN-HA key. The new
extension must precede the MN-HA authenticator. (FA forwards the RRP to the
MS)
9\. The MS derives the MN-HA key and uses it to verify the MN-HA authenticator
in the RRP.
One possible way is to use GBA in conjunction with RFC 3957. In this case HAAA
is associated with NAF.
Figure 3: Using GBA to derive and distribute MN-HA Keys (HAAA as NAF)
Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) allows bootstrapping of shared
secrets between a UE/MN and the home network (Bootstrapping Service Function,
BSF), which can then be used to derive further shared secrets to be used
between MS and a Network Application Function(NAF).
Two options for using GBA in the inter access mobility authentication are
considered:
\- using GBA to derive the MN-HA Keys, in which case the HA is used as NAF
and.
\- using GBA to provision MN-AAA Keys, in which case HAAA is used as a NAF.
Figure 5 shows how GBA could be used to derive and distribute MN-HA Keys when
HAAA as NAF, i.e. HAAA is associated with a Network Application Function
(NAF).
1\. The MN performs a bootstrapping procedure with the BSF and generates a
(master) shared secret, Ks. Bootstrapping procedure is performed between the
UE/MS and the BSF (which is located in the home network). During
bootstrapping, mutual authentication is performed between the MS and the home
network, and a bootstrapping key, Ks, will be generated by both the UE/MS and
the BSF. Associated with the Ks include a Bootstrapping Transaction Identifier
(B-TID) and a lifetime of the Ks.
NOTE: This procedure is only needed during initial registration (and it can be
done before the MIP registration). It is not repeated at every HO (Handover).
The only time it needs to be repeated is when the key is about to expire. But
even in this case, the GAA procedure is done \"offline\"---i.e. the next MIP
registration does not need to wait for GAA procedure to complete.
2\. MN can then start MIP related signalling with the HA, which in turn
contacts the HAAA.
3\. HA then contacts to HAAA using Diameter/ RADIUS. **Note** : in the
baseline document only RADIUS message is shown in the figure and the text.
However, both Diameter and RADIUS can be used.
4\. The HAAA, acting as a NAF, does not have the MN-AAA key, as the MN-AAA key
is supposed to be generated by the BSF using Ks and other inputs to a KDF (key
derivation function). Therefore, the HAAA will contact the BSF and fetch the
MN-AAA key (Ks_(ext/int)_NAF of the HAAA) needed to authenticate the MN.
5\. MN-HA keys are then derived from the MN-AAA Key using RFC 3957.
NOTE: If foreign agents (FA) are used, then foreign agent use Diameter/RADIUS
to communication with HAAA.
Editor's note: it needs to check how to send the B-TID in MIP registration
message.
### 7.3.3 Use GBA to generate MN-HA key
NOTE: This subsection applies to MIPv4and MIPv6.
In this alternative authentication method, HA is associated with NAF.
Home Agent (HA) is associated with a NAF, and Ks_(ext/int)_NAF would be used
as MN-HA key: the MN performs a bootstrapping procedure with the BSF and
generates a (master) shared secret, Ks. After that, the MN can start MIP
related signalling with the HA, which in turn contacts the BSF to fetch MN-HA
key.
Figure 4: Overview of GBA operations
1\. Bootstrapping procedure is performed between the UE/MS and the BSF (which
is located in the home network). During bootstrapping, mutual authentication
is performed between the MS and the home network, and a bootstrapping key, Ks,
will be generated by both the UE/MS and the BSF. Associated with the Ks
include a Bootstrapping Transaction Identifier (B-TID) and a lifetime of the
Ks.
NOTE: This procedure is only needed during initial registration (and it can be
done before the MIP registration). It is not repeated at every HO (Handover).
The only time it needs to be repeated is when the key is about to expire. But
even in this case, the GAA procedure is done \"offline\"---i.e. the next MIP
registration does not need to wait for GAA procedure to complete.
2\. Once bootstrapping is completed, UE/MS can make use of the bootstrapped
security association with a network application server, called the Network
Application Function (NAF). To do so, the UE/MS communicates with the NAF. The
UE/MS conveys to the NAF the B-TID.
3\. The UE/MS derives the application specific session keys Ks_(ext/int)_NAF
using a pre-defined key derivation function (KDF), with Ks, identifier of the
NAF (NAF_Id), as well as other information as input. Upon receiving the
request from UE/MS in step 2, the NAF contacts the BSF over the Zn to request
the Ks_(ext/int)_NAF. The NAF provides the B-TID received from the UE/MS, and
provides its own identity (NAF_Id). The BSF derives the Ks_(ext/int)_NAF in
the same way as the UE/MS, and returns the derived key to the NAF. The
Ks_(ext/int)_NAF can then be used as the shared secret between the MS and the
NAF for any further security operations.
NOTE: If foreign agents (FA) are used, then foreign agent implements GAA NAF
to get the MN-FA key.
### 7.3.4 Use partial GBA to derive MN-HA Keys
NOTE: This subsection applies to MIPv4 and MIPv6.
GBA was designed for a situation where a UE wants to securely access
potentially many application servers (NAFs), while having to be authenticated
to the home network (and consume authentication vectors) in the Ub protocol
run only once. Furthermore, the NAFs the UE wants to access may and need not
be known at the time of the Ub protocol run. These requirements do not apply
to MIP bootstrapping: the number of MIP servers with which the UE needs to
share a key is limited to one, namely the Home AAA or Home Agent (when no
Foreign Agent is used), and two, when an FA is used (or three, when two FAs
are involved in a handover situation). In addition, the addresses of HA and FA
cannot be chosen by the UE any time later, but are assigned by the home
network (HA) and the visited network (FA), respectively. Therefore, the full
functionality of GBA may not be needed.
A disadvantage of the use of GBA for MIP bootstrapping is that the HA, and, if
applicable, the FA, need to support NAF functionality. An off-the-shelf HA or
FA does not do that.
Editor's note: the intention of this GBA extension is a subset of GBA and
should not be a problem.
We consider two cases below. For both cases, the following is assumed:
\- a UE has to run the Ub protocol with the BSF before starting MIP
registration.
\- the BSF is integrated with the AAA server (as in the current baseline
document).
\- the AAA server distributes keys to HA and FA using standard AAA procedures
(for MIPv4: RFC4004: DIAMETER Mobile IPv4 application, and for MIPv6: draft-
ietf-dime-mip6-split-03), and does not use the Zn interface.
\- the distributed keys are used with the Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6
authentication mechanisms defined in RFC 3344 and RFC 4285 respectively
Editor's note: it's FFS whether RADIUS extension also needs to be supported.
With these assumptions, HA and FA can be off-the-shelf, and need not be GBA-
aware. The Ua and the Zn interfaces are not needed.
Case 1: HA and FA addresses and/or names are acquired by the UE independently
of the Ub protocol run
In this case, the BSF and the UE derive keys Ks_(ext/int)_NAF to be shared
between UE and HA, and UE and FA, respectively, as specified in TS 33.220.
Editor's note: no change to Ub in Case 1.
Case 2: The HA address and/or name is acquired by the UE as part of the Ub
protocol run
In this case, the BSF can send the FQDN, and possibly also the IP address, of
the HA to the UE in a new element in the XML body of the \"200OK\" message,
which is the last message in the Ub protocol run. This provides an alternative
to SAE HA address assignment. Note that it may not be obvious for all access
systems how to let the UE acquire the SAE HA address.
Editor's note: the Ub interface will be affected in Case 2.
The FA address needs to be acquired by the UE locally.
The use of partial GBA for MIP bootstrapping is captured in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Partial GBA for MIP bootstrapping
### 7.3.5 Using IKEv2
Authentication between the MN and the network and IPsec SA setup between the
MN and the HA for MIPv6 shall be performed using IKEv2 as defined in the IETF
draft [draft-ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-split-02.txt]. In SAE, the home agent
communicates with the AAA server to perform mutual authentication. The IKEv2
authentication is performed using EAP-AKA.
Figure 6: MN-Network authentication and MN-HA IPsec SA setup for MIPv6
Editor's note 1: adding relatively heavy protocol of IKEv2 should be
considered to be for further study if cost efficiency is in appropriate level.
Editor's note 2: this is only one of multiple different options.
Editor's note 3: both I-WLAN scenarios 2 and 3 should be studied
(From S3-070820)
The first procedure that must be performed by the MN is the discovery of the
HA address, which in case of EPS is the IP address of the PDN GW.
As soon as the Mobile Node has discovered the PDN GW address, it establishes
an IPsec Security Association with the Home Agent itself through IKEv2. The
detailed description of this procedure is provided in RFC4877. The IKEv2
Mobile Node to Home Agent authentication is performed using Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP).
When the Mobile Node runs IKEv2 with its Home Agent, it shall request an IPv6
Home Address through the Configuration Payload in the IKE_AUTH exchange by
including an INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS attribute. When the Home Agent processes the
message, it allocates a HoA and sends it a CFG_REPLY message. The IPv6 Home
Address allocation through IKEv2 allows to bind the Home Address with the
IPsec security association so that the MN can only send Binding Updates for
its own Home Address and not for other MN's Home Addresses.
Figure 7 provides the flow for the initial DS-MIPv6 bootstrapping.
Figure 7: DS-MIPv6 bootstrapping based on IKEv2
1) The UE discovers the PDN GW address based on the procedure specified in
23.401.
2) The UE starts an IKEv2 exchange with the PDN GW. The first part of this
exchange is an IKE_SA_INIT exchange.
3) The UE indicates that EAP is used for IKEv2 authentication and an EAP
exchange is performed. EAP is carried over IKEv2 between the UE and the PDN GW
and over the AAA protocol between the PDN GW and the AAA server.
4) During the IKEv2 exchange, the PDN GW allocates an IPv6 Home Address and
send it to the UE in a IKEv2 Configuration Payload.
5) As a result of the previous steps, an IPsec SA is established to protect
DS-MIPv6 signalling.
6) The UE sends the MIP Binding Update message to the PDN GW.
7) The PDN GW processes the binding update. The PDN GW sends the MIP Binding
Ack to the UE.
8) As a result of the above steps a MIPv6 tunnel is established and the UE can
start using its home address at the application level.
### 7.3.6 Security bootstrapping for DS MIPv6 using MIP options
(From S3-070748)
This procedure uses the MIP authentication options defined in RFC4285 [8] to
provide authentication of Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement messages,
namely the
  * MN-HA Mobility Message Authentication Option and the
  * MN-AAA Mobility Message Authentication Option.
The AAA Mobility Message Authentication Option is used when the MN and the HA
do not yet have a shared key, i.e. in the situation requiring bootstrapping of
the MN-HA key.
It is assumed that the MN and the AAA server share a long-lived security
association.
NOTE: It is ffs whether there is a need to dynamically generate the MN-AAA key
and, if so, how to do it. Alternatives would include derivation during network
access authentication and GBA.
The MN-HA key is derived from the MN-AAA key and a nonce. The nonce is
requested by the MN in a Key Generation Nonce Request option and provided by
the AAA server to the MN in a Key Generation Nonce Reply option. These options
are described in draft-devarapalli-mip6-authprotocol-bootstrap [9].
NOTE: Instead of using a nonce for generating the MN-HA key from the MN-AAA
key, also the timestamp from the Mobility Message Replay Protection Option,
cf. below, could be used. This is ffs.
The HA may provide a Home Address to the MN using the Home Address Options
defined in draft-devarapalli-mip6-authprotocol-bootstrap [9].
The communication between the Home Agent and the AAA server is based on
DIAMETER extensions described in draft-ietf-dime-mip6-split [10]. This
communication is assumed to be authenticated (integrity-protected).
Figure 8: Bootstrapping using Mobile IP options
Description of the information flow in Figure 8:
  1. When the Mobile Node (MN) does not yet share a key with the Home Agent (HA) the MN sends a DSMIPv6 Binding Update (BU) including the MN-AAA authentication mobility option. The MN also includes a Key Generation Nonce Request Option. If the MN does not yet have a Home Address (HoA) it also includes the Home Address Request Option in the BU. The MN shall include the Mobility Message Replay Protection Option defined in RFC 4285 [8] containing a timestamp.
  2. When the Home Agent receives a BU with the MN-AAA mobility message authentication option, the HA forwards the BU to the AAA server for authentication.
  3. The AAA server authenticates the BU by verifying the message authentication code in the MN-AAA authentication mobility option, using the MN-AAA shared key and the timestamp in the Mobility Message Replay Protection Option.
  4. Upon successful authentication of the BU, the AAA server sends the parameters of the MN-HA security association (key, algorithm) to the HA. The AAA server also returns a nonce and algorithm identifier in the Key Generation Nonce Reply Option.
  5. The HA sends a Binding Acknowledge (BA) message protected with the MN-HA security association received from the AAA server to the MN. The HA forwards the Key Generation Nonce Reply Option as part of the BA. The HA also includes the Assigned Home Address Option in the BU if the MN requested a HoA. The HA checks the validity of the timestamp and, if necessary, includes an indication of a timestamp mismatch, as described in RFC 4285 [8]. In the latter case, HA deletes the MN-HA security association after sending the BA.
  6. The MN generates the MN-HA key from the MN-AAA key and the nonce. The MN then verifies the BA using the MN-HA authentication mobility option. If the BA contains an indication of a timestamp mismatch the MN resends the BU from step 1, but with the message authentication code in the MN-AAA authentication mobility option computed over the corrected timestamp.
  7. For subsequent BUs, the MN uses the established MN-HA security association and does not include an MN-AAA authentication mobility option.
## 7.4 Network based Mobility
### 7.4.1 PMIP
#### 7.4.1.1 Introduction
This section looks at how PMIP messages need to be protected within the
Evolved Packet Core and how PMIP protection needs to be handled if the PMIP
messages originate from a trusted non-3GPP network node.
This analysis is based on draft-ietf-netlmm-proxymip6-06.txt [11] from which
in particular the sections 4 and 11 have been used from a security viewpoint.
#### 7.4.1.2 Overview of PMIP usage in 3GPP
(From S3-070756)
PMIPv6 defines a MAG (Mobile Access Gateway) and an LMA (Local Mobility
Anchor) from which the LMA will be integrated in the PDN Gateway or Serving
Gateway (for the roaming case).
Figure 9: Protocols for MM control and user planes of S2a for the PMIPv6
option
TS 23.402v130 section 5 is relevant in this respect and specifies that PMIPv6
may be used on following reference points:
  * **S2a** : Between a node in the trusted non-3GPP access network (Foreign agent) and the LMA (Home Agent)
  * **S2b** : Between the ePDG and the LMA (Home Agent).
TS 23.402v130 section 4.2.1 mentions the use of PMIP based **S5** reference
point between the Serving Gateway and the PDN Gateway. The S5 reference point
may also apply GTP, and is an intra-operator interface. PMIP usage over S5/S8b
is currently included in the description of PMIP use over S2b, and (see
section 5.4.2.4.3 TS 23.402) in case of roaming, the S-GW is the LMA for PMIP
procedure in S2b between the ePDG and the S-GW and the PDN GW is the LMA for
PMIP procedure in S8b between the S-GW and the PDN GW. In addition, PMIP over
S5/S8b is discussed in section 5.4.2.6 TS 23.402 for E-UTRAN access.
#### 7.4.1.3 PMIP trust model
PMIPv6 is an IETF based network-based mobility management mechanism, and has
applied the same trust model properties as the use of GTP for mobility
management in UMTS and the EPC (for the S5 and S2b reference points). This
means the MAG i.e. the Serving Gateway (S5) or ePDG (S2b), is sufficiently
trusted by the LMA to register only those Mobile Nodes that are attached.
However when the MAG is located in a trusted non-3GPP network (S2a), there is
a little bit of a difference to the current 3GPP or PMIPv6 draft [11] trust
model where a 3GPP network component (SGSN, S-GW) is trusted to register only
attached MNs. Here, the MAG could e.g. be located in a WLAN AP which can much
more easily be tampered with than an SGSN or S-GW. The implication of this
scenario is for ffs (see also proposed decision at the end of this section).
**The trust between the LMA and the MAG is verified by the LMA by allowing
only those MAGs to perform Binding Updates which are known by the LMA i.e. by
the use of IKEv2 authentication. This measure defends against a Network Node
trying to impersonate another MAG, and thus will protect against Denial-Of-
Service attacks from the Mobile Node\'s viewpoint.**
**The PMIPv6 draft [11] recognizes the threat of a compromised MAG that would
send PMIP messages on behalf of a Mobile Node with a Mobile Node not present
on the local link. From section 11 of [PMIPv6 draft]:**
> \"To eliminate the threats related to a compromised mobile access gateway,
> this specification recommends that the local mobility anchor before
> accepting a Proxy Binding Update message for a given mobile node, should
> ensure the mobile node is definitively attached to the mobile access gateway
> that sent the binding registration request.
>
> The issues related to a compromised mobile access gateway in the scenario
> where the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway in different
> domains, is outside the scope of this document. _This scenario is beyond the
> applicability of this document._ \"
**The last sentence from the extract is an indication for the fact that the
S2a use is not covered by PMIPv6 draft [11] and needs additional
considerations.**
**Although required by PMIPv6 draft [11] it is unclear how the LMA should be
able to verify that the MN has attached, rather this seems to be a property of
the PMIP model that the MAG is trusted to apply those requirements. The
authorization mechanisms on the MAG-LMA interfaces are inadequate for this.**
**The effect of a potential misuse by the MAG could be limited to those MAGs
on which the Mobile Node is authorized to attach. This authorization shall
then be verified by the LMA. However, this explicit authorization-check may be
cumbersome to administrate per user (and therefore not very effective), and if
not administrated per user but per roaming partner, the authorization check
rather takes place between the MAG and the LMA (via the lack of shared secrets
for IKEv2, or certificate authorization checks), and this fits the PMIP trust
model applying to S5 and S2b.**
Extending PMIPv6 by involving the UE in order to produce a fresh user
involvement on the MAG that can be used towards the LMA, is a contradiction to
the design guidelines of PMIPv6: \"This protocol enables mobility support to a
host without requiring its participation in any mobility related signaling.\"
Furthermore verifying the user involvement would also increase the amount of
signaling needed. So there is a trade-off between trust/security and amount of
signaling.
NOTE 1: For the other network based mobility management protocols e.g. GTP
this has worked well in the past. The operator should be able to trace down
suspicious registrations as long as the links are secured (physical or by
NDS/IP).
In case of S5, the node implementing the MAG may already be trusted to receive
an EPS security context for a user, without proof of user involvement.
NOTE 2: In case S-GW and MME are implemented on the same physical node.
The risk caused by a misuse of the received key material is greater than the
risk due the use of the PMIPv6 trust model. Verifying user involvement during
mobility management registration would need to involve an additional
authentication verifiable by the LMA only such that the compromised MAG cannot
impersonate the user, where then we are back to the DSMIPv6 solution.
**Conclusion:**
> a) use PMIPv6 as defined by IETF [draft-ietf-netlmm-proxymip6-06.txt] for S5
> and S2b
>
> b) if the trust relation between the MAG and the LMA is not there then
> additional security measures are needed. These security measures are for
> ffs.
#### 7.4.1.4 Security measures on the Reference points between the LMA and the
MAG that have a trust relation
PMIPv6 draft [11] section 4 recommends the use of IPsec ESP in Transport Mode
(RFC4303) as default security mechanism for integrity protection and data
origin authentication for PMIP messages and IKEv2 end-to-end between the MAG
and the LMA to establish IPsec security associations. Confidentiality
protection of PMIP messages is not required.
Section 5.5.1 allows the use of one security tunnel between the MAG and the
LMA instead of a dynamic set-up.
> \"The bi-directional tunnel is established after accepting the ProxyBinding
> Update request message. The created tunnel may be shared with other mobile
> nodes attached to the same mobile access gateway and with the local mobility
> anchor having a Binding Cache entryfor those mobile nodes. Implementations
> MAY choose **to use static tunnels** instead of dynamically creating and
> tearing them down on a need basis.\"
Therefore alternatives to the IKEv2 usage like NDS/IP (TS 33.210) should still
be possible (RFC 2406 and IKEv1) and can provide the same security services.
The only difference is the hop-by-hop approach with SEGs (requiring tunnel
mode towards the SEG), which should not be a problem in viewpoint of security
if the network owning the SEG and the LMA is sufficiently trusted. The use of
TS 33.310 is needed when LMA and MAG belong to a different operator.
The PDN gateway may already implement IKEv1/IPsec for protecting the signaling
towards the AAA/HSS in case of DSMIPv6 and may already implement IKEv2 in case
that such mechanism would be selected for DSMIPv6 protection towards the
Mobile Node (which is for ffs at SA3#49). The ePDG already requires IKEv2
implementation towards the UE.
**Conclusion:**
> SA3#49 agreed that the choice between IKEv1 (as defined by NDS/IP) or IKEv2
> (as proposed by PMIPv2] for PMIP message protection between the MAG and the
> LMA needs further study
>
> a) Both IKEv2 and IKEv1 can provide the necessary security features.
>
> b) Referring to NDS/IP (TS 33.210) and NDS/AF (TS 33.310) allows a hop-by-
> hop security model.
>
> c) The difference between RFC2406 [which is referred by NDS/IP] and RFC4303
> [which is referred by PMIPV6] is not essential for the decision.
#### 7.4.1.5 The need for using strong access authentication with Proxy Mobile
IP
Clause 7.4.1.3 discusses the need for trust of the LMA in the correct
operation of the MAG. Trust in the MAG means that the LMA can be ensured that
the operation of MAG is not somehow influenced by an attacker. Clause 7.4.1.4
discusses the security on the reference point between the MAG and the LMA.
Security on this reference point ensures that PMIP messages are originating
from a trusted entity, and that no attacker could tamper with them in transit.
This subclause discusses an additional requirement for the secure operation of
PMIP: strong access authentication. In the context of PMIP, the authentication
scheme shall be considered sufficiently strong by all stakeholders involved,
in particular by the operators of MAG and LMA. In EPS the LMA is the PDN GW
owned by a 3GPP EPS operator. This implies that the authentication scheme
shall satisfy also 3GPP security requirements, i.e. it shall use a USIM.
PMIP is based on the assumption that a MAG can securely identify which user is
attached to the access network served by the MAG. This secure identification
is realised by access authentication. If access authentication was weak then
an attacker could impersonate a user in the access network. If this happened,
a MAG would report in good faith to the LMA that a certain user was present in
the access network, while in fact the attacker was present. This could result
in Denial of Service to the impersonated user through the use of PMIP because
all traffic destined to this user would then be routed to a wrong destination.
An impersonation attack exploiting a weakness in access authentication could
occur by attacking any part of the access network. Neither the trusted
operation of the MAG nor the security on the reference point between the MAG
and the LMA would prevent such an attack if access authentication was weak. In
this sense, the requirement of using strong access authentication with PMIP is
complementary to the requirements addressed in clauses 7.4.1.3 and 7.4.1.4.
Section 4 of TR 33.922 requires USIM-based authentication also for non-3GPP
access. Currently, AKA is the only authentication scheme known to use the
USIM. As AKA-based authentication is considered sufficiently strong, also the
requirement introduced in this subclause is considered fulfilled in EPS.
**Conclusion** :
> When PMIP is used within EPS, strong access authentication is required. In
> EPS and as per clause 4 of TR 33.922, this requirement is fulfilled since
> the USIM-based authentication for non-3GPP access is mandated. The USIM-
> based authentication implies the use of the AKA protocol, which is
> considered sufficiently strong.
#### 7.4.1.6 No trust relation between LMA and MAG on S2a
NOTEï¼šThis section describes the case when there is no trust relation between
the MAG and the LMA. However, what this section describes is not aligned with
the assumption of TS33.402v100 section 9.3.1.2.
##### 7.4.1.6.1 Security risks
MAG lies in the trusted non-3gpp IP access system in S2a. There may be no
trust relation between the MAG and the LMA since they may belong to different
operators. In this case, a compromised MAG may make an attack to UE in other
MAG's domain. Also, a compromised MAG may send fake PBU message to update the
binding of UE who is served by other MAG. In this case,
-the victim UE cannot receive the data since the data is routed to the compromised MAG;
-the compromised MAG can eavesdrop the data of UE who is served by other MAG;
-the compromised MAG may send a large amount of PBU to make the LMA in burden and a DoS attack may occur;
PMIPv6 [draft-ietf-netlmm-proxymip6-11] defines to use IPsec to protect
PBU/PBA. However, the prerequisite is that there should be trust relation
between the MAG and the LMA. PMIPv6 security mechanism cannot work for the
condition of no trust relation between the MAG and the LMA.
##### 7.4.1.6.2 Possible measures
One possible way is to have the mapping between the UE and the serving MAG in
one of network servers. When a MAG sends a PBU to a LMA, the LMA can ask this
server to check whether this MAG is currently serving the UE. In this way, it
will be avoided that a compromised MAG represents UE served by other MAGs to
send the fake PBU.
UE should run an EAP-AKA with MAG before PMIPv6 procedure. The AAA server in
UE's home network can record which MAG executed EAP-AKA procedure. In the
meanwhile, AAA can keep the mapping between UE and its serving MAG. In this
way, when a MAG sends a PBU message to a LMA, the LMA can ask the AAA server
to have a check whether this MAG is serving the UE in the current time
according to the identity of UE in PBU message. When UE moves to other MAG,
AAA should know the change since AAA will be involved in changing MAG's
procedure. So the AAA can update the mapping between UE and the serving MAG.
Editor's Note: Another solution is that AAA sends a key to MAG which is
related to the UE after EAP-AKA procedure. UE will participate in the EAP-AKA.
So the MAG can obtain this key only when this MAG really serves the UE. This
key can be used to protect the integrity of PBU messages. LMA interacts with
AAA to check the integrity of PBU message. In this way, a compromised MAG
cannot get the related key. So it can not send valid PBU message. When UE
moves to other MAG, AAA should know the change since AAA will be involved in
changing MAG's procedure. So the AAA can update the related key and send the
key to the current serving MAG. This solution may need clarify and FFS.
### 7.4.2 NetLMM
In Network based Localized Mobility Management (NetLMM) the Localized Mobility
Anchor (LMA) is configured with a globally routable network prefix which the
IP address assigned to UE is composed of, and packets to/from the UE are
tunnelled between LMA and Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs). MAG shares the same
network prefix as LMA's one, therefore, when the MN moves from one MAG to
another, neither the subnet nor the MN IP address are changing. Here the LMA
handles the packets incoming from Internet to the operator's domain. Each MAG
is configured with the information needed to contact the LMA. This is also
depicted in Figure 10.
Figure 10: Proxy mobility protocol scenario
NetLMM does not bring any additional security threats. The protocol does face
the general security threat of IP address ownership that is valid for all
mobility protocols. Solution for this threat is to:
\- Secure Link Layer attachment (Packet Data Protocol Context secured by 3G
AKA)
\- IP address allocation by the network over secured attachment.
For NetLMM the countermeasure regarding the security threats in Section 7.1
are:
\- IP address ownership
\- Enforce IP address ownership at network attachment. IP address is allocated
by network (e.g., DHCP, PDP) over secure network attachment (e.g., 3G AKA). IP
address binding is enforced during communication.
\- (D)DoS attack
\- Attack on forwarding resources
\- Requires knowledge of the network prefix allocated for MNs
\- Outside Correspondent Node and MNs are aware
\- Attack on control plane endpoint resources
\- Requires knowledge of the anchor point IP address
\- NetLMM LMA IP address is hidden from MNs and outside CNs.
\- NetLMM shall be resilient to DoS because only the forwarding resources can
be attacked. Those can be dealt with by over-provisioning the forwarding
capacity.
Editor's note: further details should be added.
# 8 Specific aspects of security for mobility between 3GPP access systems and
non-3GPP access systems
## 8.1 Security for mobility between pre-SAE 3GPP access systems and non-3GPP
access systems
It needs to be clarified in the course of the work on SAE mobility to what
extent mobility, and, in particular the related security aspects involving
pre-SAE 3GPP access systems require a different handling. The goal is, of
course, to minimise or completely avoid the differences, but it is currently
not clear in how far this goal can be achieved.
## 8.2 Security context transfer between 3GPP and trusted non-3GPP access
networks
Security context is the information on the current state of a UE in the
serving system required to re-establish the security association in the target
system. Security context includes
1\. Agreed security algorithms between the UE and the serving network,
2\. Agreed/derived encryption and/or integrity protection keys and key
identifiers.
3\. Security association related information like key lifetime, sequence
number, count values etc.
4\. The temporary identity issued by the serving network
NOTE: In 3GPP, temporary identity is used by the target network to identify
the serving network, but it's FFS for handover between 3GPP and non-3GPP
networks whether temp IDs to be used for identifying the pervious access
network.
As 3GPP has already adopted security context transfer procedures for
optimizing authentication during handover, it is reasonable for SAE to enable
security context transfer between the 3GPP and non-3GPP networks.
Editor's note: the content of security context is FFS.
## 8.3 ANDSF Security
### 8.3.1 General
ANDSF (Access Network Discovery and Selection Function) is a mechanism of
access network discovery and selection. It is provided in order to control the
UE\'s inter-system handover decisions and in order to reduce the battery
consumption for inter-system mobility. See TS23.402 for more details. However,
the privacy of UE and the operator needs to be protected if private
information will be sent between UE and ANDSF server. Reusing GBA and PSK TLS
to establish SA between UE and ANDSF server will be easily implemented by both
operators and vendors. PSK TLS can be used for the security association
between UE and ANDSF server. It can provide confidentiality and integrity
protection for ANDSF security.
### 8.3.2 Procedure
Figure 11: ANDSF security using GBA
1\. The UE and the BSF will process bootstrapping procedure. The master key Ks
will be derived in this procedure.
Editor's note: It is FFS if 3GPP AAA can be the BSF in this scenario to be
easily deployed by the operator.
2\. The UE discovers the ANDSF server. See more details in TS23.402. Then the
UE derives the Ks_ANDSF.
3\. The UE starts communication with ANDSF server. UE sends application
request to ANDSF server.
4\. ANDSF server sends authentication request to the BSF for the key,
5\. The BSF derives the Ks_ANDSF based the master key Ks. The derivation
function is the same with Ks_NAF. And then BSF sends Ks_ANDSF and the key
lifetime to the ANDSF server.
6\. ANDSF server will inform UE that it gets the key Ks_ANDSF and can continue
the ANDSF function,
7\. The UE and the ANDSF server establish the security association based on
the Ks_ANDSF. The detailed method i.e. PSK TLS, can be referenced to TS24.109.
Editor's note: It is FFS which method can also be used to establish the
security association between the UE and the ANDSF server.
8\. The UE and ANDSF server runs handover with ANDSF procedure after the SA
was successfully established to protect the communication between them.
