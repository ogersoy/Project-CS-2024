# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 42.068 and the following apply:
**group call anchor MSC:** the MSC responsible for managing and maintaining a
particular voice group call. The group call anchor MSC is determined as the
one controlling the cells of the group call area (see also group call relay
MSC). For a voice group call where the group call area exceeds one MSC area,
the group call anchor MSC is predefined in the network. In a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy, the group call anchor MSC redundancy
pool (instead of a group call anchor MSC) is predefined in a network for a
given voice group call.
**Group Call Attributes (GCA):** group call area, dispatcher identities, and
the non-activity time which results in the release of the voice group call by
the network
**group call relay MSC:** the MSC controlling cells of a group call area which
are not under control of the group call anchor MSC for those voice group call
services where the group call area exceeds one MSC area. For a voice group
call where the group area exceeds one MSC area, the address of the group call
relay MSC is pre-configured in the anchor MSC\'s GCR. In a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy this preconfigured address identifies
a group call relay MSC redundancy pool (instead of a group call relay MSC).
**Group Call Register (GCR):** functionality in the network containing the
group call attributes
**group call serving MSC:** In a RANflex configuration the group call serving
MSC of a location area is a group call anchor MSC or a group call relay MSC
that controls the group call signalling for this location area. A location
area within the pool area has a unique group call serving MSC, or - in a
RANflex configuration with group call redundancy \- a unique group call
serving MSC redundancy pool. For a given group call at any location, the group
call serving MSC is either the anchor MSC or one of the relay MSCs controlling
the group call. For a service subscriber located in this location area the
visited MSC may be different from the location area\'s group call serving MSC.
In a RANflex configuration all location areas within a BSC service area are
assigned to the same group call serving MSC.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy all location areas
within a BSC service area are assigned to the same group call serving MSC
redundancy pool.
**group call serving MSC redundancy pool:** A pool of group call serving MSCs
each of which can take the same role for a given group call (anchor /relay)
and serve the same location areas within a RANflex pool area with group call
services. For a given voice group call a location area\'s group call serving
MSC redundancy pool is either the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool or one
of the group call relay MSC redundancy pools.
**group call anchor MSC redundancy pool:** A group call serving MSC redundancy
pool. Each MSC within the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool can take the
role of the group call anchor MSC for a given group call. For a given instance
of a voice group call one group call anchor MSC is selected from the group
call anchor MSC redundancy pool.
**group call relay MSC redundancy pool:** A group call serving MSC redundancy
pool. Each MSC within the group call relay MSC redundancy pool can take the
role of the group call relay MSC for a given group call. For a given instance
of a voice group call one group call relay MSC is selected from every relevant
group call relay MSC redundancy pool.
**group members:** service subscribers entitled to belong to a particular
group classified by a certain group identification (group ID)
**group mode dedicated channel:** In this mode, a mobile station participating
in an ongoing voice group call is allocated at least two dedicated channels,
only one of them being a SACCH
**notification:** notifications are given on common control channels or
dedicated channels in order to inform group members which are either in idle
mode or in dedicated mode or participating in a voice group call or voice
broadcast call on the existence of voice group calls
**Notification CHannel (NCH):** common control channel on which the
notifications are sent by the network (equivalent to a paging channel)
**originator-to-dispatcher information:** information sent by the service
subscriber originating a voice group call to the network during call setup for
distribution to the dispatchers to be attached to the group call during call
setup
**RANflex configuration:** A network configuration that allows a location area
to be served by multiple MSCs in parallel. For details see 3GPP TS 23.236
[17]. In a RANflex configuration a given location area is associated with a
single group call serving MSC. There is no support of group call redundancy.
**RANflex configuration with group call redundancy** : A RANflex configuration
where a given location area is associated with a group call serving MSC
redundancy pool (instead of with a single group call serving MSC). For a given
voice group call a location area\'s group call serving MSC redundancy pool may
be a group call anchor MSC redundancy pool or a group call relay MSC
redundancy pool.
**voice group call channel:** combined uplink/downlink to be allocated in a
cell of the group call area for a particular voice group call\ The uplink can
be used by the presently talking service subscriber only. All mobile stations
of the listening service subscribers in one cell shall listen to the common
downlink.
**voice group call member:** any group member or dispatcher participating in
an on going voice group call
**point-to-point short message:** information that may be transferred between
a mobile station and a Service Center
**time-critical application-specific data:** application-specific data which
shall be transferred within the time limitation specified in 3GPP TS 42.068.
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TS 24.008 [7] apply.
**dedicated mode**
**group receive mode**
**group transmit mode**

# 4 Main concepts
## 4.1 Group definition
Service subscribers can become group members on a PLMN wide basis to one or
more groups pre-defined in the network by a corresponding group identification
(group ID). The membership enables them to initiate or receive voice group
calls associated with that group ID. Certain dispatchers connected to external
networks also require the capability to initiate or receive voice group calls.
A prefix can be used together with the group ID to define a subset of the
group members and to restrict the group of service subscribers able to receive
a voice group call to this subset.
In addition to subscriber details in the HLR, it is necessary for the mobile
station to be aware of its group membership by storing details on the
SIM/USIM. This is required because it shall respond to notification messages
which include only the group ID (i.e. no IMSI or TMSI details).
Having become a group member, each service subscriber can set to active state
or deactive state the group ID or any one out of his several group IDs on the
SIM/USIM. In active state the subscriber can initiate voice group calls to
that group. When in deactive state the subscriber can not make voice group
calls to the group and the mobile station ignores any notification for that
group.
If no NCH is defined in the cell, mobiles shall assume VGCS service is not
available on that cell.
## 4.2 Group conversations
### 4.2.1 Group call initiation
#### 4.2.1.1 Normal operation with successful outcome
A group call area can be restricted to a single MSC area or can exceed one MSC
area. In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy) a
group call area can be restricted to a single pool area or can exceed one pool
area.
A voice group call shall be initiated by a calling service subscriber by a
related input function, e.g. via MMI, specifying the selected service and the
group ID dialled or by a calling dispatcher by the MSISDN address (see
subclause 9.2). As an option, a calling service subscriber may add a prefix to
the group ID. As an option, the request of the calling service subscriber to
set up a voice group call may specify information to be sent as originator-to-
dispatcher information to the network; in this case the
originator‑to‑dispatcher information is included in the signalling for call
setup from the mobile station to the network. It is the responsibility of the
input function to ensure that the originator-to-dispatcher information has a
correct format (in particular, an allowed length).
As a further option, the request of the calling subscriber may indicate one of
the following talker priorities, listed in ascending order of talker priority:
\- normal subscriber;
\- privileged subscriber;
\- emergency subscriber.
A mobile station supporting the use of talker priorities shall check with the
SIM/USIM whether the subscriber is allowed to use the requested talker
priority for the respective group ID before signalling the talker priority to
the network.
On reception of a VGCS setup request with a talker priority different from
\"normal subscriber\", the MSC shall check with the VLR whether the subscriber
has a subscription to use this talker priority. If the subscriber is not
allowed to use the requested talker priority, the MSC shall reduce the talker
priority to a value the subscriber is allowed to use. In any case the talker
priority used by the MSC shall be signalled back to the calling service
subscriber in the Connect message.
If a VGCS setup request with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\" is
received by the network and the subscription check is successful, the network
shall set the emergency mode for this voice group call. The emergency mode may
be reset during the voice group call (see subclause 4.2.2.1).
If a prefix is added to the group ID, the MSC shall ignore the prefix when
performing the subscription check.
The MSC in which a voice group call is initiated obtains the group call
attributes by requesting the Group Call Register (GCR, see clause 5). Without
a RANflex configuration or in a RANflex configuration (with or without group
call redundancy), if visited MSC and group call serving MSC are identical, the
MSC performs a local GCR interrogation.
The local GCR interrogation after call initiation also determines whether the
MSC shall act as anchor or as relay MSC. If the MSC is not the anchor MSC then
the call will be \"forwarded\" from the relay to the respective anchor MSC
(information also delivered by GCR) and further \"call-establishment\" is done
by the anchor MSC as described in the following.
In a RANflex configuration the VMSC in which a voice group call is initiated
may be different from the group call serving MSC of the voice group call
initiating subscriber\'s location area. In this case the VMSC derives the
identity of the group call serving MSC from the initiating subscriber\'s LAC
and requests the group call anchor MSC address from the group call serving MSC
by means of the SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO MAP service. The call is then
\"forwarded\" from the VMSC to the anchor MSC and further \"call-
establishment\" is done by the anchor MSC as described in the following.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy the VMSC in which a
voice group call is initiated may not belong to the group call serving MSC
redundancy pool of the voice group call initiating subscriber\'s location
area. In this case the VMSC derives the identity of the group call serving MSC
redundancy pool from the initiating subscriber\'s LAC and requests the group
call anchor MSC redundancy pool address from the group call serving MSC by
means of the SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO MAP service. The call is then \"forwarded\"
from the VMSC to the anchor MSC redundancy pool and further \"call-
establishment\" is done by the selected anchor MSC as described in the
following.
When a calling service subscriber or calling dispatcher initiates a voice
group call, one voice group call channel shall be established in each cell of
the group call area and notifications for that call shall be sent in each of
these cells. As an alternative, voice group call channels may only be
established in cells in reaction to responses received from mobile stations on
the notifications using notification response procedure. At the same time
standard connections to dispatchers in the mobile network or in an external
network shall be established. If originator-to-dispatcher information has been
received in the signalling for call setup from the mobile station to the
network and if the originating MSC supports processing of
originator‑to‑dispatcher information, this information is transformed into
user-to-user information and sent to the dispatchers as UUS1 when setting up
the standard connections.
A voice group call channel shall consist of a combined uplink/downlink. The
uplink will be used exclusively by the presently talking service subscriber.
All mobile stations of the listening service subscribers in one cell shall
only listen to the same common downlink.
During call establishment there are different options for the network to
allocate a speech channel for the calling service subscriber:
In the first option, the calling service subscriber shall have its dedicated
standard connection during call establishment and for the first period when he
will be the talking service subscriber up to the time when the network decides
that he shall join the voice group call channel. The mobile station of the
calling service subscriber shall then go to the voice group call channel and
the dedicated standard connection shall be released.
In the second option, the network shall allocate a dedicated signalling
channel (e.g. SDCCH) to be used by the mobile station up to the time when the
voice group call channel in the originating cell is established and the
network decides that the mobile station shall join the voice group call
channel.
Only one voice group call channel shall be established in each cell for any
given voice group call, although there may be a number of simultaneous voice
group calls within the same cell.
Destination service subscribers shall be notified on the voice group call in
each cell. These voice group call notification messages shall be broadcast on
the Notification CHannel (NCH).
The notification messages use the group ID rather than individual TMSIs/IMSIs.
If the length of the group ID is less than 8 decimal digits , then the group
call area ID is used in order to enable a resolution in the case of
overlapping group call areas. A service subscriber\'s mobile station needs to
be able to recognise notification messages for those group IDs subscribed to
and presently activated. If the mobile station supports the use of prefixes
with group IDs and has stored prefixes for a group ID, it shall take these
prefixes into account following detection of a match of the group ID.
The network may also send messages on appropriate voice group call channel
FACCHs, in order to notify group call members who may participate in other
voice group calls. In addition, also paging information messages for standard
calls may be sent in order to inform group call members on actually paged
point-to-point calls.
Further the network may provide notification on the voice group call to
service subscribers who have subscribed to the paged group ID and which are in
dedicated mode. The process of broadcasting messages on NCHs is to be carried
out throughout the call in order to provide the \"late entry\" facility
whereby group members entering the area can join the call.
If the emergency mode is set for a voice group call, the network shall include
an emergency mode indication in the voice group call notification messages
sent on the NCH, the group call channel FACCHs of all other ongoing voice
group calls, voice broadcast calls, and the FACCHs associated with dedicated
channels.
On receiving notification of a voice group call a group call member\'s mobile
station shall adjust to the nominated channel to receive the voice group call
if this channel was described in the notification message and receive the
information on the downlink. Whilst receiving, the mobile station shall not
transmit on the uplink SACCH. This group receive mode is different to the
normal idle mode or dedicated mode. If no channel description was provided in
the notification message, the mobile station shall establish a dedicated
connection by use of the notification response procedure in order to respond
to the notification. The network may then provide the mobile station with a
channel description for the voice group call.
As a further mobile station option, the mobile station may read its paging
subchannel in the current cell while in group receive mode or in group
transmit mode in order to receive paging messages for mobile terminated calls.
#### 4.2.1.2 Exceptional procedures
Completion of links into congested cells where pre-emption did not occur is
required.
On receiving details of a voice group call the user may choose to move to the
notified call or the mobile station may automatically move to the notified
call if the new call is of higher priority than the existing call and
automatic acceptance applies for this priority level.
### 4.2.2 On-going group calls
#### 4.2.2.1 Normal operation with successful outcome
Within each voice group call starting from the instant where the calling
service subscriber first becomes a listening service subscriber, one service
subscriber has the access at any one time to the uplink of the voice group
call channel and his speech is then broadcast on all voice group call channel
downlinks accordingly. The mobile station of the talking service subscriber
who uses the uplink of the voice group call channel can be commanded by the
network to mute or unmute the downlink of the voice group channel when needed.
The mobile station is commanded:
  * to mute the downlink in order to avoid non intelligible echoes (in this case, the talking service subscriber can not hear dispatcher\'s voice); and
> \- to unmute the downlink in order to hear dispatcher\'s voice .
Either DTMF or the signalling option specified in ETSI TS 103 389 [19] shall
be used by dispatchers to trigger network signalling to mute and un-mute the
downlink of a talking service subscriber as described in subclause 11.3.7.2.
If more than one service subscriber applies for the uplink, contention
resolution shall be performed in the network. Contention resolution shall be
performed in the group call anchor MSC.
Additionally, in order to speed up the uplink access procedure, the BSS may
grant the uplink prior to contention resolution being performed by the group
call anchor MSC. This would mean that more than one service subscriber may
access to the uplink and the respective speech may be combined in the group
call bridge and broadcast onto all voice group call downlink channels during a
transitional period. The anchor MSC shall then select one of the talking
subscribers and pre-empt the uplink use of the other talking subscribers.
Dispatchers' voice involved shall be broadcast on the voice group call channel
downlink at any time. Mobile dispatchers are provided with a standard link and
thus with a dedicated permanent uplink different from the voice group call
channel.
All non-dispatcher group call members are provided with an indication on the
voice group call channel of whether the uplink is in use. If a network
supports the use of talker priorities, it shall indicate the talker priority
of the current talking service subscriber together with this uplink busy
indication, and repeat the uplink busy indication periodically. When the
uplink is not in use, any non-dispatcher group call member can request access
to the uplink. Any speech from dispatchers is combined with any speech from a
talking service subscriber.
The talker priorities specified in subclause 4.2.1.1 can be included by the
mobile station in the uplink access message or priority uplink request message
and used by the network to prioritize between different uplink requests or
between an uplink request and the priority of the current talker. A mobile
station shall not include a talker priority different from \"normal
subscriber\" in the uplink access message and shall not send a priority uplink
request message, if the network has indicated in the uplink busy message that
talker priorities are not supported.
An uplink request with talker priority \"normal subscriber\" is signalled as
an uplink request without talker priority.
If a subscriber requests for the uplink while the uplink is in use, a mobile
station supporting the use of talker priorities shall signal the request to
the network only if:
\- the subscriber is allowed to use the requested talker priority for the
respective group ID;
\- the network supports the use of talker priorities. The mobile station shall
assume that the network supports talker priorities, until the mobile station
receives an uplink busy indication containing no talker priority information;
and
\- the requested talker priority is higher than the talker priority of the
current talking service subscriber. The mobile station shall consider the
talker priority of the current talking service subscriber to be \"normal
subscriber\", until it receives an uplink busy indication indicating the
actual talker priority.
If the BSS receives an uplink access message with a talker priority different
from \"normal subscriber\", a BSS supporting the use of talker priorities
shall delay the sending of the uplink request message to the MSC, until the MS
identity, IMSI or TMSI, is received from the MS with the subsequent layer 3
message talker indication. The BSS shall then include in the uplink request
message the layer 3 message, the requested talker priority, and the cell
identity of the cell where the uplink access message was received.
If the BSS receives a layer 3 message priority uplink request, it shall
include the MS identity received from the MS in the uplink request message.
The BSS shall also include, in the uplink request message, the requested
talker priority and the cell identity of the cell where the priority uplink
request message was received.
The BSS shall send the uplink request message to the MSC only if the uplink is
free or if the talker priority included in the uplink access is higher than
the talker priority of the current talking service subscriber. If the layer 3
message is transmitted in the uplink request message, the BSS may omit the
sending of the uplink request confirm message.
In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy), if the
group call serving MSC receives an uplink request message it shall check by
analysing the NRI of the requesting subscriber\'s TMSI whether it is the
requesting subscriber\'s VMSC. If it is not, the group call serving MSC shall
retrieve the IMSI and information about subscribed talker priorities from the
VLR of the VMSC by means of the MAP service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO. During this
MAP operation the VMSC shall check the subscription for the group ID.
In any configuration, if the MSC receives a talker request with a talker
priority different from \"normal subscriber\" from the BSS, the MSC shall
check whether the subscriber has a subscription to use this priority:
\- if the subscriber is allowed to use the requested priority, the network
shall disconnect the uplink allocated to the current talking service
subscriber and assign the uplink to the requesting service subscriber;
\- otherwise, the network shall reject the uplink request with cause value
\"requested option not authorized\".
If a talker request with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\" is received
from a subscriber who has a subscription to use this priority, the network
shall additionally set the emergency mode and signal the emergency mode
indication
  * to the listeners of the group call, and
  * to the other group members in the group call area with the group ID active, regardless whether they are in idle mode or dedicated mode, or participate in a different group call,
until the emergency mode is reset by a subscriber with a specific subscription
to do this. If the uplink is busy then the indication to the listeners shall
be given periodically every T1 seconds. The emergency mode indication has no
influence on the talker priority handling.
If a subscriber requests to reset of the emergency mode, a mobile station
supporting the use of talker priorities shall send an uplink access message or
priority uplink request message indicating \"emergency mode reset request\"
only if
  * the subscriber has a subscription for this request for the > respective group ID; and
  * the network indicates that the emergency mode is set.
If the BSS receives an uplink access message with an \"emergency mode reset
request\", a BSS supporting the use of talker priorities shall wait until the
MS provides the MS identity, IMSI or TMSI, with the subsequent layer 3 message
talker indication. Then the BSS shall send an emergency reset indication to
the MSC including the layer 3 message and the cell identity of the cell where
the uplink access message was received.
If the BSS receives a layer 3 message priority uplink request, it shall
include the MS identity received from the MS in the emergency reset
indication. The BSS shall also include, in the emergency reset indication
message, the cell identity of the cell where the priority uplink request
message was received.
If the MSC receives an emergency reset indication from the BSS, the MSC shall
check whether the subscriber has a subscription for this request. If so, the
network shall:
\- stop sending the emergency mode indication; and
\- set the talker priority to \"normal subscriber\", if the uplink status is
uplink busy with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\".
If the subscriber has no subscription for the request or if the emergency mode
is not set, then the MSC shall discard the request.
The receipt of an \"emergency mode reset request\" does not trigger a talker
change.
If more than one service subscriber applies for the uplink, the one with the
highest talker priority shall be accepted. An uplink access message or
priority uplink request message with an \"emergency mode reset request\" shall
be treated with higher priority than any uplink request with talker priority
\"normal subscriber\", \"privileged subscriber\" or \"emergency subscriber\".
If several requests with the same highest priority are received, contention
resolution between these requests shall be performed in the network. For the
ranking of uplink access messages by the BSC, if the network additionally
supports the transfer of time-critical application-specific data, see
subclause 4.2.8.2.2 a.
Contention resolution shall be performed by the BSC, relay MSC or anchor MSC
which is the first to detect that more than one request with the same highest
priority was received. An MSC performing contention resolution shall select
the service subscriber whose request was received first by the MSC and pre-
empt the uplink use of the other service subscribers. For contention
resolution performed by the BSC see subclause 11.3.7.1.
Mobile stations shall support the reception of additional information related
to the current talking service subscriber. The transmission of additional
information is optional for the network. If additional information is
provided, then it is periodically repeated by the network as long as the
current talking service subscriber keeps the uplink. The additional
information consists of a string of up to 17 octets and is stored in the HLR
as part of the subscription data of the subscriber. The contents and the
encoding of the additional information is operator specific.
The release of the uplink is triggered by the user and indicated by the mobile
station to the network. The network shall then indicate to the listening
mobile stations that the uplink is free.
Mobile stations in group receive mode use the group receive mode procedure
(see 3GPP TS 43.022) to \"camp-on\" in a new cell to be able to listen to the
group call channel. The mobile station may find the voice group call channel
details of a new cell on the related NCH.
A network may decide not to establish voice group call channels in all cells.
Instead, notifications containing no channel description may be provided. If a
mobile station moves to such a cell, it must establish a dedicated connection
and respond to the notification by use of the notification response procedure
in order to receive the voice group call. The network may then establish a
voice group call channel and inform the mobile station on the channel
position.
If the uplink reply procedure is applicable for the voice group call, the
network may obtain knowledge on whether mobile stations are listening in a
cell by sending an uplink access request (perform uplink reply procedure) in
an uplink free message on the voice group call channel downlink when no
talking service subscriber is present in the cell. Mobile stations receiving
such a request shall use uplink reply procedure and send uplink access bursts
on the voice group call channel uplink with the establishment cause \"reply on
uplink access request\". If no uplink access bursts are received by the
network, the network may decide to release the voice group call channel in
that cell and then provide notifications containing no channel description.
NOTE: Concerning security aspects, whilst authentication and membership
checking of mobile call originators and of mobile uplink users can be carried
out, it is not possible to authenticate service subscribers in group receive
mode if they have not before established a dedicated connection to respond to
a notification. No equivalent of a group \"TMSI\" is provided to protect the
\"identity\" of established voice group calls.
The network may decide to reconfigure an existing voice group call's physical
channel configuration, frequencies and/or hopping sequences as well as the
cell channel description. For the cell in which the group call is being
reconfigured, the network informs any listeners in group receive mode and any
talker in group transmit mode of the change in VGCS channel description by
using the VGCS reconfiguration procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [5]). Mobile
stations on receipt of the VBS/VGCS reconfiguration messages shall remain on
the existing group channel until indicated starting time and then apply the
new configuration to the VGCS call that the mobile station is currently
involved in.
#### 4.2.2.2 Exceptional procedures
When a talking subscriber\'s mobile station loses contact with the network,
the network must detect this loss and set the uplink free so that other mobile
stations may access the uplink. The talking subscriber\'s mobile station which
has lost the contact with the network shall return immediately to the group
receive mode.
If a mobile station in group receive mode indicates a failure due to radio
link time-out, the mobile station shall behave as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008
and go back to idle mode, possibly in another cell, as determined by the cell
re-selection algorithm. If a notification is received for the same call, the
mobile station shall try to reconnect.
### 4.2.3 Leaving of a group call without termination
A service subscriber can leave the voice group call at any point by
\"deselecting\" it via an MMI function. Having deselected the voice group call
the mobile station returns to idle mode and \"ignores\" any further
notification messages related to that voice group call.
NOTE: If a service subscriber does not wish to participate in calls to a
particular group ID for long periods of time, the group ID shall be switched
to deactive state by the subscriber.
The service subscriber shall have the capability to reselect the voice group
call. The mobile station shall not ignore notification messages to that call
any more.
The dispatcher shall be able to leave a voice group call without terminating
it.
### 4.2.4 Group call termination
A voice group call can only be terminated by the calling service subscriber,
by calling dispatcher, by an entitled dispatcher or due to no activity timer
expiry (see subclauses 8.1.2.3 and 11.3.2.3).
The calling service subscriber can terminate the call only if he has access to
the uplink. He shall remain the calling service subscriber during the length
of the particular voice group call even if he leaves the call and then returns
to it later.
An entitled dispatcher can terminate the call at any time by using a network-
defined user operation (via DTMF or the signalling option specified in ETSI TS
103 389 [19]).
### 4.2.5 Acknowledgements
The acknowledgement is an application option.
For voice group calls which are identified by an acknowledgement flag mobile
stations which have acknowledgement facilities have to return an
acknowledgement message with a predefined content in a predefined manner.
The acknowledgement shall be sent using an appropriate data service, to a
predefined address or with a predefined short code stored on the SIM/USIM
card. The network may apply geographical routing to a predefined
acknowledgement service centre.
### 4.2.6 Transactions between the mobile station and the network
Mobile stations which are in group receive mode may support the reception of
short messages to voice group calls, but shall not perform any other
transactions with the network while adjusted to the voice group call channel.
They shall leave the group receive mode and act in a standard way to perform
any transaction if necessary and return to the voice group call afterwards.
Mobile stations which have access to the voice group call channel uplink shall
not perform any transactions for supplementary services, but may support the
transmission and reception of short messages as specified in subclause 11.3.9.
[Other features such as DTMF are under discussion. FFS].
### 4.2.7 Processing of originator-to-dispatcher information
The calling service subscriber may include originator-to-dispatcher
information during call setup. If the originating MSC supports processing of
originator-to-dispatcher information, it transforms the received originator-
to-dispatcher information into UUS1, and sends it:
\- if the originating MSC is not the voice group call anchor MSC: to the voice
group call anchor MSC;
\- if the originating MSC is the voice group call anchor MSC: to the
dispatchers to be attached to the group call during call setup of the
connections to these dispatchers.
The anchor MSC receiving UUS1 in a voice group call setup from an originating
relay MSC forwards this UUS1 to the dispatchers to be attached to the group
call during call setup of the connections to these dispatchers.
**Transformation of originator-to-dispatcher information:** Originator-to-
dispatcher information can be compressed or uncompressed.
\- Decompression of compressed originator-to-dispatcher information is
specified in 3GPP TS 44.068.
\- The transformation of uncompressed originator-to-dispatcher information
into UUS1 is the UUS1 containing the same user-user IE as the originator-to-
dispatcher information.
\- The transformation of compressed originator-to-dispatcher information into
UUS1 is the UUS1 resulting from transforming the decompressed originator-to-
dispatcher information into UUS1.
### 4.2.8 Transfer of application-specific data to group call members
#### 4.2.8.1 General
Mobile stations may support the transmission of application-specific data to
other group call members or VGCS applications in the network, and the
reception of application-specific data from other group call members or VGCS
applications in the network during an ongoing voice group call, in parallel to
the voice conversation.
Service subscribers can request the transmission of application-specific data
while they are talker or listener.
Editor\'s note: The transmission and reception of application-specific data by
dispatchers is ffs.
A mobile station supporting the transmission of application-specific data
shall check with the USIM whether the subscriber is allowed to transmit
application-specific data for the respective group ID before starting the
signalling procedures specified in subsclause 4.2.8.
The procedure specified in the following subclauses supports the transfer of
application-specific data.
The same procedure can also be used by the receiver of application-specific
data to confirm the reception of application-specific data.
NOTE: For the exact upper limit of application-specific data that can be sent
in a single transmission see 3GPP TS 44.018 [5]. The upper limit will be
chosen so that the application-specific data together with the necessary
control information fit into a single SABM frame.
The support of the transfer of application-specific data by the network is an
operator option.
The exact format of the application-specific data is out of scope of the 3GPP
specifications. If roaming service subscribers from other PLMNs are to be the
supported or if a group call area includes cells from more than one PLMN, the
use of application-specific data requires coordination between the operators.
#### 4.2.8.2 Sending of application-specific data
##### 4.2.8.2.1 By the talking service subscriber
When application-specific data is to be sent and the talking subscriber is
allowed to transmit application-specific data for the respective group ID, the
mobile station of the talking service subscriber shall send a **DATA
INDICATION** (Application_Data) message to the network on the uplink of the
dedicated channel or group call channel. On receipt of the application-
specific data, the network shall transmit these data to the other group call
members as specified in subclause 4.2.8.4.
NOTE: If the talker has to release the uplink before sending application-
specific data, the MS follows the procedures specified in subclause 4.2.8.2.2.
##### 4.2.8.2.2 By a listener
When application-specific data is to be sent and the network indicates the
uplink as free, the listener shall use the group call channel uplink for the
signalling as specified in item a) below.
Otherwise, when the network does not indicate the uplink as free, the channel
to be used by the listener is indicated by the network in the \"uplink access
indication\" IE sent in periodic transmissions of the UPLINK BUSY message. If
the talking service subscriber uses the group call channel uplink in the
current cell, the RACH shall be used, see item b) below; otherwise the group
call channel uplink shall be used, see item a) below.
**a) Sending application-specific data via the group call channel uplink**
When application-specific data is to be sent and the listener is allowed to
transmit application-specific data for the respective group ID, the mobile
station of the listener shall send an UPLINK ACCESS message with an
appropriate establishment cause (\"UL request for sending application-specific
data\") on the group call channel uplink to the BSS.
It is an operator option whether the BSS treats an UPLINK ACCESS message with
establishment cause \"UL request for sending application-specific data\" with
higher or lower priority than UPLINK ACCESS messages with any other
establishment cause. The same order of priorities applies to all voice group
calls in a network.If the BSS grants the uplink of the group call channel,
then the MS sends a SABM (DATA INDICATION) message with its mobile identity
and the application data to the network. The serving BSS responds with a UA
(DATA INDICATION) message and releases the group call channel uplink. The MS
returns to group receive mode.
On receipt of the DATA INDICATION message, the BSC shall add the cell
identifier of the cell where the application data were sent from and passes
the L3 information by sending the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message to the MSC.
On receipt the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message, the MSC shall distribute the
data to all members of the group call (see subclause 4.2.8.4).
NOTE 1: Procedure a) is used to achieve the transfer time target for time-
critical data. If all MSCs and BSCs involved in the voice group call support
the feature \"talker channel parameter\", the \"talker channel parameter\" can
be used to ensure that the voice group call channel uplink is available for
the uplink access and the transmission of time-critical application-specific
data.
NOTE 2: In a network that is intended to support the transfer of time-critical
data, the BSS will usually be configured to treat an uplink request for
sending application-specific data with higher priority than any other uplink
requests.
**b) Sending application-specific data via the RACH**
When application-specific data is to be sent and the listener is allowed to
transmit application-specific data for the respective group ID, the mobile
station of the listener shall leave the group call and send a CHANNEL REQUEST
message with an appropriate establishment cause on the RACH to the BSS in
order to request an SDCCH. When a new layer 2 connection is established on a
SDCCH channel the data can be sent by the mobile station to the network with
the **DATA INDICATION 2** message on the main DCCH (figure 7j).
In order to indicate to the network which group call the application-specific
data is addressed to, the **DATA INDICATION 2** message shall include the
group call reference.
On receipt of the DATA INDICATION 2 message the BSC shall add the cell
identifier of the cell from which the application data was sent and pass the
L3 information in the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message to the MSC.
On receipt of the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message, the MSC shall distribute
the data to all members of the group call (see subclause 4.2.8.4).
#### 4.2.8.3 Sending a confirmation of receipt of application-specific data
On receiving application-specific data, any service subscriber can send a
confirmation to the network which will send the confirmation to the ongoing
group call.
For the purpose of identifying the received data, the confirmation shall
include the data_id which was received in the message that contained the
application data that is being confirmed.
The further proceeding is as described in 4.2.8.2.1 and 4.2.8.2.2 (see also
figure 7i).
#### 4.2.8.4 Distributing application-specific data to a voice group call
##### 4.2.8.4.1 Distribution via the MSC
On receipt of the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA, the MSC shall check if the sending
subscriber has a subscription to the group ID. If yes, the MSC shall
distribute the application-specific data dependent on the distribution
parameter included in the DATA INDICATION or DATA INDICATION 2 message;
otherwise the MSC shall discard the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message.
Without a RANflex configuration, the MSC can perform this check locally with
its own VLR. In a RANflex configuration with or without group call redundancy,
if the group call serving MSC receives an UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message it
shall check by analysing the NRI of the requesting subscriber\'s TMSI whether
it is the requesting subscriber\'s VMSC. If it is not, the group call serving
MSC shall retrieve the IMSI and information about subscribed talker priorities
from the VLR of the VMSC by means of the MAP service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
During this MAP operation the VMSC shall check the subscription for the group
ID.
If the application-specific data are to be sent to the listeners and the
talking service subscriber, the MSC shall proceed as follows:
If the MSC is the anchor MSC, it shall put the application data and optionally
the mobile subscriber\'s MSISDN into the BSSMAP message NOTIFICATION DATA and
distribute the message towards all relay MSCs and all BSSs in its MSC area
involved in the group call (figure 7f). If the MSC receives an indication from
the originating BSC that the application-specific data were immediately
distributed to the originating BSS area (see subclause 4.2.8.4.2), the **MSC
shall not send the** BSSMAP message NOTIFICATION DATA **to the originating
BSS.**
If the MSC is a relay MSC, it shall put the application data and optionally
the mobile subscriber\'s MSISDN into the BSSMAP message NOTIFICATION DATA and
distribute the message to the anchor MSC and all BSSs of the relay MSC area.
If the MSC receives an indication from the originating BSC that the
application-specific data were immediately distributed to the originating BSS
area (see subclause 4.2.8.4.2), the **MSC shall not send the** BSSMAP message
NOTIFICATION DATA **to the originating BSS.** On receiving the NOTIFICATION
DATA message from the relay MSC, the anchor MSC shall send the message towards
all BSSs in its MSC area involved in the group call and to all relay MSCs
except the relay MSC from which the NOTIFICATION DATA was received (figure
7h). The BSS shall broadcast the notification data to all listeners and
talking service subscriber in the NOTIFICATION APPLICATION DATA message on the
FACCH.
The network may repeat the NOTIFY APPLICATION DATA message for application-
specific data on the group call channel downlink. If a mobile station receives
the NOTIFY APPLICATION DATA message more than once, it shall deliver only the
first received message to its local application and discard any received
repetitions of the message.
The mechanism how the mobile station detects a repetition of the NOTIFY
APPLICATION DATA message is application- specific.
Editor\'s note: The sending of application-specific data to other destinations
(e.g. dispatchers or applications) is ffs.
##### 4.2.8.4.2 Immediate distribution by the BSC
As a network option, on receipt of application-specific data from the MS, the
BSS may distribute the application-specific data immediately to the cells
within the BSC area belonging to the group call area, if the **distribution
parameter included in the DATA INDICATION message or DATA INDICATION 2 message
indicates that the application-specific data are to be sent to the service
subscribers**. **In addition, the BSC shall send the application-specific data
to the MSC with an indication that the application-specific data were already
distributed to the originating BSC area.**
When this network option is used, the BSS cannot include the mobile
subscriber\'s MSISDN in the NOTIFY APPLICATION DATA message broadcast
immediately to the cells within the BSC area. Furthermore, the BSS cannot
check if the sending subscriber has a subscription for the group ID.
If the network option of immediate distribution of application-specific data
by the BSS is activated, then during the establishment phase of the voice
group call the BSC shall **store the** cell identities of the cells belonging
to the group call area and served by the BSC.
NOTE: If this option is activated no subscription check by the MSC is
possible. It is also not possible to include the mobile subscriber\'s MSISDN
in the NOTIFY APPLICATION DATA message.
# 5 General architecture
## 5.1 Group Call Register (GCR)
The general architecture of GSM is maintained. In addition, a network function
is required which is used for registration of the group call attributes, the
Group Call Register (GCR).
The GCR function is mainly a database function, holding information about
voice group calls.
NOTE 1: The GCR implementation is not specified. It may be realized e.g. as a
new network node, in a PABX directly attached to an MSC, inside an MSC or as
an HLR. The interface between the GCR function and other functions is not
specified in the GSM technical specifications. As a consequence, the
functional split between MSC and GCR as developed in the present document is
only indicative, and other functional splits can be implemented.
The GCR data for a specific voice group call is set at the creation of the
group call attributes, and can be subsequently modified. No support for these
functions is specified in the GSM technical specifications.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy GCRs associated to MSCs
belonging to the same redundancy pool need to communicate with each other by
means of SYNC_GCR messages.
Figure 1: Functional architecture with a Group Call Register
Note: Figure 1a shows the configuration with only one RANflex MSC pool. Other
configurations with more than one RANflex MSC pool are possible.
Figure 1a: Functional architecture with a Group Call Register in a RANflex
configuration
Note: Figure 1b shows the configuration with only one RANflex MSC pool. Other
configurations with more than one RANflex MSC pool are possible.
Figure 1b: Functional architecture with a Group Call Register in a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy
Dashed lines in figure 1, figure 1a and figure 1b indicate MAP interfaces,
thin solid lines indicate ISUP interfaces, bold solid lines indicate
interfaces without standardized protocol.
Lines in figure 1b ending at an MSC Redundancy Pool actually connect to the
selected MSC within the redundancy pool. For MSC selection see subclause
5.3.1.
The signalling between the entities shown in figure 1, figure 1a and figure
1b, for the two cases of service subscriber and dispatcher originated calls,
shall be as defined in the following.
**Service subscriber originated:** The service subscriber\'s VMSC shall
perform subscription checking against VLR records. In a RANflex configuration
it shall then derive from the service subscriber\'s current location area the
address of the group call serving MSC which may be different from the VMSC. In
a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy this address identifies a
group call serving MSC redundancy pool.
If one of the following configurations applies:
a) no RANflex configuration;
b) in a RANflex configuration, if the VMSC is the group call serving MSC; or
c) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the VMSC belongs
to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool,
the VMSC shall consult its GCR to determine the group call attributes related
to its MSC area and whether it is the group call anchor MSC for that voice
group call. If it is not, the GCR shall provide with the group call attributes
the routing information identifying the group call anchor MSC (the group call
anchor MSC redundancy pool in a RANflex configuration with group call
redundancy) to the originating VMSC. The originating VMSC shall then route the
voice group call to the anchor MSC.
If one of the following configurations applies:
d) in a RANflex configuration, if the VMSC is not the group call serving MSC;
or
e) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the VMSC does not
belong to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool,
the VMSC shall consult the group call serving MSC by means of the MAP service
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO and retrieve the group call anchor MSC address. The
originating VMSC shall then route the voice group call to the anchor MSC or
the anchor MSC pool.
If the initiation of the voice group call had specified originator-to-
dispatcher information and processing of originator-to-dispatcher information
is supported by the originating VMSC, the originator-to-dispatcher information
is transformed by the originating VMSC into UUS1 and sent to the anchor MSC or
the anchor MSC pool. If the originating VMSC is the group call anchor MSC (or
belongs to the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool), along with the group
call attributes, the GCR shall provide information on all group call relay
MSCs or group call relay MSC pools to be involved.
The group call anchor MSC shall set up links to all group call relay MSCs or
relay MSC pools. It shall also initiate setup of point-to-point connections to
the dispatchers associated to the voice group call (see subclause 8.1.2.2); if
UUS1 information has been received in the signalling for call setup from the
originating VMSC, this UUS1 information is included in the setup of point-to-
point connections to the dispatchers. Each MSC involved in a voice group call
obtains its own group call attributes from the GCR related to the MSC.
The IMSI of the calling service subscriber must be provided to and stored in
the anchor MSC and each relay MSC in order to allow the calling service
subscriber to clear the group call later on.
**Dispatcher originated:** In the case of dispatchers calling from an external
network, the call request, in the form of an ISDN number, shall be received at
a GMSC. The number shall be analysed and the call shall be directly routed to
the group call anchor MSC or anchor MSC pool by the GMSC based on the called
identity without requesting an HLR. The group call anchor MSC shall
interrogate the GCR and obtain the group call attributes. If an identical
voice group call is currently in progress, the dispatcher shall be connected
to this call and no new call shall be initiated. When interrogating the GCR,
the identity of the calling dispatcher is compared with the list of
dispatchers which are allowed to initiate the call. If the dispatcher is not
in the list, or an identity is not provided, the network shall reject the
call.
NOTE 2: A dispatcher may be a user of the GSM network in which the VGCS
service is provided or may be connected to a PABX which is connected to the
MSC containing the GCR. A dispatcher which is registered in the GCR for a
certain voice group call and which also has a subscription for VGCS with the
same group ID as the voice group call for which he is dispatcher shall
deactivate this group ID when he is located in the corresponding group call
area in order to avoid conflicts between paging for the dispatcher and
notifications for the group ID.
## 5.2 Voice group call responsibility
The MSC responsible for the voice group call is the one nominated within the
GCR or the one to which the call is routed from the GMSC in the case of a
dispatcher originated call. This MSC is termed the group call anchor MSC.
If the group call area extends beyond one MSC area then any MSCs controlling
cells in the area outside of the group call anchor MSC are referred to as
group call relay MSCs.
In a RANflex configuration a given location area within the pool area is
served (with group call services) by a single predefined group call serving
MSC which for a specific group call is either anchor or relay MSC.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy a given location area
within the pool area is served (with group call services) by predefined group
call serving MSCs which form up the location area\'s group call serving MSC
redundancy pool. One MSC shall not belong to more than one group call MSC
redundancy pool. For a specific ongoing group call the group call serving
redundancy pool is either an anchor or a relay redundancy pool.
## 5.3 RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
### 5.3.1 MSC selection in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, messages routed towards
a group call MSC redundancy pool eventually need to be processed by a selected
MSC out of the redundancy pool. MSC selection is done with appropriate routing
mechanisms at call setup time.
Mixed configurations where e.g. the anchor MSC belongs to an anchor MSC
redundancy pool but the relay MSC does not belong to a Relay MSC redundancy
pool may be considered a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
where e.g. the relay MSC redundancy pool is formed up by just one relay MSC.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy the following messages
sent to an MSC do not address an individual MSC but an MSC redundancy pool:
\- IAM (from dispatcher to Anchor MSC);
\- IAM (from VMSC to Anchor MSC);
\- SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO (from VMSC to Group Call Serving MSC);
\- PREPARE_GROUP_CALL (from Anchor MSC to Relay MSC); and
\- MT_FORWARD_SM_FOR_VGCS (from SMS-GMSC to Anchor MSC).
Network routing ensures that these messages are routed to one of the available
(i.e. not out of service) MSCs within the redundancy pool. MSC selection by
network routing can be based e.g. on a predefined prioritization mechanism or
a load distribution mechanism but the exact mechanism is out of scope of this
specification.
Once the message is received by one of the available MSCs, the receiving MSC
shall check whether there is the need to forward the message to another
specific MSC within the redundancy pool (for detailed behaviour of the MSC see
subclauses 11.4, 11.5, and 11.5A) . Network routing ensures that the forwarded
message is routed to the specific MSC. Specific MSC routing may be done e.g.
with address prefixes and is out of scope of this specification.
If the message forwarding MSC detects that the specific target MSC is out of
service, it shall handle the request locally and repeat the GCR interrogation
with an override indication.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy the following messages
sent to an MSC address an individual MSC and not an MSC redundancy pool:
\- IAM (dispatcher originated) when forwarded within the group call anchor MSC
redundancy pool from selected Anchor MSC to the Anchor MSC where the group
call is on-going;
\- IAM (VMSC originated) when forwarded within the group call anchor MSC
redundancy pool from selected Anchor MSC to the Anchor MSC where the group
call is on-going;
\- IAM (from Anchor MSC to Relay MSC) routed with the temporary group call
number allocated by the Relay MSC;
\- SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO (VMSC originated) when forwarded within the group call
serving MSC redundancy pool from selected group call serving MSC to the group
call serving MSC where the group call is on-going;
\- Subsequent messages within a dialogue opened by a PREPARE_GROUP_CALL
message (PREPARE_GROUP_CALL_ACK, SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL,
FORWARD_GROUP_CALL_SIGNALLING; PROCESS_GROUP_CALL_SIGNALLING). MAP dialogue
handling ensures that messages are exchanged between origin and selected
destination of the dialogue; and
\- MT_FORWARD_SM_FOR_VGCS (SMS-GMSC originated) when forwarded within the
group call anchor MSC redundancy pool from selected Anchor MSC to the Anchor
MSC where the group call is on-going.
Network routing ensures that these messages are routed to the individual MSC
within the redundancy pool.
## 5.3.2 GCR synchronization in a RANflex configuration with group call
redundancy
GCRs associated to MSCs which belong to the same redundancy pool need to
synchronize their transient data. This is done by means of SYNC_GCR messages.
As soon as transient data are modified in a GCR as a result of GCR
interrogation from the associated MSC, the modification is propagated to the
other GCRs.
This mechanism prevents the establishment of two simultaneous group calls with
the same group call reference controlled by two different anchor MSCs.
## 5.3.3 GCR Restoration in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
When a GCR (and its associated MSC) restarts after planned or unplanned
outage, its transient data may be lost or may be out of sync due to lost
SYNC_GCR messages. To restore the transient data, the GCR shall after restart
\- stop all T3 timers;
\- delete all stored initial talker information; and
\- mark all GCR records with \"transient data not reliable\".
When transient data are read while processing a GCR interrogation, the GCR
shall check whether the record is marked \"transient data not reliable\". If
so, the GCR shall retrieve transient data from the other GCR(s) within the
redundancy pool by means of a SYNC_GCR message with request indication, store
it and reset the mark \"transient data not reliable\" before processing the
GCR interrogation. If the retrieval of transient data is unsuccessful, the GCR
shall assume that the call is not on-going, reset the mark \"transient data
not reliable\" and process the GCR interrogation.
When processing a received SYNC_GCR message without request indication while
the record is marked \"transient data not reliable\", the GCR shall accept the
request and reset the \"transient data not reliable\" mark.
When processing a received SYNC_GCR message with request indication while the
record is marked \"transient data not reliable\", the GCR shall return a
negative response (failure) and keep the \"transient data not reliable\" mark.
# 6 Compatibility issues
VGCS can not be used with standard Phase 1 or Phase 2 mobile stations. A
dedicated mobile station with VGCS capability is required.
A mobile station with VGCS capability shall also provide the complete
functionality in order to allow the use of Phase 2 services.
Standard Phase 1 and Phase 2 mobile stations in a network shall not be
impacted by the presence of VGCS services in that network due to VGCS
signalling, also if the mobile station is operated with a SIM/USIM of a VGCS
service subscriber.
# 7 Transmission
## 7.1 Transmission architecture
A conference bridge is required to connect the transmission paths of the
nominated cells. The bridge is to be located within the group call anchor MSC.
Without a RANflex configuration: The group call anchor MSC is responsible for
setting up all connections, both to the nominated cells (voice group call
channels) in the group call anchor MSC and to any related group call relay
MSC, and to the dispatchers. Except when a calling service subscriber, served
by a relay MSC, is on the initial dedicated link, there shall be one link
towards every relay MSC and a distribution function in the relay MSCs and from
there one link per cell within the group call relay MSC which is involved in
the voice group call.
In a RANflex configuration: The group call anchor MSC is responsible for
setting up all connections, both to those cells of the group call area that
belong to a location area for which the group call anchor MSC is the group
call serving MSC and to any related group call relay MSC, and to the
dispatchers. Except when a calling service subscriber, served by a relay MSC,
is on the initial dedicated link, there shall be one link towards every relay
MSC and a distribution function in the relay MSCs and from there one link per
cell of the group call area that belongs to a location area for which the
group call relay MSC is the group call serving MSC which is involved in the
voice group call.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: The group call anchor
MSC selected from the anchor MSC redundancy pool is responsible for setting up
all connections, both to those cells of the group call area that belong to a
location area for which the group call anchor MSC is the group call serving
MSC and to any related group call relay MSC pool, and to the dispatchers.
Except when a calling service subscriber, served by a relay MSC, is on the
initial dedicated link, there shall be one link towards every relay MSC
redundancy pool and a distribution function in the selected relay MSCs and
from there one link per cell of the group call area that belongs to a location
area for which the group call relay MSC is the group call serving MSC which is
involved in the voice group call.
For all configurations the following applies:
While the calling service subscriber is on a dedicated link served by his
VMSC, there is an additional link from the anchor MSC to the VMSC serving the
calling service subscriber and an additional link from the VMSC serving the
calling service subscriber to the cell serving the calling service subscriber.
There shall be no secondary bridges in BSCs.
While a talker served by a relay MSC is on any other dedicated or group
channel than the initial dedicated channel , the following applies: The
distribution function shall be implemented using a secondary conference bridge
at the relay MSC so that VGCS talker speech sent on the current channel uplink
is transmitted to local relay cells as well as being transmitted over the link
back to the anchor MSC, for distribution to the rest of the network,
dispatchers and nominated cells at other relay MSCs.
The conference bridge shall not mute the uplink speech.
## 7.1a Transmission architecture -- A interface circuit sharing
## 7.1a.1 Transmission architecture -- General
The MSC and BSC shall negotiate during the setup of a voice group call whether
A-interface circuit sharing is supported by both entities. When this optional
feature is supported by both entities, the same A-interface circuit can be
shared for all cells belonging to a BSC for a given voice group call. When
AoIP is used, the same AoIP transport layer information can be shared for all
cells belonging to a BSC for a given voice group call.
A conference bridge is required to connect the transmission paths of the
nominated cells. The bridge is to be located within the group call anchor MSC.
The group call anchor MSC is responsible for setting up all connections, both
to the nominated cells (voice group call channels) in the group call anchor
MSC and in any related group call relay MSC, and to the dispatchers
The BSC contains a distribution function that distributes speech sent from the
MSC to each of the nominated cells.
### 7.1a.2 Transmission architecture -- Control Plane
The control plane signalling shall be the same as in sub-clause 7.1.
### 7.1a.3 Transmission architecture -- User Plane
In the case of an originator that is not on the initial dedicated link, there
shall be one link from the anchor MSC towards every relay MSC. There will be
one link from each of these relay MSCs and the group call anchor MSC to each
BSC controlled by the respective MSC and involved in the voice group call.
Each of these BSCs contains a distribution function that distributes speech
received from the MSC to each cell involved in the group call.
When an originator, served by a relay MSC, is on the initial dedicated link,
there is an additional link from the anchor MSC to the relay MSC serving the
originator and an additional link from the relay MSC serving the originator to
the cell serving the originator.
When an originator, served by an anchor MSC, is on the initial dedicated link,
there shall be one link from the anchor MSC towards every relay MSC. There
will be one link from each of these MSCs and the group call anchor MSC to each
BSC controlled by the respective MSC and involved in the voice group call.
Each of these BSCs contains a distribution function, with one link to each
cell and involved in the group call. There is an additional link from the
anchor MSC to the cell serving the originator.
While a talker served by an anchor MSC is on any other dedicated or group
channel than the initial dedicated channel, the following distribution
functions shall be implemented:
\- conference bridge at the anchor MSC so that VGCS talker speech sent on the
current channel uplink is transmitted to local cells as well as being
transmitted over the links to the relay MSCs, for distribution to the rest of
the network, dispatchers and nominated cells at other relay MSCs;
\- distribution point at the BSC so that speech sent from the MSC is
distributed to each of the nominated cells.
While a talker served by a relay MSC is on any other dedicated or group
channel than the initial dedicated channel, the following distribution
functions shall be implemented:
\- secondary conference bridge at the relay MSC so that VGCS talker speech
sent on the current channel uplink is transmitted to local cells as well as
being transmitted over the link back to the anchor MSC, for distribution to
the rest of the network, dispatchers and nominated cells at other relay MSCs;
\- distribution point at the BSC so that speech sent from the MSC is
distributed to each of the nominated cells.
The conference bridge shall not mute the uplink speech.
### 7.1b Transmission architecture -- A interface link sharing
## 7.1b.1 Transmission architecture -- General
The MSC and BSC shall negotiate during the setup of a voice group call whether
A-interface link sharing is supported by both entities. When this optional
feature is supported by both entities, the same A-interface link (user and
control plane) can be shared for all cells belonging to a BSC for a given
voice group call.
A conference bridge is required to connect the transmission paths of the
nominated cells. The bridge is to be located within the group call anchor MSC.
The group call anchor MSC is responsible for setting up a single A-interface
link (i.e. either A-interface circuit or A interface IP address and UDP port
value in case of AoIP and resource controlling SCCP connection) to each BSC
containing nominated cells in the group call anchor MSC and links to any group
call relay MSCs and to the dispatchers.
Each BSC is responsible for setting up a speech and signalling connection
(voice group call channel) to each nominated cell in the group call area
served by this BSC. The BSC contains a distribution function that distributes
speech and resource control related signalling from the MSC to each of the
nominated cells.
### 7.1b.2 Transmission architecture -- Control Plane
The MSC shall inform the BSC of the cells required to be setup for the group
call in the VGCS ASSIGMENT REQUEST. This message shall contain the list of
group call area cells served by this BSC. If the entire list of cell
identifiers does not fit into the message or if different methods of radio
resource allocation (e.g. \"immediate allocation\"or \"delay allowed\") are to
be used for different cells controlled by the BSC, the MSC shall send one or
more VGCS AREA CELL INFO messages containing the remaining cell identifiers or
the cell identifiers of cells using a different method of radio resource
allocation. Once a channel could be established to the cell of origin or, if
the cell of origin is not served by this BSC, to any other cell, the VGCS
ASSIGMENT RESULT shall be sent to the MSC and timer Tast shall be started.
Timer Tast is used to measure the duration between periodic reports from the
BSC to the MSC of group call area cells for which channels have been assigned
or released since the last periodic report. When timer Tast expires, if new
cells in the group call area have been established or existing ones have been
released, pre-empted or failed, the MSC shall be informed of the changes. If
no changes have taken place nothing shall be sent. Timer Tast shall be started
again to measure the period of time until the next report. The timer shall be
stopped when the call is released.
Once all cells for a given group call area served by a BSC are established
this BSC shall immediately send a VGCS ASSIGNMENT_STATUS message to the MSC
indicating this and restart timer Tast. This information shall be used by the
MSC to determine the conditions for call set up as described in subclause
11.3.1.1.2.
The BSS is responsible to establish the channel to the different cells and
manage the signalling accordingly (e.g. HO decisions, pre-emption, re-
establishment of cells, priority uplink decision). The A-interface link (user
and control plane) between MSC and BSC shall only be released when the call is
released.
When the network supports uplink access option (i) as defined in subclause 7.2
(i.e. indication in uplink busy instructs the MS to use the group call channel
to send the uplink access message if the talker on the group call channel is
not in the same cell as the MS) the network shall include talker priority
information in all relevant A-interface messages on the resource controlling
SCCP connection, to distinguish between messages related to the current talker
and messages related to the subscriber requesting the uplink.
### 7.1b.3 Transmission architecture -- User Plane
The transmission architecture of the user plane as specified in subclause
7.1a.3 applies.
## 7.2 Radio channels
In each cell of the group call area one voice group call channel may be
established consisting of a downlink received by all service subscribers'
mobile stations and an uplink which shall be used by the talking subscriber\'s
mobile station only.
If the network allocates a dedicated traffic channel for the calling service
subscriber, his mobile station shall use the dedicated standard
uplink/downlink which is connected to the conference bridge up to the instant
where the network decides that the mobile station shall join the voice group
call channel and the dedicated connection is released.
The network may decide to switch a talking subscriber\'s mobile station from
the voice group call channel to a dedicated standard uplink/downlink at any
time. The talking subscriber\'s voice group call channel and the dedicated
channel may belong to different cells within the group call area, i.e. the
network may request the talker to perform a handover. The dedicated connection
shall then be maintained up to the instance where the network decides that the
mobile station shall join the voice group call channel again and the dedicated
connection is released.
When the network indicates the uplink as free, the mobile station uses the
group call channel uplink to signal an uplink request, \"emergency mode reset
request\" or uplink request for sending application-specific data.
When the network does not indicate the uplink as free, there are two options
for the mobile station how to signal an uplink request with talker priority
higher than \"normal subscriber\", an \"emergency mode reset request\" or an
uplink request for sending application-specific data:
i) if the priority uplink access parameter broadcast on the NCH indicates
\"RACH access\" but the latest UPLINK BUSY message received in the cell
indicates that the group call channel uplink shall be used, the mobile station
sends an uplink access message on the group call channel uplink; otherwise,
the mobile station temporarily leaves the group receive mode and sends a
channel request message on the RACH. Once a dedicated connection has been
established by the network, the mobile station sends a layer 3 message
PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST or DATA INDICATION 2. The PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST
message contains the MS identity (IMSI or TMSI), the group call reference,
random reference, the type of request and the token broadcast by the BSS, if
the BSS broadcasts a token. On receipt of this information, the network shall
release the dedicated connection, and the mobile station shall return to the
group receive mode and continue to listen on the downlink of the group call
channel for further instructions from the network.
NOTE 1: The indication in uplink busy instructs the MS to use the group call
channel uplink to send the uplink access message if the talker on the group
call channel is not in the same cell as the MS.
If the mobile station releases the uplink on request of the subscriber, it
shall use the group call channel uplink for signalling subsequent uplink
requests, until it performs a cell change or receives either an UPLINK BUSY
message indicating that RACH shall be used or a VGCS UPLINK GRANT message
destined for a different mobile station.
ii) If the priority uplink access parameter broadcast on the NCH indicates
\"group call channel uplink access\" then the mobile station always sends an
uplink access message on the group call channel uplink. If this option is
used, the network shall always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for
the talking service subscriber.
NOTE 2: Otherwise, with option (ii) the BSC would not be able to detect the
requests of higher privileged talkers in the cell where the current talking
service subscriber is located.
Support of both options is mandatory for a mobile station supporting the use
of talker priorities or transfer of application-specific data and optional for
the network. A network supporting the use of talker priorities or transfer of
time-critical application-specific data shall indicate the default procedure
to be used on the NCH (i.e. either \"RACH access\" or \"group call channel
uplink access\"). The indication shall have the same value throughout the
network. If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used in a network, then the
value of the indication shall be set to \"RACH access\".
A listening subscriber\'s mobile station which responds to a notification
because no description of the voice group call channel was provided in the
notification may be assigned a dedicated standard uplink/downlink up to the
instant where the radio access network decides that the mobile station shall
join the voice group call channel and the dedicated connection is released.
Voice group call channels shall be standard full rate or half rate speech
channels, EFR speech channels, full rate AMR speech or half rate AMR speech
channels. The support of voice group call channels other than full rate speech
is a network option. A specific voice group call can use either the same
speech codec type in all cells of the group call area or different speech
codec types in different cells of the group call area. Those implementations
are optional for the network operator.
When establishing an AMR half rate or AMR full rate speech channel, the BSC
shall select a suitable AMR codec configuration:
\- for a dedicated channel used by a talking service subscriber, the BSC may
select any configuration permitted for a point-to-point call;
\- for a voice group call channel the BSC shall select one of the preferred
configurations as defined in 3GPP TS 28.062 [16], Table 7.11.3.1.3-2. For the
downlink the BSC shall disable the rate adaptation mechanism and apply a
single codec mode until the channel is released. If the talking service
subscriber uses the voice group call channel uplink and the BSC selected a
multi-mode configuration, the BSC shall apply the rate adaptation mechanism
for the uplink.
> Within a cell the BSC shall select the same codec configuration for all
> voice group and voice broadcast calls using the same AMR codec type, AMR FR
> or AMR HR, respectively. The selected configuration shall be broadcast on
> the NCH, as long as at least one voice group or voice broadcast call using
> the respective AMR codec type is active.
When A-interface circuit sharing or A-interface link sharing applies there is
one A-interface circuit allocated for the group call per BSC. In case of AoIP,
there is one A-interface IP and port allocated for the group call per BSC.
Therefore the same speech codec is applied for all voice group channels in the
part of the group call area served by one BSC if the TRAU is located between
the MSC and the BSC-internal distribution function for speech (see subclause
7.1a.1 and 7.1b.1).
Mobile station using the uplink are in group transmit mode. Signalling for
this RR mode is specified in 3GPP TS 44.018. Mobile stations not using the
uplink and not in dedicated mode shall ignore any signalling concerned only
with uplink usage.
Full standard duplex channels shall be provided to all dispatchers listed in
the GCR. These may be provided either via GSM, or via an external network. The
links to the dispatchers are connected to the conference bridge.
If the mobile station of the talking service subscriber joins the voice group
call channel, it will transmit on the uplink of the voice group call channel.
## 7.3 Data confidentiality
Data confidentiality on the radio can be provided as a network option.
If data confidentiality is provided, both the uplink and the downlink of the
voice group call channel within a cell of the group call area shall be
ciphered using voice group ciphering keys derived from the same group key, see
3GPP TS 43.020 [10].
The group key is related to the group ID. For each group ID, there is a number
of group keys stored on the USIM which are identified by a group key number.
The group key number identifying the group key to be used for a particular
voice group call is provided with the notification to the mobile stations.
Mobile stations which have a dedicated connection shall be informed of the
group key number before they join the voice group call channel.
USIM based VGCS ciphering uses a concept of short term keys where the short
term key is derived by the GCR and the USIM from the group key and a RAND
(random number) parameter. The actual voice group ciphering key is then
derived by the BSS and the ME from the short term key, the cell global
identifier, and a Cell Global Count parameter.
To include a subscriber into a voice group the required group data (including
the 2 master group keys) shall be stored on the USIM, e.g. during the
personalisation process or via OTA (over-the-air). To exclude a subscriber
from a voice group the group data shall be deleted from the USIM. If a USIM is
lost or stolen, all USIMs of the remaining members of the voice groups that
this USIM is a member of need to be changed (e.g. via OTA or manual
provisioning).
Details on data confidentiality for voice group calls are provided in 3GPP TS
42.009 [9]and 3GPP TS 43.020 [10].
NOTE 1: USIM based VGCS ciphering is not compatible with SIM based VGCS
ciphering which has not been completely specified. The SIM specifications
contain no support for the storage of the group keys. A pre-Rel-6 VGCS capable
mobile station will be able to participate in an un-ciphered group call, if it
is part of that group.
If data confidentiality is provided, then for a mobile station in group mode
dedicated channel the uplink and the downlink of the dedicated channel shall
be ciphered using the individual ciphering key of the service subscriber.
NOTE 2: The individual ciphering key is the key generated during a previous
authentication procedure.
In order to start the ciphering for the calling service subscriber, the MSC
serving the mobile station shall initiate a cipher mode control procedure
during call setup, while the mobile station is in group mode dedicated
channel. When ciphering was started successfully, the mobile station shall
apply the individual ciphering key until it leaves group mode dedicated
channel or a new cipher mode control procedure is performed successfully.
In order to start the ciphering on the dedicated channel, if the network
decides to move a talking subscriber\'s mobile station from group transmit
mode to group mode dedicated channel, the network shall include cipher mode
setting information in the assignment command or handover command message (see
3GPP TS 43.020 [10], Annex F 3.2). On the dedicated channel the mobile station
shall apply the individual ciphering key until it leaves group mode dedicated
channel or a new cipher mode control procedure is performed successfully.
If data confidentiality is provided, then for a mobile dispatcher the uplink
and the downlink of the dedicated channel shall be ciphered using the
individual ciphering key of the dispatcher.
If data confidentiality is provided, the priority uplink request procedure can
be validated by a handshake between the requesting MS and the BSS. A32 bit
token is generated randomly and broadcast by the BSS on the ciphered downlink
of the voice group call channel and stored in the MS. When the MS sends a
priority uplink request it includes the token as a parameter and the BSS
checks this against its stored value. If it matches the request is processed
further. If it does not match, the request is ignored. A new token is
broadcast on the ciphered downlink of the voice group call channel each time a
match occurs and each time a periodic UPLINK_BUSY message is sent (i.e. every
T1 seconds) (refer to Figure 7e in section 11.3.8).
If data confidentiality is provided for point-to-point SMS over the CS domain,
the network shall broadcast an SMS data confidentiality indication in
NOTIFICATION/ NCH messages, NOTIFICATION/ FACCH messages and in the Connect
message sent to the calling service subscriber of a voice group call.
If guaranteed privacy is provided for SMS over the CS domain (see 3GPP TS
42.068 [2]), the network shall broadcast an SMS guaranteed privacy indication
in NOTIFICATION/ NCH messages, NOTIFICATION/ FACCH messages and in the Connect
message sent to the calling service subscriber of a voice group call.
NOTE 3: For backward compatibility with legacy networks the coding of these
indications in NOTIFICATION messages is chosen so that the default settings
are SMS data confidentiality = \"on\" and SMS guaranteed privacy = \"on\".
# 8 Information storage
## 8.1 Information stored in the GCR
### 8.1.1 Information used for routing of service subscriber originated voice
group calls
Without a RANflex configuration, the GCR shall hold for a related MSC area for
each group ID and cell from which voice group calls can be established by
service subscribers the group call reference to be used for a voice group call
to be established and an indication whether the originating MSC is the group
call anchor MSC.
In a RANflex configuration, the GCR shall hold for a related MSC area (i.e.
for those location areas for which the related MSC is the group call serving
MSC) for each group ID and cell (within those location areas for which the
related MSC is the group call serving MSC) from which voice group calls can be
established by service subscribers the group call reference to be used for a
voice group call to be established and an indication whether the group call
serving MSC is the group call anchor MSC.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, the GCR shall hold for
a related MSC area (i.e. for those location areas for which the related MSC
belongs to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool) for each group ID and
cell (within those location areas for which the related MSC can act as the
group call serving MSC) from which voice group calls can be established by
service subscribers the group call reference to be used for a voice group call
to be established and an indication whether the group call serving MSC belongs
to the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool.
If one of the following configurations applies:
a) without a RANflex configuration;
b) in a RANflex configuration, if the VMSC is the group call serving MSC; or
c) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the VMSC belongs
to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool:
If the VMSC is the group call anchor MSC or belongs to the group call anchor
MSC redundancy pool, the GCR shall provide the group call attributes related
to that group call reference as defined in subclause 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 to the
VMSC and the VMSC shall establish the voice group call.
If the VMSC is not the anchor MSC or does not belong to the group call anchor
MSC redundancy pool, the GCR shall provide the group call reference plus the
routing information identifying the anchor MSC or anchor MSC redundancy pool
to the VMSC and the VMSC shall route the voice group call to the anchor MSC or
anchor MSC redundancy pool.
If the following configuration applies:
d) in a RANflex configuration, if the VMSC is different from the group call
serving MSC:
If the group call serving MSC is a relay MSC for the group call, the GCR shall
provide the group call reference plus the routing information identifying the
anchor MSC to the group call serving MSC which passes this information to the
VMSC.
If the group call serving MSC is the anchor MSC for the group call, the GCR
shall provide the group call reference to the group call serving MSC which
adds the routing information identifying the anchor MSC (i.e. its own MSC
address) and passes the information to the VMSC.
Then the VMSC shall route the voice group call to the anchor MSC.
If the following configuration applies:
e) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the VMSC does not
belong to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool:
If the group call serving MSC redundancy pool is a group call relay MSC
redundancy pool for the group call, the GCR shall provide the group call
reference plus the routing information identifying the anchor MSC redundancy
pool to the requesting group call serving MSC which passes this information to
the VMSC.
If the group call serving MSC redundancy pool is the group call anchor MSC
redundancy pool for the group call, the GCR shall provide the group call
reference to the requesting group call serving MSC which adds the routing
information identifying the anchor MSC redundancy pool and passes the
information to the VMSC.
Then the VMSC shall route the voice group call to the anchor MSC redundancy
pool.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, the GCR shall provide
the requesting MSC with \"group call ongoing information\". If the group call
is ongoing at another MSC within the redundancy pool, the requesting MSC shall
forward the actual request to that MSC.
NOTE: In case the GCR function is distributed over different physical
entities, each may hold only the information needed to treat requests coming
from the MSCs connected to the physical GCR entity.
### 8.1.2 Static Group call attributes
The GCR stores a list of static Group Call Attributes for a given group call
reference. These lists shall be programmed by the service provider at
registration of the network specific service configuration. In RANflex
configurations with group call redundancy these lists shall be identical in
GCRs which are associated to MSCs belonging to the same redundancy pool.
The contents of each list related to requests of the group call anchor MSC is
as follows:
\- a list of cells inside the MSC area of the group call anchor MSC (in a
RANflex configuration with or without group call redundancy, the cells
belonging to a location area for which the group call anchor MSC is the group
call serving MSC) into which the call is to be sent (part of the group call
area), see subclause 8.1.2.1;
\- a list of group call relay MSCs (or group call relay MSC redundancy pools)
into which the call is to be sent;
\- information on the cipher algorithm and the group key to be used for this
voice group call;
\- information on the codecs allowed for this voice group call. As an operator
option, the EFR codec, standard half rate codec, AMR half rate codec, and AMR
full rate codec can be supported;
NOTE: A pre-Rel-7 VGCS capable mobile station will not be able to participate
in a group call using the EFR codec, AMR half rate codec or AMR full rate
codec, if the mobile station is part of that group
\- a list of identities of dispatchers to which a dedicated link is to be
established, see subclause 8.1.2.2;
\- a list of identities of dispatchers which are allowed to initiate the voice
group call, see subclause 8.1.2.2;
\- a list of identities of dispatchers which are allowed to terminate the
voice group call, see subclause 8.1.2.2;
\- the length of time over which no activity is detected before the voice
group call is automatically terminated, see subclause 8.1.2.3;
\- the default priority level related to the voice group call if eMLPP
applies, see subclause 8.1.2.4;
\- a talker channel parameter indicating if the network shall always establish
and maintain a dedicated channel for the talking service subscriber;
\- an indication whether the uplink reply procedure is applicable for this
voice group call.
\- in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: A list of GCR
addresses identifying GCRs associated to MSCs within the redundancy pool.
The contents of each list related to requests of a group call relay MSC is as
follows:
\- a list of cells inside the MSC area of the group call relay MSC (in a
RANflex configuration with or without group call redundancy, cells belonging
to a location area for which the requesting MSC is the group call serving MSC)
into which the call is to be sent (part of the group call area), see subclause
8.1.2.1;
\- identity of the group call anchor MSC (or group call anchor MSC redundancy
pool);
\- in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: A list of GCR
addresses identifying GCRs associated to MSCs within the redundancy pool.
#### 8.1.2.1 Group call area
The group call area is defined as a list of cells. The cells shall be defined
by their cell identification consisting of the Location Area Code and the Cell
Identity as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 and are therefore uniquely identified in
the network.
In the case the group call area extends over several MSCs, only the cells
belonging to the requesting MSC (in a RANflex configuration and in a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy, cells belonging to location areas
for which the requesting MSC is the group call serving MSC) are included in
the group call attributes.
#### 8.1.2.2 Dispatcher identities
Dispatcher identities shall be ISDN numbers or MSISDN numbers with the
structure according to ITU‑T Recommendation E.164. They shall correspond both
to the number to be used to establish a call toward the dispatcher and the
number provided as calling line identification when the call is originated by
a dispatcher.
The list of dispatcher identities is used by the anchor MSC to establish
dedicated communication paths to each dispatcher and connect them to the
conference bridge of the call.
The list of dispatcher identities which are allowed to initiate voice group
calls is used by the anchor MSC for verification for a voice group call
establishment by a dispatcher.
The list of dispatcher identities which are allowed to terminate voice group
calls is used by the anchor MSC for verification for a voice group call
release by a dispatcher.
#### 8.1.2.3 No activity time
A timer in the anchor MSC used to release the voice group call because of \"no
activity\" can be set to a fixed value or can be set to a value defined for
each voice group call.
A group call is defined to be in the state of \"no activity\" in the anchor
MSC, if the following conditions are all fullfilled:
\- the uplink is free;
\- no dispatcher is connected;
\- no short message is waiting in the anchor MSC to be sent to the voice group
call; and
\- no application-specific data are waiting in the anchor MSC to be relayed.
The anchor MSC shall check for the state of \"no activity\" if any of the
following events occur:
\- an uplink release is indicated to the anchor MSC;
\- a dispatcher leaves the ongoing group call;
\- the anchor MSC has completed the distribution of a short message to the
voice group call; or
\- the anchor MSC has completed the relay of application-specific data.
The anchor MSC has to start the \"no activity\" timer, when the conditions for
\"no activity\" are all fulfilled.
The timer shall be stopped and reset each time any of the following events
occurs:
\- an uplink request is indicated to the anchor MSC;
\- a dispatcher joins the ongoing group call;
\- a short message to the voice group call is received by the anchor MSC; or
\- application-specific data are received by the anchor MSC.
When a variable timer is provided, there shall be sufficient timers such that
one can be associated with each on-going group call. The corresponding time
shall be stored in the GCR.
The length of the timer is not specified in the GSM technical specifications.
#### 8.1.2.4 Priorities
If the eMLPP supplementary service is applied to a voice group call, the
priority level shall be stored in the GCR. For further details see 3GPP TS
23.067.
### 8.1.3 Transient Group Call Attributes
#### 8.1.3.0 General
The GCR stores transient data for a given group call reference. These data are
maintained by the GCR to reflect the current status of the corresponding group
call.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy Transient GCR Data needs
to be synchronized between all GCRs associated to MSCs belonging to the same
redundancy pool.
#### 8.1.3.1 Group Call Status Information
\- a status flag indicating if a voice group call with the related group call
reference is on-going, see subclause 11.3.1.1.1;
\- in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: Address of the MSC
within the redundancy pool, where the group call is ongoing (if so).
#### 8.1.3.2 Initial Talker Information
The relay MSC, and in a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) the group call serving MSC of the initiating service subscriber\'s
current LAC, if this MSC is different from the VMSC, interrogate the GCR twice
when setting up the voice group call: The first GCR interrogation is triggered
in the relay MSC by the service subscriber or in a RANflex configuration (with
or without group call redundancy) in the group call serving MSC by the MAP
service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO received from the VMSC. The second GCR
interrogation is triggered in the relay MSC by the MAP service Prepare Group
Call or in a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy), if
the anchor MSC is the group call serving MSC, by receiving the IAM from the
VMSC.
At the first GCR interrogation the GCR shall store transient data in the GCR
which are retrieved with the second GCR interrogation. These data are:
\- the initiating service subscriber\'s IMSI;
\- the initiating service subscriber\'s talker priority;
\- the initiating service subscriber\'s additional information; and
\- the originating cell id.
## 8.2 Information managed per subscriber
### 8.2.1 Stored in the HLR
The following additional information shall be stored in the HLR:
\- the subscription option for voice group calls which can be made in the
HPLMN only or also in case of roaming;
\- a list of all the group IDs a service subscriber is entitled to use.
\- optionally, for each group ID a list of the talker priorities the service
subscriber is allowed to use. The permission to use talker priority \"normal
subscriber\" is implied by the subscription for the group ID and does not need
to be stored explicitly;
Editor\'s note : Whether the HLR additionally stores for each group ID if the
subscriber is allowed to transmit application-specific data is ffs.
\- optionally, an information element containing operator specific additional
information about the subscriber.
The group IDs are defined in subclause 9.1.
A service subscriber shall not be provided with more than 50 group IDs.
### 8.2.2 Stored in the VLR
The list of all the group IDs and related subscription data a service
subscriber is entitled to use shall be brought forward to a VLR at the same
time as other subscriber information is copied, and VLR entries shall be
modified when corresponding HLR records are changed.
### 8.2.3 Stored in the SIM
The information detailed in subclause 8.2.1, except for the operator specific
additional information about the subscriber, also needs to be stored on the
SIM. The service subscriber shall be able to deactivate or reactivate a group
ID by MMI interaction so that the mobile station ignores notification messages
to this group ID, when the group ID is deactivated.
If prefixes are used together with group IDs, these prefixes are not stored on
the SIM. Moreover the group IDs on the SIM are stored without any prefix.
### 8.2.3a Stored in the USIM
The information detailed in subclause 8.2.1, except for the operator specific
additional information about the subscriber, also needs to be stored on the
USIM. The service subscriber shall be able to deactivate or reactivate a group
ID by MMI interaction so that the mobile station ignores notification messages
to this group ID, when the group ID is deactivated.
For each group ID where data confidentiality may be applied, the USIM needs to
store the cipher algorithm to be used and the possible group keys.
For each group ID the USIM needs to store indications whether the service
subscriber is allowed to transmit application-specific data.
If prefixes are used together with group IDs, these prefixes are not stored on
the USIM. Moreover the group IDs on the USIM are stored without any prefix.
## 8.3 Information used for routing of dispatcher originated voice group calls
Routing of dispatcher originated calls shall be performed on the MSISDN number
received at a GMSC in the Initial_Address_Message.
\- Because the group call reference is included in the called MSISDN number as
defined in subclause 9.2d the routing information can be derived by the
routing function of the GMSC. The GMSC afterwards directly routes the call
request to the group call anchor MSC without requesting an HLR.
# 9 Identities
## 9.1 Elementary identities for group calls
**a) Group ID**
The group ID is a sequence of decimal digits with a maximum length depending
on the composition of the group call reference defined under c). The length of
Group ID shall be in a range of 1 to 8 digits.
The mobile station derives the group ID from the group call reference by
identifying the longest group ID amongst those stored in the SIM/USIM and
matching the least significant digits of the group call reference. If no group
ID is stored in the SIM that matches the least significant digits of the group
call reference, the mobile station is not able to derive the group ID from the
group call reference.
NOTE 1: The network should use Group IDs matching an initial part of other
group IDs with greatest care, if at all.
EXAMPLE: A mobile station storing the group IDs 678, 2 678 and 42 678 (and
only those) in the SIM will derive group ID 2 678 from group call reference 13
452 678.
For definition of Group ID on the radio interface, A interface and Abis
interface, see 3GPP TS 44.068 [11].
For definition of Group ID coding on MAP protocol interfaces, see 3GPP TS
29.002 [13].
**b) Group call area ID**
The group call area ID is a sequence of decimal digits uniquely assigned to a
group call area in one network and with a maximum length depending on the
composition of the group call reference defined under c).
**c) Group call reference**
Each voice group call in one network is uniquely identified by its Group call
reference. The group call reference is a concatenated sequence of the group ID
(as the least significant part) and the group call area ID (as the most
significant part). The group call reference shall have a maximum length of 8
decimal digits. The composition of the group call area ID and the group ID can
be specific for each network operator.
* * *
Group call area ID Group ID
* * *
The group call reference is equal to the group ID when the group ID has a
length of 8 decimal digits.
For definition of Group Call Reference (with leading zeros inserted as
necessary) on the radio interface, A interface and Abis interface, see 3GPP TS
24.008 [7], 3GPP TS 44.018[5] and 3GPP TS 44.068 [11].
For definition of Group Call Reference coding (also known as ASCI Call
Reference, Voice Group Call Reference or Voice Broadcast Call Reference) on
MAP protocol interfaces, see 3GPP TS 29.002 [13].
NOTE 2: If prefixes are used together with group IDs, the least significant
digit of the group call area ID contains the prefix.
## 9.2 Use of identities in the network
For each voice group call the identifications as defined in the following
shall be used within the network for the related purpose mentioned.
For voice group call services which are to operate in more than one PLMN,
group identities have to be co-ordinated between the network operators
involved.
**a) Identities used for GCR requests for service subscriber originated voice
group calls**
For a service subscriber originated call, the identity of the call used by the
MSC in which the call is originated to interrogate the GCR shall consist of
the originating serving cell identity as defined in 3GPP TS 48.008 and the
group ID as defined in subclause 9.1. In a RANflex configuration (with or
without group call redundancy) the same identity is used by the group call
serving MSC to interrogate the GCR when it receives the MAP Send Group Call
Info service.
* * *
Originating cell ID **Group ID**
* * *
A service subscriber initiating a voice group call has to call the wanted
group ID. The MSC in which the call is originated shall accumulate from the
BSS the called group ID and the originating cell ID.
If the group call area exceeds one MSC area, the identity used to interrogate
the GCR by an MSC in which the call was not originated shall consist of the
group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1, except for the case in a
RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy) where the GCR
interrogation in the group call serving MSC is triggered by receipt of the MAP
Send Group Call Info service.
Without a RANflex configuration: If the group call area exceeds one MSC area
and the call was originated
\- in a relay MSC,
this relay MSC will perform a second GCR interrogation when the anchor MSC
sets up the link to the relay MSC (see subclause 11.5).
In a RANflex configuration: If the group call area exceeds one MSC area and
the call was originated
\- in a relay MSC; or
\- in a location area for which a relay MSC is the group call serving MSC,
this relay MSC will perform a second GCR interrogation when the anchor MSC
sets up the link to the relay MSC (see subclause 11.5).
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: If the group call area
exceeds one MSC area and the call was originated
\- in a relay MSC; or
\- in a location area for which a relay MSC (belonging to a redundancy pool)
is the group call serving MSC,
this relay MSC or another relay MSC belonging to the same redundancy pool will
perform a second GCR interrogation when the anchor MSC sets up the link to the
relay MSC (see subclause 11.5).
Independent of the configuration for the second GCR interrogation the relay
MSC shall use the group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1 as the
identity.
**b) Identities used for GCR requests for dispatcher originated voice group
calls**
In case of dispatcher originated call the identity used by the MSC to
interrogate the GCR shall consist of the group call reference as defined in
subclause 9.1.
**c) Identities used for notifications to service subscribers**
Identities used for notification messages shall consist of the group call
reference as defined in subclause 9.1.
**d) Identities used by dispatchers for voice group call establishment**
For dispatcher originated calls an MSISDN is dialled. The Country Code (CC)
and National Destination Code (NDC) are used as normal for routing purposes.
The CC and NDC may be omitted for internal calls. The numbering scheme is
based on ITU‑T Recommendation E.164. The Subscriber Number (SN) is used to
indicate:
\- the request of a group call by use of a prefix. The length of the prefix
shall be 1 to 2 digits;
\- the wanted group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1.
* * *
CC NDC Prefix Group call reference
* * *
**e) Identities used for VLR requests for service subscriber originated group
calls**
The group ID shall be used on the B-Interface for VLR requests.
**f) Anchor MSC address for routing of service subscriber originated calls
from originating MSC to anchor MSC**
For service subscriber originated calls an anchor MSC address is used as
called party address to route the call from the originating MSC to the anchor
MSC. The anchor MSC address structure is the same as for dispatcher originated
calls (see subclause d)) The Country Code (CC) and National Destination Code
(NDC) are used as normal for routing purposes. The numbering scheme is based
on ITU‑T Recommendation E.164. The Subscriber Number (SN) is used to indicate:
\- the request of a group call by use of a prefix. The length of the prefix
shall be 1 to 2 digits; the actual value of the prefix may be different than
the one dialled by dispatchers.
\- the wanted group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1.
* * *
CC NDC Prefix Group call reference
* * *
**g) Identities used for notifications to dispatchers**
Identities used for notification messages to dispatchers shall be identical to
those used by dispatchers to initiate calls as described in subclause d).
A notification identity is presented to a dispatcher terminal by making use of
CLIP. Between the anchor MSC and MSC to which the dispatcher is attached, the
information may be carried using the Calling Party Number parameter or Generic
Number Parameter as agreed between the network operators. The Country Code
(CC) and National Destination Code (NDC) are used as normal for routing
purposes. The numbering scheme is based on ITU‑T Recommendation E.164. The
Subscriber Number (SN) is used to indicate:
\- the indication of a group call by use of a prefix. The length of the prefix
shall be 1 to 2 digits; the actual value of the prefix shall be the same as
the one dialled by dispatchers
\- the group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1.
* * *
CC NDC Prefix Group call reference
* * *
The Screening Indicator shall be set to "Network Provided"
The Type of Number shall be set to "International"
# 10 Operation and maintenance aspects
NOTE: A list and short description of the operation and maintenance aspects
will be given. This includes the options and parameters which can be set by
the operator:
\- handling of timers;
\- registration aspects; etc.
# 11 Function and information flows
## 11.1 Group management
The group call attributes, as given in subclause 8.1 shall be entered and
modified by the service provider. A list providing information on necessary
Operation and Maintenance actions is given in clause 10.
## 11.2 Group membership management
Once the membership is established, the individual membership of the group can
be placed in an active or deactive state on the SIM/USIM by the user. If a
subscriber has a group ID in an active state, the subscriber is able to
establish voice group calls corresponding to that group ID.
In a deactive state the mobile station prevents the service subscriber from
establishing calls using the group ID and the corresponding notifications need
to be \"ignored\" by the mobile station.
The active state and deactive state entries may be password protected as an
implementation option.
Group IDs are listed in the subscription data within the network and on the
SIM/USIM. The SIM/USIM must be returned to the network operator or service
provider for updating if the subscription is to be changed.
NOTE 1: Updating of subscription data over the radio interface is not
considered. However, this shall not preclude future applications if
corresponding mechanisms may be implemented.
Users can interrogate their mobile stations to determine to which groups they
are members and which subscriptions are currently in an active state.
NOTE 2: Distribution and management of group ID prefixes is outside the scope
of this specification.
## 11.3 Call management
### 11.3.1 Call establishment
A voice group call can be established by either a service subscriber or by a
dispatcher.
#### 11.3.1.1 Service subscriber call establishment
##### 11.3.1.1.1 Initial stage
The initial signalling from the calling service subscriber informs the network
that a voice group call is required and details the group ID; it may specify
originator-to-dispatcher information. No information relative to the group
call area is given by the calling service subscriber. As an option the calling
service subscriber may add a prefix to the group ID, which is taken into
acount by the network when selecting the area.
The network shall perform a number of checks in order to determine how to
handle the call:
\- check of the ability of the subscriber to establish the call;
\- check whether the call can be initiated from the cell;
\- check of the existence of an on-going call of the same group call
reference.
The originating MSC shall check the VLR records for the ability of the
subscriber to start the call. If the service subscriber has no subscription
for the voice group call service with the indicated group ID, the call shall
be released. In addition, the VLR shall return barring and identity
presentation restriction checks to the MSC.
In a RANflex configuration the originating MSC shall then derive the group
call serving MSC address from the originating location area. If the group call
serving MSC is different from the originating MSC (or in a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy if the originating MSC does not
belong to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool) then the group call
serving MSC is interrogated by means of the MAP service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
The interrogation request contains the originating Cell Id and the Group Id.
It also contains the initiating service subscriber\'s IMSI, the actual talker
priority, and subscribed additional information.\ If the group call serving
MSC is a relay MSC for the group call, then its GCR shall derive the anchor
MSC address and the group call reference from the originating Cell Id and
Group Id, and return it to the VMSC. If the group call serving MSC is the
anchor MSC for the group call, then its GCR shall derive the group call
reference from the originating Cell Id and Group Id, and return it to the
VMSC.
Without RANflex configuration or if in a RANflex configuration with or without
group call redundancy the originating MSC is the group call serving MSC
(derived from the originating location area) it shall then request information
from the GCR by giving the group ID and the originating cell ID as defined in
subclause 9.2.
If the group ID has a length of 8 decimal digits, the operator can define for
this group ID only one group call and one group call area within his network.
If the length of the group ID is less than 8 decimal digits, the operator can
define more than one group call using the same group ID, but different group
call areas. Because of the possibility of overlapping group call areas, each
call requires a unique reference, assigned by the GCR related to the
originating MSC or the group call serving MSC (in a RANflex configuration with
or without group call redundancy). The group call reference shall be composed
of the group ID and a group call area ID (see clause 9).
If the length of the group ID is less than 8 decimal digits, the GCR first
derives the group call area ID from the group ID and the originating cell ID.
If no group call area ID is related to the group ID and originating cell ID,
the call shall be released. If a group call area ID is related to the group ID
and originating cell ID, the GCR shall transfer the corresponding group call
attributes to the MSC.
In a network supporting prefixes together with group IDs, the operator can
define more than one group call area for a specific combination of group ID
and originating cell ID. In such a network, if the calling service subscriber
has added a prefix to the group ID, the GCR shall derive the group call area
ID from the prefix. The last digit of the group call area ID shall match the
prefix. If the prefix is not provided or does not match the last digit of the
group call area IDs to be considered, the network shall select a default value
for the prefix and derive the group call area ID from this default prefix. The
default value for the prefix is dependent on the network of the originating
MSC.
NOTE 1: Typically, the group call area ID derived from the default prefix
value will select a complete group call membership, not a subset, and the
group call area will include the group call areas derived from the other
prefix values.
NOTE 2: A mobile station not supporting the use of prefixes with group IDs can
only set up voice group calls to the group defined by the default prefix.
If the group ID has a length of 8 decimal digits, the group call reference is
equal to the group ID. The GCR shall check whether the call was initiated
within the group call area stored in the GCR. If not, the call shall be
released; otherwise, the GCR shall transfer the corresponding group call
attributes to the MSC.
When the GCR has transfered the group call attributes to the MSC, the call
shall be considered as on-going by the GCR, unless the GCR\'s associated MSC
acts as group call relay MSC in a RANflex configuration with or without group
call redundancy.
The GCR of the relay MSC and in a RANflex configuration with or without group
call redundancy, if the group call serving MSC of the initiating service
subscriber\'s current LAC is different from the VMSC, the GCR of this group
call serving MSC shall store the initiating service subscriber\'s IMSI, talker
priority, additional information and originating cell id for later processing.
If the originating MSC is not the group call anchor MSC for the voice group
call as indicated in the GCR, then the voice group call request shall be
passed to the group call anchor MSC; in that case, if the initiation of the
voice group call had specified originator-to-dispatcher information and
processing of originator-to-dispatcher information is supported by the MSC,
the originator-to-dispatcher information is transformed by the originating MSC
into UUS1 and sent to the anchor MSC.
When passing the call request to the anchor MSC the originating MSC shall
include the VGCS prefix plus group call reference in the calling party number
of the IAM. If in a RANflex configuration the originating MSC is not the group
call serving MSC, it shall in addition include the address of the group call
serving MSC in the generic number parameter of the IAM, with the number
qualifier indicator set to \"additional calling party number\". Without
RANflex configuration or if in a RANflex configuration with or without group
call redundancy the originating MSC is the group call serving MSC, it shall
additionally include the address of the originating relay MSC in the generic
number parameter of the IAM, with the number qualifier indicator set to
\"additional calling party number\", when passing the call request to the
anchor MSC.
If the group call reference is composed of Group ID and group call area ID, it
is possible that two service subscribers or a service subscriber and a
dispatcher or two dispatchers may attempt to establish a call using the same
group ID and corresponding to the same group call area ID. If the two voice
group calls are established with the same group ID but for different group
call areas then separate voice group calls shall be established. If the group
call areas overlap, it is up to receiving mobile station to determine which
call to participate in. If more than one call is made to identical group ID
and group call area, the network shall reject all but one of the call
attempts.
If the group ID has a length of 8 decimal digits, if more than one call
attempt is made to the same group ID, the network shall reject all but one of
the call attempts.
A service subscriber which is entitled by his subscription to establish voice
group calls while roaming shall only be able to use supra-PLMN group IDs as
defined in subclause 9.1 in case of roaming. In case of roaming, the mobile
station shall only react on notifications for supra-PLMN group IDs.
If the GCR receives a new interrogation related to a group call reference
where the call is indicated as on-going in the GCR, the GCR shall provide the
on-going status together with the group call reference and - in a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy - together with the address of the
MSC within the redundancy pool where the group call is ongoing back to the
MSC. The MSC shall then
a) in a configuration without RANflex;
b) in a RANflex configuration; and
c) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the group call is
ongoing at the requesting MSC:
release the call with a cause user busy in case of a service subscriber
originated call request. The mobile station of the service subscriber shall
then look for notifications of the respective group ID on the NCH and join the
voice group call.
In case of a dispatcher originated voice group call request, the MSC shall
join the dispatcher to the conference bridge of the voice group call, or
d) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the group call is
ongoing at another MSCwithin the redundanc pool:
forward the original request to the MSC within the redundancy pool where the
group call is ongoing.
Authentication of the calling service subscriber can be performed by the
network as for normal calls.
##### 11.3.1.1.2 Establishment of the transmission means
A voice group call channel shall be established in all the cells throughout
the identified group call area using physical channels selected by the BSCs as
appropriate. The downlink channels shall be established without any return
signalling from mobile stations. Whilst the downlink channel is being
established, the MSC shall form a conference bridge containing the appropriate
channels to all BTSs in the group call area or in case of A-interface link
sharing to all BSCs in the group call area. The MSC is responsible for adding
dispatchers to the conference bridge.
Alternatively, the network may establish voice group call channels in a cell
on demand, i.e. if mobile stations respond to the notifications as defined in
subclause 4.2.2.1 (see \"uplink reply procedure\"). As a network option the
applicability of the uplink reply procedure for a voice group call can be
controlled by the GCR of the anchor MSC. If the anchor MSC supports this
feature, it shall allow all affected BSCs to establish voice group call
channels on demand only if the GCR indicates that the uplink reply procedure
is applicable. If the relay MSC supports this feature, it shall allow all
affected BSCs to establish voice group call channels on demand only if the
anchor MSC indicates during the establishment of the voice group call that the
uplink reply procedure is applicable.
In parallel, a dedicated suitable traffic channel may be allocated to the
calling service subscriber if not already the case.
If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used and indicates that the network
shall always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the talking
service subscriber, a dedicated suitable traffic channel shall be allocated to
the calling service subscriber. If there are not sufficient radio resources in
the originating cell to allocate a dedicated channel and a group call channel,
the group call establishment fails and the voice group shall be released.
The call will be considered established provided that at least the downlink
channel in the originating cell, in the case of a service subscriber
originated voice group call, or the downlink channel in any one cell within
the group call area, in the case of a dispatcher originated voice group call,
is established. The MSC shall signal to the calling service subscriber that
this has occurred so that he knows when to start speaking. If a voice group
call does not meet the above conditions in a pre-set time (Txx) then the call
shall be released.
The mobile station shall indicate connection to the subscriber. If channels
could not be established in particular cells because of congestion, channels
are allocated to these cells as soon as possible.
The MSC may retry the VGCS Assignment procedure to establish channels in cells
where they are missing. If supported, the procedure may be initiated when:
i) congestion (i.e. a lack of A-interface circuits) prevented the VGCS
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message from being sent to the BSS;
ii) a VGCS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message is received and the cause value
indicates an acceptable reason for retry (e.g. no radio resource available);
iii) the radio and terrestrial resources for the group call channel are
cleared (group call on-going) and the cause value indicates an acceptable
reason for retry (e.g. pre-emption);
iv) no response to the VGCS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is received (this is
determined by the MSC in an implementation-dependent manner such as expiry of
a timer); or
v) no response is received following receipt of a VGCS QUEUING INDICATION
(this is determined by the MSC in an implementation-dependent manner such as
expiry of a timer).
NOTE: If A-interface link sharing or group call re-establishment by the BSS
apply, the BSC is responsible for establishing/re-establishing channels in
cells and scenario (ii) and (iii) do not apply, unless A-interface resources
also need to be re-established (e.g. when the PCM system serving the
A-interface circuit fails (equipment failure)). Scenario (v) does not apply to
A-interface link sharing and group call re-establishment by the BSS.
The MSC may repeat the VGCS assignment procedure until a VGCS ASSIGNMENT
RESULT message is received, the call is released or an unacceptable reason for
retry (e.g. protocol error between BSS and MSC) is received by the MSC. The
time between subsequent retries is implementation-dependent. The MSC shall
send each retry of the VGCS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST over a new resource-controlling
SCCP connection.
If a message is received with an unacceptable reason for retry then existing
procedures apply. I.e. the MSC shall initiate the clearing of the radio and
terrestrial resources, if necessary, and no further attempts to establish a
group call channel in the cell are made.
While using the retry procedure the MSC shall maintain the call controlling
SCCP connection to a BSS until the call is released or until the MSC decides
to stop any further attempts to establish group call channels for the call on
a BSS where no cells are established.
##### 11.3.1.1.3 Release of the dedicated transmission means of the calling
service subscriber
The calling service subscriber shall be given a dedicated connection up to the
time where the network requests him to join the voice group call channel. If
the calling service subscriber is not talking, the network requests him to
join the voice group call channel as a listener by use of a channel release
procedure. Otherwise, the network shall request him to join the voice group
call channel as a talker by either a channel assignment procedure or a
handover procedure or a channel mode modify procedure.
If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used and indicates that the network
shall always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the talking
service subscriber, then the network shall not request the calling service
subscriber to join the group call channel as long as he is talking.
For the time when the voice group call is established until the calling
service subscriber becomes a listening service subscriber for the first time,
the \"uplink busy\" flag is set (see subclause 11.3.8). Mobile stations shall
be programmed such that if they originate the call, they indicate to the user
that it is required that an indication of the desire to speak should be made
if he wants to speak. If this is not done within a certain time, the mobile
station sends an UPLINK_REL message to the network and the uplink shall become
free.
##### 11.3.1.1.4 Release of the dedicated transmission means of mobile
stations responding to a notification
Mobile stations which respond to a notification for which no description of
the voice group call channel was given in the notification message may be
given a dedicated connection up to the time where the network requests the
mobile station to join the voice group call channel. If the service subscriber
is not talking, the network requests him to join the voice group call channel
as a listener by use of a channel release procedure. Otherwise, the network
shall request him to join the voice group call channel as a talker by either a
channel assignment procedure or a handover procedure or a channel mode modify
procedure.
##### 11.3.1.1.5 void
##### 11.3.1.1.6 void
#### 11.3.1.2 Dispatcher call establishment
In the case of dispatchers originated calls the call request, in the form of
an MSISDN number, shall be received at a GMSC. Such a call can be treated by
the GMSC as a normal mobile terminated call. In this case, the GMSC shall
interrogate an HLR, determined on the basis of the MSISDN number. The HLR in
turn may either interrogate the appropriate MSC/VLR to obtain an MSRN, or may
supply an MSRN predefined in the HLR and related to the respective group call
reference in the MSC/VLR. If the HLR interrogates the MSC/VLR for the MSRN,
the HLR shall provide this MSC/VLR with the related IMSI including the group
call reference as defined in clause 9.
Alternatively, the call request can be forwarded directly to the related group
call anchor MSC on basis of the GMSC\'s internal routing table. In this case,
the group call reference shall already be included in the requested MSISDN
number as defined in clause 9.
When interrogated by the group call anchor MSC, the GCR shall check if the
calling line identity is within the list of dispatcher identities allowed to
establish the voice group call. If not the case, the call shall be rejected.
After reception of the call request, the group call anchor MSC checks whether
an on-going call of the same group call reference exists, in which case for
the following configurations
a) for configurations with or without RANflex;
b) for RANflex configurations; and
c) for RANflex configurations with group call redundancy where the group call
is ongoing at the call request receiving MSC:
the group call anchor MSC shall add the dispatcher to the call, and for the
following configuration
d) for RANflex configurations with group call redundancy where the group call
is ongoing at another MSC within the redundancy pool:
the call request receiving MSC shall forward the call request to the MSC where
the group call is ongoing.
At the point at which notification messages are sent to mobile stations, a
tone is relayed to the calling dispatcher to inform the dispatcher that the
message can commence.
#### 11.3.1.3 Notification procedures
Different notification procedures shall be applied in relation to the mode of
the mobile station as presented in Table 1 and Table 2 and defined in the
following sections.
Table 1: Overview on different information messages for new or on-going calls
+------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | **Incoming call | VBS or VGCS call | point-to-point call | | type:** | | | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | **MS states:** | | | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | Idle mode | (section a) | (standard paging) | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | Group mode, dedicated | (section b) | (section c) | | channel | | | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | group receive mode and | | | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | group transmit mode | (section b) | (section c) | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | dedicated mode | (section b) | (standard Call | | | | Waiting) | | | | | | | | (note) | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+ | NOTE: only for point | | | | to point calls with | | | | certain restrictions | | | | as defined in | | | | 3GPP TS 22.083. | | | +------------------------+------------------+------------------------+
Table 2: Overview on different information messages for incoming point-to-
point short messages
* * *
MS states: Incoming point-to-point short messages Idle mode (standard paging)
group mode, dedicated channel (standard SMS delivery) (note) group receive
mode (section c) group transmit mode (standard SMS delivery or section c)
(note) dedicated mode (standard SMS delivery) (note) NOTE: see subclause
11.3.9.2.
* * *
**a) Notification for mobile stations in idle mode**
Once the voice group call channel has been established in a cell or the
network is waiting to receive notification responses to establish a voice
group call channel, notifications shall be broadcast on the NCH in that cell.
The position of the NCH is derived from the system information of the BCCH.
The notification messages shall include the group call reference and possibly
the description of the voice group call channel, the call priority if eMLPP is
applied, the group cipher key number, and the emergency mode indication, if
applicable.
A notification message can contain no, one or more notifications.
The notification process needs to continue throughout the duration of the
group call, in order to permit the \"late entry\" of other mobile stations.
Mobile stations moving into the group call area which are in idle mode shall
be directed to the voice group call channel by the notification messages,
possibly by means of the notification response procedure.
The scheduling of the notification messages in a cell shall be managed by the
BSS. Information can be added in the messages to limit the required reception
of NCH messages. The following constraints shall be met:
\- the three first initial notifications (i.e. the first for a given group
call) shall have priority over subsequent notifications (i.e. the messages for
an on-going group call) and must be sent as soon as possible;
NOTE 1: In addition initial notification messages for calls with or above an
operator defined priority level can be sent on all possible paging or access
grant channels to reduce the delay for those mobile stations which are not
using Discontinuous reception (DRX).
\- afterwards, an on-going group call in the cell shall be periodically
notified on the NCH.
Since the information for the establishment of a voice group call is sent onto
the NCH rather than on the PCH as for normal point-to-point calls, the mobile
station must listen to the PCH as well as to the NCH. A \"reduced NCH
monitoring\" mechanism can be used to save power in the mobile station when
listening to the NCH.
A mobile station able to receive voice group calls either, depending on the
implementation:
\- can use the \"reduced NCH monitoring\" mechanism. When entering a cell, the
mobile station shall listen to the NCH to get the notifications of the voice
group calls on-going in the cell. Afterwards, the mobile station needs to
listen to the NCH only if it is informed on the availability of a notification
for a new voice group call. This shall be based on the NCH status information
provided, as indicated in 3GPP TS 44.018;
\- do not apply the \"reduced NCH monitoring\" mechanism and read all possible
paging or access grant channels.
**b) Notifications for mobile stations in group mode dedicated channel, group
receive, group transmit or dedicated mode**
In addition to sending initial notification messages on the NCH for the voice
group call, the BSS can provide initial notification into on-going voice
broadcast, group calls and point to point calls informing mobile stations
partaking in these calls of new voice group calls that are being set-up in the
cell.
NOTE 2: The additional notification into on-going voice broadcast and group
calls and point to point calls should be provided by the BSS if the priority
level of the new call is equal or higher than the O&M defined priority level.
In order to do this the BSS sends initial notification messages on FACCH to
all other ongoing voice broadcast, group calls, and point to point calls in
the cell. The initial notification message on FACCH shall contain the group
call reference, the priority level if eMLPP applies, possibly the TCH
description which allows the mobile station to connect directly to the new
call without reading the NCH, and the emergency mode indication, if
applicable.
An indication of change of notifications in the current cell may be provided
on SACCH by the BSS.
When the emergency mode is set or reset for a voice group call ongoing in a
cell, the BSS shall send additional notifications on FACCH to all on-going
voice broadcast, group calls, and point-to-point calls in the respective cell.
As a mobile station option, the mobile station may read the NCH of the current
cell while in group mode dedicated channel, group receive, group transmit or
dedicated mode in order to be notified on other voice group calls.
NOTE 3: Mobile stations may require an additional receiver to read the NCH in
order to ensure a higher probability of receiving notifications for all
present voice group calls without degradation of the received speech quality.
Late entry of mobile stations into ongoing high priority group calls and voice
group calls in emergency mode is covered by the following mechanisms:
\- Late entrance in dedicated mode
If a mobile station in dedicated mode is moving into an area where a group
call (VGCS or VBS) with priority level equal or higher to an operator specific
setting or a voice group call in emergency mode is ongoing, the BSS shall
resend the notification message to the mobile station on FACCH, if the mobile
station has ASCI capabilities. This notification shall be triggered by
completion of the dedicated channel assignment.
Sending periodical notification on FACCH to the mobile station in dedicated
mode is optional, and is done as long as the group call (VGCS or VBS) with
priority level equal or higher to an operator specific setting, is ongoing or
as long as the emergency mode is set for the voice group call, with a
repetition period given by an operator specific setting.
\- Late entrance in group receive or group transmit mode
When a group call (VGCS or VBS) with priority level equal or higher to an
operator specific setting, is established, or when the emergency mode is set
for a voice group call, the BSS shall send periodical notification on FACCH to
all ongoing voice broadcast and group calls in the cell, except on the FACCH
of the group call (VGCS or VBS) which has initiated this periodical
notification. By this method the mobile station in group receive or group
transmit mode moving into this cell is notified. Periodical notification on
FACCH is done as long as the group call (VGCS or VBS) with priority level
equal or higher to an operator specific setting, is ongoing, or as long as the
emergency mode is set for the voice group call, with a repetition period given
by an operator specific setting.
NOTE 3a: The operator determined Periodical FACCH notification period shall be
a BSS specific operator setting and be a minimum of 1s and maximum of 5s.
**c) Paging into on-going voice group calls**
Paging into on-going voice group calls shall be provided as an implementation
option.
In addition to establishing the links for the voice group call, the network
can provide paging information into on-going voice group calls informing
mobile stations partaking in a voice group call of new incoming point-to-point
calls. The network can also provide paging information into ongoing voice
group calls informing mobile stations in group receive mode or group transmit
mode of incoming point-to-point short messages.
The mobile station shall be ready to receive a paging message on the FACCH
containing the mobile subscriber identity and the priority level if eMLPP
applies.
In the event of a reorganisation of the PCH the BSS shall inform the mobile
stations via the SACCH that paging reorganisation has occurred. A mobile
station receiving this indication shall decode the BCCH in order to obtain the
new paging configuration.
As a mobile station option, the mobile station may read its paging subchannel
in the current cell in group receive mode or group transmit mode in order to
receive paging messages.
NOTE 4: Mobile stations may require an additional receiver to read its PCH
subchannel in order to ensure a higher probability of receiving all relevant
paging messages without degradation of the received speech quality. The
additional receiver may be the same as used for reception of the NCH described
under b) above.
#### 11.3.1.4 Destination service subscribers
Mobile stations of destination service subscribers which are in idle mode
shall listen to notification messages on the NCH and move to the voice group
call channel or respond to the notification.
Mobile stations which are busy shall either pre-empt the current call (if
eMLPP is applied and the new call is of a sufficient priority), or shall
provide the service subscriber with an indication similar to call waiting,
when applicable.
If the mobile station supports group IDs with prefixes and has stored prefixes
for the group ID in the notification, the mobile station shall only react as
described previously in this subclause if the last digit of the group call
area ID included in the group call reference matches the default prefix or one
of the prefixes stored for the group ID. If the last digit of the group call
area ID does not match then the mobile station shall not react as described
previously in this subclause, but may still react by making an acknowledgement
as defined in subclause 4.2.5.
NOTE: In a network supporting the use of prefixes together with the group ID,
a mobile station not supporting the use of prefixes will react to notification
messages and can participate in any voice group call for a group ID for which
it has a subscription, regardless of any prefix used for setting up the voice
group call.
#### 11.3.1.5 Destination dispatchers
Destination dispatchers are connected into the voice group call as a standard
point-to-point call. The notification of the identity of the received group
call shall be supplied in the Calling Line Identity, formatted according to
sub-clause 9.2.
### 11.3.2 Call release
The voice group call can be terminated by the calling service subscriber or
the calling dispatcher clearing it down, or by any dispatcher nominated in the
GCR allowed to terminate the call.
#### 11.3.2.1 Call termination by the calling subscriber
The calling service subscriber will need to gain the uplink before he can
issue a termination request.
If the mobile station uses the uplink with a talker priority different from
\"normal subscriber\" it shall include this talker priority in the termination
request message. If the network supports uplink access option (i) as defined
in subclause 7.2 and A-interface link sharing applies, the MSC shall compare
the talker priority included in the termination request message with the
talker priority stored for the current talker. If they are equal, the
termination request is processed further; otherwise the MSC discards the
termination request message.
The MSC has to store the identity of the calling service subscriber and to
check it against the identity of the service subscriber which sends the voice
group call termination request. If they are equal, the MSC shall accept the
termination request and release all resources. On the radio interface a
channel release message shall be sent on the FACCH of all cells in the group
call area and then all resources are freed.
#### 11.3.2.2 Call termination by dispatchers
A dispatcher entitled to terminate the call can be a mobile subscriber or a
fixed line subscriber. The dispatcher may use out-of-band DTMF messages as a
means for the control of the call termination, if it is a mobile dispatcher.
The dispatcher may use , or DTMF tones or the signalling option specified in
ETSI TS 103 389 [19], if it is a fixed line dispatcher.
If the call is terminated by a mobile dispatcher using DTMF, the out-of-band
messages START_DTMF(X) and STOP_DTMF are sent via the radio interface towards
the network. If the out-of-band DTMF messages are sent by a mobile dispatcher
who is not controlled by the anchor MSC, the DTMF messages will be converted
by the controlling MSC (e.g. relay MSC or visited MSC) into DTMF tones and
these DTMF tones will be sent through the network to the anchor MSC.
If a fixed dispatcher initiates DTMF tones, the DTMF tones will be sent
through the network to the anchor MSC.
Both in case of a mobile and a fixed line dispatcher the anchor MSC is
responsible for the detection and collection of the out-of-band DTMF messages
or in-band signals. After the evaluation of the received information, the
anchor MSC shall trigger the appropriate function (see the figures 7b to 7d in
11.3.8).
In order to avoid the erroneous detection of the specific DTMF tone sequence
for call termination by the MSC, this sequence shall consist of at least three
DTMF digits.
#### 11.3.2.3 Call termination on expiry of no activity timer
A time-out mechanism is required such that, if the anchor MSC does not detect
any activity (as specified in subclause 8.1.2.3) within a pre-set time, the
call is terminated by the anchor MSC. For this a timer shall be provided with
a length as defined in the group call attributes in the GCR.
The network may provide an in-band indication, e.g. a tone, to inform the
participants of the group call about the forthcoming expiry of the \"no
activity\" timer.
### 11.3.3 Leaving of a dispatcher
A dispatcher can disconnect from the call at any time without terminating the
call. In order to terminate the call a dispatcher who is entitled to do this
must use the explicit signalling described in subclause 11.3.2.2.
### 11.3.4 Leaving and returning to a voice group call
A service subscriber shall automatically disconnect from the call when leaving
the group call area.
A service subscriber shall be able to disconnect from the voice group call by
a de-selection/re-selection process.
A mobile station shall leave the voice group call by no longer listening to
the voice group call downlink and returning to idle mode. A voice group call
is returned to by listening to the periodic notification messages for that
call, and reacting on them appropriately.
### 11.3.5 Cell change
#### 11.3.5.1 Listening subscriber
In all cases change of cell shall be initiated and performed by the service
subscriber\'s mobile station. In order for the service subscribers changing
from one cell to another within the group call area a cell list for the
neighbouring cells belonging to this group call area is periodically broadcast
on the downlink SACCH of the voice group call. In this case, mobile stations
entering a new cell shall perform cell change according to the algorithm C2,
see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 43.022.
Mobile stations which want to enter a cell shall listen to the BCCH and to the
NCH to determine which channel they shall retune to so that they can continue
with the voice group call if available in that cell.
NOTE: Mobile stations may require an additional receiver to read the BCCH and
NCH of the neighbour cells in order to ensure a higher probability of
receiving the relevant messages without degradation of the received speech
quality. The additional receiver may be the same as used in subclause
11.3.1.3.
Mobile stations entering a new location area shall perform location updating
as normal.
#### 11.3.5.2 Talking subscriber
Standard mobile station assisted handover shall be used for the cell change of
the talking service subscriber as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.
If the \"talker channel parameter\" indicates that the network shall always
establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the talking service subscriber,
the channel allocated by the network in the target cell shall always be a
dedicated channel.
If the network supports uplink access option (i) as defined in subclause 7.2,
collision cases between a handover of the talking service subscriber to a
voice group call channel and an uplink access message on the same group call
channel uplink shall be treated in the following way:
\- when the BSS allocates the handover resources for the talking service
subscriber, the BSS shall send an updated UPLINK BUSY message in the target
cell and no longer accept uplink access messages on this group call channel
uplink ;
\- when the BSS already granted the uplink to another subscriber , the BSS
shall delay the resource allocation for the handover of the current talker to
the same cell. If the MSC accepts the uplink request for the new talker , the
BSS shall cancel the handover resource allocation . Additionally, if the
current talker is served by the BSS, the BSS shall release the current talker.
Otherwise, if the MSC does not accept the uplink request for the new talker,
the BSS shall release the new talker and proceed with the handover of the
current talker.
If the talking subscriber leaves the group call area or enters a BSC area not
belonging to the service area, the uplink shall not be maintained by the
network.
If the BSS does not know if one or more of the target cells are outside the
group call area, the BSS shall use the MSC controlled handover procedure. The
MSC shall reject the handover in the case that all target cells are outside
the GCA and as an option release the uplink.
In a RANflex configuration with or without group call redundancy, if the
target cell belongs to a location area for which the group call serving MSC is
not the old cell\'s serving MSC, an inter MSC handover shall be performed.
#### 11.3.5.3 Dispatcher
Dispatchers which are mobile subscribers shall change the cell by standard
handover procedures.
### 11.3.6 New calls
Any service subscriber originated new voice group calls which have identical
group ID and group call area to on-going voice group calls shall be rejected
by the network with cause busy. The mobile station shall then read the
notifications for the corresponding group ID on the NCH.
For any dispatcher originated new voice group calls which are identical to on-
going voice group calls as described above the network shall include the
dispatcher in the on-going call.
Otherwise, new calls are treated as detailed in subclause 11.3.8. In the case
of congestion, voice group calls are treated according to their priority with
each BSC treating each downlink depending on the situation in each cell to
which the call is sent. Therefore, it is possible that a voice group call
might be established only in a subset of the required cells.
In the case where there are no conference bridges free, and pre-emption is not
performed, then the call request shall be rejected.
In the case of group members involved in group or point-to-point calls who
have been informed of a new voice group call, the mobile station shall make a
decision as to which to monitor as if both the on-going call and new call were
point-to-point calls, and follow the procedure defined in 3GPP TS 23.067.
### 11.3.7 Uplink and Downlink management
#### 11.3.7.1 Uplink transmission management
The downlink FACCH channel shall be used to indicate whether the uplink is in
use.
If a request to talk is made by the user and the uplink has been free the
mobile station shall start to transmit UPLINK_ACCESS messages as defined in
the 3GPP TS 44.018.
If the network supports the use of talker priorities, a mobile station
supporting the use of talker priorities may
\- send a request to talk even if an uplink busy indication is received, if
the talker priority of the new request is higher than the talker priority of
the current talking service subscriber; or
\- send an emergency mode reset request, if the emergency mode indication is
signalled by the network.
If a VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message is received by the mobile station with a
different request reference than that of the access made by the mobile
station, the mobile station shall not signal for a further 1 s.
If in this time the uplink becomes busy, and the network does not support the
use of talker priorities, the mobile station shall indicate to the user that
the access has been denied.
If in this time the uplink becomes busy, and the network indicates in the
UPLINK_BUSY message a talker priority equal or higher than the talker priority
used by the mobile station in the UPLINK_ACCESS message or
PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQUEST message, the mobile station shall indicate to the user
that the access has been denied; otherwise, it shall resend the UPLINK_ACCESS
message or PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQUEST message, respectively.
The user shall be provided with a short indication immediately after the
reception of the VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT which indicates that he can speak.
Contention caused by simultaneous access messages on the uplink of the voice
group call channel shall be resolved as for standard random access procedures.
If the uplink access is rejected a further indication shall be provided to the
user to inform him that his access attempt was not successful.
The network then shall send an UPLINK_BUSY message on the FACCH of the voice
group call channel downlink in all cells involved in the group call.
Signalling messages for call establishment and termination on the voice group
call channel shall then only apply for the mobile station currently using the
uplink. All other mobile stations shall not respond to this downlink
signalling. Once the request to talk is over, this shall be indicated to the
network by the mobile station, an UPLINK_FREE message is broadcast on all
FACCHs in the group call area.
If the network supports the use of talker priorities, the BSS shall include
the priority of the current talker in the UPLINK_BUSY message and shall repeat
the message on the FACCH every T1 seconds.
If the network supports uplink access option (i) as defined in subclause 7.2,
the BSS shall indicate in the UPLINK_BUSY message which channel shall be used
by service subscribers for an uplink request in the current cell. The
UPLINK_BUSY message can contain two different indications. The mobile station
of the service subscriber shall act:
\- according to the \"uplink access indication for talker priority\" when
signalling an uplink request with talker priority higher than \"normal
subscriber\" or an \"emergency mode reset request; or
\- according to the \"uplink access indication for data\" when signalling an
uplink request for sending application-specific data.
If both indications are included in the UPLINK_BUSY message, they should be
set to the same value.
If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used and indicates that the network
shall always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the talking
service subscriber, then the BSS shall set any uplink access indication
included in the uplink busy message (i.e. \"uplink access indication for
data\", \"uplink access indication for talker priority\", or both) to \"group
call channel uplink access\".
Otherwise, the BSS shall apply the following procedures:
> If the talking service subscriber uses the group call channel uplink in the
> current cell, the BSS shall indicate in the UPLINK_BUSY message that the
> RACH shall be used; otherwise it shall indicate that the group call channel
> uplink shall be used. The BSS shall immediately send an updated UPLINK_BUSY
> message:
\- in the handover target cell when the BSS allocates the resources for a
handover of the talking service subscriber to the voice group call channel in
the target cell;
\- in the handover target cell when BSS releases the resources allocated for
the handover of the talking service subscriber to the voice group call channel
in the target cell, because handover failed;
\- in the handover source cell after reception of a HANDOVER SUCCEEDED
message;
\- in the current cell after the talking service subscriber has been switched
within the cell from the group call channel to a dedicated channel or vice
versa.
When the BSS receives an indication from the MSC that the emergency mode is
set in the network, the BSS shall immediately send an UPLINK_BUSY message on
the FACCH and include also the \"emergency mode indication\".
If the BSS receives a VGCS Additional Info message from the MSC, an
ADDITIONAL_INFO message is broadcasted on the FACCHs of the voice group call
channel downlink in all cells involved in the current group call. If the BSS
receives the additional information in the UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD,
UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE or UPLINK_REJECT_CMD message then the BSS may
include the information in the UPLINK BUSY message instead of sending it in a
separate ADDITIONAL_INFO message on the group call channel downlink. The BSS
shall repeat the ADDITIONAL_INFO message on the SACCHs of the respective voice
group call channels every T2 seconds, until the uplink is released, or the BSS
receives an Uplink Release Command message or Uplink Seized Command message
for the respective voice group call from the MSC.
If the BSS receives a VGCS Additional Info message from the MSC and the
current talker on a dedicated channel is pre-empted by another service
subscriber with a higher talker priority, the BSS shall transmit the
additional information about the new talker also to the current talker when
releasing his dedicated channel.
#### 11.3.7.1a Transfer of a talking service subscriber to a dedicated
connection
The network may decide to switch a talking service subscriber\'s mobile
station from the voice group call channel to a dedicated standard
uplink/downlink at any time. The talking subscriber\'s voice group call
channel and the dedicated channel may belong to different cells within the
group call area, i.e. the network may request the talker to perform a
handover. The dedicated connection shall then be maintained up to the instance
where the network decides that the mobile station shall join the voice group
call channel again.
If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used and indicates that the network
shall always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the talking
service subscriber, a dedicated traffic channel shall be allocated to the
talking service subscriber. If there are not sufficient radio resources to
allocate a suitable dedicated channel in a cell within the group call area,
the MSC shall release the uplink of the voice group call channel used by the
talking service subscriber.
#### 11.3.7.1b Release of the dedicated transmission means of a talking
service subscriber
For the release of the dedicated transmission means of a talking service
subscriber the procedures specified in subclause 11.3.1.1.3 apply accordingly.
#### 11.3.7.2 Mute/Unmute downlink of the talker
This subclause applies to networks where the talking service subscriber may
use the voice group call channel. The handling of the Mute/Unmute requests by
the anchor MSC is shown in Figure 1a.
The mobile station of the talking service subscriber shall mute the downlink
to avoid non intelligible echoes when it is commanded by the network to mute
the downlink. On request of the dispatcher, the network can command the mobile
station of talking service subscriber to mute or unmute the downlink.
If a dispatcher originates a VGCS call, he is allowed to talk immediately when
the VGCS call is established. If a dispatcher joins or re-joins an ongoing
VGCS call, he is allowed to talk to the ongoing VGCS call at any time without
need to indicate this by any kind of signalling. If there is a talking service
subscriber using the uplink of the group call channel, he will not be able to
hear the dispatcher\'s voice.
If a dispatcher wishes to talk to the talking service subscriber and all
members of the ongoing group call, he shall indicate his wish by means of an
operator-defined operation. If the dispatcher has finished speaking, he shall
indicate this by means of another operator-defined operation. These operations
(via DTMF or the signalling option specified in ETSI TS 103 389 [19]) will
trigger the network to command the talking service subscriber's MS to mute or
unmute the downlink of voice group call channel.
When the network has detected a valid unmute request from a dispatcher it may
optionally indicate the recognition of this request by playing a "grant tone"
to be received by the requesting dispatcher only. The grant tone will be sent
in-band. The attributes of the grant tone (e.g. frequency and duration) are
network operator specific.
A dispatcher can be a mobile subscriber or a fixed line subscriber. The
dispatcher uses out-of-band DTMF messages if it is a mobile dispatcher. The
dispatcher uses DTMF tones or the signalling option specified in ETSI TS 103
389 [19], if it is a fixed line dispatcher. In case of a mobile dispatcher,
the out-of-band messages START_DTMF(X) and STOP_DTMF are sent via the radio
interface towards the network. If the out-of-band DTMF messages are sent by a
mobile dispatcher who is not controlled by the anchor MSC, the DTMF messages
will be converted by the controlling MSC (e.g. visited MSC) into DTMF tones
and these DTMF tones will be sent through the network to the anchor MSC. If a
fixed line dispatcher initiates DTMF tones, the DTMF tones will be sent
through the network to the anchor MSC.
NOTE: The transport of DTMF tones within the network is detailed in figures
7b, 7c and 7d.
Both for mobile and fixed line dispatchers the anchor MSC is responsible for
the detection and collection of the out-of-band or inband DTMF signals. After
the evaluation of the received information, the anchor MSC shall trigger the
appropriate action (i.e. send/not send the SET_PARAMETER message according to
previous paragraphs, playing of the optional grant tone).
The DTMF sequences used for signalling are implementation specific. These two
DTMF sequences shall not be the same.

### 11.3.7a Signalling procedures for the user plane
#### 11.3.7a.1 Group call re-establishment by the BSS
The MSC and BSC negotiate during the setup of a voice group call whether
\"group call re-establishment by the BSS\" is supported by both entities.
If \"group call re-establishment by the BSS\" is supported by both entities or
the network uses a transmission architecture with A-interface link sharing,
the following procedures apply:
i) If the BSS needs to release the group call channel in a cell due to an
equipment failure or another BSS-generated reason (e.g. preemption), the BSS
shall inform the MSC of the failure with either:
\- Uplink Release Indication and VGCS Assignment Status message if the group
call channel is serving the current talker; or
\- VGCS Assignment Status message if the group call channel is not serving the
current talker.
> The terrestrial resource for the group call channel is not released by the
> MSC.
ii) When the condition that caused the failure is subsequently removed, the
BSS shall re-allocate a radio resource for the group call channel and inform
the MSC of the recovery with a VGCS Assignment Status message.
iii) If A-interface link sharing is used, each of the VGCS ASSIGNMENT STATUS
messages in item (i) and (ii) shall be sent after expiry of timer Tast.
Otherwise, if \"group call re-establishment by the BSS\" is not supported by
both entities and the network does not use a transmission architecture with
A-interface link sharing, the following procedures apply:
i) If the BSS needs to release the group call channel in a cell due to an
equipment failure or another BSS-generated reason (e.g. preemption), the BSS
shall inform the MSC of the failure with either:
\- Uplink Release Indication if the group call channel is serving the current
talker; or
\- Clear Request if the group call channel is not serving the current talker.
ii) The MSC shall then initiate the clearing of the radio and terrestrial
resources for the group call channel. If supported, the MSC may retry the VGCS
Assignment procedure for the cell, depending on the reason for release.
Group call re-establishment by the BSS does not apply to the dedicated link of
the talker. If the BSS needs to release the dedicated channel of the talker
due to an equipment failure or another BSS-generated reason (e.g. preemption),
the BSS shall inform the MSC of the failure with an Uplink Release Indication.
The MSC shall then initiate the clearing of the radio and terrestrial
resources for the dedicated channel.
### 11.3.8 Overview of signalling
In this overview, the messages required to implement the specified concept are
identified, and brief details are given of each message.
A diagrammatic representation of the voice group call message structure
proposed and actions required are given in figures 2 to7j.
In order to simplify the message flows for voice group call establishment and
call termination, the interaction between the MSC and the GCR is only shown
for the MSC where the originator of the group call is located or, for the case
of a group call originated by a dispatcher, only for the anchor MSC. In all
cases, a similar interaction also takes place between the other MSC(s) and
associated GCR(s) involved in the group call.

message L3-MM CM SERVICE REQUEST sent on the allocated channel. Teleservice
Voice group call is indicated.
**UA (SERV_REQ):** This message is used to acknowledge the layer 2 link and
provide contention resolution of the service request.
**COM_L3_INFO:** The MSC is provided with initial information about the voice
group call.
NOTE 1: Messages flows for authentication and ciphering are not represented
although performed as normal.
**PROC_ACC_REQ:** The MAP_PROCESS_ACC_REQ message is sent to the VLR to check
the requested VGCS teleservice against the subscription data.
**PROC_ACC_ACK:** The MAP_PROCESS_ACC_ACK message acknowledges the requested
service.
**Authentication and Ciphering:** Authentication and Ciphering may be
performed. Acknowledgement of the service request can also be performed by
sending the CM SERVICE ACCEPT.
**SETUP:** The MSC is provided with details about the voice group call.
Optionally this message may contain a talker priority.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, an IMMEDIATE_SETUP may have been send as the initial
message including all details of the voice group call. In this case no SETUP
message must be sent.
**SEND_INFO_OUT:** The requested group ID is transferred to the VLR in the
MAP_SEND_INFO_FOR_OUTGOING_CALL message.
**COMPLETE_CALL:** The VLR returns the MAP_COMPLETE_CALL message confirming
the use of the requested group ID. The VLR also returns additional information
about the calling service subscriber, if available.
**GCR_INT:** The group call attributes are requested from the GCR through the
GCR Interrogation message sent by the MSC.
**GCR_INT_ACK:** The requested information is returned from the GCR in the GCR
Interrogation Ack message.
**ASSIGNMENT_REQUEST:** Standard message.
**CHAN_MOD_MODFY:** Standard message to modify the channel mode in case of
very early assignment.
**CHAN_MOD_MODFY_ACK:** Standard message to acknowledge the modification of
the channel mode.

NOTE 3: Alternatively, early assignment or OACSU procedures might be applied
with the corresponding assignment messages not presented in figure 2.
**VGCS_SETUP:** This message is sent from the MSC to all affected BSCs, [one
dedicated message for each BSC,] including the group call reference with the
eMLPP priority, and optionally the call priority.
**VGCS_SETUP_ACK:** Acknowledgement message from the affected BSC in answer to
the VGCS_SETUP message. If the setup is not successful, a VGCS_SETUP_REFUSE
message shall be sent instead.
**VGCS_ASSIGNMENT_REQ:** This message is sent from the MSC to all affected
BSCs, [one dedicated message for every requested channel in a cell] including
the group call reference, the channel type and possibly the call priority and
details on the ciphering.
In case of AoIP this message shall contain call identifier, codec list and
AoIP Transport layer address information.
NOTE 4: As an operator option the voice group call channels, the links to them
and optionally also the links to dispatchers can already be established and
permanently reserved in order to speed up the call set-up for emergency voice
group calls.
In case of A-interface link sharing this message shall contain a list of all
cells in the group call area served by this BSC. If the entire list of cell
identifiers does not fit into the message, one or more VGCS AREA CELL INFO
messages with additional cell identifier lists shall be sent. If the cell of
origin is served by this BSC, the cell shall be included in the VGCS
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
**VGCS_AREA_CELL_INFO:** This message shall contain the cell IDs that did not
fit into the VGCS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message in case of A-interface link
sharing.
**VGCS_ASSIGNMENT RESULT:** Acknowledgement message from the affected BSC in
answer to the assignment requests. If the assignment is not successful, a
VGCS_ASSIGNMENT_FAILURE message shall be sent instead.
In case of A-interface link sharing this message shall be sent as soon as a
channel could be established to the cell of origin or, if the cell of origin
is not served by this BSC, to any other cell. Then timer Tast shall be
started.
In case of AoIP this message shall contain AoIP Transport layer address, call
identifier and speech codec information.
**Tast:** In a network supporting A-interface link sharing timer Tast shall be
used to measure the duration between periodic reports from the BSC to the MSC
of Group Call Area cells for which channels have been assigned or released
since the last periodic report. When timer Tast expires, if new cells in the
Group Call Area have been established or existing ones have been released,
pre-empted or failed, the MSC shall be informed of the changes (see subclause
7.1b). Timer Tast shall be started again to measure the period of time until
the next report. The timer shall be stopped when the call is released.
**VGCS_ASSIGNMENT_STATUS:** This message shall be sent in case of A-interface
link sharing from the BSC to inform the MSC about the status of the channel
establishment to the cells of a given VGCS call. This message shall be sent
after timer Tast expires and new channels are established or existing channels
were released, pre-empted or failed. This message shall also be immediately
sent, and Tast restarted, when all cells for a given group call area served by
the BSC are established, indicating this.
**SETUP to fixed network users:** Based on the information determined about
the users of external networks to be involved in the call, the MSC shall
initiate calls to these users in the normal manner, depending on their mode of
connection into the MSC, and shall connect them into the conference bridge.
Alternatively normal calls to GSM subscribers may be established for
dispatchers being GSM subscribers which are not presented in the diagram.
**PREPARE_GROUP_CALL:** The group call attributes are sent to every relay MSC
and a Group Call number for call set-up to is requested.
**PREPARE_GROUP_CALL_ACK:** The Group Call number for call set-up is returned
to the anchor MSC.
**SETUP to MSC-R:** The ISUP connection is set-up to the relay MSC.
**CONNECT from MSC-R:** Set-up of the ISUP connection to the relay MSC is
confirmed.
**SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL:** Indicates to the anchor MSC that at least one
voice group call channel has been established in the relay MSC area.
**FORWARD_GROUP_CALL_SIGNALLING (IMSI, additional info):** The IMSI of the
service subscriber who has established the voice group call and who is allowed
to terminate the call is sent to every relay MSC. If the network supports the
use of talker priorities, the message includes also the talker priority.
Furthermore, the message provides additional information about the current
talking service subscriber, if available.
**Txx:** Timer implemented in the MSC which is started with receipt of the
SETUP message from the calling service subscriber. If the timer expires before
the conditions for establishment have been met, as per subclause 11.3.1.1.2,
then the call shall be released.
**NOTIF_REQ (NCH):** Messages for notification which contain the group call
reference, the priority of the call if eMLPP is applied, and possibly the
channel description of the voice group call channel to which the mobile
stations shall listen and the number of the group key used for ciphering.
**NOTIF_REQ (FACCH):** Message for notification sent on the FACCH to the
mobile stations currently involved in other calls. The notification on the
FACCH shall include the group call reference, and the priority level and may
also include the channel description and the group ciphering key numbers.
**UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD:** If the network supports the use of talker priorities,
this message informs the BSS about the talker priority of the current talking
service subscriber and about the status of the emergency mode. The MSC may
also include additional information about the current talking service
subscriber, if the information is available when sending this message.
**UPLINK_BUSY:** If the network supports the use of talker priorities, this
connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH to inform all mobile
stations about the talker priority of the current talking service subscriber
and about the status of the emergency mode. The network may also include
additional information about the current talking service subscriber, if the
information is available when sending this message and there is sufficient
space available in the message. The message is repeated on the FACCH every T1
seconds.
**VGCS_ADD_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the current
talking service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information was already
included in the UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD message.
**ADD_INFO:** The BSCs broadcast the additional information on the FACCH to
all listeners. , unless the information was already included in the
UPLINK_BUSY message
**Periodic ADD_ INFO (SACCH):** The message is repeated on the SACCH every T2
seconds.
**Periodic NOTIF_REQ (NCH):** The notifications are sent periodically so that
mobile stations moving into the area can join the voice group call.
**Periodic SACCH Info:** Periodic messages sent on SACCH. This message may
include:
\- information of changes of notifications;
\- information used for cell re-selection.
**CONNECT:** Information to the mobile station of the calling service
subscriber that the VGCS is established with the related group call reference
as the connected number. The CONNECT message is sent as soon as conditions for
establishment are met, as per subclause 11.3.1.1.2. If the SETUP message from
the calling subscriber contained a talker priority, the MSC returns the talker
priority used by the network. This will be lower than the requested talker
priority, if the subscription check for the requested talker priority was
unsuccessful.
**UPLINK_RELEASE:** When the calling service subscriber wants to become a
listening service subscriber for the first time, a message indicating release
of the uplink is required to be sent from the MS to the BSS in order to set
the uplink free.
NOTE 4a: For different cases of uplink release and the related message flows
refer to Figure 6.b to 6.g.
**UPLINK_RELEASE_INDICATION:** The BSS informs the MSC on the uplink release.
**FORWARD_GROUP_CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** This message is
sent to every relay MSC to indicate that the uplink is free.
**CLEAR COMMAND :** The MSC requests the BSS to clear radio and terrestrial
resources associated with originator dedicated link if not already done.
**CHAN_RELEASE:** The BSS sends a channel release message to the calling
service subscriber\'s mobile station including the channel description of the
voice group call channel to which the mobile station shall tune to.
NOTE 5: Alternatively, if no UPLINK_RELEASE has been sent to the network by
the mobile station, the network may transfer the mobile station to the voice
group call channel by the channel mode modify procedure or by an assignment
procedure or by a handover procedure.
**DISC:** Two layer 2 disconnect messages shall be sent by the mobile station
to the network.

conditions for establishment have been met, as per subclause 11.3.1.1.2, then
the call shall be released.
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** The anchor MSC
indicates to all relay MSCs that the uplink is free. On receipt of the uplink
free indication the relay MSC shall send an UPLINK RELEASE message to every
BSS of the group call area to indicate that the uplink free.
**UPLINK_REL_CMD and UPLINK_FREE:** After having received the VGCS SETUP ACK,
the MSC sends to BSCs the UPLINK RELEASE CMD in order to indicate that the
call has been initiated by a dispatcher. As a consequence, UPLINK FREE is sent
on the common channel(s). Then a service subscriber can request the uplink by
using Uplink Request procedure.
**NOTIF_REQ (NCH):** Messages for notification which contain the group call
reference, the priority of the call if eMLPP is applied, and possibly the
channel description of the voice group call channel to which the mobile
stations shall listen and the number of the group key used for ciphering.
**NOTIF_REQ (FACCH):** Message for notification sent on the FACCH to the
mobile stations currently involved in other calls. The notification on the
FACCH shall include the group call reference; and the priority level and may
also include the channel description and the group ciphering key numbers.
**CONNECT:** Information to the originating that the VGCS is established with
the related group call reference as the connected number.
**Periodic NOTIF_REQ (NCH):** The notifications are sent periodically so that
mobile stations moving into the area can join the voice group call.
**Periodic SACCH Info:** Periodic messages sent on SACCH. This message may
include:
\- information of changes of notifications;
> \- information used for cell re-selection.
Figure 3c: Signalling information required for establishing voice group calls\
by a service subscriber in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
**See also figure 3a**
**1\. SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO:** The V-MSC derives from the originating cell\'s
LAC the address of the group call serving MSC redundancy pool and sends
MAP_SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO to it, to retrieve the group call anchor MSC
redundancy pool address. Network routing shall be configured so that the
message is routed to one of the available MSCs within the redundancy pool. In
this example MSC-R1 is selected. The message includes initial talker
information.
**2\. GCR_INT:** MSC-R 1 requests from its associated GCR the group call
reference and group call anchor MSC redundancy pool address. The message may
contain initial talker information.
**3a. SYNC_GCR:** Initial Talker Information is propagated to all GCRs
associated to MSCs within the redundancy pool.
**3b. GCR_INT_ACK:** The requested information is returned from the GCR in the
GCR Interrogation Ack message. To avoid glare cases GCR 1 may need to wait for
message 5 before sending message 3b.
**4\. SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO_ACK:** The requested information is returned to the
visited MSC.
**5\. SYNC_GCR_ACK:** Successfull GCR synchronization is acknowledged.
**6\. SETUP to MSC-A:** Based on information received from the group call
serving MSC the VMSC shall set-up a dedicated connection for the calling
service subscriber to the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool. Network
routing shall be configured so that the message is routed to one of the
available MSCs within the redundancy pool. In this example MSC-A1 is selected.
The VGCS prefix plus group call reference shall be sent as calling party
number. The address of the calling service subscriber\'s group call serving
MSC pool shall be sent as generic number parameter, with the number qualifier
indicator set to \"additional calling party number\"; this shall be the same
address as used to route message 1.
**7\. GCR_INT:** MSC-A 1 requests from its associated GCR the group call
attributes and maks the group call \"on-going\".
**8a. SYNC_GCR:** The \"on-going\" indication is propagated to all GCRs
associated to MSCs within the redundancy pool.
**8b. GCR_INT_ACK:** The requested information is returned from the GCR in the
GCR Interrogation Ack message. To avoid glare cases GCR 3 may need to wait for
message 9 before sending message 8b.
**9\. SYNC_GCR_ACK:** Successfull GCR synchronization is acknowledged.
**10\. PREPARE_GROUP_CALL:** MSC-A 1 sends PREPARE_GROUP_CALL to the group
call relay MSC redundancy pool. Network routing shall be configured so that
the message is routed to one of the available MSCs within the redundancy pool.
In this example MSC-R2 is selected.
**11\. GCR_INT:** MSC-R 2 interrogates its associated GCR to retrieve the
group call attributes and initial talker information and to mark the group
call \"on-going\" and to delete the initial talker information.
**12a. SYNC_GCR:** The \"on-going\" indication is propagated to all GCRs
associated to MSCs within the redundancy pool.
**12b. GCR_INT_ACK:** The requested information is returned from the GCR in
the GCR Interrogation Ack message.
**13\. SYNC_GCR_ACK:** Successfull GCR synchronization is acknowledged.
**ALLOCATE GROUP CALL NUMBER (not shown in figure 8a):** MSC-R2 requests the
Group Call number from its associated VLR
**ALLOCATE GROUP CALL NUMBER ACK (not shown in figure 8a):** The Group Call
number is returned from the VLR.
**14\. PREPARE_GROUP_CALL_ACK:** The Group Call number is sent to MSC-A1.
**15\. SETUP from MSC-A1:** The ISUP connection is set-up between MSC-A1 and
MSC-R2 using the Group Call number received in step 14.
**RELEASE GROUP CALL NUMBER (not shown in figure 8a):** The VLR is requested
to release the Group Call number.
**16a. CONNECT to MSC-A:** Set-up of the ISUP connection from the anchor MSC
is confirmed.
**16b. SEND_GROUP CALL_END_SIGNAL (IMSI, additional info):** Indicates to the
anchor MSC that conversation can start. In addition the IMSI of calling
service subscriber who has established the voice group call and who is allowed
to terminate the call is included. If the network supports the use of talker
priorities, the message includes also the talker priority. Furthermore, the
message provides additional information about the current talking service
subscriber, if available. After sending message 16b MSC-R2 deletes initial
talker information (if any) as it may be invalid due to a lost race condition.
Valid initial talker information (if any) may be received with message 17b.
**17a. CONNECT (from MSC-A):** Call set-up of the dedicated connection for the
calling service subscriber is confirmed.
**17b. FORWARD_GROUP_CALL_SIGNALLING:** Initial Talker Information is
propagated from MSC-A to MSC-R.

Figure 4: Signalling information required for the voice group call uplink
access\ in the anchor MSC without talker priority (normal case, without
contention resolution)
**UPLINK_FREE:** This connectionless RR message is repeatedly sent by the BSS
on the main signalling link (FACCH) to inform all mobile stations of the voice
group call members that the uplink is free.
**UPLINK_ACCESS:** This is sent on the uplink of the voice group call channel
using random access procedures. The UPLINK_ACCESS message is similar to a
channel request but sent on the group call channel uplink. The establishment
cause for subsequent talker uplink request as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 shall
be used for this purpose. The mobile station may send repeated UPLINK_ACCESS
messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
**UPLINK_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink is indicated to the MSC. Only
one request per BSC shall be forwarded.
**VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the voice group
channel downlink containing information for synchronisation of the mobile
station to the network and uplink access contention resolution. The
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message shall therefore include a request reference
(reflecting the UPLINK_ACCESS) and the physical information required for
transmission on the voice group call channel uplink. On receipt of a
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT, the related mobile station can start to send speech
directly.
NOTE 11: UPLINK_FREE messages are stopped immediately.
**UPLINK_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH
to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy.
NOTE 12: The order of UPLINK_BUSY and SABM message is independent.
**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.
**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3 information
reflected for contention resolution.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The anchor MSC acknowledges the uplink to one
BSC. If uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC or MSC-R, all
remaining uplink requests shall be rejected by an UPLINK_REJECT_CMD which is
not presented in figure 4. On reception of an UPLINK_REJECT_CMD the BSS shall
send an UPLINK_REL to the related mobile station, followed by an UPLINK_BUSY
to indicate to the mobile stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC shall
send to other BSCs which did not send an uplink request an UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD
message which is not presented in figure 4. On reception of an
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK_BUSY to indicate to the mobile
stations that the uplink is in use.
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink seized command):** This message is
sent to all relay MSCs, to inform all mobile stations roaming in parts of the
group call area which are controlled by relay MSCs, that the uplink is now
busy.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_CONFIRM:** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the MSC
together with the mobile station identity.
> NOTE 12a**:** In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
> redundancy) the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different from
> his current location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case the
> retrieval of info from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP service
> SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
**VGCS_ADD_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new talking
service subscriber to all BSCs. The BSCs broadcast ADD_INFO messages
containing the additional information to all listeners (not shown in figure
4).
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (additional info):** This message is sent to
all relay MSCs to provide information about the new talking service
subscriber.
**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the uplink,
it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of the conference
bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all appropriate downlink
channels.
**UPLINK_RELEASE:** When the service subscriber who has access to the uplink
wants to release the channel, then a message indicating release of the uplink
is required to be sent from the MS to the BSS on the FACCH.
NOTE 12b: For different cases of uplink release and the related message flows
refer to Figure 6.b to 6.g.
**UPLINK_RELEASE_INDICATION:** The BSS informs the MSC on the uplink release.
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** The anchor MSC
indicates to all relay MSCs that the uplink is free. On receipt of the uplink
free indication the relay MSC shall send an UPLINK RELEASE message to every
BSS of the group call area to indicate that the uplink free.

NOTE: The figure describes the handling, if MSC decides to have a subsequent
talker on a dedicated channel.
Figure 4a: Signalling information required for the voice group call uplink
access\ in the anchor MSC with talker priority \"privileged subscriber\"
(normal case, without contention resolution, subsequent talker on dedicated
channel)
**UPLINK_FREE:** This connectionless RR message is repeatedly sent by the BSS
on the main signalling link (FACCH) to inform all mobile stations of the voice
group call members that the uplink is free.
**UPLINK_ACCESS:** This is sent on the uplink of the voice group call channel
using random access procedures. The UPLINK_ACCESS message is similar to a
channel request but sent on the group call channel uplink. The establishment
cause for a privileged subscriber request as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 shall
be used for this purpose. The mobile station may send repeated UPLINK_ACCESS
messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
**VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the voice group
channel downlink containing information for synchronisation of the mobile
station to the network and uplink access contention resolution. The
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message shall therefore include a request reference
(reflecting the UPLINK_ACCESS) and the physical information required for
transmission on the voice group call channel uplink. On receipt of a
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT, the related mobile station can start to send speech
directly.
NOTE 13: UPLINK_FREE messages are stopped immediately.
**UPLINK_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH
to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy. If the network
supports talker priorities, then the UPLINK_BUSY indicates the talker priority
of the current talking service subscriber to all listening service subscribers
and additionally, if the emergency mode is set in the network, the emergency
mode indication. The message is repeated on the FACCH every T1 seconds.
NOTE 14: The order of UPLINK_BUSY and SABM message is independent.
**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.
**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3 information
reflected for contention resolution.
NOTE 15: Dedicated signalling connection on the main DCCH needs to be
established.
**UPLINK_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink containing the MS identity and
the talker priority is indicated to the MSC. Only one request per BSS shall be
forwarded.
NOTE 16: As the BSS supports the use of talker priorities and receives from
the MS a talker priority different from \"normal subscriber\", the BSS delays
the sending of the UPLINK_REQUEST message to the MSC, until SABM(L3msg) with
the MS identity is received from the MS. Then the BSS includes the layer 3
message, the talker priority, and the cell identity of the cell where the
UPLINK_ACCESS message was received in the UPLINK_REQUEST message. In this case
the UPLINK_REQUEST_CONFIRM message may be omitted by the BSS.
NOTE 16a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy)
the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different from his current
location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case the retrieval of info
from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP service
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The anchor MSC acknowledges the uplink to one
BSC. If uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC or MSC-R, all
remaining uplink requests shall be rejected by an UPLINK_REJECT_CMD which is
not presented in figure 4a. On reception of an UPLINK_REJECT_CMD the BSS shall
send an UPLINK_REL to the related mobile station, followed by an UPLINK_BUSY
to indicate to the mobile stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC shall
send to other BSCs which did not send an uplink request an UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD
message which is not presented in figure 4a. On reception of an
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK_BUSY to indicate to the mobile
stations that the uplink is in use.
The anchor MSC may also include additional information about the new talking
service subscriber in the UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE, UPLINK_REJECT_CMD and
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD messages, if the information is available when sending these
messages. The BSS may include the additional information in the UPLINK_BUSY
messages, if the information is available when sending these messages and
there is sufficient space available in the messages.
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink seized command, privileged subscriber,
additional info):** This message is sent to all relay MSCs, to inform all
mobile stations roaming in parts of the group call area which are controlled
by relay MSCs that the uplink is now busy for a talker with talker priority
\"privileged subscriber\". Furthermore, the message provides additional
information about the new talking service subscriber, if available.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_CONFIRM:** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the MSC
together with the mobile station identity.
**ASS_REQ** : This message contains details of the resource(s) required for
the dedicated connection.
**ASSIGNMENT_CMD** : This message contains details of the resource(s) required
and triggers the assignment procedure of the dedicated channel at the MS.
**ASSIGNMENT_COMP** : Standard message.
**ASS_COMP** : Standard message.
**VGCS_ADD_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new talking
service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information was already included in
the UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE, UPLINK_REJECT_CMD and UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD
messages. The BSCs broadcast ADD_INFO messages containing the additional
information to all listeners (not shown in figure 4a) , unless the information
was already included in the UPLINK_BUSY messages.
**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the uplink,
it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of the conference
bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all appropriate downlink
channels.
**UPLINK_RELEASE:** When the service subscriber who has access to the uplink
wants to release the channel, then a message indicating release of the uplink
is required to be sent from the MS to the BSS on the FACCH.
NOTE 17: For different cases of uplink release and the related message flows
refer to Figure 6b to 6g.
**UPLINK_RELEASE_INDICATION:** The BSS informs the MSC of the uplink release.
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** The anchor MSC
indicates to all relay MSCs that the uplink is free. On receipt of the uplink
free indication the relay MSC shall send an UPLINK RELEASE message to every
BSS of the group call area to indicate that the uplink free.

be used for this purpose. The mobile station may send repeated UPLINK_ACCESS
messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
**VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the voice group
channel downlink containing information for synchronisation of the mobile
station to the network and uplink access contention resolution. The
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message shall therefore include a request reference
(reflecting the UPLINK_ACCESS) and the physical information required for
transmission on the voice group call channel uplink. On receipt of a
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT, the related mobile station can start to send speech
directly.
**UPLINK_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH
to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy. UPLINK_BUSY
indicates the talker priority \"emergency subscriber\" of the new talking
service subscriber to all listening service subscribers.
NOTE 18: The order of UPLINK_BUSY and SABM message is independent.
**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.
**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3 information
reflected for contention resolution.
NOTE 19: Dedicated signalling connection on the main DCCH needs to be
established.
**UPLINK_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink containing the MS identity and
the talker priority is indicated to the MSC. Only one request per BSS shall be
forwarded.
NOTE 20: As the BSS supports the use of talker priorities and receives from
the MS a talker priority different from \"normal subscriber\", the BSS delays
the sending of the UPLINK_REQUEST message to the MSC, until SABM(L3msg) with
the MS identity is received from the MS. Then the BSS includes the layer 3
message, the talker priority, and the cell identity of the cell where the
UPLINK_ACCESS message was received in the UPLINK_REQUEST message. In this case
the UPLINK_REQUEST_CONFIRM message may be omitted by the BSS.
NOTE 20a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy)
the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different from his current
location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case the retrieval of info
from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP service
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The anchor MSC acknowledges the uplink to one
BSC, including the talker priority and the emergency mode indication. If
uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC or MSC-R, all remaining
uplink requests shall be rejected by an UPLINK_REJECT_CMD with an emergency
mode indication (not presented in figure 4b). On reception of an
UPLINK_REJECT_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK_REL to the related mobile
station, followed by an UPLINK_BUSY to indicate to the mobile stations that
the uplink is in use. The MSC shall send to other BSCs which did not send an
uplink request an UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD message with an emergency mode indication
(not presented in figure 4b). On reception of an UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD the BSS
shall send an UPLINK_BUSY to indicate to the mobile stations that the uplink
is in use.
The anchor MSC may also include additional information about the new talking
service subscriber in the UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE, UPLINK_REJECT_CMD and
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD messages, if the information is available when sending these
messages. The BSS may include the additional information in the UPLINK_BUSY
messages, if the information is available when sending these messages and
there is sufficient space available in the messages.
**UPLINK_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH
to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy with talker priority
\"emergency subscriber\" and that the emergency mode is set in the network.
The message is repeated on the FACCH every T1 seconds.
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink seized command, emergency subscriber,
add info):** This message is sent to all relay MSCs, to inform all mobile
stations roaming in parts of the group call area which are controlled by relay
MSCs, that the uplink is now busy for a talker with talker priority
\"emergency subscriber\" and that the emergency mode indication shall be
signalled. Furthermore, the message provides additional information about the
new talking service subscriber, if available.
**ASS_REQ** : This message contains details of the resource(s) required for
the dedicated connection.
**ASSIGNMENT_CMD** : This message contains details of the resource(s) required
and triggers the assignment procedure of the dedicated channel at the MS.
**ASSIGNMENT_COMP** : Standard message.
**ASS_COMP** : Standard message.
**VGCS_ADD_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new talking
service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information was already included in
the UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE, UPLINK_REJECT_CMD and UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD
messages. The BSCs broadcast ADD_INFO messages containing the additional
information to all listeners (not shown in figure 4b) , unless the information
was already included in the UPLINK_BUSY messages.Additionally, the MSC sends
the additional information on the dedicated connection for the previous
talker, before this connection is released.
**CLEAR COMMAND:** The MSC requests the BSS to clear radio and terrestrial
resources associated with previous talker.
**CLEAR_COMP** : Standard message.
**CHAN_RELEASE:** The BSS sends a channel release message to the previous
talker\'s mobile station including the channel description of the voice group
call channel to which the mobile station shall tune to. Additionally the BSS
includes the talker priority of the new talker and the additional information,
if available, and the emergency mode indication, if applicable.
**DISC:** Two layer 2 disconnect messages shall be sent by the mobile station
to the network.
**SCCP_RLSD** : Standard message.
**SCCP_RLC** : Standard message.
**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the uplink,
it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of the conference
bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all appropriate downlink
channels.

Figure 4c: Signalling information required for the voice group call uplink
access\ in the anchor MSC with \"emergency mode reset request\"
**UPLINK_ACCESS:** This is sent on the uplink of the voice group call channel
using random access procedures. The UPLINK_ACCESS message is similar to a
channel request but sent on the group call channel uplink. The establishment
cause for emergency mode reset request as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 shall be
used for this purpose.
**EMERGENCY_RESET_IND:** The reception of an emergency mode reset request is
indicated to the MSC. Only one request per BSC shall be forwarded.
NOTE 21: The BSS delays the sending of the EMERGENCY_RESET_IND message to the
MSC, until SABM(L3msg) with the MS identity is received from the MS. Then the
BSS includes the layer 3 message and the cell identity of the cell where the
UPLINK_ACCESS message was received in the EMERGENCY_RESET_IND message.
NOTE 21a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy)
the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different from his current
location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case the retrieval of info
from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP service
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
**VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the voice group
channel downlink containing information for synchronisation of the mobile
station to the network and uplink access contention resolution. The
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message shall therefore include a request reference
(reflecting the UPLINK_ACCESS) and the physical information required for
transmission on the voice group call channel uplink.
**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.
**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3 information
reflected for contention resolution.
**UPLINK_RELEASE:** When the BSS has forwarded the emergency mode reset
request it releases the layer 2 link. A message indicating release of the
uplink is required to be sent from the BSS to the MS on the FACCH.
**EMERGENCY_RESET_COMMAND:** The anchor MSC commands all BSCs involved in the
voice group call to reset the emergency mode. If the BSC receives an
EMERGENCY_RESET_COMMAND message, it changes the content of the NCH to indicate
\"no emergency mode\" and the talker priority of the current talking service
subscriber to \"normal subscriber\", if the previous uplink status was uplink
busy with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\".
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (emergency mode reset command):** This message
is sent to all relay MSCs, to inform all BSCs controlled by relay MSCs that
the emergency mode indication shall not be sent any longer and that the talker
priority of the current talking service subscriber is changed to \"normal
subscriber\", if the previous uplink status was uplink busy with talker
priority \"emergency subscriber\".
**UPLINK_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH
to inform all mobile stations that the voice group call is no longer in
emergency mode and that the talker priority was changed to \"normal
subscriber\", if the previous uplink status was uplink busy with talker
priority \"emergency subscriber\". The message is repeated on the FACCH every
T1 seconds.
**Conversation proceeds:** The conversation of the current talker is not
interrupted.

Figure 4d: Signalling information required for the voice group call uplink
request via RACH with talker priority \"privileged subscriber\" in the anchor
MSC and pre-emption of the current talker (normal case, without contention
resolution)
**RACH(CHAN_REQ):** Standard message to request an SDCCH.
**IMM_ASS:** Standard message sent on the AGCH.
**SABM (PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQ):** L3 message PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQ sent on the
allocated channel.
**UA (PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQ):** This message is used to acknowledge the layer 2
link and provide contention resolution of the priority uplink request.
**UPLINK_BUSY (not presented in figure 4d):** If validation of Priority Uplink
Requests applies for the group call, the BSS, on receipt of a valid Priority
Uplink Request, shall send an UPLINK_BUSY on the downlink FACCH to inform all
mobile stations that a priority request has been made and to provide a new
token. The message is sent on Tbb expiry.
**CHAN_RELEASE:** The BSS sends a channel release message to the service
subscriber\'s mobile station.
**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.
**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link.
**UPLINK_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink containing the MS identity and
the talker priority is indicated to the MSC. Only one request per BSS shall be
forwarded.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE (privileged subscriber):** The anchor MSC
acknowledges the uplink to one BSC. If uplink requests have been made by more
than one BSC or MSC-R, all remaining uplink requests shall be rejected by an
UPLINK_REJECT_CMD which is not presented in figure 4d. On reception of an
UPLINK_REJECT_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK_REL to the related mobile
station, followed by an UPLINK_BUSY to indicate to the mobile stations that
the uplink is in use. The MSC shall send to other BSCs which did not send an
uplink request an UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD message which is not presented in figure
4d. On reception of an UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK_BUSY to
indicate to the mobile stations that the uplink is in use.
The anchor MSC may also include additional information about the new talking
service subscriber in the UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE, UPLINK_REJECT_CMD and
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD messages, if the information is available when sending these
messages. The BSS may include the additional information in the UPLINK_BUSY
messages, if the information is available when sending these messages and
there is sufficient space available in the messages.
**UPLINK_RELEASE:** Upon receipt of an UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE, UPLINK_REJ
or UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD indicating the talker priority of the new talker, the BSC
releases the current talker from the uplink by sending a message requesting
release of the uplink to the mobile station on the FACCH.
**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.
**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link.
NOTE 21b: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy)
the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different from his current
location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case the retrieval of info
from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP service
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink seized command, privileged subscriber,
add info):** This message is sent to all relay MSCs, to inform all mobile
stations roaming in parts of the group call area which are controlled by relay
MSCs, that the uplink is now busy for a talker with talker priority
\"privileged subscriber\". Furthermore, the message provides additional
information about the new talking service subscriber, if available.
**VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT:** The reply to the priority uplink request sent on the
voice group channel downlink containing information for synchronisation of the
mobile station to the network and uplink access contention resolution. The
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message shall therefore include a request reference
(reflecting the PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQUEST) and the physical information required
for transmission on the voice group call channel uplink. On receipt of a
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT, the related mobile station can start to send speech
directly.
**UPLINK_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH
to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy. If the network
supports talker priorities, then the UPLINK_BUSY indicates the talker priority
of the current talking service subscriber to all listening service subscribers
and additionally, if the emergency mode is set in the network, the emergency
mode indication. The message is repeated on the FACCH every T1 seconds. If
validation of Priority Uplink Requests applies each periodic UPLINK_BUSY
message shall include a new token (i.e. a new token is broadcast every T1
seconds).
NOTE: The order of UPLINK_BUSY and SABM message is independent.
**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.
**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3 information
reflected for contention resolution.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_CONFIRM:** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the MSC
together with the mobile station identity, classmark information and
optionally the CKSN.
**VGCS_ ADD_ INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new
talking service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information was already
included in the UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE, UPLINK_REJECT_CMD and
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD messages. The BSCs broadcast ADD_INFO messages containing
the additional information to all listeners (not shown in figure 4d) , unless
the information was already included in the UPLINK_BUSY messages.
**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the uplink,
it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of the conference
bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all appropriate downlink
channels.

**EMERGENCY_RESET_IND:** The reception of an emergency mode reset request is
indicated to the MSC. Only one request per BSS shall be forwarded.
**EMERGENCY_RESET_COMMAND:** The anchor MSC commands all BSCs involved in the
voice group call to reset the emergency mode. If the BSC receives an
EMERGENCY_RESET_COMMAND message, it changes the content of the NCH to indicate
\"no emergency mode\" and the talker priority of the current talking service
subscriber to \"normal subscriber\", if the previous uplink status was uplink
busy with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\".
NOTE 21c: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy)
the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different from his current

Figure 5: Signalling information required for the voice group call uplink
access\ in the relay MSC without talker priority (normal case, without
contention resolution)
**UPLINK_FREE:** This connectionless RR message is repeatedly sent by the BSS
on the main signalling link (FACCH) to inform all mobile stations of the voice
group call members that the uplink is free.
**UPLINK_ACCESS:** This is sent on the uplink of the voice group call channel
using random access procedures. The UPLINK_ACCESS message is similar to a
channel request but sent on the group call channel uplink. The establishment
cause for subsequent talker uplink request as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 shall
be used for this purpose. The mobile station may send repeated UPLINK_ACCESS
messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
**UPLINK_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink is indicated to the MSC. Only
one request per BSC shall be forwarded.
NOTE 22: If the BSS supports the use of talker priorities and receives from
the MS a talker priority different from \"normal subscriber\", the BSS delays
the sending of the UPLINK_REQUEST message to the MSC, until SABM(L3msg) is
received from the MS. Then the BSS includes the layer 3 message, the talker
priority, and the cell identity of the cell where the UPLINK_ACCESS message
was received in the UPLINK_REQUEST message. In this case the
UPLINK_REQUEST_CONFIRM message may be omitted by the BSS.
**VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the voice group
channel downlink containing information for synchronisation of the mobile
station to the network and uplink access contention resolution. The
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message shall therefore include a request reference
(reflecting the UPLINK_ACCESS) and the physical information required for
transmission on the voice group call channel uplink. On receipt of a
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT, the related mobile station can start to send speech
directly.
NOTE 23: UPLINK_FREE messages are stopped immediately.
**UPLINK_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH
to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy.
NOTE 24: If the BSS supports the use of talker priorities, then it indicates
the talker priority of the current talking service subscriber and the status
of the emergency mode in the UPLINK_BUSY message and repeats the message on
the FACCH every T1 seconds.
NOTE 25: The order of UPLINK_BUSY and SABM message is independent.
**SABM (L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.
**UA (L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3 information
reflected for contention resolution.
**PROCESS_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink request):** This message is sent to
the anchor MSC, to indicate that the uplink is requested by a subscriber
roaming in the relay MSC area.
NOTE 26: If the UPLINK_REQUEST message contained the layer 3 message, the
message provides additional information about the new talking service
subscriber, if available.
**FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink request ack):** This message is sent
to the relay MSC, to indicate that the uplink is granted to the mobile station
roaming in parts of the group call area which are controlled by relay MSC.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The relay MSC acknowledges the uplink to one
BSC. If uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC, all remaining
uplink requests shall be rejected by an UPLINK_REJECT_CMD which is not
presented in figure 5. On reception of an UPLINK_REJECT_CMD the BSS shall send
an UPLINK_REL to the related mobile station, followed by an UPLINK_BUSY to
indicate to the mobile stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC shall send
to other BSCs which did not send an uplink request an UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD
message which is not presented in figure 5. On reception of an
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK_BUSY to indicate to the mobile
stations that the uplink is in use. If the BSS supports the use of talker
priorities, then it indicates the talker priority of the current talking
service subscriber and the status of the emergency mode in the UPLINK_BUSY
message and repeats the message on the FACCH every T1 seconds.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_CONFIRM :** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the MSC
together with the mobile station identity.
NOTE 26a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy)
the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different from his current
location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case the retrieval of info
from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP service
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
**VGCS_ADD_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new talking
service subscriber to all BSCs. The BSCs broadcast ADD_INFO messages
containing the additional information to all listeners (not shown in figure
5).
**PROCESS_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (additional info):** This message is sent to
the anchor MSC to provide information about the new talking service
subscriber. The anchor MSC forwards the message to all other relay MSCs.
NOTE 27: This message is omitted, if the additional info was already included
in the PROCESS_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink request) message.
**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the uplink,
it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of the conference
bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all appropriate downlink
channels.
**UPLINK_RELEASE:** When the service subscriber who has access to the uplink
wants to release the channel, then a message indicating release of the uplink
is required to be sent from the MS to the BSS on the FACCH.
NOTE 28: For different cases of uplink release and the related message flows
refer to Figure 6.b to 6.g.
**UPLINK_RELEASE_INDICATION:** The BSS informs the MSC on the uplink release.
**PROCESS_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** The relay MSC
indicates to the anchor MSC that the uplink is free.

Figure 5a: Signalling information required for the voice group call uplink
request via RACH with talker priority \"privileged subscriber\" in the relay
MSC (normal case, without contention resolution)
**RACH(CHAN_REQ):** Standard message to request an SDCCH.
**IMM_ASS:** Standard message sent on the AGCH.
**SABM (PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQ):** L3 message PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQ sent on the
allocated channel.
**UA (PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQ):** This message is used to acknowledge the layer 2
link and provide contention resolution of the service request.
**CHAN_RELEASE:** The BSS sends a channel release message to the service
subscriber\'s mobile station.
**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.
**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link.
**UPLINK_BUSY (not presented in figure 5a):** If validation of Priority Uplink
Requests applies for the group call, the BSS, on receipt of a valid Priority
Uplink Request, shall send an UPLINK_BUSY on the downlink FACCH to inform all
mobile stations that a priority request has been made and to provide a new
token. The message is sent on Tbb expiry.
**UPLINK_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink is indicated to the MSC. Only
one request per BSS shall be forwarded.
NOTE 28a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy)
the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different from his current
location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case the retrieval of info
from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP service
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
**PROCESS_GROUP_CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink request, privileged subscriber, add
info):** This message is sent to the anchor MSC, to indicate that the uplink
is requested by a subscriber with talker priority \"privileged subscriber\"
roaming in the relay MSC area. Furthermore, the message provides additional
information about the service subscriber requesting the uplink, if additional
information is available.
**FORWARD_GROUP_CALL_SIGNALLING (uplink request ack):** This message is sent
to the relay MSC, to indicate that the uplink is granted to the mobile station
roaming in parts of the group call area which are controlled by the relay MSC.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The relay MSC acknowledges the uplink to one
BSC. If uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC, all remaining
uplink requests shall be rejected by an UPLINK_REJECT_CMD which is not
presented in figure 5a. On reception of an UPLINK_REJECT_CMD the BSS shall
send an UPLINK_REL to the related mobile station, followed by an UPLINK_BUSY
to indicate to the mobile stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC shall
send to other BSCs which did not send an uplink request an UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD
message which is not presented in figure 5a. On reception of an
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK_BUSY to indicate to the mobile
stations that the uplink is in use.
The anchor MSC may also include additional information about the new talking
service subscriber in the UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE, UPLINK_REJECT_CMD and
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD messages, if the information is available when sending these
messages.
**UPLINK_RELEASE:** Upon receipt of an UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK_REJECT_CMD or UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD indicating the talker priority of the
new talker, the BSC releases the current talker from the uplink by sending a
message requesting release of the uplink to the mobile station on the FACCH.
**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.
**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link.
**VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT:** The reply to the priority uplink request sent on the
voice group channel downlink containing information for synchronisation of the
mobile station to the network and uplink access contention resolution. The
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT message shall therefore include a request reference
(reflecting the PRIORITY_UPLINK_REQUEST) and the physical information required
for transmission on the voice group call channel uplink. On receipt of a
VGCS_UPLINK_GRANT, the related mobile station can start to send speech
directly.
**UPLINK_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH
to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy. If the network
supports talker priorities, then the UPLINK_BUSY indicates the talker priority
of the current talking service subscriber to all listening service subscribers
and additionally, if the emergency mode is set in the network, the emergency
mode indication. The message is repeated on the FACCH every T1 seconds. If
validation of Priority Uplink Requests applies each periodic UPLINK_BUSY
message shall include a new token (i.e. a new token is broadcast every T1
seconds). The BSS may include the additional information about the new talking
service subscriber in the UPLINK_BUSY message, if the information is available
when sending this message and there is sufficient space available in the
message.
NOTE: The order of UPLINK_BUSY and SABM message is independent.
**SABM (L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.
**UA (L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3 information
reflected for contention resolution.
**UPLINK_REQUEST_CONFIRM:** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the MSC
together with the mobile station identity, classmark information and
optionally the CKSN.
**VGCS_ ADD_ INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new
talking service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information was already
included in the UPLINK_REQUEST_ACKNOWLEDGE, UPLINK_REJECT_CMD and
UPLINK_SEIZED_CMD messages. The BSCs broadcast ADD_INFO messages containing
the additional information to all listeners (not shown in figure 5a) , unless
the information was already included in the UPLINK_BUSY messages.
**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the uplink,
it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of the conference
bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all appropriate downlink
channels.
Figure 5b: Signalling information required when the talker is attached to the
Anchor MSC and a dispatcher sends DTMF signals
**Conversation proceeds:** The talker is in control of the uplink (see figure
4) and is attached to the Anchor MSC. The mobile station's downlink is muted
to prevent any distracting echo being heard by the mobile station user.
**DTMF Tones (start_talking) or DTMF message (start_talking):** This
signalling indicates the dispatcher's unmute request to the MSC. DTMF Tones
are used by a fixed line dispatcher while the DTMF message is used by a mobile
dispatcher.
**Grant Tone:** The Anchor MSC may optionally play an in-band tone to the
dispatcher to indicate that the dispatcher's request is recognized and that
the downlink of the talking service subscriber will be unmuted The attributes
of the grant tone (e.g. frequency and duration) are network operator
specific..
**Set Parameter (D-ATT = TRUE):** The Anchor MSC sends this message to the
mobile station to unmute the downlink so that the user can hear what the
dispatcher says.
NOTE 29: This message is sent only when the downlink of the talker is muted.
**DTMF Tones (end_talking) or DTMF message (end_talking):** This signalling
indicates the dispatcher's mute request to the MSC. DTMF Tones are used by a
fixed line dispatcher while the DTMF message is used by a mobile dispatcher.
**Set Parameter (D-ATT = FALSE):** Once the dispatcher indicates that he has
finished speaking, the Anchor MSC mutes the talker's downlink.
NOTE 30: This message is only sent when all dispatchers who have sent the
unmuting request have finished their talk.
Figure 5c: Signalling information required when the talker is attached to a
Relay MSC and a dispatcher sends DTMF signals
**Conversation proceeds:** The talker is in control of the uplink (see figure
4) and is attached to a Relay MSC. The mobile station's downlink is muted to
prevent any distracting echo being heard by the mobile station user.
**DTMF Tones (start_talking or DTMF message (start_talking):** This signalling
indicates the dispatcher's unmute request to the MSC. DTMF Tones are used by a
fixed line dispatcher while the DTMF message is used by a mobile dispatcher.
**Grant Tone:** The Anchor MSC may optionally play an in-band tone to the
dispatcher to indicate that the dispatcher's request is recognized and that
the downlink of the talking service subscriber will be unmuted. The attributes
of the grant tone (e.g. frequency and duration) are network operator specific.
**FORWARD_GROUP_CALL_SIGNAL:** This message is sent to the Relay MSC when
anchor MSC wants to change the mute/unmute status of the talking service
subscriber. In this case **stateAttributes::DA = TRUE** , is set.
**Set Parameter (D-ATT = TRUE/FALSE):** The Relay MSC sends this message to
the talker when a FORWARD GROUP CALL SIGNAL containing a STATE_ATTRIBUTES
information element is received. The D-ATT field is set as received in
STATE_ATTRIBUTES element.
**DTMF Tones (end_talking) or DTMF message (end_talking):** This signalling
indicates the dispatcher's mute request to the MSC. DTMF Tones are used by a
fixed line dispatcher while the DTMF message is used by a mobile dispatcher.
**FORWARD_GROUP_CALL_SIGNAL:** This message is sent to the Relay MSC when the
anchor MSC wants to change the mute/unmute status of the talking service
subscriber. In this case **stateAttributes::DA = FALSE** is set.
**Set Parameter (D-ATT = FALSE):** Once the dispatcher indicates that he has
finished speaking, the MSC mutes the talker's downlink again.
Figure 5d: Signalling information required when the talker is attached to the
Anchor MSC and a mobile dispatcher who is roaming in a non-Anchor MSC area
sends DTMF signals
**Conversation proceeds:** The talker is in control of the uplink (see figure
4) and is attached to the Anchor MSC. The mobile station's downlink is muted
to prevent any distracting echo being heard by the mobile station user.
**DTMF message (start_talking):** This signalling indicates the mobile
dispatcher's unmute request to visited MSC. On reception of the DTMF message,
the visited MSC will convert it into DTMF tones and send these DTMF tones
through the network to the anchor MSC.
**Grant Tone:** The Anchor MSC may optionally play an in-band tone to the
dispatcher to indicate that the dispatcher's request is interpreted as a
request to talk and that the downlink of the talking service subscriber will
be unmuted. The attributes of the grant tone (e.g. frequency and duration) are
network operator specific.
**Set Parameter (D-ATT = TRUE):** The Anchor MSC sends this message to the
talker to force his mobile station to unmute its downlink so that the user can
hear what the dispatcher says.
**DTMF message (end_talking):** This signalling indicates the mobile
dispatcher's mute request to the MSC.
**Set Parameter (D-ATT = FALSE):** Once the dispatcher indicates that he has
finished speaking, the Anchor MSC mutes the talker's downlink.

Figure 7: Signalling required to disconnect the group call
**TERMINATION REQUEST:** An authorized mobile station can send a TERMINATION
REQUEST message to clear down the entire voice group call. To do this, the
mobile station must have access to the uplink. The network has to check the
IMSI to verify the calling service subscriber. If the IMSI of the mobile
station which has uplink access is presently not known to the network, the
network shall send an identity request to the mobile station
NOTE 31: Alternatively an authorized dispatcher can terminate the voice group
call in which case a release message is received from the external network.
> NOTE 32: Alternatively an authorized mobile dispatcher can terminate the
> voice group call by using a specific DTMF message sequence. If the mobile
> dispatcher is controlled by the anchor MSC, the specific DTMF message
> sequence is received by the anchor MSC (see figure 7b).
>
> NOTE 33: If the mobile dispatcher is controlled by a relay MSC, the specific
> DTMF message sequence is received by the relay MSC. The relay MSC converts
> the DTMF messages into DTMF tones and sends them towards the anchor MSC (see
> figure 7c).
>
> NOTE 34: Alternatively an authorized fixed line dispatcher can terminate the
> voice group call by using a specific DTMF tone sequence or other applicable
> signalling. In case DTMF is used, the specific DTMF tone sequence is
> received by the anchor MSC (see figure 7d).
NOTE 35: Alternatively an authorized mobile station currently served by a
relay MSC can clear down the entire group call in which case either a Release
(normal call clearing) is received from the relay MSC (for the case when the
calling service subscriber still has the initial dedicated connection to
MSC-A) or a PROCESS_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING message indicating call release is

group call channel or has a dedicated connection to the relay MSC).
**CLEAR CMD:** This message is sent from the MSC to the BSS via each Resource
Controlling SCCP connection to clear radio and terrestrial resources.
**VGCS_TERMIN:** The MSC informs the GCR that the voice group call with the

\- CHANNEL RELEASE messages are sent using UI frames for listeners.
In addition, release messages are sent to all related dispatchers and relay
MSCs. If the group call termination is initiated by an entitled dispatcher,
and there is a dedicated connection for the calling service subscriber between
the anchor MSC and the relay MSC, the anchor MSC shall release this connection
with cause 'normal call clearing'.

Figure 7k: Successful MT short message transfer attempt to a voice group call
1) The SC sends a Message Transfer message to forward a short message to the
SMS-GMSC.
2) The SMS-GMSC sends the MT_ForwardSM_For_VGCS_REQ message to transfer the
received short message to the anchor MSC using the routing information derived
from the group call reference.
3) The anchor MSC sends the GCR_SMS_Interrogation message to the GCR to
retrieve the voice group call attributes for short message transfer.
4) The GCR sends the GCR_SMS_Interrogation_Res message to the anchor MSC
containing the voice group call status and optionally the list of identities
of dispatchers.\ In RANflex configuration with Group Call redundancy message 4
may indicate that the group call is ongoing at another anchor MSC within the
redundancy pool. If so, message 2 is relayed to that anchor MSC (not shown in
figure 7k).
5) The anchor MSC sends the MT_ForwardSM_For_VGCS_RES message to the SMS-GMSC
containing the status of the voice group call and optionally a list of
identities of dispatchers if received from the GCR. Optionally, if the voice
group call is currently ongoing, the SMS-GMSC may initiate point to point
short message transfer attempts to the dispatchers of the voice group call.
6) If the voice group call is established, the anchor MSC sends the
FORWARD_GROUP CALL_SIGNALLING message to deliver the short message to all
related relay MSCs in the voice group call.
7) If the voice group call is established, the anchor MSC sends Message
Transfer message to deliver the short message to the MSs participating in the
voice group call within its MSC area.
8) If the voice group call is established, the relay MSCs sends Message
Transfer message to deliver the short message to the MSs participating in the
voice group call within its MSC area.
#### 11.3.9.2 Point-to-point short message during an ongoing voice group call
In this subclause the term point-to-point short message is used for mobile
terminating short messages destined to a single subscriber and for mobile
originating short messages, regardless whether their final destination is a
single subscriber or a voice group call.
For the transmission and reception of point-to-point short messages via CS
domain during an ongoing voice group call, an MS and a network supporting this
functionality shall apply the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [14] and
3GPP TS 24.011 [15] as follows:
a) When the talking service subscriber is on a dedicated channel, point-to-
point short messages to be sent or received via the CS domain shall be
transmitted on the SACCH of the dedicated channel. If the talking service
subscriber requests to release the uplink while a short message transfer is
ongoing, the MS shall initiate the release of the uplink and abort the
transfer of the short message.
b) When the talking service subscriber is on a voice group call channel, the
MS shall send mobile originating short messages via the CS domain on the SACCH
of the voice group call channel, if at least one of the following conditions
is fulfilled:
\- the short message is destined to the ongoing voice group call of the
talker;
\- the network broadcasts neither an SMS data confidentiality indication nor
an SMS guaranteed privacy indication on the NCH; or
\- the network broadcasts an SMS data confidentiality indication, but no SMS
guaranteed privacy indication on the NCH, and the voice group call channel is
ciphered.
> Otherwise the MS shall leave the voice group call, send the short message as
> specified in 3GPP TS 24.011 [15] and return to the group call in group
> receive mode afterwards, if possible.
>
> If the talking service subscriber requests to release the uplink while a
> short message transfer on the voice group call channel is ongoing, the MS
> shall initiate the release of the uplink and abort the transfer of the short
> message.
c) When the talking service subscriber is on a voice group call channel, the
network may deliver mobile terminating point-to-point short messages via the
CS domain on the SACCH of the voice group call channel, if at least one of the
following conditions is fulfilled:
\- the network does not broadcast an SMS data confidentiality indication on
the NCH; or
\- the network broadcasts an SMS data confidentiality indication on the NCH,
and the voice group call channel is ciphered.
> Otherwise the network shall perform paging into the ongoing voice group call
> as described in subclause 11.3.1.3 c. The paging information on the FACCH of
> the voice group call channel shall indicate explicitly that the paging is
> for a short message. When the paging is received in group transmit mode, the
> reception of the paging shall be indicated to the subscriber. It is then up
> to the subscriber to respond to the paging or not. On request of the
> subscriber to respond to the paging, the MS in group transmit mode shall
> release the uplink, leave the voice group call, receive the short message as
> specified in 3GPP TS 24.011 [15], and return to the group call in group
> receive mode afterwards, if possible.
>
> If the talking service subscriber requests to release the uplink while a
> short message transfer on the voice group call channel is ongoing, the MS
> shall initiate the release of the uplink and abort the transfer of the short
> message.
d) If an MS on a voice group call channel is not the endpoint of the layer 2
link for acknowledged message transfer, it shall ignore point-to-point short
messages received on the SACCH of the voice group call channel.
e) On request of a listening service subscriber to send a point-to-point short
message, the MS in group receive mode shall leave the voice group call, send
the short message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.011 [15], and return to the group
call in group receive mode afterwards, if possible.
> For the delivery of a point-to-point short message to a listening service
> subscriber, the network shall peform paging into ongoing voice group calls
> by means of the notification procedure as described in subclause 11.3.1.3.
> The notification messages on the FACCH of the voice group call channel shall
> indicate explicitly that the paging is for a short message. When the paging
> is received in group receive mode, the reception of the paging shall be
> indicated to the subscriber. It is then up to the subscriber to respond to
> the paging or not. On request of the subscriber to respond to the paging,
> the MS in group receive mode shall leave the voice group call, receive the
> short message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.011 [15], and return to the group
> call in group receive mode afterwards, if possible.
For the transmission and reception of point-to-point short messages via PS
domain during an ongoing voice group call, class A mobile stations supporting
this functionality shall apply the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [14]
and 3GPP TS 24.011 [15].
Editor\'s note: For DTM mobile stations the transmission and reception of
point-to-point short messages via PS domain during an ongoing voice group call
is ffs.
## 11.4 Functional requirement of Anchor MSC
The VGCS handling process in the anchor MSC is shown in figure 8.
**Successful call set-up**
When the VGCS handling process in the anchor MSC receives a VGCS call set-up
request from either a dispatcher or a service subscriber currently located in
the anchor MSC\'s area or a service subscriber currently located in a relay
MSC\'s area, or - in a RANflex configuration or in a RANflex configuration
with group call redundancy - from a service subscriber currently registered in
a VMSC, it interrogates its associated GCR to retrieve the group call
attributes, and waits for a response.
If the GCR returns a positive response containing the group call attributes,
the anchor MSC
> sets up the downlinks to the cells inside the MSC area of the group call
> anchor MSC into which the call is to be sent.; If the \"talker channel
> parameter\" is used, the anchor MSC shall additionally send the parameter to
> the affected BSCs;
>
> sets up the connections to the dispatchers to which a dedicated link is to
> be established;
>
> sets up the connections to the relay MSCs or relay MSC redundancy pools into
> which the call is to be sent;
>
> starts the No Activity Timer;
>
> sends Forward Group Call Signalling messages to all selected relay MSCs if
> the call was not initiated by a dispatcher (however in a non-RANflex
> configuration not to the relay MSC from which the IMSI was received within
> the Send Group Call End Signal message if the call was initiated by a
> service subscriber located in the relay MSC area). The Forward Group Call
> Signalling messages shall contain the IMSI, talker priority and additional
> information of the service subscriber who has initiated the call. In a
> RANflex configuration and in a RANflex configuration with group call
> redundancy, simultaneous group call setup of two service subscribers may
> result in two Send Group Call End Signal messages being received by the
> anchor MSC from two different relay MSCs, with both messages containing an
> IMSI. In this situation the anchor MSC shall discard the IMSI received from
> the relay MSC whose MSC address does not match the generic number with the
> number qualifier indicator set to \"additional calling party number\" from
> the IAM received and accepted from the originating MSC.
NOTE: In a network configuration involving also pre-Rel-7 relay MSCs, the IAM
sent by such a relay MSC as originating MSC will not include a generic number
parameter. If the anchor MSC accepts the IAM from the pre-Rel-7 relay MSC and
receives further IAM(s) including a generic number with number qualifier
indicator set to \"additional calling party number\", the anchor MSC can store
these additional calling party numbers in a list and discard the IMSI received
with a Send Group Call End Signal message from a relay MSC whose MSC address
matches any of the numbers in the list.
> If the network supports talker priorities, the anchor MSC includes the
> talker priority of the service subscriber who has initiated the call in the
> Forward Group Call Signalling messages; and
>
> waits for uplink management messages.
**Procedure Set-up Connections to Relay MSCs and BSCs**
The procedure is shown in figure 9.
The procedure
\- sets up the downlinks to the cells inside the MSC area of the group call
anchor MSC into which the call is to be sent. If the network supports talker
priorities, the anchor MSC additionally sends the talker priority of the
service subscriber who has initiated the call and, if applicable, the
\"emergency mode indication\" with Uplink Seized Command messages\" to the
affected BSCs;
\- sends PREPARE_GROUP_CALL messages to all relay MSCs (in a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy: to all group call relay MSC
redundancy pools) and waits for the responses. If the \"talker channel
parameter\" is used, the anchor MSC shall include this parameter in the
PREPARE_GROUP_CALL messages.
If a positive response containing a Group Call number is received from a relay
MSC, the anchor MSC constructs an IAM using the Group Call number as called
party address, sends it to the relay MSC and waits for the SEND_GROUP
CALL_END_SIGNAL message.
If a SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL message without IMSI is received from a relay
MSC, this indicates to the anchor MSC that at least one downlink to a cell has
been successfully connected in the relay MSC area.
If the call was originated by a service subscriber in a relay MSC area and a
SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL message with the IMSI of the originator is received
from this relay MSC, this indicates to the anchor MSC that the downlink to the
originating cell has been successfully connected. If the negative response on
the PREPARE_GROUP_CALL message is received from originating relay MSC, the
call shall be released.
Relay MSCs (in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: relay MSC
redundancy pools) that do not send positive responses to the
PREPARE_GROUP_CALL message are no longer considered to belong to the list of
relay MSCs (or relay MSC redundancy pools) for this VGCS call.
If, after receipt of a positive response containing a Group Call number from a
relay MSC, the anchor MSC receives an ABORT from the relay MSC, the relay MSC
or relay MSC redundancy pool will no longer be considered to belong to the
list of relay MSCs or relay MSC redundancy pools for this VGCS call.
Optionally in both cases the anchor MSC may retry to establish the connection
to the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool, instead of no longer
considering the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool to belong to the list
of relay MSCs or relay MSC redundancy pools.
If an ABORT message is received from the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy
pool the anchor MSC releases the connection, established with the Group Call
number, to the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool and the relay MSC or
relay MSC redundancy pool is no longer considered to belong to the list of
relay MSCs or relay MSC redundancy pools for this VGCS call.
If a Release message for the connection established with the Group Call number
is received from a relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool, then the anchor MSC
sends an ABORT message to that relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool and the
relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool is no longer considered to belong to
the list of relay MSCs or relay MSC redundancy pools for this VGCS call.
**Unsuccessful call set-up**
If the call set-up is unsuccessful (i.e. conditions for call establishment
have not been met as per subclause 11.3.1.1.2) the anchor MSC sends a
SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL_ACK message or ABORT (depending on the state of the
MAP dialogue) to all relay MSCs, releases the connections to the relay MSCs,
releases all connections to dispatchers, all downlinks to cells inside the
anchor MSC area are released, the GCR is informed that the call is no longer
on-going and the process returns to the idle state.
**Negative response received from the GCR**
If the GCR returns a negative response to the anchor MSC indicating that the
call is already on-going locally i.e. at the associated MSC, the anchor MSC
checks whether the new call was initiated by a dispatcher. If so, the
dispatcher is connected to the on-going call and the process returns to the
idle state. If the new call was initiated by a service subscriber, a Release
message indicating \"user busy\" is returned in order to force the mobile
station of the service subscriber to look for notifications of the respective
group ID on the NCH and join the group call.
If (in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy) the GCR returns a
negative response to the selected anchor MSC indicating that the call is
already on-going at another MSC within the group call anchor MSC redundancy
pool, the selected anchor MSC checks whether the new call was initiated by a
dispatcher or a service subscriber served by another VMSC. If so, the selected
anchor MSC forwards the call setup request to the anchor MSC where the group
call is ongoing (possibly using a special prefix for the called party number).
The selected anchor MSC then acts as a transit node unless it recognizes that
the anchor MSC where the group call is ongoing is out of service. In the
latter case the selected anchor MSC repeats the GCR interrogation including
\"ongoing call override indication\". If the call was initiated by a service
subscriber served by the selected anchor MSC, the selected anchor MSC
interrogates the anchor MSC where the group call is ongoing by means of the
MAP service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO and waits for a response. If the selected
anchor MSC recognizes that the anchor MSC where the group call is ongoing is
out of service or if that anchor MSC responds with a positive
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO response (i.e. the GCRs are out of synch and the group
call at the other anchor MSC is not ongoing), then the selected anchor MSC
repeats the GCR interrogation including \"ongoing call override indication\".
If the anchor MSC where the group call is ongoing responds with a negative
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO response (ongoing call), then the selected anchor MSC
returns a Release message indicating \"user busy\" in order to force the
mobile station of the service subscriber to look for notifications of the
respective group ID on the NCH and join the group call.
If the negative response from the GCR indicates any other reason than \"on-
going call\" the VGCS call set-up request is rejected by sending a release
message back to the initiator and the process returns to the idle state.
**Uplink management**
If an anchor MSC not supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Release
Indication message from a BSC, the anchor MSC marks the uplink as free, sends
Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating \"uplink release
indication\" to all relay MSCs, sends Uplink Release command messages to all
other BSCs, restarts the No Activity Timer and waits for further uplink
management messages.
If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Release
Indication message from a BSC, the anchor MSC compares the talker priority
included in the Uplink Release Indication with the stored talker priority. If
they are equal, the anchor MSC proceeds as specified above for the anchor MSC
not supporting talker priorities; otherwise the anchor MSC discards the Uplink
Release Indication.
If the anchor MSC receives an Uplink Request message without talker priority
or with talker priority \"normal subscriber\" from a BSC, it checks whether
the uplink is marked as free. If so, an Uplink Request Acknowledge message is
returned to the BSC, Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating that
the uplink is no longer free are sent to all relay MSCs, Uplink Seized Command
messages are sent to all other BSCs, the uplink is marked busy and the process
waits for further uplink management messages. If the uplink was not free when
receiving the Uplink Request message, the request is rejected.
If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Request
message with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\" from a BSC,
and the uplink is free or it was seized by the current talker with a lower
talker priority, the anchor MSC checks whether the subscriber has the
subscription for the requested talker priority for this group ID. In a RANflex
configuration (with or without group call redundancy) this check may require
retrieval of information from the visited MSC/VLR by means of the MAP service
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO. If so, the anchor MSC:
\- stores the received data;
\- sends Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating \"uplink seized
command\" with the requested talker priority to the relay MSCs;
\- returns an Uplink Request Acknowledge message with the requested talker
priority to the BSC which has requested the uplink;
\- sends Uplink Seized Command messages with the requested talker priority to
all other BSCs;
\- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if the
talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in the anchor MSC;
\- marks the uplink busy; and
\- waits for further uplink management messages.
Additionally,
\- if the requested talker priority is \"emergency subscriber\", the anchor
MSC sets the emergency mode and includes the \"emergency mode indication\" in
the Uplink Request Acknowledge message and the Uplink Seized Command messages;
furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all active dispatchers with an appropriate
emergency indication (e.g. in-band tone or announcement); furthermore the
anchor MSC alerts all inactive dispatchers by setting up dedicated connections
with an appropriate emergency indication (e.g. special CLI prefix or postfix,
and in-band tone or announcement) and connects the dispatchers to the voice
group call.
\- if the anchor MSC supports the transmission of additional subscriber-
related information, it interrogates the VLR to get the \"additional
information\" assigned to the new talker. In a RANflex configuration (with or
without group call redundancy) this may require retrieval of information from
the visited MSC/VLR by means of the MAP service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO. If
\"additional information\" is available, the anchor MSC includes the
\"additional information\" in the Forward Group Call Signalling messages
indicating \"uplink seized command\" to all relay MSCs and sends VGCS
Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in the call and connected to the
anchor MSC. Furthermore, the anchor MSC sends a VGCS Additional Info message
on the dedicated connection to the BSC serving the current talker, before it
releases the current talker.
If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Request
message with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\" from a BSC,
and the uplink was seized by the current talker with the same or a higher
talker priority, then the anchor MSC sends an Uplink Reject Command message
with the current talker priority to the BSC.
If the anchor MSC receives an Uplink Request Confirm message from a BSC, it
stores the received data and waits for further uplink management messages.
Additionally, if the anchor MSC supports the transmission of additional
subscriber-related information, it interrogates the VLR to get the
\"additional information\" assigned to the subscriber. In a RANflex
configuration (with or without group call redundancy) this interrogation may
require retrieval of information from the visited MSC/VLR by means of the MAP
service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO. If \"additional information\" is available, the
relay MSC sends VGCS Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in the call
and connected to this relay MSC, and Forward Group Call Signalling messages
with the additional info to all relay MSCs.
If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Emergency Reset
Indication from a BSC and the subscription check is successful, the anchor MSC
resets the emergency mode, sends Emergency Reset Command messages to all BSCs
involved in the call and connected to the anchor MSC, and Forward Group Call
Signalling messages indicating \"emergency reset command\" to all relay MSCs.
If the talker priority at receipt of the Emergency Reset Indication is
\"emergency subscriber\", then it is changed in the anchor MSC to \"normal
subscriber\"; furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all active dispatchers with an
appropriate emergency indication (e.g. in-band tone or announcement);
furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all inactive dispatchers by setting up
dedicated connections with an appropriate emergency indication (e.g. special
CLI prefix or postfix, and in-band tone or announcement) and connects the
dispatchers to the voice group call.
If an anchor MSC not supporting talker priorities receives a Process Group
Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink release indication\" from a relay
MSC , the anchor MSC marks the uplink as free, sends Forward Group Call
Signalling messages indicating \"uplink release indication\" to all other
relay MSCs, sends Uplink Release command messages to all BSCs, restarts the No
Activity Timer and waits for further uplink management messages. If there is a
dedicated connection for the talking service subscriber between the relay MSC
and the anchor MSC, the anchor MSC shall release this connection with cause
'normal, unspecified'.
If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Process Group Call
Signalling message indicating \"uplink release indication\" from a relay MSC,
the anchor MSC compares the talker priority included in the Process Group Call
Signalling message with the stored talker priority. If they are equal, the
anchor MSC proceeds as specified above for the anchor MSC not supporting
talker priorities; otherwise the anchor MSC discards the Process Group Call
Signalling message.
If the anchor MSC receives a Process Group Call Signalling message from a
relay MSC indicating \"uplink request\" without talker priority or with talker
priority \"normal subscriber\", it checks whether the uplink is marked as
free. If so, a Forward Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink
request acknowledgement\" is returned to the relay MSC, Forward Group Call
Signalling messages indicating that the uplink is no longer free are sent to
all other relay MSCs, Uplink Seized Command messages are sent to all BSCs, the
uplink is marked busy and the process waits for further uplink management
messages. If the uplink was not free when receiving the Process Group Call
Signalling message (Uplink Request), the request is rejected.
If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Process Group Call
Signalling message from a relay MSC indicating \"uplink request\" with a
talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\", and the uplink is free or
it was seized by the current talker with a lower talker priority, then the
anchor MSC:
\- returns a Forward Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink request
acknowledgement\" with the requested talker priority to the relay MSC;
\- sends Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating \"uplink seized
command\" and the requested talker priority to all other relay MSCs;
\- sends Uplink Seized Command messages with the requested talker priority to
all BSSs involved in the call;
\- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if the
talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in the anchor MSC;
\- marks the uplink as busy; and
\- waits for further uplink management messages.
Additionally,
\- if the requested talker priority in the Process Group Call Signalling
message from the relay MSC is \"emergency subscriber\", the anchor MSC sets
the emergency mode and includes the \"emergency mode indication\" in the
Uplink Seized Command messages; furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all active
dispatchers with an appropriate emergency indication (e.g. in-band tone or
announcement); furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all inactive dispatchers by
setting up dedicated connections with an appropriate emergency indication
(e.g. special CLI prefix or postfix, and in-band tone or announcement) and
connects the dispatchers to the voice group call.
\- if \"additional information\" about the new talker was included in the
Process Group Call Signalling message from the relay MSC, the anchor MSC
includes the \"additional information\" in the Forward Group Call Signalling
messages indicating \"uplink seized command\" to all other relay MSCs and
sends VGCS Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in the call and
connected to the anchor MSC. Furthermore, the anchor MSC sends a VGCS
Additional Info message on the dedicated connection to the BSC serving the
current talker, before it releases the current talker.
If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Process Group Call
Signalling message from a relay MSC indicating \"uplink request\" with a
talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\", and the uplink was seized
by the current talker with the same or a higher talker priority, then the
anchor MSC returns a Forward Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink
reject command\" with the current talker priority to the relay MSC.
If the anchor MSC receives a Process Group Call Signalling message with
\"additional info\" from a relay MSC, the anchor MSC sends VGCS Additional
Info messages to all BSCs involved in the group call and connected to the
anchor MSC, and Forward Group Call Signalling messages with \"additional
info\" to all other relay MSCs.
If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Process Group Call
Signalling message with \"emergency mode reset command\" from a relay MSC, the
anchor MSC resets the emergency mode, sends Forward Group Call Signalling
messages with \"emergency mode reset command\" to all other relay MSCs, and
sends Emergency Reset Command messages to all BSCs involved in the call and
connected to the anchor MSC. If the talker priority at receipt of the
\"emergency mode reset command\" is \"emergency subscriber\", then it is
changed in the anchor MSC to \"normal subscriber\"; furthermore the anchor MSC
alerts all active dispatchers with an appropriate emergency indication (e.g.
in-band tone or announcement); furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all inactive
dispatchers by setting up dedicated connections with an appropriate emergency
indication (e.g. special CLI prefix or postfix, and in-band tone or
announcement) and connects the dispatchers to the voice group call.
If the anchor MSC receives an ABORT message from a relay MSC, the connection
to the relay MSC is released and the relay MSC is no longer considered to be
part of the call.
**Call release**
If the anchor MSC receives a termination request from an entitled dispatcher
(see figures 7b to 7d) or a Termination Request message from the initiating
service subscriber who currently has access to the uplink, it sends Send Group
Call End Signal ACK messages to all relay MSCs, sends Release messages to all
relay MSCs, sends Release messages to all dispatchers and BSCs, informs the
GCR that the call is no longer on-going and the process returns to the idle
state. If the group call termination is initiated by an entitled dispatcher,
and there is a dedicated connection for the talking service subscriber between
the anchor MSC and the relay MSC, the anchor MSC shall release this connection
with cause 'normal call clearing'.
If the anchor MSC receives a Process Group Call Signalling message from a
relay MSC indicating \"release group call\" or an ISUP Release message from a
relay MSC indicating \"Normal call clearing\" for the calling service
subscriber's dedicated connection to the anchor MSC, then the anchor MSC sends
Send Group Call End Signal ACK messages to all relay MSCs, sends Release
messages to all relay MSCs, sends Release messages to all dispatchers and
BSCs, informs the GCR that the call is no longer on-going and the process
returns to the idle state.
If the anchor MSC receives an ISUP Release message from a relay MSC with cause
value other than \"Normal call clearing\" for the calling service subscribers
dedicated connection to the anchor MSC, then the anchor MSC shall send Uplink
Release Command messages to all BSCs and Forward Group Call Signalling
messages with Uplink Release Indication parameter to all relay MSCs.
If the no activity time in the anchor MSC expires, i.e. \"no activity\" (as
specified in subclause 8.1.2.3) has been detected for the time specified in
the GCR, the anchor MSC sends Send Group Call End Signal ACK messages to all
relay MSCs, sends Release messages to all relay MSCs, sends Release messages
to all dispatchers and BSCs, informs the GCR that the call is no longer on-
going and the process returns to the idle state.
**SM MT delivery**
When the VGCS handling process in the anchor MSC receives an
MT_ForwardSM_for_VGCS_REQ message from a SMS-GMSC, the anchor MSC shall
interrogate the GCR to retrieve the group call attributes for short message
transfer. The anchor MSC shall deliver to the SMS-GMSC the status of the voice
group call and optionally a list of identities of dispatchers within the
MT_ForwardSM_for_VGCS_RES message.
If the voice group call is established, the anchor MSC shall distribute the
short message TPDU to all connected relay MSCs using the FORWARD_GROUP
CALL_SIGNALLING message and shall deliver the short message to the relevant
cells using the already established downlink channel for the voice group call.
If the voice group call is not established, the anchor MSC shall discard the
short message TPDU.

Figure 9: Procedure Set-up Connections to Relay MSCs and BSCs (sheet 1 of 1)
## 11.5 Functional requirement of Relay MSC
The VGCS handling process in the relay MSC is shown in figure 10.
**Successful call set-up initiated by a service subscriber**
When the VGCS handling process in the relay MSC receives a VGCS call set-up
request from a service subscriber currently located in a relay MSC\'s area, it
interrogates its associated GCR to retrieve the anchor MSC address and waits
for a response.
If the GCR returns a positive response containing the anchor MSC address, the
relay MSC sets up a dedicated connection for the initiating service subscriber
to the anchor MSC by constructing an IAM with calling party number set to VGCS
prefix plus group call reference, and with a generic number parameter with the
number qualifier indicator set to \"additional calling party number\" and
address signal set to the address of this relay MSC, sending it to the anchor
MSC, and waits for call release.
**Negative response received from the GCR**
If the GCR returns a negative response to the relay MSC indicating that the
call is already on-going locally, i.e. at the associated MSC, the relay MSC
sends a Release message indicating \"user busy\" to the service subscriber in
order to force the mobile station of the service subscriber to look for
notifications of the respective group ID on the NCH and join the group call.
If (in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy) the GCR returns a
negative response to the relay MSC indicating that the call is already on-
going at another MSC within the group call relay MSC redundancy pool, the
selected relay MSC interrogates the relay MSC where the group call is ongoing
by means of the MAP service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO and waits for a response. If
the selected relay MSC recognizes that the relay MSC where the group call is
ongoing is out of service or if that relay MSC responds with a positive
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO response (i.e. the GCRs are out of synch and the group
call at the other relay MSC is not ongoing), then the selected relay MSC
repeats the GCR interrogation including \"ongoing call override indication\".
If the relay MSC where the group call is ongoing responds with a negative
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO response (ongoing call), then the selected relay MSC
returns a Release message indicating \"user busy\" in order to force the
mobile station of the service subscriber to look for notifications of the
respective group ID on the NCH and join the group call.
If the negative response from the GCR indicates any other reason than \"on-
going call\" the VGCS call set-up request is rejected by sending a release
message back to the initiator and the process returns to the idle state.
**Successful call set-up initiated by the anchor MSC**
When the VGCS handling process in the relay MSC receives a PREPARE_GROUP_CALL
message from the anchor MSC, it interrogates its associated GCR to retrieve
the list of cells inside the relay MSC area into which the call is to be sent.
If the GCR returns a positive response, the relay MSC requests a Group Call
number from its VLR.
If the VLR returns a Group Call number, a PREPARE_GROUP CALL acknowledgement
containing the Group Call number is returned to the anchor MSC and the relay
MSC waits for the incoming call.
If the incoming call identified by the Group Call number is received, the
relay MSC releases the Group Call number and sets up the downlinks to the
cells inside the relay MSC area into which the call is to be sent.
If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used, the relay MSC shall additionally
send the parameter to the affected BSCs
If the network supports talker priorities and the group call was initiated by
a service subscriber currently located in the relay MSC\'s area, then the
relay MSC additionally sends the talker priority of the service subscriber who
has initiated the call and, if applicable, the \"emergency mode indication\"
with Uplink Seized Command messages to the affected BSCs.
If the group call was initiated by a service subscriber currently located in
the relay MSC\'s area, then the relay MSC shall send a
SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL message, including the IMSI and additional
information of the service subscriber, to the anchor MSC when the downlink has
been set up successfully to the originating cell. Additionally, if the network
supports talker priorities, the relay MSC includes the talker priority of the
service subscriber in the SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL message.
In a RANflex configuration, the IMSI, talker priority and additional
information (initial talker information) shall be deleted by the relay MSC
after sending SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL. If initial talker information is
received in a subsequent FORWARD_GROUP_CALL_SIGNALLING message, the relay MSC
shall use this information for the voice group call.
NOTE: The initial talker information sent within SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL
can be invalid, e.g. due to a race condition, if the voice group call is
simulateously set up by a dispatcher or another service subscriber.
If the call was not originated by a service subscriber from the relay MSC
area, the relay MSC shall send a SEND_GROUP_CALL_END_SIGNAL message without
IMSI information element to the anchor MSC as soon as a downlink has been set
up successfully to any cell.
Then the relay MSC waits for uplink management messages.
**Negative response received from the GCR II**
If the GCR returns a negative response to the relay MSC, the relay MSC returns
a PREPARE_GROUP_CALL negative response to the anchor MSC and returns to the
idle state.
**No Group Call number received from VLR**
If the VLR could not allocate a Group Call number, the relay MSC returns a
PREPARE_GROUP CALL_CALL negative response to the anchor MSC, informs the GCR
that the call is no longer on-going and returns to the idle state.
**Abort received from VLR**
If the VLR indicates that the Group Call number supervision timer has expired,
the relay MSC sends an ABORT message to the anchor MSC, informs the GCR that
the call is no longer on-going and returns to the idle state.
**Abort received from Anchor MSC**
If, after returning a PREPARE_GROUP_CALL acknowledgement containing the Group
Call number, an ABORT is received from the anchor MSC the relay MSC releases
the Group Call number, informs the GCR that the call is no longer on-going and
returns to the idle state.
Abort initiated by Relay MSC
The relay MSC may Abort the dialogue by sending an ABORT message to the anchor
MSC(e.g. if the relay MSC fails to establish any downlinks in its area). The
relay MSC also releases any resources, informs the GCR that the call is no
longer on-going and returns to the idle state.
**Unsuccessful call set-up**
Unsuccessful call set-up is determined in the anchor MSC (as per subclause
11.3.1.1.2). The relay MSC follows the procedures specified for **\"** Abort
received from Anchor MSC**\"** and **\"** Call release**\"**.
**Uplink management**
If a relay MSC not supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Release
Indication message from a BSC, the relay MSC marks the uplink as free, sends a
Process Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink release indication\"
to the anchor MSC, sends Uplink Release Command messages to all other BSCs,
and waits for further uplink management messages.
NOTE: If there is a dedicated connection for the talking service subscriber
between the relay MSC and the anchor MSC, the anchor MSC will release this
connection with cause 'normal, unspecified'.
If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Release
Indication message from a BSC, the relay MSC compares the talker priority
included in the Uplink Release Indication with the stored talker priority. If
they are equal, the relay MSC proceeds as specified above for the relay MSC
not supporting talker priorities, except that it includes the talker priority
in the Process Group Call Signalling message to the anchor MSC; otherwise the
relay MSC discards the Uplink Release Indication.
If the relay MSC receives an Uplink Request message without talker priority or
with talker priority \"normal subscriber\" from a BSC, the relay MSC checks
whether the uplink is marked as free. If so, a Process Group Call Signalling
message indicating \"uplink request\" is sent to the anchor MSC, Uplink Seized
Command messages are sent to all other BSCs, the uplink is marked busy and the
process waits for further uplink management messages. If the uplink was not
free when receiving the Uplink Request, the request is rejected.
If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Request message
with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\" from a BSC and the
uplink is free or it was seized by the current talker with a lower talker
priority, the relay MSC checks whether the subscriber has the subscription for
the requested talker priority for that group ID. In a RANflex configuration
and in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy this check may
require retrieval of information from the visited MSC/VLR by means of the MAP
service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO. If so, the relay MSC:
\- stores the received data;
\- sends a Process Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink request\"
and the requested talker priority to the anchor MSC;
\- sends Uplink Seized Command messages with the requested talker priority to
all other BSCs involved in the call and connected to this relay MSC;
\- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if the
talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in this relay MSC;
\- marks the uplink as busy; and
\- waits for further uplink management messages.
Additionally,
\- if the requested talker priority is \"emergency subscriber\", the relay MSC
sets the emergency mode and includes the \"emergency mode indication\" in the
Uplink Seized Command messages;
\- if the relay MSC supports the transmission of additional subscriber-related
information, it interrogates the VLR to get the \"additional information\"
assigned to the new talker. In a RANflex configuration and in a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy this may require retrieval of
information from the visited MSC/VLR by means of the MAP service
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO. If \"additional information\" is available, the relay
MSC includes the \"additional information\" in the Process Group Call
Signalling message indicating \"uplink request\" to the anchor MSC.
If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Request message
with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\" from a BSC, and the
uplink was seized by the current talker with the same or a higher talker
priority, then the relay MSC sends an Uplink Reject Command message with the
current talker priority to the BSC.
If the relay MSC receives an Uplink Request Confirm message from a BSC, it
stores the data and waits for further uplink management messages.
Additionally, if the relay MSC supports the transmission of additional
subscriber-related information, it interrogates the VLR to get the
\"additional information\" assigned to the subscriber. In a RANflex
configuration and in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy this
interrogation may require retrieval of information from the visited MSC/VLR by
means of the MAP service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO. If \"additional information\"
is available, the relay MSC sends VGCS Additional Info messages to all BSCs
involved in the call and connected to this relay MSC, and a Forward Group Call
Signalling message with the additional info to the anchor MSC.
If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Emergency Reset
Indication from a BSC and the subscription check is successful, the relay MSC
sends a Progress Group Call Signalling message with \"emergency mode reset
command\" to the anchor MSC and Emergency Reset Command messages to all BSCs
involved in the call and connected to this relay MSC, and waits for further
uplink management messages. If the talker priority at receipt of the Emergency
Reset Indication is \"emergency subscriber\", then it is changed in the relay
MSC to \"normal subscriber\".
If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from a
anchor MSC indicating \"uplink release indication\", it marks the uplink as
free, sends Uplink Release command messages to all BSCs and waits for further
uplink management messages.
If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from a
anchor MSC indicating \"uplink seized command\" with or without talker
priority, then the relay MSC
marks the uplink as busy,
sends Uplink Seized Command messages with the requested talker priority to all
BSCs involved in the call and connected to this relay MSC;
\- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if the
talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in this relay MSC; and
\- waits for further uplink management messages.
Additionally,
\- if the Forward Group Call Signalling message from the anchor MSC contained
the talker priority \"emergency subscriber\", the relay MSC sets the emergency
mode and includes the \"emergency mode indication\" in the Uplink Seized
Command messages;
\- if \"additional information\" about the new talker was included in the
Forward Group Call Signalling message from the anchor MSC, the relay MSC sends
VGCS Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in the call and connected
to the relay MSC. Furthermore, the relay MSC sends a VGCS Additional Info
message on the dedicated connection to the BSC serving the current talker,
before it releases the current talker.
If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message with the
\"additional info\", the relay MSC sends VGCS Additional Info message to all
BSCs involved in the group call and connected to this relay MSC, and waits for
further uplink management messages.
If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from an
anchor MSC indicating \"uplink reject command\" with or without talker
priority, it returns an Uplink Reject message to the BSC which has requested
the uplink and waits for further uplink management messages. If the \"uplink
reject command\" included a talker priority, the relay MSC includes the talker
priority in the Uplink Reject Command message
If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from an
anchor MSC indicating \"uplink request acknowledgement\" with or without
talker priority, then the relay MSC
> \- returns an Uplink Request Acknowledge message with the requested talker
> priority to the BSC which has requested the uplink;
>
> \- sets up a dedicated connection for the new talker to the anchor MSC
> (implementation option);
>
> \- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if the
> talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in this relay MSC; and
>
> \- waits for further uplink management messages.
Additionally,
\- if the requested talker priority is \"emergency subscriber\", the relay MSC
includes the \"emergency mode indication\" in the Uplink Request Acknowledge
messages;
\- if \"additional information\" about the new talker is available, the relay
MSC sends VGCS Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in the call and
connected to the relay MSC. Furthermore, the relay MSC sends a VGCS Additional
Info message on the dedicated connection to the BSC serving the current
talker, before it releases the current talker.
If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Forward Group Call
Signalling message with \"emergency mode reset command\" from the anchor MSC,
the relay MSC resets the emergency mode, sends Emergency Reset Command
messages to all BSCs involved in the call and connected to this relay MSC, and
waits for further uplink management messages. If the talker priority at
receipt of the \"emergency mode reset command\" is \"emergency subscriber\",
then it is changed in the relay MSC to \"normal subscriber\".
If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from an
anchor MSC indicating \"uplink release command\", it sends an Uplink Release
Command message to the BSC which currently has access to the uplink and waits
for further uplink management messages.
If the relay MSC receives an ABORT message from a anchor MSC, it sends release
messages to all BSCs, informs the GCR that the call is no longer on-going and
the process returns to the idle state.
**Call release**
When receiving a release message, with cause 'normal call clearing' from the
anchor MSC for the dedicated connection which was set-up for the initiating
service subscriber located in the relay MSC area, the relay MSC releases the
connection to the service subscriber and the process returns to the idle
state.
When the initiating service subscriber releases the call while a dedicated
connection to the anchor MSC is established, the relay MSC sends a release
message with cause 'normal call clearing' for the dedicated connection to the
anchor MSC and the process returns to the idle state.
When the initiating service subscriber releases the call, while on a group
call channel or a dedicated connection to the relay MSC, the relay MSC sends a
Process Group Call Signalling message to the anchor MSC indicating \"release
group call\" and waits for the Release message and the Send Group Call End
Signal Acknowledgement from the anchor MSC.
When receiving a Send Group Call End Signal Acknowledgement or ABORT from the
anchor MSC, or a release message for the connection that was set up using the
Group Call number, the relay MSC releases all downlinks to cells inside the
relay MSC area, informs the GCR that the call is no longer on-going and the
process returns to the idle state.
**SM MT delivery**
When the VGCS handling process in the relay MSC receives a FORWARD_GROUP
CALL_SIGNALLING message containing a short message TPDU from the anchor MSC,
the R-MSC shall deliver the short message to the relevant cells using the
already established downlink channel for the voice group call.

## 11.5A Functional requirement of group call serving MSC (within a RANflex
pool)
The process in the group call serving MSC is shown in figure 10A1.
The group call serving MSC is either the anchor MSC or a relay MSC.
**Successful call set-up initiated by a service subscriber**
When receiving a SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO interrogation request from a VMSC, the
group call serving MSC (in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy:
the selected group call serving MSC) interrogates its associated GCR to
retrieve the Group Call Reference and the Anchor MSC address from the given
cell Id / Group Id pair and return this information to the VMSC. The group
call serving MSC shall temporarily store in its associated GCR the initiating
subscriber\'s talker priority, his subscribed additional information, his IMSI
as received in the interrogation request from the VMSC and the originating
cell id. The group call serving MSC shall then wait for the group call being
set up:\ If the group call serving MSC is the anchor MSC, it waits for an IAM
from the VMSC; if the group call serving MSC is a relay MSC, it waits for a
PREPARE_GROUP_CALL from the anchor MSC.\ Waiting for the group call being set
up shall be supervised by a timer T3.\ When receiving IAM from the visited
MSC, timer T3 is stopped and processing continues in the process
VGCS_Handling_Anchor_MSC after reception of the VGCS call setup request in
Idle state.\ When receiving PREPARE_GROUP_CALL from the anchor MSC, timer T3
is stopped and processing continues in the process VGCS_Handling_Relay_MSC
after reception of PREPARE GROUP CALL in Idle state.
**Unsuccessful call set-up**
In a RANflex configuration: If the group call reference could not be retrieved
or the GCR returns a negative response indicating \"on-going call\" to the
group call serving MSC, an error indication is returned to the VMSC and the
process returns to the idle state.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: If the GCR returns a
negative response indicating \"on-going call\" to the group call serving MSC,
the group call serving MSC forwards the SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO message within
the same redundancy pool to the group call serving MSC where the group call is
ongoing.
If the selected group call serving MSC recognizes that the group call serving
MSC where the group call is ongoing is out of service or if that group call
serving MSC responds with a positive SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO response (i.e. the
GCRs are out of synch and the group call at the other group call serving MSC
is not ongoing), then the selected group call serving MSC repeats the GCR
interrogation including \"ongoing call override indication\". If the group
call serving MSC where the group call is ongoing responds with a negative
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO response (ongoing call), then the selected group call
serving MSC returns a negative SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO response indicating
\"ongoingGroupCall\" to the VMSC in order to force the mobile station of the
service subscriber to look for notifications of the respective group ID on the
NCH and join the group call.
At timeout of timer T3 the temporarily stored initiating subscriber\'s talker
priority, his subscribed additional information and his IMSI shall be deleted
from the GCR.
Figure 10A1: The VGCS handling process in the group call serving MSC (sheet 1
of 2)
Figure 10A1: The VGCS handling process in the group call serving MSC (sheet 2
of 2)
**Retrieval of VGCS subscription data**
The procedure in the group call serving MSC to retrieve subscription
information from the VMSC is shown in figure 10A2.
In a RANflex configuration with or without group call redundancy, if the group
call serving MSC receives an uplink request or a request to transmit
application-specific data, it determines from the NRI in the requesting
subscriber\'s TMSI whether it is the requesting subscriber\'s VMSC.
If it is not, then the group call serving MSC retrieves the IMSI and
information about subscribed talker priorities from the VLR of the VMSC by
means of the MAP service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO.
\- If a response is received from the VMSC, the procedure ends.
As an implementation option the group call serving MSC may initiate a MAP
Update_Location_Area procedure towards its VLR in order to retrieve the
subscriber data from the HLR. During this procedure the VLR allocates a new
TMSI including an NRI referring to the group call serving MSC.
As an alternative implementation option the group call serving MSC may store
the TMSI temporarily together with the IMSI and the other information received
from the VLR of the VMSC and use these data for subscription checks during
subsequent talker requests. Use of the temporary subscriber data may be
limited e.g. to an implementation dependent time or for an implementation
dependent number of subsequent talker requests. The group call serving MSC
shall delete the temporary subscriber data when the group call is released.
\- If no response is received or if the VMSC is out of service, the group call
serving MSC should initiate a MAP Update_Location_Area procedure towards its
VLR. During this procedure the MSC requests the MS to provide its IMSI and the
VLR allocates a new TMSI including an NRI referring to the group call serving
MSC. The group call serving MSC checks whether the MS has the necessary
subscription for the requested action when the Update_Location_Area procedure
is completed.
NOTE: As an operator option, for this case of a network internal failure, the
group call serving MSC can skip the MAP Update_Location_Area procedure and
perform the subscription check using a backup subscription profile.
As an operator option, the group call serving MSC may proceed with the
handling of the request received from the MS, assuming that the MS has the
necessary subscription, and perform the Update_Location_Area procedure in
parallel. If the result of the subscription check after completion of the
Update_Location_Area procedure is negative and the MS still has the uplink
seized, the group call serving MSC shall initiate an uplink release procedure.
**Implicit location update procedure**
The procedure for the implict location update in the group call serving MSC is
shown in figure 10A3.
Sheet 1: The procedures Check_IMEI_MSC, Obtain_IMEI_MSC, Obtain_IMSI_MSC and
Authenticate_MSC are specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 [18].

## 11.5B Functional requirement of VMSC (within a RANflex pool)
The process in the visited MSC is shown in figure 10B.
**Successful call set-up initiated by a service subscriber**
When the VGCS handling process in the originating MSC receives a VGCS call
set-up request from a service subscriber, the VMSC derives the address of the
group call serving MSC or group call serving MSC redundancy pool from the
requesting subscriber\'s current LAC. If the VMSC is the group call serving
MSC or belongs to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool of the requesting
subscriber\'s current LAC, processing continues in the process
VGCS_Handling_Anchor_MSC or VGCS_Handling_Relay_MSC after reception of the
VGCS call setup request in Idle state. Otherwise, the visited MSC interrogates
the group call serving MSC by means of the MAP service SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO to
retrieve the anchor MSC address and Group Call Reference and waits for a
response.
If the group call serving MSC returns a positive response containing the
address of the anchor MSC or anchor MSC redundancy pool and the address is
different from the visited MSC\'s address, the originating MSC sets up a
dedicated connection for the initiating service subscriber to the anchor MSC
by constructing an IAM with calling party number set to VGCS prefix plus group
call reference, and with a generic number parameter with the number qualifier
indicator set to \"additional calling party number\" and address signal set to
the address of the group call serving MSC (in a RANflex configuration with
group call redundancy this shall be the same address as used to route the
SEND_GROUP_CALL_INFO message , i.e. identifying the redundancy pool), sending
it to the anchor MSC, and waits for call release. If the VMSC is the anchor
MSC or belongs to the anchor MSC redundancy pool, processing continues in the
process VGCS_Handling_Anchor_MSC after reception of the VGCS call setup
request in Idle state.
**Negative response received from the group call serving** **MSC**
If the group call serving MSC returns a negative response to the originating
MSC indicating that the call is already on-going, the originating MSC sends a
Release message indicating \"user busy\" to the service subscriber in order to
force the mobile station of the service subscriber to look for notifications
of the respective group ID on the NCH and join the group call.
If the negative response from the group call serving MSC indicates any other
reason than \"on-going call\" the VGCS call set-up request is rejected by
sending a release message back to the initiator and the process returns to the
idle state.

## 11.6 Functional requirement of GCR
The process in the GCR for RANflex and without RANflex configurations is shown
in figure 11.
The process in the GCR for RANflex configuration with group call redundancy is
shown in figure 11A. Figure 11A does not show details on GCR restoration (see
subclause 5.3.3).
**Service subscriber initiated call**
If the GCR receives an interrogation request for a call initiated by a service
subscriber who is located in the MSC area of the associated MSC, the GCR
calculates the group call reference from the Group ID and the originating cell
ID.
If the group call reference was successfully calculated, the GCR checks
whether a VGCS call with that group call reference is already on-going.
If the call is not marked as on-going, the GCR checks whether an anchor MSC
address is stored in its group call reference record. If this is the case and
initial talker information is not yet stored, a positive response including
the anchor MSC address is returned to the MSC, the initial talker information
(IMSI, talker priority, originating cell id and additional info) of the
initiating service subscriber is stored in the GCR and the process returns to
the idle state. If anchor MSC address and initial talker information are
stored (this is the case where the associated MSC is relay MSC, and timer T3
is running, i.e. group call setup is in progress but the call is not yet fully
established), a negative response indicating \"on-going call\" is returned to
the MSC and the process returns to the idle state. If no anchor MSC address is
stored (i.e. the associated MSC is anchor MSC with respect to this group call
reference) the GCR marks its group call reference record with \"on-going
call\" and returns a positive response including the group call attributes to
the MSC and the process returns to the idle state.
If the group call reference could not be successfully calculated from the
Group ID and the originating cell ID, the GCR returns a negative response
indicating \"failure\" to the MSC and the process returns to the idle state.
If the call was marked as on-going, the GCR returns a negative response
indicating \"on-going call\" to the MSC and the process returns to the idle
state.
**IAM initiated call**
If the GCR receives an interrogation request for a call initiated by a
dispatcher or by a service subscriber who is not located in the MSC area of
the associated MSC, the GCR checks the calling party number of the initiator
against the list of identities of dispatchers which are allowed to initiate
the voice group call and against the VGCS prefix plus group call reference in
order to determine whether the initiator is allowed to set-up the call. If the
check is successful the GCR checks whether a VGCS call with the same group
call reference is already on-going.
If the call is not marked as on-going, the GCR marks its group call reference
record with \"on-going call\" and returns a positive response including the
group call attributes to the MSC and the process returns to the idle state. In
addition the GCR shall delete stored initial talker information (if any).
If the calling party number check was not successful, the GCR returns a
negative response indicating \"failure\" to the MSC and the process returns to
the idle state.
If the call was marked as on-going, the GCR returns a negative response
indicating \"on-going call\" to the MSC and the process returns to the idle
state.
**Anchor MSC triggered call**
If the GCR (associated to a relay MSC) receives an interrogation request for a
call triggered by the anchor MSC, the GCR returns a positive response to the
MSC including:\ \- the list of cells inside the MSC area of the requesting MSC
in which the call is to be sent\ \- the stored initial talker information (if
any)\ and\ \- marks its group call reference with \"on-going call\",\ -deletes
the stored initial talker information (if any)\ and the process returns to the
idle state.
**VMSC triggered call (in a RANflex configuration)**
If the GCR (associated to a group call serving MSC) receives an interrogation
request for a call triggered by the VMSC, the GCR
\- calculates the group call reference from the Group ID and the originating
cell ID.
If for the calculated group call reference the record is marked with \"on-
going call\" or initial talker information is already stored, a negative
response indicating \"on-going call\" is returned to the GCSMSC and the
process returns to the idle state. Otherwise the GCR
\- stores the initial talker information (IMSI, talker priority, originating
cell id and additional information received with the request); and
\- returns a positive response including group call reference and , if the
group call serving MSC is a relay MSC, the anchor MSC address.
**Call release**
If the GCR receives a call released indication from the MSC, the \"on-going
call\" indicator in the group call reference record is reset, the initial
talker information is deleted (if any) and the process returns to the idle
state.
**SM MT delivery**
When receiving an interrogation request from the anchorMSC, the GCR shall
check if the voice group call is established or not and shall send a response
containing the voice group call attributes for short message transfer to the
anchor MSC.

## 11.7 Functional requirement of VLR
The Group Call number allocation process in the VLR is shown in figure 12.
**Successful procedure**
When receiving a request from the relay MSC to allocate a Group Call number,
the VLR checks if a Group Call number is available. If so it selects a Group
Call number, marks the number as allocated, returns a positive response
including the Group Call number to the MSC, starts a supervision timer and
waits for removal of the Group Call number. If the VLR receives a request to
release the Group Call number, the VLR marks the Group Call number as free and
the process returns to the idle state.
**No Group Call number available**
If no Group Call number is available, the VLR returns a negative response
indicating \"no Group Call number available\" to the MSC and the process
returns to the idle state.
**Supervision timer expires**
If the supervision timer expires, the VLR indicates to the relay MSC that the
dialogue has to be aborted.

11.8 Functional requirement of SMS Gateway MSC
**SM MT delivery**
When receiving a short message TPDU from the SC, the SMS‑GMSC shall inspect
the parameters and identify the group call reference.
NOTE: The SMS‑GMSC may be identical to the MSC.
If the parameters are incorrect then the SMS-GMSC shall return the appropriate
error information to the SC in a failure report (see clauses 9 and 10 of 3GPP
TS23.040 [14]).
If no errors are found within the parameters the SMS-GMSC shall send the
MT_ForwardSM_For_VGCS_REQ message to transfer the received short message to
the anchor MSC or anchor MSC redundancy pool using the routing information
derived from the group call reference.
If the SMS-GMSC receives the MT_ForwardSM_For_VGCS_RES message indicating the
voice group call is established and including a list of identities of
dispatchers, it may optionally initiate point-to-point short message transfer
attempts to the dispatchers who are connected to the voice group call.
If the SMS-GMSC receives the MT_ForwardSM_For_VGCS_RES message indicating the
voice group call is not established, it shall either
i) discard the short message and return the appropriate error information to
the SC, or
ii) initiate point to point short message transfer attempts to the members of
the group.
NOTE: How the routing information of the voice group call subscribers for the
point to point SMS transfer can be derived from the group call reference is
out of scope of this specification and implementation dependent. This can be
achieved e.g. by an internal or external database.

# 13 List of system parameters
## 13.1 Timers
### 13.1.1 Txx
This is a supervision timer on the anchor MSC for the setup of the voice group
call. It is started on receipt of a SETUP message from the calling subscriber
when the calling subscriber is in the anchor MSC area and on receipt of an
ISUP IAM from the relay MSC when the calling subscriber is in the relay MSC
area. Refer to subclause 11.3.1.1.2 for procedures on expiry.
The value of timer Txx is operator specific.
### 13.1.2 T1
In a network supporting talker priorities or uplink access option (i) as
defined in subclause 7.2, the uplink busy message on the FACCH of the voice
group call channel downlink is repeated by the BSS every T1 seconds (see
subclause 11.3.7.1).
The value of timer T1 is operator specific. Its default value is 5 seconds.
### 13.1.3 T2
In a network supporting the transmission of additional subscriber-related
information, the additional info message on the SACCH of the voice group call
channel downlink is repeated by the BSS every T2 seconds, until the current
talker releases the uplink or is released by the network (see subclause
11.3.7.1).
The value of timer T2 is operator specific. Its default value is 5 seconds.
### 13.1.4 Tbb
In a network supporting validation of Priority Uplink Requests, the timer Tbb
supervises the broadcast of a new token (Y) after a valid Priority Uplink
Request has been received.
If a Priority Uplink Request is received, and the token matches the token in
the BSS (X) then the request is accepted, token X is invalidated and Tbb is
started. On Tbb expiry a new token (Y), and the priority of the accepted
request, is sent in the uplink busy message on the FACCH of the voice group
call channels. The Tbb timer should be set to a value that allows other
service subscribers who sent a Priority Uplink Request with token X, at the
same time as the one accepted by the network, to be back on the voice group
call channel in order to receive the new token (Y).
The default value for Tbb is 500ms..
### 13.1.5 Ttv
In a network supporting validation of Priority Uplink Requests, the timer Ttv
supervises an additional validity period for an unused token (A). When T1
(supervising the periodic uplink busy) expires a new token (B) is sent in the
uplink busy message on the FACCH of the voice group call channels and timer
Ttv is started. If a Priority Uplink Request is received before Ttv expires
and the token matches either token in the BSS (A or B), the request is
considered to be valid, both tokens (A and B) in the BSS are invalidated and
Ttv is stopped. If Ttv expires (i.e. no valid Priority Uplink Request has been
received within Ttv seconds) the unused token (A) is invalidated.
The value of timer Ttv is operator specific. The value chosen should allow for
the reception of requests from service subscribers who have left the group
call channel before receipt of the UPLINK_BUSY with new token (B). Its default
value is 1s.
### 13.1.6 Tast
In a network supporting A-interface link sharing timer Tast shall be used to
measure the duration between periodic reports from the BSC to the MSC of Group
Call Area cells for which channels have been assigned or released, pre-empted
or failed since the last periodic report. When timer Tast expires, if new
cells in the Group Call Area have been established or existing ones have been
released, pre-empted or failed, the MSC shall be informed of the changes (see
subclause 7.1b). If no changes have occurred nothing shall be sent. Timer Tast
shall be restarted to measure the period of time until the next report. The
timer shall be stopped when the call is released.
The value of timer Tast is operator specific. Its default value is 5 seconds.
### 13.1.7 T3
In a RANflex configuration the group call serving MSC when receiving Send
Group Call Info from the VMSC shall supervise the setup of the group call by
timer T3. T3 is started when a positive Send Group Call Info result is
returned to the VMSC and it is stopped when the group call is set up. At
timeout the temporarily stored transient data are deleted from the GCR.
In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy T3 shall be implemented
in the GCR instead of in the MSC. T3 is started when initial talker
information is stored and stopped when initial talker information is deleted.
At timeout initial talker information is deleted from the GCR.
The value of timer T3 is operator specific. Its default value is 5 seconds.
