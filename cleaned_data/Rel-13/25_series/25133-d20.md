# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
The main general definitions strictly related to the Transmission and
Reception characteristics but important also for the present document can be
found in [3] for UE FDD, in [4] for BS FDD, in [5] for UE TDD, in [6] for BS
TDD.
**Node B:** A logical node responsible for radio transmission / reception in
one or more cells to/from the User Equipment. Terminates the Iub interface
towards the RNC
**Power Spectral Density:** The units of Power Spectral Density (PSD) are
extensively used in this document. PSD is a function of power versus frequency
and when integrated across a given bandwidth, the function represents the mean
power in such a bandwidth. When the mean power is normalised to (divided by)
the chip-rate it represents the mean energy per chip. Some signals are
directly defined in terms of energy per chip, (DPCH_E~c~, E~c~, OCNS_E~c~ and
S-CCPCH_E~c~) and others defined in terms of PSD (I~o~, I~oc~, I~or~ and
Î~or~). There also exist quantities that are a ratio of energy per chip to PSD
(DPCH_E~c~/I~or~, E~c~/I~or~ etc.). This is the common practice of relating
energy magnitudes in communication systems.\ It can be seen that if both
energy magnitudes in the ratio are divided by time, the ratio is converted
from an energy ratio to a power ratio, which is more useful from a measurement
point of view. It follows that an energy per chip of X dBm/3,84 MHz can be
expressed as a mean power per chip of X dBm. Similarly, a signal PSD of Y
dBm/3,84 MHz can be expressed as a signal power of Y dBm.
**MBSFN cluster:** Set of cells operating in MBSFN mode providing only MBMS
service in PtM mode and seen as one cell by a UE.
**Adjacent Frequency:** A downlink frequency in the inter-frequency cell info
list that is within 5 MHz from the intra frequency. It is explicitly indicated
by UTRAN to UE via upper layer signaling.
**Primary uplink frequency** : If a single uplink frequency is configured for
the UE, then it is the primary uplink frequency. In case more than one uplink
frequency is configured for the UE, then the primary uplink frequency is the
frequency on which the E-DCH corresponding to the serving E-DCH cell
associated with the serving HS-DSCH cell is transmitted. The association
between a pair of uplink and downlink frequencies is indicated by higher
layers.
**Secondary uplink frequency** : A secondary uplink frequency is a frequency
on which an E-DCH corresponding to a serving E-DCH cell associated with a
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is transmitted. The association between a pair
of uplink and downlink frequencies is indicated by higher layers.
**Activated Uplink Frequency:** For a specific UE, an uplink frequency is said
to be activated if the UE is allowed to transmit on that frequency. The
primary uplink frequency is always activated when configured while a secondary
uplink frequency has to be activated by means of an HS-SCCH order in order to
become activated.
**Normal Performance Group:** For UE which supports Increased UE carrier
monitoring UTRA or E-UTRA, the group of inter-frequency carriers or inter-RAT
carriers is divided into two groups. The group which has a better delay
performance compared to the other group is refered to as the normal
performance group.
**Reduced Performance Group:** For UE which supports Increased UE carrier
monitoring UTRA or E-UTRA the group of inter-frequency carriers or inter-RAT
carriers is divided into two groups. The group which has worse delay
performance compared to the other group is refered to as the reduced
performance group.
**eDRX cycles:** eDRX cycles and associated parameters are defined in TS
24.008 [32].

# 4 Idle Mode Tasks
## 4.1 Cell Selection
### 4.1.1 Introduction
After a UE has switched on and a PLMN has been selected, the Cell selection
process takes place, as described in TS25.304. This process allows the UE to
select a suitable cell where to camp on in order to access available services.
In this process the UE can use stored information (_Stored information cell
selection_) or not (_Initial cell selection_).
## 4.2 Cell Re-selection
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable cell
and camp on it.
When the UE is in either _Camped_ _Normally_ state or _Camped on Any Cell_
state on a FDD cell, the UE shall attempt to detect, synchronise, and monitor
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated in the
measurement control system information of the serving cell. UE measurement
activity is also controlled by measurement rules defined in TS25.304, allowing
the UE to limit its measurement activity if certain conditions are fulfilled.
### 4.2.2 Requirements
In the following sections, T~higher_priority_search~ is defined as (60 *
N~layers~) seconds when eDRX_IDLE is not configured, and as MAX(one eDRX_IDLE
cycle, 60 * N~layers~) when eDRX_IDLE is configured, where N~layers~ is the
total number of configured higher priority E-UTRA, UTRA FDD and UTRA TDD
carrier frequencies and is additionally increased by one if one or more groups
of GSM frequencies is configured as a higher priority.
For a UE which supports increased carrier monitoring UTRA or increased carrier
monitoring E-UTRA, the reselection performance for different carriers may be
configured by higher layers to be either normal or reduced. The following
definitions are used in the performance requirements:
> N~carrier~-1: Total number of FDD interfrequency carriers in the
> interfrequecny neighbour cell info list
>
> N~norm,inter~ = (N~carrier~-1- N~reduced,inter~): Number of FDD
> interfrequency carriers to be monitored with normal performance
>
> N~reduced,inter~: Number of FDD interfrequency carriers to be monitored with
> reduced performance
>
> K~carrier~: Total number of configured E-UTRA carriers in the neighbour cell
> list
>
> K~norm,E-UTRA~ =( K~carrier~ -- K~reduced,E-UTRA~): Number of E-UTRA
> carriers to be monitored with normal performance
>
> K~norm,E-UTRA,FDD~ : number of configured FDD E-UTRA carriers in the
> neighbour cell list to be monitored with normal performance
>
> K~norm,E-UTRA,TDD~ : number of configured TDD E-UTRA carriers in the
> neighbour cell list to be monitored with normal performance
>
> K~reduced,E-UTRA~: Number of E-UTRA carriers to be monitored with reduced
> performance
The minimum performance requirements for a UE which supports Increased UE
carrier monitoring UTRA [16, 31] are calculated as defined in sections 4.2.2.3
provided that N~norm,inter~ ≤2 for FDD and N~norm,inter~ ≤3 for TDD and the
minimum performance requirements for a UE which supports Increased UE carrier
monitoring E-UTRA [16, 31] are calculated as defined in sections 4.2.2.5a
provided that K~norm,E-UTRA~≤4 _for a UE capable of of either FDD E-UTRA
carrier monitoring or TDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring_ or K~norm,E-UTRA~≤8 _for
a UE capable of both FDD and TDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring provided_
K~norm,E-UTRA,FDD~ ≤4 _and_ K~norm,E-UTRA,TDD~ ≤4. In case the limits for the
number of normal performance carriers is exceeded, considering the broadcast
neighbour cell list and the bands supported by the UE, the UE which supports
Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA shall measure the first-listed 2 UTRA FDD
carriers in the _Inter-frequency cell info list_ with normal performance and
the UE capable of either FDD or TDD carrier monitoring which supports
Increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA shall measure the first-listed 4 E-UTRA
carriers, and a UE capable of both FDD/TDD carrier monitoring the first-listed
4 FDD E-UTRA carriers and first-listed 4 TDD E-UTRA carriers in _the Inter-RAT
cell info list,_ with normal performance. Additionally, reduced performance
requirements shall be met for carriers for which the _Reduced measurement
performance_ IE is indicated, up to the UE measurement capability in section
4.2.2.8a.
The minimum performance requirements for a UE which does not support Increased
UE carrier monitoring UTRA [16,31] are calculated assuming all UTRA carriers
required to be monitored for such UE, are having normal performance, i.e.
N~norm,inter~ = N~carrier~-1 and N~reduced,inter~ =0. The minimum performance
requirements for a UE which does not support Increased UE carrier monitoring
E-UTRA [16,31] are calculated assuming all E-UTRA carriers required to be
monitored for such UE, are having normal performance, i.e. K~norm,E-UTRA~ =
K~carrier~, and K~reduced,E-UTRA~ =0. Capabilities for number of carriers to
monitor for a UE which does not support Increased carrier monitoring E-UTRA or
Increased carrier monitoring UTRA are specified in section 4.2.2.8.
#### 4.2.2.1 Measurement and evaluation of cell selection criteria S of
serving cell
The UE shall, when eDRX_IDLE is not configured or when eDRX_IDLE cycle is
configured and eDRX_IDLE cycle is below or equal to 20.48s, measure the CPICH
Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP level of the serving cell and evaluate the cell selection
criterion S defined in [1] for the serving cell at least every DRX cycle. The
UE shall filter the CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP measurements of the serving
cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements used for
the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by, at least
T~measureFDD~/2 (see table 4.1).
The UE shall, when eDRX_IDLE is configured and eDRX_IDLE cycle is longer than
20.48s, measure the CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP level of the serving cell and
evaluate the cell selection criterion S defined in [1] for the serving cell at
least every DRX cycle within the PTW of each eDRX_IDLE cycle. The UE shall
filter the CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP measurements within the PTW of the
serving cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements
used for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by, at least
half of the DRX cycle length.
If the UE, when eDRX_IDLE is not configured or when eDRX_IDLE cycle is
configured and eDRX_IDLE cycle is below or equal to 20.48s, has evaluated in
N~serv~ consecutive measured DRX cycles that the serving cell does not fulfil
the cell selection criterion S, the UE shall initiate the measurements of all
neighbour cells indicated in the measurement control system information,
regardless of the measurement rules currently limiting UE measurement
activities.
If the UE when eDRX_IDLE is configured and eDRX_IDLE cycle is longer than
20.48s, has evaluated in MIN(N~serv,~ $\left\lceil
\frac{\text{PTW}}{\text{DRX}_{\text{cycle}_{\text{length}}}} \right\rceil$)
consecutive measured DRX cycles that the serving cell does not fulfil the cell
selection criterion S, the UE shall initiate the measurements of all neighbour
cells indicated in the measurement control system information, regardless of
the measurement rules currently limiting UE measurement activities.If the UE,
independent on if eDRX_IDLE is configured or not, has not found any new
suitable cell based on searches and measurements of the neighbour cells
indicated in the measurement control system information for 12 s, the UE shall
initiate cell selection procedures for the selected PLMN as defined in [1].
After this 12 s period a UE in Cell:PCH or URA_PCH is considered to be \"out
of service area\" and shall perform actions according to 25.331.
On transition from CELL_DCH to CELL_PCH/URA_PCH, if a UE cannot find a
suitable UTRA cell, then it is considered to be \"out of service area\" and
shall perform actions according to [16].
If the S criterion of the serving cell is no longer fulfilled, the UE may
suspend MBMS reception if necessary to improve the UE's ability to find a
suitable cell.
If the S criterion of the serving cell is fulfilled, the measurement
requirements when a MBMS reception is active are specified in sections 4.2.2.2
and 4.2.2.9.
#### 4.2.2.2 Measurements of intra-frequency cells
The UE shall, when eDRX_IDLE is not configured or when eDRX_IDLE cycle is
configured and eDRX_IDLE cycle is below or equal to 20.48s, measure CPICH
Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP at least every T~measureFDD~ (see table 4.1) for intra-
frequency cells that are identified and measured according to the measurement
rules. T~measureFDD~ is defined in Table 4.1. The UE shall filter CPICH Ec/Io
and CPICH RSCP measurements of each measured intra-frequency cell using at
least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the filtering,
at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least T~measureFDD~/2.
The filtering shall in this case be such that the UE shall be capable of
evaluating that an intra-frequency cell has become better ranked than the
serving cell within T~evaluateFDD~ (see table 4.1), from the moment the intra-
frequency cell became at least 3 dB better ranked than the current serving
cell, provided that Treselection timer is set to zero and either CPICH Ec/Io
or CPICH RSCP is used as measurement quantity for cell reselection. The UE
shall when eDRX_IDLE is configured and eDRX_IDLE cycle is longer than 20.48s,
measure CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP at least 2 times during the PTW every
eDRX_IDLE cycle for intra-frequency cells that are identified and measured
according to the measurement rules. The UE shall filter CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH
RSCP measurements of each measured intra-frequency cell using at least 2
measurements from the same PTW. Within the set of measurements used for the
filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least half the DRX
cycle.
The filtering shall in this case be such that the UE shall be capable of
evaluating that an intra-frequency cell has become better ranked than the
serving cell within one eDRX_IDLE cycle from the moment the intra-frequency
cell became at least 3 dB better ranked than the current serving cell,
provided that Treselection timer is set to zero and either CPICH Ec/Io or
CPICH RSCP is used as measurement quantity for cell reselection.
If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the intra-frequency cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this intra-
frequency cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains better ranked
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.
If the UE is receiving the MTCH, the UE shall to be able to identify new
intra-frequency cells and take them into use for MTCH combining purposes as
defined in section 8.4.2.2.1
#### 4.2.2.3 Measurements of inter-frequency FDD cells
If priority information for UTRA FDD carrier frequencies is provided in the
measurement control systems information and Srxlev~ServingCell~ >
S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~ > S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE
shall search for any higher priority UTRA inter-frequency cells at least every
T~higher_priority_search~ where T~higher_priority_search~ is described in
section 4.2.2. If the UE is not in CELL_PCH, URA_PCH or IDLE state then the UE
shall search for UTRA FDD layers of higher priority within
T~higher_layer_start~ upon entering into any of these states. If 1 second has
not elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving cell when the UE enters
into any of these states, T~higher_layer_start~ is one DRX cycle plus 1
second; otherwise T~higher_layer_start~ is one DRX cycle. If higher priority
UTRA cells are found by the higher priority search, they shall be measured
when eDRX_IDLE is not configured or is configured with a eDRX_IDLE cycle less
than or equal 20.48s at least every (N~carrier~-1) * T~measureFDD~. When
eDRX_IDLE is configured with a eDRX_IDLE cycle longer than 20.48s they shall
be measured at least with two measurements during the PTW in each eDRX_IDLE
cycle. If, after detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is
determined that reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to
continuously measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of
reselection. However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified
later in this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any
determination that it may stop measuring the cell. If priority information for
UTRA FDD carrier frequencies is provided in the measurement control systems
information and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \ S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~ >
S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for and measure GSM cells if the
priority of GSM is higher than the serving cell. The minimum rate at which the
UE is required to search for and measure such layers may be reduced in this
scenario to maintain UE battery life.
When the measurement rules defined in [1] indicate that inter-RAT cells are to
be measured then the UE shall measure, the signal level of the GSM BCCH
carriers if the GSM BCCH carriers are indicated in the measurement control
system information of the serving cell. GSM BCCH carriers of lower priority
than the serving cell shall when eDRX_IDLE_IDLE is not configured or eDRX_IDLE
is configured with a eDRX_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s be measured at
least every T~measure,GSM~ (see table 4.1). When eDRX_IDLE is configured with
a eDRX_IDLE cycle longer than 20.48s serving cell shall be measured at least 4
times during the PTW within every eDRX_IDLE cycle length.
If Srxlev~ServingCell~ > S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~ >
S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for GSM BCCH carrier at least
every T~higher_priority_search~ where T~higher_priority_search~ is described
in section 4.2.2. If the UE is not in CELL_PCH, URA_PCH or IDLE state then the
UE shall search for GSM layers of higher priority within T~higher_layer_start~
upon entering into any of these states. If 1 second has not elapsed since the
UE camped on the current serving cell when the UE enters into any of these
states, T~higher_layer_start~ is one DRX cycle plus 1 second; otherwise
T~higher_layer_start~ is one DRX cycle. When higher priority GSM BCCH carriers
are found by the higher priority search when eDRX_IDLE is not configured or
eDRX_IDLE is configured with a eDRX_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s, they
shall be measured at least every T~measure,GSM,~ and the UE shall decode the
BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier. When eDRX_IDLE is configured with a eDRX_IDLE
cycle longer than 20.48s, they shall be measured at least 4 times during the
PTW in every eDRX_IDLE cycle length~,~ and the UE shall decode the BSIC of the
GSM BCCH carrier.
If, after detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that
reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously
measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection
to continuously verify the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier every MIN(30s,
eDRX_IDLE cycle length). However, the minimum measurement filtering
requirements specified later in this section shall still be met by the UE
before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring the cell. If
Srxlev~ServingCel**l** ~ \ S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~ >
S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for E-UTRA layers of higher
priority at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If the UE is not in
CELL_PCH, URA_PCH or IDLE state then the UE shall search for E-UTRA layers of
higher priority within T~higher_layer_start~ upon entering into any of these
states. If 1 second has not elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving
cell when the UE enters into any of these states, T~higher_layer_start~ is one
DRX cycle plus 1 second; otherwise T~higher_layer_start~ is one DRX cycle. The
minimum rate at which the UE is required to search for and measure such layers
may be reduced in this scenario to maintain UE battery life.
If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \ \- RSRP\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.1.1 for a corresponding Band
The UE shall measure RSRP and RSRQ at least every K~norm,\ EUTRA~ *
T~measureE-UTRA~ for normal performance group and K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ * 6 *
T~measureE-UTRA~ for reduced performance group as defined in table 4.2 for
identified E-UTRA cells.
The UE shall when eDRX_IDLE is configured with a eDRX_IDLE cycle longer than
20.48s for the normal performance group and if Srxlev\ \- RSRP\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.1.1 for a corresponding Band
The UE shall measure RSRP and RSRQ at least 2 times every eDRX_IDLE cycle time
for normal performance group and if Srxlev\ T~IU~ T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available
> PRACH occasion in the new cell.T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.
NOTE: The actual value of T~IU~ shall depend upon the PRACH configuration used
in the target cell.
In the interruption requirement a cell is known if
\- it has been meeting the relevant cell identification requirements during
the last 5 seconds otherwise it is unknown. Relevant cell identification
requirements are described in [24].
The interruption time requirements for an unknown target cell shall apply only
if the signal quality of the unknown target cell is sufficient for successful
synchronisation with one attempt.
## 5.4b FDD to E-UTRAN TDD Handover
### 5.4b.1 Introduction
The purpose of inter-RAT handover from UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD is to transfer
a connection between the UE from UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD. The handover
procedure is initiated from UTRAN with a RRC message (HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND). The procedure is described in TS 25.331 section 8.3.7.
Compressed mode according to the UE Capability may be used to be able to make
measurements on E-UTRAN.
### 5.4b.2 Requirements
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and E-UTRAN
TDD.
#### 5.4b.2.1 Handover delay
When the UE receives a RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message, the UE shall
be ready to start the transmission of the new uplink PRACH channel within
D~handover~ seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command.
Where:
D~handover~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay defined plus the
interruption time stated in section 5.4b.2.2.
The UE shall process the RRC procedures for the RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND within 50 ms, which is noted as RRC procedure delay.
#### 5.4b.2.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between the end of the last TTI containing
the RRC command on UTRA and the time the UE starts transmission of the new
PRACH on E-UTRA cell, excluding the RRC procedure delay. This requirement
applies when the UE is not required to perform any synchronisation procedure
before transmitting on the new PRACH.
When inter-RAT handover to E-UTRAN is commanded, the interruption time shall
be less than Tinterrupt
Tinterrupt = T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms
Where:
> T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the target
> cell is not already known when the handover command is received by the UE.
> If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target cell is
> unknown and signal quality is sufficient for successful cell detection on
> the first attempt, then T~search~ = 80 ms.
>
> T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH
> occasion in the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.
NOTE: The actual value of T~IU~ shall depend upon the PRACH configuration used
in the target cell.
In the interruption requirement a cell is known if it has been meeting the
relevant cell identification requirement during the last 5 seconds otherwise
it is unknown. Relevant cell identification requirements are described in
[24].

ensure the testability of autonomous CSG search, and are only applicable when
the 2^nd^ DRX cycle is configured, with a DRX cycle length of equal to or
greater than 1280msec.
Reselection from non CSG to CSG cells may be performed using UE autonomous
search as defined in [1] when at least one CSG ID is included in the UE's
**CSG** white**list**. The requirements in this section are valid for
reselection to CSG cells previously visited by the UE when the radio
configuration parameters, including the carrier frequency and physical cell
identity of the CSG cell, non CSG cell and other neighbour cells are unchanged
from the most recent previous visit.
NOTE: According to [1], the UE autonomous search function, per UE
implementation, determines when and/or where to search for allowed CSG cells.
##### 5.5.2.1A.1 Reselection from a non CSG FDD to an inter-frequency FDD CSG
cell
The UE shall perform search and reselection to an allowed inter-frequency FDD
CSG cell that has met CSG reselection criterion defined in [1] and that is in

autonomous CSG search or reselection to the CSG cell, the UE shall also meet
the exsiting cell reselection requirements defined in section
5.5.2.1.1-5.5.2.1.5. Where applicable, the interruption time requirement of

cell that has met CSG reselection criterion defined in [1] and that is in its
whitelist, within 6 minutes in the conditions shown in table 5.3B. There is no
need for statistical testing of this requirement. When performing autonomous
CSG search or reselection to the CSG cell, the UE shall also meet the exsiting
cell reselection requirements defined in section 5.5.2.1.1-5.5.2.1.5. Where

In CELL_FACH state the MTCH interruption time due to intra-frequency cell
reselection without soft combining during an MBMS session shall be less than
T~MTCH_interrupt~ as specified in section 4.2.2.10.
##### 5.5.2.2.2 FDD-TDD cell reselection
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and TDD.

$T_{\text{S-criteria}} = 5 \times T_{\text{Measurement_Period\ Intra}}$ms
where
T~Measurement_Period\ Intra~ = Specified in 8.4.2.2.2.

the serving cell does not fulfil the cell selection criterion S and if the UE
has not found any new suitable cell based on searches and measurements of the
neighbour cells indicated in the measurement control system information during
these 4 s. When the UE is \"out of service area\" it shall initiate cell
selection procedures for the selected PLMN as defined in [1].
On transition from CELL_DCH to CELL_FACH, if a UE cannot find a suitable UTRA
cell, then it is considered to be \"out of service area\" and shall perform
actions according to [16].
If the S criterion of the serving cell is no longer fulfilled, the UE may
suspend MBMS reception if necessary to improve the UE's ability to find a
suitable cell.

transmission delay.
N~RACH~ is the number of cells requiring SFN decoding prior to the reporting
of SFN-SFN observed time difference measurement results on RACH.
## 5.9 Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN in CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH
### 5.9.1 Introduction
The purpose of inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN FDD to GSM is to
transfer a connection between the UE and UTRAN FDD to GSM. This procedure may
be used in CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH state. The cell change order procedure is
initiated from UTRAN with a RRC message (CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN). The
procedure is described in TS25.331 section 8.3.11.
NOTE: No procedure is defined for Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN to
E-UTRAN.
### 5.9.2 Requirements
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and GSM.
#### 5.9.2.1 Delay
When the UE receives a RRC CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN COMMAND with the
activation time \"now\" or earlier than the value in table 5.4 from the end of
the last TTI containing the RRC command, the UE shall start transmit the
random access in the target cell of the new RAT within the value in table 5.4
from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command.
If the access is delayed to an indicated activation time later than the value
in table 5.4 from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command, the UE
shall start transmit the random access in the target cell of the new RAT at
the designated activation time.
The UE shall process the RRC procedures for the RRC CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM
UTRAN COMMAND within 50 ms. If the activation time is used, it corresponds to
the CFN of the UTRAN channel.

* * *
where
T~BCCH~ = the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from the GSM cell [21];
T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure.
#### 5.9.2.2 Interruption time
The requirements on interruption time below is valid when the signal quality
of the serving cell is good enough to allow decoding of the old channel during
the inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN delay.
The interruption time, i.e. the time between the end of the last TTI
containing a transport block that the UE is able to receive on the old channel
and the time the UE starts transmit the random access in the target cell,
shall be less than the value in table 5.5. The requirement in table 5.5 for
the case, that UE is not synchronised to the GSM cell before the CELL CHANGE
ORDER FROM UTRAN COMMAND is received, is valid when the signal quality of the
GSM cell is good enough for successful synchronisation with one attempt.

T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure
## 5.10 Serving HS-DSCH cell change
### 5.10.3 Introduction
The serving HS-DSCH procedure is initiated from UTRAN with a RRC message that
implies a change of the serving HS-DSCH cell, see TS 25.331 section 8.2.2
### 5.10.2 Requirements
#### 5.10.2.1 Serving HS-DSCH cell change delay
Procedure delay for all procedures, that can command a HS-DSCH cell change are
specified in TS25.331 section 13.5.2.
When the UE receives a RRC message implying HS-DSCH cell change with the
activation time \"now\" or earlier than RRC procedure delay seconds from the
end of the last TTI containing the RRC command, the UE shall be ready to
receive the HS-SCCH channel from the new cell within D~cell_change~ seconds
from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command.
If the access is delayed to an indicated activation time later than RRC
procedure delay seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command, the UE shall be ready to start the transmission of the new uplink HS-
DPCCH at the designated activation time + interruption time.
where:
D~cell_change~ equals the RRC procedure delay defined in TS25.331 Section
13.5.2 plus the interruption time of receiving HS-DSCH data stated in section
5.10.2.2.
#### 5.10.2.2 Interruption time
The HS-DSCH interruption time is the time between the last received TTI that
can contain a transport block on the old HS-PDSCH and the time when the UE is
ready to transmit CQI reports based on the quality of the new cell and the UE
have started to receive the HS-SCCH of the new cell. The interruption time is
depending on whether the target cell is known for the UE or not.
If serving HS-DSCH cell change is commanded to a cell in the active set the
HS-DSCH interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt1
Tinterrupt1=T~IU~+22 ms
If an active set update, which includes a cell into the active set where the
cell is known, and serving HS-DSCH cell change is simultaneously commanded to
the same cell the HS-DSCH interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt2
Tinterrupt2=T~IU~+42 ms
where T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty when changing the timing from the
old to the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to one subframe (2 ms).
The phase reference is the primary CPICH.
## 5.11 Enhanced Serving HS-DSCH cell change
### 5.11.1 Introduction
The enhanced serving HS-DSCH cell change procedure is initiated from UTRAN
either with a RRC message that implies a change of the serving HS-DSCH cell or
through an HS-SCCH order sent on the target cell (target cell is the cell
which becomes the serving cell after the enhanced serving HS-DSCH cell change
procedure).
### 5.11.2 Requirements
When the UE receives a RRC message implying enhanced HS-DSCH cell change, the
serving cell change delay and interruption time requirements are as defined in
Section 5.10.
When the UE receives an HS-SCCH order from the target cell that implies
enhanced HS-DSCH serving cell change:
\- if the activation time is not equal to "now", the UE shall be ready to
receive the full configured HS-SCCH set from the target cell within MAX{40 ms,
activation time -- the end of the TTI containing the HS-SCCH order} from the
end of the TTI containing the HS-SCCH order.
\- if the activation time is set to "now", the UE shall be ready to receive
the full configured HS-SCCH set within 40 ms from the end of the TTI
containing the HS-SCCH order.
## 5.12 Interruption on Primary Uplink Frequency in DC-HSUPA
### 5.12.1 Introduction
When the UE is configured with dual uplink carrier frequencies, the
transmission interruption on the primary uplink frequency can occur due to the
activation or deactivation of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell or of the
serving E-DCH cell on the secondary uplink frequency.
The activation or deactivation procedure for the secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell or the serving E-DCH cell on the secondary uplink frequency, is initiated
from UTRAN with an HS-SCCH order [18], which implies activation or
deactivation of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell or the serving E-DCH cell
on the secondary uplink frequency.
### 5.12.2 Requirements
The interruption time on the primary uplink frequency, T~interrupt~, starts
from the end of the last DPCCH slot which overlaps with the HS-DPCCH subframe
containing the ACK corresponding to the HS-SCCH order for the activation or
deactivation of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell or the serving E-DCH cell
on the secondary uplink frequency. The UE shall be ready to resume
transmission of each physical channel on the primary uplink frequency at the
next slot, subframe or frame after T~interrupt~ =4 ms, depending on the
channel timing relationship defined in [2] (next slot for DPCCH and next
subframe for HS-DPCCH/2ms TTI E-DCH). This requirement applies when the UE is
configured with dual uplink carrier frequencies.
## 5.13 System information acquisition for CSG cell
### 5.13.1 Introduction
The requirements in this section apply to a UE which supports system
information acquisition of a CSG cell in preparation for handover. Both intra
frequency and inter frequency system information reading can be configured,
for the inter frequency case the UE may make autonomous gaps in both downlink
reception and uplink transmission. For intrafrequency system information
acquisition, interruption in downlink reception or uplink tranmission shall
not be performed to aquire system information.
### 5.13.2 CSG SI acquisition delay
The CSG SI acquisition delay is defined as the time between any occurrences
that will trigger a SI decoding until the UE starts to transmit over the Uu
interface. This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed
by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. The measurement reporting delay also
excludes any RRC procedure delay which is defined in [16] when SI reading is
initiated by a measurement control message.
For intra frequency CSG cells, CSG SI decoding is typically triggered when a
cell with primary scrambling code in a preconfigured range meets the criteria
for measurement reporting. For inter frequency CSG cells, CSG SI decoding is
explicitly requested by RRC signalling.
The CSG SI reporting delay shall not be more than T~CSG-SI-Report~ where
T~CSG-SI-Report~ in ms is given by
T~CSG-SI-Report~ = 630+ 40*SIB3_REP
SIB3_REP is the repetition period at which the CSG cell schedules SIB3 blocks
in units of frames
This requirement is applicable for CSG target cell configurations where the
information required to make the SI report can be determined from the MIB and
SIB3 alone, and SIB3 is not segmented into multiple TTI. Additionally, for the
requirement to be applicable, the reception conditions shall be such that the
system frame number of the target CSG cell, the MIB and SIB3 can each be
successfully decoded in no more than four attempts. According to the reception
conditions:
A cell shall be considered detectable when:
\- CPICH Ec/Io [>]{.underline} -20 dB if DL_DRX_Active = 0, or CPICH Ec/Io
≥-17dB if DL_DRX_Active=1,
\- SCH_Ec/Io [>]{.underline} -20 dB if DL_DRX_Active = 0, or SCH Ec/Io ≥-17dB
if DL_DRX_Active=1, for at least one channel tap and SCH_Ec/Ior is equally
divided between primary synchronisation code and secondary synchronisation
code. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
The system frame number, the MIB and SIB3 of the target CSG cell shall be
considered decodable provided the BCH demodulation requirements are met
according to [3].
### 5.13.3 Interfrequency CSG decoding interruption
When inter frequency CSG SI decoding of a neighbour cell is requested by
UTRAN, the UE may interrupt ongoing downlink reception, and uplink
transmission to perform the decoding on another frequency. The total of the
gaps in reception and the total of the gaps in transmission during the period
T~CSG-SI-Report~ shall not exceed T~CSG-SI-Interruption~ where T~CSG-SI-
Interruption~ = 600ms. This requirement is applicable for CSG target cell
configurations where the information required to make the SI report can be
determined from the MIB and SIB3 alone, and SIB3 is not segmented into
multiple TTI. Additionally, for the requirement to be applicable, the
reception conditions shall be such that the system frame number of the target
CSG cell, the MIB and SIB3 can each be successfully decoded in no more than
four attempts. According to the reception conditions:
A cell shall be considered detectable when:
\- CPICH Ec/Io > -20 dB,
\- SCH_Ec/Io > -17 dB for at least one channel tap and SCH_Ec/Ior is equally
divided between primary synchronisation code and secondary synchronisation
code. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
The system frame number, the MIB and SIB3 of the target CSG cell shall be
considered decodable provided the BCH demodulation requirements are met
according to [3].
### 5.13.4 CSG reporting delay
Reporting delay results from delay uncertainty when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI
of the uplink DCCH.
## 5.14 System information acquisition for inter-RAT E-UTRA cell
### 5.14.1 Identification of a new CGI of inter-RAT E-UTRA FDD cell with
autonomous gaps
The UE shall identify and report the CGI when requested by the UTRAN for the
purpose of SI reading. To perform SI reading, the UE may make autonomous gaps
in both downlink reception and uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1
message of E-UTRAN cell [27] when the IE \" E-UTRA SI Acquisition\" is
received by the UE [16]. If the autonomous gaps are used for the measurement
with the purpose of SI reading, the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of
inter-RAT E-UTRA cell within:
$T_{\text{identify_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{basic}_{\text{identify_CGI,\
E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$
Where
> T~basic_identify_CGI,\ E-UTRAN~ = [300] ms. This is the time period used in
> the above equation where the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify a
> new CGI of E-UTRA cell is defined.
A E-UTRAN cell shall be considered identifiable following conditions are
fulfilled:
\- RSRP related side conditions given in Section 9.1of [24] are fulfilled for
a corresponding Band,
\- SCH_RP\|dBm and SCH Ês/Iot according to Annex B.4.1 for a corresponding
Band.
The MIB of an inter-RAT E-UTRA cell whose CGI is identified shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation requirements are
met according to [28].
### 5.14.2 Identification of a new CGI of inter-RAT E-UTRA TDD cell with
autonomous gaps
The UE shall identify and report the CGI when requested by the UTRAN for the
purpose of SI reading. To perform SI reading, the UE may make autonomous gaps
in both downlink reception and uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1
message [27] when the IE \" E-UTRA SI Acquisition\" is received by the UE
[16]. If the autonomous gaps are used for the measurement with the purpose of
SI reading, the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of inter-RAT E-UTRA
cell within:
$T_{\text{identify_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{basic}_{\text{identify_CGI,\
E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$
Where
T~basic_identify_CGI,\ E-UTRAN~ = [300] ms. This is the time period used in
the above equation where the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify a new
CGI of E-UTRA cell is defined.
A cell shall be considered identifiable following conditions are fulfilled:
\- RSRP related side conditions given in Section 9.1 of [24] are fulfilled for
a corresponding Band,
\- SCH_RP and SCH Ês/Iot according to Annex B.4.1 for a corresponding Band.
The MIB of an inter-RAT E-UTRA cell whose CGI is identified shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation requirements are
met according to [28].
### 5.14.3 ECGI reporting delay
Reporting delay results from delay uncertainty when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH and the RRC procedure delay. The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
## 5.15 Packet Loss Rate on Serving HS-DSCH Cells in Multi-Carrier HSDPA
### 5.15.1 Introduction
A UE according to its measurement capability in the IE, "Inter-frequency
measurements on configured carriers without compressed mode" defined in
section 10.3.3.21 of TS 25.331 [16] may reconfigure its receiver bandwidth
when performing measurements on configured carrier frequencies corresponding
to secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. This may cause loss of HS-DSCH reception
from those primary and secondary serving HS-DSCH cells whose carrier
frequencies belong to the same frequency band as that of the measured
configured secondary carrier frequency.
### 5.15.2 Requirements
The probability of not sending ACK/NACK corresponding to HS-DSCH transmitted
to a UE by its primary or secondary serving HS-DSCH cell shall not exceed 4%
when the UE measures cells on any configured secondary carrier frequency which
belongs to the same frequency band as that of the primary or secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell.
# 6 RRC Connection Control
## 6.1 RRC Re-establishment
### 6.1.1 Introduction
RRC connection re-establishment is needed, when a UE in state CELL_DCH loses
radio connection due to radio link failure. The procedure when a radio link
failure occurs in CELL_DCH is specified in TS 25.331.
### 6.1.2 Requirements
The requirements in this section are applicable when the UE performs a RRC Re-
establishment to a cell belonging to any of the frequencies present in the
previous (old) monitored set.
The UE _moves from CELL_DCH to CELL_FACH state and_ shall be capable of
sending a CELL UPDATE message using the cause \"radio link failure\" within
T~RE-ESTABLISH~ seconds from when the radio link failure occurred.
T~RE-ESTABLISH~ equals the RRC procedure delay (T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~) according
to TS25.331 plus the UE Re-establishment delay (T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~),
specified in 6.1.2.1.
T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~
#### 6.1.2.1 UE Re-establishment delay requirement
The UE Re-establishment delay requirement (T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~) is defined
as the time between the moment when radio link failure is considered by the
UE, to when the UE starts to send preambles on the PRACH.
T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~ is depending on whether the target cell is known by the
UE or not. A cell is known if either or both of the following conditions are
true:
\- the UE has had radio links connected to the cell in the previous (old)
active set;
\- the cell has been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds.
And the phase reference is the primary CPICH.
The UE Re-establishment delay requirement T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~ shall be less
than
T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~ =50ms+T~search~ + T~SI~+ T~RA~
in case that the target cell is known, and
T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-UNKNOWN~ =50ms+T~search~*NF + T~SI~ + T~RA~
in case that the target cell is not known by the UE.
where
_T~search~_ is the time it takes for the UE to search the cell.
_T~search~_ =100 ms if the target cell is known by the UE, and
_T~search~_ =800 ms if the target cell is not known by the UE.
_T~SI~_ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms).
T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access procedure.
_NF_ is the number of different frequencies in the monitored set.
This requirement assumes radio conditions to be sufficient, so that reading of
system information can be done without errors.

## 6.3 Random Access
### 6.3.1 Introduction
The random access procedure is used when establishing the layer 1
communication between the UE and UTRAN. The random access shall provide a fast
access but without disturbing ongoing connections. The random access is
specified in section 6 of TS 25.214 and the control of the RACH transmission
is specified in section 11.2 of TS 25.321. A random access transmit sequence
is described in section 6.7.2 of TS 25.303. The UE procedure for selecting 2
or 10 msec TTI when operating Enhanced Uplink in CELL_FACH is specified in
3GPP TS 25.321 [19].
### 6.3.2 Requirements
The UE shall have capability to calculate initial power according to the open
loop algorithm and apply this power level at the first preamble and increase
the power on additional preambles. The UE shall stop transmit preambles upon a
ACK/NACK on the AICH has been received or if the maximum number of preambles
within on cycle has been reached. Upon an ACK has been received the UE shall
transmit a message otherwise the ramping procedure shall be repeated.
#### 6.3.2.1 Correct behaviour when receiving an ACK
The UE shall stop transmitting preambles upon a ACK on the AICH has been
received and then transmit a message..
The absolute power applied to the first preamble shall have an accuracy as
specified in table 6.3 of TS 25.101 [3]. The relative power applied to
additional preambles shall have an accuracy as specified in section 6.5.2.1 of
25.101 [3].
#### 6.3.2.2 Correct behaviour when receiving an NACK
The UE shall stop transmitting preambles upon a NACK on the AICH has been
received and then repeat the ramping procedure when the back off timer T~B01~
expires.
#### 6.3.2.3 Correct behaviour at Time-out
The UE shall stop transmit preambles when reaching the maximum number of
preambles allowed in a cycle. The UE shall then repeat the ramping procedure
until the maximum number of preamble ramping cycles are reached.
#### 6.3.2.4 Correct behaviour when reaching maximum transmit power
The UE shall not exceed the maximum allowed UL TX power configured by the
UTRAN.
The absolute power of any preamble shall not exceed the maximum allowed UL TX
power with more than specified in section 6.5.
#### 6.3.2.5 Correct behaviour when selecting 2 or 10msec TTI length for
Enhanced Uplink in CELL_FACH state and idle mode
A UE that is capable of 2/10msec TTI selection shall select a preamble
signature assigned to 2msec TTI when the TX power headroom based on the TX
power on the current preamble according to the method specified in [19] is
greater than the threshold value configured by UTRAN plus an accuracy value of
6 dB. The UE shall select a preamble assigned to the 10msec TTI when the TX
power headroom based on the TX power calculated on the current preamble
according to the method specified in [19] is lower than the threshold value
configured by UTRA minus the accuracy value 6 dB. Otherwise, the UE may select
a preamble signature assigned to either 2msec or 10msec TTI.
## 6.4 Transport format combination selection in UE
### 6.4.1 Introduction
When the UE estimates that a certain TFC and E-TFC would require more power
than the maximum transmit power, it shall limit the usage of transport format
combinations for the assigned transport format set, according to the
functionality specified in section 11.4 in TS25.321. This is in order to make
it possible for the network operator to maximise the coverage. Transport
format combination selection is described in section 11.4 of TS 25.321.
When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE estimates the
power which may be allocated for all Activated Uplink Frequencies. The E-TFC
selection when the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency is
described in section 11.8.1.4 of TS25.321
### 6.4.2 Requirements
The UE shall continuously evaluate based on the _Elimination,_ _Recovery and
Blocking_ criteria defined below, how TFCs on an uplink DPDCH can be used for
the purpose of TFC selection. The evaluation shall be performed for every TFC
in the TFCS using the estimated UE transmit power.
The UE transmit power estimation for a given TFC, when HS-DPCCH and S-DPCCH
are not transmitted during the measurement period, shall be calculated using
the DPDCH and DPCCH gain factors of the corresponding TFC and reference
transmit power. The reference transmit power is the transmit power of DPCCH
and DPDCH of a given TFC during the measurement period for which UE transmit
power estimation is made. If a single HS-DPCCH is transmitted either partially
or totally within the given measurement period the UE transmit power
estimation for a given TFC shall be calculated using DPDCH and DPCCH gain
factors, the maximum value of the HS-DPCCH gain factor that is used during the
measurement period, and the reference transmit power. If two HS-DPCCHs are
transmitted either partially or totally within the given measurement period
then a maximum combined transmit power over both of the HS-DPCCHs should be
considered in the TFC calculation. Rules for calculating the HS-DPCCH gain
factors from the most recent signalled ∆~ACK~, ∆~NACK~ and ∆~CQI~ according to
the specific multicarrier and MIMO configuration and activation status of the
secondary HS-DSCH serving cells are defined in subclause 5.1.2.5A in [18]. The
timing of the measurement period, which is defined in 9.1.6.1 as one slot, is
the same as the timing of the DPCH slot. If S-DPCCH is transmitted within the
given measurement period, the UE transmit power for a given TFC shall be
calculated using the DPDCH and DPCCH gain factors, the HS-DPCCH power as
described above if one or two HS-DPCCH(s) are present, the S-DPCCH gain
factor, and the reference transmit power.
E-TFC selection is allowed only in CELL_DCH state, CELL_FACH state, and Idle
mode. E-TFC selection is based on the estimated power leftover from TFC
selection if the DPDCH is present and from the HS-DPCCH.
When the UE has one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE shall estimate the
normalised remaining power margin available for E-TFC selection based on the
following equations for E-TFC candidate j
NRPM~j~= (PMax ~j~ - P~DPCCH,target~ - P~S-DPCCH~ - P~DPDCH~- P~HS-DPCCH~-
P~E-DPCCH,j~)/ P~DPCCH,\ target~ (1),
NRPM~j~= 0.5 * (PMax ~j~ - P~DPCCH,target~ - P~S-DPCCH~ - P~HS-DPCCH~-
P~E-DPCCH,j~ -- P~S-E-DPCCH,j~)/ P~DPCCH,\ target~ (2),
where
Equation (2) is used when estimating the candidate E-TFCs for potential rank-2
transmissions for UL MIMO, and equation (1) in used in all other cases.
PMax~j~ = Maximum UE transmitter power for E-TFC-j as defined in section 6.5
P~DPCCH~(t) represents a slotwise estimate of the current UE DPCCH power at
time t. If at time t, the UE is transmitting a compressed mode frame then
P~DPCCH,comp~(t) = P~DPCCH~(t) × (N~pilot,C~/ N~pilot,N~) else
P~DPCCH,comp~(t) = P~DPCCH~(t). If the UE is not transmitting uplink DPCCH
during the slot at time t, either due to compressed mode gaps or when
discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission operation is enabled then the power
shall not contribute to the filtered result.Samples of P~DPCCH,comp~(t) shall
be filtered using a filter period of 3 slotwise estimates of P~DPCCH,comp~(t)
when the E-DCH TTI is 2ms or 15 slotwise estimates of P~DPCCHcomp~(t) when the
E-DCH TTI is 10ms to give P~DPCCH,filtered.~The accuracy of the P~DPCCH~
estimate shall be at least that specified in table 6.0A
If the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j~ evaluated does not correspond to a
compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,target\ =~ P~DPCCH,filtered~.
If the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j~ is being evaluated corresponds to a
compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,target\ =~ P~DPCCH,filtered~× (N~pilot,N~/
N~pilot,C~). N~pilot,N~ and N~pilot,C~ are numbers of pilot symbols as defined
in [18].
P~DPDCH~ = estimated DPDCH transmit power, based on P~DPCCH,target~ and the
gain factors from the TFC selection that has already been made. If the target
E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j~ is being evaluated corresponds to a compressed
mode frame then the modification to the gain factors which occur due to
compressed mode shall be included in the estimate of P~DPDCH.~
P~HS-DPCCH~ = estimated HS-DPCCH transmit power based on the maximum HS-DPCCH
gain factor and P~DPCCH,target~ If two HS-DPCCHs are transmitted, P~HS-DPCCH~
is the maximum combined estimated transmit power over both HS-DPCCHs. Rules
for calculating the HS-DPCCH gain factors from the most recent signalled
∆~ACK~, ∆~NACK~ and ∆~CQI~ according to the specific multicarrier and MIMO
configuration and activation status of the secondary HS-DSCH serving cells are
defined in subclause 5.1.2.5A in [18]. If the target E-DCH TTI for which
NRPM~j~ is being evaluated corresponds to a compressed mode frame then the
modification to the gain factors which occur due to compressed mode shall be
included in the estimate of P~HS-DPCCH~.
P~E-DPCCH,j~ = estimated E-DPCCH transmit power for E-TFCI~j~, as follows:.
\- For estimating the remaining power margin for a single transport block in
an E-DCH TTI (UL MIMO not configured, or rank1 with UL MIMO configured); If
E-TFCI~j~ is smaller than or equal to _E-TFCI~ec,boost~_ the estimate is based
on P~DPCCH,target~ and the E-DPCCH gain factor calculated using the most
recent signalled value of ∆~E-DPCCH~. If E-TFCI~j~ is greater than _E-
TFCI~ec,boost~_ the estimate is based on the E-DPCCH gain factor,_β~ec,j~_ ,
which is calculated for E-TFCI~j~ using the procedure in [18]. If the target
E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j~ is being evaluated corresponds to a compressed
mode frame then the modification to the gain factors which occur due to
compressed mode shall be included in the estimate of P~E-DPCCH~
\- For estimating the remaining power margin for transmission of two transport
blocks in an E-DCH TTI (Rank2 UL MIMO); The estimate is based on the E-DPCCH
gain factor,_β~ec,j~_ , which is calculated for E-TFCI~j~ using the procedure
in [18] assuming _E-TFCI~ec,boost~_ = -1.
P~S-E-DPCCH,j~ = estimated S-E-DPCCH transmit power for E-TFCI~j~. The
estimate is based on the S-E-DPCCH gain factor,_β~sec,j~_ , which is
calculated for E-TFCI~j~ as defined in [18].
P~S-DPCCH~ = estimated S-DPCCH transmit power, based on P~DPCCH,target~ and
the S-DPCCH gain factor. In case neither the uplink CLTD operation nor uplink
MIMO operation is configured or one of the two is configured with CLTD
activation state 2 or 3, P~S-DPCCH~ is considered as zero.
NOTE: P~DPCCH~(t), PMax ~j~, P~DPCCH,target~, P~DPCCH,filtered~,
P~DPCCH,comp~(t), P~DPDCH~, P~HS-DPCCH~, P~S-DPCCH~, P~E-DPCCH~ and P~S-E-
DPCCH~ are expressed in linear power units
In CELL_FACH state and Idle mode, if less than 3 E-DCH TTIs of DPCCH
transmission for 2ms TTI and less than 2 E-DCH TTIs of DPCCH transmission for
10ms TTI is configured prior to the start of the E-DCH transmissions, an
estimate of P~DPCCH,\ target~ = P~preamble~ + P~p-e~ shall be used for initial
E-TFC restriction. P~preamble~ is the code power of the last transmitted PRACH
preamble, and P~p-e~ is the power offset between the power of the last
transmitted preamble and the initial DPCCH transmission power.
The UE shall consider the _Elimination_ criterion for a given TFC to be
detected if the estimated UE transmit power needed for this TFC is greater
than the Maximum UE transmitter power for at least X out of the last Y
successive measurement periods immediately preceding evaluation. The MAC in
the UE shall consider that the TFC is in Excess-Power state for the purpose of
TFC selection.
MAC in the UE shall indicate the available bit rate for each logical channel
to upper layers within T~notify~ from the moment the _Elimination_ criterion
was detected.
The UE shall consider the _Recovery_ criterion for a given TFC to be detected
if the estimated UE transmit power needed for this TFC has not been greater
than the Maximum UE transmitter power for the last Z successive measurement
periods immediately preceding evaluation. The MAC in the UE shall consider
that the TFC is in Supported state for the purpose of TFC selection.
MAC in the UE shall indicate the available bit rate for each logical channel
to upper layers within T~notify~ from the moment the _Recovery_ criterion was
detected.
The evaluation of the _Elimination_ criterion and the _Recovery_ criterion
shall be performed at least once per radio frame.
The definitions of the parameters X,Y and Z which shall be used when
evaluating the _Elimination_ and the _Recovery_ criteria when no compressed
mode patterns are activated are given in Table 6.0.
Table 6.0: X, Y, Z parameters for TFC selection
* * *
X Y Z 15 30 30
* * *
The UE shall consider the _Blocking_ criterion for a given TFC to be fulfilled
at the latest at the start of the longest uplink TTI after the moment at which
the TFC will have been in Excess-Power state for a duration of:
(T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1_proc~)
where:
T~notify~ equals 15 ms, and
T~modify~ equals MAX(T~adapt_max~,T~TTI~), and
T~L1\ proc~ equals 15 ms, and
T~adapt_max~ equals MAX(T~adapt_1~, T~adapt_2~, ..., T~adapt_N~), and
N equals the number of logical channels that need to change rate, and
T~adapt_n~ equals the time it takes for higher layers to provide data to MAC
in a new supported bitrate, for logical channel n. For services where no codec
is used T~adapt~ shall be considered to be equal to 0 ms. For services where
either UMTS_AMR2 or UMTS_AMR_WB is used, Tadapt shall be considered to be
equal to the time required to switch from the current codec mode to a new
supported codec mode. In that case Tadapt equals 20 ms + 40 ms per codec mode
switch. E.g. Tadapt equals 60ms if one codec mode switch is necessary and
Tadapt equals 140ms if 3 codec mode switches are necessary.
T~TTI~ equals the longest uplink TTI of the selected TFC (ms).
When the UE has one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE shall be able to update
the normalised remaining power estimate of each E-TFC at least every E-DCH
TTI. The UE shall use the latest available estimate of NRPM~j~ at the time
when all absolute and relative grants relating to the E-DCH TTI under
consideration have been received. Using the estimates of NRPM~j~ the UE shall
evaluate for each E-TFC which configured MAC-d flows are supported and which
are unsupported as follows:
In the case that the target E-DCH TTI for which E-TFC restriction is being
considered does not belong to a compressed mode frame then if NRPM~j~≥
∑(β~ed,j~/β~c~)^2^ then E-TFC~j~ can be supported, otherwise it cannot be
supported
In the case that the target E-DCH TTI for which E-TFC restriction is being
considered belongs to a compressed mode frame then if NRPM~j~≥
∑(β~ed,C,j~/β~c,C~)^2^ then E-TFC~j~ can be supported, otherwise it cannot be
supported
β~ed,j~/β~c~ and β~ed,C,j~/β~c,C~ is the quantized amplitude ratio.
If the UE is allowed to reduce its maximum transmit power for certain TFCs and
E-TFCs, the UE shall use the reduced maximum transmit power in the evaluation
of the TFC and E-TFC selection criteria for those TFCs.
When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE shall
estimate the remaining power which is available to be allocated to scheduled
E-DCH transmissions on all Activated Uplink Frequencies. The total available
power for scheduled E-DCH transmissions is defined by:
P~remaining,s~=max(PMax - Σ~i~ P~DPCCH,target,i~ - P~HS-DPCCH~ - P~DPDCH~ -
P~non-SG~, 0)
where
PMax represents the Maximum UE Transmitter power, as defined in Section 6.5.
\- P~DPCCH,i~(t) represents a slotwise estimate of the current UE DPCCH power
for carrier with index i (i=0,1) at time t. If at time t, the UE is
transmitting a compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,comp,i~(t) = P~DPCCH,i~(t) ×
(N~pilot,C~/ N~pilot,N~) else P~DPCCH,comp,i~(t) = P~DPCCH,i~(t). If the UE is
not transmitting uplink DPCCH on the Activated Uplink Frequency i during the
slot at time t, either due to compressed mode gaps or when discontinuous
uplink DPCCH transmission operation is enabled then the power shall not
contribute to the filtered result. Samples of P~DPCCH,comp,i~(t) shall be
filtered using a filter period of 3 slotwise estimates of P~DPCCH,comp,i~(t).
The accuracy of the P~DPCCH,i~ estimate shall be at least that specified in
table 6.0A
If the target E-DCH TTI for which RPM is being evaluated does not correspond
to a compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,target,i\ =~ P~DPCCH,filtered,i~.
If the target E-DCH TTI for which RPM is being evaluated corresponds to a
compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,target,i\ =~ P~DPCCH,filtered,i~×
(N~pilot,N~/ N~pilot,C~). N~pilot,N~ and N~pilot,C~ are numbers of pilot
symbols as defined in [18].
\- P~HS-DPCCH~ represents the estimated HS-DPCCH transmit power and shall be
calculated based on the estimated Primary Activated Frequency DPCCH power, and
the greatest HS-DPCCH gain factor. If two HS-DPCCHs are transmitted, P~HS-
DPCCH~ is the maximum combined estimated transmit power from both HS-DPCCHs.
Rules for calculating the HS-DPCCH gain factors from the most recent signalled
∆~ACK~, ∆~NACK~ and ∆~CQI~ according to the specific multicarrier and MIMO
configuration and activation status of the secondary HS-DSCH serving cells are
defined in subclause 5.1.2.5A in [18].
\- P~DPDCH~ represents estimated DPDCH transmit power on Primary Activated
Frequency based on P~DPDCH,target~ and the gain factors from the TFC selection
that has already been made. If the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPMj is being
evaluated corresponds to a compressed mode frame then the modification to the
gain factors which occur due to compressed mode shall be included in the
estimate of P~DPDCH~.
\- P~non-SG~ represents the power pre-allocated for non-scheduled
transmissions for Primary Uplink Frequency, as defined by [19]. An estimate of
the E-DPCCH power required for non-scheduled transmissions may be included in
P~non-SG~ .
When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency and no retransmission
is required, or when the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency and
two retransmissions are required, the UE shall estimate the normalised
remaining power margin available for E-TFC selection using the power allocated
to the Primary Uplink Frequency P~allocated,1~ and the power allocated to the
Secondary Uplink Frequency P~allocated,2~ defined by:
> P~allocated,1~ = P~1~ +P~non-SG,~
>
> P~allocated,2~ = P~2~
where
P~i~ represents the maximum remaining allowed power for scheduled
transmissions for the Activated Uplink Frequency i = 1,2, where index 1 and
index 2 correspond to the index of the Primary Uplink Frequency and the index
of the Secondary Uplink Frequency as defined by [19]
When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency and one
retransmission is required in one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE shall
estimate the normalised remaining power margin available for E-TFC selection
using the power allocated to the Activated Uplink Frequency for which a
retransmission is required P~allocated,x~ and on the power allocated to the
Activated Uplink Frequency for which no retransmission is required
P~allocated,y~ defined by:
> P~allocated,y~= PMax - P~HS-DPCCH~ - Σ~i~ P~DPCCH,target,i~ - P~DPDCH~ \-
> P~E-DPCCH,x~ - P~E-DPDCH,x~
>
> P~allocated,x~= P~E-DPCCH,x~ + P~E-DPDCH,x~
where
P~E-DPDCH,x~ represents the estimated E-DPDCH transmit power for the Uplink
Frequency for which a retransmission is required. The estimate is based on
P~DPCCH,target,x~ where x is denoting the index of the Activated Uplink
Frequency on which a retransmission required and the E-DPDCH gain factor which
will be used for the retransmission.
P~E-DPCCH,x~ represents the estimated E-DPCCH transmit power for the Uplink
Frequency for which a retransmission is required. The estimate is based on
P~DPCCH,target,x~ where x is denoting the index of the Activated Uplink
Frequency on which a retransmission is required and the E-DPCCH gain factor
which will be used for the retransmission.
When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE shall
estimate the normalised remaining power margin available for E-TFC selection
for the Activated Uplink Frequency i based on the following equation for E-TFC
candidate j:
NRPM ~i,j~ = (P~allocated,\ i~ -- P~E-DPCCHi,i~) / P~DPCCH,,target,i~
where
P~E-DPCCH,j,i~ represents the estimated E-DPCCH transmit power for E-TFCI~j~
on the Activated Uplink Frequency i. If E-TFCI~j~ is smaller than or equal to
_E-TFCI~ec,boost~_ the estimate is based on P~DPCCH,target,i~ and the E-DPCCH
gain factor calculated using the most recent signalled value of ∆~E-DPCCH~. If
E-TFCI~j~ is greater than _E-TFCI~ec,boost~_ the estimate is based on the
E-DPCCH gain factor,_β~ec,j~_ , which is calculated for E-TFCI~j~ using the
procedure in [18]. If the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j,i~ is being
evaluated corresponds to a compressed mode frame then the modification to the
gain factors which occur due to compressed mode shall be included in the
estimation.
In the case that the target E-DCH TTI for which E-TFC restriction is being
considered does not belong to a compressed mode frame then if NRPM~j,i~≥
∑(β~ed,j~/β~c~)^2^ then E-TFC~j~ can be supported on the Activated Uplink
Frequency i, otherwise it cannot be supported on that Activated Uplink
Frequency.
In the case that the target E-DCH TTI for which E-TFC restriction is being
considered belongs to a compressed mode frame then if NRPM~j,i~≥
∑(β~ed,C,j~/β~c,C~)^2^ then E-TFC~j~ can be supported on the Activated Uplink
Frequency i, otherwise it cannot be supported on that Activated Uplink
Frequency.
β~ed,j~/β~c~ and β~ed,C,j~/β~c,C~ is the quantized amplitude ratio.

For E-TFC selection, when the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency
in DC-HSUPA and DB-DC-HSUPA, the UE is allowed to account for maximum power
reduction at any point in the procedure described in Section 6.4.2. The total
E-TFC MPR applied across the Activated Uplink Frequencies shall not exceed the
maximum value specified in [3].
## 6.6 (void)
## 6.7 CSG Proximity Indication for E-UTRAN and UTRAN
### 6.7.1 Introduction
The requirements defined in this section are applicable to a UE supporting and
configured with CSG proximity indication and are valid when a UE is entering
the proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) or leaving the proximity of
all CSG member cell(s) on a UTRA or E-UTRA frequency as specified in [16].
The detection of CSG proximity is based on a UE autonomous search function.
### 6.7.2 Requirements
The UE shall initiate transmission of the _ProximityIndication_ message with
\"entering\" according to [16] within [6] minutes after entering the proximity
of one or more CSG member cell(s) on a UTRA or E-UTRA frequency.
The UE shall initiate transmission of the _ProximityIndication_ message with
\"leaving\" according to [16] within [6] minutes after leaving the proximity
of all CSG member cell(s) on a UTRA or E-UTRA frequency.
There is no need for statistical testing of this requirement.
NOTE: Entering the proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) means that the
UE is near a cell whose CSG ID is in the UE\'s CSG whitelist (as determined
based on autonomous search procedures). Leaving the proximity of one or more
CSG member cell(s) means that the UE is no longer near any cell whose CSG ID
is in the UE\'s CSG whitelist.
## 6.8 10ms Mode/20ms Mode switching in DCH
### 6.8.1 Introduction
When DL_DCH_FET_Config [7] is configured by higher layers, the UE shall
continuously evaluate based on the _Restrict and Revive_ criteria defined
below, what transmission mode can be used for each TFC on an uplink DPDCH. The
evaluation shall be performed for every TFC in the TFCS using the estimated UE
transmit power using 10ms Mode β~c~ and β~d~ gain factors, if signalled by
higher layers.
### 6.8.2 Requirements
The UE shall estimate the transmit power for a TFC in 10ms Mode, following the
procedure in Subclause 6.4 using β~c~ and β~d~ gain factors corresponding to
10ms Mode.
The UE shall consider the _Restrict_ criterion for a given TFC transmission
mode to be detected if the estimated UE transmit power needed for this TFC
using the 10ms Mode is greater than the Maximum UE transmitter power for at
least K out of the last M successive measurement periods immediately preceding
evaluation.
The UE shall consider the _Revive_ criterion for a given TFC to be detected if
the estimated UE transmit power needed for this TFC using the 10ms Mode has
not been greater than the Maximum UE transmitter power for the last L
successive measurement periods immediately preceding evaluation.
The evaluation of the _Restrict_ criterion and the _Revive_ criterion shall be
performed at least once per radio frame, except if UL DPCCH is DTXed according
to Subclause 6C.2 of [18] in all slots in one radio frame.
The parameters K, L and M are signalled by the higher layers.
# 7 Timing and Signalling characteristics
## 7.1 UE Transmit Timing
### 7.1.1 Introduction
The UE shall have capability to follow the frame timing change of the
connected Node B. The uplink DPCCH/DPDCH frame transmission takes place
approximately T~0~ chips after the reception of the first detected path (in
time) of the corresponding downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH frame, from the
reference cell. T~0~ is defined in [2]. UE initial transmit timing accuracy,
maximum amount of timing change in one adjustment, minimum and maximum
adjustment rate are defined in the following requirements.
### 7.1.2 Requirements
The UE initial transmission timing error shall be less than or equal to ±1.5
Chips. This requirement applies at the first transmission on the DPCCH/DPDCH.
The reference point for the UE initial transmit timing control requirement
shall be the time when the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding
downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH frame is received from the reference cell plus
T~0~ chips. T~0~ is defined in [2].
When the UE is not in soft handover, the reference cell shall be the one the
UE has in the active set. **In case the UE is initially allocated in soft
handover, the reference cell shall be the same cell as used for calculating
the initial CFN as defined in [16].**
The cell, which is selected as a reference cell, shall remain as a reference
cell even if other cells are added to the active set. In case that the
reference cell is removed from the active set the UE shall start adjusting its
transmit timing no later than the time when the whole active set update
message is available at the UE taking the RRC procedure delay into account.
When the UE has performed a timing-maintained intra- or inter-frequency hard
handover and higher layers has indicated that the UE shall not perform any
synchronisation procedure for timing maintained intra- or inter-frequency hard
handover, or when the UE attempts to re establish all dedicated physical
channel(s) after an inter-RAT, intra- or inter-frequency hard-handover failure
[18], it shall resume UL transmission with the same transmit timing as used
immediately before the handover attempt. After resuming transmission, transmit
timing adjustment requirements defined in the remainder of this clause apply.
The UE shall be capable of changing the transmission timing according to the
received downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH frame. When the transmission timing
error between the UE and the reference cell exceeds ±1.5 chips the UE is
required to adjust its timing to within ±1.5 chips.
All adjustments made to the UE timing shall follow these rules:
1) The maximum amount of the timing change in one adjustment shall be ¼ Chip.
2) The minimum adjustment rate shall be 233ns per second.
3) The maximum adjustment rate shall be ¼ chip per 200ms.
In particular, within any given 800*d ms period, the UE transmit timing shall
not change in excess of ±d chip from the timing at the beginning of this 800*d
ms period, where 0≤d≤1/4.
## 7.2 UE Receive - Transmit Time Difference
### 7.2.1 Introduction
The UE shall have the capability to be in soft handover with more than one
cell. The downlink DPCH frame timing or the downlink F-DPCH frame timing shall
take place approximately T~0~ chips before the transmission of the uplink
DPDCH/DPCCH. The adjustment requirements for the uplink DPDCH/DPCCH timing are
specified in 7.1.1. The valid range of the Receive to Transmit time difference
at the UE is defined in the following requirements.
### 7.2.2 Requirements
A UE shall support reception, demodulation and combining of signals of a
downlink DPCH, or a downlink F-DPCH, when the receive timing is within a
window of T~0~ +/- 148 chip before the transmit timing where T~0~ is defined
in [2].
For downlink DPCH a UE is only required to react to TPC commands with a
transmit power adjustment in the immediate next slot if the downlink receive
timing of all cells in the active set is within a window of T~0~ +/- 148 chip
before the uplink transmit timing.
For downlink F-DPCH, a UE is only required to react to TPC commands with a
transmit power adjustment in the immediate next slot after the end of the TPC
command combining period as defined in [18] if the downlink receive timing of
all cells in the active set is within a window of T~0~ +/- 148 chip before the
uplink transmit timing.
If the downlink receive timing of one or more cells in the active set is
outside the window of T~0~ +/- 148 chip, the UE may also react with a power
adjustment one slot later. The receive timing is defined as the first detected
path in time.
## 7.3 UE timer accuracy
### 7.3.1 Introduction
UE timers are used in different protocol entities to control the UE behaviour.
### 7.3.2 Requirements
For UE timers T3xx, T~barred~, Treselection, Penalty_time, T~CRmax~,
T~CrmaxHyst~ [16], UE shall comply with the timer accuracies according to
Table 7.1.
The requirements are only related to the actual timing measurements internally
in the UE. They do not include the following:
\- Inaccuracy in the start and stop conditions of a timer (e.g. UE reaction
time to detect that start and stop conditions of a timer is fulfilled), or
\- Inaccuracies due to restrictions in observability of start and stop
conditions of a UE timer (e.g. TTI alignment when UE sends messages at timer
expiry).

In addition to the requirements defined above, a UE supporting E-UTRA
measurements shall be capable of monitoring a minimum total of at least 9
carrier frequency layers, including the two intra-frequency carriers and
comprising of any above defined combination of E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA TDD, UTRA
FDD, UTRA TDD and GSM layers (one GSM layer corresponds to 32 cells).
If the UE utilises compressed mode for inter-frequency and/or inter-RAT
measurements, in order for the requirements in the following subsections to
apply the UTRAN must:

Performance requirements for different types of transmission gap pattern
sequences and different number of cells is defined in the following sections.
The requirements in section 9 are applicable for a UE performing measurements
according to this section.
The received CPICH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as
$\ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} =
\left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} -

capable of monitoring a total of at least 13 carrier frequency layers, which
includes serving layer, comprising of any above defined combination of _of

corresponds to 32 cells)_.
#### 8.1.2.2 FDD intra frequency measurements
During the CELL_DCH state the UE shall continuously measure identified intra
frequency cells and search for new intra frequency cells in the monitoring
set. In case the network requests the UE to report detected set cells, the UE
shall also search for intra frequency cells outside the monitored and active
set. Cells, which are neither included in the active set nor in the monitored
set, and are identified by the UE belong to the detected set according to TS
25.331. If compressed mode pattern sequences are activated, intra frequency
measurements can be performed between the transmission gaps simultaneously for
data reception from the active set cell/s. If DL_DRX_Active=1, and the UE is
performing DRX, intra frequency measurements can be performed when the
receiver is active, simultaneously to data reception from the active set
cell/s.
The performance of intra frequency measurements when IPDL is active has not

CPICH measurements defined in Section 8.1.2.2.2.

##### 8.1.2.2.2 UE CPICH measurement capability
In the CELL_DCH state the measurement period for intra frequency measurements
is 200 ms. When no transmission gap pattern sequence is activated and
DL_DRX_Active=0, the UE shall be capable of performing CPICH measurements for
8 identified-intra-frequency cells of the monitored set and/or the active set,
and the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to higher
layers with the measurement period of 200 ms. When one or more transmission
gap pattern sequences are activated, and/or DL_DRX_Active=1, the UE shall be
capable of performing CPICH measurements for at least Y~measurement\ intra~
cells , where Y~measurement\ intra~ is defined in the following equation. The
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in the sub-
clause 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. If the UE has identified more than Y~measurement\
intra~ cells, the UE shall perform measurements of all identified cells but
the reporting rate of CPICH measurements of cells from UE physical layer to
higher layers may be decreased.
$Y_{\text{measurement}\ \text{\ intra}} = \text{Floor}\left{ X_{\text{basic}\
\text{measurement}\ \text{FDD}} \cdot
\frac{T_{\text{Intra}}}{T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\ Intra}}}
\right}$ cells
where
X~basic\ measurement\ FDD~ = 8 (cells)
T~Measurement_Period\ Intra~ = 200 ms. The measurement period for Intra
frequency CPICH measurements.
T~Intra~ : This is the minimum time that is available for intra frequency
measurements, during the measurement period with an arbitrarily chosen timing.
If DL_DRX_Active=1, and the UE is performing DRX, intra frequency measurements
are assumed only to be performed when the receiver is guaranteed to be active,
and simultaneously to data reception from the active set cell/s.
T~basic_identify_FDD,\ intra~ = 800 ms. This is the time period used in the
intra frequency equation where the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify
a new FDD cell is defined.
The UE shall furthermore be capable of performing CPICH measurements for at
least 1 detected intra-frequency cell, in the detected set, and the UE
physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to higher layers

the requirements specified in section 8.1.2.2.3 Event Triggered Reporting.
##### 8.1.2.2.5 Event Triggered Reporting
Reported measurements contained in event triggered measurement reports shall
meet the requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit over the Uu
interface. This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed
by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes
a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI
of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay, on cells belonging to
monitored set, measured without L3 filtering, shall be less than the above
defined T~identify\ intra~ defined in Section 8.1.2.2.1
If a cell, belonging to monitored set, which the UE has identified and
measured at least once over the measurement period, becomes undetectable for a
period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an
event, the measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement_Period\ Intra~ ms provided the timing to that cell has not
changed more than +/-32 chips, the UE CPICH measurement capabilities of
section 8.1.2.2.2 are valid and L3 filtering has not been used. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
If a cell belonging to monitored set has been detectable at least for the time
period T~identify_intra~ and then triggers the measurement report as per TS
25.331, section 14 [16], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~Measurement_Period\ Intra~ when the L3 filter has not been used
and the UE CPICH measurement capabilities of Section 8.1.2.2.2 are valid.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay on cells not belonging to
monitored set, measured without L3 filtering, shall be less than the above
defined T ~identify\ detected\ set~ defined in Section 8.1.2.2.1.
#### 8.1.2.3 FDD inter frequency measurements

measurements\" purpose is provided by the network the UE shall continuously
measure identified inter frequency cells and search for new inter frequency
cells indicated in the measurement control information.
In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply the UTRAN

\text{measurement}\ \text{TDD\ inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement\
Period\ \ TDD\ inter}}}{N_{\text{TDD\ inter}}} \cdot N_{\text{Freq}}
\right}\text{ms}$
If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform inter-frequency TDD
measurements, the measurement period for inter-frequency TDD measurements
shall be 480 ms.
The UE shall be capable of performing P-CCPCH RSCP measurements for X~basic\
measurement\ TDD\ inter~ inter-frequency TDD cells per TDD frequency of the
monitored set and the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting

##### 8.1.2.4.3 Periodic Reporting
Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet

##### 8.1.2.4.4 Event Triggered Reporting
Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report, until the UE starts to transmit the
measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that the
measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH.. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulting when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering
shall be less than T~identify\ TDD\ inter~ defined in Section 8.1.2.4.1 When
L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
#### 8.1.2.5 GSM measurements
The requirements in this section apply only to UE supporting FDD and GSM.
Measurements on GSM cells can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified.
1) In CELL_DCH state when a transmission gap pattern sequence is provided by
the UTRAN the UE shall continuously measure GSM cells and search for new GSM
cells given in the monitored set.
2) If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform GSM measurements:
\- the UE shall measure all GSM cells present in the monitored set
\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel is
assigned in TS 45.008 shall apply. This is further detailed in the following
sub-sections.
##### 8.1.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI
1) For a UE requiring compressed mode
A UE supporting GSM measurements using compressed mode shall meet the minimum
number of GSM RSSI carrier measurements specified in table 8.4. This
measurement shall be based on a transmission gap pattern sequence with purpose
\"GSM carrier RSSI measurements\"
In order for the requirements in this subsection to apply the UTRAN must
provide a transmission gap pattern sequence with measurement purpose GSM
carrier RSSI measurements using the following combinations for TGL1, TGL2 and
TGD:
Table 8.3
* * *
TGL1 [slots] TGL2 [slots] TGD [slots] 3 - undefined 4 - undefined 5 -
undefined 7 - undefined 10 - undefined 14 - undefined 3 3 15...269 4 4
15...269 5 5 15...269 7 7 15...269 10 10 41...269 14 14 45...269
* * *
In the CELL_DCH state the measurement period, T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~,
for the GSM carrier RSSI measurement is 480 ms.
The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV in
TS45.008, when the given measurement time allows the UE to take at least 3 GSM
carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set during the
measurement period.
Table 8.4
* * *
TGL Number of GSM carrier RSSI samples in each gap. 3 1 4 2 5 3 7 6 10 10 14
15
* * *
In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per GSM
carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many GSM
carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3 samples
per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during that
measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement periods.
This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting period to higher
layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the measurement period.
2) For a UE not requiring compressed mode
The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly
distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received signal level
measurement samples are required per RSSI value. The measurement period is 480
ms.
##### 8.1.2.5.2 BSIC verification
1) For a UE requiring compressed mode
In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply the UTRAN
must provide a transmission gap pattern sequence with measurement purpose GSM
Initial BSIC identification or with measurement purpose GSM BSIC re-
confirmation, using the following combinations for TGL1, TGL2 and TGD:
Table 8.5
* * *
TGL1 [slots] TGL2 [slots] TGD [slots] 5 - undefined 7 - undefined 10 -
undefined 14 - undefined 5 5 15...269 7 7 15...269 10 10 41...269 14 14
45...269
* * *
The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into the
following two tasks:
**Initial BSIC identification**
Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding the BSIC for the first time when
there is no knowledge about the relative timing between the FDD and GSM cell.
The UE shall trigger the initial BSIC identification within the available
transmission gap pattern sequence with purpose \"GSM Initial BSIC
identification\". The requirements for Initial BSIC identification can be
found in 8.1.2.5.2.1.
**BSIC re-confirmation**
Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after initial BSIC identification
is performed. The UE shall trigger the BSIC re-confirmation within the
available transmission gap pattern sequence with purpose \"GSM BSIC re-
confirmation\". The requirements for BSIC re-confirmation can be found in
8.1.2.5.2.2.
Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall be
able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those cells where the
verification of BSIC has been successful.
If the network requests measurements on a GSM cell with BSIC verified, the UE
shall behave as follows:
\- The UE shall perform GSM carrier RSSI measurements according to Section
8.1.2.5.1 when ever a transmission gap pattern sequence with the purposes
\"GSM carrier RSSI measurements\" is provided and the UE shall perform
measurement reporting as defined in Section 8.6.7.6 of [16].
\- The UE shall perform BSIC identification according to Section 8.1.2.5.2.1
when a \"GSM Initial BSIC identification\" transmission gap pattern sequence
is activated. The UE shall use the last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement
results for arranging GSM cells in signal strength order for performing BSIC
identification.
\- The UE shall perform BSIC re-confirmation according to Section 8.1.2.5.2.2
when a \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation\" transmission gap pattern sequence is
activated.
\- If a \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation\" transmission gap pattern sequence is not
activated in parallel to a \"GSM Initial BSIC identification\" transmission
gap pattern sequence or within one frame from the deactivation of a \"GSM
Initial BSIC identification\" transmission gap pattern sequence, the BSIC
shall be considered to be non-verified after 10s has elapsed after the UE
identified the BSIC of the cell..
The UE shall perform event evaluation for event-triggered reporting after the
BSIC has been verified for a GSM cell. The UE shall use the last available GSM
carrier RSSI measurement results in event evaluation and event-triggered
reporting. Periodic reports shall be triggered according to Sections 8.6.7.5
and 8.6.7.6 of [16].
The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has decoded
the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one time (initial
BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall be re-confirmed at
least once every T~re-confirm_abort~ seconds. Otherwise the BSIC of the GSM
cell is considered as \"non-verified\". If a transmission gap pattern sequence
with a purpose \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation \" is not activated by the network
after BSIC identified or the \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation \" transmission gap
pattern sequence is deactivated, the UE shall behave as described previously
in this section.
The parameters N~identify_abort~ and T~re-confirm_abort~ are defined by higher
layers and are signalled to the UE together with the transmission gap pattern
sequence. N~identify_abort~ indicates the maximum number of patterns that the
UE shall use to attempt to decode the unknown BSIC of the GSM cell in the
initial BSIC identification procedure. T~re-confirm_abort~ indicates the
maximum time allowed for the re-confirmation of the BSIC of one GSM cell in
the BSIC re-confirmation procedure.
The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC within a transmission gap when the time
difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation burst at the
UE and the middle of the effective transmission gap is within the limits
specified in table 8.6.
The effective transmission gap is calculated by assuming both UL and DL
compressed mode and applying the worst-case values for UL/DL timing offset and
pilot field length of last DL gap slot.
Table 8.6: The gap length and maximum time difference for BSIC verification
+------------+-------------------------+ | Gap length | Maximum time difference | | | | | [slots] | [μs] | +------------+-------------------------+ | 5 | ± 500 | +------------+-------------------------+ | 7 | ± 1200 | +------------+-------------------------+ | 10 | ± 2200 | +------------+-------------------------+ | 14 | ± 3500 | +------------+-------------------------+
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
TS 45.005.
2) For a UE not requiring compressed mode
If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, it is considered as
\"verified\", else it is considered as \"non verified\".
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
TS 45.005.
###### 8.1.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification
This measurement shall be based on a transmission gap pattern sequence with
the purpose \"GSM Initial BSIC identification\"
For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall attempt to
decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the 8 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM
cells indicated in the measurement control information. The UE shall give
priority for BSIC decoding attempts in decreasing signal strength order to
BSIC carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the
BCCH carrier having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value after layer 3
filtering. The GSM signal strength levels used in BSIC identification for
arranging GSM cells in signal strength order shall be based on the latest GSM
carrier RSSI measurement results available.
When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with unknown
BSIC, the UE shall use all available transmission gaps, within the
transmission gap pattern sequence with the purpose \"GSM Initial BSIC
identification\", to attempt to decode the BSIC from that GSM BCCH carrier.
If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE shall
immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH carrier, in
signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has
been successfully identified shall be moved to the BSIC re-confirmation
procedure.
If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier within
N~identify_abort~ successive patterns, the UE shall abort the BSIC
identification attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to
try to perform BSIC identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal
strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification failed
shall not be re-considered for BSIC identification until BSIC identification
attempts have been made for all the rest of the 8 strongest GSM BCCH carriers
in the monitored set with unknown BSIC.
N~identify_abort~ values are given for a set of reference patterns in table
8.7. T~identify_abort~ is the elapsed time during N~identify_abort~
transmission gap patterns (informative). The figures given in table 8.7
represent the number of patterns required to guarantee at least two attempts
to decode the BSIC for one GSM BCCH carrier.

###### 8.1.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation
The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC re-confirmation.
The UE shall maintain the timing information of 8 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC identification.
The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is decoded.
For each transmission gap of a transmission gap pattern sequence with the
measurement purpose \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation\", the UE shall attempt to
decode the BSIC falling within the effective gap duration. If more than one
BSIC can be decoded within the same gap, priority shall be given to the least
recently decoded BSIC.
If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts or if the UE
has not been able to re-confirm the BSIC for a GSM cell within T~re-
confirm_abort~ seconds, the UE shall abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts
for that GSM cell. The GSM cell shall be treated as a new GSM cell with
unidentified BSIC and the GSM cell shall be moved to the initial BSIC
identification procedure, see section 8.1.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be able to
make BSIC re-confirmation attempts for the 8 strongest GSM cells in the
monitored list.
N~re-confirm_abort~ is the number of transmission gap patterns executed during

##### 8.1.2.5.3 Periodic Reporting
Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.
##### 8.1.2.5.4 Event Triggered Reporting
Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria is not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit the
measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that that
the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH.
This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH . The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
The event triggered reporting delay requirement is valid when the UE for each
GSM carrier in the monitored set can take the required number of samples
during the measurement period T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ (see section
8.1.2.5.1).
The event triggered measurement reporting delay for a GSM cell with verified
BSIC, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than 2*T~Measurement\
Period,\ GSM~, where T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ is defined in Section
8.1.2.5.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected. For
a GSM cell with non-verified BSIC an additional delay according to section
8.1.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification can be expected.
#### 8.1.2.6 E-UTRAN measurements
The requirements in this section apply only to UEs supporting UTRAN FDD and
E-UTRAN FDD and TDD.
1) In CELL_DCH state when a transmission gap pattern sequence is provided by
the UTRAN the UE shall continuously measure previously detected E-UTRAN cells
and search for new E-UTRAN cells.
> In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply the
> UTRAN must provide a transmission gap pattern sequence with measurement
> purpose \"E-UTRAN measurement\" using the following combinations for TGL1,
> TGL2, TGD and Max TGPL:

2) If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements:
\- the UE shall measure either all E-UTRAN cells present in the monitored set
or, if only frequencies are provided in the neighbour cell list, the strongest
cells present in the detected set, up to the monitoring capabilities of the
UE.
> \- the relevant requirements for E-UTRAN RRC_CONNECTED mode specified in
> 3GPP TS 36.133 [24] shall apply. This is further detailed in the following
> subclauses.
##### 8.1.2.6.1 Identification of a new cell
When compressed mode gaps are used for E-UTRAN measurements, the UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable E-UTRAN cell within
$T_{\text{Identify,E-UTRAN}} = K_{n} \cdot N_{\text{freq},E - \text{UTRA},n}
\cdot T_{\text{Basic_Identify_E-UTRAN\ }} \cdot
\frac{\text{480}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$(normal performance) and
$T_{\text{Identify,E-UTRAN}} = K_{r} \cdot N_{\text{freq},E - \text{UTRA},r}
\cdot T_{\text{Basic_Identify_E-UTRAN\ }} \cdot
\frac{\text{480}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$(reduced performance);
If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements, the
UE shall be able to identify a new detectable E-UTRAN cell within
$T_{\text{Basic_Identify_E-UTRAN\ }}$ ms.
Where:
> T~E-UTRAN~: This is the minimum time that is available for E-UTRAN
> measurements during a 480ms period with an arbitrarily chosen timing. The

##### 8.1.2.6.2 E-UTRAN RSRP and RSRQ measurement period
When compressed mode gaps are scheduled for E-UTRAN measurements the UE
physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to higher layers
with measurement accuracy as specified in sub-clause 9.1.4a and 9.1.4b with
measurement period of T~Measurement_Period_E-UTRAN~ =480 x K~n~ x
N~freq,E-UTRA,n~ ms (normal performance) and T~Measurement_Period_E-UTRAN~
=480 x K~r~ x N~freq,E-UTRA,r,~ (reduced performance) where N~freq,E-UTRA,n~
and N~freq,E-UTRA,r~ are defined in section 8.1.2.6.
The UE shall be capable of performing RSRP and RSRQ measurements of at least 4
E-UTRAN cells per E-UTRAN frequency, according to its supported UE
capabilities. Additionally, _for a UE supporting E-UTRA measurements in Cell-
DCH state, the UE shall be capable of monitoring a minimum total of at least
13 carrier frequency layers, including the intrafrequency serving layer and
comprising of any allowed combination of E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD,
UTRA TDD and GSM layers (one GSM layer corresponds to 32 cells)._
##### 8.1.2.6.3 Periodic reporting
Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.
##### 8.1.2.6.4 Void
##### 8.1.2.6.5 Event Triggered reporting
Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria is not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit the
measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that the
measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH . The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering
shall be less than T ~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ defined in Section 8.1.2.6.1When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
If a cell has been detectable at least for the time period than T ~identify\
,E-UTRAN~ and then triggers the measurement report as per TS 25.331, section
14 [16], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement_Period_E-UTRAN~ provided the timing to that cell has not changed
more than ± 50 Ts while transmission gap has not been available and the L3
filter has not been used.
## 8.2 Measurements in CELL_DCH State with special requirements
### 8.2.1 Introduction
This section contains specific requirements for certain measurements beyond
those specified in section 8.1. The measurements are defined in TS 25.215, the
measurement model is defined in TS 25.302 and measurement accuracies are
specified in section 9. As long as the measurement configuration does not
exceed the requirements stated in section 8.2.2, the UE shall meet the
performance requirements defined in section 9.
Control of measurement reporting is specified in TS 25.331. Compressed mode is
specified in TS 25.215.
### 8.2.2 Requirements
The UE shall be able to perform in parallel all physical layer measurements
according to table 8.9. In this section one physical layer measurement
corresponds to a measurement at the reference point B (i.e. measurement
reported by layer 1 after layer 1 filtering) in the measurement model in TS
25.302 [15].
In addition to the requirements in table 8.9 the UE shall in parallel, in
state CELL_DCH, also be able to measure and report the quantities according to
section 8.1.

Editors Note: The presence of the measurements for location services needs to
be revised.
## 8.3 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria in
CELL_DCH state
### 8.3.1 Introduction
This section contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of event
triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement configuration
does not exceed the requirements stated in section 8.3.2, the UE shall meet
the performance requirements defined in section 9.
The UE can be requested to make measurements under different Measurement
Identities [16]. Each Measurement Identity corresponds to either event based
reporting, periodic reporting or no reporting. In case of event based
reporting, each Measurement Identity is associated with one or more events,
each identified with an Event Identity. In case of periodic reporting, a
Measurement Identity is associated with one periodic reporting criterion. In
case of no reporting, a Measurement Identity is associated with one no
reporting criterion.
The purpose of this section is to set some limits on the number of different
event, periodic and no reporting criteria the UE may be requested to track in
parallel.
### 8.3.2 Requirements
In this section a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event (in the
case of event based reporting), or one periodic reporting criterion (in case
of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion (in case of no
reporting). For event based reporting, each instance of event, with the same
or different Event Identities, is counted as separate reporting criterion in
Table 8.10.
The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to Table 8.10. If the UE is configured with a
single uplink carrier frequency, for the measurement categories: Intra-
frequency, Inter frequency, Inter frequency (virtual active set), and Inter-
RAT the UE need not support more than 42 reporting criteria in total. If the
UE is configured with dual uplink carrier frequencies, for the measurement
categories: Intra-frequency, Inter frequency, Inter frequency (virtual active
set), and Inter-RAT the UE need not support more than 55 reporting criteria in
total. For the measurement categories: Traffic volume and Quality measurements
the UE need not support more than 16 reporting criteria in total.
Table 8.10: Requirements for reporting criteria per measurement category
* * *
Measurement category E~cat~ Note Intra-frequency 16  
Inter-frequency 16  
Inter-frequency, virtual active set 4  
Inter-RAT GERAN 4 Only applicable for UE with this capability Inter-RAT

measurements 8  
Traffic volume measurements 2 + (2 per Transport Channel)  
Quality measurements 2 per Transport Channel  
UP measurements 2 Only applicable for UE with this capability. UE Rx-Tx time

Note: When the UE is configured with dual uplink carrier frequencies, E~cat~
for Intra-frequency is applied per intra-frequency.

## 8.4 Measurements in CELL_FACH State when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is
not ongoing
### 8.4.1 Introduction
This section contains requirements on the UE regarding cell reselection and
measurement reporting in CELL_FACH state when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception
is not ongoing. The requirements for cell re-selection are split in FDD intra
frequency, FDD inter frequency, TDD, GSM and E-UTRAN measurements. The
measurements are defined in TS 25.215, the measurement model is defined in TS
25.302 and measurement accuracies are specified in section 9. Control of
measurement reporting is specified in TS 25.331. Measurement occasions in
CELL_FACH state are described in TS 25.331.
If UE indicates support for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or increased
carrier monitoring E-UTRA the measurement performance for different carriers
may be configured by higher layers to be either normal or reduced. A
measurement scaling factor [16] defining the relaxation to be applied to the
requirements for carriers measured with reduced measurement performance is
signalled by higher layers and has the possible settings shown in table 8.0a.
The same measurement scaling factor mapping is used in Cell FACH state as cell
DCH state.
The minimum performance requirements for a UE which indicates support for
Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA [16, 31] are calculated as defined in
section 8.4.2.3 provided that N~freq,\ FDD,n~ ≤2 or if all FDD interfrequency
carriers are indicated to have normal performance. The minimum performance
requirements for a UE which indicates support for Increased UE carrier
monitoring E-UTRA [16, 31] are calculated as defined in section 8.4.2.6
provided that N~E-UTRA,n~≤4 _for a UE capable of either FDD E-UTRA carrier
monitoring or TDD E-UTRA carrier_ monitoring or N~freq,E-UTRA,n~≤8 _for a UE
capable of both FDD and TDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring provided_
N~freq,E-UTRA,n,FDD~≤4 _and_ N~freq,E-UTRA,n,TDD~≤4 or if all E-UTRA carriers
are indicated to have normal performance.
Capabilities for number of carriers to monitor for UE which indicates support
for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or E-UTRA are specified in section
8.4.2.1a.
### 8.4.2 Requirements
#### 8.4.2.1 UE Measurement Capability when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is
not ongoing
In CELL_FACH state, the UE shall be able to monitor up to
\- 32 intra frequency FDD cells and
\- 32 inter frequency cells, including
> \- FDD cells distributed on up to 2 additional FDD carriers and
>
> \- Depending on UE Capability, TDD mode cells, distributed on up to 3 TDD
> carriers, and
\- Depending on UE capability, 32 GSM cells distributed on up to 32 GSM
carriers, and
\- Depending on UE capability, up to 4 E-UTRA FDD carriers, and
\- Depending on UE capability up to 4 E-UTRA TDD carriers, and
\- Depending on UE capability, the UE shall be able to monitor up to 16 intra
frequency cells during IPDL gaps.
The requirements in section 9 on CPICH Ec/Io and RSCP measurements are
applicable for a UE performing measurements according to this section. For
inter-frequency FDD, TDD, GSM and E-UTRAN cell re-selection, measurement
occasions as specified in TS 25.331 are used to find and measure on other
cells.
It is defined below how the measurements on different systems and modes are
performed given the time allocated to that system. The requirements in this
section are based on an assumption that the time during the measurement
occasions that is allocated to each of the different modes and systems shall
be equally shared by the modes which the UE has capability for and that are in
the monitored set signalled by the network.
For this four parameters are defined:
_N~FDD~_ is 0 or 1. If there are inter-frequency FDD cells in the neighbour
list and FDD measurements are required by higher layers, _N~FDD~=_ 1,
otherwise _N~FDD~=_ 0.
_N~TDD~_ is 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of TDD and there are TDD cells in the
neighbour list and TDD measurements are required by higher layers, _N~TDD~=1_
otherwise _N~TDD ~_ =0.
_N~GSM~_ is 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of GSM and there are GSM cells in the
neighbour list and GSM measurements are required by higher layers, _N~GSM~=1,_
otherwise _N~GSM\ ~_ =0.
_N~E-UTRAN~_ is 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of E-UTRAN and there are E-UTRAN
cells in the neighbour list and E-UTRAN measurements are required by higher
layers, _N~E-UTRAN~_ =1, otherwise _N~E-UTRAN~_ =0.
The measurement time T~meas~ is then defined as
$T_{\text{meas}} = \left\lbrack \left( N_{\text{FDD}} + N_{\text{TDD}} +
N_{\text{GSM}} + \ N_{E - \text{UTRAN}} \right) \cdot N_{\text{TTI}} \cdot
\text{M_REP} \cdot \text{10} \right\rbrack$ms
where
\- M_REP is the Measurement Occasion cycle length where K is given in Table
8.10A. K is the FACH measurement occasion length coefficient as specified in
TS25.331
\- The FACH Measurement Occasion of N~TTI~ frames will be repeated every
N~TTI~ * M_REP frame.
\- N~TTI~ is the number of frames in each measurement occasion, equal to the
length of the largest TTI on the SCCPCH monitored by the UE. _FACHs that only
carry MBMS logical channels (MTCH, MSCH, or MCCH) are excluded from
measurement occasion calculations._
_\- A UE receiving MTCH shall use only that part of the Measurement Occasion
of NTTI frames which corresponds to 25% of the MTCH TTI length at the
maximum._
_For UEs receiving MTCH, the reduced measurement time, if applicable, needs to
be considered when performance requirements are derived according to section
8. The repetition rate of NTTI * M_REP frames remains unaffected_
Table 8.10A: K values for each N~TTI~ value
* * *
N~TTI~ K 1 3,4,5,6 2 2,3,4,5 4 2,3,4 8 1,2,3
* * *
The UE is assumed to measure periodically once every time period T~meas~ on
each of the modes and systems, FDD inter frequency cells, TDD inter frequency
cells, GSM and E-UTRA carriers for which the corresponding parameter N~FDD~,
N~TDD~, N~GSM~ and N~E-UTRAN~ is set to 1.
#### 8.4.2.1a UE Measurement Capability when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception
is not ongoing (Increased UE carrier monitoring)
UE which indicates support for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA according
to capabilities in [16,31] shall additionally be capable of monitoring at
least
80 inter-frequency cells, including
\- 5 FDD UTRA inter-frequency carriers with up to 32 cells per carrier.
UE which indicates support for increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA
according to capabilities in [16,31] shall be capable of monitoring at least
\- Depending on UE capability, 8 FDD E-UTRA carriers, and
\- Depending on UE capability, 8 TDD E-UTRA carriers
#### 8.4.2.2 FDD intra frequency measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous
reception is not ongoing
####
During the CELL_FACH state the UE shall continuously measure identified intra
frequency cells and search for new intra frequency cells in the monitoring
set. If a measurement occasion is activated, intra frequency measurements can
be performed between the measurement occasions.
The performance of intra frequency measurements when IPDL is active has not
been studied.
##### 8.4.2.2.1 Identification of a new cell
The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable cell belonging to the
monitored set within
$T_{\text{identify},\text{\ intra}} = \text{Max}\left{ \text{800,Ceil\ }\left{

\cdot \left( \text{M_REP-1} \right) \cdot \text{10}} \right} \cdot
N_{\text{TTI}} \cdot \text{M_REP} \cdot \text{10} \right}$ms
where
T~basic_identify_FDD,\ intra~ is specified in section 8.1.2.2.2,
N~TTI~ and M_REP is specified in section 8.4.2.1.
A cell shall be considered detectable when
\- CPICH Ec/Io [>]{.underline} -20 dB,
\- SCH_Ec/Io [>]{.underline} -20 dB for at least one channel tap and
SCH_Ec/Ior is equally divided between primary synchronisation code and
secondary synchronisation code.
In the case that MTCH is being received, the UE shall be able to take
identified cells into use for MTCH combining purposes within one MTCH TTI
after the completion of identification.
If more candidate cells are identified than the UE has combining capability,
then the UE shall estimate MTCH reception quality of all candidate cells and
determine a subset of the identified cells which best allow the UE to meet the
required MTCH reception performance.
In case of conflict when a measurement occasion is activated the UE may choose
to prioritise the SFN decoding
###### 8.4.2.2.1.1 Identification of a new cell using IPDL gaps
When the UE is supporting IPDL measurements and when idle periods with a
length of 1 slot are scheduled the UE physical layer shall be capable to

CPICH measurements defined in Section 8.1.2.2.2.
and

* * *
Search Window Size T~IPDL~ less than or equal to +/- 40 chips Time over which
4 consecutive IPDL gaps occur +/- 80 chips Time over which 8 consecutive IPDL
gaps occur

cells of the monitored set and the UE physical layer shall be capable of
reporting measurements to higher layers with the measurement period of 200 ms.
When a measurement occasion cycle is activated, the UE shall be capable of
performing CPICH measurements for the Y~measurement\ intra~ strongest cells ,
where Y~measurement\ intra~ is defined in the following equation. The
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in the sub-
clause 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. If the UE has identified more than Y~measurement\
intra~ cells, the UE shall perform measurements of all identified cells but
the reporting rate of CPICH measurements of cells from UE physical layer to
higher layers may be decreased.
$Y_{\text{measurement}\ \text{\ intra}} = \text{Floor}\left{ X_{\text{basic}\
\text{measurement}\ \text{FDD}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement_Period\
Intra}} - \text{Ceil}\left{ \frac{T_{\text{Measurement_Period\

the requirements in section 9.
#### 8.4.2.3 FDD inter frequency measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous

####
In the CELL_FACH state when a measurement occasion cycle is provided by the
network, and absolute priority based reselection is not used, the UE shall
continuously measure identified inter frequency cells and search for new inter
frequency cells indicated in the measurement control information. When
absolute priority based reselection is used, measurement rules defined in [1]
apply (based on S~prioritysearch1~ and S~prioritysearch2~ thresholds).
If E-DCH resources are allocated to the UE or timer T321[16] is running, the
UE is not required to perform interfrequency FDD cell identification or
measurement.

#### 8.4.2.5 GSM measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is not
ongoing
The requirements in this section apply only to UE supporting FDD and GSM. If
E-DCH resources are allocated to the UE or timer T321[16] is running, the UE
is not required to perform GSM BSIC identification or RSSI measurement.
To support cell reselection the UE shall always perform BSIC verification in
Cell FACH state.
1) In CELL_FACH state when measurement occasions are provided by the UTRAN the
UE shall continuously measure GSM cells and search for new GSM cells given in
the monitored set.
In section 8.4.2.1 the split of measurements between different modes and
systems is defined. Every second measurement occasion scheduled for GSM
measurements, as given by 8.4.2.1 shall be allocated for GSM initial BSIC
identification.
The remaining measurements occasions scheduled for GSM measurements shall be
used as follows. 3 occasions out of 4 shall be allocated for GSM carrier RSSI
measurements and 1 out of 4 shall be allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation.
The scheduling of measurement occasions between GSM carrier RSSI measurements
and GSM BSIC reconfirmation is up to the UE.
2) If the UE does not need measurement occasions to perform GSM measurements:
\- the UE shall measure all GSM cells present in the monitored set
\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel is
assigned in TS 45.008 shall apply. This is further detailed in the following
sub-sections.
##### 8.4.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI
1) For a UE requiring measurement occasions.
A UE supporting GSM measurements using measurement occasions shall meet the
minimum number of GSM carrier RSSI measurements specified in Table 8.11. This
measurement shall be based on measurement occasions allocated for GSM carrier
RSSI measurements as described in 8.4.2.5. In the CELL_FACH state the
measurement period for the GSM carrier RSSI measurement is 480 ms.
The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV in TS
45.008, when the given measurement time allows the UE to take at least 3 GSM
carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set during the
measurement period.
Table 8.11
* * *
Length of measurement occasion (frames) Number of GSM carrier RSSI samples in
each measurement occasion, N~GSM\ carrier\ RSSI~. 1 16 2 32 4 64 8 128
* * *
In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per GSM
carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many GSM
carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3 samples
per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during that
measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement periods.
2) For a UE not requiring measurement occasions
The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly
distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received signal level
measurement samples are required per RSSI value. The measurement period is 480
ms.
In case UTRA RACH procedure prevents the UE from acquiring the required number
of samples per GSM carrier during one measurement period, the GSM carriers
that were not measured during that measurement period shall be measured in the
following measurement periods.
##### 8.4.2.5.2 BSIC verification
1) For a UE requiring measurement occasions.
The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into the
following two tasks:
Initial BSIC identification\ Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding the
BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about the relative timing
between the FDD and GSM cell. The UE shall trigger the initial BSIC
identification within 50% of the available measurement occasions used for GSM
measurements as specified in 8.4.2.1. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in 8.4.2.5.2.1.
BSIC re-confirmation\ Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after
initial BSIC identification is performed. The UE shall trigger the BSIC re-
confirmation within the available measurement occasions used for GSM as
specified in 8.4.2.1. The requirements for BSIC re-confirmation can be found
in 8.4.2.5.2.2.
The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has decoded
the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one time (initial
BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall be re-confirmed at
least once every 6 times T~re-confirm_GSM~ seconds. Otherwise the BSIC of the
GSM cell is considered as \"non-verified\".
T~re-confirm_GSM~ indicates the maximum time allowed for the re-confirmation
of the BSIC of one GSM cell in the BSIC re-confirmation procedure according to
section 8.4.2.5.2.2.
The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC within a measurement occasion when the
time difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation burst
at the UE and the middle of the measurement occasion is within the limits
specified in table 8.12.
Table 8.12: The measurement occasion length and maximum time difference for
BSIC verification
+---------------------------------------+-------------------------+ | Measurement occasion length (frames] | Maximum time difference | | | | | | [μs] | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------+ | 1 | ± 4100 | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------+ | 2 | ± 9100 | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------+ | 4 | ± 19100 | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------+ | 8 | ± 39100 | +---------------------------------------+-------------------------+
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
TS 45.005.
2) For a UE not requiring measurement occasions
The UE shall attempt to check the BSIC for at least the 6 strongest GSM
carriers at least every 10 seconds, to confirm that it is monitoring the same
cell, as far as UTRA RACH procedure does not prevent UE from decoding BSIC.
If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, it is considered as
\"verified\", else it is considered as \"non verified\".
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
TS 45.005.
###### 8.4.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification
This measurement shall be based on the measurement occasions allocated for
Initial BSIC identification as described in 8.4.2.5.
The UE shall continuously attempt to decode the BSIC of SCH on the BCCH
carrier of the 6 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM cells indicated in the
Inter-RAT cell info list. The UE shall give priority for BSIC decoding
attempts in decreasing signal strength order to BCCH carriers with unknown
BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier having the
highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value.
When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with unknown
BSIC, the UE shall use all available measurements occasions allocated for GSM
initial BSIC identification according section 8.4.2.5 to attempt to decode the
BSIC from that GSM BCCH carrier.
If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE shall
immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH carrier, in
signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has
been successfully identified shall be moved to the BSIC re-confirmation
procedure.
If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier within
T~identify,\ GSM~ ms, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification attempts for
that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform BSIC
identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The GSM
BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification failed shall not be re-
considered for BSIC identification until BSIC identification attempts have
been made for all the rest of the 6 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the
monitored set with unknown BSIC.
T~identify_GSM~ is given for the combinations of T~meas~ and N~TTI~ that are
given in table 8.13. The values given in table 8.13 represent the number of
patterns required to guarantee at least two attempts to decode the BSIC for
one GSM BCCH carrier.

###### 8.4.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation
The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC re-confirmation.
The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC identification.
The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is decoded.
For each measurement occasion allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation as
described in 8.4.2.5, the UE shall attempt to decode the BSIC falling within
the measurement occasion duration according to table 8.12. When the UE has to
select one out of several possible GSM cells to reconfirm within the possible
allocation of measurement occasions, according to 8.4.2.5, priority shall be
given to the least recently decoded BSIC.
If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts the UE shall
abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM cell shall
be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the GSM cell shall be
moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure, see section 8.4.2.5.2.1.
The UE shall be able to make BSIC re-confirmation attempts for the 6 strongest
GSM cells in the monitored list.
T~re-confirm_GSM~ is given for the combinations of T~meas~ and N~TTI~ that are
given in table 8.14. The values given in table 8.14 represent the number of
patterns required to guarantee at least two attempts to decode the BSIC for
one GSM BCCH carrier. Different values for T~re-confirm\ GSM~ might apply when
more than one GSM cell is in the BSIC reconfirmation procedure at the same
time.

## 8.4a Measurements in CELL_FACH State when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception
is ongoing
### 8.4a.1 Introduction
This section contains requirements on the UE regarding cell reselection and
measurement reporting in CELL_FACH state when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception
is ongoing. The requirements for cell re-selection are split in FDD intra
frequency, FDD inter frequency, TDD, GSM and E-UTRA measurements. The
measurements are defined in TS 25.215, the measurement model is defined in TS
25.302 and measurement accuracies are specified in section 9. Control of
measurement reporting is specified in TS 25.331. DRX in CELL_FACH state is
described in TS 25.331.
If UE indicates support for increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or increased
carrier monitoring E-UTRA the measurement performance for different carriers
may be configured by higher layers to be either normal or reduced. A
measurement scaling factor [16] defining the relaxation to be applied to the
requirements for carriers measured with reduced measurement performance is
signalled by higher layers and has the possible settings shown in table 8.0a.
The same measurement scaling factor mapping is used in Cell FACH state as cell
DCH state.
The minimum performance requirements for a UE which indicates support for
Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA [16, 31] are calculated as defined in
section 8.4a.2.3 provided that N~freq,\ FDD,n~ ≤2 or if all FDD interfrequency
carriers are indicated to have normal performance. The minimum performance
requirements for a UE which indicates support for Increased UE carrier
monitoring E-UTRA [16, 31] are calculated as defined in section 8.4a.2.6
provided that N~E-UTRA,n~≤4 _for a UE capable of either FDD E-UTRA carrier
monitoring or TDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring_ or N~freq,E-UTRA,n~≤8 _for a UE
capable of both FDD and TDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring provided_
N~freq,E-UTRA,n,FDD~≤4 _and_ N~freq,E-UTRA,n,TDD~≤4 or if all E-UTRA carriers
are indicated to have normal performance.
Capabilities for number of carriers to monitor for UE which indicates support
for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or E-UTRA are specified in section
8.4.2.1a.
### 8.4a.2 Requirements
#### 8.4a.2.1 UE Measurement Capability
In CELL_FACH state, the number of cells the UE shall be able to monitor is
defined in section 8.4.2.1 and 8.4.2.1a.
The requirements in section 9 on CPICH Ec/Io and RSCP measurements are
applicable for a UE performing measurements according to this section. For
inter-frequency FDD, TDD, GSM and E-UTRAN cell re-selection, DRX gaps as
specified in TS 25.331 are used to find and measure on other cells.
It is defined below how the measurements on different systems and modes are
performed given the time allocated to that system. The requirements in this
section are based on an assumption that the time during the DRX gaps that is
allocated to each of the different modes and systems shall be equally shared
by the modes which the UE has capability for and that are in the monitored set
signalled by the network.

X~basic\ measurement\ TDD\ inter~ is defined in section 8.1.2.4.2
#### 8.4a.2.5 GSM measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is ongoing
The requirements in this section apply only to UE supporting FDD and GSM. If
E-DCH resources are allocated to the UE or timer T321[16] is running, the UE
is not required to perform GSM BSIC identification or RSSI measurement.
To support cell reselection the UE shall always perform BSIC verification in
Cell FACH state.
##### 8.4a.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI
A UE supporting GSM measurements shall be able to measure at least 32 GSM
cells and shall be able to obtain RSSI samples of these cells during a DRX off
period. In the CELL_FACH state the measurement period for the GSM carrier RSSI
measurement is
T~measurement_period,GSM~=min(30720,max(480ms,T~scale~*T~DRX~_~CYCLE~*6)).
The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV in TS
45.008, when the given measurement time allows the UE to take at least 3 GSM
carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set during the
measurement period.
In case UTRA RACH procedure prevents the UE from acquiring the required number
of samples per GSM carrier during one measurement period, the GSM carriers
that were not measured during that measurement period shall be measured in the
following measurement periods.
##### 8.4a.2.5.2 BSIC verification
The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into the
following two tasks:
Initial BSIC identification\ Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding the
BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about the relative timing
between the FDD and GSM cell. The requirements for Initial BSIC identification
can be found in 8.4a.2.5.2.1.
BSIC re-confirmation\ Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after
initial BSIC identification is performed. The requirements for BSIC re-
confirmation can be found in 8.4s.2.5.2.2.
The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has decoded
the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one time (initial
BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall be re-confirmed at
least once every 30 seconds. Otherwise the BSIC of the GSM cell is considered
as \"non-verified\".
The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC within a measurement occasion when the
time difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation burst
at the UE and the middle of the measurement occasion is within TBD.
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
TS 45.005.
###### 8.4a.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification
The UE shall continuously attempt to decode the BSIC of SCH on the BCCH
carrier of the 6 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM cells indicated in the
Inter-RAT cell info list. The UE shall give priority for BSIC decoding
attempts in decreasing signal strength order to BCCH carriers with unknown
BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier having the
highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value.
If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE shall
immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH carrier, in
signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has
been successfully identified shall be moved to the BSIC re-confirmation
procedure.
The UE is required to decode the BSIC within T~identify_GSM,DRX~ =500ms for
all DRX cycles. This value guarantees at least two attempts to decode the BSIC
for one GSM BCCH carrier.
If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier within
T~identify_GSM,DRX~ =500 ms, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification
attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform
BSIC identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The
GSM BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification failed shall not be re-
considered for BSIC identification until BSIC identification attempts have
been made for all the rest of the 6 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the
monitored set with unknown BSIC. Additionally, the UE is not required to
attempt to decode the BSIC of a GSM carrier for a period of 30 seconds after
an unsuccessful decoding attempt has been made on that GSM carrier.
###### 8.4a.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation
The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC re-confirmation.
The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC identification.
The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is decoded.
If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts the UE shall
abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM cell shall
be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the GSM cell shall be
moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure, see section 8.4a.2.5.2.1.
The UE shall be able to make BSIC re-confirmation attempts for the 6 strongest
GSM cells in the monitored list.
The UE shall perform BSIC re-confirmation at least every T~re-confirm_GSM,DRX~
=30 seconds.
#### 8.4a.2.6 E-UTRA measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is
ongoing
In the CELL_FACH state when DRX is being performed by the UE, the UE shall
measure identified E-UTRAN cells and search for new E-UTRAN cells indicated in
the measurement control information, according to the measurement rules
defined in [1].
When absolute priority based reselection is used:
\- If Srxlev~ServingCell~ > S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~ >
S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for E-UTRA layers of higher
priority at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2.

report measurements in measurement reports, whose report criteria can be set
to Event triggered or Periodical reporting. In both cases, the UE shall send
only one measurement report. The UE shall be able to support at least 1 E-UTRA
measurement per carrier on up to 4 E-UTRA carriers for CELL_FACH
configuration.
Reported measurements shall meet the requirements in section 9.
##### 8.4a.2.6.3.1 Event Triggered reporting {#a.2.6.3.1-event-triggered-
reporting .H6}
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between the triggering
of a measurement report (the measured quality of any cell on a configured
E-UTRA frequency exceeds the configured threshold) until the moment in time
when the UE starts sending the preambles on the PRACH for sending the
measurement report
The event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than T
~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ + T~RA~, where T ~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ is defined in
Section 8.4.2.6.1 and T~RA~ is the additional delay caused by the random
access procedure.
If a cell has been detectable at least for the time period than T ~identify\
,E-UTRAN~ and then triggers the measurement report, the event triggered
measurement reporting delay shall be less than T~Measurement_Period_E-UTRAN~ +
T~RA~ provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while
transmission gap has not been available.

# 9 Measurements Performance Requirements
One of the key services provided by the physical layer is the measurement of
various quantities which are used to trigger or perform a multitude of
functions. Both the UE and the UTRAN are required to perform a variety of
measurements. The physical layer measurement model and a complete list of
measurements is specified in TS 25.302 \"Services Provided by Physical
Layer\". The physical layer measurements for FDD are described and defined in
TS25.215 \"Physical layer ‑ Measurements (FDD)\". In this clause for each
measurement the relevant requirements on the measurement period, reporting
range, granularity and performance in terms of accuracy are specified.
Since the UE reference sensitivity requirements are different depending on
supported band, this is noted in each case with definition of the range Io for
each frequency band. Definitions of each frequency bands can be found in TS
25.101.
The accuracy requirements in this clause are applicable for AWGN radio
propagation conditions.
## 9.1 Measurement Performance for UE
The requirements in this clause are applicable for a UE:
\- in state CELL_DCH and/or state CELL_FACH when DRX is not configured.
\- performing measurements according to section 8.
\- that is synchronised to the cell that is measured.
The reported measurement result after layer 1 filtering shall be an estimate
of the average value of the measured quantity over the measurement period. The
reference point for the measurement result after layer 1 filtering is referred
to as point B in the measurement model described in TS25.302.
The accuracy requirements in this clause are valid for the reported
measurement result after layer 1 filtering. The accuracy requirements are
verified from the measurement report at point D in the measurement model
having the layer 3 filtering disabled.
NOTE: It needs to be clarified how the accuracy requirements shall be handled
when the UE is measuring on cells using IPDL.
NOTE: For the UE which supports both Band III and Band IX operating
frequencies, the measurement performance requirements for Band III shall apply
to the multi-band UE.
When DRX is configured in state CELL_FACH, the accuracy specified for idle
mode reselections in chapter 4 is applicable to UE measurements.
NOTE: The requirements for Band XXXII are applicable only with dual band
configuration (e.g., DB-DC-HSDPA or dual band 4C-HSDPA).
### 9.1.1 CPICH RSCP
NOTE: This measurement is for handover evaluation, DL open loop power control,
UL open loop power control and for the calculation of pathloss.
#### 9.1.1.1 Intra frequency measurements accuracy
The measurement period for CELL_DCH state can be found in sub clause 8.1.2.2.
The measurement period for CELL_FACH state can be found in sub clause 8.4.2.2.
##### 9.1.1.1.1 Absolute accuracy requirement
The accuracy requirements in table 9.1 are valid under the following
conditions:
CPICH_RSCP1\|~dBm~.according to Annex B.3.1 for a corresponding Band
$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\ -

#### A.4.5.2.2 Test Requirements
The cell reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to
perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 21 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateEUTRA~ \+
T~SI-EUTRA~, where:
T~evaluateEUTRA~ See Table 4.2 in section 4.2.2.
T~SI-EUTRA~ Maximum time allowed to read system information from a E-UTRA cell
[24].\ According to [24], the maximum time allowed to read relevant system
info blocks, that need to be received by the UE to camp on a cell, is 1280 ms.
This gives a total of 20.48 s, allow 21 s in the test case.
### A.4.5.3 RSRQ based reselection when E-UTRA FDD is of higher priority
#### A.4.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA FDD inter-
RAT cell reselection delay reported based on RSRQ measurement in section 4.2.
The test scenario comprises two different cells, with cell 1 being the UTRA
serving cell, cell 2 being the E-UTRA cell to be re-selected to. Test
parameters are given in Tables A.4.20, A.4.21, A.4.22. The test consists of
four successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3 and T4,
respectively. UTRA cell 1 is already identified by the UE prior to the start
of the test. Cell 2 is of higher priority than cell 1.
Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore, UE
has not registered with network for the tracking area containing cell 2.

#### A.4.5.3.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall not send preambles on the PRACH before the end of T2.
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to
perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2. The cell re-selection
delay shall be less than 21 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
T~higher_priority_search~ + T~evaluateEUTRA~ + T~SI~, where:
T~higher_priority_search~ See section 4.2.2, where, this value should be 0s,
since the cell2 shall be already indentified at the beginning of T3
T~evaluateEUTRA~ See Table 4.2 in section 4.2.2.5a
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 20.48 s, allow 21 s in the test case.
### A.4.5.4 E-UTRA FDD is of higher priority (Increased UE carrier monitoring)
#### A.4.5.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA FDD inter-
RAT cell reselection delay for the increased UE carrier monitoring case
reported in section 4.2.
The test scenario comprises four different cells, with cell 1 being the UTRA
serving cell and cell 2, cell 3 and cell 4 being the E-UTRA FDD cells to be
re-selected to. The UE is requested to monitor E-UTRA FDD neighbouring cells
on 8 carriers. Test parameters are given in Tables A.4.23, A.4.24, A.4.25,
A.4.26, A.4.27. The test consists of seven successive time periods, with time
duration of T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 respectively respectively. All cells
are identified by the UE during T0. Cell 2, cell 3 and cell 4 are of higher
priority than cell 1. Cells 2, 3 and 4 are chosen randomly, such that one
frequency belongs to the E-UTRA FDD normal performance group and two
frequencies belong to the E-UTRA FDD reduced performance group. The neighbour
lists of cells 2, 3 and 4 shall include the frequency of cell 1 (in the UTRA
FDD normal performance group) as well as the other frequencies configured to
the UE in the test.
Cell 1 and cells 2, 3 and 4 shall all belong to different location areas.
Furthermore, UE has not registered with network for the location area
containing cells 2, 3 and 4.

#### A.4.5.4.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of the
relevant time period, to the moment when the UE camps on the target cell, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on the target cell.
* * *
Time phase Target cell Requirement for reselection delay (seconds) T0 Cell 1  
T1 Cell 2 (E-UTRA FDD normal performance group) 78.1 T2 Cell 1 21 T3 Cell 3
(E-UTRA FDD reduced performance group) 462.1 T4 Cell 1 21 T5 Cell 4 (E-UTRA
FDD reduced performance group) 462.1
* * *
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%, with a successful reselection counted if it is within the
required time regardless of the carrier frequencies involved. At least 90% of
reselections to the reduced performance group shall be within the required
time and at least 90% of reselections to the normal performance group shall be
within the required time, with a successful reselection counted if it is
within the required time regardless of the carrier frequencies involved.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
K~norm,\ EUTRA~ * T~evaluateEUTRA~ + T~SI~, for E-UTRA FDD normal performance
group = 4*19.2 + 1.28 = 76.8 + 1.28 = 78.08s
K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ * 6 * T~evaluateEUTRA~ + T~SI~, for E-UTRA FDD reduced
performance group = 4*6*19.2 + 1.28 = 460.8 + 1.28 = 462.08s
where:
K~norm,\ EUTRA~ See section 4.2.2
K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ See section 4.2.2
T~higher_priority_search~ See section 4.2.2
T~evaluateEUTRA~ See Table 4.2 in section 4.2.2.5a
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of:
78.08 s when K~norm,\ EUTRA~=4 for reselections to E-UTRA FDD normal
performance group, allow 78.1s in the test case.
462.08 s when K~reduced,\ EUTRA~=4 for reselections to E-UTRA FDD reduced
performance group, allow 462.1s in the test case.
## A.4.5A UTRAN to E-UTRA TDD Cell Reselection with Increased Carrier
Monitoring
### A.4.5A.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA TDD inter-
RAT cell reselection delay for increased carrier monitoring case reported in
section 4.2. 3 **cells on 3 different carriers are configured on test
equipment with Cell 1 being the serving cell and Cells 2 and 3 being the
neighbour EUTRA cells** such that Cell 2 belongs to the normal performance
group and Cell 3 belongs to the reduced performance group**.** The UE is
requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 8 carriers. **E-UTRA cells are of
higher priority than UTRA.**
The test scenario comprises three different cells, with cell 1 being the UTRA
serving cell and cell 2 and 3 being the E-UTRA cells to be re-selected to.
Test parameters are given in Tables A.4.14A, A.4.15A, A.4.16A, A.4.17A,. The
test consists of five successive time periods, with time durations T0, T1, T2,
T3 and T4, respectively.
Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore,

#### A.4.5A.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of a
relevant time period, to the moment when the UE camps on the target cell, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on the target Cell.
* * *
Time phase Target cell Requirement for reselection delay (seconds) T1 Cell 2
(normal performance group) 78.08 T3 Cell 3 (reduced performance group) 462.08
* * *
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90% with a successful reselection counted if it is within the
required time regardless of the carrier frequencies involved. At least 90% of
reselections to the reduced performance group shall be within the required
time, and at least 90% of reselections to the normal performance group shall
be within the required time, with a successful reselection counted if it is
within the required time regardless of the carrier frequencies involved.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: K~norm,\ EUTRA~ *
T~evaluateEUTRA~ + T~SI~ for normal performance group and K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ *
T~evaluateE-UTRA~ + T~SI~ for reduced performance group where:
> T~evaluateEUTRA~ See Table 4.2 in section 4.2.2.5a
>
> K~norm,\ EUTRA~ Number of E-UTRA carriers in the normal performance group
>
> K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ Number of E-UTRA carriers in the reduced performance
> group
>
> T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
> be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in this test
> case.
This gives a total of
78.08s when K~norm,\ EUTRA~ =4 for reselections to normal performance group,
allow 78.1s in the test case.
462.08s when K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ =4 for reselections to reduced performance
group, allow 462.1s in the test case.

#### A.5.4.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall begin to send access bursts on the new DCCH of the target cell
less than 100 ms from the beginning of time period T3.
The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The test requirement in this test case is expressed as:
T~Handover\ delay~ = 90 ms (Table 5.2) + T~offset~ + T~UL~
T~offset~ : Equal to 4.65 ms, GSM timing uncertainty between the time from
when the UE is ready to transmit until the start of the next timeslot in GSM
26 multiframe structure
T~UL~: Equal to 4.65 ms, the time the UE has to wait in case the next timeslot
is an idle frame or a SACCH frame.
This gives a total of 99.3 ms, allow 100 ms in the test case.
#### A.5.4a Inter-system Handover from UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN FDD
#### A.5.4a.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN FDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.4a.
The test parameters are given in Table A.5.0G, A.5.0H and A.5.0I below. In the
measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that event-triggered
reporting with Event 3A shall be used. The test consists of three successive
time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start
of time duration T1, the UE does not have any timing information of Cell 2.
Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes detectable and the UE is expected to detect and
send a measurement report.
The UTRAN shall send a Handover from UTRAN command with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. In the E-UTRAN Handover command
contained in that message, the IE starting time shall not be included. The RRC
HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE. The start of T3
is defined as the end of last TTI containing the HO command.
The requirements are also applicable for a UE not requiring compressed mode,
in which case no compressed mode pattern should be sent for the parameters
specified in table A.5.0G.

## A.5.4d Inter-system Handover from UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD; Unknown Target
Cell
### A.5.4d.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD
handover requirements for the case when the target E-UTRAN FDD cell is unknown
as specified in section 5.4b.
The test parameters are given in Table A.5.0P, A.5.0Q and A.5.0R below. The
test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of T1 and T2
respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any
timing information of Cell 2. No compressed mode patterns are configured in
the test case.
The UTRAN shall send a Handover from UTRAN command with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. In the E-UTRAN Handover command
contained in that message, the IE starting time shall not be included. The RRC
HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE towards the end of
the time period T1. The start of T2 is defined as the end of last TTI
containing the handover command.

#### A.5.5.1.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the the CELL UPDATE message with cause
value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.6 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ intra}} = T_{\text{Measurement_Period\ Intra}}
+ T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ms,
where:
T~Measurement_Period\ Intra~ is specified in 8.4.2.2.2 as 200 ms in this case.
T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell.1280 ms is
assumed in this test case.
NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC procedure
delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms
T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be 1 in
this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.
This gives a total of 1.55 s, allow 1.6 s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.1A.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the the CELL UPDATE message with cause
value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 3 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ intra}} = T_{\text{Measurement_Period\ Intra}}
+ T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ms,
where:
T~Measurement_Period\ Intra~ is specified in 8.4A.2.2.2 as 1600 ms in this
case.
T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell.1280 ms is
assumed in this test case.
NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC procedure
delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms
T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be 1 in
this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.
This gives a total of 2.95 s, allow 3 s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.2.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the the CELL UPDATE message with cause
value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.9 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{Measurement\ inter}} +
T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ ms,
where:
T~measurement\ inter~is specified in 8.4.2.3.2 as 480 ms in this case.
T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell.1280 ms is
assumed in this test case.
NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC procedure
delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms.
T~RA~: T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be 1 in
this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.
This gives a total of 1.83 s, allow 1.9 s in the test case.
### A.5.5.2A Two frequencies present in the neighbour list and HS-DSCH DRX

#### A.5.5.2A.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-
selection delay in CELL_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.2.
This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
tables A.5.4AA and A.5.4AB. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells
on 2 carriers. The maximum repetition period of the relevant system info
blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.
Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas.

#### A.5.5.2C.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to
perform a Location Registration on cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 12 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{Measurement,\ inter}} +
T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,
where:
T~measurement,inter~ See section 8.4a.2.3.2; as 10240 ms in this case
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
T~IU~ 10msec
T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be 1 in
this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.
This gives a total of 11.6 s, allow 12s in the test case.
### A.5.5.2D Two frequencies present in the neighbour list and HS-DSCH 2^nd^
DRX configured (Absolute priority levels configured)
#### A.5.5.2D.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-
selection delay in CELL_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.2.
This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
tables A.5.4AG and A.5.4AH. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells
on 2 carriers. The maximum repetition period of the relevant system info
blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.
Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas. The target UTRA
carrier (cell 1) shall have higher absolute priority than the starting carrier
(cell 2).

### A.5.5.2E Five frequencies present in the neighbour list and FACH
measurement occasions configured for Increased Carrier Monitoring
#### A.5.5.2E.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-
selection delay in CELL_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.2.
The test parameters are given in tables A5.4AI, A5.4AJ, A5.4AK and A5.4AL. The
UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 5 carriers. Each repetition
of the test consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of
T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively. In the initialisation phase and at the
start of each repetition of T0, the test equipment provides signals for cell 1
(serving cell), and selects frequencies for cells 2, 3 and 4 which are chosen
from the 5 inter-frequency layers which are configured in the UE neighbour
cell list as described in general and cell specific parameters. The neighbour
lists of cells 2, 3 and 4 shall include the frequency of cell 1 in the normal
performance group as well as the other frequencies configured to the UE in the
test. The maximum repetition period of the relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

#### A.5.5.2E.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of a
relevant time period, to the moment when the UE camps on the target cell, and
starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the the CELL UPDATE message
with cause value \"cell reselection\" on the target Cell.
This gives a total of

Cell 4 (reduced performance group) 12.9s T4 Cell 1 (normal performance group)
2.5s
* * *
The rate of correct cell reselections to the normal performance group observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90% and the rate of correct cell
reselections to the reduced performance group observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%, with a successful reselection counted if it is within
the required time regardless of the carrier frequencies involved.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{Measurement\ inter}} +
T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ ms,
where:
T~measurement\ inter~is specified in 8.4.2.3.2 as xxx ms in this case.
T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell.1280 ms is
assumed in this test case.
NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC procedure
delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms.
T~RA~: T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be 1 in
this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

#### A.5.5.4.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the CELL UPDATE message with cause value
\"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.9s.
During T1 and T2 the MTCH SDU ER shall not exceed 4.0%.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{Measuremnt,\ inter}} +
T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ ms,
where:
T~Measuremnt,\ inter~ Specified in 8.4.2.3.2 as 480ms
T~identify,\ inter~i Specified in 8.4.2.3.1 as 2.72 s in this case, thus 3sec
for T2 is sufficient for identification of cell 1.
Note: The calculation based on the S-CCPCH carrying the FACH provides a
measurement occasion of 20ms repeated every 80ms. As the MTCH TTI length is
only 40ms this has to be shortened to a gap of 10ms every 80ms, the re-
selection delay is based upon.
T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell.1280 ms is
assumed in this test case.
Note: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC procedure
delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms.
T~RA~: T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be 1 in
this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.
Note: The maximum allowed time to be used to perform the measurements for a UE
in an MBMS session may be smaller than the duration of the measurement
occasion to fulfill the MBMS demodulation performance.
This gives a total of 1.83 s, allow 1,9s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.5.1 Reselection to E-UTRA FDD when HS-DSCH DRX is configured
(E-UTRA has higher priority)
##### A.5.5.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA FDD inter-
RAT cell reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5
The test scenario comprises two different cells, with cell 1 being the UTRA
serving cell and cell 2 being the E-UTRA cell to be re-selected to. Test
parameters are given in Tables A.5.4L, A.5.4M, A.5.4N. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2. UTRA cell 1 is
already identified by the UE prior to the start of the test. Cell 2 is of
higher priority than cell 1.
Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore, UE
has not registered with network for the tracking area containing cell 2.
CELL_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception should be configured. The UE
should not be scheduled with HS-DSCH data during T1 and T2 such that the DRX
cycle becomes active

##### A.5.5.5.1.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to
perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 66 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{HigherPrioritySearch}} +
\text{40} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$, where:
T~SI~ = the maximum time allowed aquire system information from a E-UTRAN
cell, 1280msec [24].
T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure, 30msec
[24]
T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in section
8.4a.2.6.1
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2
This gives a total of 67.7, allow 66 s in the test case.
#### A.5.5.5.2 Reselection to E-UTRA FDD when HS-DSCH DRX is configured
(E-UTRA has lower priority)
##### A.5.5.5 2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to E-UTRAN cell
reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5.
This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1 E-UTRAN cell
to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1
UTRAN carrier and 1 E-UTRAN carrier. Test parameters are given in Table,
A.5.4O, A.5.4P, A.5.4Q. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1 and T2, respectively. Both UTRA cell 1 and E-UTRA cell 2
are already identified by the UE prior to the start of the test. Cell 2 is of
lower priority than cell 1. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different
tracking areas.
CELL_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception and with only the first DRX
cycle active should be configured. The UE should not be scheduled with HS-DSCH
data during T1 and T2 such that the DRX cycle becomes active.

T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,
where:
T~SI~ = the maximum time allowed aquire system information from a E-UTRAN
cell, 1280msec [24].
T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure, 30msec
[24]
T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in section
8.4a.2.6.1
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2
This gives a total of 65.67, allow 66 s in the test case.
#### A.5.5.5.4 Reselection to E-UTRA TDD when HS-DSCH DRX is configured
(E-UTRA has higher priority)
##### A.5.5.5.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA TDD inter-
RAT cell reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5
The test scenario comprises two different cells, with cell 1 being the UTRA
serving cell and cell 2 being the E-UTRA cell to be re-selected to. Test
parameters are given in Tables A.5.4U, A.5.4V, A.5.4W. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2. UTRA cell 1 is
already identified by the UE prior to the start of the test. Cell 2 is of
higher priority than cell 1.
Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore, UE
has not registered with network for the tracking area containing cell 2.
CELL_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception should be configured. The UE
should not be scheduled with HS-DSCH data during T1 and T2 such that the DRX
cycle becomes active.

##### A.5.5.5.4.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to
perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 66 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{HigherPrioritySeearch}} +
T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,
where:
T~SI~ = the maximum time allowed aquire system information from a E-UTRAN
cell, 1280msec [24].
T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure, 30msec
[24]
T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in section
8.4a.2.6.1
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2
This gives a total of 65.70, allow 66 s in the test case.
#### A.5.5.5.5 Reselection to E-UTRA TDD when HS-DSCH DRX is configured
(E-UTRA has lower priority)
##### A.5.5.5.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to E-UTRAN cell
reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5.
This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1 E-UTRAN cell
to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1
UTRAN carrier and 1 E-UTRAN carrier. Test parameters are given in Table,
A.5.4X, A.5.4Y, A.5.4Z. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1 and T2, respectively. Both UTRA cell 1 and E-UTRA cell 2
are already identified by the UE prior to the start of the test. Cell 2 is of
lower priority than cell 1. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different
tracking areas.
CELL_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception and with only the first DRX
cycle active should be configured. The UE should not be scheduled with HS-DSCH
data during T1 and T2 such that the DRX cycle becomes active.

#### A.5.5.5.7 Reselection to E-UTRA FDD with FACH measurement occasions
configured
##### A.5.5.5.7.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to E-UTRA cell re-
selection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5 with measurement occasions
configured.
This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1 E-UTRA FDD
cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 2
UMTS carriers, 12 GSM cells and 1 E-UTRA FDD carrier. Test parameters are
given in Table, A.5.4ZF, A.5.4ZG and A.5.4ZH. During time phase T1, the E-UTRA
cell can be identified but is not sufficiently strong to trigger reselection.
Cell 2 is of higher priority than cell 1. The GERAN neighbour cells are not
assigned any absolute priority.
The transport and physical parameters of the S-CCPCH carrying the FACH are
defined in Table A.5.4ZD and Table A.5.4ZE.

##### A.5.5.5.7.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to
perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 2.5 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE1: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{measurement,\ E-UTRAN}} +
\text{40} + T_{\text{BCCH}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ ms
where
T~measurement,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to measure E-UTRA RSRP or RSRQ, as defined in
section 8.4.2.6.2, 1120ms.
T~BCCH~ = The maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from the E-UTRAN cell,
1280ms [24].T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure, 30msec [24]
This gives a total of 2460ms, allow 2.5 seconds in the test case.
NOTE2: The reselection delay is based on N~freq~=2 since measurements of GERAN
are not required by the higher layers in this scenario.
#### A.5.5.5.8 Reselection to E-UTRA TDD with FACH measurement occasions
configured
##### A.5.5.5.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to E-UTRA cell re-
selection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5 with measurement occasions
configured.

cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 2
UMTS carriers, 12 GSM cells and 1 E-UTRA TDD carrier. Test parameters are
given in Table, A.5.4ZK, A.5.4ZL and A.5.5.4ZM. During time phase T1, the
E-UTRA cell can be identified but is not sufficiently strong to trigger

#### A.5.6.2.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to send
preambles on the PRACH for sending the CELL UPDATE message with cause value
\"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateFDD~ + T~SI~,
where:
T~evaluateFDD~: See section 5.6.2.
T~SI~: Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

#### A.5.6.3.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 3, and starts to send the
RR Channel Request message for location update to Cell 3.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 2,75 s + T~BCCH,~ where T~BCCH~
is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell [21].
During T1 and T2 the MTCH SDU ER shall not exceed 4.0%.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: Max(3* T~measureFDD~,
T~measureGSM~+DRX cycle length) + T~BCCH~, where:
T~measureFDD~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.
T~measureGSM~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

The initial power shall be set equal to the DPCH_Ec/Ior of Cell 1 at the end of T2. Note 4: The relative delay of the path from cell 2 with respect to cell 1 shall always be within ±148 chip. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
#### A.5.8.1.1 Test procedure
1) The test is started at the beginning of T1.
2) During time period T2 an Event 1D triggered measurement report shall be
sent by the UE.
3) During time period T3 UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel Configuration
command with activation time now changing serving HS-DSCH from cell 1 to cell
2. The Physical Channel Configuration message shall be sent to the UE so that
the whole message is available at the UE at the beginning of T4.
### A.5.8.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to transmit the CQI to cell 2 less than 74 ms from the
beginning of time period T4.
The UE shall also start to receive the first HS-SCCH message from cell 2 less
than 74 ms from the beginning of time period T4 and transmit the ACK or NAK
which corresponds to the HS-SCCH message.
NOTE: The delay D~cell_change~ equals the RRC procedure delay defined in
TS25.331 Section 13.5.2 plus the interruption time of receiving HS-DSCH data
stated in section 5.10.2.2.\ The RRC procedure delay is 50 ms and the
interruption time is given by Tinterrupt1=T~IU~+22 ms=24 ms.
The total delay D~cell_change~=50 + 24 ms = 74 ms.
## A.5.9 Enhanced Serving HS-DSCH cell change
### A.5.9.1 Test Purpose and Environment
This test case is only applicable to UEs which support enhanced HS-DSCH
serving cell change.
The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the delay when
performing the enhanced serving HS-DSCH cell change in CELL_DCH state
specified in section 5.11.
The test parameters are given in Table A.5.15 and A.5.16 below. The test
consists of 4 successive time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2, T3 and
T4 respectively. At the start of time duration T1 the UE has cell 1 and cell 2
in the active set and cell 1 as the serving HS-DSCH cell. Target cell
preconfiguration is provided for cell 2 in the active set update. The target
cell preconfiguration shall not contain the optional IE "Activation time
offset". After sending event 1D during time period T2, the UE should start to
monitor HS-SCCH-1 from cell 2. A single HS-SCCH order implying serving cell
change starts to be transmitted from cell 2 during T3. By the start of T4, the
single HS-SCCH order implying serving cell change completes transmission, and
within the time specified in section 5.11 the UE shall also be monitoring the
HS-SCCH-2 on target cell 2.
Data shall be transmitted continuously to the UE on the HS-DSCH channel of
cell 1 during T1 and T2, and on the HS-DSCH channel of cell2 during T4.

#### A.5.9.1.1 Test procedure
1) The test is started at the beginning of T1.
2) During time period T2 an Event 1D triggered measurement report shall be
sent by the UE.
3) During time period T3 UTRAN shall send an HS-SCCH order on HS-SCCH-1from
cell 2 implying enhanced serving HS-DSCH from cell 1 to cell 2. The HS-SCCH
order message shall be sent to the UE so that the end of the TTI containing
the HS-SCCH order corresponds to the beginning of T4.
4) At the start of T4, UTRAN shall transmit data to the UE using HS-SCCH-2 and
HS-PDSCH on cell 2. Any ACK/NACK received from the UE indicates that the UE is
monitoring HS-SCCH-2
### A.5.9.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall start to receive the first HS-SCCH message on HS-SCCH-2 from cell
2 within no more than 40 ms from the beginning of time period T4 and transmit
the ACK or NACK which corresponds to the HS-SCCH message.
Note: Since HS-SCCH-2 on cell 2 is the only HS-SCCH which is being transmitted
from the start of T4, either ACK or NACK transmission from the UE after the
start of T4 implies that the enhanced serving cell change has been completed.
The rate of correct serving cell changes observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.
## A.5.10 Intrafrequency System information acquisition for CSG cell
### A.5.10.1 Test Purpose and Environment

### A.5.11.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall transmit a measurement report containing the cell identity, CSG
identity of cell 2 and membership indication set to FALSE within [1.96]
seconds from the start of T3.
Test requirement = RRC Procedure delay + T~CSG-SI-Report~
= 50+ [630]+40*32 from the start of T3
= [1.96] seconds.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled..
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x TTI~UL\
DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI
insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.
The measured quality on the DTCH of the UE downlink measured from the start of
T3 until 1.96 seconds after the start of T3 using loopback shall not exceed
BLER= 0.612
a) NOTE: The test BLER is defined from the requirements as follows:
b) 600ms of downlink interruption and 600ms of uplink interruption may occur =
30 DTCH TTI
c) Due to loopback delay (up to 10 TTI), this means that 30 + 30 = 60 TTI
loopback throughput may be lost due to gaps in uplink and downlink
d) There are 98 TTI in the test interval (1.96 seconds)
e) The remaining 98-60 = 38 TTI should have a BLER not exceeding 0.001+30% =
0.0013
Overall maximum allowed BLER is (38/98)*0.0013 + (60/98)*1 = 0.612
# A.6 RRC Connection Control

The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow uplink
transmission at the highest bit rate (UL_TFC8 or UL_TFC9) during the entire
test and it shall be ensured that the UE is using UL_TFC8 or UL_TFC9 at the

The test shall be performed in the following way:
**Before time period T1:**
The allowed TFCS according to table A.6.10 shall be signalled to the UE.
**During time period T1:**
The system simulator shall ensure that the UE output power is commanded to be
between 14 to 15 dB below the UE Maximum allowed UL TX power.

beginning of T2 until the end of T2.
NOTE: This will emulate that UL_TFC8 to UL_TFC9 can not be supported beacuse
the UE reaches the maximum UL Tx power and still UTRAN is sending power-up
commands. The time from the beginning of T2 until the UE blocks (stops using)
UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9 shall be measured.

The UE shall have stopped using UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9 within 140 ms from
beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The delay from the begining of T2 can be expressed as:
T~ramp~ + T~detect_block~ + T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1_proc~ + T~align_TTI~
where:
T~ramp~ Margin added for the increase of UE output power to the UE maximum
power. A margin of 1 frame (10ms) is used, i.e. 15 TPC commands.
T~detect_block~ The time needed to detect that UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9 can no
longer be supported, i.e. defines the maximum time to detect that the
_Elimination_ criterion is fulfilled for UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9. According to X
and Y values of 15 and 30 as defined in Section 6.4.2 and by assuming the
maximum misalignment between the frame boundary, where the evaluation of the
_Elimination_ criterion is performed and the last slot needed for triggering
the _Elimination_ criterion on L1, T~detect_block~ becomes 15 slots +14 slots
=19.33 ms.
T~notify~ Equal to 15 ms, the time allowed for MAC to indicate to higher
layers that UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9 can no longer be supported.
T~modify~ Equal to MAX(T~adapt_max~,T~TTI~) = MAX(0, 40)=40ms
T~adapt_max~ Equals to 0ms for the case without codec.
T~L1_proc~ Equals 15ms.
T~align_TTI~ Align with the longest uplink TTI where the new TFC can be
selected. The worst case equals 40ms in this test case.
T~TTI~ See section 6.4.2. Equals 40 ms in the test case.
This gives a maximum delay of (10 + 19.33 + 15 + 40 + 15 + 40) ms= 139.33 ms
from the beginning of T2, allow 140 ms in the test case.

## A.6.6 E-TFC restriction in UE
### A.6.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose is to verify the UE stops using a currently used E-TFC when its
remaining power margin is not sufficient to support that E-TFC, and resumes
using that E-TFC when its remaining power margin is sufficient to support it.
This test will verify the general requirement on E-TFC selection in section
6.4.
#### A.6.6.1.1 10ms TTI E-DCH E-TFC restriction testcase
The test will verify the general requirement on E-TFC restriction and recovery
in section 6.4 for a 10ms TTI E-DCH Transport Block Size Table 0 [19].
The test parameters are given in Table A.6.14 below. The test consists of 2
time periods, with a time duration of T1 and T2 respectively.
The UE shall be configured to transmit UL DTCH data continuously on the DPCH.

The radio conditions in the test shall be sufficient, so that decoding of the
TPC commands can be made without errors.
The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow E-DCH uplink
transmission at the highest possible bit rate with E-DCH TB index 127\. It
shall also be ensured that sufficient data is made available on the DTCH so
that the UE is continuously transmitting on the DPCH.
The test shall be performed in the following way:
**Initial conditions:**
Call is established with DCH, HSDPA and E-DCH radio bearers. An absolute grant
with the value 31 is sent on the E-AGCH to give the UE sufficient grants to
make use of the maximum possible data rate.
**Before time period T1:**
The UE shall be transmitting at its maximum DPCCH power and the UE uplink
E-DPCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI with index 0.
**During time period T1:**
From the start of T1 the system simulator shall send sufficient consecutive
TPC_cmd= -1 to the UE until the DPCCH power is between 0dBm and 1dBm for a
power class 3 UE, or between -4dBm and -3dBm for a power class 4 UE. Within
45ms from the start of T1, the UE uplink E-DPCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI
127, or the E-TFCI which represents the maximum of the UE's capabilities.
**Before time period T2:**
The UE P~DPCCH~ power shall be between 0dBm and 1dBm for a power class 3 UE,
or between -4dBm and -3dBm for a power class 4 UE, and the UE uplink E-DPCCH
shall indicate either be not transmitted or use of E-TFCI 127, or the E-TFCI
which represents the maximum of the UE's capabilities.
**During time period T2:**
The system simulator shall continuously send TPC_cmd=1 to the UE from the
beginning of T2 until the end of T2. Within 45ms from the start of T2, the UE
uplink E-DPCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI with index 0.
> NOTE: During this phase the UE may perform DTX of the E-DPDCH in accordance
> with [18] clause 5.1.2.6.
Time periods T1 and T2 shall be repeated until the necessary statistical
confidence is achieved.
##### A.6.6.1.1.1 Test Requirements
During time period T1, uplink power control shall be adjusted so that the UE
is able to make use of E-TFC index 127, or the maximum of its capabilities if
this is lower.
NOTE: The required headroom to support E-TFC 127 can be calculated using the
parameters L~ref~=1, K~ref~=18 and K~127~=20000. This requires
{(5006)*3+12}*4=60120 before rate matching/ARQ. This can be transmitted on
2xSF/2 codes, so needs equivalent of 4xSF/4 codes, giving L~127~=4.
Substituting into the equation for β~ed,j,harq~ from 25.214:
gives
β~ed,j,harq~= 5 * sqrt (1/4) * sqrt (20000 / 18) = 83.333
For the SF/2 case, the unquantised gain factor _β~ed,k,j,uq~_ for each of
these two codes is according to
_β~ed,k,j,uq~=_ _β~ed,k,j,uq~=_
_β~ed,k,j,uq~=_ sqrt(2) * 83.333 = 117.85
_β~ed,k~_ is set such that _β~ed,k~_ /_β~c~_ is the largest quantized value of
Table 1B.2 in [3] subclause 4.2.1.3, for which the condition _β~ed,k~_ ≤
_β~ed,k,j,uq~_ holds.
According to 25.213 Table 1B.2 in subclause 4.2.1.3, the corresponding
quantised amplitude ratio has index 25,\ A~ed~ = β~ed~/β~c~= 106/15 for each
of the two SF/2 E-DPDCH codes.
The E-TFC selection MPR for this case from 25.133 table 6.2 corresponds to
case 6, or an E-TFC MPR of 0.5dB.
$\begin{matrix} \text{NRPM}j = \left( \text{PMax}_{j} - P_{\text{DPCCH}} -
P_{\text{DPDCH}} - P_{\text{HS} - \text{DPCCH}} - P_{E - \text{DPCCH}}
\right)/P_{\text{DPCCH}} \ \frac{\text{PMax}_{j}}{P_{\text{DPCCH}}} -
\frac{\beta_{c}^{2} + \beta_{d}^{2} + \beta_{\text{ec}}^{2} +
\beta_{\text{hs}}^{2}}{\beta_{c}^{2}} \
\frac{\text{PMax}_{j}}{P_{\text{DPCCH}}} - \left( 1 +
\frac{\beta_{d}^{2}}{\beta_{c}^{2}} + A_{\text{ec}}^{2} + A_{\text{hs}}^{2}
\right) \ \end{matrix}$
For a power class 3 UE PMax~j~ = 23.5dBm = 223.87mW, or for a power class 4
UE, PMax~j~ = 20.5dBm = 112.20mW
The inequality for support of E-TFC with index 127 is
223.87/P~DPCCH~ - (1+ (9^2^/15^2^) + 2^2^ + 2^2^ ) ≥ 106^2^/15^2^ +
106^2^/15^2^ (class 3)
112.20/P~DPCCH~ - (1+ (9^2^/15^2^) + 2^2^ + 2^2^ ) ≥ 106^2^/15^2^ +
106^2^/15^2^ (class 4)
This is satisfied if P~DPCCH~ ≤ (223.87/109.23) = 2.04mW = 3.11dBm for a class
3 UE or P~DPCCH~ ≤ (112.20/109.23) = 1.03mW = 0.12dBm for a class 4 UE.
From table 6.0A the accuracy of the P~DPCCH~ estimate used for E-TFC selection
in this scenario is ±2dB for power class 3 or ±2.5dB for power class 4.
Therefore, for P~DPCCH~ ≤ 1.11dBm (class 3) or -2.38dBm (class 4), the UE
shall be able to support E-TFC index 127. Since power control granularity is
1dB, the UE output power should be maintained so that 0dBm ≤ P~DPCCH~ ≤ 1dBm
throughout this phase for a class 3 UE, or so that -4dBm ≤ P~DPCCH~ ≤ -3dBm
throughout this phase for a class 4 UE.
NOTE: Test tolerance may need to be added to further reduce the UE DPCCH power
further by RAN5, depending on how accurately tester can set and maintain UE
DPCCH power.
NOTE: The required time to start using E-TFC index 127 or the maximum of the
UEs cababilites at the beginning of T1, and to start using E-TFC with index 0
at the beginning of T2 can be calculated as follows.
Since TPC commands are received error free by the UE, P~DPCCH~ shall reach the
new power level power within 25 slots = 16.666ms.
The UE shall have evaluated and started to use the new restriction criteria
with T~s~ = (Power level change time + P~DPCCH~ filtering period + E-TFC
estimation rate + Maximum time from RGCH reception to E-TFC transmission) from
the start of the time period
= 16.66ms + 10ms + 10ms + 7.53ms
= 44.19ms, allow 45ms
The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
#### A.6.6.1.2 2ms TTI E-DCH E-TFC restriction testcase
The test will verify the general requirement on E-TFC restriction and recovery
in section 6.4 for a 2ms TTI E-DCH Transport Block Size Table 0 [19].
The test parameters are given in Table A.6.15 below. The test consists of 2
time periods, with a time duration of T1 and T2 respectively.
The UE shall be configured to transmit UL DTCH data continuously on the DPCH.
An HSDPA radio bearer shall be configured so that the UE transmits ACK and UL
HS-DPCCH. An E-DCH radio bearer shall be configured, so that UE is
transmitting E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH.

23ms from the start of T1, the UE uplink E-DPCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI
127, or the E-TFCI which represents the maximum of the UE's capabilities.
**Before time period T2:**
The UE P~DPCCH~ power shall be between 2dBm and 3dBm for a power class 3 UE,
or between -1dBm and 0dBm for a power class 4 UE, and the UE uplink E-DPCCH

**During time period T2:**
The system simulator shall continuously send TPC_cmd=1 to the UE from the
beginning of T2 until the end of T2. Within 23ms from the start of T2, the UE
uplink E-DPCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI with index 0.
> NOTE: During this phase the UE may perform DTX of the E-DPDCH in accordance

**Time periods T1 and T2 shall be repeated until the necessary statistical

### A.6.6.1.2.1 Test Requirements
During time period T1, uplink power control shall be adjusted so that the UE
is able to make use of E-TFC index 127, or the maximum of its capabilities if
this is lower.
NOTE: The required headroom to support E-TFC 127 can be calculated using the
parameters L~ref~=1, K~ref~=18 and K~127~=11484. This requires {(3836)*3+12}*3
=34560 bits before rate matching/ARQ. This can be transmitted on 2xSF/2 codes
and 2xSF/4 codes, so needs equivalent of 6xSF/4 codes, giving L~127~=6.
Substituting into the equation for β~ed,j,harq~ from 25.214:
gives
βed,j,harq= 5 * sqrt (1/6) * sqrt (11484 / 18) = 51.56
For the SF/2 codes, the unquantised gain factor _β~ed,k,j,uq~_ for each of
these two codes is according to _β~ed,k,j,uq~=_ _β~ed,k,j,uq~=_
ed,k,j,uq= sqrt(2) * 51.56 = 72.91
And for the SF/4 codes, the unquantised gain factor is _β~ed,k,j,uq~_ =51.56
_β~ed,k~_ is set such that _β~ed,k~_ /_β~c~_ is the largest quantized value of
Table 1B.2 in [3] subclause 4.2.1.3, for which the condition _β~ed,k~_ ≤
_β~ed,k,j,uq~_ holds.
According to 25.213 Table 1B.2 in subclause 4.2.1.3, the corresponding
quantised amplitude ratio are A~ed~ = β~ed~/β~c~= 67/15 for each of the two
SF/2 E-DPDCH codes and A~ed~ = β~ed~/β~c~= 47/15 for each of the two SF/4
codes
The E-TFC selection MPR for this case from 25.133 table 6.2 is 0.0dB.
For a power class 3 UE PMax~j~ = 24dBm = 251.2mW, or for a power class 4 UE,
PMax~j~ = 21dBm = 125.9mW
The inequality for support of E-TFC with index 127 is
251.2/P~DPCCH~ - (1+ (9^2^/15^2^) + 2^2^ + 2^2^ ) ≥ 47^2^/15^2^ + 47^2^/15^2^
+67^2^/15^2^ + 67^2^/15^2^ (class 3)
125.9/P~DPCCH~ - (1+ (9^2^/15^2^) + 2^2^ + 2^2^ ) ≥ 47^2^/15^2^ + 47^2^/15^2^
+67^2^/15^2^ + 67^2^/15^2^ (class 4)
This is satisfied if P~DPCCH~ ≤ (251.2/68.9) = 3.64mW = 5.61dBm for a class 3
UE or P~DPCCH~ ≤ (125.9/68.9) = 1.82mW = 2.61dBm for a class 4 UE.
From table 6.0A the accuracy of the Pdpcch estimate used for E-TFC selection
in this scenario is ±2dB for power class 3 or ±2.5dB for power class 4.
Therefore, for P~DPCCH~ ≤ 3.61dBm (class 3) or 0.11dBm (class 4), the UE shall
be able to support E-TFC index 127. Since power control granularity is 1dB,
the UE output power should be maintained so that 2dBm ≤ P~DPCCH~ ≤ 3dBm
throughout this phase for a class 3 UE, or so that -1dBm ≤ P~DPCCH~ ≤ 0dBm
throughout this phase for a class 4 UE.
NOTE: Test tolerance may need to be added to further reduce the UE DPCCH power
further by RAN5, depending on how accurately tester can set and maintain UE
DPCCH power.
NOTE: The required time to start using E-TFC index 127 or the maximum of the
UEs cababilites at the beginning of T1, and to start using E-TFC with index 0
at the beginning of T2 can be calculated as follows.
Since TPC commands are received error free by the UE, P~DPCCH~ shall reach the
new power level power within 20 slots = 13.33ms.
The UE shall have evaluated and started to use the new restriction criteria
with T~s~ = (Power level change time + Pdpcch filtering period \+ E-TFC
estimation rate + Maximum time from RGCH reception to E-TFC transmission) from
the start of the time period
= 13.33ms + 2ms + 2ms + 5.53ms
= 22.86ms, allow 23ms
The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.

#### A.8.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of

### A.8.2E.2 Test Requirements
a) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 17 = 50 * (480/7.05) * 1* 5
seconds from the beginning of time period T2.
b) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for cell 3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 17 seconds from the beginning of
time period T2.
c) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for cell 4,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 17 seconds from the beginning of
time period T2.
Measurement reporting delay can be expressed as: $T_{\text{measurement}\
\text{\ inter}} = \text{Max}\left{ T_{\text{Measurement_Period\
Inter}},T_{\text{basic}\ \text{measurement}\ \text{FDD\ inter}} \cdot
\frac{T_{\text{Measurement_Period\ Inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter}}} \cdot K_{n}
\cdot N_{\text{freq},n} \right}\text{ms}$
which is described in section 8.1.2.3.2.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x TTI~UL\
DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI
insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

## A.8.5A CSG Proximity Indication Testing Case for UTRAN FDD -- FDD Inter
frequency
Note : The test case in this section forms the basis for a signalling test for
CSG proximity detection.
### A.8.5A.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify the UE has implemented properly the
feature for indicating that the UE is entering or leaving the proximity of one
or more CSG member cells based on proximity detection with an autonomous
search function as defined by the requirements in Section 6.7.
The test case consists of three successive segments: Test Preparation,
Negative Test, and Positive Test. The test scenario comprises of three UTRAN
FDD cells on different carriers. Cell 1 represents the serving cell in the
proximity of the CSG cell, Cell 2 the CSG cell and Cell 3 the serving cell not
in the proximity of the CSG cell. The description of the test procedure is
shown in Table A.8.5A-1. The general test parameters and cell specific test
parameters are presented in Table A.8.5A-2 and Table A.8.5A-3 respectively.

#### A.8.6.4.2 Test Requirements
The measurement delay is defined as the time from the beginning of period T2
and the moment at which the UE starts to send preambles on the PRACH to send
the MEASUREMENT REPORT message.
The measurement delay shall be less than 5 seconds.
NOTE: The measurement delay can be expressed as: $T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}}
+ T_{\text{RA}}$, where:
T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure described
in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be 1 in this test
case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.
T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in section
8.4a.2.6.1.
### A.8.6.5 Correct reporting of E-UTRAN FDD neighbours in fading propagation
condition in CELL_DCH for Increased Carrier Monitoring with reduced
performance group configured
#### A.8.6.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event when doing measurements on E-UTRAN FDD cells. The test will partly
verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.6.
The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration T1, T2
and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.24A, A.8.25A, A.8.25A and
A.8.26AA. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Events 3B and 3C shall be used.

#### A.8.6.5.2 Test Requirements
If the UE needs compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements:
\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 12.12 seconds from the beginning
of time period T2.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 84.8 seconds from the beginning
of time period T2.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 4,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 84.8 seconds from the beginning
of time period T2.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 2.195 s from the beginning of
time period T3.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the beginning of
time period T3.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 4,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the beginning of
time period T3.
If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements:
\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 4,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 2.195 s from the beginning of
time period T3.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the beginning of
time period T3.
\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 4,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the beginning of
time period T3.
\- The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x TTI~UL\
DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because of TTI
insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.
### A.8.6.6 Correct reporting of E-UTRAN TDD neighbours in fading propagation
condition in CELL_DCH for Increased Carrier Monitoring with reduced
performance group configured
#### A.8.6.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event when doing measurements on E-UTRAN TDD cells. The test will partly
verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.6.
The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration T1, T2
and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.27A, A.8.28A, A.8.29A and
A.8.29AA. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Events 3B and 3C shall be used.

## A.8.7 Combined Interfrequency and E-UTRAN measurements
### A.8.7.1 Correct reporting of E-UTRA FDD neighbours in fading propagation
condition
#### A.8.7.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of
an event when doing inter frequency and E-UTRAN FDD measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.3 and 8.1.2.6. The
requirements are also applicable for a UE not requiring compressed mode for
inter-frequency or inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD measurements. In case a UE is not
requiring compressed mode for inter-frequency measurements no compressed mode
pattern with measurement purpose \"FDD measurement\" should be sent and in
case a UE is not requiring compressed mode for inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurements
no compressed mode pattern with measurement purpose \"E-UTRAN measurements\"
should be sent for the parameters specified in table A8.30.
The test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations T1 and
T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.30, A.8.31 and A.8.32 below.
In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event 2B and 3A shall be used.

#### A.8.7.2.2 Test Requirements
The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report for Cell2, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 5.14 s from the beginning of time period
T2.
The UE shall send one Event 3A triggered measurement report for Cell3, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 8.23 s from the beginning of time period
T2.
NOTE: The delay for interfrequency cell detection is equal to:
$T_{\text{identify,}\ \text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\
\text{FDD,inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\
Inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter}}} \cdot N_{\text{Freq}}$ ms = 5143 ms
where:
$T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD,inter}}$ is specified in

$T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\ Inter}}$ is specified in 8.1.2.3.2 as
480 ms
and
$T_{\text{Inter}}$ is specified in 8.1.2.3.2 as 6 gaps of length 7 slots each,
28 ms
NOTE: The delay for interRAT cell detection is equal to:
$T_{\text{Identify,E-UTRAN}} = N_{\text{freq},E - \text{UTRA}} \cdot
T_{\text{Basic_Identify_E-UTRAN\ }} \cdot
\frac{\text{480}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$ = 8229 ms
where:
T~Basic_Identify_E-UTRAN~ is specified in 8.1.2.6 as 480 ms
and
T~E-UTRAN~ is specified in 8.1.2.6 as 6 gaps of length 7 slots each, 28 ms
# A.9 Measurement Performance Requirements
Unless explicitly stated:
\- Reported measurements shall be within defined range in 90 % of the cases.
\- Measurement channel is 12.2 kbps as defined in TS 25.101 annex A, sub-
clause A.3.1. This measurement channel is used both in active cell and cells
to be measured.
\- Physical channels used as defined in TS 25.101 annex C.
\- Cell 1 is the active cell when in CELL_DCH state.
\- Single task reporting.

### A.9.1.3 UTRA Carrier RSSI
#### A.9.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the UTRA Carrier RSSI measurement
accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will verify the
requirements in section 9.1.3. In this case all cells are in different
frequencies and compressed mode is applied. The gap length is 7, detailed
definition is in TS 25.101 annex A.5, Set 1 of Table A.22. UTRA Carrier RSSI
accuracy requirements are tested by using test parameters in Table A.9.5 for
absolute accuracy and Table A.9.5.1 for relative accuracy. In the relative
accuracy test, UTRA carrier RSSI measurements of neighbour cell 2 and
neighbour cell 3 are reported to serving cell 1.

##### A.9.1.9.1.1 Test Procedure
1) Set the maximum allowed uplink transmit power (_P_ ~max~) to the maximum
power for that UE power class.
2) Use uplink power control commands to set the UE DPCCH power to a level
(_P_) where the UE power headroom is at least 31dB.
3) Measure the power transmitted by the UE on DPCCH every time slot. The DPCCH
output power shall be averaged over 100 ms.
4) The total measured output power of the UE shall be averaged over 100 ms.
5) Estimate the reference UE transmission power headroom as the difference
between the maximum allowed uplink transmit power (_P_ ~max~) and the average
DPCCH power measured in step 3.
6) Check the UE reported value of UE transmission power headroom.
7) Check the accuracy limits according to table 9.34B for the total output
power measured in step 4).
8) The difference between the reported UPH in step 6) and estimated reference
UPH in step 5) shall be within the accuracy limits obtained in step 7).
9) Increase the variable _P_ by 1 dB.
10) Repeat from step 2) until the UPH is tested over the entire dynamic range.

### A.9.1.14 E-UTRAN FDD RSRP Absolute Accuracy for 5 MHz Bandwidth
#### A.9.1.14.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement
absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will verify the
requirements in section 9.1.4a.
The test is carried out in Cell_DCH state using a compressed mode pattern with
purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern repeats every 80 ms
and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details are found in TS 25.101
annex A.5.
Tables A.9.1.14.1-1 and A.9.1.14.1-2 define the limits of signal strengths and
code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is applicable. In the
measurement control information periodic reporting of E-UTRAN FDD RSRP is
indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN FDD test parameters are given in Table
A.9.1.14.1-3.

### A.9.1.20 E-UTRA FDD WB-RSRQ Absolute Accuracy (CELL_DCH)
#### A.9.1.20.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN FDD WB-RSRQ measurement
absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will verify the
requirements in section 9.1.4c.
The test is carried out in Cell_DCH state using a compressed mode pattern with
purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern repeats every 80 ms
and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details are found in annex A.5 of
TS 25.101 [3].
Tables A.9.1.20.1-1 and A.9.1.20.1-2 define the limits of signal strengths and
code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is applicable. In the
measurement control information periodic reporting of E-UTRAN WB-RSRQ is
indicated to the UE. The measurement control message received by the UE shall
also contain the IE "_Wideband RSRQ measurements_ " and "_Measurement
Bandwidth_ " defined in TS 25.331 [16].
