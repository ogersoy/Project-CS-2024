# 4 Introduction
The present document describes the methods to be used in order to assess the
radio performances of the 3G user equipment/mobile stations (UE/MS) in active
mode in both the up- and the downlink. The test procedure is based on the test
method developed as a result of COST 273 Sub-Working Group (SWG) 2.2 members\'
contributions and the first draft was published in [1]. Background work has
also been made in the former COST259 project [2] [3].
## 4.1 Scope
The measurement procedure explained in this document applies to two classes of
UE/MS products, one is the UE/MS used under the \"speech mode\" conditions
that correspond to predefined positions (see Chapter 5) for voice application
when the handset is held close to the user\'s head. And the other class is the
laptop mounted equipment, including the wireless devices embedded into the
laptop and the plug-in type device that host on the laptop. This method is
also applicable to free space measurements.
The testing methodology applies to any 3G handset, with internal or external
antenna, with single or multiple receive antennas, that supports both the
speech mode and the data transfer mode. It is also applicable to the testing
of dual-mode (GSM / UMTS) terminals. Specific technical details related to
testing of GSM mode of the dual-mode terminals are addressed in Appendix D.
The radio tests considered here are:
  1. The measurement of the radiated output power
  2. The measurement of the radiated sensitivity
The test procedure described in this document measures the performance of the
transmitter and the receiver, including the antenna and also the effects of
the user.
The purpose of this document is to serve as a standard test procedure for
radio performance testing of mobile terminals. It is the intention that this
procedure is going to be used by test houses, network operators, mobile
terminal and antenna manufacturers, research institutes etc. The motivation
for the development of this document is the lack of standards in this area in
3GPP [4]. COST 273 SWG2.2 has reported the progress of the pre-standardization
in several 3GPP RAN4 meetings [5] [6].
The major parts of this test procedure are based on the 3-D pattern
measurement method. It has been considered necessary to define some items and
components in the test procedure in detail, such as test channels and phantom
set-ups, in order to make the testing in different laboratories harmonized.
The procedure is, however, not limited to some specific antenna chambers or
positioners, but just gives examples of systems that are presently available.
Moreover, the pre-standard is open for the use of some alternative to the 3-D
pattern measurement method, provided that the specified performance parameters
and the total measurement uncertainty can be achieved with the alternative
test method. In the first phase the pre-standard uses TRP (Total Radiated
Power) and TRS (Total Radiated Sensitivity) as the performance parameters but
it is also prepared for the use of Mean Effective Gain (MEG) (or Mean
Effective Radiated Power (MERP) and its corresponding parameter Mean Effective
Radiated Sensitivity (MERS) for the receiver performance) as the preferred
performance parameter in a later stage.
Note: TRP and TRS are well-defined measures for the handset transmitter and
receiver performance in an isotropic field distribution with XPR = 1 (cross
polarisation ratio), whereas MEG [7], [8] also gives the handset performance
relative to a well-known reference and can take different values depending on
the chosen field distribution including the XPR.
A Reverberation Chamber Method [9] [10] has been introduced in the pre-
standard as an alternative test method for measuring total radiated power of
the 3G UE ([11], [12] [13]). At the moment it has a limitation that it does
not provide any possibility for the evaluation of MEG.
## 4.2 Future extensions
The TRS test method presented in this document is based on combined TRS
measurement for devices with multiple receive antennas. Further enhancements
for radiated UE receiver verifications are developed under the MIMO OTA WI in
RP-120368 and therefore combined TRS test method may eventually be revisited.
The test procedure presented in this document can be applied also for the
testing of possible non-cellular systems in the 3G UE, such as Bluetooth (BT),
General Positioning System (GPS), or Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN).
# 5 Initial Conditions
The main objective of this section is to define basic parameters of simulated
user (phantom) and anechoic chamber suited for the Tx and Rx measurement of
UMTS mobile handsets.
## 5.1 Phantom specifications
### 5.1.1 Head phantom
The Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) is used for radiated performance
measurements. The phantom shape is derived from the size and dimensions of the
90-th percentile large adult male reported in an anthropometric study. It has
also been adapted to represent the flattened ear of a wireless device user.
For DUT radiated performance measurements in \"intended use\" position SAM
head phantom without a shoulder section will be used.
The shell of the SAM phantom should be made of low-loss material (loss tangent
less than 0.05) with low permittivity (less than 5). The thickness has to be
2.0±0.2mm in the areas close to the handset in \"intended use\" position.
The phantom has to be filled with tissue simulating liquid. It is recommended
to use one of the typical SAR tissue simulating liquids and Appendix B gives
four example recipes of such liquids. It is also recommended to verify the RF
properties of the liquid with suitable equipment. The values should be
maintained within 15% of the values relative permittivity 40 (±15%) and sigma
1.4 (±15%) at 1900 MHz. If the difference is more than ±15%, it should be
taken in to account in the uncertainty budget. Dielectric properties
measurement methods can be found e.g. in [22] [23].
Alternatively a dry SAM phantom made of plastic material with corresponding
electrical parameters can be used.
Note: Measurements have that the radiated performance of a terminal can be
influenced by the hand presence. However, it is very difficult to develop a
standardized hand phantom, which could allow pertinent and reproducible
measurements. Therefore a phantom hand is not included in this test procedure.
### 5.1.2 DUT Positioning on head phantom
The DUT is attached to the SAM phantom in \"cheek\" position as defined both
by IEEE [19] and CELENEC [20] standards. The DUT performance is measured on
both left and right side of the head.
Three points as shown in Fig. 5.1 define the reference plane: center of the
right ear piece (RE), center of the left ear piece (LE) and center of mouth
(M).
At first, set the DUT ready for operation.
Definition of the \'Cheek\' position:
1) Align the ear piece of the phone (see Fig. 5.1) at the line RE-LE. Then,
position the DUT beside the phantom so that the vertical line (see Fig. 5.3)
is parallel to the reference plane in Fig. 5.2 and is aligned with the line
M-RE on the reference plane (see Fig. 5.3).
```{=html}
``` 1) Position the DUT so that the ear piece of the DUT touches the ear piece
of the phantom head on the line RE-LE. Tilt the DUT chassis towards the cheek
of the phantom having the vertical line aligned with the reference plane until
any point on the front side of the DUT is in contact with the cheek or until
the contact with the ear is lost.
NOTE: A holder fixture made of e.g. plastic may be used to position the
handset against the phantom. An experimental study presented in [25] shows
that some plastic holders might introduce an unexpectedly large effect to the
measurement results. Therefore, special care must be seen when selecting such
fixtures for radiated measurements.

### 5.1.3 Laptop Ground Plane Phantom
A laptop ground plane phantom is used for radiated performance measurements in
case of plug-in DUT like USB dongles. The objective of the laptop ground plane
phantom is to reproduce the effects of the ground plane for the antenna of the
DUT while avoiding the variation of the measurements introduced by a real
laptop.
The laptop ground plane phantom, as showed in Figure 5.4, is composed by the
following parts,:
\- a rectangular plane covered by a conductive film on the upper side with
thickness of 4mm to emulate the keyboard and main body of the laptop;
\- a rectangular plane covered by the same conductive film on the upper side
with thicknessof 4mm to emulate the screen of laptop;
\- the conductive film on the two planes is connected. The angle between the
two planes is 110 degrees. The material is FR-4 copper-clad sheet and the
length and width of these two planes are 345mm and 238mm respectively;
\- a horizontal USB connector placed along the short end of the plane; the
location of the port is at the right back corner, the distance between the
central axis of the USB connector and the rear edge of plane is 45mm, the
ground of the USB connector is welded on the conductive film of the plane. The
detailed description of the structure is presented in Figure 5.5;
\- a USB cable crossing the ground plane and connecting the USB connector to a
real functional laptop; the USB cable should be equipped with a shielded metal
film, and the portion of the cable that is hunged in the air shall be covered
with absorbing material or treated with quarter wave chokes. The part of the
USB cable lying on the plane is covered by a conductive adhesive strip used
for fixing the cable on the plane and for guarantying at the same time the
superficial continuity of the conductive plane. The shielded conductive film
of this part of the USB cable is connected to the conductive film of the plane
and the covered strip to well ground the antenna. The length of the USB cable
should be no more than 3 meters.

laptop
Figure 5.5: The structure and dimension of the laptop ground phantom
The real functional laptop is laid on the floor of the anechoic chamber,
supplies power to the DUT and controls the state of the DUT. Both the USB
cable and the real functional laptop are properly setup in order to have a
negligible impact on the measurements: the real functional laptop is fully
wrapped up with anechoic absorbers.
### 5.1.4 DUT Positioning on Laptop Ground Plane Phantom
The DUT is connected to the USB connector of the laptop ground plane phantom.
The DUT should be plugged into the USB connector and positioned in accordance
with the manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of
such a recommendation the DUT with either rotary USB porter or non-rotary USB
porter should be horizontally plugged into the horizontal USB connector, as
shown in Fig. 5.4.
### 5.1.5 Hand Phantoms
Users hand can have a great impact on radiated performance of a mobile
terminal. The impact goes beyond blocking or absorbing a portion of the
radiation, since the impedance of the antenna itself may be changed due to the
material in near field. Thus a standardized hand phantom has been developed
for radiated testing to reflect real world user scenarios [74].
#### 5.1.5.1 Dimensions
Dimensions of the hand phantom are based on 50^th^ percentile of the men's
hand and women's hand dimensions averaged together in order to produce a
standard hand phantom that lies in the middle of the expected range of users.
Figure 5.1.5.1-1 illustrates the segments of the human hand, and Table
5.1.5.1-1 summarizes the various dimensions for an open hand phantom [74].

#### 5.1.5.2 Dielectric properties
Dielectric properties of dry palm human tissue are set as the target
dielectric parameters for hand phantoms [75]. The properties are presented in
table 5.1.5.2-1. It's important that the hand phantom has equivalent
electrical properties to real human hand to ensure that the same near field
effects are seen with the hand phantom as would be seen with real hand.
Relative permittivity of hand phantoms shall be within ±15% of the values
listed in Table 5.1.5.2-1. Conductivity of hand phantoms shall be within ±25%
of the values listed in Table 5.1.5.2-1. Methods for measuring dielectric
properties can be found e.g. in [22] [23].

#### 5.1.5.3 Hand phantom grips
Hand phantom grips are based on human factor studies that were done to record
how a phone of certain form factor was gripped by a large sample of people.
Based on the grip study findings, three grip designs are chosen for 40- to
56-mm wide devices: one for mono-block devices used in a voice call, another
for fold devices in a voice call, and a third "data mode" grip, simulating for
example web browsing, Figure 5.1.5.3-1 showes mono-block and fold grips [76].
Grip studies showed that devices wider than 56 mm (generally PDA and touch
screen devices) could be conveniently accommodated by a single grip to cover
primary use cases, voice calls and data browsing [76].
Each grip is used with a spacer that is designed for repeatable positioning of
terminals to the grips. The material for the monoblock palm spacer shall be
hollow with a wall thickness less than 2 mm, and a dielectric constant of less
than 5.0 and a loss tangent of less than 0.05 or it shall besolid with a
dielectric constant of less than 1.3 and a loss tangent of less than 0.003.
Touch fastener material may be used to affix the DUT to the palm spacer.
Figures 5.1.5.3-1 and 5.1.5.3-2 below illustrate the right-handed and left-
handed mono-block and fold grips respectively.

#### 5.1.5.4 Mechanical Requirements of Hand Phantoms
The hand phantoms shall be constructed of a material that is sufficiently
flexible to accommodate the range of devices specified in 5.1.5.3. The
material shall also be made sufficiently stiff that the hand grip remains
constant under rotation.
Adequate material stiffness of the hand phantom is necessary to maintain high
repeatability of OTA measurements. The stiffness of the hand material shall be
verified by measuring the deflection of the index finger of a moulded
monoblock hand phantom under a given weight. Test procedure is following;
1\. Position the hand phantom such that the index finger is horizontal.
2\. Apply an indicator needle that extends horizontally 55 mm ±1 mm beyond the
tip of the index finger.
3\. Record the position of the indicator needle on a vertical scale.
4\. Apply 20 g ±0.2 g of weight centered 6 mm ±0.5 mm from the tip of the
index finger towards the hand.
5\. Record the new position of the indicator needle on a vertical scale.
The deflection of the index finger of the hand phantom shall be between 2 and
5 mm. Deflection less than 2 mm per 20 g weight indicates a material that is
too rigid. Deflection greater than 5 mm per 20 g weight indicates a material
that is too soft.

Figure 5.1.5.4-2. A weight container designed for a hand phantom stiffness
test.
A weight container presented in figure 5.1.514-2 may be used in the stiffness
test. It is assumed that other grips will have similar stiffness as the
monoblock hand from the same material. Therefore, a stiffness test of the
monoblock hand alone is considered sufficient.
### 5.1.6 DUT positioning for speech mode
Speech mode is simulation of a voice call user case. DUT is placed in to a
hand phantom which is holding the DUT against SAM head phantom. Positioning of
the DUT in the hand phantom varies with the grip being used. Positionig of the
DUT against the head phantom is identical to section 5.1.2, with the exeption
that 6°tilt agnle from the cheek is being used instead of having direct
contact between the cheek and DUT. A mask may be used to help configuration of
cheek + 6° tilt angle. The mask is a 32 mm wide conformal strip, created by
sweeping the surface of the head phantom through a 6º rotation about the ear.
Direct DUT contact against the mask thus establishes the required 6º spacing
away from the cheek, regardless of DUT form factor. The material for the head
phantom mask spacer shall have dielectric constant of less than 1.3 and a loss
tangent of less than 0.003. Material additions can be used to help fixing of
the mask spacer onto the head phantom.
#### 5.1.6.1 Mono-blocks and closed sliders
This procedure applies to mounting monoblock DUTs and closed-slide DUTs, when
the DUT is less than 56 mm wide. For consistent, repeatable positioning that
conforms to the grip studies, an alignment tool with evenly spaced rulings is
first used to measure the DUT. Alignment Tool A in fiqure 4, features a 120º
interior corner to ensure that the ring fingertip lands in the desired
position at the bottom of the DUT. The DUT is then positioned in accordance
with ruled markings on a conformal palm spacer regardless of any curvature in
the DUT corners. DUTs with rounded corners will sit lower in the tool than
DUTs having square corners, and thus give a different reading.
1 Place the DUT face-up in Alignment Tool A with its side along the side
ruler, and slide it down until it makes contact at the 120º corner. Record the
bottom location of the DUT by reading off the bottom ruler of Tool A.
2 Observe the top of the DUT against the side ruler of the tool. If the top of
the DUT extends past the 120 mm marking on the side ruler, then the additional
length beyond 120 mm shall be added to the reading from Step 1.
3 Place the DUT on the right-handed or left-handed hand phantom spacer between
the fingers. The bottom location of the DUT on the spacer should be aligned
with the reading recorded in step 1&2\. Vertical centerline of the DUT should
be centered with the spacer. Make sure index finger is in contact with DUT.
4 While keeping the DUT in the hand phantom in the position defined in
previous steps, place the DUT and the hand phantom against the head phantom in
such way that the DUT is in 6°tilt agnle as descriped in 5.1.6.

Figure 5.1.6.1-1 Aligment Tool A and right-handed mono-block hand phantom with
a spacer. The Aligment tool is used to determine DUT bottom location on
spacer. Use left-handed (mirror-imaged) spacers with left-handed phantoms.
#### 5.1.6.2 Folds and open-slides
This procedure applies to fold and open-slide DUTs, when the DUT is less than
56 mm wide. To help maintain a consistent, repeatable positioning that
conforms to the grip studies, an alignment tool with evenly spaced rulings is
first used to measure the DUT. The DUT is then positioned in accordance with
ruled markings on a phantom spacer. Alignment Tool B in figure 5.1.6.2-1
features two rounded humps upon which the DUT is suspended. One hump
represents the index fingertip of the hand phantom, while the other represents
the palm spacer. This design helps ensure that the index finger remains in
contact with the flip for any fold DUT geometry.
1 Open the DUT and place it face-up on the alignment Tool B with its hinge
suspended between the two humps. The side of the DUT shall be aligned against
the side wall of the tool. The base of the DUT shall rest on the wide hump
with ruled markings, and the flip of the DUT shall rest on the narrow hump.
2 Tool B has an engraved line on the side wall. Align axis of a fold hinge to
this marking. An open slider should be slide longitudinally until the base
part of the DUT touches the narrow hump of the Tool B.Record the correct
longitudinal position of the bottom of the DUT by reading off the ruler of
Tool B. Visually align the two halves of the split-level ruler to minimize
parallax reading error.
3 Position the DUT in the right-handed or left-handed Fold Hand Phantom,
resting on the index fingertip and palm spacer, with the bottom of the DUT
aligned to the ruling on the right-handed or left-handed palm spacer that
corresponds to the reading from Step 2. Ensure that all fingertips are in
contact with the DUT.
4 While keeping the DUT in the hand phantom in the position defined in
previous steps, place the DUT and the hand phantom against the head phantom in
such way that the DUT is in 6°tilt agnle as descriped in 5.1.6.

Figure 5.1.6.2-1 Aligment Tool B and right-handed fold hand phantom with a
spacer. Use left-handed (mirror-imaged) spacers with left-handed phantoms.
#### 5.1.6.3 PDA
This procedure applies to DUTs that are from 56 to 72 mm wide. To help achieve
a consistent positioning, the DUT is aligned to a PDA palm spacer. No
alignment tool is required. The PDA spacer features side and bottom walls to
ensure consistent alignment of DUTs of various sizes.
1 Place the DUT on the PDA spacer between the fingers and align the DUT to the
side wall of the PDA.
2 If the DUT is shorter than 135 mm, then align the top of the DUT with the
top of the PDA spacer. Otherwise align the bottom of the DUT with the bottom
wall of the PDA spacer.
3 While keeping the DUT in the hand phantom in the position defined in
previous steps, place the DUT and the hand phantom against the head phantom in
such way that the DUT is in 6°tilt agnle as descriped in 5.1.6.

(mirror-imaged) spacers with left-handed phantoms.
### 5.1.7 DUT positioning for browsing mode
Browsing mode is used to simulate user cases were the DUT is held in hand, but
not pressed against ear e.g. web browsing and navigation.The DUT shall be
mounted in a suitable hand phantom and oriented such that the DUT's main
display is tilted 45 degrees from vertical. Devices with a cover piece are
tested cover open.
#### 5.1.7.1 Narrow DUT
This procedure is suitable for use with all DUTs narrower than 56 mm.
Alignment Tool A in figure 5.1.6.2-1 is first used to measure the distance
between the bottom of the DUT and the center of its nav key. The DUT is then
positioned in accordance with ruled markings on a palm spacer to data mode
hand phantom.
1 Place the DUT on the DUT alignment Tool A. Record the chin length from the
scale at the bottom of the alignment tool.
2 Record the location of the navigation key (or the "2" key, if no navigation
key is present) on the side ruler of the DUT alignment tool A. The key\'s
center is used as the reference.
3 Add the two readings from Step 2 and 3 together. If the sum is less than 30
mm, then use 30 mm location on spacer instead.
4 Place the DUT on the right-hand or left-hand narrow data palm spacer and
align the side of the DUT with the side wall of the spacer. The bottom edge of
the DUT shall be placed on the narrow data palm spacer at the ruling
corresponding to the value obtained in Step 4
Make sure that the index finger is in contact with the back of the DUT. If the
device is very narrow and/or thin, it may occur that the middle finger does
not curl tightly enough to contact the DUT. In such case, in order to ensure
consistent test results, no attempt should be made to force the fingertip to
contact the DUT. Touch fastenermaterial may be used to maintain the DUT in the
desired position.

handed (mirror-imaged) spacers with left-handed phantoms
#### 5.1.7.2 PDA
This procedure is suitable for use with DUTs of width 56-72 mm. The
positioning of the DUT in the PDA hand for data mode is identical to that for
speech mode described in 5.1.6.3.
## 5.2 Anechoic chamber constraints
The main objective of this section is to define basic parameters of the
anechoic chamber suited for the Tx and Rx measurement of UMTS mobile handsets.
The chamber should be equipped with an antenna positioner making possible to
perform full 3-D measurements for both Tx and Rx radiated performance. Two
main measurement set-ups are presented for this purpose:
a) A so-called spherical scanner system implies that the DUT is placed on a
positioner that rotates in a horizontal plane. The probe antenna is rotated
physically in the vertical plane. Alternatively multiple probe antennas can be
placed along an arch in vertical plane and electronically switched in order to
get the full 3-D radiation/sensitivity pattern (see Figure 7.1). Alternatively
a multiple probe system, which has a set of probes located on the full
spherical surface, may also be used [26]. In this case the DUT does not have
to be rotated.
b) A so-called dual axis system implies that the DUT is placed on a positioner
that is able to rotate around two different axes. The signal is
transmitted/received by a fixed probe (see Figure 7.2). It is noted that many
conventional two-axis systems (i.e. many commercially available systems built
for a more general use) are built for the support of rather heavy test objects
(with narrow antenna beam), which by their mechanical size may disturb the
measurement of nearly omnidirectional antennas. Note that such systems are
equipped with a positioner that may disturb the measurement of nearly
omnidirectional antennas.
In both cases the measurement antenna should be able to measure two orthogonal
linear polarizations (typically theta (θ) and phi (φ) polarizations).
Note that for an anechoic chamber, horn antennas are usually used as probe
antennas. There are two kinds of horn antennas: single-polarized and dual-
polarized. The dual-polarized horn antenna has advantages of a major
importance in comparison with the single-polarized. In fact, it is possible to
measure two orthogonal polarizations without any movement of the probe, and
this will:
a) Reduce the cable antenna uncertainty contribution
b) Improve the measurement stability
c) Reduce the time delay between the acquisitions of each polarized signal due
to the electrical RF relay.
If using single-polarized probe antenna, it is possible to perform the
measurements by turning one linear polarized antenna by 90 ° for every
measurement point. However, this technique has a major drawback: the cable of
this antenna is subjected to numerous bendings and rotations, which brings
some measurement instabilities. The various positions of the cable have an
effect on the repeatability of measurements, and the stress applied to the
cable can reduce its performance. The use of a \"stress cable\", or a rotary
joint, connected to the main low-loss cable that is connected to the BTS
simulator is recommended if using a single-polarized probe.
### 5.2.1 Quiet zone dimension
Quiet zone has to be large enough to contain DUT attached to a phantom head
and shoulders. The dimensions have to be slightly larger than the phantom
dimension due to the fact that the rotation axes are not passing through the
symmetry plane of the phantom, but through the phase center of the DUT. Thus
minimum radius of the quiet zone has to be 150mm, which is the approximate
distance from a mobile phone to the edge of the head and shoulders phantom
while the phone is placed in an \"intended use\" position.
### 5.2.2 Minimum distance between the DUT and the measurement antenna
For far-field measurements, the distance _r_ between the DUT and the
measurement antenna should be
$r > \text{max}\left( \frac{2D^{2}}{\lambda},3D,3\lambda \right)$ (5.1)
where λ is the largest wavelength within the frequency band of interest and
_D_ the maximum extension of the radiating structure. Then the phase- and
amplitude uncertainty limits and the reactive near field limit are not
exceeded. The influence of measurement distance is discussed in Appendix A -
Estimation of Measurement Uncertainty
### 5.2.3 Reflectivity of the quiet zone
**Reflectivity of the quiet zone must be measured for frequencies used with
method described in Appendix F. Measured reflectivity level is used in
uncertainty calculations.**
### 5.2.4 Shielding effectiveness of the chamber
In order to be able to measure sensitivity all external radiation has to be
eliminated. Depending on the conditions at the test site in question,
different values of shielding effectiveness of the measurement chamber might
be required. The only general requirement on the shielding effectiveness of
the chamber is that the measured level of external signals at the frequency of
interest (UMTS frequency band) has to be 10dB below sensitivity level of the
mobile equipment. See Appendix F for more details on shielding effectiveness
validation.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported.

in thickness. It is recommended, but not required, that a Styrofoam spacer
would be used between the holding fixture and the EUT.
# 6 Measurement parameters
## 6.1 Definition of the Total Radiated Power (TRP)
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the antenna
actually radiates, when non-idealities such as mismatch and losses in the
antenna are taken into account. The TRP is defined as the integral of the
power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
$P_{\text{TRP}} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{}^{}\left(
P_{\text{tx}}G_{\theta}(\Omega;f) + P_{\text{tx}}G_{\phi}(\Omega;f)
\right)d\Omega$ (6.1)
Using $\psi$ to denote either $\theta$ or $\phi$, $G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the
$\psi$-polarization component of the gain pattern for the handset antenna
measured at the frequency $f$, where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing
the direction. $P_{\text{tx}}$is the transmit power level of the handset so
that $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the actually transmitted power-level,
also known as EIRP, in the $\psi$-polarization and in the direction $\Omega$
for frequency $f$.
The above equation may be written in \"gain\" form, that is, the TRP given by
P~TRP~ is normalized to the transmitted power $P_{\text{tx}}$. This is the
total radiation efficiency, which can also be denoted as Total Radiated Power
Gain, TRPG,
$\Gamma_{\text{TRP}} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\oint_{}^{}\left( G_{\theta}(\Omega;f) +
G_{\phi}(\Omega;f) \right)d\Omega$ (6.2)
Expressing the TRP by this form allows a simpler understanding of concept of
the Mean Effective Gain (MEG) that will be introduced below.
In practice discrete samples of $P_{\text{tx}}G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$ are measured
and used to approximate the integral so that the TRP is computed as
$P_{\text{TRP}} \approx \frac{\Delta_{\theta}\Delta_{\phi}}{4\pi}\sum_{n =
0}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}\left\lbrack
P_{\text{tx}}G_{\theta}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f) +
P_{\text{tx}}G_{\phi}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f)
\right\rbrack}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})$ (6.3)
Or, by using the relation $\text{EIRP} = P_{\text{tx}}G$:
$P_{\text{TRP}}(f) \approx \frac{\Delta_{\theta}\Delta_{\phi}}{4\pi}\sum_{n =
0}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}\left\lbrack
\text{EIRP}_{\theta}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f) +
\text{EIRP}_{\phi}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f)
\right\rbrack}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})$ (6.4)
In gain form the TRP can be expressed as:
$\Gamma_{\text{TRP}} \approx \frac{\Delta_{\theta}\Delta_{\phi}}{4\pi}\sum_{n
= 0}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}\left\lbrack
G_{\theta}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f) + G_{\phi}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f)
\right\rbrack}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})$ (6.5)
In these formulas $\Delta_{\theta} = \frac{\pi}{(}N)$ and $\Delta_{\phi} =
2\frac{\pi}{M}$ are the sampling intervals for the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles, respectively, and the number of samples in the $\theta$- and
$\phi$-angles are given by $N$ and $M$, respectively. The sampling points of
the sphere are given by $\theta_{n} = \text{nΔ}_{\theta}$ and $\phi_{m} =
\text{mΔ}_{\phi}$. The sampling intervals are discussed further in Section
6.6.
When measuring power radiated by active devices, expressing the data in terms
of EIRP is more appropriate. The upper form of the TRP formulas (which
includes EIRP terms) will be used in the data processing.
## 6.2 Definition of the Mean Effective Gain (MEG)
The Mean Effective Gain (MEG) is the ratio of the actually received mean power
by a User Equipment/Mobile Station antenna (or the NB/BS by reciprocity) to
the mean power received from two hypothetical isotropic antennas in the same
UE/MS environment and matched to the $\theta$- and $\varphi$-polarizations,
respectively. As detailed in [7]&[8], the MEG may be obtained using a surface
integration,
$\Gamma(f) = \frac{\oint_{}^{}\left( G_{\theta}(\Omega;f)Q_{\theta}(\Omega;f)
+ G_{\phi}(\Omega;f)Q_{\phi}(\Omega;f) \right)d\Omega}{\oint_{}^{}\left(
Q_{\theta}(\Omega;f) + Q_{\phi}(\Omega;f) \right)d\Omega}$ (6.6)
Using$\psi$to denote either$\theta$or$\varphi$, $G_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$is the
$\psi$-polarization component of the gain pattern for the handset antenna
measured at the frequency$f$, where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the
direction.
The term $Q_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$denotes the average power received by the UE/MS
in the direction $\Omega$, in the $\psi$-polarization and for the frequency
$f$, in other words, $Q_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$ is the Power Angular Distribution
(PAD) of the received signal at different Angle of Arrivals/Departures
(AoA/AoD) at the UE/MS. Typically $Q_{\psi}(\Omega;f)$ is a model derived from
measurements. Since the MEG is a ratio of power values only the cross
polarization ratio (XPR) of the channel (observe that this parameter is in
general a function of the carrier frequency, $\text{XPR}(f) =
\oint_{}^{}{Q_{\theta}(\Omega;f)d\Omega}/\oint_{}^{}{Q_{\varphi}(\Omega;f)d\Omega}$)
and the distribution of power versus direction for each frequency is important
in the model. However, in practice the average XPR will remain almost constant
for each frequency band in question.
Note: It should be noticed that in order to arrive to the definition of MEG
given by expression (6.6) it has been assumed that there is no correlation
between two cross-polarized components arriving/departing along the same
direction. Hence, it is assumed that the cross-polarization state of the
channel including the antenna may be obtained by the XPR.
## 6.3 Power angular models and channel XPR
The following are some examples of models that do not include frequency
dependence,
1) HUT: the model is based on numerous measurements in the city of Helsinki,
Finland [27]. This model is uniform versus azimuth angle but non-uniform in
the elevation angle. The XPR for this model is 10.7 dB. The NB/BS antenna was
vertically polarized.
2) AAU: the model is based on numerous outdoor to indoor measurements in the
city of Aalborg, Denmark [28]. This model is non-uniform versus both azimuth
and elevation angle, and has an XPR of 5.5dB. The NB/BS antenna was vertically
polarized.
3) Isotropic: the isotropic model implies equal weighting of power versus
direction in both polarizations and using an XPR of 0 dB. It is important to
notice that if this model is applied, the MEG will always be 3 dB lower than
the TRPG.
The models listed above are examples of existing models. Currently, a spatial
channel model (SCM) has been devised by the combined 3GPP-3GPP2 ad-hoc group
[29]. In that model a Power Angular Distribution at the UE/MS was defined that
is in shape similar to the HUT model.
{width="4.25in" height="3.3868055555555556in"}
Figure 6.1: Angular elevation power density functions (θ-polarisation) of
measured data (urban macrocell), and of Double Exponential and Gaussian
distributions [27].
These are some models for the environment\'s angle of arrival probability
elevation distributions [7] [27] (the angles here are given in degrees):
> 1) Gaussian distribution:
{width="2.7777777777777777in" height="0.4861111111111111in"} (6.7)
> 2) Double Exponential distribution:
$p(\theta) = \left{ \begin{matrix} A_{1}\text{exp}\left( -
\frac{\sqrt{2}\left| \theta - \left( \text{90} - \theta_{0} \right)
\right|}{\sigma_{-}} \right) & \theta \in \left\lbrack 0,\text{90} -
\theta_{0} \right\rbrack \ A_{2}\text{exp}\left( - \frac{\sqrt{2}\left| \theta
- \left( \text{90} - \theta_{0} \right) \right|}{\sigma_{+}} \right) & \theta
\in \left\lbrack \text{90} - \theta_{0},\text{180} \right\rbrack \
\end{matrix} \right.\ $ (6.8)
It should be noted that the MEG depends on the orientation of the handset with
respect to the environment, because neither the PAD nor the antenna gain
pattern are uniform. Both the HUT and AAU models consider this effect because
these models are non-uniform in one or both of the azimuth and elevation
angles. Therefore, the MEG generally needs to be computed for different
handset orientations. In some cases different orientations of the handset may
be obtained numerically from a single measurement, but more than one
measurement of the gain pattern is necessary when the user of the terminal is
included and different relative positions of the terminal next to the user are
considered.
As for the TRP the MEG in practice has to be computed using discrete samples
of the antenna gain patterns using the expression
$\Gamma(f) \approx \frac{\sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}\left\lbrack
G_{\theta}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f)Q_{\theta}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f) +
G_{\phi}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f)Q_{\phi}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f)
\right\rbrack\text{sin}(\theta_{n})}}{\sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M -
1}\left\lbrack Q_{\theta}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f) +
Q_{\phi}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f) \right\rbrack\text{sin}(\theta_{n})}}$ (6.9)
where the sample points of the sphere are given in terms of $\theta_{n} =
\text{nΔ}_{\theta}$ and $\phi_{m} = \text{mΔ}_{\phi}$in which $\Delta_{\theta}
= \frac{\pi}{(}N)$ and $\Delta_{\phi} = 2\frac{\pi}{M}$ are the sampling
intervals for the $\theta$- and $\phi$-angles, respectively.
The number of samples in the $\theta$- and $\phi$-angles are given by _N_ and
_M_ , respectively.
## 6.4 Definition of Mean Effective Radiated Power (MERP)
When the MEG formula is applied to the active mobile terminals, it is
convenient to modify the expression (6.6) to include the EIRP rather than just
gain. This is done by introducing the definition of Mean Effective Radiated
Power (MERP). In MERP we substitute the gain with EIRP. Note that due to the
reciprocity, we can apply the MEG/MERP concept in both the downlink and uplink
cases.
## 6.5 Definition of Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS)
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
$\text{TRS} = \frac{4\pi}{\oint_{}^{}\left\lbrack
\frac{1}{\text{EIS}_{\theta}(\Omega;f)} +
\frac{1}{\text{EIS}_{\phi}(\Omega;f)} \right\rbrack d\Omega}$ (6.10)
where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization.
## 6.6 Definition of Mean Effective Radiated Sensitivity (MERS)
The MEG formula (or more correctly the MERP) can be applied to the sensitivity
measurements of active mobile terminals by modifying the formula into
following form, which we call as Mean Effective Radiated Sensitivity, [30]:
$\text{MERS} = \frac{\oint_{}^{}{\left\lbrack Q_{\theta}\left( \Omega,f
\right) + Q_{\varphi}\left( \Omega,f \right) \right\rbrack
d\Omega}}{\oint_{}^{}{\left\lbrack \frac{Q_{\theta}\left( \Omega,f
\right)}{\text{EIS}_{\theta}(\Omega,f)} + \frac{Q_{\varphi}\left( \Omega,f
\right)}{\text{EIS}_{\varphi}(\Omega,f)} \right\rbrack d\Omega}}$ (6.11)
As in the case of MEG/MERP, MERS needs the antenna pattern measurements to be
performed before its value can be determined.
Note: At this stage the interrelation between the TRP and MERP as well as the
impact of the channel XPR on the antenna performance have been addressed (see
[31], [32], [33] for reference). However, this topic needs further
investigation in order to be included in a future stage.
Note: The impact of the MS/UE antenna performance on the UMTS capacity and and
coverage in the downlink have been addressed in [34], [35].
## 6.7 Sampling grid
There is a trade-off between the accuracy of the approximated TRP, MEG/MERP,
TRS and MERS values and the total measurement time required to obtain a
complete 3-D gain pattern of the antenna. It is important to limit the total
measurement time since the handsets must be battery powered during the
measurements.
Generally it can be said that since the radiating object has a limited size
the gain pattern cannot change arbitrarily versus angle, and therefore only a
limited number of samples are required to represent the gain pattern to a
given accuracy. Furthermore, it can be expected that the sampling density can
be smaller for integral parameters (TRP, MEG/MERP, TRS and MERS) computations
compared to what is required to represent the gain pattern, since the TRP/MEG
are computed using an integration of the gain pattern. On the other hand it is
expected that the obtained accuracy will strongly depend on the APD model used
in the computation of MEG/MERP.
In [36] typical error values have been calculated from practical gain pattern
measurements of different mobile handsets using different sampling densities.
A related study is presented in [37]. It is concluded that a 15°-sample grid
in both azimuth and elevation is sufficient for accurate measurements.
Alternatively, different sampling patterns can be used, if they can provide
benefit in terms of measurement time. For example, sampling the sphere on a
continuous spiral trajectory with constant speed of rotation in elevation and
azimuth can be a very convenient option for TRP measurements. Since the
rotation around both axes is continuous, the total time required by the
measurement can be significantly shorter than for a regular sampling grid. The
continuous movement does not introduce a significant error provided that the
transmitted power for each angle is recorded on a time scale much shorter than
the angular variation. The TRP can be calculated by interpolating the values
on the spiral trajectory to points on the regular grid or by using an
alternative quadrature formula. As first order approximation the simple
summation over the measurement points is adequate. It is convenient, in
practice, to synchronize the azimuth and elevation rotation speed so that the
DUT makes an integer number of complete revolutions, while the elevation
changes from 0° to 180°. The number of complete revolutions defines the
sampling interval in elevation and the overall number of measurements points.
## 6.8 Measurement frequencies
The radiation patterns of handset antennas can be expected to be frequency
dependent, both in the maximum level and, to smaller extent, in the shape of
the pattern. This is due mainly to the antenna matching circuits, which are
typically frequency selective. The radiating current on the antenna itself
will to some degree depend on the frequency. Given this, the TRP, MEG/MERP,
TRS and MERS should be evaluated at all relevant frequencies, which, in
principle, would require measurements of the spherical radiation patterns for
each of those frequencies. However, due to practical reasons, such exhaustive
measurements are not realizable. As a consequence, a few most relevant
frequency points shall be selected in each considered band.
As reported in [38] measurements have been performed at the center and at the
two edge channels of the GSM-1800 band for five different types of handsets.
It was found that the TRP for the edge channels differed up to 1.1 dB from the
TRP of the center channel. Accordingly, the maximum deviation for the obtained
MEG values was up to 1.7 dB. This shows that the TRP and MEG values obtained
from a single-frequency gain pattern measurement of an antenna may lead to
unacceptable high errors at other frequencies within the band, if one
extrapolates those results to the TRP at other frequencies. Hence, the gain
pattern must to be measured at more than one channel.
For practical purposes, 3 channels Tx and 3 channels Rx per band are used in
the measurements, i.e.:low, mid and high channels.
# **7 Measurement procedure -- transmitter performance**
This section describes the specifics of the radiated power measurement
procedure.
## 7.1 General measurement arrangements
A radio communications tester or a corresponding device is used as a NB/BS
simulator to setup calls to the DUT. The NB/BS simulator may also measure the
radiated power samples. Alternatively, a measurement receiver or spectrum
analyzer may be used for that purpose. See Chapter 9 and Appendix D for a more
detailed description of the NB/BS simulator or spectrum analyzer in UMTS and
2G systems.
The measurements are performed so that the DUT is placed against a SAM
phantom. The characteristics of the SAM phantom are specified in Section 2\.
The measurement of the DUT is performed both on the left and right ears of the
SAM phantom. The center of the rotation should be at the ear reference point
of the SAM head.
The measurements will be performed for the different antenna configurations of
the DUT. For example in the case of a retractable antenna, for both antenna
extended and retracted configurations. In future, more specific test
configurations for each major type of terminals may be added in this part.
## 7.2 Procedure for spherical scanning ranges
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the Device Under Test (DUT). The power radiated by the
DUT is sampled in far field in a group of points located on a spherical
surface enclosing the DUT. The samples are taken using a constant sample step
of 15° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different
sampling grid can be used to speed up the measurements (See Section 6.6). All
the samples are taken with two orthogonal linear polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations. It is also possible to measure some other polarisation
components, if it is possible to recover $\theta$- and $\phi$-polarisations
from the measured data by some technique. The TRP, TRS, MEG/MERP and MERS are
calculated from the measured data by integration (see definitions from Chapter
6).
In the measurement the DUT is located in the center of the spherical surface.
Examples of antenna pattern measurement systems are presented in Figure 7.1
and 7.2.
One of the most common systems is the dual-axis positioner system, which is
also known as a roll-over azimuth positioner. In this system the DUT is
rotated around two axes and the probe antenna that measures the samples of the
power radiated by the DUT, remains fixed. In the transmitter case, the probe
antenna measures the power radiated by the DUT sampled at different angles. In
the receiver case, the probe antenna measure angular samples of the dedicated
channel signal containing the information needed by the NB/BS simulator to
extract the DUT receiver performances. Typically, in the dual-axes positioner
system, the DUT is rotated to a given azimuthal angle position. For this
angle, the DUT is then rotated in the elevation plane, thus giving a complete
measurement in constant plane. Then the DUT is moved to the next azimuthal
angle, and so on.
In spherical scanning systems the DUT is rotated in azimuthal plane and the
probe antenna is moved in semicircular (or almost a fully circular)
trajectory. The probe moves on an arch, or is moved by a rotating arm on the
trajectory. The spherical scanning system can also be based on multiple
probes, in which case the scanning in elevation direction is performed
electrically. A multi-probe system having a number of probes on the full
spherical surface can also be used, in which case the DUT can remain
stationary [26]. Typically in the spherical scanning system the probe antenna
is moved to fixed elevation angle position, in which the DUT is rotated in the
azimuthal plane. Then the probe antenna is moved to the next elevation angle,
in which the rotation of the DUT in azimuth plane is repeated, and so on.
In both systems, it is possible to use a dual-polarised probe antenna or a
single polarised probe antenna rotated by a polarisation positioner. The
measurement system may use a dual-polarised probe antenna for taking the data
with two polarizations, or the system may use a polarisation positioner. The
systems and rotation sequences shown are examples of existing systems. Other
rotation schemes and positioner are as well acceptable, as long as they
produce the far field radiation pattern data with similar properties as the
systems presented here. In all cases the data is post-processed by a similar
calculation method. The standard spherical coordinate system used in the
presentation of the radiation patterns is shown in Figure 7.3.

## 7.3 Calibration measurement
The relative power data values of the measurement points will be transformed
to absolute radiated power values (in dBm) by performing a calibration
measurement using a reference antenna with known gain or efficiency values.
The reference antenna is also called as the calibration antenna. The
calibration method used here is based on so-called gain-comparison (gain-
transfer) method, [39]. In the calibration measurement the reference antenna
is measured in the same place as the DUT, and the attenuation of the complete
transmission path from the DUT to the measurement receiver/NB/BS simulator is
calibrated out. The gain and/or radiation efficiency of the reference antenna
must be known at the frequency bands in which the calibrations are performed.
Recommended calibration antennas are monopole antennas or sleeve dipoles tuned
for the each frequency band of interest [40] [41]. A network analyzer or
spectrum analyzer can be used to perform the calibration measurement. The
network analyzer method is recommended. The calibration is performed
individually for the both orthogonal polarizations used in the testing of the
devices under test.
In the calibration procedure, a substitution method is used, allowing
determining the Normalized Site Attenuation (NSA) at frequencies of interest.
The principle is based on the use of calibration/substitution antennas (see
the latter part of this section for more details about this kind of antennas)
presenting a gain known with a sufficient accuracy in the measurement
bandwidths. Such a substitution antenna is placed on the MS positioner at the
exact MS location used for TRP, MEG/MERP, TRS and MERS measurement. It is
possible to use a mechanical piece to place the substitution antenna on the
positioner. This mechanical piece should not present any electromagnetic
properties, which could influence the frequency response and the radiation
properties of the substitution antenna. Note that usually two kinds of
calibrated substitution antennas have to be considered to measure the vertical
and horizontal polarization NSAs.
Find hereafter, an illustration of the substitution configuration in Figure
7.4.
{width="6.511805555555555in" height="3.615972222222222in"}
Figure 7.4 Illustration of the calibration/substitution procedure.
An RF power generator drives a continuous wave (CW) signal to the calibrated
substitution antenna.
After having measured cable losses from A to C and thanks to the data sheet of
the calibrated substitution antenna, it is possible to determine the power
radiated in the plane P, with a known and sufficiently low uncertainty.
The cable AC connecting the substitution antenna to the RF power generator
should be such that its influence upon radiation pattern measurements is
negligible.
NSA is the attenuation between P and B (red curve of Figure 7.4).
The power generator is tuned to a reference output RF level. The measured
power on the spectrum analyzer allows deducing the NSA.
Note that it is important to check the RF generator power level with the
spectrum analyser, to avoid any power level differences between measurement
devices. To do so, a calibrated cable is necessary (c1).
This procedure has to be done at each frequency of interest.
To achieve measurements with an uncertainty as low as possible, it is
absolutely necessary to exactly keep the same P to B configuration (cables,
dual-polarized antenna and cables positions, etc).
In the case of TRP, TRS, MEG/MERP and MERS measurements using a radio
communication tester, connection B has to be connected to a BS simulator.
Find hereunder the formula that allows to define the NSA:
$\text{NSA} = \left( P_{\text{RFgen}} - L_{\text{AC}} +
G_{\text{substitution}} \right) - P_{\text{SA}} + \text{δc}1(\text{dB})$ (7.1)
where expressed in dB, NSA is the Normalized Site Attenuation, P~Rfgen~ is the
power delivered by the RF generator, L~AC~ denotes the losses in the emission
cable (AC), G~substitution~ is the gain of the calibrated substitution
antenna, P~SA~ is the power measured by the spectrum analyzer (B) and δc1 is
the delta between reference levels of the RF generator and the spectrum
analyzer.
The NSA measurement is affected by an uncertainty defined in Appendix A. Note
that, between two successive NSA procedures, it is very important to check if
the difference between the new NSA and the old one does not exceed the
uncertainty value. If this difference is within the uncertainty scale, the
first NSA measurement should be kept, otherwise the uncertainty scale would be
increased. If this difference is out of the uncertainty scale, the site has
been modified. In such a case, one should analyze what has been changed in the
site and tune the NSA, if necessary. Another method to determine the NSA could
be implemented as shown in Figure 7.5.
{width="6.528472222222222in" height="3.104861111111111in"}
Figure 7.5 Calibration/substitution procedures using a vector network
analyzer.
The procedure is exactly the same but the use of a unique measurement device
(network analyzer) for the transmission and reception avoids the measurement
of δc1.
Note that the calibration procedure was described for a system using a
spectrum analyzer as the receiver in the DUT measurements. The same
calibration procedure is applicable also for the systems using a radio
communications tester as the receiver. In that case the Rx-port corresponds to
the input port of the spectrum analyzer in Figures 7.4 and 7.5.
For spherical scanning systems, where the probe antenna is rotated in the
vertical plane, it can be convenient to perform the NSA calibration, by using
the reference antenna efficiency $\eta_{\text{substitution}}$, rather than its
peak gain [40]. In this case a full spherical scanning is performed with the
reference antenna on the positioner. The average received power at the
spectrum analyzer is calculated by using the standard summation formula
described in section 6.1:
$P_{\text{Average}}^{\text{SA}} \approx \frac{1}{N\ M}\sum_{n = 0}^{N -
1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}\left\lbrack
P_{\theta}^{\text{SA}}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m}) +
P_{\phi}^{\text{SA}}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m};f)
\right\rbrack}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})$ (7.2)
$\text{NSA} = \left( P_{\text{RFgen}} - L_{\text{AC}} +
\eta_{\text{substitution}} \right) - P_{\text{Average}}^{\text{SA}} +
\text{δc}1(\text{dB})$ (7.3)
This calibration procedure has the advantage than the NSA is averaged on all
the probe antenna positions.
The calibration is a highly time-consuming process. A reference UE can be a
solution to rapidly verify that the calibration of the site does not deviate
too much. It is very important to fully characterize the reference UE just
after a full calibration procedure.
## 7.3 Reference antennas
**Low gain reference antennas**
Half-wave dipole antennas are widely used as reference antennas for
measurement/calibration of antennas and test ranges for low gain antenna
measurements. An example of reference sleeve dipole is shown in Figure 7.6.
The design is based on low loss end-fed sleeve dipole technology minimizing
cable and feed point interaction. The design includes a choke, which further
reduces cable interaction by attenuating the natural return currents from the
dipole [41].
Half-wave dipole is relatively narrow band antenna with roughly 10% bandwidth
and very high efficiency \~ 95%. A very high degree of azimuth pattern
symmetry can be obtained with high precision machining of the dipole
components [41]. The dipole performance can be relatively easily estimated
using theoretical formulas although these formulas are unable to predict the
impact of the choke. Therefore, accurate pre-calibration of the reference
sleeve dipoles in a laboratory specialized in high accuracy antenna
calibrations is recommended.
A carefully designed and constructed sleeve dipole is a good choice as the
reference antenna for the calibration procedure of 3G UE performance
measurements. The relative bandwidth of UMTS systems is 12 % (1920 to 2170
MHz). One calibrated sleeve dipole can approximately cover the whole UMTS
band. However, different sleeve dipoles are needed for dual-system terminals
(UMTS and GSM), for e.g. GSM900 and GSM1800 bands, thus, a set of calibrated
sleeve dipoles may be needed.

height="1.9680555555555554in"}
Figure 7.6 Examples of reference sleeve dipoles [41].
In the proposed test procedure in this document, DUT measurements are needed
with two orthogonal polarizations. Consequently, calibration measurement and
antenna is needed for both of these two orthogonal polarizations. The magnetic
dipole or magnetic loop antenna shown in Figure 7.7 is often used to
complement the electrical dipole. The radiation pattern of the magnetic dipole
is very similar to the electrical dipole but in orthogonal polarisation. The
antenna consists of a planar structure generating a loop of current fed by a
coaxial cable from below. The cable is orthogonal to the polarisation so any
interaction between the two will generate cross-polar radiation. The design
includes a choke, which further reduces cable interaction by attenuating the
natural return currents from the magnetic dipole.
The magnetic dipole is also relatively narrow band antenna with roughly 10%
bandwidth and very high efficiency \~ 95%. A very high degree of azimuth
pattern symmetry can be obtained with a careful design and high precision
machining of the antenna components. As in the case of electrical dipole,
theoretical formulas can be used to predict the performance but the impact of
the choke has to be experimentally checked. Accurate calibration of the
magnetic loop antenna in a high-accuracy antenna calibration laboratory is
recommended.

# **8 Measurement procedure -- receiver performance**
This section describes the specifics of the radiated sensitivity measurement
procedure.
The procedure for the measurement of the UE receiver performance is in
principle equivalent to the transmitter performance measurement described in
Chapter 7. The basic difference is that now the absolute sensitivity value at
a predefined BER level is the parameter of interest in each measurement point.
Note that the receiver and transmitter performances measurements can be done
in parallel, at each position.
## 8.1 General measurement arrangements
A radio communications tester or a corresponding device is used as a NB/BS
simulator to setup calls to the DUT. The NB/BS simulator is also used to send
test signals to the UE and measure the BER levels of the radio link and the
information on the dedicated channel needed to extract the DUT receiver
performances. See Appendices C and D for the UE receiver sensitivity
measurement considerations in UMTS and GSM systems respectively.
The measurements are performed so that the DUT is placed against a SAM
phantom. The characteristics of the SAM phantom and positioning details are
provided in Section 5. The measurement is performed both on the left and right
ears of the SAM phantom. The center of the rotation should be at the ear
reference point of the SAM head.
The measurements will be performed for the different antenna configurations of
the DUT. For example in the case of a retractable antenna, for both antenna
extended and retracted configurations.
## 8.2 Procedure for spherical scanning ranges
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the Device Under Test (DUT). The sensitivity values of
the DUT at a predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of
points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The samples are taken
using a constant sample step of 30 °, or smaller, both in theta (θ) and phi
(φ) directions. All the samples are taken with two orthogonal linear
polarizations, $\theta$- and $\phi$-polarisations. It is also possible to
measure some other polarisation components, if it is possible to recover
$\theta$- and $\phi$-polarisations from the measured data by some technique.
The Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) and Mean Effective Sensitivity (MERS) are
calculated from the measured data by integration (see definitions from Chapter
6).
See Chapter 7 for the examples of antenna pattern measurement systems and the
definition of the coordinate system.
For DUTs with more than one antenna port, all the tests should be performed
using both (all) antennas simultaneously.
## 8.3 Calibration measurement
The relative receiver sensitivity values at the measurement points will be
transformed to absolute sensitivity values (in dBm) by performing a
calibration measurement using a reference antenna with known gain or
efficiency values. In the calibration measurement the reference antenna is
measured in the same place as the DUT, and the attenuation from the whole path
from the DUT to the measurement receiver/NB/BS simulator is calibrated out.
The gain and/or radiation efficiency of the reference antenna must be known at
the frequency bands in which the calibrations are performed. Recommended
calibration antennas are monopole antennas or sleeve dipoles tuned for the
each frequency band of interest [40] [41], see the previous Chapter. A network
analyzer is recommended for the calibration measurement. The calibration is
performed individually for the both two orthogonal polarizations used in the
testing of the devices under test.
The calibration procedure for the receiver measurement (downlink) is in
principle the same as for the transmitter (uplink) measurement. Note, however,
that in UMTS systems the downlink measurement has different frequency band
than the uplink. Moreover, in uplink measurement the attenuation path, which
needs to be calibrated out, is from the location of the DUT to Rx-port of the
radio communications tester (or a spectrum analyzer, if used), whereas in the
downlink measurement the unknown attenuation path is from the DUT location to
Tx-port of the radio communications tester. This consequently means that the
uplink calibration data is not applicable for the downlink measurement but a
separate calibration is needed.
# 9 Radiated power and sensitivity measurement techniques in UMTS system
This section presents technical details and examples on how to carry out the
TRP (uplink) and TRS (downlink) measurement of the UMTS terminal with a radio
communications tester. Appendix D presents details for TRP and TRS measurement
procedure for 2G (GSM) mode of the terminal and related information can be
found in references [42] and [43].
Some background information on the RF and frequency spectrum properties of
UMTS system is presented first.
## 9.1 Technical background information
In the WCDMA system there are two operation modes called FDD (Frequency
Division Duplex) and TDD (Time Division Duplex) [44]. The FDD mode is
considered in this document. Data are transmitted simultaneously in uplink and
downlink to/from different users at a given frequency.
WCDMA FDD mode is designed to operate with 190MHz Tx-Rx frequency separation,
and operates in Europe in the following paired bands:
1920 -- 1980 MHz: Up-link (UE transmits)\ 2110 -- 2170 MHz: Down-link (Node B
transmits)
The channel separation is 200 kHz, which means that the center frequency is an
integer multiple of 200 kHz. In FDD mode the lowest RF uplink channel is 9612,
which is equivalent to 1922.4 MHz. The middle RF uplink channel is 9750 (1950
MHz) and the highest RF uplink channel is 9888 (1977.6 MHz). The nominal
frequency allocation for a single 3GPP WCDMA FDD channel is 5 MHz. The
effective bandwidth for WCDMA is 3.84 MHz and with guard bands, the required
bandwidth is 5 MHz.
Table 9.1 shows the UE power classes according to 3GPP TS25.101 specification
[45], but normally the only power classes in use are 3 (high power data
terminal including antenna gain 2dBi) and 4 (speech terminal) in the user
equipment.
Table 9.1: UE power classes according to 3GPP TS25.101, [45].
+-------------+-----------------+-----------+ | Power Class | Nominal maximum | Tolerance | | | | | | | output power | | +-------------+-----------------+-----------+ | 1 | +33 dBm | +1/-3 dB | +-------------+-----------------+-----------+ | 2 | +27 dBm | +1/-3 dB | +-------------+-----------------+-----------+ | 3 | +24 dBm | +1/-3 dB | +-------------+-----------------+-----------+ | 4 | +21 dBm | ± 2 dB | +-------------+-----------------+-----------+
The UE transmitter has the capability of changing the output power with a step
size of 1, 2 and 3 dB.
### 9.1.1 The common test setup for TRP and TRS testing
Common settings for TRP and TRS measurements are needed to enable simultaneous
measurement of TRP & TRS:
\- Power control algorithm 2
\- More stable output power
\- As the TRS is tested at the same time with TRP there will be errors in
received power control commands during the test. With PCA2 the impact of
random PC errors to the UE output power can be minimized.
\- UE output power must be set to the maximum level during TRS test as in
25.101 sensitivity test case
\- Compressed mode OFF
\- Transmission gaps disabled
\- Test loop mode 2
\- To enable TRS measurement
\- In test loop mode 2 both the received bits and the CRC are looped back to
Node B simulator
\- Data pattern PN15
## 9.2 TRP measurement
Radio communications tester with WCDMA FDD option is used in the measurements
to simulate a base station (BS) (also called as Node B in UMTS system) for
establishing and maintaining the calls. The BS simulator is also used for
controlling the transmit power level of the mobile phones. Examples of such
tester are R&S CMU200, AGILENT 8960 or ANRITSU.
The test procedure is based on a connection between the tester and the DUT on
a Reference Measurement Channel (RMC) specified in [45]. In the RMC it is
possible to carry out BER tests as well as measure the received power at the
UE (so-called CPICH RSCP for Common Pilot Channel Received Signal Code Power).
The RMC permits also to vary the bit rate of the connection from 12.2 kbps to
384 kbps with symmetric or asymmetric traffic depending on the terminal
capability. The presented test procedure is based on 12.2 kbps data rate. A
higher data rate may be used in future along with the further development of
the test procedure.
The uplink measurement (TRP) algorithm measures the instantaneous maximum
power by sending constant \'power up command\' to the terminal. The mobile
phone is commanded to transmit at full power so that output power variations
due to the close loop power control are then avoided.
Figure 9.1 shows an example test set-up for UMTS measurements. The filters are
needed in the test set-up in order to avoid the coupling effects between the
signals in the power splitter. Different filtered physical paths are shown in
Figure 9.1. Using the same port for input and output on the communication
tester has been discarded due to hardware restriction; indeed, the
communication tester sensitivity on dual way port is much lower than single
way port sensitivity. This is a typical problem of many existing BS
simulators, which are still currently under development. Figure 9.1 represents
a measurement set-up taking those problems into account. Splitter and filters
will eventually be suppressed when it is possible to work only with one port
of the BS simulator.
Note: for practical reasons it may be most efficient to build a set-up that
allows performing both 3G and 2G UE testing.

Figure 9.1 Example UMTS measurement set-up. The RS CMU 200 should be replaced
by BS/NB simulator.
The measurement is first initialised so that the mobile terminal is
synchronised and registered with the pseudo-network emulated by the radio
communications tester. To do that, signal from the Node B simulator is
activated and an operator switches on the phone (in the anechoic room) so that
the DUT will synchronise on start up. It is also possible to wait for a period
of time if the mobile phone is already switched on, so it will synchronise
itself. The mobile terminal is then fixed in the measurement position (in free
space or beside the phantom). Since the established connection is a RMC, there
is no need of answering a phone call (i.e. unlike in GSM).
During the measurement the mobile terminal is controlled to transmit with full
power. For all points on a spherical surface surrounding the mobile phone, the
uplink received power is measured by the base station simulator. The base
station simulator itself (Node B) should transmit at sufficiently high power
level (e.g. 0 dBm) to ensure error-free connection in downlink.
## 9.3 TRS measurement
The TRS measurement is initialized in the same way as the TRP measurement: the
mobile terminal is synchronised and registered with the pseudo-network
emulated by the radio communications tester.
The downlink algorithm (TRS) bases its measurement on BER measurements. The
aim is to determine the needed received power at UE (so-called target power or
Ptarget) to achieve the BER target (e.g. 1%).
**Full TRS measurement:**
Sensitivity level is measured using 12.2kbps DL (and UL) reference channel for
every position and polarization of the phone by sweeping the power transmitted
by system simulator until the BER reaches target value of 1.0% ± 0.2% using at
least 20000 bits.
In order to speed up the measurement the DL and UL bit rate can be increased
to maximum supported by the UE. When higher than 12.2kbps data rate is used
also the BER target can be changed to 10.0% ± 2.0% using at least 20000 bits.
If modified bit rate or BER target is used the effect of this modification
($\Delta\text{Sen}$) must be measured at least in 4 different positions for
each measured frequency (low, mid high). Reference sensitivity measurements
must be done in a sequential order for each position.
The sensitivity level with faster method is done similarly as the full TRS
measurement with 12.2kbps reference channel. The sensitivity level is measured
with higher data rate and BER target for every position and polarization of
the phone by sweeping the power transmitted by system simulator until the BER
reaches target value. In addition to the higher data rate measurement the
sensitivity level with 12.2kbps DL reference channel needs to be measured as
in standard method in positions that are used in definition of the correction
factor $\Delta\text{Sen}$.
Assuming $\Delta\text{Sen}_{\text{fa},\text{pb}}$ is difference in sensitivity
(in dBs) between 12.2kbps DL reference channel (1.0% ± 0.2% BER using at least
20000 bits) and higher data rate DL channel with higher BER target measured at
frequency a and position b. $\Delta\overline{\text{Sen}}$ for frequency a is
then dB average of measured $\Delta\text{Sen}_{\text{fa},\text{pb}}$s where b=
1...b~max~ and b~max~≥4.
At the end of the test sequence $\Delta\overline{\text{Sen}}$for each measured
frequency must be added to the measured higher data rate sensitivity level to
get the corresponding 12.2kbps 1% sensitivity level.
For DUTs with more than one antenna port, all the tests should be performed
using both (all) antennas simultaneously.
## 9.4 Calibration of absolute levels
In the calibration process, the measurement system\'s power levels are
calibrated using a reference antenna with known gain at European 3G frequency
band (1920 - 2170MHz). One technique is to feed the reference antenna from the
RF output port of an applicable 3G UE and the maximum received power at the
communication tester is recorded. See more details on the calibration
measurement from Chapter 8 and Appendix F.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Estimation of measurement uncertainty
Individual uncertainty contributions in the TRP and TRS measurements are
discussed and evaluated in this Appendix. A technique for calculating the
total measurement uncertainty is also presented. More detailed discussion on
the uncertainty contributions can be found from [48] [49].
An important part of a standard measurement procedure is the identification of
uncertainty sources and the evaluation of the overall measurement uncertainty.
There are various individual uncertainty sources in the measurement procedure
that introduce a certain uncertainty contribution to the final measurement
result. The approach in this standard test procedure is that the test
laboratories are not limited to using some specific instruments and antenna
positioners, for example. However, a limit is set for the maximum overall
measurement uncertainty.
The TRP/TRS measurement procedure can be considered to include two stages. In
Stage 1 the actual measurement of the 3-D pattern of the Device Under Test
(DUT) is performed. In Stage 2 the calibration of the absolute level of the
DUT measurement results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna
whose absolute gain/radiation efficiency is known at the frequencies of
interest. The uncertainty contributions related to TRP are listed in Table A.1
and the contributions related to TRS are in Table A.2. The uncertainty
contributions are analyzed in the following paragraphs.
The calculation of the uncertainty contribution is based on the ISO Guide to
the expression of uncertainty in measurement [50] [51] [52] [53]. Each
individual uncertainty is expressed by its Standard Deviation (termed here as
\'standard uncertainty\') and represented by symbol U. The uncertainty
contributions can be classified to two categories: Type-A uncertainties, which
are statistically determined e.g. by repeated measurements, and Type-B
uncertainties, which are derived from existing data e.g. data sheets. Several
individual uncertainties are common in Stage 1 and Stage 2 and therefore
cancel [48] [49].
The procedure of forming the uncertainty budget in TRP measurement is [48]
[49]:
1) Compile lists of individual uncertainty contributions for TRP measurement
both in Stage 1 and Stage 2.
2) Determine the standard uncertainty of each contribution by
a) Determining the distribution of the uncertainty (Gaussian, U-shaped,
rectangular, etc.)
b) Determining the maximum value of each uncertainty (unless the distributions
is Gaussian)
c) Calculating the standard uncertainty by dividing the uncertainty by
{width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} if the
distribution is U-shaped, and by {width="0.25in" height="0.25in"} if the
distribution is rectangular.
3) Convert the units into decibel, if necessary.
4) Combine all the standard uncertainties by the Root of the Sum of the
Squares (RSS) method.
5) Combine the total uncertainties in Stage 1 and Stage 2 also by the RSS
method: {width="2.5833333333333335in" height="0.2916666666666667in"}.
6) Multiply the result by an expansion factor of 1.96 to derive expanded
uncertainty at 95% confidence level: 1.96 * {width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}.
Example uncertainty budgets are presented in Tables A.5, A.6, A.7 and A.8.

# A.1 Mismatch uncertainty between measurement receiver and the probe antenna
If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the probe
antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and determined by the following method.
In a measurement configuration, when two elements (devices, networks...) are
connected, if the matching is not ideal, there is an uncertainty in the RF
level signal passing through the connection. The magnitude of the uncertainty
depends on the VSWR at the junction of the two connectors. In practical
measurement system there are probably several connections in a test set-up,
they will all interact and contribute to the combined mismatch uncertainty.
The total combined mismatch uncertainty is composed of 2 parts:
1) The mismatch through the connector between two elements
2) The mismatch due to the interaction between two elements
## A.1.1 Total combined mismatch uncertainty calculations
### A.1.1.1 Mismatch uncertainty through the connector between two elements:
Hereunder, a measurement configuration:
{width="5.290972222222222in" height="0.5097222222222222in"}
Figure A.1
Г ~MR~ is the complex reflection coefficient of the Measurement Receiver
Г ~cable4~ is the complex reflection coefficient of the cable4
S~21~ is the forward gain in the network between the two reflection
coefficients of interest
S~12~ is the backward gain in the network between the two reflection
coefficients of interest
Note that S~21~ and S~12~ are set to1 if the two parts are directly connected.
The uncertainty limits of the mismatch are calculated by means of the
following formula table 1 of [56]:
Mismatch limits(% voltage) =$\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times
\left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}$
These mismatch limits are divided by $\sqrt{2}$ because of the U-shaped (table
1 of) [56] distribution of the mismatch uncertainty and give the following
standard uncertainty:
U~mismatch~ (% voltage) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times
\left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right|
\times \left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2}}$
To convert this standard uncertainty in dB, we divide it by the standard
uncertainty conversion factor (table 1 of) [56]:
U~mismatch~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times
\left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
### A.1.1.2 Mismatch uncertainty due to the interaction of several elements:
Previously, we presented how to determine the mismatch uncertainty between two
elements through the junction (connector). Now, we introduce the other type of
mismatch uncertainty, which is a result of the interaction between several
elements.
Hereunder, a measurement configuration:
{width="6.065277777777778in" height="0.7493055555555556in"}
Figure A.2
Firstly, we determine the mismatch uncertainty between junctions of the
elements:
Between the MR and the cable3:
U~mismatch1~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}3} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times
\left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the cable3 and the cable4:
U~mismatch2~(dB) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}3} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times
\left| S_{\text{12}} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
\|S~21~\| and \|S~12~\| are set to 1 because there is no element between
cable3 and cable 4.
U~mismatch1~(dB) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}3} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
U~mismatch2~(dB) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}3} \right| \times \left|
\Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
Each mismatch uncertainty due to the interaction between the measurement
receiver and the cable4 is determined by means of the following formula (table
1 of) [56]:
_U~mismatch_interaction1~_(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right|
\times \left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{Cable}3} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}\text{Cable}3}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
\|S~21~\| and \|S~12~\| are equal and correspond to the cable3 attenuation.
U~mismatch_interaction1~(dB) = $\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times
\left| \Gamma_{\text{cable}4} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}\text{Cable}3}
\right|^{2} \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
We consider in the general case, the following measurement configuration:
{width="6.303472222222222in" height="0.7395833333333334in"}
Figure A.3
In the general case, this uncertainty contribution can be calculated by:
U~mismatch_interaction_N~(dB)=$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times
\left| \Gamma_{\text{antenna}} \right| \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{cable}1} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}\text{cable}1}
\right| \times \text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.} \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{cableN}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}\text{cableN}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
\|S~21~\|=\|S~12~\| for passive elements (cables...)
U~mismatch_interaction_N~(dB)=$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{MR}} \right| \times
\left| \Gamma_{\text{antenna}} \right| \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{cable}1} \right|^{2} \times
\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.} \times \left|
S_{\text{21}\text{cableN}} \right|^{2} \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times
\text{11}\text{.}5}$
## A.1.2 Total combined mismatch uncertainty:
The two kinds of mismatch uncertainty contributions are combined by the root-
sum-squares (RSS) method to derive [the total combined mismatch
uncertainty]{.underline}.
The total combined mismatch uncertainty is equal to:
$\sqrt{U_{\text{mismatch}1(\text{dB})} + \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} +
U_{\text{mismatchN}(\text{dB})} +
U_{\text{mismatch}_{\text{interaction}}1(\text{dB})} +
\text{.}\text{.}\text{.} +
U_{\text{mismatch}_{\text{interaction}}N(\text{dB})}}$
This formula shows that the uncertainty is frequency dependent by the way of
the forward and the backward gains in the network between the two components.
The uncertainty upon \|S~21~\| and \|S~12~\| increases with frequency. One can
therefore expect for the UMTS band a higher mismatch uncertainty value than in
the GSM and DCS bands.
Note that for an anechoic chamber, horn antennas are usually used as probe
antennas. There are two kinds of horn antennas: single-polarized and dual-
polarized. With the second one, it is possible to measure the co-polarized and
cross-polarized signals without any movement of the probe, which reduces the
cable antenna uncertainty contribution and improves the measurement stability.
To conduct the signals to the measurement receiver, the measurement system
configuration using a dual-polarized horn antenna has to be completed with an
RF Relay. This device will include new mismatch uncertainty contributions,
which have to be determined with the previously presented calculation methods,
completed by the RF relay parameters contributions, and described in the
following.
# A.2 Mismatch uncertainty of the RF relay
If the same receiver chain configuration (including the measurement receiver;
the probe antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty
is considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and determined by the following method.
The following figure describes the RF Relay with its \'S\' parameters and the
complex reflection coefficient of the inputs and output:
{width="5.156944444444444in" height="3.5833333333333335in"}
Figure A.4
The RF relay is used to switchover the cross and direct polarization signals
from the probe antenna. To determine RF Relay mismatch uncertainty
contributions, reflection coefficients for each port and the cross talk
attenuation have to be known.
The total combined mismatch uncertainty is composed of two parts:
1) The mismatch uncertainty contributions when the RF Relay switches on the
direct polarization signal
2) The mismatch uncertainty contributions when the RF Relay switches on the
cross polarization signal
Each part is composed of two types of uncertainties introduced in the previous
paragraph: the mismatch through the connector between two elements and the
mismatch due to the interaction between several elements.
## A.2.1 First part: RF Relay switched on the co-polarized signal
### A.2.1.1 The mismatch through the connector between two elements
Between the Input1 and the port1:
U~mismatch1~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{11}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the port3 and the Output:
U~mismatch2~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{3} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{33}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the Input2 and the port2:
The RF Relay switchovers on the direct polarization signal. As a result, there
is no mismatch uncertainty contribution.
### A.2.1.2 Mismatch due to the interaction between two elements or more
Between the Input1 and the Output:
U~interaction1~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{3}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{31}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{13}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the Input1 and the Input2:
U~interaction2~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{2}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
The RF Relay switchovers on the cross polarization signal. As a result; this
uncertainty contribution is usually disregarded because of the high crosstalk
attenuation which is characterized by $\left| S_{\text{21}} \right|$ and
$\left| S_{\text{12}} \right|$ \'S\' parameters. If the crosstalk attenuation
is low, this uncertainty contribution has to be considered.
Between the Input2 and the Output:
U~interaction3~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{2} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{3}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{23}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{32}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
The RF Relay switchovers on the cross polarization signal. As a result; this
uncertainty contribution is usually disregarded because of the high cross-talk
attenuation, which is characterized by $\left| S_{\text{23}} \right|$ and
$\left| S_{\text{32}} \right|$ \'S\' parameters. If the crosstalk attenuation
is low, this uncertainty contribution has to be considered.
## A.2.2 Second part: RF relay switched on the cross-polarized signal
### A.2.2.1 The mismatch through the connector between two elements
Between the Input1 and the port1:
The RF Relay switchovers on the direct polarization signal. As a result, there
is no mismatch uncertainty contribution.
Between the port3 and the Output:
U~mismatch3~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{3} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{33}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
Between the Input2 and the port2:
U~mismatch4~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{2} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{22}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
### A.2.2.2 Mismatch due to the interaction between two elements or more
Between the Input1 and the Output:
U~interaction4~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{3}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{31}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{13}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
The RF Relay switchovers on the cross polarization signal. As a result; this
uncertainty contribution is usually disregarded because of the high crosstalk
attenuation which is characterized by $\left| S_{\text{31}} \right|$ and
$\left| S_{\text{13}} \right|$ \'S\' parameters. If the crosstalk attenuation
is low, this uncertainty contribution has to be considered.
Between the Input1 and the Input2:
U~interaction5~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{1} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{2}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{21}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{12}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
The RF Relay switchovers on the cross polarization signal. As a result; this
uncertainty contribution is usually disregarded because of the high crosstalk
attenuation which is characterized by $\left| S_{\text{21}} \right|$ and
$\left| S_{\text{12}} \right|$ \'S\' parameters. If the crosstalk attenuation
is low, this uncertainty contribution has to be considered.
Between the Input2 and the Output:
U~interaction6~(dB) =$\frac{\left| \Gamma_{2} \right| \times \left| \Gamma_{3}
\right| \times \left| S_{\text{23}} \right| \times \left| S_{\text{32}}
\right| \times \text{100}}{\sqrt{2} \times \text{11}\text{.}5}$
## A.2.3 Total combined mismatch uncertainty:
Each non-zero mismatch uncertainty contribution from both parts (RF Relay
switched on the cross and direct polarization signal) are combined by the
root-sum-squares (RSS) method to derive [the total combined mismatch
uncertainty]{.underline}.
The total combined mismatch uncertainty is equal to: [ ]{.underline}
$\sqrt{U_{\text{mismatch}1(\text{dB})} + \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} +
U_{\text{mismatchN}(\text{dB})} +
U_{\text{mismatch}\text{_int}\text{eraction}1(\text{dB})} +
\text{.}\text{.}\text{.} +
U_{\text{mismatch}\text{_int}\text{eractionN}(\text{dB})}}$
If a RF Relay is used to drive the cross and direct polarization signals from
the dual-polarized antenna, this total combined mismatch uncertainty has to be
added with all the uncertainty measurement contributions for the total
combined measurement uncertainty.
# A.3 Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable
If the probe antenna cable does not move between the calibration and the DUT
measurement stage, the uncertainty due to the insertion loss of the cable is
assumed to be systematic. Moreover, this uncertainty is common and constant in
both stages and that is why this leads to 0.00dB value.
If a different cable is used in the calibration measurement and in the DUT
measurement, and the difference of the insertion loss is used in the
calculations, then the overall combined standard uncertainty of the insertion
loss measurement should be used in the uncertainty budget. The distribution of
this uncertainty is assumed to be rectangular, in which case the standard
uncertainty can be calculated as the maximum value/√3.
# A.4 Insertion loss of the probe antenna attenuator (if used)
See Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable
If the probe antenna attenuator is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
# A.5 Insertion loss of the RF relays (if used)
See Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable.
If the RF relay is used in both stages, the uncertainty is considered
systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
# A.6 Influence of the antenna cable
## A.6.1 Probe antenna cable
If the probe antenna is directional (i.e. peak gain >+5dBi e.g. horn, LPDA,
etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for both stages,
the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
In other cases a technical study should be done.
An ETSI technical report [55] (clause D.1.3.6) gives a discussion on the
results obtained by testing a vertically polarized biconical antenna over a
ground plane with differing RF cable configurations.
## A.6.2 Calibration antenna cable
If an efficiency calibration is performed, influence of the calibration
antenna feed cable can be assumed to be negligible, due to data averaging.
In the case of gain calibration, the influence of the calibration antenna feed
cable must be assessed by measurements. A gain calibration measurement is
repeated with a reasonably differing routing of the feed cable. Largest
difference between the results is entered to the uncertainty budget with a
rectangular distribution.
# A.7 Absolute gain of the probe antenna
The uncertainty appears in the both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00dB value.
# A.8 Measurement receiver: uncertainty of absolute level
The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in TRP tests
either as an absolute level or as a relative level. Receiving device used is
typically a Base Station Simulator (BSS), spectrum analyzer (SA), or power
meter (PM). Generally there occurs an uncertainty contribution from limited
absolute level accuracy and non-linearity.
# A.9 Measurement distance
The uncertainty contribution from a finite measurement distance is estimated
in three parts.
## A.9.1 Offset of DUT phase centre from axis(es) of rotation
In all the measurements defined in this test procedure the DUT and phantom
combination is rotated about the ear reference point of SAM phantom, which is
also assumed to be the location of the phase center in both angular directions
of the measurements.
For some turntables this may be practically impossible in which case a
measurement uncertainty contribution can arise because the phase center will
rotate on a non-zero radius about the center of rotation, thereby giving a
variable measurement distance [48] [49]. Data averaging process may lead to a
partial self-cancel of this uncertainty.
The following formula is used to estimate this uncertainty contribution in
stage 1:
U~phase_center_limits~ (dB) = $\text{10}\text{log}(d \pm \text{Δd})^{2} +
\text{10}\text{log}(d)^{2}$
If a gain calibration is performed in Stage 2, the uncertainty contribution of
calibration antenna\'s displacement is estimated with the previous formula.
Misalignment can be estimated with following formula,
U~misaligment~ (dB) = $\text{20}\text{log}\left( \text{cos}\theta \right)$,
where$\theta$ is the misalignment angle between the calibration antenna and
the probe antenna. The contribution shall be added to displacement error:
U~cal~ (dB) = $\sqrt{U_{\text{phase}_{\text{center}_{\Delta}}}^{2} +
U_{\text{misaligment}}^{2}}$
For an efficiency calibration with an omnidirectional calibration antenna, the
U~cal~ is calculated similary as for gain calibration but the uncertainty may
be divided by factor 2. This is due to correcting impact of data averaging in
this type of calibration.
## A.9.2 Mutual coupling
In measurement of radio performances of UMTS mobile phones in speech mode, the
mutual coupling uncertainty for this frequency band is a 0.00dB value (see
annex A-2 in [57]).
The 0.00dB value can be extended for the GSM; DCS and PCS band frequencies.
## A.9.3 Phase curvature
This uncertainty originates from the finite far-field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the DUT. If the measurement distance is >
10λ, this error is assumed to be negligible. At 2 GHz λ is 0.15 m, thus 10λ is
1.5 m.
# A.10 Quality of quiet zone
The uncertainty contribution of the reflectivity level of the anechoic chamber
is determined from the average standard deviation of the electric field in the
quiet zone. By repeating a free space VSWR measurement in 15-degree grid in
elevation and azimuth, 264 standard deviation values in both polarizations are
determined. From these values average standard deviation of electric field in
the quiet zone can be calculated from the equation:
$\overline{S_{\text{freq}}} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n =
1}^{N}{\sum_{m = 1}^{M}{s_{n,m,\text{hor}}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})} +
\frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}{\sum_{m =
1}^{M}{s_{n,m,\text{ver}}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})}}}}{2}$
Where
$N$ is number of angular intervals in elevation,
$M$is number of angular intervals in azimuth and
$\theta_{n}$ is elevation of single measurement$s_{n,m,\text{pol}}$.
If an efficiency calibration with omnidirectional calibration antenna is
performed, the effect of reflectivity level decreases in Stage 2 and
$\overline{S_{\text{freq}}}$may be divided by factor 2. This is due to
correcting impact of data averaging in this type of calibration. Efficiency
calibration done with sampling step ≤ 15°, can be considered to have at least
four independent samples.
It\'s likely that asymmetry of the field probe will have a very small impact
on this measurement uncertainty contributor, however, an upper bound to probe
symmetry should be considered.
# A.11 Tx-power drift of DUT
A single point power reference measurement in the beginning and at the end of
the measurement procedure is recommended to monitor the power drift of the
DUT. Based on TX-power drift measurements for typical 3G UE, an uncertainty of
0.2 dB shall be entered to uncertainty budget with a rectangular distribution.
If the drift measurement indicates larger drift, the actual drift shall be
included to uncertainty.
_In order to minimize Tx-power drift error it\'s recommended to interleave
sensitivity and power measurement of multiple channels. This spreads the
measurements over a longer period, which helps to average the drift of the TX-
power._
Typical TX-power drifts of 3G UE, measured in a single angular point, DUT
placed against phantom head are shown in Figure 5.

Figure A.5. Output power variation of typical 3G UE during battery life.
# A.12 Uncertainty related to the use of phantoms
## A.12.1 Uncertainty from using different types of SAM phantom
This uncertainty contribution originates from the fact that different
laboratories may use the two different versions of SAM head: the SAM head
phantom or the SAM phantom including the head and the shoulders. Based on the
conclusions made in [18] [14] [25] [58], the standard SAM head is the
specified phantom. However, the use of the other type of SAM is also allowed
with the requirement that the resulting uncertainty contribution is taken into
account in the uncertainty budget [48], [49].
## A.12.2 Simulated tissue liquid uncertainty
This uncertainty will occur, if the laboratory uses a liquid which has
dielectric parameters deviating more than ±15% of the target parameters given
in chapter 5.1.
## A.12.3 Uncertainty of dielectric properties and shape of the hand phantom
The hand phantom makes a contribution to OTA measurement uncertainty due to
the manufacturing tolerances of its dielectric properties and shape. The
dielectric properties on the surface of the hand may differ from those of its
interior, so both are included in the evaluation. The molded exterior surface
of the hand shall be measured directly with an open-ended coaxial probe. The
interior hand material is evaluated indirectly, by substituting a cube-shaped
sample molded from the same material and having some exterior surfaces
removed. Following procedure will be used to evaluate the dielectric
properties of the hand phantom;
1\. Each hand shall be manufactured together with a reference cube of the same
material. The sides of the reference cube shall be not less than 40 mm in
length.

In case the hand phantoms are manufactured within CAD models referenced in
chapter 5, the tolerance is 2% and therefore the effects shape errors are
negligible. If the tolerance is larger, a numerical study must be conducted.
## A.12.4 Uncertainty from using different types of Laptop Ground Plane
phantom
This uncertainty contribution originates from the fact that different
laboratories may use different variations of Laptop Ground Plane phantom.
Based on Section 5.1.3, the standard Laptop Ground Plane is the specified
phantom.
# A.13 Coarse sampling grid
Degreasing of sampling density to finite amount of samples affects the
measurement uncertainty by two different errors. First is due to inadequate
number of samples and second is a systematic discrimination approximation
error in TRP and TRS equations.
Figure A.6 shows simulated sampling grid errors for typical 3G UE.
Approximation error is not included. Simulations are based on thin plate
surface interpolation of real radiation patters, measured beside a phantom
head.

Figure A.6. Simulated TPR/TRS error as a function of sampling grid.
The offset of systematic approximation error can be expressed by using formula
$\text{Offset} = \text{10} \cdot \text{log}\text{10}\left(
\frac{\pi}{2N}\sum_{n - 1}^{N}{\text{sin}\left( \theta_{n} \right)} \right)$.
where
$N$ is number of angular intervals in elevation,
$\theta_{n}$ is elevation.

Figure A.7. Approximation error of TRP/TRS.
The 10° or 15° sampling grid used in TRP measurements has been shown to
introduce only very small differences as compared to the results obtained with
denser grids, so with that sampling grid the uncertainty contribution can
assumed negligible [36].
When using sample step size of 15° - 30°, standard uncertainty of 0.15dB can
be assumed to cover errors. If step size >30° is used, larger uncertainty
should be considered.
Note: the simulation results presented here are not usable for irregular
sampling grids or in the case of MEG/MERS.
# A.14 Random uncertainty
The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous effects
which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of uncertainty with a
repeatability test by making a series of repeated measurement with a reference
DUT without changing anything in the measurement set-up.
The random uncertainty differs from one laboratory to another. Moreover, each
DUT has its own electromagnetic behaviour and random uncertainty. Some
uncertainty also occurs from the positioning of the DUT against the SAM
phantom, as the DUT cannot be attached exactly in the same way every time.
This uncertainty depends on how much the DUT\'s positioning against the SAM
phantom and hand phantoms varies from the specified testing positions. It is
noted that the uncertainty of the phone positioning depends on the phone
holder and the measurement operator and is in fact difficult to distinguish
from random uncertainty. Some uncertainty also occurs from the positioning of
the DUT plugged into the Laptop Ground Plane phantom, as the DUT may not be
plugged into the USB connector and positioned exactly in the same way every
time. This uncertainty depends on how much the DUT\'s position plugged into
the Laptop Ground Plane phantom varies from the specified plug-in position.
Therefore, the positioning uncertainty is included in random uncertainty. A
study on the influence of misalignment errors to the measurement uncertainty
has been presented in [72].
To estimate this uncertainty for the SAM phantom, it is suggested to perform
at least five evaluations of TRP/TRS whereby the device shall be dismounted
and newly positioned with a fully charged battery before each tests. This
measurement set has to be carried out in mid channel of lowest and highest
frequency bands utilized by the testing lab, for at least three phones with
different type of mechanical design. The values have to be normalized by the
mean for each measurement set. As a result the uncertainty contribution
entered to uncertainty budget is the difference between the maximum and
minimum normalized value.
With head and hand phantoms, random uncertainty evaluation may be done
separately for each measurement configuration i.e. head only, browsing mode or
speech mode. A speech mode random uncertainty evaluation, were both head and
hand phantoms are used, can reasonably be considered to be the worst-case
scenario and thus random uncertainties in other configurations to be less.
To estimate this uncertainty for the Laptop Ground Plane phantom, it is
suggested to perform at least five evaluations of TRP/TRS for the plug-in
position whereby the device shall be dismounted and newly positioned before
each tests. This measurement set has to be carried out in mid channel of
lowest and highest frequency bands utilized by the testing lab, for at least
three USBs with different type of mechanical design. The values have to be
normalized by the mean for each measurement set. As a result the uncertainty
contribution entered to uncertainty budget is the difference between the
maximum and minimum normalized value.
# A.15 Uncertainty of network analyzer
This uncertainty includes the all uncertainties involved in the S21
measurement with a network analyzer, and will be calculated from the
manufacturer\'s data in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise
informed, (see clause 5.1.2 in [56]).
# A.16 Uncertainty of the gain/efficiency of the calibration antenna
The calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the
gain/efficiency uncertainty has to be taken into account.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with
a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed (see clause 5.1.2 in
[56]).
If the manufacturer\'s data do not give the information, the value has to be
checked, see annex A-12 in [57]
# A.17 Base station simulator: uncertainty of the absolute level
The transmitter device (typically a BS Simulator) is used to drive a signal to
the horn antenna in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a
relative level. Receiving device used is typically a UE/MS. Generally there
occurs uncertainty contribution from limited absolute level accuracy and non-
linearity of the BS Simulator.
For practical reasons, the calibration measurement (Stage 2) should be only
performed with the probe antenna as a receiver. Hence, the uncertainty on the
absolute level of the transmitter device cannot be assumed as systematic. This
uncertainty should be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with a
rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed (see clause 5.1.2 in
[56]). Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity of the device is
included in the absolute level uncertainty.
# A.18 BER measurement: output level step resolution
When output power of the BS simulator is swept to reach the BER target, used
power step resolution creates this uncertainty. Output power step used in the
BER measurement is divided by factor 2 to obtain the uncertainty with
rectangular distribution.
# A.19 Statistical uncertainty of the BER measurement
To study statistical uncertainty of BER measurement, see ETSI document TR 100
028-1, section 6.6 [55]. For a BER target of 1%±0.2% using 20000 bits,
uncertainty of 0.19 dB for a single measurement can be used. Using a BER
target of 10%±2% with 20000 tested bits will lead to uncertainty of
0.46dB/single measurement.
For a full TRS measurement with a regular sampling grid, the statistical
uncertainty can be approximated by using the following formula:
$U_{\text{fullTRS}} = \frac{U_{\text{SingleTRS}}}{\sqrt{N/4}}$,
Where
$U_{\text{SingleTRS}}$ is the statistical uncertainty of single measurement,
$N$ is the number of measurements.
# A.20 BER data rate normalization uncertainty
This uncertainty occurs only when a higher data rate than 12.2kbps is used to
speed up TRS measurement. It can be calculated using following formula:
$U_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\sqrt{\left( \frac{U_{\text{SingleTRSref}}}{2}
\right)^{2} + \left( \frac{U_{\text{SingleTRSfast}}}{2}
\right)^{2}}}{\sqrt{N_{\text{ref}}}}$ ,
Where
$U_{\text{SingleTRSref}}$ is the statistical uncertainty of the used reference
measurement,
$U_{\text{SingleTRSfast}}$is the statistical uncertainty of the higher data
rate measurement,
$N_{\text{ref}}$Is the number of measured reference points.
# A.21 DUT sensitivity drift
Due to statistical uncertainty of BER measurement, drift in the TRS can not be
monitored similary to TRP. An uncertainty value of 0.2dB can be used, or the
TRS drift should be measured, with a setup corresponding to the actual TRS
measurement.
# A.22 Cable loss measurement uncertainty
Before performing the calibration, cable losses have to be measured. This
measurement includes a standard uncertainty, which is composed of the
mismatch, and the insertion loss uncertainties. In the calibration
measurement, the transmitter part is composed with the calibration antenna,
cables, and signal generator. The receiver part is composed with the probe
antenna, cables, and measurement device.
The cable loss of transmitter and receiver parts should be measured
separately. By this way, the cable losses will be compliant with the cable
routing of the calibration stage. On the opposite, if the cable losses were
measured together at the same time, the measured values would include errors
from miscellaneous mismatch contributions, which do not appear in the cable
routing of the calibration stage.
The cable loss measurement uncertainty is the result of the RSS of the
uncertainty contributions listed in Table A.4.
Table A.4. Uncertainty contributions in the cable loss measurement.
* * *
Description of uncertainty contribution Standard Uncertainty (dB) Mismatch
uncertainty of cable(s) receiver part  
Insertion loss of the cable(s) receiver part  
Measurement device: absolute level uncertainty  
Measurement device: linearity  
Mismatch uncertainty of cable(s) transmitter part  
Insertion loss of the cable(s) transmitter part  
Signal generator: absolute output level uncertainty  
Signal generator: output level stability uncertainty  
Cable loss measurement uncertainty (RSS)
* * *
# A.23 Signal generator: uncertainty of the absolute output level
The signal generator is only used at this stage. It substitutes the DUT by
feeding the calibration antenna with a known power level. The use of this
signal generator introduces an uncertainty on the absolute output level.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with
a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [56]).
# A.24 Signal generator: output level stability
The uncertainty on the output level stability has to be taken into account
only when the uncertainty of the absolute level is not considered.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with
a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [56]).
# A.25 Insertion loss: calibration antenna feed cable
The feed cable of the calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. As a
result, this uncertainty has to be taken into account.
This uncertainty will be measured or calculated from the manufacturer\'s data
in logs with a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [56]).
# A.26 Insertion loss: calibration antenna attenuator (if used)
If a calibration antenna attenuator is used, it only appears in Stage 2. As a
result, this uncertainty has to be taken into account.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs with
a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [56]).
# A.27 Chamber Statistical Ripple and Repeatability
The uncertainty due to chamber statistics is determined by repeated
calibration measurements as described in Annex G. This uncertainty
contribution is a composite value consisting of most of the specific
reverberation chamber contributions, such as limited number of modes and mode-
stirring techniques.
The uncertainty contribution value shall be determined by measurements as
described in Annex G and be assumed to have a normal distribution.
# A.28 Additional Power Loss in EUT Chassis
When the EUT is small and do not add noticeable loss to the chamber, the
calibration procedure outlined in section E.3, is performed without the EUT
present in the chamber. The possible difference in average chamber
transmission level between the EUT measurement and the reference measurement
must in this case be considered in the uncertainty evaluation.
The uncertainty value for this contribution can be tested empirically by
choosing a unit within a set of samples which is considered to incur the
highest amount of loss (normally the largest unit), and measure the average
transmission loss in the chamber with and without the test unit present in the
chamber. The difference between the two cases shall be used in the uncertainty
calculation and the distribution should be assumed to be rectangular.
Alternatively, a fixed value of 0.2 dB with a rectangular distribution can be
used in the uncertainty calculations.

###### ## Annex C (informative): System Parameters
# C.1 Definition and applicability
This test is aimed at measuring the output power radiated by a 3G UE/MS under
the \"speech mode\" conditions, that is, the usual position for voice
application when the handset is held close to the user head, without any
hands-free kit.
Radio measurements are performed in the so-called open area mode in such as
way to be as close as possible to the free space conditions.
# C.2 Establishing the connection
In order to be as close as possible to the real conditions of use, it is
necessary to establish the connection between the UE/MS under test and the
Node-B simulator. It makes thus possible to set up the communication
parameters to simulate a conversational link.
## C.2.1 Required parameters to initiate the communication - basic concepts
### C.2.1.1 Conversational RAB
In UMTS, services provided by the Radio Access Network (RAN) to the Core
Network (CN) are called Radio Access Bearers (RAB). One RAB consists of one
Radio Bearer (RB) plus one Iu Bearer.
RAB are classified into 4 different QoS classes: Conversational, Streaming,
Interactive or Background. For speech services, **conversational class** shall
be used.
### C.2.1.2 Logical, transport, and physical channels in UMTS
The Radio Bearer service is provided through a layered architecture of
channels (logical, transport and physical channels).
For speech services, the logical channel shall be a DTCH (Dedicated Traffic
Channel), on a DCH (Dedicated Channel) as transport channel, on a DPCH
(Dedicated Physical Channel) that consists of two physical channels named
DPDCH (Dedicated Physical Data Channel) and DPCCH (Dedicated Physical Control
Channel).
### C.2.1.3 Dedicated physical channel
In the Uplink (UL), the DPDCH is transmitted on the I-path whereas the DPCCH
is transmitted over the Q-path (QPSK modulation).
In the Downlink (DL), DPDCH and DPCCH are time multiplexed.
## C.2.2 Recall on the reference measurement channel (reference to the
standard paragraph)
To perform test measurements, a 12.2kbps Reference Measurement Channel is
defined in the specification document [60], both for uplink and downlink.
This specific channel can be considered as a typical conversational one. Its
organisation and features match the requirements previously described to
establish a conversational link and are listed in the following tables:

# D.6 Output power measurement
Measurements are carried out on the TCH and during the chosen TS. The

## D.6.1 TRP
For each position, the average power of the TS (TxLev) is measured.
## D.6.2 TRS
The sensitivity measurement is a time-consuming process: it is necessary to
measure, step by step and for every position, the received RF level associated
to a BER equal to 2.4 % following [61] and [62].
# D.7 Measurement procedure -- transmitter performance
## D.7.1 Transmitter performance measurement
### D.7.1.1 Spherical scanning ranges
See 7.1 of the core of the pre-standard.
## D.7.2 Reference position
The MS is placed on the positioner mounted on a turntable (see Figure 7.1).
Then, the reference position (θ = ϕ = 0°) has to be determined. As an example,
in the great circle case, and for a standalone mobile, the handset is held in
a horizontal position as shown in chapter 5.1 of the core of the pre-standard.
The vertical axis goes through the base of the antenna. The mobile is rotated
around its main axis (ϕ angle) step by step. For each ϕ step position, the θ
angle is increased step by step.
For measurements with the SAM head phantom, the principle is exactly the same.
The only differences concern the initial positioning of the mobile/SAM system.
In fact, the SAM head is held in a horizontal position as shown in chapter 5.1
of the core of the pre-standard. The vertical axis goes through the base of
SAM ear, and the MS is held in a normalized position: see Figure 2.1 of the
core of the pre-standard.
## D.7.3 General measurement arrangements
### D.7.3.1 TRP
See 7.2 of the core of the pre-standard.
The communication is initialized so that the MS emits at maximum power level

* * *
An example of a method to obtain the TRP is to measure the 3-D TxLev pattern
on the central channel of each bandwidth supported by the MS, and integrate it
as explained in 6.1 of the core of the pre-standard. So as to check the
transmitter performances of the MS over the whole considered bandwidth, it
would be necessary to calculate the TRP on every channel. However such a
measurement is highly time-consuming.
To reduce the duration of the test, referring to the 3-D pattern measured on
the central channel, the MS can be put in the (θ,ϕ)-position giving the
maximum power received at the probe antenna in the main polarization. In this
position, the transmitted power can be measured on every channel, and a mean
value over the bandwidth can be calculated. The difference (in dB) between the
power averaged over all the channels and the value obtained on the central
channel in the chosen position can be calculated. It gives a weighting
coefficient to apply to the TRP value given by the 3-D measurement done on the
central channel.
This final value gives a good single figure of merit of the radiated power
performances of the MS over the whole bandwidth.
### D.7.3.2 TRS
An example of a method to obtain the TRS is to measure the 3-D sensitivity
pattern on the central channel of each bandwidth supported by the MS, and
integrate it as explained in 6.2 of the core of the pre-standard. The
sensitivity measurement over all angular positions is a highly time-consuming
process.
To speed up the process, an example of a method to obtain the TRS is to use
the RxLev parameter (MS estimation of the received power). The RxLev is a
parameter which can be measured in parallel with the TxLev.
After having measured the TxLev and RxLev patterns, the MS is positioned in
the (θ~0~,ϕ~0~)-position giving the maximum power received at the probe
antenna in the main polarization. The sensitivity measurement in (θ~0~,ϕ~0~)
gives a correlation between the Sensi and the RxLev. From this correlation,
the sensitivity in every angular position and polarization can be deduced. The
process to evaluate the 3-D sensitivity pattern is completely described in the
following paragraphs.
a) Sensitivity measurement in the (θ~0~,ϕ~0~)-position
The BS simulator should configure the MS in Loop back mode [61] [62]. Then,
the minimum received power is associated to a BER equal to 2.4% (+/- 0.1%) is
determined. This power is called sensitivity (Sensi) at the chosen position.
The sensitivity measurement has to be carried out on a sufficient number of
speech frames, so as to obtain a steady and repeatable value. The experience
shows that 300 frames is a sufficient number.
b) Deduction of the sensitivity in every position
Let ∆ be defined such as:
∆ = \|Sensi(θ~0~,ϕ~0~)\| - RxLev(θ~0~,ϕ~0~)
Then the Sensi in all other positions is deduced as follows:
Sensi(θ,ϕ)= RxLev(θ,ϕ) + ∆
To avoid communication fall, the RxLev has to be measured at a quite high TCH
level received by the MS (example --60.5 dBm which corresponds to a RxLev
equal to 50). Find hereunder the table of correspondence between the TCH and
Rx levels:
Figure D.4
Note that, so as to check the receiver performances of the MS over the whole
considered bandwidth, it would be necessary to calculate the TRS on every
channel. However such a measurement is highly time-consuming.
To reduce the duration of such a test, referring to the 3-D pattern measured
on the central channel, the MS can be put in the (θ~0~,ϕ~0~)-position. In this
position, the sensitivity can be measured on every channel, and a mean value
over the bandwidth can be calculated. The difference (in dB) between the
sensitivity averaged over all the channels, and the value obtained on the
central channel in the (θ~0~,ϕ~0~)-position can be calculated. It gives a
weighting coefficient to apply to the TRS value given by the 3-D measurement
done on the central channel.
This final value gives a good single figure of merit of the radiated
sensitivity performances of the MS over the whole bandwidth.

###### ## Annex E (informative): Alternative measurement technologies:
reverberation chamber method
# E.1 Reverberation chamber constraints
This section defines basic parameters of reverberation chambers for
measurements of the radio performance of a 3G UE/MS.
The reverberation chambers [63] have for a couple of decades been used for
some types of EMC measurements. A reverberation chamber is a metal cavity that
is sufficiently large to support many resonant modes, and it is provided with
means to stir the modes. The classical radiation efficiency characterizes the
antenna performance in a uniform and isotropic multipath environment, and it
is shown in [11] that this fastly and accurately can be measured in a small
reverberation chamber.
The reverberation chamber provides a simulated multipath environment with the
same Rayleigh field statistics as actual multipath environments [16]. The
environment is isotropic with a uniform elevation and azimuth distribution
[64] and polarization imbalance, which could prevail in the reverberation
chamber, can be removed [13]. This makes it a well-defined and repeatable
environment for TRP testing of mobile terminals.
In addition to the TRP testing of UE, the reverberation chamber can be used to
measure the BER [65] and thereby also the TRS. In addition, it has been
demonstrated that it can be used to measure the average fading sensitivity
(AVF) [66], corresponding to performance in an environment that fades with a
certain speed.
Reverberation chambers can also be used for direct test of diversity antennas
in multipath environment [67][68]. The effective, apparent or actual diversity
gains can be determined directly from the statistical distribution of the
received signal amplitudes [69]. It is also possible to test the complete
active UE with its implemented diversity algorithm, as demonstrated for a DECT
phone in [70].
The measurements in the reverberation chamber are fast and repeatable,
provided the chambers utilize efficient stirring methods. The following
sections describe how the reverberation chamber can be used for measurements
of TRP and TRS.
## E.1.1 Chamber size
The reverberation chamber shall have a volume large enough to support the
number of modes needed for the stated accuracy at the lowest operating
frequency. If the UE/MS is moved around in the chamber during the measurement,
the volume of the reverberation chamber can be reduced [11]. Also, frequency
stirring can be used to improve the accuracy, however this will reduce the
resolution of the results correspondingly [12].
## E.1.2 Mode-stirring facilities
The reverberation chamber shall be equipped with mode-stirring in such a way
that enough number of independent power samples can be achieved for the
accuracy requirement stated in this standard to be fulfilled. Possible mode-
stirring methods include platform stirring [11], polarization stirring [13],
and mechanical stirring with fan-type stirrers, irregular shaped rotational
stirrers, or plate-type stirrers. Also frequency stirring is possible if the
type of measurement allows for a frequency-averaged value, but this is not
necessary if the chamber is sufficiently and well stirred. A schematic picture
of the measurement setup is provided in Figure E.1.

Figure E.1: Schematic picture of the reverberation chamber measurement setup
## E.1.3 Loading of chamber with lossy objects
The reverberation chamber can be loaded with lossy objects in order to control
the power delay profile in the chamber to some extent. However the
reverberation chamber should not be loaded to such an extent that the mode
statistics in the chamber are destroyed. It is important to keep the same
amount of lossy objects in the chamber during calibration measurement and test
measurement, in order not to change the average power transfer function
between these two cases.
## E.1.4 Polarization imbalance and receiving antennas
It is important that the statistical distribution of waves in the chamber
corresponds to the chosen test environment. Present knowledge about
reverberation chambers limits this to isotropic environments, i.e. the TRP and
TRS parameters can be measured. Since the probability of each polarization is
equal in the isotropic environment, a check of the polarization imbalance in
the reverberation chamber must be done.
The polarization imbalance can be obtained during the calibration measurement
by measuring both when the calibration antenna is oriented for vertical
polarization and when it is oriented for horizontal polarization. These two
values shall differ by less than the specification in Table E.1. In order to
obtain values for comparison with the results in the table, the reference
levels shall be measured for both orientations of the calibration dipole at 8
different positions of the dipole inside the chamber. The average, standard
deviation and maximum deviation shall be evaluated by comparing results for
both polarizations over the whole set of 8 measurements. Alternatively, the
levels for the two polarizations of the calibration antenna at 1 MHz intervals
between 1900 MHz and 2200 MHz can be measured, and thereafter the average,
standard deviation and maximum of the difference between the two sets of
values over these frequency ranges are calculated.
An effective way of avoiding polarization imbalance is to use polarization
stirring, i.e. using three orthogonal linearly polarized receiving antennas.
These three receiving antennas may be monopoles connected orthogonally to
three different and orthogonal walls (including ceiling/floor) of the chamber.
The three antennas are below referred to as the three fixed wall mounted
antennas.
_Table E.1 Specifications of differences of measured reference levels in each
frequency band between using vertically and horizontally polarized calibration
dipoles._
* * *
                       Maximum tolerable value
Average 0.2 dB Standard deviation 0.5 dB Maximum 1.0 dB
* * *
## E.1.5 Shielding effectiveness
The shielding effectiveness of the chamber shall be as large as needed for the
interference from other sources not to influence the measured parameters. This
means that the requirements of the shielding is specific to each test site and
may vary accordingly.
# E.2 Reverberation chamber method
This section describes how TRP and TRS can be calculated from reverberation
chamber data.
## E.2.1 Measurement procedure -- transmitter performance
The measurement of transmitter performance in the reverberation chamber is
based on sampling the radiated power of the UE/MS for a discrete number of
field combinations in the chamber. The average value of these statistically
distributed samples is proportional to the Total Radiated Power (TRP), and by
calibrating the average power transfer function in the chamber, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained.
Setup the DUT by locating the head phantom and the UE/MS in one of the
specified positions inside the chamber. It is important that the objects
placed inside the chamber during DUT measurements are the same as those
present during the calibration measurement.
Measure and save DUT radiated power levels for all the positions of the
platform stirrer and mechanical stirrer and for all the frequency points used.
Do this for each of the chamber\'s fixed measurement antennas. Average the
saved DUT power levels over all stirrer positions. Note that all averaging
must be performed using linear power values (e.g measurements in Watts). Thus
the following equation applies
$\text{TRP} = \frac{\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\left( \frac{P_{n}}{C_{n}\left( 1 - R_{n}
\right)} \right)}{\sum_{n = 1}^{N}P_{\text{ref},n}}$ (E.1)
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
$P_{n} = \frac{\sum_{m = 1}^{M}\left| S_{\text{21},n,m} \right|^{2}}{M}$
(E.1.a)
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
## E.2.2 Measurement procedure -- receiver performance
The DUT'sTRS can also be calculated from measurements made in a Rayleigh
fading three dimensional isotropic environment with uniform elevation and
azimuth distribution. The calculation of TRS is in based on searching for the
lowest power received by the UE/MS for a discrete number of field combinations
in the chamber. The power received by the UE at each discrete field
combination that provides a BER (or BLER) which is better than the specified
target BER/BLER level shall be averaged with other such measurements using
different field combinations. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained when the linear values
of all downlink power levels described above have been averaged. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
$\text{TRS} = 2N\frac{\left( \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\left( C_{n}\left( 1 - R_{n}
\right)P_{\text{thres},n} \right) \right)^{- 1}}{\sum_{n =
1}^{N}P_{\text{ref},n}}$ (E.1.b)
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
$P_{\text{thres},n} = \frac{\sum_{m = 1}^{M}\frac{1}{\left|
S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}}}{M}$ (E.1.c)
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.
# E.3 Calibration of reverberation chamber
The purpose of calibration measurement is to determine the average power
transfer function in the chamber, mismatch of the chamber's fixed measurement
antennas and path losses in cables connecting the power sampling instrument
and the fixed measurement antennas. A Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) should be
used for these measurements. Recommended calibration antennas are dipoles
tuned to the frequency band of interest.
In general, the calibration of a reverberation chamber is performed in three
steps:
1) Measurement of S-parameters through the reverberation chamber for a
complete stirring sequence
2) Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function
3) Measurement of connecting cable insertion loss
If several setups are used (e.g. empty chamber, chamber with head phantom,
etc.), steps 1 and 2 must be repeated for each configuration. The calibration
measurement setup can be studied in Figure E.2.
{width="5.770833333333333in" height="3.0416666666666665in"}
Figure E.2 Calibration measurement setup in the reverberation chamber, using a
vector network analyzer.
## E.3.1 Measurement of S-parameters through the chamber for a complete
stirring sequence
i. This step will measure S-parameters through the reverberation chamber
through a complete stirring sequence. This information is required to
determine the chamber's reference transfer function. The procedure must be
performed separately for each measurement setup in which the loading of the
chamber has been changed. The calibration procedure must be repeated for each
frequency as defined above. Therefore, it is advantageous if the network
analyzer can be set to a frequency sweep covering the defined frequencies, so
that all frequencies of interest can be measured with a minimal number of
measurement runs.Place all objects into the RC which will be used during TRP
or TRS measurements, including a head phantom, hand phantom and fixture for
the EUT. This ensures that the loss in the chamber, which determines the
average power transfer level, is the same during both calibration and test
measurements. Also, if the EUT is large or contains many antennas, it may
represent a noticeable loading of the chamber. It should then be present in
the chamber and turned on during the calibration.
ii. Place the calibration antenna inside the chamber. The calibration antenna
is preferably mounted on a low-loss dielectric fixture, to avoid effects from
the fixture itself which may affect the EUT's radiation efficiency and
mismatch factor. The calibration antenna must be placed in the chamber in such
a way that it is far enough from any walls, mode-stirrers, head phantom, or
other object, such that the environment for the calibration antenna (taken
over the complete stirring sequence) resembles a free space environment** _.
"Far enough away" depends on the type of calibration antenna used. For low
gain nearly omni-directional antennas like dipoles, it is normally sufficient
to ensure that this spacing is larger than 0.5 wavelengths from reflective
objects and 0.7 wavelengths from absorbing objects at the lowest operating
frequency. More directive calibration antennas should be situated towards the
center of the chamber. The calibration antenna should remain present in the
chamber during the TRP/TRS measurements._**
iii. Calibrate the network analyzer with a full 2-port calibration in such a
way that the vector S-parameters between the ports of the fixed measurement
antenna and the calibration antenna can be accurately measured. Preferably,
the network analyzer is set to perform a frequency sweep at each stirrer
position. This will enable calibration of several frequency points during the
same stirring sequence, thereby reducing calibration time. This will also
enable frequency stirring, i.e., averaging the measured power transfer
function over a small frequency bandwidth around each measured frequency point
(moving frequency window). This will increase accuracy at the expense of
frequency resolution.
iv. Connect the antennas and measure the S-parameters for each fixed
measurement antenna.
The number of stirrer positions in the chosen stirring sequence, i.e. the
number of S-parameter samples at each frequency point, should be chosen in
such a way that it is large enough to yield an acceptable statistical
contribution to the total measurement uncertainty. As a guideline, the sample
size should be larger than 100, preferably 200 or 400 to ensure that the
number of independent samples is not severely limited by the total number of
samples measured. The number of independent samples, which is a subset of all
samples, determines the statistical contribution to the expanded accuracy
(which is two times the standard deviation). This should be larger than 100 to
ensure an expanded accuracy better than 1 dB. The number of independent
samples depends on the operating frequency, volume of the chamber, efficacy of
the chamber's stirrers, the level of loading by absorbing objects, and whether
or not frequency stirring is used.
The sequence of moving the stirrers to different positions may be either step-
wise (stopping stirrer for each sample) or continuous (sampling on-the-fly).
With continuous stirring it may not be possible to characterize the chamber
over a wide frequency band at the same time.
## E.3.2 Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function
From the S-parameters obtained in the calibration measurement, the chamber
reference transfer function for fixed antenna _n_ can be calculated. The
reflection coefficient for fixed antenna _n_ can be calculated as
$R_{n} = \left| \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m = 1}^{M}S_{\text{11},n,m} \right|^{2} =
\left| \overline{S_{\text{11},n}} \right|^{2}$ (E.2)
Thus, the chamber reference transfer function can be calculated as
$P_{\text{ref},n} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m = 1}^{M}\frac{\left| S_{\text{21},n,m}
\right|^{2}}{\left( 1 - R_{n} \right)\left( 1 - \left|
\overline{S_{\text{22}}} \right|^{2} \right)} \cdot \frac{1}{e_{\text{ref}}}$
(E.3)
where _M_ is the total number of samples of the transfer function measured for
each fixed measurement antenna and $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of
the transfer function for measurement antenna n. Moreover,
$\overline{S_{\text{22}}}$ is the complex average of the calibration antenna
reflection coefficient. Finally, $e_{\text{ref}}$ is the radiation efficiency
of the calibration antenna.
Note that the radiation efficiency of the fixed antenna is not corrected for,
because it will be the same both during calibration and measurements.
Therefore the fixed antenna's radiation efficiency will not affect the final
results. The same can be said about the mismatch factor of the fixed
measurement antennas, but it is still advantageous to correct for this factor
if frequency stirring is applied to improve accuracy.
## E.3.3 Cable calibration
This measurement step will calibrate the power loss of the cable needed to
connect the instrument used to measure the received power at the fixed
measurement antenna during TRP measurements, and to generate the power
radiated by the fixed antenna during TRS measurements.
i. Disconnect the cables between the VNA and the chamber.
ii. Connect the cables one-by-one between the two ports of the VNA. Note that
VNA must be calibrated such that the reference plane corresponds to its own
two ports.
iii. Measure the frequency response of the transmission S-parameter ( or ) of
the cable.
iv. Save the power transfer values () of the frequency response curve for the
test frequencies.
# E.4 Estimation of measurement uncertainty
See Annex A.
###### ## Annex F (informative): Anechoic chamber specifications and
validation method
This Annex presents the specifications for the shielded anechoic chamber and
the validation methods.
# F.1 Shielded anechoic chamber specifications
Before measuring the test site characteristics in the presence of the antenna
positioning system, the shielding effectiveness of the enclosure and the quiet
zone level must be measured.
To avoid environmental perturbations the measurements must be performed in a
shielded enclosure, preserved from electromagnetic disturbances coming from
electromagnetic environment (Radio and TV broadcast, cellular, ISM equipment,
etc...). The shielding effectiveness recommended to be tested according to the
EN 50 147-1 standard in the frequency range of 800 MHz up to 4 GHz.
The recommended level of the shielding effectiveness is -100 dB from 800 MHz
to 4 GHz.
Testing of the shielding effectiveness can be performed either before or after
the installation of absorbers.
# F.2 Quiet Zone reflectivity level validation
The performance of anechoic chamber is typically evaluated from reflectivity
level $R_{\text{level}}$ in the quiet zone. Reflection level is defined as
power ratio of [all]{.underline} summed reflected signals $P_{r}$ to direct
signal $P_{d}$ from antenna:
$R_{\text{level}} = \text{10}\text{log}\frac{P_{r}}{P_{d}}$ . (1)
To evaluate the quiet zone reflectivity level, the contribution of absorbing
materials, the antenna positioning system and other constructions in the
anechoic chamber should be measured. Two most common methods for measuring the
reflectivity level of the quiet zone are Free Space VSWR Method and the Time
Domain Method. Traditionally these measurements have been accomplished by
using high gain horn antennas. Studies have shown that using horn antenna can
give about 14 dB lower reflectivity levels compared to use of dipole antenna
[72]. However, the methods that utilize highly directive antennas are powerful
in identifying the direction of the offending reflections.
To measure accurately quality of the quite zone in anechoic chamber one must
use an omni-directional antenna. Near omni-directional three axes field-probes
are available with fibre optic connection thus minimizing cable effects.
Because sensitivity of field probe is limited one must carefully check that
the field probe is operated at least 6dB above the noise floor of the probe.
Note: The quiet zone evaluation should be performed with the antenna
positioning system in its place, in order to include its effect on the
reflectivity level.
## F.2.1 Description of a practical method for Quiet Zone characterization
In the following, a practical version of the Free Space VSWR method is
presented [73].
In the Free Space VSWR method the quality of quite zone is measured from
amplitude ripple caused by reflections inside the anechoic chamber. Phase
variation of the direct signal and the reflected signals is obtained by moving
a field-probe in the quiet zone. Amplitude ripple in the quiet zone is caused
by this phase variation of reflected signals and the direct signal from
antenna. The figure F.1 below shows seven measuring positions.
{width="5.997222222222222in" height="2.1770833333333335in"}
Figure F.1: Measurement positions with 150mm separation
In each of the seven-measurement position amplitude of power received by
field-probe $P_{\text{meas}_{n}}$[dBm] is measured where $n$is index of
measuring position. Variance of measurement distance to the antenna from
field-probe in different measurement positions can be compensated by following
equation:
$P_{n} = P_{\text{meas}_{n}} + \text{20}\text{log}(\frac{d_{n}}{l})$ where,
(2)
$d_{n}$is distance to point $n$ from the antenna,
$l$is distance to centre of quiet zone from the antenna
$P_{\text{meas}_{n}}$is uncorrected measurement value from point $n$.
The sample standard deviation of the electric field in the quiet zone can be
calculated from these distance corrected values or directly from the measured
values with the following equation:
$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\left( P_{i} - \overline{P}
\right)^{2}}$ where, (3)
$N$ is number of measurements positions
$\overline{P}$ is dB average of all $P_{n}$
$P_{i}$ is $P_{n}$ or $P_{\text{meas}_{n}}$
**Standard deviation of electric field**
To obtain more accurate picture of quality of quiet zone, measurement
described in previous chapter can be done from multiple directions and
polarizations. Doing free space VSWR measurement from different directions in
15-degree separation for elevation and azimuth we get 264 standard deviation
values in both polarizations ($s_{\theta,\Phi,\text{pol}}$). From these values
average sample standard deviation in electric field in quiet zone can be
calculated from equation:
$\overline{S_{\text{freq}}} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2\text{IJ}}\sum_{i =
1}^{I}{\sum_{j = 1}^{J}{s_{i,j,\text{hor}}\text{sin}(\Theta_{i})} +
\frac{\pi}{2\text{IJ}}\sum_{i = 1}^{I}{\sum_{j =
1}^{J}{s_{i,j,\text{ver}}\text{sin}(\Theta_{i})}}}}{2}$, (4)
Where
$I$ is number of angular intervals in elevation,
$J$ is number of angular intervals in azimuth and
$\Theta_{i}$ is elevation of measurement $s_{i,j,\text{pol}}$.
This quiet zone quality measurement should be done at all the frequencies used
in measurements.
###### ## Annex G (informative): Reverberation chamber specifications and
validation method
This Annex presents the specifications for the shielded reverberation chamber
and the validation methods.
# G.1 Shielded reverberation chamber specifications
Before measuring the test site characteristics in terms of stirring
effectiveness etc., the shielding effectiveness of the metallic enclosure must
first be measured.
To avoid environmental perturbations, the measurements must be performed in a
shielded enclosure, preserved from electromagnetic disturbances coming from
electromagnetic environment (Radio and TV broadcast, cellular, ISM equipment,
etc...). It's recommended to test the chamber's shielding effectiveness
according to the EN 50 147-1 standard in the frequency range of 700 MHz up to
4 GHz.
The recommended level of the shielding effectiveness is -100 dB from 700 MHz
to 4 GHz.
# G.2 Reverberation chamber statistical ripple and repeatability validation
The reverberation chamber is typically evaluated according to its isotropy
level and ability to produce independent samples. The uncertainty due to
chamber statistics is determined by repeated calibration measurements as
described in Annex B.2. This uncertainty contribution is a composite value
consisting of most of the specific reverberation chamber contributions, such
as limited number of modes, K-factor, polarization imbalance and mode-stirring
techniques.
The uncertainty contribution value shall be determined by repeated calibration
measurements for nine different positions and orientations of the calibration
antenna in order to determine the statistical variation as a function of
frequency, or at least at the frequencies where the chamber shall be used.
This uncertainty contribution value can be assumed to have a normal
distribution.
The uncertainty will depend on chamber size, frequency, stirrer sequence,
stirrer types and shapes, polarization stirring (if any), and the degree of
chamber loading. All these factors must remain the same for all nine
calibration measurements. The uncertainty will also depend on frequency
stirring bandwidth (if any), but the effects of different amounts of frequency
stirring can be studied with the same sets of calibration data as when no
frequency stirring is applied.
The nine net average power transfer functions of all or some of the nine
calibration configurations for each loading case shall be averaged to provide
a good reference level. Frequency stirring can only be applied to improve the
reference level. Therefore, the uncertainty shall be found by computing the
average and standard deviation of the net average power transfer function of
each of the nine reference (antenna) positions and orientations (without
frequency stirring) around the reference level (which can be frequency stirred
if it gives better overall accuracy).
The data obtained during these reference measurements can be used for analysis
of the chamber's systematic and deterministic contribution to S21. Such
analysis can help determine possible uncertainty sources in chambers where the
"chamber statistics" portion of the uncertainty analysis is too high to fulfil
the total uncertainty criterion. The normalized standard deviation is
calculated using the following expression:
where
is the standard deviation of the power transfer function over T different
calibration antenna positions. $P_{\text{ref},t}$ is the reference power
transfer function for position _t_ of the calibration antenna. The power
transfer function for every calibration antenna position is further the
average over the power transfer function $P_{\text{ref},t,n}$ for each fixed
measurement antenna in the chamber defined in Annex B.2. Thus,
where _N_ is the total number of fixed measurement antennas. Moreover,
This is the average power transfer function over the _T_ calibration
positions.
###### ## Annex H (informative): Dielectric Property Measurements of Hand
Phantoms
This annex describes the measurement of the dielectric properties of tissue-
equivalent material of hand phantom. The phantoms are commonly based on a
carbon-filled silicone rubber material. Besides relative permittivity and
conductivity, the carbon-loaded polymer matrix materials used for making hand
phantoms have other properties which must be carefully controlled, most
notably DC resistance and stiffness. In carbon-loaded materials with
increasing carbon concentrations, a point is reached, the percolation point,
at which the particles are no longer completely isolated and the DC resistance
of the entire macroscopic sample drops suddenly.
Measurements of permittivity and conductivity on materials around this carbon
concentration need careful procedures. An additional issue is that in solids
with suspended particles, natural surfaces represent a unique plane, and may
contain a much-reduced particle loading compared to any other sectional plane
through the solid, where particles will intersect the plane. Cutting such
material may result in release of a carbon film that may also strongly affect
the measurements.
The open-ended coaxial probe (OCP) technique has demonstrated an acceptable
degree of consistency between labs, even around the percolation point.
Moreover, the published target dielectric properties [75] for hand materials
were derived from open-ended probe measurements on a sample of human hands.
The OCP method shall be used for all surface dielectric property measurements.
The dielectric parameters to be determined are the complex relative
permittivity {width="0.9479166666666666in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} of
the material. It is recommended that with each delivered hand, manufacturers
will provide two test samples of the material made from the same mix as the
hand, one to be kept by the user, and the other
by the manufacturer.
# H.1 Open-ended Coaxial Probe (OCP) Method
Compressibility of the hand materials is a property that must be considered
when measurements are made with OPC method. The degree to which the coaxial
sensor is pressed into the surface of the test sample has a significant effect
on the results obtained. Sensors with a nominal diameter of at least 7 mm are
to be preferred over smaller ones in this respect. A cylindrical sample-under-
test, such as can be provided by molding inside a 20 ml plastic syringe,
alleviates the concern that might exist with a flat block that probe pressure
causes the material directly under the probe tip to bow away from contact. To
obtain measurement consistency, the sensor can be supported on a framework
that allows measurement either at a fixed contact pressure or at a fixed
sensor displacement. In both cases, as contact is increased from a light
touch, the dielectric results change, but above a certain critical
pressure/penetration, stable results are obtained. Measurements shall be made
in this condition. A pressure of around 500 kPa is necessary for this
condition to be met, or a displacement of 3 mm. 500 kPa is equivalent to a
load of 2 kg on a nominal 7 mm diameter probe. Measurement at a fixed sensor
displacement offers a considerable advantage over the fixed pressure technique
by providing, at the same time, a simple measurement of the elastic modulus of
the material-under-test.

{width="3.745833333333333in" height="2.667361111111111in"}
Figure H.2. OCP setup with fixed contact pressure.
Measurements are made by placing the probe in contact with the sample and
measuring the admittance or reflection coefficient with respect to the open-
circuit end, using network analyzer or equivalent instrumentation. To reduce
measurement uncertainty, it is recommended that the measurement be repeated at
least 10 times at different positions on the test sample, to minimize bias
from abnormal readings caused by particulates of the same scale size as the
probe dimension.
Prior to measurements, the network analyzer is configured to measure the
magnitude and phase of the admittance. A one-port reflection calibration is
performed at the plane of the probe by placing liquids for which the
reflection coefficient can be calculated in contact with the probe. Three
standards are needed for the calibration, typically a short circuit, air, and
de-ionized water at a well-defined temperature (other reference liquids such
as methanol or ethanol may be used for calibration).
Application software should interpret the measured data to yield the
dielectric properties of the sample as a function of frequency, together with
an estimate of the standard deviation. To use this technique, a probe and a
software package for the network analyzer has to be developed or obtained from
a commercial source.
