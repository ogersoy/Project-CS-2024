# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
**Iu Timing Interval (ITI):** Iu Timing Interval is the minimum time interval
between sent Iu UP PDUs for a specific RAB. The ITI can be calculated for
conversational and streaming traffic classes by the following formula:
{width="1.1416666666666666in" height="0.3548611111111111in"}
**Inter PDU Transmission Interval (IPTI):** inter PDU Transmission Interval is
the actual interval at which Iu UP PDUs can be sent at a certain time for a
specific RAB subflow combination. The IPTI of a RAB subflow combination is
calculated based on the RAB subflow combination size and the RAB subflow
combination bitrate by dividing the RAB subflow combination size with the RAB
subflow combination bitrate.
{width="4.361111111111111in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
NOTE: If RFC_Bitrate is not defined then IPTI=ITI. If RFC_size is not defined
then RFC_size=MaxSDUsize.
**Non Access Stratum (NAS) Data Streams:** non Access Stratum Data Streams is
a generic term to identify these data streams exchanged at the Dedicated
Service Access Points between the Non Access Stratum and the Access Stratum.
**RAB sub-flows:** RAB as defined in TR 21.905 [9] is realised by UTRAN
through one to several sub-flows. These sub-flows correspond to the NAS
service data streams that have QoS characteristics that differ in a predefined
manner within a RAB e.g. different reliability classes.
**RAB sub-flows characteristics:**
1) the sub-flows of a RAB are established and released together at the RAB
establishment and release, respectively;
2) the sub-flows of a RAB are submitted and delivered together at the RAB SAP;
3) the sub-flows of a RAB are carried over the same Iu transmission
connection;
4) the sub-flows of a RAB are organised in a predefined manner at the RAB SAP
and over the Iu interface. The organisation is imposed by the NAS as part of
its co-ordination responsibility.
**RAB sub-flows numbering (applies to support mode for predefined SDU size
only):**
1) RAB sub-flows are numbered from 1 to N (N is the number of sub-flows);
2) RAB sub-flow number 1 corresponds to the highest reliability class and the
RAB sub-flow number N corresponds to the lowest reliability class;
3) RAB sub-flows order inside the Iu frame is predefined so that RAB sub-flow
number one comes first and the RAB sub-flow number N comes last.
**RAB sub-Flow Combination (RFC):** RAB sub-flow combination is defined as an
authorised combination of the RAB sub-flows variable attributes (e.g. SDU
sizes) of currently valid RAB sub-flows that can be submitted simultaneously
to the Iu UP for transmission over Iu interface. Each combination is given by
the CN and cannot be altered by the SRNC.
**RAB sub-Flow Combination Indicator (RFCI):** this indicator uniquely
identifies a RAB sub-flow combination for the duration of the Iu UP peer
protocol instances i.e. it is valid until the termination of the call or until
a new initialisation is performed. Usage of RFCI applies only to Iu UP
protocol operated in support mode for predefined SDU size.
**Principles related to RFCI allocation and Initialisation procedure:**
1) RFCI value is present in every Iu user frame;
2) in the Initialisation procedure in Iu UP, the size of every RAB sub-flow
SDU for each RFCI is signalled.
**Syntactical error:** field is defined to be syntactically incorrect in a
frame if it contains at least one value defined as \"reserved\", or if its
value part violates syntactic rules given in the specification of the value
part. However it is not a syntactical error that a value specified as
\"spare\" is being used.
**Semantical error:** A frame is defined to have semantically incorrect
contents if it contains information which, possibly dependant on the state of
the receiver, is in contradiction to the resources of the receiver and/or to
the procedural part.

## 3.3 Concepts
**Iu UP mode of operation:**
One objective of the Iu User Plane (UP) protocol is to remain independent of
the CN domain (Circuit Switched or Packet Switched) and to have limited or no
dependency with the Transport Network Layer. Meeting this objective provides
the flexibility to evolve services regardless of the CN domain and to migrate
services across CN domains.
The Iu UP protocol is therefore defined with modes of operation that can be
activated on a RAB basis rather than on a CN domain basis or (tele) service
basis. The Iu UP mode of operation determines if and which set of features
shall be provided to meet e.g. the RAB QoS requirements.
**Iu UP protocol PDU Type:**
The Iu UP protocol PDU Types are defined for a given Iu UP mode of operation.
An Iu UP PDU Type represents a defined structure of an Iu UP protocol frame.
For instance, a frame made of a certain Frame Header mask part and a Frame
Payload part would be specified as a certain PDU type valid for a given Iu UP
mode of operation.
**Tandem Free Operation (TFO):**
Configuration of a Speech or Multimedia call for which Transcoders are
physically present in the communication path but transcoding functions are
disabled or partially disabled. The Transcoders may perform control and/or
protocol conversion functions.
**Transcoder (TC):**
Physical device present in the network responsible for the transcoding of the
speech data between two speech codecs or coding schemes (The Transcoder may
also include other functions, i.e. Rate Adaptation in GSM).
**Transcoder Free Operation (TrFO):**
Configuration of a Speech or Multimedia call for which Transcoders are not
present in the communication path.

# 4 General
## 4.1 General aspects
The Iu UP protocol is located in the User plane of the Radio Network layer
over the Iu interface: the Iu UP protocol layer.
The Iu UP protocol is used to convey user data associated to Radio Access
Bearers.
One Iu UP protocol instance is associated to one RAB and one RAB only. If
several RABs are established towards one given UE, then these RABs make use of
several Iu UP protocol instances.
In general, Iu UP protocol instances exist at Iu access point as defined in TS
25.410 [2] i.e. at CN and UTRAN. However, as described in TS 23.153 [13], if
TrFO is possible and the Iu UP protocol instances operate in support mode the
Iu UP protocol instance in CN may resume performing Iu UP specific functions
or vanish completely during stable call states. In this case the partner peer
entity actually interacting with the UTRAN Iu UP protocol instance (i.e.
performing all Iu UP specific functions except UP initialisation) may either
be located within another UTRAN or within a CN node that is not the serving CN
node of the UTRAN.
Whenever a RAB requires transfer of user data in the Iu UP, an Iu UP protocol
instance exists at each Iu interface access points. These Iu UP protocol
instances are established, relocated and release together with the associated
RAB.
Whether these peer protocol instances perform some RAB related function
depends on the mode of operation of the Iu UP as defined below.
The following figure illustrates the logical placement of the Iu UP protocol
layer and the placement of the Data Streams sources outside of the Access
Stratum.
{width="4.540277777777778in" height="2.629861111111111in"}

Plane View)
## 4.2 Operational and Functional Aspects
### 4.2.1 Iu UP protocol modes of operation
The Iu UP protocol operates in mode according to the concept described in
earlier subclause.
Modes of operation of the protocol are defined:
1) Transparent mode (TrM);
2) Support mode for predefined SDU size (SMpSDU).
Determination of the Iu UP protocol instance mode of operation is a CN
decision taken at RAB establishment based on e.g. the RAB characteristics. It
is signalled in the Radio Network layer control plane at RAB assignment and
relocation for each RAB. It is internally indicated to the Iu UP protocol
layer at user plane establishment.
The choice of a mode is bound to the nature of the associated RAB and cannot
be changed unless the RAB is changed.
### 4.2.2 Transparent mode (TrM)
The transparent mode is intended for those RABs that do not require any
particular feature from the Iu UP protocol other than transfer of user data.
The following figure illustrates the transparent mode of operation of the Iu
UP protocol layer.
{width="3.6166666666666667in" height="3.341666666666667in"}
Figure 2: Iu UP protocol layer in transparent occurrence over Iu interface
In this mode, the Iu UP protocol instance does not perform any Iu UP protocol
information exchange with its peer over the Iu interface: no Iu frame is sent.
The Iu UP protocol layer is crossed through by PDUs being exchanged between
upper layers and transport network layer.
For instance, the transfer of GTP-U PDUs could utilise the transparent mode of
the Iu UP protocol.
This release of the specification defines transparent mode version 1, the same
as in the release 99 specification.
### 4.2.3 Support mode
The support modes are intended for those RABs that do require particular
features from the Iu UP protocol in addition to transfer of user data. When
operating in a support mode, the peer Iu UP protocol instances exchange Iu UP
frames whereas in transparent mode, no Iu UP frames are generated.
The following figure illustrates the functional model of the Iu UP protocol
layer in support mode of operation.
{width="3.6166666666666667in" height="3.341666666666667in"}
Figure 3: Iu UP protocol layer in support mode occurrence over Iu interface
Some RABs requesting Iu UP protocol support, constrain the Iu UP protocol and
possibly the radio interface protocols in specific ways. For instance, certain
RABs can have variable predefined rates.
The Iu UP support mode is prepared to support variations.
The only support mode defined here is the:
\- Support mode for predefined SDU size (SMpSDU).
For instance, the transfer of AMR speech PDUs would utilise the support mode
for predefined SDU size of the Iu UP protocol because it requires some
Procedure Control functions and some NAS Data Streams specific functions while
the sizes of the user data being transferred can vary in a predefined manner.
This release of the specification defines the Support mode for predefined SDU
sizes version 2. The Support mode for predefined SDU sizes version 1 (see
release 99 of this specification) shall also be supported by a 3GPP
implementation compliant to this release of the specification in order to be
backward compatible with release 99.
# 5 Transparent mode, version 1
## 5.1 General
### 5.1.1 Operation of the Iu UP in Transparent mode
The Iu UP layer in transparent mode is present in the Iu User plane for
transferring data transparently over the Iu interface.
The two strata communicate through a Service Access Point for Non Access
Stratum (NAS) Data Streams transfer.
### 5.1.2 Interfaces of the Iu UP protocol layer in Transparent mode
Interfaces of the Iu UP protocol layer in transparent mode are the transport
network layer and the upper layers. The Iu UP protocol layer in transparent
mode is an empty layer through which NAS Data Streams PDUs are crossing
between the Transport Network Layer and upper layers.
The Iu UP protocol layer in transparent mode is using services of the
Transport layers in order to transfer the Iu UP PDUs over the Iu interface.
## 5.2 Iu UP Protocol layer Services in Transparent mode
The following functions are needed to support this mode:
\- Transfer of user data.
## 5.3 Services Expected from the UP Data Transport layer
The Iu UP protocol layer in transparent mode expects the following services
from the Transport Network Layer:
\- Transfer of user data.
\- Delivery of SDUs in sequence when requested by the RAB parameter _Delivery_
_Order_ IE (TS 25.413 [3]).
## 5.4 Elements for Iu UP communication in Transparent mode
### 5.4.1 Frame Format for transparent mode
The following shows the format of the PDU crossing the Iu UP protocol layer in
transparent mode. This frame is transferred transparently between the Iu UP
protocol upper layers and transport network layer (TNL-SAP).
{width="3.4270833333333335in" height="1.8368055555555556in"}
Figure 4: Frame format for transparent mode
This PDU has a variable length of n octets, whose maximum range depends on the
type of user data (e.g. IP packet). No explicit length indication is visible
at the Iu UP protocol layer.
# 6 Support mode for predefined SDU sizes, version 2
## 6.1 General
### 6.1.1 Operation of the Iu UP in Support mode
The Iu UP protocol layer in Support mode is present for data streams that need
frame handling in the UP.
The two strata communicate through a Service Access Point for Non Access
Stratum (NAS) Data Streams transfer.
### 6.1.2 Interfaces of the Iu UP protocol layer in Support mode
As part of the Access Stratum responsibility, the Iu UP protocol layer in
support mode provides the services and functions that are necessary to handle
non access stratum data streams. The Iu UP protocol layer in support mode is
providing these services to the UP upper layers through a Dedicated Service
Access Point used for Information Transfer as specified in TS 23.110 [5].
The Iu UP protocol layer in support mode is using services of the Transport
layers in order to transfer the Iu UP PDUs over the Iu interface.
## 6.2 Iu UP Protocol layer Services in Support mode
Support mode for predefined SDU size Service
The following functions are needed to support this mode:
\- Transfer of user data;
\- Initialisation;
\- Rate control;
\- Time alignment;
\- Handling of error event;
\- Frame quality classification.
## 6.3 Services Expected from the UP Data Transport layer
The Iu UP protocol layer in Support Mode expects the following services from
the Transport Network Layer:
\- Transfer of user data.
\- Delivery of SDUs in sequence when requested by the RAB parameter _Delivery
Order_ IE (TS 25.413 [3]).
## 6.4 Functions of the Iu UP Protocol Layer in Support mode
### 6.4.1 Functional model of the Iu UP Protocol Layer in Support mode
{width="3.6166666666666667in" height="3.341666666666667in"}
Figure 5: Functional model of the Iu UP protocol layer in Support mode
The Iu UP protocol layer in Support mode is made of three sets of functions:
1) Frame Handler function;
2) Procedure Control functions;
3) Non Access Stratum Data Streams specific functions.
### 6.4.2 Frame Handler function
This function is responsible for framing and de-framing the different parts of
an Iu UP protocol frame. This function takes the different parts of the Iu UP
protocol frame and set the control part field to the correct values, including
the handling of the frame number. It also ensures that the frame control part
is semantically correct. This function is responsible for interacting with the
Transport layers. This function is also responsible for the CRC check of the
Iu UP frame header. The Iu UP frame with header CRC check error is discarded.
### 6.4.3 Procedure Control functions
This set of functions offers the control of a number of procedures handled at
the Iu UP protocol level. These functions are responsible for the procedure
control part of the Iu UP frames.
Namely, these procedures are:
**\- Rate Control:** is the procedure which controls over the Iu UP the
maximum rate that is allowed to be sent downlink among the rates that can be
controlled. The set of rates is represented by RFCI indicators. The function
controlling this procedure interacts with functions outside of the Iu UP
protocol layer.
**\- Initialisation:** is the procedure which controls the exchange of
initialisation information that is required for operation in support mode for
predefined SDU size. Such information can contain the RFCI Set to be used
until termination of the connection or until the next Initialisation
procedure. This procedure is also used for negotiating the version of the Iu
UP Mode among the versions the CN requested for the related RAB.
**\- Time Alignment:** is the procedure that controls the timing of the
downlink data to the RNC over Iu. The function controlling this procedure
interacts with functions outside of the Iu UP protocol layer.
**\- Handling of Error Event:** is the procedure that controls the information
exchanged over the Iu related to detection of a fault situation. The function
controlling this procedure interacts with functions outside of the Iu UP
protocol layer.
### 6.4.4 Non Access Stratum Data Streams specific function(s)
These functions are responsible for a \"limited manipulation\" of the payload.
These functions are responsible for the CRC check and calculation of the Iu UP
frame payload part. These functions are also responsible for the Frame Quality
Classification handling as described below.
These functions interact with the upper layers by exchanging Iu data stream
blocks of Iu UP frame payload. These functions also handle the padding and
depadding of the Iu UP frame payloads when needed.
These functions interact with the Procedure Control functions.
These functions provide service access to the upper layers for the Procedure
Control functions.
#### 6.4.4.1 Frame Quality Classification function
##### 6.4.4.1.1 General
On the Iu UP in Support Mode the frames are classified with the Frame Quality
Classifier (FQC). This classifying is based on the radio frame classification
and the setting of the RAB attribute _Delivery of erroneous SDU_ IE. The RAB
attribute _Delivery of erroneous SDU_ IE tells if erroneous frames shall be
delivered or not.
Figure 6 shows the main input and output information for frame quality
classification function on the Iu UP.
{width="4.123611111111111in" height="3.477777777777778in"}
Figure 6: Frame quality classification in Iu UP
##### 6.4.4.1.2 Handling of FQC information in uplink path
##### 6.4.4.1.2.1 Handling of FQC information at RNC {#handling-of-fqc-
information-at-rnc .H6}
In SRNC on the sending side, the Support Mode Functions takes as input the
radio frame quality information together with the frame. Based on this, the
_Frame Quality Classification (FQC)_ IE is set for the frame, a CRC is or is
not added (depending on PDU type) and the frame is sent to CN. The following
steps shall be sequentially applied to derive the SRNC behaviour and the
_Frame Quality Classification (FQC)_ IE setting:
a) If there is at least one subflow with the _Delivery of erroneous SDU_ IE
set to \"No\" and for at least one of those subflows the radio frame
classification is \"Bad\" then the Iu UP frame shall not be sent;
b) Otherwise, if there is at least one subflow with the _Delivery of erroneous
SDU_ IE set to \"Yes\" and for at least one of those subflows the radio frame
classification is \"Bad\" then the Iu UP frame shall be sent with _Frame
Quality Classification (FQC)_ IE set to \"frame bad due to radio\";
c) Otherwise the Iu UP frame shall be sent with _Frame Quality Classification
(FQC)_ IE set to \"frame good\".
##### 6.4.4.1.2.2 Handling of FQC information at CN {#handling-of-fqc-
information-at-cn .H6}
The Support Mode Functions in CN on the receiving side makes a CRC check of
the frame payload, if CRC is present and passes the appropriate frame and the
appropriate frame quality classification information through the RNL-SAP. The
following steps shall be sequentially applied to derive the CN behaviour and
the FQC field setting:
a) If a CRC is available and the CRC check indicates that the Iu UP frame
payload part is corrupted and at least one subflow has the _Delivery of
erroneous SDU_ IE set to \"No\", then the Iu UP frame shall be dropped;
b) Otherwise, if a CRC is available and the CRC check indicates that the Iu UP
frame payload part is corrupted and at least one subflow has the _Delivery of
erroneous SDU_ IE set to \"Yes\", then the Iu UP frame shall be forwarded with
the FQC set to \"frame bad\";
c) Otherwise the Iu UP frame shall be forwarded with the FQC as set by UTRAN.
##### 6.4.4.1.3 Handling of FQC information in downlink path
The Support Mode Functions in CN on the sending side adds a CRC, if necessary
to the frame payload and passes it together with the FQC. If the payload stems
from a transcoding unit of the NAS within the CN the FQC is always set to
\"frame good\". Otherwise it may be set by a partner peer entity residing in
another RNC.
The Support Mode Functions in SRNC then makes a CRC-check, if the CRC is
present. Based on the CRC check, a decision is made whether to deliver the
frame or not based on the following sequential steps:
a) If a CRC is available and the CRC check indicates that the Iu UP frame
payload part is corrupted then the frame shall be dropped;
b) Otherwise, if the FQC value of the Iu UP frame is set to \"frame bad\" or
\"frame bad due to radio\" then the frame shall be dropped, regardless of the
CRC check indication;
c) Otherwise, the frame shall be passed to radio interface protocols.
NOTE: The case where SRNC receives a frame with the FQC set to \"frame bad due
to radio\" (respectively: \"frame bad\"), corresponds to a TrFO (respectively:
TFO) case. The frame is then trashed by the receiving RNC since there is
currently no means to pass the frame quality indicator down to the UE.
## 6.5 Elementary procedures
### 6.5.1 Transfer of User Data procedure
#### 6.5.1.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of User Data procedure is to transfer Iu UP frames
between the two Iu UP protocol layers at both ends of the Iu interface. Since
an Iu UP instance is associated to a RAB and a RAB only, the user data being
transferred only relate to the associated RAB.
The procedure is controlled at both ends of the Iu UP instance i.e. SRNC and
the CN. Exceptions in case of TrFO, where the partner peer entity does not
reside within the serving CN node are described in subclause 4.1 and TS 23.153
[13].
The Transfer of User Data procedure is invoked whenever user data for that
particular RAB needs to be sent across the Iu interface.
The procedure is invoked by the Iu UP upper layers upon reception of the upper
layer PDU and associated control information: RFCI.
The upper layers may deliver a frame quality classification information
together with the RFCI.
The NAS Data Streams specific functions makes the padding of the payload (if
needed) so that the Iu UP frame payload will be an integer number of octets.
Then the NAS Data Streams specific functions perform, if needed, CRC
calculation of the Iu frame payload and passes the Iu UP frame payload down to
the Frame Handler function together with the RFCI.
The Frame Handler function retrieves the frame number from its internal
memory, formats the frame header and frame payload into the appropriate PDU
Type and sends the Iu UP frame PDU to the lower layers for transfer across the
Iu interface. If the UTRAN initialises the RAB it shall base the selection of
the PDU type (in both directions) on the reliability attributes (see TS 25.413
[3]) for the RAB. If the reliability attribute _Delivery of Erroneous SDU_ IE
equals \"no-error-detection-consideration\" for all subflows then PDU Type 1
shall be used, otherwise PDU Type 0 shall be used.
For RABs with the traffic class conversational or streaming the frame number
shall be based on time (stepped at each ITI). For RABs with another type of
traffic class the frame numbering shall be based on sent Iu UP PDU (stepped at
each sent Iu UP PDU). See description of _Frame Number_ IE.
Upon reception of a user data frame, the Iu UP protocol layer checks the
consistency of the Iu UP frame as follows:
\- The Frame Handler function checks the consistency of the frame header and
the consistency of the frame number. If a frame loss is detected due a gap in
the sequence of the received frame numbers (for a RAB where frame numbers does
not relate to time), this shall be reported to the Procedure Control function.
If correct, the Frame Handler function stores the frame number and passes the
Iu UP frame payload and associated CRC, if any to the NAS Data Streams
specific functions. The received RFCI is passed to the Procedure Control
function;
\- The NAS Data Streams specific functions check the payload CRC, if any. If
the RFCI is correct (i.e. RFCI is used at Initialisation) and matches the Iu
UP frame payload (i.e. frame payload is not too short for the RFCI) as
indicated by the Procedure Control functions, the NAS Data Streams specific
functions removes the padding bits and the spare extension field when present
from the Iu UP frame payload based on the RFCI information. Then the NAS Data
Streams specific functions forwards to the upper layers the RFCI and the
payload.
Figure 7: Successful Transfers of User Data
#### 6.5.1.2 Unsuccessful operation
If the Iu UP frame carrying the user data is incorrectly formatted or cannot
be correctly treated by the receiving Iu UP protocol layer, the Iu UP protocol
layer shall either discard the frame or pass it to the upper layers with a
frame classification indicating a corrupted frame. This decision is based on
configuration data of the Iu UP instance for that particular RAB (i.e. if the
RAB requests delivery of corrupted frame).
If the Iu UP protocol layer detects a frame loss because of a gap in the
received frame number sequence while the frame number does not relate to time
(see description of _Frame Number_ IE), the receiving Iu UP protocol layer
shall report this to the Procedure Control function.
Figure 8: Unsuccessful Transfers of User Data: 1) Corrupted Frame, 2)
Detection of Frame loss
### 6.5.2 Initialisation procedure
#### 6.5.2.1 Successful operation
This procedure is mandatory for RABs using the support mode for predefined SDU
size. The purpose of the Initialisation procedure is to configure both
termination points of the Iu UP with RAB Subflows Combinations, RFCIs, and
associated RAB Sub Flows SDU sizes necessary to be supported during the
transfer of user data phase.
Additional parameters may also be passed, such as the Inter PDU Timing
Interval (IPTI) information.
The Initialisation procedure may be controlled at both end of the Iu access
point, i.e. the CN and UTRAN.
The Initialisation procedure is invoked whenever indicated by the Iu UP
Procedure Control function e.g. as a result of a relocation of SRNS or at RAB
establishment over Iu or if the CN decides to resolve RFCI mismatch in case of
TrFO (see TS 23.153 [13]). The Initialisation procedure shall not be re-
invoked by the SRNC for the RAB without a RAB modification requested via RANAP
(TS 25.413 [3]).
When this procedure is invoked all other Iu UP procedures are suspended until
termination of the Initialisation procedure.
The Iu UP protocol entity invoking this procedure shall indicate the Iu UP
Mode version of the INITIALISATION control frame it uses in the Iu UP Mode
Version field. It shall also indicate the Iu UP Mode versions it proposes
among the versions the CN requested for the related RAB and which it supports
in the Iu UP Mode Versions Supported field. The sender should use the lowest
Iu UP Mode version for the initialisation that has enough information to
initialise the highest proposed protocol version.
The invoking entity allocates a RAB sub-Flow Combination indicator (RFCI) to
each RAB sub-Flow Combination it initialises. One requirement on which RAB
sub-Flow Combinations to initialise, is that all requested compound RAB sub-
Flow Combination SDU sizes shall be configured, except in the case when also
version 1 of the user plane mode was included as an alternative in the request
over RANAP. In that case, it is allowed to initialise just a subset of the
requested RAB sub-Flow Combinations, however at least one of the requested RAB
sub-Flow Combinations equal or above the guaranteed bitrate shall be
initialised. The association of indicators to RAB Flow Combinations is valid
for both the uplink and downlink direction in the Iu UP until a new
Initialisation procedure is performed or the connection is terminated.
The Procedure Control function may also generate additional Iu UP protocol
parameters necessary for the RAB service to operate properly over Iu.
To each RAB sub-Flow combination indicator is associated the size of each RAB
sub-Flow SDU of that combination. The list of RAB sub-Flow Combination
Indicators and their respective SDU sizes constitutes the RAB sub-Flow
Combination set passed over the Iu UP in the INITIALISATION control frame i.e.
into an appropriate Iu UP PDU Type.
The first RAB Sub-flow Combination proposed in the list of RAB Sub-Flow
Combinations corresponds to the maximum bit rate allowed to be used when
starting the communication phase i.e. until the first RATE CONTROL control
frame occurs. The RAB Sub-flow Combinations for rates below the guaranteed bit
rate as specified in the RAB parameters (indicated to the Iu-UP at the RNC)
shall not be used as the first RAB Sub-flow Combination in the proposed list
of RAB Sub-Flow Combinations.
Any RAB Sub-Flow Combination of the set that is initialised shall be supported
by the two Iu UP termination points and may optionally be used by the sender
(except for the first in the list that shall be used when starting). In
particular, the use by the sender of the RFC \"NO_DATA\" is optional even when
it is included in the Initialisation procedure.
Conversely, any RAB Sub-Flow Combination that is not part of the initialised
set shall not be used even if supported. In particular, the two Iu UP
termination points shall be capable of operating without the use of the RFC
\"NO_DATA\".
The complete set of information is framed by the Iu UP Frame Handler function
and transferred in an Iu UP INITIALISATION control frame. If needed, the
INITIALISATION control frame CRC is calculated and set accordingly in the
respective frame field.
A supervision timer T ~INIT~ is started after sending the Iu UP INITIALISATION
control frame. This timer supervises the reception of the initialisation
acknowledgement frame.
Upon reception of a frame indicating that an Initialisation procedure is
active in the peer Iu UP entity, the Iu UP protocol layer forwards the whole
protocol information contained in the INITIALISATION control frame to the
upper layers. It also stores the RAB sub-Flow Combination set (and thus
replaces a possible previous set) in order to control during the transfer of
user data, that the Iu UP payload is correctly formatted (e.g. RFCI matches
the expected Iu UP frame payload total length). The peer Iu UP entity
receiving the INITIALISATION control frame shall choose a version that it
supports among the proposed versions indicated by the sender for which it has
enough initialisation information.
If the INITIALISATION control frame is correctly formatted and treated by the
receiving Iu UP protocol layer, and at least one of the proposed versions is
supported, this latter sends an INITIALISATION POSITIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT frame
using the version of the Iu UP Mode that is chosen.
Upon reception of an initialisation acknowledgement frame, the Iu UP protocol
layer in the SRNC stops the supervision timer T~INIT~.
If the Initialisation procedure requires that several frames are to be sent,
each frame shall be acknowledged individually (i.e. any frame to be sent shall
wait for the acknowledgement of the previous sent frame to be received before
being sent. The supervision timer shall be used individually for each frame
being sent.
The successful operation of the Initialisation procedure may require that one
or several chained frames are positively acknowledged. The number of
INITIALISATION control frames in such a chain shall not exceed 4\. Each
chained frame shall be positively acknowledged before the one with the next
frame number can be sent.
The _PDU Type 14 Frame Number_ IE of an INITIALISATION control frame shall
always be set to \"0\" when the chain has only one frame. When several
INITIALISATION control frames are used in a chain the _PDU Type 14 Frame
Number_ IE shall be set to \"0\" for the first one and incremented by one in
the sending direction for each new frame in the chain. The positive
acknowledgement or negative acknowledgement shall carry the frame number of
the frame being acknowledged.
Upon reception of an INITIALISATION NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT control frame, an
erroneous acknowledgement or at timer T ~INIT~ expiry, the Iu UP protocol
entity controlling the Initialisation procedure shall reset and restart the T
~INIT~ supervision timer and repeat one INITIALISATION control frame with the
same frame number. The repetition shall be performed up to N ~INIT~ times, N
~INIT~ being chosen by the operator (default N ~INIT~ = 3). The N ~INIT~
(maximum number of allowed repetition) is the aggregate count for each frame
in the chain and is restart each time a frame is positively acknowledged.
Figure 9: Successful Initialisation of Iu UP for m RFCIs
#### 6.5.2.2 Unsuccessful operation
If the INITIALISATION control frame is incorrectly formatted and cannot be
correctly treated by the receiving Iu UP protocol layer, this latter sends an
INITIALISATION NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT control frame.
If the receiver does not support the Iu UP Mode version used for the
Initialisation procedure, it shall send a negative acknowledgement using the
highest version it supports among the versions proposed by the sender. If none
of the proposed versions are supported, the receiver shall respond with a
negative acknowledgement using the highest version it supports.
After N ~INIT~ successive negative acknowledgment, erroneous acknowledgment or
T ~INIT~ expiry for INITIALISATION control frames having the same frame
number, the Initialisation procedure is unsuccessfully terminated and the Iu
UP protocol layers in RNC take appropriate local actions.

acknowledgement\ or 2) N ~INIT~ expiries of timer T~INIT~
### 6.5.3 Iu Rate Control procedure
#### 6.5.3.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Iu Rate Control procedure is to signal to the peer Iu UP
protocol layer the maximum rate over Iu in the reverse direction of the sent
RATE CONTROL control frame.
The Rate Control procedure over Iu UP is normally controlled by the entity
controlling the rate control over UTRAN i.e. the SRNC. The Iu Rate Control
procedure is invoked whenever the SRNC decides that the maximum rate permitted
downlink over Iu shall be modified, or when a RATE CONTROL control frame is
received from the CN. Within the context of TrFO the SRNC may also receive
RATE CONTROL control frames from the TrFO partner.
The rates that can be controlled by the SRNC are all the rates that are
defined by the Iu-Initialisation procedure and which are above the guaranteed
bitrate specified in the RAB parameters (indicated to the Iu UP at the RNC).
Rates below or equal to the guaranteed bitrate, e.g. the lowest speech rate or
the SID frames, cannot be controlled (i.e. cannot be forbidden) by the SRNC
(exceptionally, in case of version 1 any of the initialised rates equal to or
above the guaranteed bitrate can be controlled).
The procedure can be signalled at any time when Transfer of User Data
procedure is not suspended by another Procedure Control function. When the
user plane was initiated due to SRNS relocation reasons no rate control shall
be signalled before the reception of the relocation execution trigger (see TS
25.413 [3]). At the reception of the relocation execution trigger the RNC
shall start the Iu Rate Control procedure. This enables both TrFO partners to
exchange current maximum rates and proceed user data transport based on latest
rate decisions.
The Procedure Control function upon request of upper layer prepares the RATE
CONTROL control frame payload containing the maximum rate of the reverse
direction of the RATE CONTROL control frame. To align the Iu Rate Control
procedure with version 1 of the Iu UP protocol the permitted maximum rate is
given as a set of RFCI indicators, that shall contain the maximum rate and all
rates below the maximum rate, i.e. all rate controllable and non rate
controllable rates. In the context of TrFO and TFO the Iu Rate Control
procedure may also be controlled by a remote peer.
The Frame Handler function calculates the frame CRC, formats the frame header
into the appropriate PDU Type and sends the Iu UP frame PDU to the lower
layers for transfer across the Iu interface.
A supervision timer T~RC~ is started after sending the Iu UP RATE CONTROL
control frame. This timer supervises the reception of the rate control
acknowledgement frame. Upon reception of a rate control acknowledgement frame,
the Iu UP protocol layer in the SRNC stops the supervision timer T~RC~.
Upon reception of a RATE CONTROL control frame, the Iu UP protocol layer
checks the consistency of the Iu UP frame as follows:
\- The Frame Handler function checks the consistency of the frame header and
associated CRC. If correct, the Frame Handler function passes Procedure
Control part to the procedure control functions;
\- The Procedure Control functions check that all RFCIs in the initial RFCI
set are indicated as either allowed or barred. If the whole rate control
information is correct, the Procedure Control functions passes the rate
control information to the NAS Data Streams specific functions;
\- The NAS Data Streams specific functions forward to the upper layers the
complete protocol data in a Iu-UP-Status indication primitive;
\- Upon reception of the Iu-UP-Status request primitive, the Procedure Control
functions shall acknowledge the RATE CONTROL control frame by including its
own maximum rate control information i.e. the permitted rates in the reverse
direction of the RATE CONTROL ACK message.
Figure 11: Successful Rate Control
Figure 12: Void
#### 6.5.3.2 Unsuccessful operation
If the Iu UP protocol layer receives a RATE CONTROL control frame that is
badly formatted or corrupted, it shall ignore the RATE CONTROL control frame,
but send a RATE CONTROL NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT control frame back (figure
13a).
Figure 13a: Negative Acknowledgement received from the peer
If the Iu UP in the SRNC detects that the RATE CONTROL control frame has not
been correctly interpreted or received (e.g. the observed rate is outside the
set of permitted rates in the reverse direction of the RATE CONTROL control
frame (figure 13b), or a RATE CONTROL NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT control frame
has been received, or no RATE CONTROL POSITIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT control frame
was received before the supervision timer T~RC~ expires (Figure 13c)), the Iu
UP shall retrigger a Iu Rate Control procedure. If after N ~RC~ repetitions,
the error situation persists, the Iu UP protocol layers (sending and
receiving) take the appropriate local actions.

Corrupted Frame

Figure 13c: Unsuccessful Transfer of rate control: lost rate control
#### 6.5.3.2A Frequent Rate Control Procedures
Typically a new RATE CONTROL control frame should not be sent in the same
direction before the previous Iu Rate Control procedure was terminated
successfully.
If for some reasons (e.g. frequently received RATE CONTROL control frames from
the CN in a TFO connection to GSM) a RATE CONTROL control frame has to be sent
before the previous Iu Rate Control procedure was terminated successfully,
then the previous Iu Rate Control procedure is defined as terminated
successfully: the supervision timer T~RC~ shall be stopped and acknowledgement
frames (positive or negative) for the previous RATE CONTROL control frame
shall be ignored, i.e. only the most recent Iu Rate Control procedure shall be
active in the same direction.
Figure 14: Frequent Rate Control: only most recent one is important
Figure 15: Void
### 6.5.4 Time Alignment procedure
#### 6.5.4.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Time Alignment procedure is to minimise the buffer delay in
RNC by controlling the downlink transmission timing in the peer Iu UP protocol
layer entity.
The Time Alignment procedure is controlled by SRNC.
The Time Alignment procedure is invoked whenever the SRNC detects the
reception of Iu UP PDU at an inappropriate timing that leads to an unnecessary
buffer delay. The actual detection of the trigger in SRNC is an internal SRNC
matter and is out of the scope of the present document.
The Iu UP protocol layer entity in SRNC indicates the peer entity the
necessary amount of the delay or advance adjustment in the number of 500 Âµs
steps.
A supervision timer T~TA~ is started after sending the Iu UP TIME ALIGNMENT
control frame. This timer supervises the reception of the time alignment
acknowledgement frame.
The requested Iu UP protocol layer entity in the peer node adjusts the
transmission timing by the amount as indicated by SRNC.
If the TIME ALIGNMENT control frame is correctly formatted and treated by the
receiving Iu UP protocol layer and the time alignment is treated correctly by
the upper layers, this latter sends an time alignment acknowledgement frame.
Upon reception of a time alignment acknowledgement frame, the Iu UP protocol
layer in the SRNC stops the supervision timer T~TA~.
The procedure can be signalled at any time when transfer of user data is not
suspended by another control procedure.
Figure 15a: Successful Time Alignment
Figure 16: Void
#### 6.5.4.2 Unsuccessful operation
If the TIME ALIGNMENT control frame could not be handled by the peer side, the
peer side should send a NACK with a corresponding cause. When the Iu UP
protocol layer in the SRNC receives a NACK with cause \"Time Alignment not
supported\", then the SRNC shall not send additional TIME ALIGNMENT control
frames for that RAB (unless the Iu UP conditions change for that RAB). The
cause value \"Requested Time Alignment not possible\" is used to indicate that
the requested time alignment was not possible at that moment. At a later
moment the SRNC may initiate a new TIME ALIGNMENT control frame when needed.
If the TIME ALIGNMENT control frame is received by the RNC, it shall respond
with a NACK with the cause \"Time Alignment not supported\".
If the Iu UP protocol layer in the SRNC detects that the TIME ALIGNMENT
control frame has not been correctly interpreted or received, i.e NACK
received or timer expires, and the time alignment need still persists, the Iu
UP should retrigger a Time Alignment procedure. If after N ~TA~ repetitions,
the error situation persists, the Iu UP protocol layers take appropriate local
actions.
Upon reception of a TIME ALIGNMENT NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT control frame, the
Iu UP protocol layer in the SRNC stops the supervision timer T~TA~.

or 2) N ~TA~ expiries of timer T~TA~
Figure 16b: Time Alignment received by the RNC
### 6.5.5 Handling of Error Event procedure
#### 6.5.5.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Handling of Error Event procedure is to handle the error
reporting. Over the Iu UP protocol the error reports are made with ERROR EVENT
control frames. The Handling of Error Event procedure in the Iu UP can be
triggered by:
\- An error detected by the Iu UP functions (by receiving an erroneous frame
or by receiving a frame with unknown or unexpected data). In this case an Iu
UP- Status Indication may be used to inform the upper layers;
\- A request by the upper layers.
When an Error event is reported by an ERROR EVENT control frame the following
information shall be included:
\- A cause value;
\- Error distance (=0 if Iu UP function detected, =1 if requested by upper
layers).
Upon reception of an ERROR EVENT control frame the Iu UP functions should take
appropriate local actions based on the cause value. This may include reporting
the error to the upper layers with an Iu UP status indication.
Figure 15b: Successful Error event
#### 6.5.5.2 Unsuccessful operation
If the ERROR EVENT control frame is incorrectly formatted and cannot be
correctly treated by the receiving Iu UP protocol layer appropriate local
actions are taken (e.g. upper layers are informed). An error in an ERROR EVENT
control frame should not generate the sending of a new ERROR EVENT control
frame.
Figure 16c: Unsuccessful Transfer of ERROR EVENT control frame: 1) Frame loss
2) Corrupted Frame
### 6.5.6 Frame Quality Classification procedure
The Frame Quality Classification procedure uses the services of the Transfer
of User Data procedure to exchange across the Iu UP interface the Frame
Quality Classification information.

## 6.6 Elements for Iu UP communication in Support mode
### 6.6.1 General
In the present document the structure of frames will be specified by using
figures similar to figure 18.

Figure 18: Example frame format
Unless otherwise indicated, fields which consist of multiple bits within an
octet will have the more significant bit located at the higher bit position
(indicated above frame in figure 18). In addition, if a field spans several
octets, more significant bits will be located in lower numbered octets (right
of frame in figure 18).
On the Iu interface, the frame will be transmitted starting from the lowest
numbered octet. Within each octet, the bits are sent according decreasing bit
position (bit position 7 first).
Spare bits should be set to \"0\" by the sender and should not be checked by
the receiver.
The header part of the frame is always an integer number of octets. The
payload part is octet rounded (by adding \'Padding\' when needed).
The receiver should be able to remove an additional spare extension field that
may be present at the end of a frame. See description of Spare extension
field.
### 6.6.2 Frame Format for predefined size SDUs
#### 6.6.2.1 PDU Type 0
PDU Type 0 is defined to transfer user data over the Iu UP in support mode for

this does not consider the usage of spare extension field]).
The Iu UP Frame Control Part and the Iu UP Frame Check Sum Part constitute the
Iu UP PDU Type 0 Frame Header.
#### 6.6.2.2 PDU Type 1

pre-defined SDU sizes when no payload error detection scheme is necessary over
Iu UP (i.e. no payload CRC).

### 6.6.3 Coding of information elements in frames
#### 6.6.3.1 PDU Type
**Description:** The PDU type indicates the structure of the Iu UP frame. The
field takes the value of the PDU Type it identifies: i.e. \"0\" for PDU Type
0. The PDU type is in bit 4 to bit 7 in the first octet of the frame. PDU type
is used in all frames in support mode for predefined SDU sizes.
**Value range:** {0-1 and 14 in use, 2-13: reserved for future PDU types,
15=reserved for future PDU type extensions}
**Field length:** 4 bits
#### 6.6.3.2 Ack/Nack
**Description:** The Ack/Nack field tells if the frame is:
\- A control procedure frame;
\- A positive acknowledgement (ACK) of a control procedure frame;
\- A negative acknowledgement (NACK) of a control procedure frame.
**Value range:** {0=control procedure frame, 1=ACK, 2=NACK, 3=reserved}
**Field length:** 2 bits
#### 6.6.3.3 Frame Number
**Description:** The Iu UP frame numbering is handled by a Frame Number. The
frame numbering can be based on either time or sent Iu UP PDU. In case the
frame numbering is based on time the purpose of the frame number is to be of
help in handling the Time Alignment functionality. When the frame number is
based on time, the Frame number set in the PDU header is incremented by one
(modulo 16) at each new ITI. The Frame number set in the PDU header shall be
based on the timing of the source. The source is where the original payload
was created. Two packets that were consecutive at the source shall not have
the same frame number assigned. In case the Frame number relates to sent Iu UP
PDU the purpose of the Frame Number is to provide the receiving entity with a
mechanism to keep track of lost Iu UP frames. When the frame number is based
on sent Iu UP PDU, the Frame number is incremented by one (modulo 16) for each
sent Iu UP PDU. For a given user data connection, there is no relations
between the frame numbers of frames sent in the downlink direction and the
frame numbers of frames sent in the uplink direction.
In the case the Frame Number relates to sent Iu UP PDU, the following applies:
\- Frame loss is when an incoming PDU frame has a frame number that is equal
to (previous PDU frame number + 2) modulo [max. PDU frame number \+ 1]. This
indicates that one and only one PDU frame has been lost.
\- Unexpected frame number is when an incoming PDU does not have the expected
frame number and is not considered as a Frame Loss.
**Value range:** {0-15}.
**Field length:** 4 bits.
#### 6.6.3.4 PDU Type 14 Frame Number
**Description:** The Iu UP frame numbering is handled by a Frame Number. The
purpose of the PDU Type 14 Frame Number is to provide the receiving entity
with a mechanism to keep track of lost Iu UP frames. The PDU Type 14 Frame
Number shall be managed as one single counter for all control procedure
functions of a RAB. The sender shall increment this number by one (modulo 4)
for each sent Iu UP Type 14 PDU starting with value 0 for the first PDU Type
14 INITIALISATION control frame sent out of the initialisation procedure. The
counter shall be reset to 0 in case a new initialisation takes place. It is
also used to relate the acknowledgment frame to the frame being acknowledged
i.e. the same PDU Type 14 Frame Number is used in the positive or negative
acknowledgement frame as the one used in the frame being acknowledged.
The PDU Type 14 Frame Number shall be handled independently per direction,
i.e. control frames other than acknowledgment frames shall be numbered
independently per direction.
The following applies for PDU Type14 Frame Number:
\- Frame loss is when an incoming PDU frame has a frame number that is equal
to (previous PDU frame number + 2) modulo [max. PDU frame number \+ 1]. This
indicates that one and only one PDU frame has been lost.
\- Unexpected frame number is when an incoming PDU does not have the expected
frame number and is not considered as a Frame Loss.
Upon detection of frame loss or unexpected PDU Type 14 Frame Number in a
procedure other than initialisation, the receiving entity shall still consider
the frame as valid and handle it normally e.g. treat it and send an
acknowledgement frame when appropriate.
**Value range:** {0-3}.
**Field length:** 2 bits.
#### 6.6.3.5 Frame Quality Classification (FQC)
**Description:** Frame Quality Classification is used to classify the Iu UP
frames depending on whether errors have occurred in the frame or not. Frame
Quality Classification is dependent on the RAB attribute _Delivery of
erroneous SDU_ IE.
**Value range:** {0=frame good, 1=frame bad, 2=frame bad due to radio,
3=spare}.
**Field length:** 2 bits.

used to specify the sizes of the subflows.
**Value range:** {0-62, 63=RFCI not applicable}.
**Field length:** 6 bits.
#### 6.6.3.7 Procedure Indicator
**Description:** The Procedure Indicator identifies the control procedure in
the current frame.

shorter than 11 bits are detected, as well as all odd number of bits faulty
(and two-bit faults) when the protected area is shorter than 500 bits (max 62
octets).

## 6.7 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
### 6.7.1 General
Error handling in Iu UP protocol is applicable only for Iu UP in Support mode.
The Handling of Error Event procedure is the procedure handling error
reporting. The Handling of Error Event procedure in the Iu UP can be triggered
by:
\- An error detected by the Iu UP functions (by receiving an erroneous frame
or by receiving a frame with unknown or unexpected data);
\- A request by the upper layers;
\- An ERROR EVENT control frame over the Iu UP protocol.
The error can be reported either by:
\- An ERROR EVENT control frame over the Iu UP protocol;
\- An Iu UP Status Indication to upper layers (e.g. to be used by O&M).
When an Error event is reported, either by an Iu-UP-Status-Indication, or by
an ERROR EVENT control frame the following information shall be included:
\- Type of the error (syntactical error, semantical error or other error);
\- Error distance, i.e. information where the error occurred.
### 6.7.2 Error detected by Iu UP functions
When an error is detected within the Iu UP functions (by receiving a frame
containing erroneous, unknown or unexpected data) one of the following actions
is taken depending on the type of the error:
1\. Error indicated to upper layers by sending a Iu-UP-Status-Indication
primitive;
2\. ERROR EVENT control frame sent;
3\. ERROR EVENT control frame sent and error indicated to upper layers by
sending a Iu-UP-Status-Indication primitive;
4\. No action.
### 6.7.3 Request by upper layers
When the IU UP receives an Iu-UP-Status-Request indicating Error event then an
ERROR EVENT control frame should be sent over the Iu UP protocol indicating
the appropriate error type.
### 6.7.4 Error event frame over the Iu UP protocol
When an ERROR EVENT control frame is received over the Iu UP protocol an Iu-
UP-Status-Indication with \'Error event\' information indicating the error
type should be made to the upper layers. The Error event report contains a
\'Cause value\' that tells the type of the error. The Error event report also
contains a field \'Error distance\' that tells the distance to the entity
reporting the error event. The \'Error distance\' is \"0\" when the error is
originally sent. When an Error event report is forwarded the \'Error
distance\' is incremented by one.
### 6.7.5 Handling of error reports
#### 6.7.5.1 General
Figure 28 shows the external error case when the Handling of Error Event
procedure is originally triggered by an Iu-UP-Status-Request. As an action on
this the Handling of Error Event procedure sends an ERROR EVENT control frame
over the Iu UP. On the other side the reception of ERROR EVENT control frame
triggers the Handling of Error Event procedure , and an Iu-UP-Status-
Indication is sent to upper layers. The handling is symmetrical over the Iu UP
protocol.
Figure 28: External error
Figure 29 shows the internal error case when the Handling of Error Event
procedure is originally triggered by the Iu UP functions. As an action on this
the Handling of Error Event procedure sends an ERROR EVENT control frame over
the Iu UP. On the other side the reception of ERROR EVENT control frame
triggers the Handling of Error Event procedure, and an Iu-UP-Status-Indication
is sent to the upper layers. The handling is symmetrical over the Iu UP
protocol.
Figure 29: Internal error
#### 6.7.5.2 Error distance
In an ERROR EVENT control frame the error distance has the following meaning:
0: Error report relates to an Iu UP function error at the other side.\ 1:
Error report relates to an error at the other side reported by the upper
layers.
In an Iu UP-Status indication the error distance has the following meaning:
0: Error report relates to an local Iu UP function error.\ 1: Error report
relates to an Iu UP function error at the other side.\ 2: Error report relates
to an error at the other side reported by the upper layers.

### 6.7.7 Error detection
#### 6.7.7.1 General
Error detection is provided on frames through a Cyclic Redundancy Check. The
CRC for the payload is 10 bits and for the header it is 6 bits.
#### 6.7.7.2 CRC Calculation
The parity bits are generated by one of the following cyclic generator
polynomials:
g~CRC6~(D) = D^6^ + D^5^ + D^3^ + D^2^ + D^1^ + 1;
g~CRC10~(D) = D^10^ + D^9^ + D^5^ + D^4^ + D^1^ + 1.
Denote the bits to be protected of a frame by {width="1.0965277777777778in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}({width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}being the bit with the highest bit position in
the first octet), and the parity bits by {width="1.1666666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}. _A~i~_ is the length of the protected data and
L _~i~_ is 6 or 10 depending on the CRC length.
The encoding is performed in a systematic form, which means that in GF(2), the
polynomial
{width="4.208333333333333in" height="0.2777777777777778in"}
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC6~(D) and the polynomial
{width="4.277777777777778in" height="0.2777777777777778in"}
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC10~(D). If
{width="0.44375in" height="0.25in"}, {width="1.8194444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}.
#### 6.7.7.3 Relation between input and output of the Cyclic Redundancy Check
The protected bits are left unchanged in the frame. The parity bits for the
Header CRC are put in the Header CRC field with{width="0.19375in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} being the highest bit position of the first
octet of the Header CRC field. The parity bits for the Payload CRC are put in
the Payload CRC field with{width="0.19375in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}
being the highest bit position of the first octet of the Payload CRC field.

## 7.2 Primitives towards the upper layers at the RNL SAP
### 7.2.1 General
The Iu UP protocol layer interacts with upper layers as illustrated in the
figure above _._ The interactions with the upper layers are shown in terms of
primitives where the primitives represent the logical exchange of information
and control between the upper layer and the Iu UP protocol layer. They do not
specify or constrain implementations.
The following primitives are defined:
\- Iu-UP-DATA;
\- Iu-UP-STATUS;
\- Iu-UP-UNIT-DATA.

### 7.2.2 Iu-UP-DATA-REQUEST
This primitive is used as a request from the upper layer Iu NAS Data Stream
entity to send the RAB subflow SDU(s) on the established transport connection.
This primitive includes the RFCI, the Frame Number and FQC information of the
payload.
The Iu UP protocol layer forms the Iu UP data frame, the Iu Data Stream DU
being the payload of the Iu UP frame, and transfers the frame by means of the
lower layer services.
### 7.2.3 Iu-UP-DATA-INDICATION
This primitive is used as an indication to the upper layer entity to pass the
Iu NAS Data Stream User Plane information of a received Iu UP frame.
This primitive includes the RFCI, the Frame Number and FQC information of the
payload.
This primitive may also include information aiming at informing the upper
layers of a faulty situation that relates to the payload included in the
primitive.
### 7.2.4 Iu-UP-STATUS-REQUEST
This primitive is used to pass control procedure information from the upper
layer.
This primitive shall contain the complete protocol data for the respective
procedure.
### 7.2.5 Iu-UP-STATUS-INDICATION
This primitive is used to pass control procedure information to the upper
layer.
This primitive shall contain the complete protocol data for the respective
procedure.
### 7.2.6 Iu-UP-UNIT-DATA-REQUEST
This primitive is used as a request from the upper layer to send an Iu UP
payload on the established transport connection.
The Iu UP protocol layer transfers the Iu Data Stream DU by means of the lower
layer services without adding any protocol header overhead.
### 7.2.7 Iu-UP-UNIT-DATA-INDICATION
This primitive is used as an indication to the upper layer entity to pass the
Iu UP payload.
## 7.3 Primitives towards the transport layers at TNL SAP
### 7.3.1 General
Access to the Transport network Layer is performed through a generic SAP: TNL-
SAP.
When the Transport Network upper layer consists of AAL2, the TNL SAP maps onto
the AAL-SAP through which communication is performed using specific AAL
primitives.
When the Transport Network upper layer consists of GTP-U, the TNL SAP maps
onto the GTP-U SAP through which communication is performed using generic
primitives.
The choice of communication, specific or generic, through the TNL SAP is fixed
by the Radio Network Layer control plane logic. This choice is based on the
requirements placed by e.g. the RAB characteristics, the CN domain requesting
the RAB establishment or other operator\'s choice.
### 7.3.2 ATM/AAL2 based Transport layer
#### 7.3.2.1 General
When the Iu UP protocol layer uses the services of an ATM/AAL2 transport
(ITU-T Recommendation I.363.2 [7]), it uses an established AAL2 connection for
transferring frames between the peer TNL-SAPs at both ends of the Iu User
plane access points. The Transport Network Control Plane over Iu handles the
signalling to establish and release the AAL2 call connections.
#### 7.3.2.2 AAL2 Service Primitives used by the Iu UP protocol
AAL2 services and primitives used at the Service Access Point from the AAL2
layer are shown in table 3.
Table 3: AAL2 primitives and parameters
* * *
Primitive Type Parameters Comments SSSAR-UNITDATA Request SSSAR-INFO  
SSSAR-UUI Not used (note) SSSAR-UNITDATA Indication SSSAR-INFO  
SSSAR-UUI Not used (note) NOTE: The setting of this field is set to not used
i.e. decimal value 26 according to ITU-T Rec. I.366.1 [8].
* * *
The primitives of table 3 are the standard primitives of ITU-T Rec. I.366.1
[8]. These primitives are intended to be used in the Iu UP.
### 7.3.3 GTP-U based Transport Layer
#### 7.3.3.1 General
When the Iu UP protocol layer uses the services of a GTP-U transport, it uses
an established GTP-U tunnel for transferring frames between the GTP-U tunnel
endpoints at both ends of the Iu User plane access points. The RANAP Control
Plane signalling over Iu handles the signalling to establish and release the
GTP-U tunnels.
#### 7.3.3.2 Generic Service Primitives used by the Iu UP protocol
Generic primitives are used at the GTP-U SAP. They are shown in table 4.
Table 4: Generic primitives and parameters to and from GTP-U layer
* * *
Primitive Type Parameters Comments Iu-UP-UNITDATA Request Iu-UP-payload  
Iu-UP-UNITDATA Indication Iu-UP-payload
* * *
### 7.3.4 RTP based Transport Layer
#### 7.3.4.1 General
When the Iu UP protocol layer uses the services of a RTP/UDP/IP transport, it
uses an established RTP session for transferring frames between the two RTP
endpoints at both ends of the Iu User plane access points as defined in IETF
RFC 1889 [14]. A single Iu-UP PDU shall be transported as RTP payload. A
dynamic Payload Type (IETF RFC 1890 [15]) shall be used (see TS 25.414 [4]).
#### 7.3.4.2 Generic Service Primitives used by the Iu UP protocol
Generic primitives are used at the RTP SAP. They are shown in table 5.

# 8 Evolution of Iu UP Protocol
## 8.1 Principles for Protocol Evolution
### 8.1.1 Unknown field value
The Iu UP protocol may be evolved by taking into use field values that have
been specified to be reserved for future use or have been specified as spare
values. When a UP protocol entity receives an unknown field value, it can
react differently depending whether the unknown value is reserved for future
use or if it is a spare value. The following principles are recommended for
receiver reactions:
\- If a spare value is used by the sender, but not understood by the receiver,
there should be a default action for the receiver. This default action should
be defined on a field basis;
\- If a value that is reserved for future use is used by the sender, but not
understood by the receiver, the value should be rejected by the receiver. This
should be done by sending a Negative Acknowledgement to the peer entity, if
possible. Otherwise an Error Event should be generated in order to inform the
upper layers and the peer entity;
\- A received ERROR EVENT control frame shall not trigger another ERROR EVENT
control frame back to the sender, even though e.g. the Cause value in the
received ERROR EVENT control frame would not be understood.
In the following the recommended actions of the receiver are handled field by
field when an unknown field value is received.
**[PDU Type]{.underline}**
Recommended action if reserved values used: Generate Error Event, i.e. the
upper layers and the peer entity are informed about the error event with
Cause: \"PDU type unknown\".
**[FQC]{.underline}**
Recommended action if spare values used: Ignore the field and pass it onwards.
**[ACK/NACK]{.underline}**
Proposed action if reserved values used: Generate an Error Event, i.e. the
upper layers and the peer entity are informed about the error event with
Cause: \"Unknown reserved value\".
**[Procedure Indicator]{.underline}**
Recommended action if reserved values used: Generate an Error Event, i.e. the
upper layers and the peer entity are informed about the error event with
Cause: \"Unknown procedure\".
**[Error Cause value]{.underline}**
Value \"49\" is reserved for \"Iu UP Mode version not supported\" whatever the
Iu UP Mode version.
Recommended action if reserved values used: Generate Error Event, i.e. the
upper layers and the peer entity are informed about the error event with
Cause: \"Unknown reserved value\".
Recommended action if spare values used: Ignore the field and pass it onwards.
### 8.1.2 Adding a new field to an existing frame
If there is a need to add a new field to an existing procedure, the following
principles shall be applied:
\- The PDU type defines the header mask. Therefore, a new field shall not be
added to the header part of an existing frame and possible spare bits in the
header shall not be taken into use since these would be violations of the
header mask;
\- The Procedure Indicator shall define the fields that should be in a control
frame;
\- There shall be only one Procedure Indicator for each procedure;
\- If a new field needs to be introduced to an existing procedure (i.e.
existing procedure that is defined in an existing UP version), the new field
shall not be _added_ to the payload part. Instead, the new field may be
introduced by placing it to a spare field in the payload part of the frame, if
possible;
\- However, if a new field needs to be introduced to an existing procedure,
but spare fields(s) in the payload part cannot be used to introduce the new
field, then a new procedure shall be created and hence a new Procedure
Indicator value shall be allocated for the new procedure;
\- To enable simple protocol evolution, when a new Procedure Indicator will be
introduced, the new frame shall include both the new fields and the fields of
the old frame;
\- When an implementation receives an unknown Procedure Indicator it may use
the ERROR EVENT control frame with Cause: \"Unknown procedure\" to report
this. This indicates to the sender that the procedure was not understood and
it may try with an older procedure.
### 8.1.3 Adding a new PDU type
In the future, the Iu UP protocol may evolve so that there is a need to add a
new PDU type. The criteria for introducing a new PDU type could be e.g.:
\- The Procedure Indicators may run out and there is a need to have more;
\- There is a need to change the header mask, e.g. the Frame Number field may
need to be increased or the CRC field needs to be modified.
While the PDU Type 15 is reserved for future PDU type extensions, there may be
\'subtypes\' under PDU Type 15 in the future and there also may be new
procedures in these \'subtypes\'.
Thus it has to be ensured that if the same Procedure Indicator value is used
under several PDU types, it should be made clear e.g. in the Error Event cause
element, which PDU type it concerns.
The maximum length of the Spare Extension field is defined per PDU type. Thus
when a new PDU type is added, an appropriate length for the Spare Extension
field (if any) has to be defined. For Release '99, a length of 4 octets has
been used for data PDUs, and 32 octets for control PDUs.
### 8.1.4 Protocol version handling
In the future, new versions of the Iu UP protocol may be introduced. A reason
for a new version of the protocol could be, e.g.:
\- The earlier introduced new features or functions are required to be
mandatory in the new version;
\- Due to technical development, the new version of the protocol could be
totally different (and incompatible) from the earlier version.
The following principles shall be applied to version handling of Iu UP
protocol:
\- It shall be possible to introduce additional modes of operation;
\- It shall be possible to evolve the operation modes independently of each
other;
\- There shall be independent version numbers for each mode of operation;
\- The mode of operation of an Iu UP protocol instance is decided by the CN.
Further, the CN shall indicate those versions that are required to support
certain features, e.g. TrFO. The version of the mode among the required ones
shall be negotiated between the CN and UTRAN during Initialisation procedure;
\- The version number of a UP operation mode may change or be unchanged
between different releases;
\- When the protocol is evolved it shall be made clear in the specification,
which features belong to which versions;
\- A new version may be an evolution (i.e. compatible) of the old version or
the new version may be totally different from the old version.
\- The structure of the PDU Type 14 header, up to and including header CRC,
shall remain unchanged whatever the Iu UP version.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Illustration of usage of RFCI for AMR speech
RAB
This annex contains information related to usage of RFCIs in the context of
AMR speech RAB.
The following figure illustrates the RFCI allocation and flow throughout the
UTRAN.
{width="6.297916666666667in" height="4.31875in"}
1\. **RAB Attributes** : at RAB establishment or reconfiguration, the SDU
format information parameter is passed to UTRAN. The SDU information is
organised per BER i.e. RAB sub Flow. For instance, 12,2 kbits/s AMR codec is
passed as RAB sub flow 1 SDU size: 81 bits --class A bits-, as RAB sub flow 2
SDU size: 103 bits --class B bits-, as RAB sub flow 3 SDU size: 60 bits
--class C-, which makes one RAB sub Flow Combination. This is done for all
source rates (i.e. all codec modes, DTX also if included). So using the RAB
subflows combination set from Table A.1, the SDU Formation Information
Parameters for RAB subflow 1 is [81,42,39,0], for RAB subflow 2 is
[103,53,0,0], and for RAB subflow 3 is [60,0,0,0]. The Iu UP is used in
support mode for predefined SDU size.
2\. **Allocation of RFCIs** : the RNC dynamically allocates an identification
(RFCI) to each permitted/possible combinations it can offer. E.g. for 0
kbits/s, the RNC allocates RFCI 0, for the SID, the RNC allocates RFCI 3, for
4,75 kbits/s, the RNC allocates RFCI 2, and for 12,2. kbits/s, the RNC
allocates RFCI 1 (according to the example table A.1).
3\. **Configuration of L2/L3** based on RFCIs: RFCIs are used to configure the
L2/L3. RLC (TS 25.322 [11]) is used in transparent mode. MAC (TS 25.321 [10])
configures its co-ordinated DCHs with the RFCIs and associates one RFCI to one
TFI.
4\. **Initialisation of Iu UP** : the RNC reports the permitted combinations
it can offer to the transcoder using an inband Iu INITIALISATION control frame
containing the RFCIs and associated RAB sub Flow sizes.
5\. **Configuration of L2/L3 based on e.g. TFIs** : idem as 3. L2/L3 may use
e.g. TFI to communicate with the Codec about the RAB sub-Flow structure of the
SDU received or to be sent.
6\. **RFCIs+ SDU size information** : the RFCIs and associated RAB sub Flow
sizes received within the Iu INITIALISATION control frame are passed to the
Codec for configuration.
7\. **Example of DL frame transfer:**
7.1. The Codec encodes a 12,2 kbits/s frame. It sends down to the Iu UP an SDU
with an associated RFCI equals to 1 (in this example).
7.2. The Iu UP packs a frame with a header containing an RFCI set to value
\"1\", and the payload made of the SDU received from the Codec.
7.3. The Iu UP passes to L2/L3, the Iu frame payload (the Codec SDU) and the
RFCI. The L2/L3 uses this RFCI to break the Iu frame onto the co-ordinated
DCHs corresponding to the different bits protection classes. The corresponding
TFI is selected.
7.4. The radio frame is sent with the TFCI chosen by MAC (TS 25.321 [10]).
7.5. The L2/L3 receives the SDUs on the co-ordinated DCHs, combines them back
and uses e.g. the TFI to indicate to the codec the structure of the received
frame.
Figure A.1
For information on RAB subflow combinations used for AMR speech see TS 26.102
[12].
SRNC allocates one or more possible/available RAB sub-flow combination(s) and
generates RAB sub-flow combination set. RAB sub-flow combination number is
dynamically generated by SRNC. This RAB sub-flow combination set is signalled
towards CN with user plane signalling as described in TS 25.401 [1]. The
signalling towards UE is to be defined by TSG-RAN WG2.
**RAB sub-flow combination set:**
A RAB sub-flow combination indicator, RFCI, indicates which RAB sub flow
combination will be used for the Iu user frames. In the communication phase
the RFCI is included in the user frame, and the RFCI state the structure of
the user frame.
Table A.1 exemplifies the allocation of 4 different RAB sub-flows combinations

###### ## Annex B (informative): Illustration of protocol states in the Iu UP
This annex contains information related to possible protocol states for
operation of the Iu UP. This annex does not constraint implementation and is
for illustration purposes only.
The state model is common for both ends of the Iu UP so that the protocol
machines are operating symmetrically. This approach is taken to facilitate
state description for all cases including possible future scenarios where the
Iu UP could be terminated elsewhere.
NOTE: Primitive Iu-UP-CONFIG-Req is used by upper layers to configure the Iu
UP protocol layer. It is used in this annex for illustrative purposes and
therefore it is not defined in clause 7.
# B.1 Protocol state model for transparent mode
Figure B.1 illustrates the state model for transparent mode Iu UP instances. A
transparent mode instance can be in one of following states.
{width="5.993055555555555in" height="2.017361111111111in"}
Figure B.1: Protocol state model for transparent mode
## B.1.1 Null State
In the null state the Iu UP instance does not exist and therefore it is not
possible to transfer any data through it.
Upon reception of a Iu-UP-CONFIG-Req from higher layer the Iu UP instance is
created and transparent mode data transfer ready state is entered. The mode
information is received either through RANAP signalling or directly in the CN
node. In the Iu-UP-CONFIG-Req e.g. the following information will be
indicated:
\- Transparent mode.
## B.1.2 Transparent Mode Data Transfer Ready State
In the transparent mode data transfer ready state, transparent mode data can
be exchanged between the entities.
Upon reception of Iu-UP-CONFIG-Req indicating release from higher layer, the
Iu UP instance is terminated and the null state is entered.
# B.2 Protocol state model for support mode for predefined SDU sizes
Figure B.2 illustrates the state model for support mode Iu UP instances. A
support mode instance can be in one of the following states.
{width="5.989583333333333in" height="4.270833333333333in"}
Figure B.2: Protocol state model for support mode
## B.2.1 Null State
In the null state the Iu UP instance does not exist and therefore it is not
possible to transfer any data through it.
Upon reception of a Iu-UP-CONFIG-Req from higher layer the Iu UP instance is
created and initialisation state is entered. In the Iu-UP-CONFIG-Req e.g. the
following information could be indicated:
\- Support mode for predefined SDU sizes;
\- Time alignment (FFS);
\- Indication of delivery of erroneous SDUs;
\- Periodicity;
\- required UP versions.
## B.2.2 Initialisation State
In the initialisation state the instance exchanges initialisation information
with its peer Iu UP instance.
Upon reception of Iu-UP-CONFIG-Req indicating release from higher layer, the
Iu UP instance is terminated and the null state is entered.
Upon sending or receiving of an INITIALISATION control frame the Iu UP
instance remains in the Initialisation state. The sending side starts a
supervision timer T~INIT~. The receiving side acknowledges the INITIALISATION
control frame with a positive acknowledgement or a negative acknowledgement.
Upon reception of the last initialisation acknowledgement frame, the
supervision timer T~INIT~ is stopped and the Iu UP instance enters SMpSDU data
transfer ready state.
After sending a positive acknowledgement of the last INITIALISATION control
frame, the Iu UP instance enters SMpSDU data transfer ready state. Note that
CN does not know if the initialisation ACK was correctly received by the RNC
(and Initialisation procedure successfully completed) until it receives RAB
assignment response, or use data from the RNC. The CN must therefore be able
to continue receiving INITIALISATION control frames by re-entering the
Initialisation state (from Support Mode Data Transfer Ready State), if the CN
has started to send user data before receiving the indication that
Initialisation was successfully completed.
Upon reception of an INITIALISATION NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT control frame
(INIT NACK) initialisation frame can be repeated n times.
If after n repetitions, the Initialisation procedure is unsuccessfully
terminated (due to n negative acknowledgements or timer expires) the Handling
of Error Event procedure is used to report the Initialisation failure and the
Iu UP instance remains in the initialisation state. Upon reception of an
INITIALISATION control frame the Initialisation state is entered.
## B.2.3 Support Mode Data Transfer Ready State
In the support mode data transfer ready state, support mode data can be
exchanged between the peer Iu UP instances.
Upon reception of Iu-UP-DATA-Request from the upper layer or SSSAR-UNITDATA-
Indication or Iuâ€‘UPâ€‘UNITDATA-Indication from TNL layer, appropriate user data
transfer procedures are performed. Iu UP instance remains in the SMpSDU data
transfer ready state.
Upon sending of Iu-UP-DATA- Indication or SSSAR-UNITDATA-Request or Iu-UP-
UNITDATA-Request the Iu UP instance remains in the SMpSDU data transfer ready
state.
Upon sending or receiving of a rate control PDU the Iu UP instance remains in
the SMpSDU data transfer ready state.
Upon sending of a Iu-UP-STATUS-Indication (rate control) the Iu UP instance
remains in the SMpSDU data transfer ready state.
Upon reception of Iu-UP-CONFIG-Req from higher layer the Iu UP instance is
terminated and the null state is entered.
Upon detection of a protocol fault, Iu-UP-STATUS-Indication is sent to upper
layer an ERROR EVENT control frame may be sent over Iu UP.
In case of handover or relocation, Initialisation procedures may have to be
performed and Iu UP instance may have to enter the initialisation state.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Open Issues of the Iu UP
This annex contains information related to open issues left in the Iu UP
protocol.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Distributed rate decision within RNC
This annex contains information related to the distributed rate decision
within an RNC (see also within TS 23.153 [13])
The Iu Rate Control procedure over Iu UP is normally controlled by the entity
controlling the rate control over UTRAN i.e. the SRNC. The SRNC may send RATE
CONTROL control frames in uplink (to the CN) to control the rates in downlink.
The SRNC may also send RATE CONTROL control frames in downlink (to the UE) to
control the rates in uplink. The Iu Rate Control procedures for both
directions are independent of each other, i.e. different rates may be
permitted in uplink and downlink, see figure D.1.
{width="4.166666666666667in" height="1.9270833333333333in"}
Figure D.1: Rate Control for uplink and downlink
The rates associated with the service could be rank ordered from \"lower\" to
\"higher\" according to their SDU bit rates and RFCI values, with RFCI=0
having the lowest rate. A rate lower than the currently allowed maximum rate
shall not be forbidden while a higher rate is forbidden. In order to stabilise
the Iu Rate Control procedure and its influences on the radio link and the
network, typically only one additional rate shall be forbidden or permitted in
subsequent RATE CONTROL control frames.
In some cases, as TrFO and TFO, the rate is also controlled by the remote
partner at the other end of the Iu UP. The SRNC may then also receive RATE
CONTROL control frames in downlink (from the CN) controlling the rates in
uplink. Only rates that are permitted by both sides for one direction shall be
used in that direction. The SRNC shall therefore combine these RATE CONTROL
control frames from the CN with its own control frames for the uplink
direction by taking the RATE CONTROL control frame with the lowest maximum
rate and shall send this RATE CONTROL control frame downlink to the UE. This
combination is denoted in figure D.2 with \"Rate Control (CN âŠ• RNC)\".
