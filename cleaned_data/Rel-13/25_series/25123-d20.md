# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purpose of the present document the following terms and definitions
apply.
The main general definitions strictly related to the transmission and
reception characteristics but important also for the present document can be
found in [3] for UE FDD, in [4] for BS FDD, in [5] for UE TDD, in [6] for BS
TDD.
**Node B:** A logical node responsible for radio transmission / reception in
one or more cells to/from the User Equipment. Terminates the Iub interface
towards the RNC.
**Power Spectral Density:** The units of Power Spectral Density (PSD) are
extensively used in this document. PSD is a function of power versus frequency
and when integrated across a given bandwidth, the function represents the mean
power in such a bandwidth. When the mean power is normalised to (divided by)
the chip-rate it represents the mean energy per chip. Some signals are
directly defined in terms of energy per chip, (DPCH_E~c~, E~c~, OCNS_E~c~ and
P-CCPCH_E~c~) and others defined in terms of PSD (I~o~, I~oc~, I~or~ and
Î~or~). There also exist quantities that are a ratio of energy per chip to PSD
(DPCH_E~c~/I~or~, E~c~/I~or~ etc.). This is the common practice of relating
energy magnitudes in communication systems.\ It can be seen that if both
energy magnitudes in the ratio are divided by time, the ratio is converted
from an energy ratio to a power ratio, which is more useful from a measurement
point of view. It follows that an energy per chip of X dBm/3.84 MHz (3.84 Mcps
TDD option) or X dBm/1.28 MHz (1.28 Mcps TDD option) can be expressed as a
mean power per chip of X dBm. Similarly, a signal PSD of Y dBm/3.84 MHz (3.84
Mcps TDD option) or Y dBm/1.28 MHz (1.28 Mcps TDD option) can be expressed as
a signal power of Y dBm.
**MBSFN cluster:** Set of cells operating in MBSFN mode providing only MBMS
service in PtM mode and seen as one cell by a UE.
The following two definitions are applicable for LCR TDD multi-frequency
operation.
**Intra-frequency cell:** In idle, CELL-FACH, CELL-PCH and URA-PCH state,
intra-frequency cell is defined as the cell of which the primary frequency is
the same as the user's current frequency. In CELL-DCH state, intra-frequency
cell is defined as the cell of which the frequency to be measured in that cell
is the same as the operating frequency for single carrier operation or is the
same as the associated DPCH operating frequency for multi-carrier operation
when DPCH is configured, or is the same as the associated E-RUCCH operating
frequency for multi-carrier operation when DPCH is not configured.
**Inter-frequency cell:** In idle, CELL-FACH, CELL-PCH and URA-PCH state,
inter-frequency cell is defined as the cell of which the primary frequency is
different from the user's current frequency. In CELL-DCH state, inter-
frequency cell is defined as the cell of which the frequency to be measured in
that cell is different from the operating frequency for single carrier
operation or is different from the associated DPCH operating frequency for
multi-carrier operation when DPCH is configured, or is different from the
associated E-RUCCH operating frequency for multi-carrier operation when DPCH
is not configured.

## 3.4 Test tolerances
The requirements given in the present document make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 34.122 and 25.142 define test
tolerances. These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The test tolerances are then added to the limits in this specification to
create test limits. The measurement results are compared against the test
limits as defined by the shared risk principle.
Shared Risk is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 subclause 6.5.
# 4 Idle Mode
## 4.1 Cell Selection
### 4.1.1 Introduction
After a UE has switched on and a PLMN has been selected, the Cell selection
process takes place, as described in [18]. This process allows the UE to
select a suitable cell where to camp on in order to access available services.
In this process the UE can use stored information (_Stored information cell
selection_) or not (_Initial cell selection_).
## 4.2 Cell Re-selection
### 4.2.1 Introduction
#### 4.2.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option
The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable cell
and camp on it.
When the UE is in either _Camped Normally state or Camped_ _on Any Cell_ state
on a TDD cell, the UE shall attempt to identify, synchronise and monitor
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated in the
measurement control system information of the serving cell. UE measurement
activity is also controlled by measurement rules defined in [18], allowing the
UE to limit its measurement activity if certain conditions are fullfilled.
#### 4.2.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option
The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable cell
and camp on it.
When the UE is in either _Camped Normally state or Camped_ _on Any Cell_ state
on a TDD cell, the UE shall attempt to identify, synchronise and monitor
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated in the
measurement control system information of the serving cell. UE measurement
activity is also controlled by measurement rules defined in [18], allowing the
UE to limit its measurement activity if certain conditions are fullfilled.
#### 4.2.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option
The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable cell
and camp on it.
When the UE is in either _Camped Normally state or Camped_ _on Any Cell_ state
on a TDD cell, the UE shall attempt to identify, synchronise and monitor
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated in the
measurement control system information of the serving cell. UE measurement
activity is also controlled by measurement rules defined in [18], allowing the
UE to limit its measurement activity if certain conditions are fullfilled.
### 4.2.2 Requirements
In the following sections, T~higher_priority_search~ is defined as (60 *
N~layers~) seconds, where N~layers~ is the total number of configured higher
priority E-UTRA, UTRA FDD and UTRA TDD carrier frequencies and is additionally
increased by one if one or more groups of GSM frequencies is configured as a
higher priority.
#### 4.2.2.1 Measurement and evaluation of cell selection criteria S of
serving cell
##### 4.2.2.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option
The UE shall measure the PCCPCH RSCP level of the serving cell and evaluate
the cell selection criterion S~rxlev~ defined in [18] for the serving cell at
least every DRX cycle. The UE shall filter the PCCPCH RSCP measurement of the
serving cell using at least 2 measurements, which are taken so that the time
difference between the measurements is at least T~measureTDD~/2 (see table
4.1).
If the UE has evaluated in N~serv~ successive measurements that the serving
cell does not fulfil the cell selection criterion S, the UE shall initiate the
measurements of all neighbour cells indicated in the measurement control
system information, regardless of the measurement rules currently limiting UE
measurement activities.
If the UE has not found any new suitable cell based the on searches and
measurements of the neighbour cells indicated in the measurement control
system information for 12 s, the UE shall initiate cell selection procedures
for the selected PLMN as defined in [18].
On transition from CELL_DCH to CELL_PCH/URA_PCH, if a UE cannot find a
suitable UTRA cell, then it is considered to be \"out of service area\" and
shall perform actions according to [16].
##### 4.2.2.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option
The UE shall measure the PCCPCH RSCP level of the serving cell and evaluate
the cell selection criterion S defined in [18] for the serving cell at least
every DRX cycle. The UE shall filter the PCCPCH RSCP level of the serving cell
using at least 2 measurements, which are taken so that the time difference
between the first measurement and the last measurement used for filtering is
at least T~measureNTDD~/2 (see table 4.1A).
If the UE has evaluated in N~serv~ consecutive DRX cycles that the serving
cell does not fulfil the cell selection criterion S the UE shall initiate the
measurements of all neighbour cells indicated in the measurement control
system information, regardless of the measurement rules currently limiting UE
measurement activities.
If the UE has not found any new suitable cell based on searches and

serving cell using at least 2 measurements, which are taken so that the time
difference between the measurements is at least T~measureTDD~/2 (see table
4.1B).
If the UE has evaluated in N~serv~ successive measurements that the serving
cell does not fulfil the cell selection criterion S, the UE shall initiate the
measurements of all neighbour cells indicated in the measurement control
system information, regardless of the measurement rules currently limiting UE
measurement activities.
If the UE has not found any new suitable cell based the on searches and
measurements of the neighbour cells indicated in the measurement control
system information for 12 s, the UE shall initiate cell selection procedures
for the selected PLMN as defined in [18].
On transition from CELL_DCH to CELL_PCH/URA_PCH, if a UE cannot find a

#### 4.2.2.2 Measurement of intra-frequency cells
##### 4.2.2.2.1 3.84 Mcps option
The UE shall measure PCCPCH RSCP at least every T~measureTDD~ (see table 4.1)
for intra-frequency cells that are identified and measured according to the
measurement rules. T~measureTDD~ is defined in Table 4.1. The UE shall filter
PCCPCH RSCP measurements of each measured intra-frequency cell using at least
2 measurements, which are taken so that the time difference between the first
measurement and the last measurements used for filtering is at least
T~measureTDD~/2.
The filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that an
intra-frequency cell has become better ranked than the serving cell within
T~evaluateTDD~ (see table 4.1), from the moment the intra-frequency cell
became at least 2 dB better ranked than the current serving cell, provided
that Treselection timer is set to zero.
If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the intra frequency cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this intra
frequency cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains better ranked
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.
If the UE is receiving the MTCH, the UE shall be able to identify new intra-
frequency cells and take them into use for MTCH combing purposes as defined in
section 8.4.2.2.1.
##### 4.2.2.2.2 1.28 Mcps option
The UE shall measure PCCPCH RSCP at least every T~measureNTDD~ (see table
4.1A) for intra-frequency cells that are identified and measured according to
the measurement rules. T~measureNTDD~ is defined in Table 4.1A. The UE shall
filter PCCPCH RSCP measurements of each measured intra-frequency cell using at
least 2 measurements, which are taken so that the time difference between the
first measurement and the last measurement used for filtering is at least
T~measureNTDD~/2.
The filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that an
intra-frequency cell has become better ranked than the serving cell within
T~evaluateNTDD~ (see table 4.1A), from the moment the intra-frequency cell
became at least 3 dB better ranked than the current serving cell, provided
that Treselection timer is set to zero.
If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the intra frequency cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this intra
frequency cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains better ranked
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.
If the UE is receiving the MTCH, the UE shall be able to identify new intra-
frequency cells and take them into use for MTCH combing purposes as defined in
section 8.4A.2.2.1.
##### 4.2.2.2.3 7.68 Mcps option
The UE shall measure PCCPCH RSCP at least every T~measureTDD~ (see table 4.1B)
for intra-frequency cells that are identified and measured according to the
measurement rules. T~measureTDD~ is defined in Table 4.1B. The UE shall filter
PCCPCH RSCP measurements of each measured intra-frequency cell using at least
2 measurements, which are taken so that the time difference between the first
measurement and the last measurements used for filtering is at least
T~measureTDD~/2.
The filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that an
intra-frequency cell has become better ranked than the serving cell within
T~evaluateTDD~ (see table 4.1B), from the moment the intra-frequency cell
became at least 2 dB better ranked than the current serving cell, provided
that Treselection timer is set to zero.
If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the intra frequency cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this intra
frequency cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains better ranked
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.
#### 4.2.2.3 Measurement of inter-frequency TDD cells
If priority information for UTRA TDD carrier frequencies is provided in the
measurement control systems information and Srxlev~ServingCell~ >
S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for any higher priority UTRA inter-
frequency cells at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If higher priority
UTRA cells are found by the higher priority search, they shall be measured at
least every (N~carrier~-1) * T~measureTDD~ for 3.84 Mcps option and 7.68 Mcps
option, (N~carrier~-1) * T~measureNTDD~ for 1.28 Mcps option. If, after
detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that
reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously
measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection.
However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later in
this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any determination
that it may stop measuring the cell. If priority information for UTRA TDD
carrier frequencies is provided in the measurement control systems information
and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \
S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for any higher priority UTRA TDD
3.84 Mcps option cells at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If higher priority
UTRA TDD 3.84 Mcps option cells are found by the higher priority search, they
shall be measured at least every (N~carrier~-1) * T~measureTDD~. If, after
detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that
reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously
measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection.
However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later in
this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any determination
that it may stop measuring the cell. If priority information for UTRA TDD
carrier frequencies is provided in the measurement control systems information
and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \
S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for any higher priority UTRA TDD
1.28 Mcps option cells at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If higher priority
UTRA TDD 1.28 Mcps option cells are found by the higher priority search, they
shall be measured at least every (N~carrier~-1) * T~measureNTDD~. If, after
detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that
reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously
measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection.
However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later in
this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any determination
that it may stop measuring the cell. If priority information for UTRA TDD
carrier frequencies is provided in the measurement control systems information
and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \
S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for any higher priority UTRA TDD
3.84 Mcps option cells at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If higher priority
UTRA TDD 3.84 Mcps option cells are found by the higher priority search, they
shall be measured at least every (N~carrier~-1) * T~measureTDD~. If, after
detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that
reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously
measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection.
However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later in
this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any determination
that it may stop measuring the cell. If priority information for UTRA TDD
carrier frequencies is provided in the measurement control systems information
and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \
S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for any higher priority UTRA TDD
7.86 Mcps option cells at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If higher priority
UTRA TDD 7.86 Mcps option cells are found by the higher priority search, they
shall be measured at least every (N~carrier~-1) * T~measureTDD~. If, after
detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that
reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously
measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection.
However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later in
this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any determination
that it may stop measuring the cell. If priority information for UTRA TDD
carrier frequencies is provided in the measurement control systems information
and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \
S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for any higher priority UTRA FDD
cells at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where T~higher_priority_search~
is described in section 4.2.2. If higher priority UTRA FDD cells are found by
the higher priority search, they shall be measured at least every
(N~carrier~-1) * T~measureFDD~. If, after detecting a cell in a higher
priority search, it is determined that reselection has not occurred then the
UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell to evaluate the
ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum measurement filtering
requirements specified later in this section shall still be met by the UE
before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring the cell. If
priority information for UTRA carrier frequencies is provided in the
measurement control systems information and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \ S~prioritysearch~ then
\- the UE may not search for, or measure GSM cells if the priority of GSM is
lower than the serving cell.
\- the UE shall search for and measure GSM cells if the priority of GSM is
higher than the serving cell. The minimum rate at which the UE is required to
search for and measure such layers may be reduced in this scenario to maintain
UE battery life.
If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \ _Note : If it is concluded that only blacklist, or only whitelist can be
> used for reselection to GSM then one of these bullets can be deleted._
If Srxlev~ServingCell~ > S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for GSM
BCCH carrier at least every T~higher_priority_search~ where
T~higher_priority_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. When higher priority
GSM BCCH carriers are found by the higher priority search, they shall be
measured at least every T~measure,GSM,~ and the UE shall decode the BSIC of
the GSM BCCH carrier. If, after detecting a cell in a higher priority search,
it is determined that reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required
to continuously measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility
of reselection to continuously verify the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier every
30s. However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later
in this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any determination
that it may stop measuring the cell. If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \ S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for and
measure E-UTRA layers of higher priority at least every
T~higher_priority_search~ where T~higher_priority_search~ is described in
section 4.2.2.. The minimum rate at which the UE is required to search for and

The UE shall measure RSRP at least every K~carrier~ * T~measure,EUTRA_~as
defined in table 4.2 or 4.2A or 4.2B for identified E-UTRA cells.
When higher priority cells are found by the higher priority search, they shall
be measured at least every T~measureE-UTRA~. If, after detecting a cell in a
higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not occurred
then the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell to
evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum
measurement filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still
be met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring
the cell.
If the UE detects on a E-UTRA carrier a cell whose physical identity is
indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell, the UE is not required to perform
measurements on that cell.
The UE shall filter RSRP measurements of each measured E-UTRA cell using at
least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the filtering,
at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least (K~carrier~ *
T~measure,EUTRA~)/2.
RSRP measurements of E-UTRA cells shall not be filtered over a longer period
than that specified in Table 4.2 or 4.2A or 4.2B.
The UE shall not consider an E-UTRA neighbour cell in cell reselection, if it
is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system information of
the serving cell.
For an inter-RAT E-UTRA cell that has been already detected, but that has not
been reselected to, The filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable
of evaluating that the EUTRAN cell has met reselection criterion defined in
[25] within K~carrier~ *T~evaluateEUTRA~ as specified in table 4.2 or 4.2A or
4.2B provided that the reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least 6dB
when T~reselection~ = 0.
If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and an E-UTRA cell is better
ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this E-UTRA cell for the
T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains better ranked within this duration,
then the UE shall reselect that cell.

criteria specified in TS25.304.
#### 4.2.2.7 Maximum interruption time in paging reception
##### 4.2.2.7.1 3.84 Mcps option
UE shall perform the cell re-selection with minimum interruption in monitoring
downlink channels for paging reception.
At intra-frequency cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor the downlink of
current serving cell for paging reception until the UE is capable to start
monitoring downlink channels of the target intra-frequency cell for paging
reception. The interruption time shall not exceed 50 ms.
At inter-frequency and inter-RAT cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor the
downlink of current serving cell for paging reception until the UE is capable
to start monitoring downlink channels for paging reception of the target
inter-frequency cell. For inter-frequency cell re-selection, the interruption
time shall not exceed T~SI~ + 50 ms. For inter-RAT cell re-selection the
interruption time shall not exceed T~BCCH~ + 50 ms for GSM or T~SI\ EUTRA~ +
[50ms] for E-UTRA.

## 5.3b TDD to E-UTRAN TDD Handover
### 5.3b.1 Introduction
The purpose of inter-RAT handover from UTRAN TDD to E-UTRAN TDD is to transfer
a connection between the UE and UTRAN TDD to E-UTRAN TDD. The handover
procedure is initiated from UTRAN with a RRC message (HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND). The procedure is described in TS 25.331.
Scheduled idle intervals according to the UE capability may be used to be able
to make measurements on E-UTRAN.
### 5.3b.2 Requirements
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting TDD and E-UTRAN
TDD.
#### 5.3b.2.1 Handover delay
When the UE receives a RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message with activation
time \"now\" or earlier than RRC procedure delay seconds from the end of the
last TTI containing the RRC command, the UE shall be ready to start the
transmission of the new uplink PRACH channel within D~handover~ seconds from
the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command, where:
\- D~handover~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay defined plus the
interruption time stated in section 5.3b.2.2.
The UE shall process the RRC procedures for the RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND within 50 ms, which is noted as RRC procedure delay.
If the access is delayed to an indicated activation time later than RRC
procedure delay seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command, the UE shall be ready to start the transmission of the new uplink
PRACH channel at the designated activation time + interruption time.
#### 5.3b.2.2 Interruption time
The interruption time is the time between end of the last TTI in which the UE
has received the handover command and the time the UE starts transmission of
the PRACH in the new E-UTRA cell, excluding the RRC procedure delay. This
requirement applies when UE is not required to perform any synchronisation
procedure before transmitting on the new PRACH.
When inter-RAT handover to E-UTRAN is commanded, the interruption time shall
be less than T~interrupt~:
T~interrupt~ = T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms
where
> T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the target
> cell is not already known when the handover command is received by the UE.
> If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target cell is
> unknown and signal quality is sufficient for successful cell detection on
> the first attempt, then T~search~ = 80 ms.
>
> T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH
> occasion in the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.
>
> NOTE: The actual value of T~IU~ shall depend upon the PRACH configuration
> used in the target cell.

of the timing advance.
D~TA~ equals the RRC procedure delay of the RRC message implying an adjustment
of the timing advance as defined in TS25.331 section 13.5.
### 7.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option
For 1.28 Mcps TDD the timing advance in the UE is adjusted by means of uplink
synchronization. For the random access procedure the node B commands the UE to
adjust its synchronisation shift by means of signalling the received position
of the UpPTS in the FPACH. During the connection the node B measures the
timing in the uplink and transmits a SS (Synchronization Shift) command to the
UE at least once per sub-frame.
These SS commands determined whether the UE synchronization shift is either
left unchanged, or adjusted 1 step up or 1 step down. The step size of the SS
adjustment is (k/8)Tc where k (=1,2, ...,8) is signalled by higher layer
signalling.
#### 7.1.2.1 Uplink synchronization control requirements for UE for 1.28 Mcps
TDD option
Uplink synchronization control is the ability of the UE transmitter to adjust
its TX timing in accordance with one or more SS commands received in the
downlink.
##### 7.1.2.1.1 Uplink synchronization control steps
The SS step is the change in UE transmission timing in response to a single SS
command, SS_cmd, received by the UE.
###### **7.1.2.1.1.1 Minimum requirement**
The UE transmitter shall have the capability of changing the transmission
timing with a step size of 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, ..., 1 chip according to the value
of Δ ~SS~, within n=(1,2,...,6) time slots excluding special timeslots (DwPTS,
GP, UpPTS) after the SS_cmd arrived (closed loop). For the open loop any step
being a multiple of 1/8 chip has to be allowed.
a) The minimum transmission timing step Δ ~SS,min~ due to closed loop uplink
synchronization control shall be within the range shown in Table 7.1.
b) In case uplink synchronization control implies larger adjustment than the
minimum step the UE shall perform a multiple integer number of the minimum
step. Within the implementation grid of the applicable timing steps of the UE
the step being closest to the required step should be executed.

### 7.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option
#### 7.1.3.1 Introduction
The timing advance is initiated from UTRAN with an RRC message that implies an
adjustement of the timing advance, see TS 25.331 section 8.6.6.26.
To update timing advance of a UE, the UTRAN measures RX Timing deviation. The
measurements are defined in TS 25.225 and measurement accuracies are specified
in section 9.
#### 7.1.3.2 Requirements

##### 7.1.3.2.2 Timing Advance adjustment delay
The UE shall adjust the timing of its transmission at the designated
activation time, when the indicated activation time is later than D~TA~ msec
from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC message implying an adjustment
of the timing advance.
D~TA~ equals the RRC procedure delay of the RRC message implying an adjustment
of the timing advance as defined in TS25.331 section 13.5.
## 7.2 Cell synchronization accuracy
### 7.2.1 Definition
Cell synchronization accuracy is defined as the maximum deviation in frame
start times between any pair of cells on the same frequency that have
overlapping coverage areas.

## 7.3 UE Transmit Timing for 3.84 Mcps TDD Option
### 7.3.1 Definition
UE transmit timing is defined as the frame start time of uplink transmissions
relative to the downlink frame timing at zero propagation delay with timing
advance turned off. The reference point for UE transmit timing shall be the
antenna connector. This is applicable for the AWGN propagation condition. In
the case of multi-path fading conditions, the reference point for UE transmit
timing shall be the first significant path of the received PCCPCH.
### 7.3.2 Minimum Requirement
The UE transmit timing error shall be within 0 to +3 chips for the AWGN
propagation condition.

relative to the downlink frame timing at zero propagation delay with timing
advance turned off. The reference point for UE transmit timing shall be the
antenna connector. This is applicable for the AWGN propagation condition. In
the case of multi-path fading conditions, the reference point for UE transmit
timing shall be the first significant path of the received PCCPCH.
### 7.3A.2 Minimum Requirement

For UE timers T3xx, T~barred~, Treselection, Penalty_time, T~CRmax~,
T~CrmaxHyst~ [16], UE shall comply with the timer accuracies according to
Table 7.2.
The requirements are only related to the actual timing measurements internally
in the UE. They do not include the following:
\- Inaccuracy in the start and stop conditions of a timer (e.g. UE reaction
time to detect that start and stop conditions of a timer is fulfilled), or
\- Inaccuracies due to restrictions in observability of start and stop
conditions of a UE timer (e.g. TTI alignment when UE sends messages at timer
expiry).
Table 7.2
* * *
Timer value [s] Accuracy timer value \ \- TDD mode cells distributed on up to 2 additional TDD carriers and
>
> \- Depending on UE capability, FDD mode cells, distributed on up to 3 FDD
> carriers.
\- Depending on UE capability, 32 inter RAT GSM cells,
\- Depending on UE capability, 4 E-UTRA FDD cells per E-UTRA FDD carrier for
up to 4 E-UTRA FDD carriers; and
\- Depending on UE capability, 4 E-UTRA TDD cells per E-UTRA TDD carrier for
up to 4 E-UTRA TDD carriers.
The requirements in section 9 are applicable for a UE performing measurements
according to this section.
For measurements on intra- and inter-frequency TDD, inter-frequency FDD and
GSM cells, idle intervals as described in [14] can be used. The time
T~measure~ per 480 ms period available for these measurements is the sum of
the duration of all idle intervals during any given 480 ms period, i.e. the
amount of time not used by the UE for receiving in active DL timeslots or for
transmission in active UL timeslots. Note that Beacon timeslots of the serving
cell can be located inside idle intervals and that implementation margin due
to frequency switching is not taken into account for T~measure~.
The requirements in this section are based upon the assumption, that the time
durations T~intra~ and T~inter~ during any given 480 ms period for the purpose
of measurements on intra-frequency TDD cells and for measurements on inter-
frequency TDD, inter-frequency FDD and GSM cells are respectively,
$T_{\text{intra}} = \left\lbrack \text{96} + \text{24} \cdot \text{Floor\
}\left{ \frac{M_{\text{intra}} + 3}{4} \right} \right\rbrack$ ms
$T_{\text{inter}} = \text{\ 480\ ms} - T_{\text{intra}}$
where, M~intra~ is equal to the number of intra-frequency TDD cells in the
neighbour list
The time duration T~inter~ shall be equally shared for inter-frequency
measurements on the different modes and systems which the UE has capability
for and that are in the monitored set signalled by UTRAN, i.e.
$T_{\text{inter}} = N_{\text{TDD\ }} \cdot T_{\text{TDD\ inter}} +
N_{\text{FDD\ }} \cdot T_{\text{FDD\ inter}} + N_{\text{GSM}} \cdot
T_{\text{GSM\ inter}}$
For this, the following parameters are defined,
T~TDD\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of TDD inter-
frequency measurements.
T~FDD\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of FDD inter-
frequency measurements.
T~GSM\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of GSM
measurements.
N~TDD~ is equal to 1 if there are inter-frequency TDD cells in the neighbour
list, equal to 0 otherwise.
N~FDD~ is equal to 1 if the UE has capability for FDD and if there are inter-
frequency FDD cells in the neighbour list, equal to 0 otherwise.
N~GSM~ is equal to 1 if the UE has capability for GSM and if there are GSM
cells in the neighbour list, equal to 0 otherwise.
#### 8.1.2.2 TDD intra frequency measurements
During the CELL_DCH state, the UE shall continuously measure identified intra
frequency TDD cells and search for new intra frequency TDD cells in the
monitored set. In case the UTRAN requests the UE to report detected set cells,

and active set. Cells, which are neither included in the active set nor in the
monitored set, and are identified by the UE belong to the detected set
according to [16].
In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply, the
Beacon timeslots of the intra-frequency TDD cells indicated in the measurement
control information shall either be synchronised with the Beacon timeslots of
the serving cell or non-overlapping in time with the active UL timeslots used

TDD cell at least once every frame for the slot allocation case in use in this
cell. The UE shall be capable of intra frequency measurements during active DL
timeslots.
##### 8.1.2.2.1 Identification of a new cell
The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency TDD cell

T~measurement\ period\ intra~ = 200 ms
The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting these measurements to
higher layers with the measurement period T~measurement\ period\ intra~.

ms.
When inter-frequency measurements are required by the network, the UE shall be
capable of performing Timeslot ISCP measurements for at least Y~measurement\
intra\ ISCP~ different combinations, where Y~measurement\ intra\ ISCP~ is
defined in the following equation. Any Timeslot ISCP measurement that could
not be performed during that measurement period, shall be measured in the
following measurement periods. The measurement accuracy of the Timeslot ISCP
measurement shall be as specified in the section 9.

intra\ ISCP}}} \right}$
whereby function Floor(x) takes the integer part of x.

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report, until the UE starts to transmit the
measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that the
measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH . The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
For P-CCPCH RSCP measurements, the event triggered measurement reporting
delay, on cells belonging to the monitored set, measured without L3 filtering
shall be less than T ~identify\ intra~ defined in Section 8.1.2.2.1. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected..
If a cell, belonging to the monitored set has been detectable at least for the
time period T~identify\ intra~ and then enters the reporting range, the event
triggered P-CCPCH RSCP measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~measurement_period\ intra~ when the L3 filter has not been used and the UE
P-CCPCH RSCP measurement capabilities of section 8.1.2.2.1 are valid.
#### 8.1.2.3 TDD inter frequency measurements
When signalled by UTRAN during CELL_DCH state, the UE shall continuously
measure detected inter-frequency TDD cells and search for new inter-frequency

control information shall be non-overlapping in time with the active DL and UL
timeslots used by the UE for reception and transmission such that the UE can
measure an inter-frequency cell TDD cell at least once every frame for the

\cdot N_{\text{Freq}} \right}\text{ms}$
If the UE does not require idle intervals to perform inter-frequency TDD
measurements, the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable inter-
frequency TDD cell belonging to the monitored set within 5000 ms.
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.
##### 8.1.2.3.2 P-CCPCH RSCP measurement period
When idle intervals are used for TDD inter frequency measurements, the UE
shall be capable of performing P-CCPCH RSCP measurements for X~measurement\
TDD\ inter~ inter-frequency TDD cells per TDD frequency of the monitored set.
The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to higher
layers with measurement accuracy as specified in section 9 and with a
measurement period of T~measurement\ inter~.

length equal to or greater than 3 timeslots less 2*0.5 ms implementation
margin for frequency switching per idle interval completely overlaps in time
with the Beacon timeslot of the inter-frequency TDD cell.
N~basic_identify_TDD\ inter~ = 80. This is a number of measurement

#### 8.1.2.5 GSM measurements
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting TDD and GSM.
In CELL_DCH state, measurements opportunities for GSM measurements are

Measurements on GSM cells can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified.
a) In CELL_DCH state, when signaled by UTRAN and when idle intervals are used
for GSM measurements, the UE shall continuously measure GSM cells and search
for new GSM cells given in the monitored set.
\- In section 8.1.2.1 the split of measurements between different modes and
systems is defined. Every second measurement opportunity scheduled for GSM
measurements, as given by 8.1.2.1 shall be allocated for GSM initial BSIC
identification.
\- The remaining measurements opportunities scheduled for GSM measurements
shall be used as follows. 3 measurement opportunities out of 4 shall be
allocated for GSM carrier RSSI measurements and 1 out of 4 shall be allocated
for GSM BSIC reconfirmation. The scheduling of measurement opportunities
between GSM carrier RSSI measurements and GSM BSIC reconfirmation is up to the
UE.

idle intervals to perform GSM measurements, the UE shall measure all GSM cells
present in the monitored set
\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel is
assigned in [21] shall apply. This is further detailed in the following sub-
sections.
##### 8.1.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI
a) For a UE using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

number of GSM carrier RSSI measurements specified in table 8.1.
In the CELL_DCH state the measurement period, T~measurement\ period\ GSM~, for
the GSM carrier RSSI measurement is 480 ms.
The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV in
[21], when the given measurement time allows the UE to the take at least 3 GSM
carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set during the
measurement period.

idle interval 3 1 4 2 5 3 6 4 7 6 8 7 9 8 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 14
* * *
In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per GSM
carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many GSM
carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3 samples
per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during that
measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement periods.
This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting period to higher
layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the measurement period.
b) For a UE not using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly
distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received signal level
measurement samples are required per GSM carrier RSSI measurement. The
measurement period shall be 480 ms.
##### 8.1.2.5.2 BSIC verification {#bsic-verification .list-paragraph}
a) For a UE using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into the
following two tasks:
1) Initial BSIC identification: Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding
the BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about the relative
timing between the TDD and GSM cell.. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in section 8.1.2.5.2.1.
2) BSIC re-confirmation: Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after
initial BSIC identification is performed.. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in section 8.1.2.5.2.2.
Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified, the UE shall
be able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those cells where the
verification of BSIC has been successful.
If the UTRAN requests measurements on a GSM cell with BSIC verified, the UE
shall behave as follows:
\- The UE shall perform GSM carrier RSSI measurements according to Section
8.1.2.5.1 and the UE shall perform measurement reporting as defined in Section
8.6.7.6 of [16].
\- The UE shall use the last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement results
for arranging GSM cells in signal strength order for performing BSIC
identification.
\- The UE shall perform BSIC re-confirmation according to Section 8.1.2.5.2.2
The UE shall perform event evaluation for event-triggered reporting after the
BSIC has been verified for a GSM cell. The UE shall use the last available GSM
carrier RSSI measurement results in event evaluation and event-triggered
reporting. Periodic reports shall be triggered according to the given
reporting period even if the BSIC of a GSM cell has not been verified as
defined in Sections 8.6.7.5 and 8.6.7.6 of [16]. Non verified BSIC shall be
indicated in the measurement report.
The UE shall consider the BSIC of a GSM cell to be \"verified\", if it has
decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one time
(initial BSIC identification). From that time instant, the UE shall attempt to
re-confirm the BSIC at least once every T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds.
Otherwise, the UE shall consider the BSIC of the GSM cell to be \"non-

The time requirement for initial BSIC identification, T~identify\ abort~, and
the BSIC re-confirmation interval T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the
sections below.
The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC for the purpose of initial BSIC
identification or BSIC reconfirmation within an idle interval, when the time
difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation burst at the
UE and the middle of the idle interval is within the limits specified in Table
8.1.AA.

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
[20].
b) For a UE not using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, the UE shall consider it
as \"verified\", otherwise it shall consider it as \"non-verified\".
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
[20].
###### 8.1.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification
For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall attempt to
decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the 8 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM
cells indicated in the measurement control information. The UE shall give
priority for BSIC decodingattempts in decreasing signal strength order to BSIC
carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH
carrier having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value after layer 3
filtering. The GSM signal strength levels used in BSIC identification for
arranging GSM cells in signal strength order shall be based on the latest GSM
carrier RSSI measurement results available.
If the BSIC of a GSM BCCH carriers has been successfully decoded the UE shall
inmediately continue BSIC identification with the next BCCH carrier, in signal
strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has been
successfully identified shall be moved to the BSIC re-confirmation procedure.
If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier within
T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC decoding attempts for that
GSMBCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform BSIC decoding of the
next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which
the BSIC decoding failed shall not be re-considered for BSIC decoding until
BSIC decoding attempts have been made for all the rest of the 8 strongest GSM
BCCH carriers in the monitored set with unknown BSIC.
Where T~identify\ abort~ = 5000 ms.
###### 8.1.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation
The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC re-confirmation.
The UE shall maintain the timing information of at least 8 identified GSM
cells. Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC decoding.
The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is decoded.
If more than one BSIC can be decoded within the same measurement window given
by the idle intervals, priority shall be given to the least recently decoded
BSIC.
If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts or if the UE
has not been able to re-confirm the BSIC for a GSM BCCH carrier within T~re-
confirm_abort~ seconds, the UE shall abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts
for that GSM BCCH carrier. The GSM BCCH carrier shall be treated as a new GSM
BCCH carrier with unidentified BSIC and the GSM BCCH carrier shall be moved to
the initial BSIC decoding procedure, see section 8.1.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be
able to make BSIC re-confirmation attempts for the 8 strongest GSM cells in
the monitored list.
Where T~re-confirm\ abort~ =5000 ms.
##### 8.1.2.5.3 Periodic Reporting
Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.
##### 8.1.2.5.4 Event Triggered Reporting
Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria is not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit the
measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that the
measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
The event triggered reporting delay requirement is valid, when the UE for each
GSM carrier in the monitored set can take the required number of samples
during the measurement period T~measurement\ period\ GSM~ (see section
8.1.2.5.1).
The event triggered measurement reporting delay for a GSM cell with verified
BSIC, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than 2*T~measurement\
period\ GSM~, where T~measurement\ period\ GSM~ is defined in Section
8.1.2.5.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected. For
a GSM cell with non-verified BSIC an additional delay according to section
8.1.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification can be expected.
#### 8.1.2.6 TDD Synchronisation to new cells

frequency TDD cell shall be considered detectable when, $\ \left( \frac{P -
\text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \geq - 8\text{dB}$
$\ \left( \frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \geq -
\text{13}\text{dB}$
where the received P-CCPCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as
$\ \left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} =
\left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\
\text{dB}} - \frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\
\text{dB}}$
and the received SCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as
$\ \left( \frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} = \left(
\frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} -
\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$

##### 8.1A.2.3.3 Periodic Reporting
Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.
##### 8.1A.2.3.4 Event Triggered Reporting
Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria is not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report, until the UE starts to transmit the
measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that that
the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH.
This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH . The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering
shall be less than T ~identify\ inter~ defined in Section 8.1A.2.3.1. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
#### 8.1A.2.4 FDD measurements
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting 1.28Mcps TDD and
FDD.
In the CELL_DCH state when FDD inter frequency measurements are scheduled the
UE shall continuously measure identified inter frequency FDD cells and search
for new inter frequency FDD cells indicated in the measurement control
information.
##### 8.1A.2.4.1 Identification of a new cell
When idle intervals are used for inter-frequency FDD measurements, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable cell belonging to the monitored set
within
$T_{\text{identify\ FDD}\ \text{\ inter}} = \text{Max}\left{
\text{5000},T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD\ inter}} \cdot
\frac{T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period\ \ FDD\ inter}}}{T_{\text{FDD\
inter}}} \cdot N_{\text{Freq}} \right}\text{ms}$
IF the UE does not require idle intervals to perform inter-frequency FDD
measurements, the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable inter-
frequency FDD cell belonging to the monitored set within 5000 ms.
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
A cell shall be considered detectable when CPICH Ec/Io [>]{.underline} -20 dB,
SCH_Ec/Io [>]{.underline} -17 dB and SCH_Ec/Ior is equally divided between
primary synchronisation code and secondary synchronisation code.
##### 8.1A.2.4.2 UE CPICH measurement capability
When idle intervals are used for FDD inter frequency measurements, the UE
physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to higher layers
with measurement accuracy as specified in sub-clause 9 with measurement period
given by
If the UE does not need idle intervals to perform FDD measurements, the
measurement period for inter frequency measurements is 480 ms.
The UE shall be capable of performing FDD measurements for X~basic\
measurement\ FDD\ inter~ inter-frequency cells per FDD frequency of the
monitored set, and the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting
measurements to higher layers with the measurement period of
T~Measurement_FDDInter.~
X~basic\ measurement\ FDDinter~ = 6
T~Measurement_Period\ FDD\ inter~ = 480 ms. The period used for calculating
the measurement period T~measurement_FDD\ inter~ for inter frequency CPICH
measurements.
T~FDD~ ~inter:~ This is the minimum time that is available for inter frequency
measurements, during the period T~Measurement_Period\ FDD\ inter~ with an
arbitrarily chosen timing. The minimum time depends on the channel allocation
and is calculated by assuming 2*0.1 ms for implementation margin (for the
description of the idle intervals see Annex A of 25.225). It is assumed for
the requirement that the slot allocation allows measurement windows in the
idle periods to be of minimum duration necessary to perform the measurements.
T~basic_identify_FDD,inter~ = 800 ms. This is the time period used in the
inter frequency equation where the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify
a new FDD cell is defined.
T~basic_measurement_FDD\ inter~ = 50 ms. This is the time period used in the
equation for defining the measurement period for inter frequency CPICH
measurements.
N~Freq~: Number of FDD frequencies indicated in the inter frequency
measurement control information.
##### 8.1A.2.4.3 Periodic Reporting
Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.
##### 8.1A.2.4.4 Event Triggered Reporting
Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit the
measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that that
the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH.
This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay
uncertanty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering
shall be less than T ~identify\ FDD\ inter~ defined in Section 8.1A.2.4.1.
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
If a cell has been detectable at least for the time period T~identify_FDD\
inter~ and then enters the reporting range, the event triggered measurement
reporting delay shall be less than T~Measurement_Period\ FDD\ Inter~ provided
the timing to that cell has not changed more than +/-32 chips while idle
intervals have has not been available and the L3 filter has not been used.
#### 8.1A.2.5 GSM measurements
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting 1.28Mcps TDD and
GSM.
Measurements on GSM cells can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified.
1) For a UE requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements. In CELL_DCH
state when signalled by UTRAN and when idle intervals are used, the UE shall
continuously measure GSM cells and search for new GSM cells given in the
monitored set.
2) For a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements:
\- the UE shall measure all GSM cells present in the monitored set
\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel is
assigned in TS 45.008 shall apply. This is further detailed in the following
sub-sections.
##### 8.1A.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI
1) For a UE requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
An UE supporting GSM measurements using idle intervals shall meet the minimum
number of GSM RSSI carrier measurements specified in table 8.1A.
In the CELL_DCH state the measurement period, T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~,
for the GSM carrier RSSI measurement is 480 ms.
The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV in TS
45.008, when the given measurement time allows the UE to the take at least 3
GSM carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set during the
measurement period.
Table 8.1A
* * *
Idle Interval Length (timeslots) Number of GSM carrier RSSI samples in each
idle interval 3 1 4 2 5 3
* * *
For the description of the idle intervals see Annex A of 25.225.
In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per GSM
carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many GSM
carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3 samples
per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during that
measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement periods.
This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting period to higher
layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the measurement period.
2) For a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly
distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received signal level
measurement samples are required per RSSI value. The measurement period is 480
ms.
##### 8.1A.2.5.2 BSIC verification
1) For a UE requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into the
following two tasks:
1) Initial BSIC identification\ Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding
the BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about the relative
timing between the TDD and GSM cell. The UE shall trigger the initial BSIC
identification within the available idle intervals. The requirements for
Initial BSIC identification can be found in section 8.1A.2.5.2.1,\"Initial
BSIC identification\".
2) BSIC re-confirmation\ Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after
initial BSIC identification is performed. The UE shall trigger the BSIC re-
confirmation within the available idle intervals. The requirements for BSIC
re-confirmation can be found in section 8.1A.2.5.2.2, \"BSIC re-
confirmation\".
Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall be
able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those cells where the
verification of BSIC has been successful.
The UE shall use the last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement results for
arranging GSM cells in signal strength order for performing BSIC
identification. The UE shall perform event evaluation for event-triggered
reporting after the BSIC has been verified for a GSM cell. The UE shall use
the last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement results in event evaluation
and event-triggered reporting. Periodic reports shall be triggered according
to Sections 8.6.7.5 and 8.6.7.6 of [16]
The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has decoded
the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one time (initial
BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall be re-confirmed at
least once every T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds. Otherwise the BSIC of the GSM
cell is considered as \"non-verified\". The time requirement for initial BSIC
identification, T~identify\ abort~, and the BSIC re-confirmation interval
T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the sections below.
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
TS 45.005.
2) For a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, it is considered as
\"verified\", else it is considered as \"non verified\".
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
TS 45.005.
###### 8.1A.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification
For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall attempt to
decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the8 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM
cells indicated in the measurement control information. The UE shall give
priority for BSIC decoding attempts in decreasing signal strength order to
BSIC carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the
BCCH carrier having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value after layer 3
filtering. The GSM signal strength levels used in BSIC identification for
arranging GSM cells in signal strength order shall be based on the latest GSM
carrier RSSI measurement results available.
If the BSIC of a GSM BCCH carriers has been successfully decoded the UE shall
immediately continue BSIC identification with the next BCCH carrier, in signal
strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has been
successfully identified shall be moved to the BSIC re-confirmation procedure.
If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier within
T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification attempts for
that GSMBCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform BSIC
identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The GSM
BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification failed shall not be re-
considered for BSIC identification until BSIC decoding attempts have been made
for all the rest of the 8 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the monitored set
with unknown BSIC.
T~identify\ abort~ = 5000 ms. This is the time necessary to identify one new
GSM cell. It is assumed for the requirement that the slot allocation allows
measurement windows in the idle periods to be of minimum duration necessary to
perform the measurements.
###### 8.1A.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation
The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC re-confirmation.
The UE shall maintain the timing information of at least 8 identified GSM
cells. Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
identification. The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is
decoded.
For each idle interval, the UE is able to use for BSIC re-confirmation, the UE
shall attempt to decode the BSIC falling within the effective measurement
window. If more than one BSIC can be decoded within the same measurement
window given by the idle intervals, priority shall be given to the least
recently decoded BSIC.
If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts or if the UE
has not been able to re-confirm the BSIC for a GSM BCCH carrier within T~re-
confirm_abort~ seconds, the UE shall abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts
for that GSM BCCH carrier. The GSM BCCH carrier shall be treated as a new GSM
BCCH carrier with unidentified BSIC and the GSM BCCH carrier shall be moved to
the initial BSIC decoding procedure, see section 8.1A.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be
able to make BSIC re-confirmation attempts for the 8 strongest GSM cells in
the monitored list.
T~re-confirm\ abort~ =5000 ms. This is the BSIC reconfirmation interval.
It is assumed for the requirement that the slot allocation allows measurement
windows in the idle periods to be of minimum duration necessary to perform the
measurements.
###### 8.1A.2.5.2.3 Periodic Reporting
Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.
###### 8.1A.2.5.2.4 Event Triggered Reporting
Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria is not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit the
measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that that
the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH.
This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
The event triggered reporting delay requirement is valid when the UE for each
GSM carrier in the monitored set can take the required number of samples
during the measurement period T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ (see section
8.1A.2.5.1).
The event triggered measurement reporting delay for a GSM cell with verified
BSIC, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than 2*T~Measurement\
Period,\ GSM~, where T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ is defined in Section
8.1A.2.5.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected. For
a GSM cell with non-verified BSIC an additional delay according to section
8.1A.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification can be expected.

## 8.1B General Measurement Requirements in CELL_DCH State (7.68 Mcps option)
### 8.1B.1 Introduction
This section contains requirements on the UE regarding measurement reporting
in CELL_DCH state. The requirements are split in TDD intra frequency, TDD
inter frequency, FDD and GSM measurements. These measurements may be used by
the UTRAN, e.g. for handover decisions. The measurements are defined in [14],
the measurement model is defined in [15] and measurement accuracies are
specified in section 9. Control of measurement reporting is specified in [16]
and parallel measurements are specified in section 8.2B. For the description
of the idle intervals see [14].
### 8.1B.2 Requirements
#### 8.1B.2.1 UE Measurement Capability
The UE shall be able to monitor up to
\- 32 intra frequency TDD cells (including serving cell), and
\- 32 inter frequency cells, including
> \- TDD mode cells distributed on up to 2 additional TDD carriers and
>
> \- Depending on UE capability, FDD mode cells, distributed on up to 3 FDD
> carriers.
\- Depending on UE capability, 32 inter RAT GSM cells.
\- Depending on UE capability, 4 E-UTRA FDD cells per E-UTRA FDD carrier for
up to 4 E-UTRA FDD carriers; and
\- Depending on UE capability, 4 E-UTRA TDD cells per E-UTRA TDD carrier for
up to 4 E-UTRA TDD carriers.
The requirements in section 9 are applicable for a UE performing measurements
according to this section.
For measurements on intra- and inter-frequency TDD, inter-frequency FDD and
GSM cells, idle intervals as described in [14] can be used. The time
T~measure~ per 480 ms period available for these measurements is the sum of
the duration of all idle intervals during any given 480 ms period, i.e. the
amount of time not used by the UE for receiving in active DL timeslots or for
transmission in active UL timeslots. Note that Beacon timeslots of the serving
cell can be located inside idle intervals and that implementation margin due
to frequency switching is not taken into account for T~measure~.
The requirements in this section are based upon the assumption, that the time
durations T~intra~ and T~inter~ during any given 480 ms period for the purpose
of measurements on intra-frequency TDD cells and for measurements on inter-
frequency TDD, inter-frequency FDD and GSM cells are respectively,
$T_{\text{intra}} = \left\lbrack \text{96} + \text{24} \cdot \text{Floor\
}\left{ \frac{M_{\text{intra}} + 3}{4} \right} \right\rbrack$ ms
$T_{\text{inter}} = \text{\ 480\ ms} - T_{\text{intra}}$
where, M~intra~ is equal to the number of intra-frequency TDD cells in the
neighbour list
The time duration T~inter~ shall be equally shared for inter-frequency
measurements on the different modes and systems which the UE has capability
for and that are in the monitored set signalled by UTRAN, i.e.
$T_{\text{inter}} = N_{\text{TDD\ }} \cdot T_{\text{TDD\ inter}} +
N_{\text{FDD\ }} \cdot T_{\text{FDD\ inter}} + N_{\text{GSM}} \cdot
T_{\text{GSM\ inter}}$
For this, the following parameters are defined,
T~TDD\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of TDD inter-
frequency measurements.
T~FDD\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of FDD inter-
frequency measurements.
T~GSM\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of GSM
measurements.
N~TDD~ is equal to 1 if there are inter-frequency TDD cells in the neighbour
list, equal to 0 otherwise.
N~FDD~ is equal to 1 if the UE has capability for FDD and if there are inter-
frequency FDD cells in the neighbour list, equal to 0 otherwise.
N~GSM~ is equal to 1 if the UE has capability for GSM and if there are GSM
cells in the neighbour list, equal to 0 otherwise.
#### 8.1B.2.2 TDD intra frequency measurements
During the CELL_DCH state, the UE shall continuously measure identified intra
frequency TDD cells and search for new intra frequency TDD cells in the
monitored set. In case the UTRAN requests the UE to report detected set cells,
the UE shall also search for intra frequency TDD cells outside the monitored
and active set. Cells, which are neither included in the active set nor in the
monitored set, and are identified by the UE belong to the detected set
according to [16].
In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply, the
Beacon timeslots of the intra-frequency TDD cells indicated in the measurement
control information shall either be synchronised with the Beacon timeslots of
the serving cell or non-overlapping in time with the active UL timeslots used
by the UE for transmission, such that the UE can measure an intra-frequency
TDD cell at least once every frame for the slot allocation case in use in this
cell. The UE shall be capable of intra frequency measurements during active DL
timeslots.
##### 8.1B.2.2.1 Identification of a new cell
The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency TDD cell
belonging to the monitored set within T~identify\ intra~ ms, where T~identify\
intra~ = 800 ms.
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.
##### 8.1B.2.2.2 UE P-CCPCH RSCP measurement capability
In CELL_DCH state, the UE shall be capable of performing P-CCPCH RSCP
measurements for X~measurement\ intra~ identified intra-frequency TDD cells of
the monitored set with a measurement period for intra-frequency P-CCPCH RSCP

The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting TDD and GSM.
In CELL_DCH state, measurements opportunities for GSM measurements are
provided by means of idle intervals.
Measurements on GSM cells can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified.
a) In CELL_DCH state, when signaled by UTRAN and when idle intervals are used
for GSM measurements, the UE shall continuously measure GSM cells and search
for new GSM cells given in the monitored set.
\- In section 8.1B.2.1 the split of measurements between different modes and
systems is defined. Every second measurement opportunity scheduled for GSM
measurements, as given by 8.1B.2.1 shall be allocated for GSM initial BSIC
identification.
\- The remaining measurements opportunities scheduled for GSM measurements
shall be used as follows. 3 measurement opportunities out of 4 shall be
allocated for GSM carrier RSSI measurements and 1 out of 4 shall be allocated
for GSM BSIC reconfirmation. The scheduling of measurement opportunities
between GSM carrier RSSI measurements and GSM BSIC reconfirmation is up to the
UE.

idle intervals to perform GSM measurements, the UE shall measure all GSM cells
present in the monitored set
> \- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel is
> assigned in [21] shall apply. This is further detailed in the following sub-
> sections.
##### 8.1B.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI
a) For a UE using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
A UE supporting GSM measurements using idle intervals shall meet the minimum
number of GSM carrier RSSI measurements specified in table 8.1B.
In the CELL_DCH state the measurement period, T~measurement\ period\ GSM~, for
the GSM carrier RSSI measurement is 480 ms.
The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV in
[21], when the given measurement time allows the UE to the take at least 3 GSM
carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set during the
measurement period.
Table 8.1B
* * *
Idle interval length (timeslots) Number of GSM carrier RSSI samples in each
idle interval 3 1 4 2 5 3 6 4 7 6 8 7 9 8 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 14
* * *
In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per GSM
carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many GSM
carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3 samples
per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during that
measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement periods.
This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting period to higher
layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the measurement period.
b) For a UE not using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly
distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received signal level
measurement samples are required per GSM carrier RSSI measurement. The
measurement period shall be 480 ms.
##### 8.1B.2.5.2 BSIC verification
a) For a UE using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into the
following two tasks:
1) Initial BSIC identification: Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding
the BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about the relative
timing between the TDD and GSM cell.. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in section 8.1B.2.5.2.1.
2) BSIC re-confirmation: Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after
initial BSIC identification is performed.. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in section 8.1B.2.5.2.2.
Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified, the UE shall
be able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those cells where the
verification of BSIC has been successful.
If the UTRAN requests measurements on a GSM cell with BSIC verified, the UE
shall behave as follows:
\- The UE shall perform GSM carrier RSSI measurements according to Section
8.1B.2.5.1 and the UE shall perform measurement reporting as defined in
Section 8.6.7.6 of [16].
\- The UE shall use the last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement results
for arranging GSM cells in signal strength order for performing BSIC
identification.
\- The UE shall perform BSIC re-confirmation according to Section 8.1B.2.5.2.2
The UE shall perform event evaluation for event-triggered reporting after the
BSIC has been verified for a GSM cell. The UE shall use the last available GSM
carrier RSSI measurement results in event evaluation and event-triggered
reporting. Periodic reports shall be triggered according to the given
reporting period even if the BSIC of a GSM cell has not been verified as
defined in Sections 8.6.7.5 and 8.6.7.6 of [16]. Non verified BSIC shall be
indicated in the measurement report.
The UE shall consider the BSIC of a GSM cell to be \"verified\", if it has
decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one time
(initial BSIC identification). From that time instant, the UE shall attempt to
re-confirm the BSIC at least once every T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds.
Otherwise, the UE shall consider the BSIC of the GSM cell to be \"non-
verified\".
The time requirement for initial BSIC identification, T~identify\ abort~, and
the BSIC re-confirmation interval T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the
sections below.
The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC for the purpose of initial BSIC
identification or BSIC reconfirmation within an idle interval, when the time
difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation burst at the
UE and the middle of the idle interval is within the limits specified in Table
8.1C.
Table 8.1C
* * *
Idle Interval Length (timeslots) Maximum time difference [μs] 3 ± 65 4 ± 398 5
± 732 6 ± 1065 7 ± 1398 8 ± 1732 9 ± 2065 10 ± 2398 11 ± 2732 12 ± 3065 13 ±
3398
* * *
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
[20].
b) For a UE not using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements
If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, the UE shall consider it
as \"verified\", otherwise it shall consider it as \"non-verified\".
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
[20].
###### 8.1B.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification
For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall attempt to
decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the 8 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM
cells indicated in the measurement control information. The UE shall give
priority for BSIC decodingattempts in decreasing signal strength order to BSIC
carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH
carrier having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value after layer 3
filtering. The GSM signal strength levels used in BSIC identification for
arranging GSM cells in signal strength order shall be based on the latest GSM
carrier RSSI measurement results available.
If the BSIC of a GSM BCCH carriers has been successfully decoded the UE shall
inmediately continue BSIC identification with the next BCCH carrier, in signal
strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has been
successfully identified shall be moved to the BSIC re-confirmation procedure.
If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier within
T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC decoding attempts for that
GSMBCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform BSIC decoding of the
next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which
the BSIC decoding failed shall not be re-considered for BSIC decoding until
BSIC decoding attempts have been made for all the rest of the 8 strongest GSM
BCCH carriers in the monitored set with unknown BSIC.
Where T~identify\ abort~ = 5000 ms.
###### 8.1B.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation
The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC re-confirmation.
The UE shall maintain the timing information of at least 8 identified GSM
cells. Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC decoding.
The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is decoded.
If more than one BSIC can be decoded within the same measurement window given
by the idle intervals, priority shall be given to the least recently decoded
BSIC.
If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts or if the UE
has not been able to re-confirm the BSIC for a GSM BCCH carrier within T~re-
confirm_abort~ seconds, the UE shall abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts
for that GSM BCCH carrier. The GSM BCCH carrier shall be treated as a new GSM
BCCH carrier with unidentified BSIC and the GSM BCCH carrier shall be moved to
the initial BSIC decoding procedure, see section 8.1B.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be
able to make BSIC re-confirmation attempts for the 8 strongest GSM cells in
the monitored list.
Where T~re-confirm\ abort~ =5000 ms.
##### 8.1B.2.5.3 Periodic Reporting
Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.
##### 8.1B.2.5.4 Event Triggered Reporting
Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria is not fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event that
will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit the
measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that the
measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.
The event triggered reporting delay requirement is valid, when the UE for each
GSM carrier in the monitored set can take the required number of samples
during the measurement period T~measurement\ period\ GSM~ (see section
8.1B.2.5.1).
The event triggered measurement reporting delay for a GSM cell with verified
BSIC, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than 2*T~measurement\
period\ GSM~, where T~measurement\ period\ GSM~ is defined in Section
8.1B.2.5.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected. For
a GSM cell with non-verified BSIC an additional delay according to section
8.1B.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification can be expected.
#### 8.1B.2.6 TDD Synchronisation to new cells
For the requirements in section 8 and 9 to apply, an intra-frequency or inter-
frequency TDD cell shall be considered detectable when, $\ \left( \frac{P -
\text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \geq -
\text{11}\text{dB}$
$\ \left( \frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \geq -
\text{13}\text{dB}$
where the received P-CCPCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as
$\ \left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} =
\left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\
\text{dB}} - \frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\
\text{dB}}$
and the received SCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as
$\ \left( \frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} = \left(
\frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} -
\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$
and SCH_Ec/Ior is equally divided between primary synchronisation code and the
sum of all secondary synchronisation codes, where the secondary
synchronisation codes are also equally divided.

FDD}}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN\ FDD}}}\ \text{ms}$;
If the UE does not need idle intervals to perform E-UTRAN FDD measurements,
the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable E-UTRAN FDD cell within
$T_{\text{Basic_Identify_E-UTRAN\ F}\text{DD}}$ ms.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event that
will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes that
the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH.
This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the
measurement report.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering
shall be less than T~identify\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in Section 8.1B.2.7.1.
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
If a cell has been detectable at least for the time period T~identify\
E-UTRAN\ FDD~ and then enters or leaves the reporting range, the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement_Period_E-UTRAN_FDD~ provided the timing to that cell has not
changed more than ±50 T~S~ while idel interval has not been available and the
L3 filter has not been used.
#### 8.1B.2.8 E-UTRAN TDD measurements
The requirements in this section apply only to UEs supporting 7.68Mcps TDD and
E-UTRAN TDD.
1) For a UE requiring idle intervals to perform E-UTRAN TDD measurements. In
CELL_DCH state when signalled by UTRAN and when idle intervals are used, the
UE shall continuously measure previously detected E-UTRAN TDD cells and search
for new E-UTRAN TDD cells.
2) For a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform E-UTRAN TDD measurements:
\- the UE shall measure either all E-UTRAN TDD cells present in the monitored
set or, if only frequencies are provided in the neighbour cell list, the
strongest cells present in the detected set, up to the monitoring capabilities
of the UE.
\- the relevant requirements for E-UTRAN RRC_CONNECTED mode specified in 3GPP
TS 36.133 [24] shall apply. This is further detailed in the following
subclauses 8.1B.2.8.1.
##### 8.1B.2.8.1 Identification of a new cell
When idle intervals are used for E-UTRAN measurements, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable E-UTRAN TDD cell within
$T_{\text{Identify\ E-UTRAN}\text{\ TDD}} = T_{\text{Basic_Identify_E-UTRAN\
TDD}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement_Period_E-UTRAN\
TDD}}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN\ TDD}}}\ \text{ms}$;
If the UE does not need idle intervals to perform E-UTRAN TDD measurements,
the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable E-UTRAN TDD cell within
$T_{\text{Basic_Identify_E-UTRAN\ T}\text{DD}}$ ms.
Where:
> T~E-UTRAN\ TDD~: This is the minimum time that is available for E-UTRAN TDD
> measurements during the measurement period T~Measurement_Period_E-UTRAN\
> TDD~ with an arbitrarily chosen timing. The minimum time per idle interval
> is calculated by assuming 2*0.5 ms for implementation margin.
T~Basic_Identify_E-UTRAN\ TDD~ = 480ms
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
An E-UTRAN TDD cell shall be considered detectable when
> \- RSRP\|~dBm~ and RSRP Ês/Iot, according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
> Band
\- Other RSRP and RSRQ related side condition given in Section 9.1 of [24] are
fulfilled for a corresponding Band[,]{.underline}
\- SCH_RP\|~dBm~ and SCH Ês/Iot, according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
Band
##### 8.1B.2.8.2 E-UTRAN RSRP and RSRQ measurement period
When idle intervals are scheduled for E-UTRAN TDD measurements the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to higher layers with
measurement accuracy as specified in sub-clause 9.1.1.5a and 9.1.1.5b with
measurement period of T~Measurement_Period_E-UTRAN\ TDD~ = 480 x N~Freq~ ms
where N~Freq~ is the number of TDD frequencies indicated in the E-UTRAN
measurement control information.
The UE shall be capable of performing RSRP and RSRQ measurements of at least 4
E-UTRAN TDD cells per E-UTRAN TDD frequency for up to 4 E-UTRAN TDD
frequencies.
##### 8.1B.2.8.3 Periodic reporting
Reported measurements contained in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.
##### 8.1B.2.8.4 Void
##### 8.1B.2.8.5 Event Triggered reporting
Reported measurements contained in event triggered measurement reports shall
meet the requirements in section 9.
The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long as no
reporting criteria are fulfilled.
The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event that
will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes that
the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH.
This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay
uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the
measurement report.
The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3 filtering
shall be less than T~Identify\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in Section 8.1B.2.8.1.
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
If a cell has been detectable at least for the time period T~Identify\
E-UTRAN\ TDD~ and then enters or leaves the reporting range, the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement_Period_E-UTRAN_TDD~ provided the timing to that cell has not
changed more than ±50 T~S~ while idel interval has not been available and the
L3 filter has not been used.

the performance requirements defined in section 9.
The UE can be requested to make measurements under different measurement
identities. Each Measurement Identity corresponds to either event based

or different Event Identities, is counted as separate reporting criterion in
Table 8.6.
The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to Table 8.6. The same type of events (e.g.
events 1G) are counted as different events if either any of the parameters

## 8.4 Measurements in CELL_FACH State (3.84 Mcps option)
### 8.4.1 Introduction
This section contains requirements on the UE regarding measurement reporting
in CELL_FACH state. The requirements are split in TDD intra frequency, TDD
inter frequency, FDD and GSM measurements. These measurements may be used by
the UTRAN, e.g. for handover decisions. The measurements are defined in [14],
the measurement model is defined in [15] and measurement accuracies are
specified in section 9. Control of measurement reporting is specified in [16]
and parallel measurements are specified in section 8.2. For the description of
the idle intervals see [14].
### 8.4.2 Requirements
#### 8.4.2.1 UE Measurement Capability
The UE shall be able to monitor up to
\- 32 intra frequency TDD cells (including serving cell), and
\- 32 inter frequency cells, including
> \- TDD mode cells distributed on up to 2 additional TDD carriers and
>
> \- Depending on UE capability, FDD mode cells, distributed on up to 3 FDD
> carriers.
\- Depending on UE capability, 32 inter RAT GSM cells.
The requirements in section 9 on P-CCPCH RSCP measurements are applicable for
a UE performing measurements according to this section. For inter-frequency
FDD, TDD and GSM cell re-selection, measurement occasions as specified in [16]
and idle intervals as described in [14] are used to find and measure on other
cells.
It is defined below how the measurements on different systems and modes are
performed given the time allocated to that system. The requirements in this
section are based on the assumption that the time during the measurement
occasions and idle intervals that is allocated to each of the different modes
and systems shall be equally shared by the modes which the UE has capability
for and that are in the monitored set signalled by the network.
The UE is required to measure periodically once every time period T~meas~ on
each of the modes and systems, FDD interfrequency cells, TDD interfrequency
cells and GSM carriers, for which the corresponding parameter N~FDD~, N~TDD~
and N~GSM~ is set to 1, within the measurement time T~meas~
$T_{\text{meas}} = \left\lbrack \left( N_{\text{FDD}} + N_{\text{TDD}} +
N_{\text{GSM}} \right) \cdot N_{\text{TTI}} \cdot \text{M_REP} \cdot \text{10}
\right\rbrack$ms
where the following parameters are defined:
_N~TDD~_ = 0 or 1. If there are inter-frequency TDD cells in the neighbour
list _N~TDD~=_ 1, otherwise _N~TDD~=_ 0.
_N~FDD~_ = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of FDD and there are FDD cells in the
neighbour list _N~FDD~=1_ otherwise _N~FDD\ ~_ =0.
_N~GSM~_ = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of GSM and there are GSM cells in the
neighbour list, _N~GSM~=1,_ otherwise _N~GSM\ ~_ =0.
M_REP is the Measurement Occasion cycle length in number of frames as
specified in [16].
N~TTI~ is the number of frames in each measurement occasion, equal to the
length of the largest TTI on the SCCPCH monitored by the UE. FACHs that only
carry MBMS logical channels (MTCH MSCH or MCCH) are excluded from measurement
occasion calculation.
For 3.84 Mcps TDD UE capable of MBMS reception and if MBMS reception is
active, during Measurement Occasion the UE shall:
\- Start to switch back to its serving cell frequency 1 timeslot prior to the
start of the MBMS reception
\- Switch back to its target inter-frequency within 1 timeslot immediately
after the last MBMS reception.
The FACH Measurement Occasion of N~TTI~ frames will be repeated every N~TTI~ *
M_REP frame.

#### 8.4.2.2 TDD intra frequency measurements
During the CELL_FACH state the UE shall continuously measure identified intra
frequency TDD cells and search for new intra frequency TDD cells in the
monitored set. If a measurement occasion is activated, intra frequency
measurements can be performed between the measurement occasions.
In case no measurement occasion is activated, in order for the requirements in
the following subsections to apply, the Beacon timeslots of the intra-
frequency TDD cells indicated in the measurement control information shall
either be synchronised with the Beacon timeslots of the serving cell, such
that the UE can measure an intra-frequency cell TDD cell at least once every
frame for the slot allocation case in use in this cell. The UE shall be
capable of intra frequency measurements during active DL timeslots.
##### 8.4.2.2.1 Identification of a new cell
The UE shall be able to identify a new inter frequency TDD detectable cell
belonging to the monitored set within T~identify\ intra~ ms, where T~identify\
intra~ is specified in section 8.1.2.2.1.
In the case that MTCH is being received, the UE shall be able to take
identified cells into use for MTCH combining purposes within T~identify\
intra~ ms.
If more candidate cells are identified than the UE has combing capability,
then cells ranked in decreasing MTCH reception quality shall be considered for
combing purposes.

>
> T~measurement\ period\ intra~ is specified in section 8.1.2.2.2
The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting these measurements to
higher layers with the measurement period T~measurement\ period\ intra~.
If the UE has identified more than X~measurement\ intra~ intra-frequency
cells, the UE shall perform measurements of all identified cells but the

higher layers may be decreased. The measurement accuracy for all measured
cells shall be as specified in the section 9.

#### 8.4.2.5 GSM measurements
The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting TDD and GSM.
In CELL_FACH state, measurements opportunities for GSM measurements are
provided by means of measurement occasions and idle intervals.
Measurements on GSM cells can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified.
> a) In CELL_DCH state, when signaled by UTRAN and when measurement occasions
> and idle intervals are used for GSM measurements, the UE shall continuously
> measure GSM cells and search for new GSM cells given in the monitored set.
\- In section 8.4.2.1 the split of measurements between different modes and
systems is defined. Every second measurement opportunity scheduled for GSM
measurements, as given by 8.4.2.1 shall be allocated for GSM initial BSIC
identification.
\- The remaining measurement opportunities scheduled for GSM measurements
shall be scheduled as follows. 3 measurement opportunities out of 4 shall be
allocated for GSM carrier RSSI measurements and 1 out of 4 shall be allocated
for GSM BSIC reconfirmation. The scheduling of measurement opportunities
between GSM carrier RSSI measurements and GSM BSIC reconfirmation is up to the
UE.
b) In CELL_FACH state, when signaled by UTRAN and when the UE does not need
measurement occasions and idle intervals to perform GSM measurements, the UE
shall measure all GSM cells present in the monitored set
\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel is
assigned in [21] shall apply. This is further detailed in the following sub-
sections.
##### 8.4.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI
a) For a UE using measurement occasions and idle intervals to perform GSM
measurements
A UE supporting GSM measurements using measurement occasions and idle
intervals shall meet the minimum number of GSM carrier RSSI measurements
specified in table 8.7.
In CELL_FACH state the measurement period, T~measurement\ period\ GSM~, for
the GSM carrier RSSI measurement is 480 ms.
The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV in
[21], when the given measurement time allows the UE to take at least 3 GSM
carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set during the
measurement period.

* * *
In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per GSM
carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many GSM
carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3 samples
per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during that
measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement periods.
This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting period to higher
layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the measurement period.
b) For a UE not using measurement occasions and idle intervals to perform GSM
measurements
The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly
distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received signal level
measurement samples are required per GSM carrier RSSI measurement. The
measurement period shall be 480 ms.
In case UTRA RACH procedure prevents the UE from acquiring the required number
of samples per GSM carrier during one measurement period, the GSM carriers
that were not measured during that measurement period shall be measured in the
following measurement periods.
##### 8.4.2.5.2 BSIC verification
a) For a UE using measurement occasions and idle intervals to perform GSM
measurements
The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into the
following two tasks:
1) Initial BSIC identification: Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding
the BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about the relative
timing between the TDD and GSM cell. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in 8.4.2.5.2.1.
2) BSIC re-confirmation: Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after
initial BSIC identification is performed. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in 8.4.2.5.2.2.
Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall be
able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those cells where the
verification of BSIC has been successful.
The UE shall consider the BSIC of a GSM cell to be \"verified\" if it has
decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one time
(initial BSIC identification) From that time instant, the UE shall attempt to
re-confirm the BSIC at least once every 6 times T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds.
Otherwise, the UE shall consider the BSIC of the GSM cell to be \"non-
verified\".
The time requirement for initial BSIC identification, T~identify\ abort~, and
the BSIC re-confirmation interval T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the
sections below.
The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC for the purpose of initial BSIC
identification or BSIC reconfirmation within a measurement opportunity, when
the time difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation
burst at the UE and the middle of the measurement opportunity is within the
limits specified in Table 8.7.A.

* * *
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
[20].
b) For a UE not using measurement occasions and idle intervals to perform GSM
measurements
The UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC for at least the 6 strongest GSM
carriers at least every 10 seconds, to confirm that it is monitoring the same
cell, as far as UTRA RACH procedure does not prevent UE from decoding BSIC.
If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, the UE shall consider it
as \"verified\", otherwise it shall consider it as \"non-verified\".
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
[20].
###### 8.4.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification
This measurement shall be performed in the measurement opportunities as
described in 8.4.2.5.
The UE shall continuously attempt to decode the BSIC of the SCH on the BCCH
carrier of the 6 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM cells indicated in the
measurement control information. The UE shall give priority for BSIC decoding
attempts in decreasing signal strength order to BSIC carriers with unknown
BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier having the
highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value.
When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with unknown
BSIC, the UE shall use all available measurementopportunities allocated for
GSM initial BSIC identification according section 8.4.2.5 to attempt to decode
the BSIC from that GSM BCCH carrier.
If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE shall
immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH carrier, in
signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has
been successfully identified shall be moved to the BSIC re-confirmation
procedure.
If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier within
T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification attempts for
that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform BSIC
identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The GSM
BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification failed shall not be re-
considered for BSIC identification until BSIC identification attempts have
been made for all the rest of the 6 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the
monitored set with unknown BSIC.
T~identify\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1.2.5.
###### 8.4.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation
The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC re-confirmation.
The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC identification.
The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is decoded.
For each measurement opportunity allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation as
described in 8.4.2.5, the UE shall attempt to decode the BSIC occurring during
the measurement opportunity. When the UE has to select one out of several
possible GSM cells to reconfirm during the same measurement opportunity,
priority shall be given to the least recently decoded BSIC.
If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts, the UE shall
abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM cell shall
be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the GSM cell shall be
moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure, see section 8.4.2.5.2.1.
The UE shall be able to make BSIC re-confirmation attempts for the 6 strongest
GSM cells in the monitored list.
Where T~re-confirm\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1.2.5.
## 8.4A Measurements in CELL_FACH State (1.28 Mcps option)
### 8.4A.1 Introduction
This section contains requirements on the UE regarding measurement reporting
in CELL_FACH state. The requirements for cell re-selection are split in TDD
intra frequency, TDD inter frequency, FDD and GSM measurements. The
measurements are defined in TS 25.225, the measurement model is defined in TS
25.302 and measurement accuracies are specified in section 9. Control of
measurement reporting is specified in TS 25.331 and parallel measurements are
specified in section 8.2. For the description of the idle intervals see TS
25.225, Annex A.
NOTE: In CELL_FACH state, there are no requirements for measurements of inter-
RAT E-UTRAN cells.
### 8.4A.2 Requirements
#### 8.4A.2.1 UE Measurement Capability
The UE shall be able to monitor up to
\- 32 intra frequency TDD cells, and
\- 32 inter frequency cells, including
\- TDD cells distributed on up to 8 additional TDD carriers and
\- Depending on UE capability, FDD cells, distributed on up to 3 FDD carriers.
\- Depending on UE capability, 32 GSM cells distributed on up to 32 GSM
carriers.
The requirements in section 9 on P-CCPCH RSCP measurements are applicable for
a UE performing measurements according to this section. For inter-frequency
FDD, TDD and GSM cell re-selection, measurement occasions as specified in TS
25.331 and, in addition, idle intervals as described in TS 25.225 are used to
find and measure on these cells.
It is defined below how the measurements on different systems and modes are
performed given the time allocated to that system. The requirements in this
section are based on the assumption that the time during the measurement
occasions and idle intervals that is allocated to each of the different modes
and systems shall be equally shared by the modes which the UE has capability
for and that are in the monitored set signalled by the network.
The UE is required to measure periodically once every time period T~meas~ on
each of the modes and systems, FDD interfrequency cells, TDD interfrequency
cells and GSM carriers, for which the corresponding parameter N~FDD~, N~TDD~
and N~GSM~ is set to 1, within the measurement time T~meas~
$T_{\text{meas}} = \left\lbrack \left( N_{\text{FDD}} + N_{\text{TDD}} +
N_{\text{GSM}} \right) \cdot N_{\text{TTI}} \cdot \text{M_REP} \cdot \text{10}
\right\rbrack$ms
where the following parameters are defined:
_N~TDD~_ = 0 or 1. If there are inter-frequency TDD cells in the neighbour
list _N~TDD~=_ 1, otherwise _N~TDD~=_ 0.
_N~FDD~_ = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of FDD and there are FDD cells in the
neighbour list _N~FDD~=1_ otherwise _N~FDD\ ~_ =0.
_N~GSM~_ = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of GSM and there are GSM cells in the
neighbour list, _N~GSM~=1,_ otherwise _N~GSM\ ~_ =0.
M_REP is the Measurement Occasion cycle length in number of frames as
specified in TS 25.331.
N~TTI~ is the number of frames in each measurement occasion, equal to the
length of the largest TTI on the SCCPCH monitored by the UE. FACHs that only
carry MBMS logical channels (MTCH MSCH or MCCH) are excluded from measurement
occasion calculation.
The FACH Measurement Occasion of N~TTI~ frames will be repeated every N~TTI~ *

Cell FACH state.
1) For a UE requiring idle intervals or measurement occasions to perform GSM
measurements.When signalled by UTRAN during CELL_FACH state, the UE shall
continuously measure GSM cells and search for new GSM cells given in the
monitored set.
In section 8.4A.2.1 the split of measurements between different modes and
systems is defined. Every second measurement window due to idle intervals and
measurements occasions scheduled for GSM measurements, as given by 8.4A.2.1
shall be allocated for GSM initial BSIC identification.
The remaining measurement windows due to idle intervals and measurements
occasions used for GSM measurements shall be scheduled as follows. 3 window
out of 4 shall be allocated for GSM carrier RSSI measurements and 1 out of 4
shall be allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation. The scheduling of measurement
windows between GSM carrier RSSI measurements and GSM BSIC reconfirmation is
up to the UE.
2) For a UE not requiring idle intervals and measurement occasions to perform
GSM measurements:
\- the UE shall measure all GSM cells present in the monitored set
\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel is
assigned in TS 45.008 shall apply. This is further detailed in the following
sub-sections.
##### 8.4A.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI
1) For a UE requiring idle intervals or measurement occasions to perform GSM
measurements.
An UE supporting GSM measurements shall meet the minimum number of GSM carrier
RSSI measurements specified in table 8.8. This measurement shall be based on
measurement windows allocated for GSM carrier RSSI measurements as described
in 8.4A.2.5. In the CELL_FACH state the measurement period for the GSM carrier
RSSI measurement is 480 ms.
The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV in TS
45.008, when the given measurement time allows the UE to take at least 3 GSM
carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set during the
measurement period.
Table 8.8

Measurement Window Length (slots) Number of GSM carrier RSSI samples per
measurement window 3 1 4 2 5 3 7 6 15 16 30 32 60 64 120 128
* * *
In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per GSM
carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many GSM
carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3 samples
per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during that
measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement periods.
This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting period to higher
layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the measurement period.
2) For a UE not requiring idle intervals and measurement occasions to perform
GSM measurements:
The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly
distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received signal level
measurement samples are required per RSSI value. The measurement period is 480
ms.
In case UTRA RACH procedure prevents the UE from acquiring the required number
of samples per GSM carrier during one measurement period, the GSM carriers
that were not measured during that measurement period shall be measured in the
following measurement periods.
##### 8.4A.2.5.2 BSIC verification
1) For a UE requiring idle intervals or measurement occasions to perform GSM
measurements.
The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into the
following two tasks:
Initial BSIC identification\ Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding the
BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about the relative timing
between the TDD and GSM cell. The UE shall trigger the initial BSIC
identification within 50% of the available measurement windows. The
requirements for Initial BSIC identification can be found in
8.4A.2.5.2.1,Initial BSIC identification
BSIC re-confirmation\ Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after
initial BSIC identification is performed. The UE shall trigger the BSIC re-
confirmation within the available measurement windows. The requirements for
BSIC re-confirmation can be found in section 8.4A.2.5.2.2, BSIC re-
confirmation.
Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall be
able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those cells where the
verification of BSIC has been successful.
The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has decoded
the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one time (initial
BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall be re-confirmed at
least once every 6 times T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds. Otherwise the BSIC of
the GSM cell is considered as \"non-verified\". The time requirement for
initial BSIC identification, T~identify\ abort~, and the BSIC re-confirmation
interval T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the sections below.
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
TS 45.005.
2) For a UE not requiring idle intervals and measurement occasions to perform
GSM measurements:
The UE shall attempt to check the BSIC for at least the 6 strongest GSM
carriers at least every 10 seconds, to confirm that it is monitoring the same
cell, as far as UTRA RACH procedure does not prevent UE from decoding BSIC.
If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, it is considered as
\"verified\", else it is considered as \"non verified\".
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
TS 45.005.
###### 8.4A.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification
This measurement is performed in the measurement windows allocated for Initial
BSIC identification as described in 8.4A.2.5.
For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall continuously
attempt to decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the 6 strongest BCCH carriers
of the GSM cells indicated in the measurement control information. The UE
shall give priority for BSIC decoding attempts in decreasing signal strength
order to BSIC carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is
defined as the BCCH carrier having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI
value.
When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with unknown
BSIC, the UE shall use all available measurements windows allocated for GSM
initial BSIC identification according section 8.4A.2.5 to attempt to decode
the BSIC from that GSM BCCH carrier.
If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE shall
immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH carrier, in
signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has
been successfully identified shall be moved to the BSIC re-confirmation
procedure.
If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier within
T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification attempts for
that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform BSIC
identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The GSM
BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification failed shall not be re-
considered for BSIC identification until BSIC identification attempts have
been made for all the rest of the 6 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the
monitored set with unknown BSIC.
T~identify\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1A.2.5.
###### 8.4A.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation
The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC re-confirmation.
The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC identification.
The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is decoded.
For each measurement window allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation as described
in 8.4A.2.5, the UE shall attempt to decode the BSIC falling within the
effective measurement window duration. If more than one BSIC can be decoded
within the same measurement window, priority shall be given to the least
recently decoded BSIC.
If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts, the UE shall
abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM cell shall
be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the GSM cell shall be
moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure, see section 8.4A.2.5.2.1.
The UE shall be able to make BSIC re-confirmation attempts for the 6 strongest
GSM cells in the monitored list.
T~re-confirm\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1A.2.5.
It is assumed for the requirement that the measurement windows possible due to
higher layer parameters are of minimum duration necessary to perform the
measurements.

This section contains requirements on the UE regarding measurement reporting
in CELL_FACH state. The requirements are split in TDD intra frequency, TDD
inter frequency, FDD and GSM measurements. These measurements may be used by
the UTRAN, e.g. for handover decisions. The measurements are defined in [14],
the measurement model is defined in [15] and measurement accuracies are
specified in section 9. Control of measurement reporting is specified in [16]
and parallel measurements are specified in section 8.2B. For the description
of the idle intervals see [14].
### 8.4B.2 Requirements

> carriers.
\- Depending on UE capability, 32 inter RAT GSM cells.
The requirements in section 9 on P-CCPCH RSCP measurements are applicable for
a UE performing measurements according to this section. For inter-frequency
FDD, TDD and GSM cell re-selection, measurement occasions as specified in [16]
and idle intervals as described in [14] are used to find and measure on other
cells.
It is defined below how the measurements on different systems and modes are
performed given the time allocated to that system. The requirements in this
section are based on the assumption that the time during the measurement
occasions and idle intervals that is allocated to each of the different modes
and systems shall be equally shared by the modes which the UE has capability
for and that are in the monitored set signalled by the network.
The UE is required to measure periodically once every time period T~meas~ on
each of the modes and systems, FDD interfrequency cells, TDD interfrequency
cells and GSM carriers, for which the corresponding parameter N~FDD~, N~TDD~
and N~GSM~ is set to 1, within the measurement time T~meas~
$T_{\text{meas}} = \left\lbrack \left( N_{\text{FDD}} + N_{\text{TDD}} +
N_{\text{GSM}} \right) \cdot N_{\text{TTI}} \cdot \text{M_REP} \cdot \text{10}
\right\rbrack$ms
where the following parameters are defined:
_N~TDD~_ = 0 or 1. If there are inter-frequency TDD cells in the neighbour
list _N~TDD~=_ 1, otherwise _N~TDD~=_ 0.
_N~FDD~_ = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of FDD and there are FDD cells in the
neighbour list _N~FDD~=1_ otherwise _N~FDD\ ~_ =0.
_N~GSM~_ = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of GSM and there are GSM cells in the
neighbour list, _N~GSM~=1,_ otherwise _N~GSM\ ~_ =0.
M_REP is the Measurement Occasion cycle length in number of frames as
specified in [16].
N~TTI~ is the number of frames in each measurement occasion, equal to the
length of the largest TTI on the SCCPCH monitored by the UE.
For 7.68 Mcps TDD UE capable of MBMS reception and if MBMS reception is
active, during Measurement Occasion the UE shall:
\- Start to switch back to its serving cell frequency 1 timeslot prior to the
start of the MBMS reception
\- Switch back to its target inter-frequency within 1 timeslot immediately
after the last MBMS reception.
The FACH Measurement Occasion of N~TTI~ frames will be repeated every N~TTI~ *
M_REP frame.

shall measure all GSM cells present in the monitored set
\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel is
assigned in [21] shall apply. This is further detailed in the following sub-

##### 8.4B.2.5.2 BSIC verification
a) For a UE using measurement occasions and idle intervals to perform GSM
measurements
The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into the
following two tasks:
1) Initial BSIC identification: Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding
the BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about the relative
timing between the TDD and GSM cell. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in 8.4B.2.5.2.1.
2) BSIC re-confirmation: Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after
initial BSIC identification is performed. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in 8.4B.2.5.2.2.
Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC non-
verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall be
able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those cells where the
verification of BSIC has been successful.
The UE shall consider the BSIC of a GSM cell to be \"verified\" if it has
decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one time
(initial BSIC identification) From that time instant, the UE shall attempt to
re-confirm the BSIC at least once every 6 times T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds.
Otherwise, the UE shall consider the BSIC of the GSM cell to be \"non-
verified\".
The time requirement for initial BSIC identification, T~identify\ abort~, and
the BSIC re-confirmation interval T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the
sections below.
The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC for the purpose of initial BSIC
identification or BSIC reconfirmation within a measurement opportunity, when
the time difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation
burst at the UE and the middle of the measurement opportunity is within the
limits specified in Table 8.8.C.

3398 15 ± 4100 30 ± 9100 60 ± 19100 120 ± 39100
* * *
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
[20].
b) For a UE not using measurement occasions and idle intervals to perform GSM
measurements
The UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC for at least the 6 strongest GSM
carriers at least every 10 seconds, to confirm that it is monitoring the same
cell, as far as UTRA RACH procedure does not prevent UE from decoding BSIC.
If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, the UE shall consider it
as \"verified\", otherwise it shall consider it as \"non-verified\".
The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as specified in
[20].
###### 8.4B.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification
This measurement shall be performed in the measurement opportunities as
described in 8.4B.2.5.
The UE shall continuously attempt to decode the BSIC of the SCH on the BCCH
carrier of the 6 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM cells indicated in the
measurement control information. The UE shall give priority for BSIC decoding
attempts in decreasing signal strength order to BSIC carriers with unknown
BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier having the
highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value.
When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with unknown
BSIC, the UE shall use all available measurement opportunities allocated for
GSM initial BSIC identification according section 8.4B.2.5 to attempt to
decode the BSIC from that GSM BCCH carrier.
If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE shall
immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH carrier, in
signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for which the BSIC has
been successfully identified shall be moved to the BSIC re-confirmation
procedure.
If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier within
T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification attempts for
that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform BSIC
identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The GSM
BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification failed shall not be re-
considered for BSIC identification until BSIC identification attempts have
been made for all the rest of the 6 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the
monitored set with unknown BSIC.
T~identify\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1B.2.5.
###### 8.4B.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation
The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC re-confirmation.
The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC identification.
The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is decoded.
For each measurement opportunity allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation as
described in 8.4B.2.5, the UE shall attempt to decode the BSIC occurring
during the measurement opportunity. When the UE has to select one out of
several possible GSM cells to reconfirm during the same measurement
opportunity, priority shall be given to the least recently decoded BSIC.
If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts, the UE shall
abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM cell shall
be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the GSM cell shall be
moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure, see section 8.4B.2.5.2.1.
The UE shall be able to make BSIC re-confirmation attempts for the 6 strongest
GSM cells in the monitored list.
Where T~re-confirm\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1B.2.5.

various quantities which are used to trigger or perform a multitude of
functions. Both the UE and the UTRAN are required to perform a variety of
measurements. The complete list of measurements is specified in 3GPP TS 25.302
\"Services Provided by Physical Layer\". The physical layer measurements for
TDD are described and defined in 3GPP TS 25.225 \"Physical layer -
Measurements (TDD)\". In this clause for TDD, per each measurement the
relevant requirements on performance in terms of accuracy are reported.
The accuracy requirements in this clause are applicable for AWGN radio
propagation conditions.
Unless explicitly stated,
\- Reported measurements shall be within defined range in 90 % of the cases.
\- Measurement channel is 12,2 kbps as defined in 3GPP TS 25.102 annex A. This

\- All requirements are defined when UE is in a CELL_DCH or CELL_FACH stage.
The difference between modes are the reporting delay. Some of the measurements
are not requested to be reported in both stages.
\- Single task reporting.
\- Power control is active.

The reported measurement result after layer 1 filtering shall be an estimate
of the average value of the measured quantity over the measurement period. The
reference point for the measurement result after layer 1 filtering is referred
to as point B in the measurement model described in TS25.302.
The accuracy requirements in this clause are valid for the reported
measurement result after layer 1 filtering. The accuracy requirements are
verified from the measurement report at point D in the measurement model
having the layer 3 filtering disabled.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.2.1, A.5.2.2 and A.5.2.3 below. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that event-
triggered reporting with Event 1G and 2B shall be used. The CPICH_RSCP of the
best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported together with Event 2B
reporting. The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time
duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.
UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration message with activation
time \"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical Channel
reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after the UE
has reported event 2B. The starting point of T3 is defined as the end of the
last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration message.

#### A.5.3e.1.2 1.28Mcps TDD option
The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA TDD to GSM
handover delay reported in section 5.3.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3e.4, A.5.3e.5 and A.5.3e.6 below.
The test consists of two successive time periods, with a time duration of T1
and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any
timing information of cell 2.
Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the UE receives a RRC handover
command from the network. The start of T2 is the instant when the last TTI
containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the UE.
Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 is a GSM cell.
The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 2.

NOTE: The test requirement in this test case is expressed as:
T~Handover\ delay~ = 190 ms + T~offset~ + T~UL~
T~offset~: Equal to 4.65 ms, GSM timing uncertainty between the time from when
the UE is ready to transmit until the start of the next timeslot in GSM 26
multiframe structure
T~UL~: Equal to 4.65 ms, the time the UE has to wait in case the next timeslot
is an idle frame or a SACCH frame.
This gives a total of 199.3 ms, allow 200 ms in the test case.

##### A.5.4.2.1.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send
SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the CELL UPDATE message with cause
value \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.6 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE:
> The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ intra}} = T_{\text{Measurement\ Period\ \
Intra}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ms
> where:
T~Measurement\ Period\ Intra~ Specified in 8.4A.2.2.2 gives 200ms for this
test case.
T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information data
according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of system
information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280 ms is assumed
in this test case.
T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure described in
TS25.224. In this test case the persistence value is 1 thus T~RA~ is set to
35ms in the test case.
This gives a total of 1.545s, allow 1.6s in the test case.

##### A.5.4.2.3.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from when the cell quality
levels change to the moment when this change makes the UE reselect a better
ranked cell, and starts to send CHANNEL REQUEST message to perform a Location
update to the new cell.
This test is for the case where the UE camps on a 1,28 Mcps TDD cell and
reselects to a GSM cell.
The requirements and this test apply to UEs supporting both 1,28 Mcps TDD and
GSM.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 7.5 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: T~reselection\ GSM~ = 40 + T~identify\ GSM~ + T~measurement\ GSM~ \+
T~BCCH~ + T~RA~， where:
T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access procedure，10ms.
T~identify\ GSM~ Specified in TS 25.123 ,here it is 5000ms.
T~measureGSM~ 480ms according to Table 4.1A in section 4.2.
T~BCCH~ Maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell.
The maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data, when being synchronized to a
BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.
This gives a total of 7.43s, thus allow 7.5s.

##### A.5.4A.2.1.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send
SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the CELL UPDATE message with cause
value \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.6 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE:
The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ intra}} = T_{\text{Measurement\ Period\ \
Intra}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}} +
T_{\text{CSI}}$ms
where:
T~Measurement\ Period\ Intra~ Specified in 8.4A.2.2.2 gives 200ms for this
test case.
T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information data
according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of system
information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280 ms is assumed
in this test case.
T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure described in
TS25.224. In this test case the persistence value is 1 thus T~RA~ is set to
35ms in the test case.
T~CSI~ is the additional delay in case the cell re-selection indication shall
be sent in enhanced CELL_FACH state. T~CSI~ can be up to one sub frame (5ms)
or the delay caused by the random access procedure (T~RA~). In this test case
the delay is T~RA~ and is set to 35ms in the test case.
This gives a total of 1.58s, allow 1.6s in the test case.

##### A.5.4A.2.2.2 Test Requirements
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send
SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the CELL UPDATE message with cause
value \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.9 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{measurement\ inter}} +
T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}} + T_{\text{CSI}}$ms,
where:
T~measurement\ inter~ is specified in 8.4A.2.3.2 gives 480ms for this test
case.
T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information data
according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of system
information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280 ms is assumed
in this test case.
T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure described in
TS25.224. In this test case the persistence value is 1 thus T~RA~ is set to
35ms in the test case.
T~CSI~ is the additional delay in case the cell re-selection indication shall
be sent in enhanced CELL_FACH state. T~CSI~ can be up to one sub frame (5ms)
or the delay caused by the random access procedure (T~RA~). In this test case
the delay is T~RA~ and is set to 35ms in the test case.
This gives a total of 1.86s, allow 1.9s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.1.2 Test Requirements
##### A.5.5.1.2.1 for 3.84Mcps TDD option
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send the
CELL UPDATE message with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
NOTE:
The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:
T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test case,
this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1 in section
4.2.2.7.
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.
##### A.5.5.1.2.2 1.28Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
T~evaluateNTDD~ + T~SI~
where:
T~evaluateNTDD~: A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test case,
this leads to a T~evaluate\ NTDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A in section
4.2.
T~SI~: Time required for receiving all the relevant system information data
according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of system
information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280 ms is assumed
in this test case.
This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.
##### A.5.5.1.2.3 7.68Mcps TDD option
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send the
CELL UPDATE message with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
NOTE:
The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:
T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test case,
this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B in section
4.2.2.7.
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.2.2 Test Requirements
##### A.5.5.2.2.1 for 3.84Mcps TDD option
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send the
CELL UPDATE message with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
NOTE:
The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:
T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test case,
this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1 in section
4.2.2.7.
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.
##### A.5.5.2.2.2 for 1.28Mcps TDD option
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send the

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.
##### A.5.5.2.2.3 for 7.68Mcps TDD option
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send the
CELL UPDATE message with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
NOTE:
The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:
T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test case,
this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B in section
4.2.2.7.
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

#### A.5.6.1.2 Test Requirements
##### A.5.6.1.2.1 for 3.84Mcps TDD option
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send the
URA UPDATE message with URA update cause value \"change of URA \" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
NOTE:
The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:
T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test case,
this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1 in section
4.2.2.7.
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.
##### A.5.6.1.2.2 for 1.28Mcps TDD option
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send
SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the URA UPDATE message with URA
update cause value \"change of URA\" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.
NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
T~evaluateNTDD~ + T~SI~
where:
T~evaluateNTDD~: A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test case,
this leads to a T~evaluate\ NTDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A in section
4.2.
T~SI~: Time required for receiving all the relevant system information data
according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of system
information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280 ms is assumed
in this test case.
This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.
##### A.5.6.1.2.3 for 7.68Mcps TDD option
The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of time
period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to send the
URA UPDATE message with URA update cause value \"change of URA \" in cell 2.
The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.
NOTE:
The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:
T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test case,
this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B in section
4.2.2.7.
T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that needs to
be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.
This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

#### A.5.8.1.2 1.28Mcps TDD option
The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the delay when
performing the Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN TDD to GSM(GPRS)
specified in section 5.8.
The test parameters are given in Table A.5.8.1, A.5.8.2, and A.5.8.3 below.
The SS starts the UTRAN cell and brings the UE into PS-DCCH+DTCH_DCH. The SS
starts GPRS cell, then sends CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN indicating the
target cell description, GPRS cell, to the UE through DCCH of the serving
UTRAN cell.
After UE receives the command it shall configure itself accordingly and switch
to the new channel on the target GPRS cell. The SS checks whether the cell
change is performed by checking that the UE receives a successful response to
the CHANNEL REQUEST message from the SS through GPRS cell.
The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of
T1, T2 and T3 respectively. The UTRAN shall send CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN
message. The start of T3 is defined as the end of the last TTI containing the
CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN.

GSM cell before the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN is received; when UE has
synchronised to the GSM cell before the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN is
received, delay switch from UTRAN to GSM is 90ms.
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell. According
to TS 45.002, the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data, when being
synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 7.6s (in order to read System Information
type 13).

TPC commands can be made without errors.
The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow uplink
transmission at the highest bit rate (UL_TFC8 or UL_TFC9) during the entire
test and it shall be ensured that the UE is using UL_TFC8 or UL_TFC9 at the
end of T1.
The test shall be performed in the following way:
**Before time period T1:**
The allowed TFCS according to table A.x.z shall be signalled to the UE.
**During time period T1:**
The system simulator shall ensure that the UE output power is commanded to be
between 9to 10 dB below the UE Maximum allowed UL TX power.
**During time period T2:**
The system simulator shall continously send TPC_cmd=Up to the UE from the
beginning of T2 until the end of T2.
NOTE: This will emulate that UL_TFC8 to UL_TFC9 can not be supported beacuse
the UE reaches the maximum UL Tx power and still UTRAN is sending power-up
commands. The time from the beginning of T2 until the UE blocks (stops using)
UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9 shall be measured.
#### A.6A.2.2.2 Test Requirements
##### A.6A.2.2.2.1 Interactive or Background, PS, UL: 64 kbps
The UE shall have stopped using UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9 within [TBD] ms from
beginning of time period T2.
The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90%.
NOTE: The delay from the begining of T2 can be expressed as: T~ramp~ +
T~detect_block~ + T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1_proc~ + T~align_TTI~, where:
T~ramp~ Margin added for the increase of UE output power to the UE maximum
power. A margin of 7 frames (70ms) is used, i.e. 14 TPC commands.
T~detect_block~ The time needed to detect that UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9 can no
longer be supported, i.e. defines the maximum time to detect that the _Limited
TFC Set_ criterion is fulfilled for UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9. This figure is
currently TBD as X and Y in the general requirement, see section 6.4.2, are
not finalised yet.
T~notify~ Equal to [15] ms, the time allowed for MAC to indicate to higher
layers that UL_TFC8 and UL_TFC9 can no longer be supported.
T~modify~ Equal to MAX(T~adapt_max~,T~TTI~) = MAX(0, 40)=40ms
T~adapt_max~ Equals to 0ms for the case without codec.
T~L1_proc~ Equals 15ms.
T~align_TTI~ Align with the longest uplink TTI where the new TFC can be
selected. The worst case equals 40ms in this test case.
T~TTI~ See section 6.4.2. Equals 40 ms in the test case.
This gives a maximum delay of (70 + T~detect_block~ + [15] + 40 + 15 \+ 40) ms
from the beginning of T2.

T~adapt_max~ Equals to 0 ms for the case without codec.
T~TTI~ See section 6A.2. Equals 40 ms in the test case.
T~L1_proc~ Equals 35 ms.
T~align_TTI~ Align with the longest uplink TTI where the new TFC can be
selected. The worst case equals 40ms in this test case.

network.
###### A.7.4.2.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the uplink
synchronization control during intra-frequency handover in CELL_DCH state as
reported in section 7.5.2.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.4.4 and A.7.4.5 below. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2 and
T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any
timing information of cell 2.
UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" at the beginning of T3 with a new active cell, cell 2, after the UE
has reported event 1G. The starting point of T3 is defined as the end of the
last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration message.
UTRAN measures the initial uplink synchronization timing position of the first
uplink DPCH on the target cell and compares it with the desired position. If
the difference dose not exceed the accuracy requirements in section 7.5.2.2,
it is recorded as success once.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at least
90% with a confidence level of 95%.
##### A.7.4.2.2.2 Scenario 2: Handover to inter-frequency cell
This test case is applicable for UE handovers in single frequency network and
UE handovers from primary frequency to secondary frequency in multi-frequency
network.
###### A.7.4.2.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment
The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the uplink
synchronization control during intra-frequency handover in CELL_DCH state as
reported in section 7.5.2.2.
The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.4.7 and A.7.4.8 as below. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2 and
T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any
timing information of cell 2.
UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" at the beginning of T3 with a new active cell, cell 2, after the UE
has reported event 1G. The starting point of T3 is defined as the end of the
last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration message.
UTRAN measures the initial uplink synchronization timing position of the first
uplink DPCH on the target cell and compare it with the desired position. If
the difference dose not exceed the accuracy requirements in section 7.5.2.2,
it is recorded as success once.
