# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for UTRA Base Stations (BS) operating in the TDD
mode. These have been derived from, and are consistent with, the UTRA base
station (BS) specifications defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 [1]. The document covers
all three options of the TDD mode, which are the 3,84 Mcps (incorporating
MBSFN IMB), the 1,28 Mcps and the 7.68 Mcps options respectively. The
requirements are listed in different subsections only if the parameters
deviate.
In this TS, the reference point for RF connections (except for the measurement
of mean transmitted RF carrier power) is the antenna connector, as defined by
the manufacturer. This TS does not apply to repeaters or RF devices which may
be connected to an antenna connector of a BS.

# 3 Definitions, symbols, and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
**Ancillary RF amplifier:** a piece of equipment, which when connected by RF
coaxial cables to the BS, has the primary function to provide amplification
between the transmit and/or receive antenna connector of a BS and an antenna
without requiring any control signal to fulfil its amplifying function.
**BS RF bandwidth** : The bandwidth in which a Base Station **simultaneously**
transmits and/or **simultaneously** receives multiple carriers within each
supported operating band.
**BS RF bandwidth edge:** The frequency of one of the edges of the Base
Station RF bandwidth
**Bit Error Ratio:** The Bit Error Ratio is defined as the ratio of the bits
wrongly received to all data bits sent. The bits are the data bits above the
convolutional/turbo decoder. The BER is the overall BER independent of frame
erasures or when erased frames are not defined.
**Block Error Ratio:** A Block Error Ratio is defined as the ratio of the
number of erroneous blocks received to the total number of blocks sent. An
erroneous block is a Transport Block whose cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is
wrong.
**Power Spectral Density: The units of Power Spectral Density (PSD) are
extensively used in this document. PSD is a function of power versus frequency
and when integrated across a given bandwidth, the function represents the mean
power in such a bandwidth. When the mean power is normalised to (divided by)
the chip-rate it represents the mean energy per chip. Some signals are
directly defined in terms of energy per chip, (DPCH_Ec, Ec, and P-CCPCH_Ec)
and others defined in terms of PSD (Io, Ioc, Ior and Îor). There also exist
quantities that are a ratio of energy per chip to PSD (DPCH_Ec/Ior, Ec/Ior
etc.). This is the common practice of relating energy magnitudes in
communication systems.**
**It can be seen that if both energy magnitudes in the ratio are divided by
time, the ratio is converted from an energy ratio to a power ratio, which is
more useful from a measurement point of view. It follows that an energy per
chip of X dBm/3,84 MHz can be expressed as a mean power per chip of X dBm.
Similarly, a signal PSD of Y dBm/3,84 MHz can be expressed as a signal power
of Y dBm.**
**Mean power:** When applied to a CDMA modulated signal this is the power
(transmitted or received) in a bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip
rate of the radio access mode. The period of measurement shall be a transmit
timeslot excluding the guard period unless otherwise stated.
NOTE: The roll-off factor α is defined in section 6.8.1.
**RRC filtered mean power:** The mean power as measured through a root raised
cosine filter with roll-off factor α and a bandwidth equal to the chip rate of
the radio access mode.
NOTE: The RRC filtered mean power of a perfectly modulated CDMA signal is
0.246 dB lower than the mean power of the same signal.
**Code domain power:** That part of the mean power which correlates with a
particular (OVSF) code channel. The sum of all powers in the code domain
equals the mean power in a bandwidth of (1+ α) times the chip rate of the
radio access mode.
**Highest Carrier:** The carrier with the highest carrier centre frequency
transmitted/received in a specified operating band**.**
**Inter RF bandwidth gap:** The frequency gap between two consecutive RF
bandwidths that are placed within two supported operating bands respectively.
**Multi-band Base Station:** Base Station characterized by the ability of its
transmitter and/or receiver to process two or more carriers in common active
RF components simultaneously, where at least one carrier is configured at a
different non-overlapping operating band than the other carrier(s).
**Multi-band transmitter:** Transmitter characterized by the ability to
process two or more carriers in common active RF components simultaneously,
where at least one carrier is configured at a different non-overlapping
operating band than the other carrier(s).
**Multi-band receiver:** Receiver characterized by the ability to process two
or more carriers in common active RF components simultaneously, where at least
one carrier is configured at a different non-overlapping operating band than
the other carrier(s).
**Maximum radio bandwidth:** **Maximum frequency difference between the upper
edge of the highest used carrier and the lower edge of the lowest used
carrier.**
**Maximum BS RF bandwidth:** The maximum RF bandwidth supported by a BS within
each supported operating band.
**Output power, Pout:** The mean power of one carrier of the base station,
delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the
transmitter.
**Lower RF bandwidth edge:** The frequency of the lower of the Base station RF
bandwidth, used as a frequency reference point for transmitter and receiver
requirements.
**Lowest Carrier:** The carrier with the lowest carrier centre frequency
transmitted/received in a specified operating band.
**Maximum output power, Pmax:** The mean power level per carrier of the base
station measured at the antenna connector in a specified reference condition.
The period of measurement shall be a transmit timeslot excluding the guard
period.
**MBSFN-only operation:** Operation of a dedicated carrier solely for the
purposes of MBSFN transmission. _No receive functionality is implemented on
the specified carrier frequency._
**Rated output power, PRAT:** Rated output power of the base station is the
mean power level per carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be
available at the antenna connector.
**Rated total output power:** Rated total output power of the base station is
the mean power level that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the
antenna connector.
**Synchronized operation:** Operation of TDD in two different systems, where
no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur.
**Total power dynamic range:** The difference between the maximum and the
minimum output power of the base station for a specified reference condition.
**Total RF bandwidth** : Maximum sum of RF bandwidths in all supported
operating bands.
**Upper RF bandwidth edge:** The frequency of the upper edge of the Base
Station RF Bandwidth; used as a frequency reference point for transmitter and
receiver requirements.
**Unsynchronized operation:** Operation of TDD in two different systems, where
the conditions for synchronized operation are not met.

# 4 Frequency bands and channel arrangement
## 4.1 General
The information presented in this section is based on a chip rate of 3,84
Mcps, 1,28 Mcps respectively and 7.68 Mcps .
NOTE: Other chip rates may be considered in future releases.
## 4.2 Frequency bands
UTRA/TDD is designed to operate in the following bands:
a) 1900 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
2010 - 2025 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission
b) 1850 - 1910 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
1930 - 1990 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
c) 1910 - 1930 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
d) 2570 - 2620 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission
e) 2300 - 2400 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission
f) 1880 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
Note 1: Deployment in existing and other frequency bands is not precluded.
Note 2: In China, Band a only includes 2010 - 2025 MHz for 1.28 Mcps TDD
option.
## 4.3 TX-RX frequency separation
### 4.3.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option
No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD) is
employed. Each TDMA frame consists of 15 timeslots where each timeslot can be
allocated to either transmit or receive.
### 4.3.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option
No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD) is
employed. Each subframe consists of 7 main timeslots where all main timeslots
(at least the first one) before the single switching point are allocated UL
and all main timeslots (at least the last one) after the single switching
point are allocated DL.
### 4.3.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option
No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD) is
employed. Each TDMA frame consists of 15 timeslots where each timeslot can be
allocated to either transmit or receive.
## 4.4 Channel arrangement
### 4.4.1 Channel spacing
#### 4.4.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
#### 4.4.1.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option
The nominal channel spacing is 1,6 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
#### 4.4.1.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option
The nominal channel spacing is 10 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 4.4.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the carrier
frequency must be a multiple of 200 kHz.
#### 4.4.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD Option
In addition a number of additional centre frequencies are specified according
to table 5.1, which means that the centre frequencies for these channels are
shifted 100 kHz relative to the general raster.
### 4.4.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA absolute radio frequency
channel number (UARFCN). The value of the UARFCN in the IMT2000 band is
defined in the general case as follows:
N~t~ = 5 ∗ F MHz 0,0 ≤ F ≤ 3276,6 MHz
where F is the carrier frequency in MHz.
Additional channels applicable to operation in the frequency band defined in
sub-clause 5.2(d) for 3,84 Mcps are defined via the following UARFCN
definition:
N~t~ = 5 * (F - 2150.1 MHz) 2572.5 MHz ≤ F≤ 2617.5 MHz
The 10 additional UARFCN for operations in frequency band defined in sub-
clause 5.2(d) for 3,84 Mcps are hence: 2112, 2137, 2162, 2187, 2212, 2237,
2262, 2287, 2312, 2337.
# 5 General test conditions and declarations
Many of the tests in this TS measure a parameter relative to a value that is
not fully specified in the UTRA specifications. For these tests, the Minimum
Requirement is determined relative to a nominal value specified by the
manufacturer.
Certain functions of a BS are optional in the UTRA specifications. Some
requirements for the BS may be regional as listed in subclause 5.17.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported.
## 5.1 Base station classes
### 5.1.1 Applicability of requirements and BS class definition
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area base stations, Local
Area base stations and Home Base Stations in co-ordinated network operation,
unless otherwise stated.
Wide Area BS are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell and
Micro Cell scenarios with BS to UE coupling losses equal to 70 dB and 53 dB.
The Wide Area Base Station has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 99 for 3,84 Mcps option, and in release
4 for both 3,84 Mcps and 1,28 Mcps option.
Local Area BS are characterised by requirements derived from Pico Cell
scenarios with a BS to UE coupling loss equals to 45 dB.
Home Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Femto Cell
scenarios.
### 5.1.2 Manufacturer's declaration of supported RF configurations
The manufacturer shall declare which operational configurations the BS

\- The reduced number of supported carriers at the rated total output power;
\- The reduced total output power at the maximum number of supported carriers.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the parameters above shall be declared
for each supported operating band in single-band operation. In addition the
manufacturer shall declare the following additional parameters for BS capable
of multi-band operation:
\- Supported operating band combinations of the BS
\- Supported operating band(s) of each antenna connector
\- Support of multi-band transmitter and/or multi-band receiver, including
mapping to antenna connector(s)
\- Total number of supported carriers for the declared band combinations of
the BS

The manufacturer shall declare:
\- which of the frequency bands defined in sub-clause 4.2 are supported by the
BS.
\- the frequency range within the above frequency band(s) supported by the BS.
As TDD is employed, the same frequency range is used for transmit and receive
operation. For the case of MBSFN-only operation, the frequency range is used
for transmit only, since no receive requirement exists.
For the single carrier testing, many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top of the operating
frequency band of the BS. These are denoted as RF channels B (bottom), M
(middle) and T (top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single carrier at
each of the RF channels B, M and T.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the UARFCNs to be used for RF
channels B, M and T shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may
consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.
When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the UARFCNs to be used for RF
channels B, M and T may be specified by an operator.
### 5.3.1 RF bandwidth position for multi-carrier testing
Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum RF bandwidth located at
the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range in each operating
band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~(bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~
(top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and
T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~: maximum RF bandwidth located at the bottom of the supported
frequency range in each operating band;
\- M~RFBW~: maximum RF bandwidth located in the middle of the supported
frequency range in each operating band;
\- T~RFBW~: maximum RF bandwidth located at the top of the supported frequency
range in each operating band.
For BS capable of dual-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the test shall
be performed at B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ defined as following:
B~RFBW~_ T\'~RFBW~: the RF bandwidths located at the bottom of the supported
frequency range in the lower operating band and at the highest possible
simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum radio bandwidth, in the
upper operating band.
B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW:~ the RF bandwidths located at the top of the supported
frequency range in the upper operating band and at the lowest possible
simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum radio bandwidth, in the
lower operating band.
NOTE: B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ = B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ when the declared
maximum radio bandwidth spans both operating bands. B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ means the
RF bandwidths are located at the bottom of the supported frequency range in
the lower operating band and at the top of the supported frequency range in
the upper operating band.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in each supported operating band, as well as the position
of B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating band
combinations, shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may consult
with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

operational conditions are not tested in this TS. These may be stated and
tested separately.
#### 5.9.2.1 Extreme temperature
When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum operating temperatures
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
**Minimum temperature:**
\- The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods of inducing the required environmental phenomena into the equipment,
conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068‑2‑1 [4], Environmental Testing,
Part 2: Tests ‑ Tests A: Cold. The equipment shall be maintained at the
stabilized condition for the duration of the test sequence.
**Maximum temperature:**
\- The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods of inducing the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment,
conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068‑2‑2 [5] (Environmental Testing,
Part 2: Tests ‑ Tests Bd Dry heat). The equipment shall be maintained at the
stabilized condition for the duration of the test sequence.
NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational prior to
the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.
### 5.9.3 Vibration
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturers declaration for the equipment under test. This shall use
the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing the required
environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to the test procedure
of IEC 60 068‑2‑6 [8], Environmental Testing, Part 2: Tests ‑ Test Fc and
guidance: Vibration (Sinusoidal). Other environmental conditions shall be
within the ranges specified in subclause 5.9.1, Normal test environment.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to
equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should only
vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.
### 5.9.4 Power supply
When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test shall
be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating voltage
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
**Upper voltage limit**
\- The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at a steady state minimum and
maximum limit declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to the methods
described in IEC 60 068‑2‑1 [4] Test Ab/Ad: Cold and IEC 60 068‑2‑2 [5] Test
Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.
**Lower voltage limit**
\- The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at a steady state minimum and
maximum limit declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to the methods
described in IEC 60 068‑2‑1 [4] Test Ab/Ad: Cold and IEC 60 068‑2‑2 [5] Test
Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.
### 5.10 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the stimulus
signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance and
the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the
specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values and are
valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 5.10 apply
to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include
system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.
### 5.10.1 Measurement of test environments
The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments defined in subclause 5.9
shall be:
> Pressure: ± 5 kPa
>
> Temperature: ± 2 degrees
>
> Relative Humidity: ± 5 %
>
> DC Voltage: ± 1,0 %
>
> AC Voltage: ± 1,5 %
>
> Vibration: 10 %
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

### 5.11 Test Tolerances (informative)
The Test Tolerances defined in this subclause have been used to relax the
Minimum Requirements in this specification to derive the Test Requirements.
The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test
Tolerance may sometimes be set to zero.
The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason, e. g. to take
account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss,
etc.)

## 5.12 Interpretation of measurement results
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [13].
The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the measurement of
each parameter shall be included in the test report.
The recorded value for theTest System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in subclause 5.10
of this TS.
If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in subclause 5.10, it is still permitted to use
this equipment provided that an adjustment is made as follows:
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
subclause 5.10 shall be used to tighten the Test Requirement - making the test
harder to pass. (For some tests, e. g. receiver tests, this may require
modification of stimulus signals).
This procedure (defined in Annex D) will ensure that a Test System not
compliant with subclause 5.10 does not increase the chance of passing a device
under test where that device would otherwise have failed the test if a Test
System compliant with subclause 5.10 had been used.
## 5.13 Selection of configurations for testing
Measurements shall be performed within the time slots under test as specified
individually for each test within the subclause \"Initial conditions\".
Most tests in this TS are only performed for a subset of the possible
combinations of test conditions. For instance:
‑ Not all TRXs in the configuration may be specified to be tested.
‑ Only one RF channel may be specified to be tested.
‑ Only one timeslot may be specified to be tested.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.
When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the choice of which combinations
are to be tested may be specified by an operator.
## 5.14 BS Configurations
This TS has been written to specify tests for the standard configurations of
BS which have been assumed in UTRA requirements specifications, in particular
TS 25.105 [1]. However, there are other configurations of BS which comply with
these specifications, but for which the application of these specifications is
not fully defined. For some such configurations there may be alternate ways to
apply the requirements of this specification to testing of the configuration,
or some variation in the test method may be necessary. It may therefore be
necessary for the parties to the testing to reach agreement over the method of
testing in advance.
If the BS is supplied in a number of different environmental enclosures or
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
environmental configuration, provided that it can be demonstrated that the
equipment has been tested at the worst internal environmental conditions.
Where alternative interpretations of this specification are possible for a BS
configuration under test, the interpretation which has been adopted in
performing the test shall be recorded with the test results.
Where variation in the test method within this TS has been necessary to enable
a BS configuration to be tested, the variation in the test method which has
been made in performing the test shall be recorded with the test results.
Where possible, agreement should be reached in advance about the nature of
such a variation with any party who will later receive the test results.
Possible interpretations of this TS for some common configurations are given
in the following subclauses.
### 5.14.1 Receiver diversity
For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement applies at
each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna diversity.
Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the remaining
receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the
manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be equivalent, it is
sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any one of the receiver
antenna connectors.
For a multi-band BS, multi-band tests for blocking and intermodulation are
performed with the interferer(s) applied to each antenna connector mapped to
the receiver for the wanted signal(s), however only to one antenna at a time.
Antenna connectors to which no signals are applied are terminated.
### 5.14.2 Duplexers
Due to TDD operation, there is no need to use a duplexer in the BS.
### 5.14.3 Power supply options
If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply configurations,
it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the power supply
options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of conditions
over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the range of
conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be supplied
either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In this case, the
conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power supply options can be
tested by testing only the external DC supply option. The range of DC input
voltages for the test should be sufficient to verify the performance with any
of the power supplies, over its range of operating conditions within the BS,
including variation of mains input voltage, temperature and output current.
### 5.14.4 Ancillary RF amplifiers
The requirements of this TS shall be met with the ancillary RF amplifier
fitted. At tests according to clause 6 and 7 for TX and RX respectively, the
ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting network (including
any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to make sure the
appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary amplifier and the BS. The
applicable connecting network loss range is declared by the manufacturer.
Other characteristics and the temperature dependence of the attenuation of the
connecting network are neglected. The actual attenuation value of the
connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the applicable extreme
values. The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.
Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted and,
if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of this TS in both cases.
### 5.14.5 BS using antenna arrays
A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some or all
of its TRXs or with an antenna array related to one cell (not one array per
TRX). This subclause applies to a BS which meets at least one of the following
conditions:
\- The transmitter output signals from one or more TRX appear at more than one
antenna port, or
\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a TRX or per cell and an
input signal is required at more than one port for the correct operation of
the receiver (NOTE: diversity reception does not meet this requirement) thus
the outputs from the transmitters as well as the inputs to the receivers are
directly connected to several antennas (known as \"aircombining\"), or
If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with an antenna system
which contains filters or active elements which are necessary to meet the UTRA
requirements, the tests of conformance may be performed on a system comprising
the BS together with these elements, supplied separately for the purposes of
testing. In this case, it must be demonstrated that the performance of the
configuration under test is representative of the system in normal operation,
and the conformance assessment is only applicable when the BS is used with the
antenna system.
For testing of conformance of such a BS, the following procedure may be used:
#### 5.14.5.1 Receiver tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna connectors
shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals the
power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.
An example of a suitable test set up is shown in figure 5.1.
{width="5.6875in" height="1.65625in"}
Figure 5.1: Receiver test set up
For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may be
performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.
#### 5.14.5.2 Transmitter tests
For each test, the conformance requirement shall be met by the sum of the
signals emitted by each transmitter antenna connector. This may be assessed by
separately measuring the signals emitted by each antenna connector and summing
the results, or by combining the signals and performing a single measurement.
The characteristics (e.g. amplitude and phase) of the combining network should
be such that the power of the combined signal is maximised.
An example of a suitable test set up is shown in figure 5.2.
{width="3.34375in" height="1.65625in"}
Figure 5.2: Transmitter test set up
For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately for each
transmitter antenna connector.
### 5.14.6 MIMO transmission
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present document,
the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector in the case of
MIMO transmission.
Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to measure
the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors.
## 5.15 Overview of the conformance test requirements
Tables 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11 give an overview of the conformance test
requirements for the transmitter, the receiver and system performance,
respectively. Requirements related to receive functionality for the BS under

## 5.20 Test configurations for multi-carrier operation
The test configurations shall be constructed using the methods defined below,
subject to the parameters declared by the manufacturer for the supported RF
configurations as listed in subclause 5.1.2. The applicable test
configurations to be use for conformance testing are defined for each
supported RF configuration in clause 5.21.
Note: The test configurations in this subclause are intended for UTRA TDD
1.28Mcps option.
### 5.20.1 UTTC1: Multi-carrier operation test configuration
The purpose of the UTTC1 is to test both BS transmitter and receiver
requirements.
#### 5.20.1.1 UTTC1 generation
UTTC1 should be constructed using the following method:
\- The RF bandwidth shall be the declared maximum supported RF bandwidth.
\- Place two UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps option carriers adjacent to the high and low
edge of the RF bandwidth.
\- For transmitter tests, alternately place a UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps option carrier
adjacent to the already placed carriers at the low and high edge of the RF
bandwidth until there is no more space to fit a carrier or the BS does not
support more carriers. The nominal carrier spacing defined in clause 4.4.1
shall apply.
#### 5.20.1.1 UTTC1 power allocation
Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the rated total output power according to the manufacturer's
declaration in sub clause 5.1.2.
### 5.20.2 UTTC2: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation
The purpose of the UTTC2 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
maximum supported number of carriers.
#### 5.20.2.1 UTTC2 generation
UTTC2 is based on re-using the exsiting test configuration applicable per band
involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the following
method:
● The RF bandwidth of each supported operating band in multi-band operation
shall be the declared maximum RF bandwidth of each supported operating band in
multi-band operation.
● The number of carriers of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum number of supported carrier of each supported operating band
in multi-band operation. Carriers shall first be placed at the outermost edges
of the declared maximum radio bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be
placed at the edges of the RF bandwidths, if possible.
● The allocated RF bandwidth of the outermost bands shall be located at the
outermost edges of the declared maximum radio bandwidth.
● Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and the
corresponding UTTC1shall be generated in each band. The mirror image of the
single-band test configuration shall be used in the highest band being tested
for the BS to ensure a narrowband carrier being placed at both edges of the BS
maximum radio bandwidth.
● If a multi-band BS supports only 3 carriers, two carriers shall be placed in
one band according to UTTC1while the remaining carrier shall be placed at the
edge of the maximum radio bandwidth in the other band.
● If the sum of the maximum RF bandwidth of each supported operating bands is
larger than the declared total RF bandwidth of transmitter and receiver for
the declared band combinations of the BS, repeat the steps above for test
configurations where the RF bandwidth of one of the operating band shall be
reduced so that the total RF bandwidth of transmitter and receiver is not
exceeded and vice versa.
● If the sum of the maximum number of supported carrier of each supported
operating bands in multi-band operation is larger than the declared total
number of supported carriers for the declared band combinations of the BS,
repeat the steps above for test configurations where in each test
configuration the number of carriers of one of the operating band shall be
reduced so that the total number of supported carriers is not be exceeded and
vice versa.
#### 5.20.2.2 UTTC2 power allocation
Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same power so that the sum of the carrier powers equals
the total output power according to the manufacturer's declaration.
If the allocated power of a supported operating band(s) exceeds the declared
rated total output power of the operating band(s) in multi-band operation, the
exceeded part shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other band(s). If
the power allocated for a carrier exceeds the rated output power declared for
that carrier, the exceeded power shall, if possible, be reallocated into the
other carriers.
## 5.21 Applicability of test configurations
The present clause defines for each RF test requirement the set of mandatory
test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating conformance. The
applicable test configurations are specified in the tables below for each
supported RF configuration, which shall be declared according to subclause
5.1.2. The generation and power allocation for each test configuration is
defined in clause 5.20.
For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, a single
carrier (SC) shall be used for testing.
For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation in contiguous
spectrum operation only, the test configurations in Table 5.14 shall be used
for testing.
Note: The applicability of test configurations in this subclause is only
applicable to UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps option.

## 5.22 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For some
requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or exclusions to
the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band operation. In the case
where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the following
applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, operating band unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to each antenna connector.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to the antenna connector configured for single-band operation and
no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-
band requirements are tested separately at the antenna connector configured
for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in the present
specification assume synchronized operation, **where no simultaneous uplink
and downlink occur** between the supported operating bands.
# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of multi-carrier transmission
with multiple transmitter antenna connectors or MIMO transmission, the
requirements apply for each transmitter antenna connector.
A BS supporting MC-HSDPA transmits multiple carriers simultaneously on
adjacent carrier frequencies.
Unless otherwise stated, all measurements shall be made at the BS antenna
connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus such
as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used, the
tests according to subclauses 5.14.4 shall be performed to ensure that the
requirements are met at test port B.

the code domain power of a power controlled CCTrCH in response to each valid
power control bit received from the UE on the Uplink Traffic Channel based on
the mapping of the TPC bits in uplink CCTrCH to downlink CCTrCH. Inner loop
control is based on SIR measurements at the UE receiver, and the corresponding
TPC commands are generated by the UE.
### 6.4.2 Power control steps

that is sufficiently high to generate a SIR at the UE receiver equal to the
target SIR, while limiting the intercell interference.

For 1,28 Mcps TDD option, the mandatory spurious emission requirement applies
from 9kHz to 12.75GHz, excluding the frequency ranges from 4 MHz below the
lowest frequency of each supported operating band to4 MHz above the highest
frequency of each operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where
multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector, this exclusion
applies for each supported operating bands. For BS capable of multi-band
operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the
sinlge-band requirements apply and the multi-band exclusions and provisions
are not applicable.
For 7.68 Mcps TDD option, either requirement (except 6.6.3.2.6) applies at
frequencies within the specified frequency ranges which are more than 25 MHz
under the first carrier frequency used or more than 25 MHz above the last
carrier frequency used.

## 6.7 Transmit intermodulation
### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability
The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements
caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna.
The transmit intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when a CDMA modulated interference signal is injected into the
antenna connector at a power level of 30 dB lower than that of the rated total
output power in the operating band.
#### 6.7.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option
The carrier frequency of the interference signal shall be ±5 MHz, ±10 MHz and
±15 MHz offset from the subject signal carrier frequency, but excluding
interference carrier frequencies outside of the UTRA frequency bands specified
in 4.2a, 4.2b or 4.2c, respectively.
#### 6.7.1.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option
The interfering signal offset from the subject signal shall be as defined in
table 6.37F.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply regardless of
the interfering signals position relative to the inter RF bandwidth gap.
Table 6.37F: Interfering signal frequency offset
+----------------------------------------------------------+----------+ | Parameter | Value | +----------------------------------------------------------+----------+ | Interfering signal frequency offset from the subject | ±1,6 MHz | | signal carrier frequency | | | | ±3,2 MHz | | | | | | ±4,8 MHz | +----------------------------------------------------------+----------+ | Interfering signal frequency offset from the edge of RF | ±0.8MHz | | bandwidth | | | | ±2.4 MHz | | | | | | ±4.0 MHz | +----------------------------------------------------------+----------+ | NOTE 1: Interference frequencies that are outside of the | | | allocated frequency band are excluded from the | | | requirement, unless the interfering signal positions | | | fall within the frequency range of adjacent downlink | | | operating bands in the same geographical area. | | +----------------------------------------------------------+----------+
#### 6.7.1.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option
The carrier frequency of the interference signal shall be ±10 MHz, ±20 MHz and
±30 MHz offset from the subject signal carrier frequency, but excluding
interference carrier frequencies outside of the UTRA frequency bands specified
in 4.2a, 4.2b or 4.2c, respectively.
### 6.7.2 Minimum Requirements
The transmit intermodulation level shall not exceed the out of band or the
spurious emission requirements of subclause 6.6.2 and 6.6.3, respectively.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 [1] subclause 6.7.1.
### 6.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in its non linear elements caused
by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna to below specified levels.

#### 6.7.4.2 Procedure
1) Apply the single-band test procedures for out of band and spurious
emissions as described in 6.6.2 and 6.6.3, respectively, at the frequencies of
all third and fifth order intermodulation products. The frequency band
occupied by the interference signal are excluded from the measurements.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following steps shall apply:
2) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band with no carrier activated in the other band.
3) For multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connector, the antenna
connector not being under test shall be terminated.
NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are at frequencies (F1 ± 2F2)
and (2F1 ± F2), the fifth order intermodulation products are at frequencies
(2F1 ± 3F2), (3F1 ± 2F2), (4F1 ± F2) and (F1 ± 4F2), where F1 represents the
frequencies within the bandwidth of the wanted signal and F2 represents the
frequencies within the bandwidth of the CDMA modulated interference signal.
### 6.7.5 Test Requirements
NOTE: If the Test Requirement below differs from the Minimum Requirement, then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex D.
The power level of the CDMA modulated interference signal shall be 30 dB below
the rated total output power in the operating band.
At the frequencies of all third and fifth order intermodulation products, the
Test Requirements for out of band and spurious emissions as specified in
subclauses 6.6.2.1.5 (Spectrum emission mask), 6.6.2.2.5 (ACLR) and 6.6.3.5
(Spurious emissions) shall be met.
The requirement is always applicable outside the Base Station RF bandwidth or
maximum radio bandwidth.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies relative to
the RF bandwidth edges in each supported operating band. In case the inter RF
bandwidth gap is less than 4.8 MHz, the requirement in the gap applies only
for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the inter RF bandwidth gap.
## 6.8 Transmit Modulation
### 6.8.1 Modulation accuracy
#### 6.8.1.1 Definition and applicability
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Both waveforms pass through a matched Root Raised Cosine filter
with bandwidth corresponding to the considered chip rate and roll-off α =0,22.
Both waveforms are then further modified by selecting the frequency, absolute
phase, absolute amplitude and chip clock timing so as to minimise the error
vector. The EVM result is defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean
error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %. The
measurement interval is one timeslot. [ ]{.underline} The requirement is valid
over the total power dynamic range as specified in section 3.1. See Annex C of
this specification for further details.
NOTE: The theoretical modulated waveform shall be calculated on the basis that
the transmit pulse shaping filter is a root-raised cosine (RRC) with roll-off
α =0,22 in the frequency domain. The impulse response of the chip impulse
filter _RC_ ~0~(_t_) is
{width="2.926388888888889in" height="0.9222222222222223in"}
Where the roll-off factor α = 0,22 and _T~C~_ is the chip duration
#### 6.8.1.2 Minimum Requirements
The error vector magnitude (EVM) shall not exceed 12,5 %. The requirement is
valid over the total power dynamic range as specified in section 3.1.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 [1] subclause
6.8.2.1.
#### 6.8.1.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to generate a
sufficient precise waveform and thus to enable the UE receiver to achieve the
specified error performance.

##### 7.5.2.2.1 General requirements
The static reference performance as specified in clause 7.2 shall be met with
a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the BS antenna input using the
parameters specified in tables 7.6A-1, 7.7A-1,7.8A-1, 7.9A-1, 7.6A-2, 7.7A-2,
7.8A-2 or 7.9A-2, respectively.
The blocking requirement is always applicable outside the Base Station RF
bandwidth or maximum radio bandwidth edges. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the lower (upper) or maximum radio bandwidth edges.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency range applies for each supported operating band. The
requirements applies in addition inside any inter RF bandwidth gap as long as
the inter RF bandwidth gap size is at least 4.8MHz. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the lower/upper RF bandwidth edges inside the
inter RF bandwidth gap and is equal to -2.4MHz/+2.4MHz, respectively.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each supported operating band, with the
exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported
operating bands shall be excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

carrier activated in the other band.
(5) The interfering signal shall first be applied on the same port as the
wanted signal. The test shall be repeated with the interfering signal applied
on the other port (if any) mapped to the same receiver as the wanted signal.
Any antenna connector with no signal applied in case of single-band or multi-
band test shall be terminated.
(6) Repeat step (5) with the wanted signal for the other band(s) applied on
the respective port(s).

(1) Set the signal generator to produce an interfering signal at a frequency
offset Fuw from the assigned channel frequency of the wanted signal which is
given by
Fuw = ± (n x 1 MHz),
where n shall be increased in integer steps from n = 20 up to such a value
that the center frequency of the interfering signal covers the range from 1
MHz to 12,75 GHz. The interfering signal level measured at the antenna
connector shall be set in dependency of its center frequency, as specified in
tables 7.6B to 7.10F. The type of the interfering signal is either equivalent
to a continuous wideband CDMA signal with one code of chip frequency 7,68
Mchip/s, filtered by an RRC transmit pulse-shaping filter with roll-off α =
0,22, or a CW signal; see subclause tables 7.6B to 7.10F.

(3) Interchange the connections of the BS Rx ports and repeat the measurements
according to steps (1) and (2).
### 7.5.5 Test Requirements
NOTE 1: If the Test Requirement below differs from the Minimum Requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the explanation of how the
Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex
D.
In all measurements made according to subclause 7.5.4.2, the BER shall not
exceed 0,001.
NOTE 2: Annex F describes the procedure for BER tests taking into account the
statistical consequence of frequent repetition of BER measurements within the
blocking test . The consequence is: a DUT exactly on the limit may fail due to
the statistical nature 2.55 times(mean value) in 12750 BER measurements using
the predefined wrong decision probability of 0.02%. If the fail cases are ≤12,
it is allowed to repeat the fail cases 1 time before the final verdict.
## 7.6 Intermodulation characteristics
### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two or more
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal.

The blocking requirement is always applicable outside the Base Station RF
bandwidth or maximum radio bandwidth edges. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the lower (upper) or maximum radio bandwidth edges.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any inter RF bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at least 11.2MHz.
The CW interfering signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper RF
bandwidth edges inside the inter RF bandwidth gap and is equal to
-2.4MHz/+2.4MHz, respectively. The modulated interfering signal offset is
defined relative to lower/upper RF bandwidth edges inside the inter RF
bandwidth gap and is equal to -5.6MHz/+5.6MHz, respectively.

###### ## Annex C (normative): Global in-channel Tx test
# C.1 General
The global in-channel Tx test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of the Tx
under test in a single measurement process.
The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter, however,
are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for description inside
this annex places particular emphasis on the exclusion of all
interdependencies among the parameters. Any other algorithm (e.g. having
better computational efficiency) may be applied, as long as the results are
the same within the accuracy limits.
All notes referred to in the various subclauses of C.2 are put together in
clause C.3
# C.2 Definition of the process
## C.2.1 Basic principle
The process is based on the comparison of the actual **output signal of the Tx
under test** , received by an ideal receiver, with a **reference signal** ,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error
free received signal. The reference signal shall be composed of the same
number of codes at the correct spreading factors as contained in the test
signal. Note, for simplification, the notation below assumes only codes of one
spreading factor although the algorithm is valid for signals containing
multiple spreading factors. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) base band signals.
## C.2.2 Output signal of the Tx under test
The output signal of the Tx under test is acquired by the measuring equipment,
filtered by a matched filter (RRC characteristic with roll-off α = 0,22,
correct in shape and in position on the frequency axis) and stored for further
processing.
The following form represents the physical signal in the entire measurement
interval:
one vector **Z** , containing N = ns x sf + ma complex samples;
with
ns: [n]{.underline}umber of [s]{.underline}ymbols in the measurement interval;
sf: number of chips per symbol. (sf: [s]{.underline}preading
[f]{.underline}actor) (see Note: Symbol length)
ma: number of [m]{.underline}id[a]{.underline}mble chips, or for IMB the
number of chips in the TDM pilot region
## C.2.3 Reference signal
The reference signal is constructed by the measuring equipment according to
the relevant Tx specifications.
It is filtered by the same matched filter, mentioned in C.2.2, and stored at
the intersymbol interference free instants. The following form represents the
reference signal in the entire measurement interval:
one vector **R** , containing N = ns x sf + ma complex samples;
where ns, sf and ma have the same meaning as defined above in C.2.2.
## C.2.4 Classification of measurement results
The measurement results achieved by the global in-channel Tx test can be
classified into two types:
• **Results of type \"deviation\"** , where the error-free parameter has a
non-zero magnitude. (These are the parameters that represent the signal).
These parameters are:
RF Frequency
Power (in case of single code)
Code Domain Power (in case of multi-code)
Timing (only for UE) (see Note: Deviation)
(Additional parameters: see Note: Deviation)
• **Results of type \"residual\"** , where the error-free parameter has value
zero. (These are the parameters that represent the error values of the
measured signal; ideally, their magnitude is zero). These parameters are:
Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE)
(Additional parameters: see Note: Residual)
## C.2.5 Process definition to achieve results of type \"deviation\"
The reference signal (**R** ; see subclause C.2.3) and the signal under Test
(Z; see subclause C.2.2) are varied with respect to the parameters mentioned
in subclause C.2.4 under \"results of type deviation\" in order to achieve
best fit. Best fit is achieved when the RMS difference value between the
varied signal under test and the varied reference signal is an absolute
minimum.
Overview:
$\text{FCT}\lbrack
Z(\overset{\sim}{f},\overset{\sim}{t},\overset{\sim}{\phi},g_{1},g_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g_{\text{synch}})
-
R(f,t,\phi,{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{1},{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{synch}})\rbrack
= \text{Minimum}!$
Z: Signal under test.
R Reference signal,
with frequency f, the timing t, the phase ϕ, gain of code1 (g~1~), gain of
code2 (g~2~) etc, and the gain of the synch channel g~synch~
The parameters marked with a tilde in Z and R are varied in order to achieve a
best fit.
**R'** and **Z'** are each of length ns * sf and depending on the length of
the measurement interval result of possibly multiple successive applications
of the minimum process.
Detailed formula: see Note: Formula for the minimum process
The varied reference signal, after the best-fit process, will be called
**R'.**
The varied signal under test, after the best fit process, will be called
**Z'.**
**R'** and **Z'** are each of length ns * sf and depending on the length of
the measurement interval result of possibly multiple successive applications
of the minimum process.
Those parameter values, which - after the best-fit process -lead to **R' and
Z',** represent directly the wanted results of type \"deviation\". These
parameter values are expressed as deviations from the reference value, using
the same units as the corresponding reference value.
In the case of multi-code transmission, the best-fit process of the type
\"deviation\" parameters frequency, timing (and any additional parameter as
e.g. RF phase) is not done with respect to the individual codes, but commonly
for the complete code set used; therefore, the process returns one measurement
value only for each parameter.
(These parameters are [not]{.underline} varied on the individual codes signals
such that the process would return kr frequency errors... . (kr: number of
codes in the reference signal)).
The only type-\"deviation\"-parameters varied individually are the code domain
gain factors (g1, g2, ...)
### C.2.5.1 Decision Point Power
The mean-square value of the signal-under-test, sampled at the best estimate
of the of Intersymbol-Interference-free points using the process defined in
subclause 2.5, is referred to the _Decision Point Power_ (DPP):
### C.2.5.2 Code-Domain Power
The samples, Z', are separated into symbol intervals to create ns time-
sequential vectors **z** with sf complex samples comprising one symbol
interval. The _Code Domain Power_ is calculated according to the following
steps:
1) Take the vectors **z** defined above.
2) To achieve meaningful results it is necessary to descramble **z,** leading
to **z'**
3) Take the orthogonal vectors of the channelization code set **C** (all codes
belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213 and TS 25.223
(range +1, -1), and normalize by the norm of the vectors to produce **C**
norm=**C** /sqrt(sf). (see Note: Symbol length)
4) Calculate the inner product of **z'** with **C** norm**.**. Do this for all
symbols of the measurement interval and for all codes in the code space.\ This
gives an array of format k x ns, each value representing a specific symbol and
a specific code, which can be exploited in a variety of ways.
k: total number of codes in the code space
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval
5) Calculate k mean-square values, each mean-square value unifying ns symbols
within one code.\ (These values can be called \"_Absolute CodeDomainPower_
(CDP)\" [Volt^2^].) The sum of the k values of CDP is equal to DPP.
6) Normalize by the decision point power to obtain
## C.2.6 Process definition to achieve results of type \"residual\"
The difference between the varied reference signal (**R'** ; see
subclauseC.2.5.) and the varied Tx signal under test (**Z** ; see subclause
C.2.2) is the error vector **E** versus time:
**E** = **Z'** \- **R'.**
Depending on the parameter to be evaluated, it is appropriate to represent
**E** in one of the following two different forms:
**[Form EVM]{.underline}** (representing the physical error signal in the
entire measurement interval)
One vector **E** , containing N = ns x sf + ma complex samples;
where ns, sf and ma have the same meaning as defined above in C.2.2.
**[Form PCDE]{.underline}** (derived from Form EVM by separating the samples
into symbol intervals)
ns time-sequential vectors **e** with sf complex samples comprising one symbol
interval.
**E** gives results of type \"residual\" applying the two algorithms defined
in subclauses C.2.6.1 and C.2.6.2.
### C.2.6.1 Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
The Error Vector Magnitude EVM is calculated according to the following steps:
1) Take the error vector **E** defined in subclause C.2.6 (Form EVM) and
calculate the RMS value of **E** ; the result will be called RMS(**E**).
2) Take the varied reference vector **R** defined in subclause C.2.3 and
calculate the RMS value of **R** ; the result will be called RMS(**R**).
3) Calculate EVM according to:
{width="1.75in" height="0.4583333333333333in"} (here, EVM is relative and
expressed in %)
(see Note: TDD)
(see Note: Formula for EVM)
### C.2.6.2 Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE)
The Peak Code Domain Error is calculated according to the following steps:
1) Take the error vectors **e** defined in subclause C.2.6 (Form PCDE)
2) Take the orthogonal vectors of the spreading code set C (all codes
belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213 and TS 25.223
(range +1, -1). (see Note: Symbol length) and normalize by the norm of the
vectors to produce **C** norm= **C** /sqrt(sf). (see Note: Symbol length)
3) To achieve meaningful results, it is necessary to descramble **e,** leading
to **e'**
4) Calculate the inner product of e' with **C** norm. Do this for all symbols
of the measurement interval and for all codes in the code space.\ This gives
an array of format k x ns, each value representing an error-vector
representing a specific symbol and a specific code, which can be exploited in
a variety of ways.
k: total number of codes in the code space
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval
5) Calculate k RMS values, each RMS value unifying n symbols within one code.\
(These values can be called \"Absolute CodeEVMs\" [Volt].)
6) Find the peak value among the k \"absolute Code-EVMs\".\ (This value can be
called \"Absolute PeakCodeEVM\" [Volt].)
7) Calculate PCDE according to:
{width="3.0416666666666665in" height="0.5138888888888888in"}. (a relative
value in dB).
see Note: TDD
see Note: Synch channel
### C.2.6.3 Relative Code Domain Error (RCDE)
The Relative Code Domain Error is calculated for a wanted code according to
the following steps:
1) Calculate the value \"_Absolute CodeEVM_ \" [Volt] for the wanted code
according to C.2.6.2, as an RMS value unifying ns = 2400 symbols corresponding
to the measurement interval of one timeslot.
2) Calculate the value \"_Absolute CodeDomainPower_ (CDP)\" [Volt^2^] for the
wanted code according to C.2.5.2, with ns = 2400 symbols corresponding to the
measurement interval of one timeslot.
3) Calculate RCDE according to:
4) The average RCDE across a set of wanted codes is defined as the mean of the
linear RCDE values and subsequently expressed in dB.
# C.3 Notes
## C.3.1 Symbol length
A general code-multiplexed signal is multi-code and multi-rate. In order to
avoid unnecessary complexity, the measurement applications use a unique
symbol-length, corresponding to a specific spreading factor, regardless of the
really intended spreading factor. Nevertheless, the complexity with a multi-
code / multi-rate signal can be mastered by introducing appropriate
definitions.
## C.3.2 Deviation
It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type „deviation\", e.g. chip
clock and RF phase. However, because chip clock and RF frequency are linked
together by a statement in the core specifications [1], it is sufficient to
process RF frequency only.
The parameter RF phase must be varied within the best-fit process (C.2.5).
Although necessary, this parameter-variation does not describe any error, as
the modulation schemes used in the system do not depend on an absolute RF-
phase.
The parameter Timing must be varied within the best fit process (C.2.5.) This
parameter variation does not describe any error, when applied to the Node B
test. However when applied to the UE test, it describes the error of the UE's
Timing Advance.
## C.3.3 Residual
It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type „residual\", e.g. IQ
origin offset. As it is not the intention of the test to separate for
different error sources, but to quantify the quality of the signal, all such
parameters are not extracted by the best-fit process, instead remain part of
EVM and PCDE.
## C.3.4 TDD
EVM covers the midamble (or for IMB the TDM pilot region) part as well as the
data part; however PCDE disregards the midamble (or IMB TDM pilot) part.
## C.3.5 Synch channel
A node B signal contains a physical synch channel, which is non-orthogonal,
related to the other DPCHs. In this context note: The code channel bearing the
result of PCDE is exactly one of the DPCHs (never the synch channel). The
origin of PCDE (erroneous code power) can be any DPCH and/or the synch
channel. This means that the error due to the synch channel is projected onto
the other (orthogonal) codes that make up the code domain.
## C.3.6 Formula for the minimum process
$L(\Delta\overset{\sim}{f},\Delta\overset{\sim}{t},\Delta\overset{\sim}{\phi},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{c},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}i},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{mid}})
= \sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|Z(\nu) - R(\nu)}|^{2}$
where
L is the function to be minimised
The parameters to be varied in order to minimize are:
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{f}$ the RF frequency offset
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t}$ the timing offset
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{\phi}$ the phase offset
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{c}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}$ code power offsets
(one offset for each code)
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{mid}}$ the power offset of the midamble (or
for IMB the TDM pilot region)
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}}$ the code power offset of the primary
SCH
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}i}$ the code power offsets of secondary
SCHs, (i: 1,2,3)
($\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}}$ and
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}i}$ are only applied, if the timeslot
under test contains the synchronisation channel.)

the measurement interval and ending at its end.
N No of chips during the measurement interval.
Z(ν): Samples of the signal under Test. It is modelled as a sequence of
complex baseband samples Z(γ) with a time-shift ∆t, a frequency offset ∆f, a
phase offset ∆ϕ, the latter three with respect to the reference signal.
$Z(\nu) = Z(\nu - \Delta\overset{\sim}{t}) \ast e^{-
j2\text{πΔ}\overset{\sim}{f}\nu} \ast e^{- \text{jΔ}\overset{\sim}{\phi}}$
R(ν): Samples of the reference signal:
$\text{codes} + (g_{\text{prim}} + \Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}})
\ast \text{Chip}_{\text{prim}}(\nu) + (g_{\text{sec}i} +
\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}i}) \ast \text{Chip}_{\text{sec}i}(\nu) +
(g_{\text{mid}} + \Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{mid}}) \ast
\text{Chip}_{\text{mid}}(\nu)$
where
g nominal gain of the code channel or midamble (or for IMB the TDM pilot
region)
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{g}$ The gain offset to be varied in the minimum process
Chip(ν) is the chip sequence of the code channel or midamble (or for IMB the
TDM pilot region)
Indices at g, Δg and Chip: The index indicates the code channel:
c = 1,2,... No of code channels
prim = primary SCH
seci = three secondary SCHs, i:1,2,3
Range for Chip~c~ : +1,-1
## C.3.7 Formula for EVM
$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|Z^{'}(\gamma) -
R^{'}(\gamma)}|^{2}}{\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|R^{'}(\gamma)}|^{2}}} \ast
\text{100}\text{\%}$
Z'(γ), R'(γ) are the varied measured and reference signals.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Derivation of Test Requirements
The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by relaxing
the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the Test Tolerances
defined in subclause 5.11. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the Test
Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement. When the Test
Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ from the Minimum
Requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in tables D.1
to D.3
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case that
the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in subclause 5.10. In
this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test
tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened Test Requirements as
defined in subclause 5.12.
For example, a Test System having 0,9 dB accuracy for test 6.2 Maximum output
power (which is 0,2 dB above the limit specified in subclause 5.10.2) would
subtract 0,2 dB from the Test Tolerance of 0,7 dB defined in subclause 5.11.1.
This new test tolerance of 0,5 dB would then be applied to the Minimum
Requirement using the formula defined in Table D.1 to give a new range of ±2,5
dB of the manufacturer's rated output power.
For the case where an excess error of 0.2 dB exists, when applied to a test
with a test tolerance of zero, the test tolerance used in the formula would be
-0.2 dB.

###### ## Annex E (informative): Acceptable uncertainty of Test Equipment
This informative annex specifies the critical parameters of the components of
an overall Test System (e.g. Signal generators, Signal Analysers etc.) which
are necessary when assembling a Test System which complies with subclause 5.10
Acceptable Uncertainty of Test System. These Test Equipment parameters are
fundamental to the accuracy of the overall Test System and are unlikely to be
improved upon through System Calibration.

###### ## Annex F (normative): General rules for statistical testing
# F.1 Statistical testing of receiver BER/BLER performance
## F.1.1 Error Definition
Bit Error Ration (BER) and Block Error Ratio (BLER) are defined in section
3.1.
## F.1.2 Test Method
Each test is performed in the following manner:
a) Setup the required test conditions.
b) Record the number of samples tested and the number of occurred events (bit
error or block error)
c) Stop the test at a stop criterion which is minimum test time or an early
pass or an early fail event.
d) Once the test is stopped decide according to the pass fail decision rules (
subclause F.1.7)
## F.1.3 Test Criteria
The test shall fulfil the following requirements:
a) good pass fail decision
1) to keep reasonably low the probability (risk) of passing a bad unit for
each individual test;
2) to have high probability of passing a good unit for each individual test;
b) good balance between test time and statistical significance
3) to perform measurements with a high degree of statistical significance;
4) to keep the test time as low as possible.
## F.1.4 Calculation assumptions
### F.1.4.1 Statistical independence
a) It is assumed, that error events are rare (lim BER BLER  0) independent
statistical events. However the memory of the convolutional /turbo coder is
terminated after oneTTI. Samples and errors are summed up everyTTI. So the
assumption of independent error events is justified.
b) In the BLER test with fading there is the memory of the multipath fading
channel which interferes the statistical independence. A minimum test time is
introduced to average fluctuations of the multipath fading channel. So the
assumption of independent error events is justified approximately.
### F.1.4.2 Applied formulas
The formulas, applied to describe the BER BLER test, are based on the
following experiments:
1) After having observed a certain number of errors (**ne**) the number of
samples are counted to calculate BER BLER. Provisions are made (note 1) such
that the complementary experiment is valid as well:
2) After a certain number of samples (**ns**) the number of errors, occurred,
are counted to calculate BER BLER.
Experiment 1) stipulates to use the following Chi Square Distribution with
degree of freedom ne:
2*dchisq(2*NE,2*ne).
Experiment 2) stipulates to use the Poisson Distribution:
dpois(ne,NE)
(NE: mean of the distribution)
To determine the early stop conditions, the following inverse cumulative
operation is applied:
0.5 * qchisq(D,2*ne). This is applicable for experiment (1) and (2).
D: wrong decision risk per test step
Note: other inverse cumulative operations are available, however only this is
suited for experiment (1) and (2).
### F.1.4.3 Approximation of the distribution
The test procedure is as follows:
During a running measurement for a BS ns (number of samples) and ne (number of
errors) are accumulated and from this the preliminary BER BLER is calculated.
Then new samples up to the next error are taken. The entire past and the new
samples are basis for the next preliminary BER BLER. Depending on the result
at every step, the BS can pass, can fail or must continue the test.
As early pass- and early fail-BSs leave the statistical totality under
consideration, the experimental conditions are changed every step resulting in
a distribution that is truncated more and more towards the end of the entire
test. Such a distribution can not any more be handled analytically. The
unchanged distribution is used as an approximation to calculate the early fail
and early pass bounds.
## F.1.5 Definition of good pass fail decision
This is defined by the probability of wrong decision F at the end of the test.
The probability of a correct decision is 1-F.
The probability (risk) to fail a good DUT shall be ≤ F according to the
following definition: The failed DUT is still better than the specified error
ratio (Test requirement)with a probability of ≤ F.
The probability to pass a bad DUT shall be ≤ F according to the following
definition: The passed DUT is still worse than M times the specified error
ratio (M>1 is the bad DUT factor) with a probability of ≤ F.
This definitions lead to an early pass and an early fail limit:
Early fail: ber≥ berlim~fail~
$\text{ber}\text{lim}_{\text{fail}}(D,\text{ne}) = \frac{2 \ast
\text{ne}}{\text{qchisq}(D,2 \ast \text{ne})}$ (1)
For ne≥ 7
Early pass: ber ≤berlimbad~pass~
$\text{ber}\text{lim}\text{bad}_{\text{pass}}(D,\text{ne}) = \frac{2 \ast
\text{ne} \ast M}{\text{qchisq}(1 - D,2 \ast \text{ne})}$ (2)
For ne ≥ 1
With
ber (normalized BER,BLER): BER,BLER according to F.1.1 divided by Test
requirement
D: wrong decision probability for a test step . This is a numerically
evaluated fraction of F, the wrong decision probability at the end of the
test. See table F.1.
ne: Number of error events
M: bad DUT factor see table F.1.
qchisq: inverse-cumulative-function of the chi-squared-distribution
## F.1.6 Good balance between test time and statistical significance
Three independent test parameters are introduced into the test and shown in
Table F.1. These are the obvious basis of test time and statistical
significance. From the first two of them four dependent test parameters are

The minimum test time is derived from the following justification:
1) For no propagation conditions and static propagation condition
No early fail calculated from fractional number of errors \ No stop of the test until [990] wavelengths are crossed during relevant BS
> reception timeslots, relevant for BER BLER testing, with the speed given in
> the fading profile.
3) For high speed train condition
> Scenario 1: 82.3s. This corresponds to 4 complete cycles of approach towards
> and departure leave to and from a BS antenna
>
> Scenario 3: 28.8s. This corresponds to 4 complete cycles of approach towards
> and departure from a BS antenna

In tables F.4 and F.5 the minimum test time is converted in minimum number of
samples.
## F.1.7 Pass fail decision rules
No decision is allowed before the minimum test time is elapsed.
1) If minimum Test time \345.
A typical BER BLER test, calculated from the number of samples and errors
(F.1.2.(b)) using experimental method (1) or (2) (see F.1.4.2 calculation
assumptions) runs along the yellow trajectory. With an errorless sample the
trajectory goes down vertically. With an erroneous sample it jumps up right.
The tester checks if the BER BLER test intersects the early fail or early pass
limits. The real time processing can be reduced by the following actions:
BLER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test (Note
1)). is calculated only in case of an error event.
BER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test (Note 1)).
is calculated only in case of an error event within a TTI.
So the early fail limit cannot be missed by errorless samples.
The check against the early pass limit may be done by transforming formula (2)
in F.1.5 such that the tester checks against a
[L]{.underline}imit-[N]{.underline}umber-of-samples ( NL(ne)) depending on the
current number of errors (including the artificial error at the beginning of
the test (Note 1)).
Early pass if
$\text{NL}(\text{ne}) \geq \frac{\text{qchisq}(1 - D,2 \ast \text{ne})}{2 \ast
\text{TR} \ast M}$
TR: test requirement (0.001)
Figure F.1
NOTE 1: At the beginning of the test, an artificial error is introduced. This
ensures that an ideal DUT meets the valid range of the early pass limit. In
addition this ensures that the complementary experiment (F.1.4.2 bullet point
(2)) is applicable as well.
> For the check against the early fail limit the artificial erroneous sample,
> introduced at the beginning of the test , is disregarded.
Due to the nature of the test, namely discrete error events, the early fail
condition shall not be valid, when fractional errors \<1 are used to calculate
the early fail limit: Any early fail decision is postponed until number of
errors ne ≥7. In the blocking test any early fail decision is postponed until
number of errors ne ≥ 8.
NOTE 2: F=0.2% is intended to be used for a test containing a few BER/BLER
tests (e.g. receiver sensitivity is repeated 12 times(3 RF Channels * 2 Power-
supplies * 2 Temperatures). For a test containing many BER/BLER tests (e.g.
blocking test) this value is not appropriate for a single BER/BLER test.
The blocking test contains approx. 12750 single BER tests. A DUT on the limit
will fail approx. 25 to 26 times due to statistical reasons using wrong
decision probability at the end of the test F= 0.2%. This shall be solved by
the following rule:
All passes (based on F=0.2%) are accepted, including the wrong decisions due
to statistical reasons.
An early fail limit based on F=0.02% instead of 0.2% is established. That
ensures that wrong decisions due to statistical reasons are reduced to 2 to 3
in 12750 BER measurements. If the fail cases are ≤12, it is allowed to repeat
each fail cases 1 time before the final verdict.
These asymmetric test conditions ensure that a DUT on the limit consumes
hardly more test time for a blocking test than in the symmetric case and
reduces the wrong decision probability considerably and on the other hand the
repetition allowance sufficiently suppresses the residual statistically caused
wrong verdict for the aggregate test.
