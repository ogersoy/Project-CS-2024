# 0 Scope
The present document describes the supplementary services belonging to the
group Charging Supplementary Services.
The general aspects, including definitions and recommended provision, of the
description of the supplementary services are given in TS 22.004 [2].
Charging services are the supplementary services associated with charging
aspects. The group of supplementary services Charging Supplementary Services
comprises two services:
\- Advice of Charge (Information) - clause 1;
\- Advice of Charge (Charging) - clause 2.
Advice of Charge (AoC) supplementary services will use the Charge Advice
Information described in 22.024 [3].
In principle, the same type of Mobile Station (MS) can be used for both
services of Advice of Charge (AoC), except where the application demands
special features - e.g. the payment mechanism in a payphone.
Only one of these services may be subscribed to at any one time.

## 0.2 Abbreviations
Abbreviations used in the present document are listed in TS 21.905 [1].
# 1 Advice Of Charge (Information) (AoCI)
## 1.1 Definition
This service permits MS to display an accurate estimate the size of the bill
which will eventually be levied in the Home PLMN.
## 1.2 Description
### 1.2.1 Description
This supplementary service provides the MS with the information to produce an
estimate of the cost of the service used. Charges are indicated for the
call(s) in progress when mobile originated or for the roaming leg only when
mobile terminated. Any charges for non-call related transactions, and for
certain supplementary services, such as Call Forwarding are not indicated.
The MS will receive at the beginning of each call (and as necessary during the
call) a message, the Charge Advice Information. This message contains the
elements which together define the rate at which the call is to be charged,
time dependence, data dependence and for unit increments - see TS 22.024 [3].
The MS shall still indicate appropriate charges even when roaming, based on
Home PLMN units.
Where applicable, the volume charge for Packet data service, in addition to
the normal time dependent and incremental charges, shall be indicated.
To indicate the charge per call the Mobile station shall display the units
consumed so far during the present call(s) and maintain this value until the
MS is switched off or a new call set-up is attempted.
Where required to indicate the total accumulated charge, the MS shall be able
to display, and the SIM/USIM shall store in the ACM, the running cumulative
unit charge. This value must be stored securely, and all reasonable steps
shall be taken to ensure that the written value cannot be interrupted, reset
or corrupted (except resetting under control of the unblocking key).
### 1.2.2 Applicability to telecommunication services
The applicability of this supplementary service is defined in TS 22.004 [2].
## 1.3 Normal procedures with successful outcome
### 1.3.1 Provision
This supplementary service will be provided after prearrangement with the
service provider.
### 1.3.2 Withdrawal
This service will be withdrawn at the subscriber\'s request or for
administrative reasons.
### 1.3.5 Activation
This supplementary service will be activated by the service provider as a
result of provision.
### 1.3.6 Deactivation
This supplementary service will be deactivated by the service provider as a
result of withdrawal.
### 1.3.7 Invocation
This supplementary service will be automatically invoked by the network for
the use of all applicable telecommunications services.
### 1.3.8 Normal operation with successful outcome
For every applicable usage of telecommunications services, the served MS will
be provided with charging information.
The MS shall send to the network a confirmation of receipt of this
information.
## 1.4 Exceptional procedures or unsuccessful outcome
### 1.4.1 Operation in a PLMN that is unable to support AoC
Since AoC (Information) is used only to provide an indication to the user,
even if the network is unable to support AoC, calls may still be set up as
normal, only the AoC indication will not be given. For this reason charges
incurred on a network that is unable to support AoC will not be shown on the
AoC indicator.
### 1.4.2 AoC when MS is switched off or out of coverage
No AoC information is given by the network.
### 1.4.3 Operation with a MS unable to support AoC
Since AoC (Information) is used only to provide an indication to the user,
even if the ME is unable to support AoC, calls may still be set up as normal,
only no AoC information will be provided to the user.
## 1.5 Alternate procedures
None identified.
## 1.6 Interactions with other supplementary services
### 1.6.1 SCUDIF
When the MS requires a bearer change, e.g. from Audio to Video or vice versa,
the SCUDIF Mode modify procedure is performed as described in TS 23.172 [5].
Depending on the operator's policy, the success of the procedure may trigger a
Facility message to convey new values for the CAI parameters. On receipt of
new CAI values triggered by a service change based on the SCUDIF supplementary
service, the MS shall reset CDUR and continue incrementing the CCM using the
new CAI parameters. The MS shall add initial units to the CCM and measure
units on a time basis using the new values.
### 1.6.2 Other supplementary services
No interaction.
Invocation of this supplementary service does not prevent use of any other
Supplementary Service.
## Multicall
See TS 22.135 [4].
## 1.7 Interworking considerations
When interworking with PSPDN, a volume related charge may be incurred, as
described in TS 22.024 [3].
# 2 Advice Of Charge (Charging) (AoCC)
## 2.1 Definition
This service provides the means by which the MS may indicate the charge that
will be made for the use of telecommunication services. It is intended for
applications where the user is generally not the subscriber but is known to
the subscriber, and where the user pays the subscriber, rather than the
Service Provider.
The charge information is based as closely as possible on the charge that will
be levied on the subscriber\'s bill in the Home PLMN. Where this charge cannot
be stored in the MS, use of the telecommunications service shall be prevented
as described below.
## 2.2 Description
### 2.2.1 Description
This supplementary service provides the MS with the information to produce an
estimate of the cost of the service used. Charges are indicated for the
call(s) in progress when mobile originated or for the roaming leg only when

Where applicable, the volume charge for Packet data service, in addition to
the normal time dependent and incremental charges, shall be indicated.
To indicate the charge per call the Mobile station shall display the units

## 2.3 Normal procedures with successful outcome
### 2.3.1 Provision
This supplementary service will be provided after pre-arrangement with the
service provider.
### 2.3.2 Withdrawal
This service will be withdrawn at the subscriber\'s request or for
administrative reasons.
### 2.3.5 Activation

result of withdrawal.
### 2.3.7 Invocation
This supplementary service will be automatically invoked by the network for
the use of all applicable telecommunications services.
### 2.3.8 Normal operation with successful outcome
For every applicable usage of telecommunication services, the served MS will
be provided with charging information.
The MS shall send to the network a confirmation of receipt of this
information.
## 2.4 Exceptional procedures or unsuccessful outcome
### 2.4.1 Operation in a PLMN that is unable to support the Charging Service
If the local PLMN is unable to support this service, all chargeable calls
shall be prevented. This is determined either by the use of an HLR list of
VPLMNs which support the service, or by the HLR interrogating the VPLMN.
Prevention is achieved by refusing a Location Update Request to the VPLMN that
does not support the service.
### 2.4.2 Charging when the MS is switched off or out of coverage
No AoC information is given by the network.
### 2.4.3 Operation with a MS unable to support AoC
If the MS does not support AoC, no advice of charge information will be
provided to the user. Any calls attempted to be set up will be quickly
terminated, once the network has failed to receive a positive acknowledgement
of receipt of the Charge Advice Information, within a suitable time.
## 2.5 Alternate procedures
None identified.
## 2.6 Interactions with other supplementary services
### 2.6.1 SCUDIF
When the MS requires a bearer change, e.g. from Audio to Video or vice versa,
the SCUDIF Mode modify procedure is performed as described in TS 23.172 [5].
Depending on the operator's policy, the success of the procedure may trigger a
Facility message to convey new values for the CAI parameters. On receipt of
new CAI values triggered by a service change based on the SCUDIF supplementary
service, the MS shall reset CDUR and continue incrementing the CCM using the
new CAI parameters. The MS shall add initial units to the CCM and measure
units on a time basis using the new values.
### 2.6.2 Other supplementary services
No interaction.
Invocation of this supplementary service does not prevent use of any other
Supplementary Service, but in certain cases no charging information will be
indicated. In this case, the subscriber should not subscribe to those
Supplementary Services which need to be charged for, thereby inhibiting their
use by another user.
## 2.7 Interworking considerations
When interworking with PSPDN, a volume related charge may be incurred, as
described in TS 22.024 [3].
