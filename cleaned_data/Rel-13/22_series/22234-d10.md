# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
**This document provides an index to the set of specifications for
interworking between 3GPP systems and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)**.
No further changes to this specification are intended. If any future evolution
of the procedures in this specification is necessary, it should be documented
in other specifications.
# 1 Scope
**This document provides an index to the set of specifications for
interworking between 3GPP systems and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)**.
Maintenance of the I-WLAN feature is discontinued as of Release 12. No further
changes to this specification are intended. If any future evolution of the
procedures in this specification is necessary, it should be documented in
other specifications.
