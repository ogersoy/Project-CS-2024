# Introduction
The present document covers requirements for Mission Critical Push To Talk
(MCPTT) service (represented by the term, MCPTT Service). The MCPTT Service
can be used for public safety applications and also for general commercial
applications (e.g., utility companies and railways). The specifications
contained within the present document can also form the basis for a non-
mission critical Push To Talk service (called a PTT service).
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the service requirements for operation of the
MCPTT Service. MCPTT makes use of capabilities included in Group
Communications System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) and Proximity Services
(ProSe), with additional requirements specific to the MCPTT Service. The MCPTT
Service can be used for public safety applications and also for general
commercial applications (e.g., utility companies and railways).

# 4 Mission Critical Push To Talk overview
## 4.1 General
A Push To Talk service provides an arbitrated method by which two or more
users may engage in communication. Users may request permission to transmit
(e.g., traditionally by means of a press of a button). The Mission Critical
Push To Talk over LTE (MCPTT) service supports an enhanced PTT service,
suitable for mission critical scenarios, based upon 3GPP Evolved Packet System
(EPS) services. The requirements for Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT)
service defined within can also form the basis for a non-mission critical Push
To Talk (PTT) service.
The MCPTT Service is intended to support communication between several users
(a group call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the
permission to talk in an arbitrated manner. However, the MCPTT Service also
supports Private Calls between pairs of users. The MCPTT Service builds on the
existing 3GPP transport communication mechanisms provided by the EPS
architectures to establish, maintain, and terminate the actual communication
path(s) among the users.
The MCPTT Service also builds upon service enablers: GCSE_LTE and ProSe. To
the extent feasible, it is expected that the end user\'s experience to be
similar regardless if the MCPTT Service is used under coverage of an EPC
network or based on ProSe without network coverage. To clarify this intent,
the requirements are grouped according to applicability to on-network use,
off-network use, or both.
Though the MCPTT Service primarily focuses on the use of LTE there might be
users who access the MCPTT Service through non-3GPP access technology,
dispatchers and administrators are examples of this. Dispatchers and
administrators are special users who have particular admin and call management
privileges which normal users might not have. In MCPTT dispatchers can use an
MCPTT UE (i.e., LTE) or a non-3GPP access connection to the MCPTT Service
based on a \"dispatcher and Administrator\" interface. Through this interface
a user is able to access and manage the services related to on the network and
those common to on the network and off the network.
The MCPTT Service allows users to request the permission to talk (transmit
voice/audio) and provides a deterministic mechanism to arbitrate between
requests that are in contention (i.e., Floor control). When multiple requests
occur, the determination of which user\'s request is accepted and which
users\' requests are rejected or queued is based upon a number of
characteristics (including the respective priorities of the users in
contention). MCPTT Service provides a means for a user with higher priority
(e.g., MCPTT Emergency condition) to override (interrupt) the current talker.
MCPTT Service also supports a mechanism to limit the time a user talks (hold
the floor) thus permitting users of the same or lower priority a chance to
gain the floor.
The MCPTT Service provides the means for a user to monitor activity on a
number of separate calls and enables the user to switch focus to a chosen
call. An MCPTT Service user may join an already established MCPTT Group call
(Late call entry). In addition the MCPTT Service provides the User ID of the
current speaker(s) and user\'s Location determination features.
The users of an MCPTT Service may have more stringent expectations of
performance than the users of a commercial PTT service.
MCPTT is primarily targeting to provide a professional Push To Talk service to
e.g., public safety, transport companies, utilities or industrial and nuclear
plants. In addition to this a commercial PTT service for non-professional use
(e.g., groups of people on holiday) may be delivered through an MCPTT system.
Based on their operational model, the performance and MCPTT features in use
vary per user organization, where functionality which is more mission critical
specific (e.g., Ambient Listening and Imminent Peril Call) might not be
available to commercial customers.
MCPTT Users expect to communicate with other MCPTT Users as outlined above,
however MCPTT Users also need to be able to communicate with non MCPTT Users
using their MCPTT UEs for normal telephony services.
## 4.2 Typical use of the MCPTT Service
NOTE: Even though this subclause is written from an organization specific
perspective the text is illustrative for typical use of MCPTT Services by all
MCPTT Users.
Public safety workers often operate in groups and perform different tasks
during the day/week. Many tasks and operations are controlled, assisted and/or
coordinated by a dispatcher.
For their communications public safety workers are organized in groups. People
that are working together communicate in the same MCPTT Group, the group
communication helping them to coordinate quickly.
People with different tasks often communicate in separate MCPTT Groups.
Many of the public safety tasks are routine tasks, that are handled by
standard procedures and communication structures, using dedicated MCPTT
Groups. Communication structures and MCPTT Groups are also prepared for the
handling of large incidents and control of large events. Similarly there are
MCPTT Groups and procedures for coordination with public safety workers from
other organizations and/or other countries.
The standard procedures and communication structures help the public safety
workers to do their work successfully. This results in a long list of (>100)
MCPTT Groups available to a public safety worker, from which the correct one
is selected depending on the task. To help the public safety worker to quickly
find and select the correct MCPTT Group for the task, the MCPTT Groups in the
radio are often structured in folders and/or accessible via key-shortcuts. In
addition to pre-established MCPTT Groups that users select, there are also
provisions in MCPTT systems to merge MCPTT Groups and to select on behalf of a
user which group they should be using and for a dispatcher to push them onto
it. The large number of MCPTT Groups provisioned on devices is helpful for the
device to be able to operate on the network and off the network. However the
ability to provision over the air is also seen as a very useful feature, as
currently Land Mobile Radio devices often have to be locally re-programmed,
rather than updated over the air.
## 4.3 Overview of MCPTT Group affiliation, call and transmission
An MCPTT Service provides Group Call and Private Call capabilities, which have
various process flows, states and permissions associated with them. The figure
4.3.1, figure 4.3.2, and figure 4.3.3 indicate the high level flows, states
and permissions associated with Group Calls and Private Calls. The diagrams
apply to the on-network case and off-network case, as from a user perspective
the service and concepts should appear similar on the network and off the
network. From a technical perspective there might be differences between the
on-network states and off-network states (e.g., off the network Affiliation
might not require notifying an application server of a user\'s affiliation and
there might also be other differences in the detail depending on the extent to
which the off-network capabilities can match the on-network capabilities).
If an MCPTT User wants to communicate with an MCPTT Group they have to be
allowed to access the MCPTT Group (i.e., be an MCPTT Group Member), they then
have to affiliate and then can have an MCPTT Group as their Selected MCPTT
Group. If an MCPTT User is only affiliated to a group this is so that they can
receive from the group, however if an MCPTT User has a Selected MCPTT Group
this is their group for transmitting on. The differences in states enable an
MCPTT User to receive from multiple MCPTT Groups, but specify which MCPTT
Group they would like to transmit on.

Figure 4.3.3: MCPTT User state diagram- receive only for a particular MCPTT
Group
It is possible for an MCPTT User to be affiliated with one or more MCPTT
Groups. Normally, while in operation, an MCPTT User informs the MCPTT Service
about which MCPTT Groups he would like to be affiliated to. These affiliations
remain in effect until the MCPTT User removes them, or changes them, or signs
out of the service. Some MCPTT Users have permanent affiliations to certain
MCPTT Groups and those affiliations are set up implicitly (i.e.,
automatically) when operating on the network. For those users, the MCPTT Group
affiliation starts when the MCPTT Service successfully signs in the user and
ends when the MCPTT User\'s explicit or implicit (e.g., due to inactivity or
the turning off of all its devices) request to sign out of the MCPTT Service
is acknowledged.
Every time a PTT request is granted a user can start an MCPTT transmission or
\"talk burst\". An MCPTT Group Call consists of one or more MCPTT
transmissions. Whether two consecutive transmissions from same or different
users are part of the same call, or the second transmission starts a new call,
depends on the configurable maximum length of the inactivity period between
the consecutive MCPTT transmissions. This inactivity period can be seen as a
Hang Time that starts at the end of the preceding transmission. While this
timer is running, the resources associated with the call stay assigned to the
call (except in case of pre-emption), which could reduce the latency of future
floor requests for this group versus groups who are not involved in a call.
When a new transmission starts during the inactivity period, the timer is
stopped, reset and restarted again at the end of that transmission.
The MCPTT Service recognizes a number of \"special\" group calls including:
Broadcast Group Call, Emergency Group Call and Imminent Peril group call.
A Broadcast Group Call can be seen as a special group call with only one MCPTT
transmission.
While the In-progress Emergency state or In-progress Imminent Peril state is
active, the inactivity period is conceptually set to infinity; i.e., the
resources assigned to calls during these states are never released (except in
case of pre-emption). An MCPTT Emergency Group Call or an Imminent Peril group
call can be seen as having an unspecified number of transmissions:
essentially, all the transmissions to a group during In-progress Emergency
state or In-progress Imminent Peril are part of the same MCPTT Group Call.
Conditions on starting (\"commencement\") and continuing an MCPTT call can be
established. Usually at least the call initiator (but also other users) are
kept informed via notifications of the starting, stopping, queuing, etc., of a
call.
In general, commencement conditions are related to the presence on the call
(i.e., participation) of certain members of the group, and/or of a minimum
number of members, as well as on the availability of resources (e.g., GBR
bearers) of proper ARP. If the commencement conditions are not met, the call
does not start (it can be queued or rejected). Normally, commencement
conditions are not checked for individual transmission within a call.
Continuation conditions are similar (though not required to be identical) to
commencement conditions and get re-evaluated when pre-emption, degradation of
priority, motion out of communication range, de-selection of the group or de-
affiliation (explicit or implicit) occur. If the continuation conditions are
not met, the call stops.
## 4.4 General handling of requests
Request handling is by no means specific only to MCPTT Service, but it plays a
central role in its functionality.
Requests appear in the MCPTT Service in many forms and under many
circumstances: e.g., requests for the floor during a call, requests for
starting a call, requests for resources. Conceptually, requests are
accompanied by priority information that is used in the arbitration, in case
of contention; see also subclause 4.6 for a brief explanation and examples on
how priority processing is modelled.
Upon arrival, a request is immediately granted, denied, or queued.
If queued, a request can be dropped due to queue overflow (i.e., too many
items queued) or can be cancelled by an authorized user, who is usually the
initiator of the request. Either way, the net result is that the request is
denied.
When a request denial is communicated, the request may be re-requested either
manually by user action or automatically. In the automatic case, while the
request remains denied, it may be automatically repeated a configurable number
of times where a minimum time interval between re-transmissions may also be
applied.
There are many \"queuing disciplines\" possible that govern the placement of
items in a queue and their subsequent removal from the queue: e.g., FIFO,
priority order. Assuming that the queuing discipline chosen places the highest
priority requests towards the top of the queue, the granted request is either,
depending on the design and configuration, the front-most entry in the queue
or the first entry counting from the top that can be satisfied by the
available resources. For example, if the topmost entry in the queue is
awaiting for ten GBR bearers of given characteristics to become available and
the second entry in the queue is waiting for seven GBR bearers to become
available, and at some point in time eight GBR bearers become available, then
it is possible that the second request is granted ahead of the first one,
which continues to wait. Alternatively, neither the first request nor the
second request is granted and the wait continues until at least ten GBR
bearers become available, at which time the first request is granted while the
second request continues to wait.
## 4.5 Overview of MCPTT UE and MCPTT User in the MCPTT Service
The MCPTT Service supports MCPTT User Profiles. The MCPTT User Profile
contains important information related to the MCPTT User receiving the MCPTT
Service, including the MCPTT User identity, which is globally unique and
independent of the mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) assigned by a 3GPP
network operator. Part of the content of the MCPTT User Profile (e.g.,
containing some display preferences, some UE audio settings, some address
books) can be set/modified/updated by the MCPTT User, but significant portions
might be set/modified/updated only by authorized persons. The MCPTT User
Profile is stored permanently in database(s) associated with the
infrastructure providing the MCPTT Service. Relevant parts of the profile
might be downloaded to and cached temporarily or permanently on certain MCPTT
UEs. When stored on an MCPTT UE, the MCPTT User Profile associated with an
MCPTT User might be confidentiality and integrity protected, with the
information available only to a trusted application client associated to the
MCPTT User, upon authentication. The MCPTT User Profile information can be
synchronized automatically or on demand between the cache on the MCPTT UE and
the main copy held in the database(s) of the MCPTT Service infrastructure. The
MCPTT User Profile is part of the MCPTT application service domain and forms
the basis of MCPTT application layer security and identifies an MCPTT User to
the MCPTT Service.
Each MCPTT User has at least one MCPTT User Profile, and possibly several.
Typically, one of the MCPTT User Profiles is designated as the default MCPTT
User Profile, to be used unless an MCPTT User Profile is explicitly selected.
In general, a user profile is associated with a specific device, with a
specific mode of operation (i.e., on the network or off the network) and/or
with a specific situation (e.g., user being off-duty, in a certain city, or
playing a certain role). When an MCPTT User Profile is synchronized between
the infrastructure and an MCPTT device, information could be downloaded to the
device and updated, as necessary. Subsequently and subject to permissions, the
MCPTT User might choose a different associated MCPTT User Profile to be
downloaded and stored on the device. Only one MCPTT User Profile is active at
a time. Authorized users are allowed to create, delete and alter MCPTT User
Profiles for an MCPTT User and/or pre-stored MCPTT User Profiles.
The MCPTT Service supports MCPTT UEs which connect to the MCPTT Service. The
capabilities of an MCPTT UE are specified in the present document. The MCPTT
Application that is resident on the MCPTT UE establishes this connection,
employing application layer security in its connection to the MCPTT Service.
An MCPTT UE is capable of operating in on-network and off-network modes.
### 4.5.1 MCPTT User association to MCPTT UE in on-network mode
Consistent with the EPS paradigm, when an MCPTT UE is powered on, it accesses
the LTE system, and connects to the EPC. During this phase, the credentials
from a USIM application (or possibly, an ISIM application, if IMS is used) on
a UICC associated with the MCPTT UE is used for authentication with an HSS.
This is followed by the MCPTT Application, resident on the MCPTT UE,
establishing a connection, employing application layer security in its
connection to the MCPTT Service.
Possibilities for the MCPTT UE, when connecting to the MCPTT Service:
\- An MCPTT UE, with credentials of an MCPTT User at the time of connection to
the MCPTT Service, is able to authenticate using a specific MCPTT User
identity (e.g., via an Identity Management service). After successful user
authentication the MCPTT User Profiles are made available to the MCPTT UE for
use in both on-network and off-network operation modes.
\- An MCPTT UE, without credentials of a specific MCPTT User at the time of
connection to the MCPTT Service, proceeds using a default identity associated
with the MCPTT UE itself. In this case, the MCPTT Service is capable of
assigning a temporary MCPTT User Identity to this MCPTT UE. Some level of
authentication might be attempted, and, depending on the results, an
appropriate MCPTT User Profile associated with this temporary MCPTT User
Identity and with the circumstances of the access is made available to the
MCPTT UE for use in both on-network and off-network operation modes.
\- The MCPTT Administrator is able to retrieve hardware and software
parameters to define specific parameters and attributes (e.g., groups, MCPTT
Emergency behaviour, priority and QoS attributes) associated with a temporary
MCPTT User Identity for operation of the MCPTT UE for use in both on-network
and off-network operation modes.
### 4.5.2 MCPTT User and MCPTT UE relationship
A user can enter his identifying/authenticating credentials (e.g., user name/
password, PIN, biometrics, asserted identity from a remote, trusted device).
This step typically gives the MCPTT User access to local information and
applications stored on the MCPTT UE, and in particular, to the MCPTT client
application.
The MCPTT Service allows the same MCPTT User to sign in (and stay
simultaneously signed in) from different MCPTT UEs. For example, an incident
manager or commander might use a portable phone, a command tablet, or a
separate messaging unit.
### 4.5.3 MCPTT Users accessing the service through non-3GPP access interface
This document primarily focuses on MCPTT Users accessing and managing the
MCPTT Service through MCPTT UEs, however there might be some dispatchers and
administrators who might access the service through a non-3GPP access
interface.
### 4.5.4 Shareable MCPTT UEs and gateway UEs
The conceptual model for shareable MCPTT UEs is that of a pool of UEs, each UE
being interchangeable with any other, and users randomly choosing one or more
UEs from the pool, each user for his temporary exclusive use. A shareable
MCPTT UE can be used by user who can gain access to the MCPTT client
application stored on it and can become an authenticated MCPTT User. A
shareable MCPTT UE can serve only one MCPTT User at a time. An MCPTT User who
signs into a shareable MCPTT UE that is already in-use causes the sign-off of
the previous MCPTT User.
An MCPTT User can simultaneously have several active MCPTT UEs, which, from an
MCPTT Service point of view, are addressable individually and/or collectively
within the context of their association to the MCPTT User.
The conceptual model for a gateway UE is that of a UE capable of providing
service to an MCPTT User employing a non-3GPP device. A gateway UE is usable
simultaneously by multiple MCPTT Users. Unlike a shareable MCPTT UE, if a new
person enters his valid credentials towards signing in the MCPTT Service, his
successful signing in and becoming an MCPTT User does not affect the initial
MCPTT Users already served by the gateway UE.
A gateway UE is typically installed in a vehicle (e.g., a police car, fire
truck) and has wired and/or wireless connections to various devices in use by
the MCPTT Users.
A gateway UE differs functionally from a ProSe relay node. In the ProSe
paradigm, the relay node and the devices served by it are all (ProSe enabled)
LTE UEs, and are \"visible\" to the EPS as UEs. In the gateway UE paradigm,
only the gateway UE is an LTE device and only it is \"visible\" at the EPS
layer.
Figure 4.5.4.1 shows schematically some of the relationships between MCPTT
Users and MCPTT UEs.
Figure 4.5.4-1: Relationships between MCPTT Users and MCPTT UEs
### 4.5.5 MCPTT User association to MCPTT UE in off-network mode
A user can enter his identifying/authenticating credentials (e.g., user name/
password, PIN, biometrics, asserted identity from a remote, trusted device).
This step typically gives the MCPTT User access to local information and
applications stored on the MCPTT UE, and in particular, to the MCPTT client
application.
After successful local user authentication an MCPTT User Profile, which was
previously made available to the MCPTT UE, is used for off-network operation
mode. This previously configured MCPTT User Profile information allows the
MCPTT User to be identified using the same MCPTT User Identity as in the on-
network mode.
An MCPTT UE, without credentials of a specific MCPTT User, operates in off-
network mode, if so configured by an MCPTT Administrator. The MCPTT
Administrator defines specific parameters and attributes (e.g., groups, MCPTT
Emergency behaviour, priority and QoS attributes) associated with a temporary
MCPTT User Identity for operation of the MCPTT UE in off-network operation
mode.
## 4.6 Overview of MCPTT priorities
### 4.6.1 MCPTT priority model
Many LTE non-public safety users today subscribe to one particular priority
and QoS level of service (e.g., \"gold\", \"silver\" or \"bronze\"), which
always provides fixed differentiation. This model, effective and relatively
straightforward for non-public safety users, falls short when it comes to the
needs of the public safety applications.
MCPTT Priority and QoS is situational. The MCPTT Service is intended to
provide a real-time priority and QoS experience for MCPTT calls, as public
safety users have significant dynamic operational conditions that determine
their priority. For example, the type of incident a responder is serving or
the responder\'s overall shift role needs to strongly influence a user\'s
ability to obtain resources from the LTE system.
Another feature of a mission critical service is transparency of interactions
between the users and the system. A first responder that needs to change the
QoS of his communications is not to be distracted from his mission due to
complicated UE behaviours or service interactions. Instead, the service acts
in an anticipatory and adaptive manner to provide the proper quality of
experience to the user, automatically, or with simple and minimal interaction.
The mission critical service is also expected to provide the ability to
interface with public safety systems (e.g., Computer Aided Dispatch) in order
to determine the user\'s state (e.g., incident severity), environment and
conditions and to affect the most appropriate priority and QoS experience for
the user.
The MCPTT Priority handling for on-network use for MCPTT Calls is conceptually
modelled as shown in figure 4.6.1.1. The conceptual model identifies three
areas of prioritization: prioritization between and within calls, inter-system
prioritization, and prioritization at the transport layer (EPS and UE). At the
Application Layer a generic, network side, functional entity, \"MCPTT Priority
and QoS Control\", processes with each request static, preconfigured
information about users and groups participating in MCPTT, as well as dynamic
(or situational) information about them. Based on the results of this
processing, the \"MCPTT Priority and QoS Control\" provides information to and
directs interactions with other functional entities, systems, or layers to
ensure, to the extent possible, that from a quality of experience point of
view, calls and transmissions are handled properly in accordance to
established policy rules.

Figure 4.6.1-1: A conceptual on-network MCPTT priority model
The User Static Attributes include information categorizing the user, possibly
by several criteria (e.g., first responder, second responder, supervisor,
dispatcher, administrator), as well as jurisdictional boundaries and possibly
a preconfigured system-wide individual priority level.
The Group Static Attributes include information about the nature/type of the
group and the owning organization(s), the jurisdictional boundaries for
transmitters and receivers within the group, the normal hours of operation for
the group, pre-emption dispositions relative to other groups, and the default
minimum priority of the group, i.e., the minimum priority characteristics that
are provided to all the Participants in a group call associated with this
group, regardless of their individual priority characteristics.
The User Dynamic Attributes include the user/Participant\'s operational status
(e.g., on/off duty), his location, the type of incident (e.g., MCPTT Emergency
or Imminent Peril) he might be involved in and whether or not he initiated it,
whether or not he is individually involved in a formally managed incident and
if yes, the boundaries of the incident area, the incident severity and his
assigned role in the resolution of the incident.
The Group Dynamic Attributes include the type of incident (e.g., MCPTT
Emergency or Imminent Peril), if any, the group is currently handling and in
case of involvement in a formally managed incident the boundaries of the
incident area and the incident severity.
### 4.6.2 Generic processing of priority information
This functionality applies to MCPTT Call initiations and transmissions for the
management of potentially contended resources (e.g., GBR bearers) and also for
Floor control during an MCPTT Group Call.
Each request for exclusive access to resource(s) or for preferential treatment
over a contending request arrives accompanied by priority information. This
information stays associated with the companion request, whether the request
is granted or is queued. The priority information is used for comparison
between requests and facilitates the adding and removing of requests from
queues and/or authorized interruption of service associated with a previously
granted request, if still active. For each request, whether initially queued
or not, the requesting party is informed (directly or indirectly) when his
request is granted or denied. Other users/Participants are also notified of
the disposition of a request and the notification includes the identity of the
requestor, as needed. In addition, each requestor can be notified of the
position of his request in the queue and he is allowed to cancel his requests
while queued.
### 4.6.3 Handling of MCPTT priority information for Floor control
Floor control is applied in the context of a single MCPTT Call and is
triggered by a Participant request for the permission to transmit. Priority
information accompanies each grant request.
### 4.6.4 Handling of MCPTT priority information for interactions at the
transport layer
At the Transport Layer, the MCPTT Service uses LTE controls to adapt the
overall behaviour of the MCPTT System to the needs for resources and/or
preferential treatment over other contenders, based on the priority
information accompanying the request.
The following four LTE controls are available, to be used as necessary, based
on the phase of the MCPTT call:
  * EPS Access Controls;
  * UE Access Controls;
  * EPS Admission Controls; and
  * EPS Scheduling Controls.
EPS Access Controls and UE Access Controls are used to allow preferential
treatment of public safety UEs in situations of access congestion. The
controls use LTE priority and QoS mechanisms (e.g., using mechanisms like
Access Class Barring, Service Specific Access Control, Access Control for
Circuit Switched Fallback, Extended Access Barring).
Admission Controls are used for the establishment and maintenance of the
priority levels and of the pre-emption vulnerability and capability of bearers
associated with transmissions and calls. At the start of an MCPTT call, the
MCPTT Service requires bearers with proper ARP and pre-emption characteristics
are in place prior to the call proceeding.
Scheduling Controls (e.g., QCI and bandwidth for the bearers) are used for
assuring the appropriate QoS necessary for meeting the Participants\'
expectation in the perceived quality of the delivered information, primarily
in terms of when the service starts and the real-time characteristics of the
delivered traffic (e.g., perceived delay, choppiness, clarity).
### 4.6.5 Handling of MCPTT priority information for interactions with non-LTE
PTT systems
An MCPTT call can be mixed, with some Participants served by one
network/system and other Participants served by a different
network(s)/system(s). In general the systems can be quite different. For
example, some Participants use MCPTT/LTE, while others could use a P25-based
system.
### 4.6.6 MCPTT priority for Private Call
The MCPTT Service uses User Static Attributes of the Participants, potentially
adjusted based on User Dynamic Attributes, if applicable. By default, the
priority of an MCPTT Private Call is the same as the priority of the
originator of the call. Similar to group calls there are MCPTT Emergency
Private Calls (with Floor control), which also have a similarly high priority.
These are used where there is immediate danger to the user and are typically
used to communicate with a dispatcher.
## 4.7 Overview of MCPTT identifiers
The main identifiable entities in use by the MCPTT Service are Mission
Critical Organizations, MCPTT Groups, MCPTT Users, and MCPTT Administrators.
The UEs are identified at the transport or network layer, but in some
situations they might also be identified by the MCPTT Service. Each
identifiable entity is distinct from all others and has an identifier (ID)
associated to it, unique within a proximate identity domain. Those domains
correspond to identifiable entities and can be nested within other domains in
a multi-level hierarchical fashion. For example an MCPTT User might have an
identifier unique within the domain corresponding to a Mission Critical
Organization. The top-down concatenation of identifiers can generate unique
identifiers within larger contexts, eventually leading to the identifiers
being globally unique.
Each identifier can be associated with one or more aliases, which can be used
for displaying and selection purposes. Some aliases are shortened equivalents
of the identifier used for efficient signalling and are not intended for human
interactions. At a minimum, each entity has one alias (default) which is the
alphanumeric representation of its identifier. Most entities have a main
alias, which is the entity\'s name. Some aliases can be pictures, icons or
other graphic representations. It is up to the implementation to decide if
aliases have to be unique and if so, within which domain. Finally, some
aliases are public, can be created/deleted only by authorized persons and are
available to the MCPTT Service, while other aliases are private, can be
created/deleted by their owners and might be residing only on certain UEs or
be part of some private address books.
It is possible in principle for User IDs, Group IDs, as well as for aliases,
to be defined system wide with certain values, but have different values for
each application: e.g., the system wide User ID might be different from the
MCPTT User ID and different from the video User ID for the same user. However,
this type of separation might not be beneficial, and in practice only one
identifier is likely to be used.
For simplicity, the term \"User ID\" is employed to identify an MCPTT User,
without distinction of whether it is an identifier or an alias.

## 5.4 Dynamic group management (i.e., dynamic regrouping)
NOTE: No common on-network and off-network dynamic group management
requirements have been identified.
## 5.5 Receiving from multiple MCPTT calls
### 5.5.1 Overview
MCPTT Users receive call traffic of their affiliated MCPTT Groups. This
multiple receiving, called monitoring by some organizations, provides MCPTT
Users current information about police, fire or critical medical events that
are occurring within their jurisdictions. This is useful for dispatchers or
those that might not be the primary support for that event at that moment. The
information gained by monitoring might be useful for the dispatcher to
determine any actions to take or be useful later if the MCPTT User is deployed
to provide additional support for that event. The MCPTT User might be assigned
to support the activities of more than one MCPTT Group on the same shift. This
means that the MCPTT User receives multiple MCPTT Groups.
An MCPTT User with limited speaker resources (e.g., a handheld UE) might find
that playing out concurrent received audio from multiple active MCPTT Groups
becomes confusing and could also cause undesired voice distortion for the
receiving user. During periods of time when the MCPTT User is receiving audio
from multiple MCPTT Groups, which MCPTT Group\'s audio is presented to the
MCPTT User is determined by the MCPTT User\'s choice, the priority associated
with the talker of the Selected MCPTT Group(s), other considerations or
combinations of these. The MCPTT UE is aware of all the active groups to which
the MCPTT User has affiliated or selected and the identity of the other active
receiving groups is available for display on the MCPTT UE. When the receive
activity from the Selected MCPTT Group stops, the MCPTT UE might present the
audio from the next group per the MCPTT User\'s choice or by other means.
If none of the multiple groups to which the MCPTT User has affiliated or
selected is active, the MCPTT UE would continue to monitor for activity by any
of the multiple affiliated or Selected MCPTT Groups. Monitoring for activity
of multiple MCPTT Groups is also known as scanning and the list of the
multiple groups is also known as a scan list.
### 5.5.2 Requirements
[R-5.5.2-001] Void

[R-5.5.2-012] The MCPTT Service shall allow an authorized MCPTT UE to receive
on-network MCPTT Groups and off-network MCPTT Groups simultaneously.
[R-5.5.2-013] The MCPTT Service shall ensure that if there is an MCPTT
Emergency Group Call on one of the MCPTT Groups that an MCPTT User is
affiliated to, but that user is already in a lower priority MCPTT Group call
or Private Call (with floor control), that the MCPTT User automatically hears
the MCPTT Emergency Group Call.
NOTE: Depending on the MCPTT User\'s settings and/or the MCPTT UE capability
the above requirement could mean that the MCPTT User stops receiving from
another MCPTT Group (which might normally have a higher priority) or a Private
Call (with floor control).
## 5.6 Private Call
### 5.6.1 Private Call overview
Private Calls allow two MCPTT Users to communicate directly with each other
without the use of MCPTT Groups. They leverage many of the functions and
features of MCPTT Group Calls, such as MCPTT User identity and alias
information, location information, encryption, privacy, priority, and
administrative control. Private Calls can use Floor control or not (i.e., be
full voice duplex calls between users), though Private Calls without Floor
control are only supported on the network.
Two commencement modes of Private Calls are supported: Manual Commencement
Private Call and Automatic Commencement Private Call. The two commencement
modes can be used in conjunction with Private Calls with/without Floor
control.
Manual Commencement Private Calls mimic a telephone conversation where the
called party receives a notification that they are being requested to join a
Private Call, and the called party may accept, reject, or ignore the call
request. Once the call setup is accepted, the Private Call is established and
both Participants may communicate with each other.
Automatic Commencement Private Calls mimic the immediate setup and voice
propagation of Group Call operation between two users where the calling party
initiates an Automatic Commencement Private Call to another user and sends
audio without any additional call setup delay beyond Group Calls. If available
and able to accept the Private Call from the calling party, the called party
immediately joins the Private Call and processes the calling party\'s audio.

Floor control).
[R-5.6.2-002] The MCPTT Service shall support Private Calls with Floor
control.
[R-5.6.2-003] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for an authorized

Floor control) setup has failed to the calling MCPTT User.
[R-5.6.2-004] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for the Private Call
(with Floor control) to be set up with the MCPTT UE designated by the called

which the MCPTT UE\'s current MCPTT User is authorized.
NOTE 2: For off-network use, only an MCPTT UE within communication range
(possibly via a ProSe UE-to-UE Relay) receives the transmission.
[R-5.6.3-006] The MCPTT Service shall provide a means by which an MCPTT User
initiates a Manual Commencement Private Call (with Floor control) to any MCPTT
User for which the MCPTT User is authorized.
[R-5.6.3-007] The MCPTT Service shall require that the called MCPTT User
accepts a Manual Commencement Private Call (with Floor control) setup request
before the call proceeds.

accept a Manual Commencement Private Call (with Floor control) request from
another MCPTT User.
[R-5.6.3-009] The MCPTT Service shall provide a means by which an MCPTT User
initiates an Automatic Commencement Private Call (with Floor control) to any
MCPTT User for which the MCPTT User is authorized.
[R-5.6.3-010] The MCPTT UE shall support automatic commencement mode and
manual commencement mode for Private Calls (with Floor control).

request from another MCPTT User.
NOTE 2: Ignoring a Manual Commencement Private Call (with Floor control)
results in no indication of the reason for call failure being sent to the
calling MCPTT User.
[R-5.6.4-003] The MCPTT Service shall provide a means by which an MCPTT User
ends a Private Call (with Floor control) in which the MCPTT User is a

## 5.7 MCPTT priority requirements
### 5.7.1 Overview
MCPTT Emergency Group Call and MCPTT Imminent Peril group call are MCPTT Group
Calls that provide the MCPTT User elevated priority towards obtaining
resources of the MCPTT system. The MCPTT Emergency Private Call similarly
provides elevated priority to resources of the MCPTT system. The MCPTT
Emergency Alert provides a notification of an MCPTT Emergency situation from
an MCPTT UE, regardless if the user is signed in with the MCPTT Service or
not.
The MCPTT Emergency Alert is initiated from an MCPTT UE to inform the MCPTT
Service of the user\'s immediate need of assistance due to the user\'s
personal, life-threatening situation. If the user is not properly
authenticated, he is treated as a temporary MCPTT User with limited
permissions. The user initiates this notification by actuating a user
interface on the MCPTT UE. The notification to the MCPTT Service includes the
MCPTT User\'s ID, potentially an MCPTT Group ID, the user\'s Mission Critical
Organization name and the most current location available for the user\'s
MCPTT UE.
The user profile/group configuration determines which MCPTT Group ID is used,
if any. If the user profile indicates that a dedicated (i.e., not used for
everyday traffic) MCPTT Emergency Group is to be used, then the MCPTT
Emergency call traffic moves to a different group. MCPTT Users that support
MCPTT Emergency situations are required to monitor the dedicated MCPTT
Emergency Group(s) for call activity. If the user profile indicates that the
selected (i.e., currently active) MCPTT Group is to be used, then its Group ID
is used, unless no group is selected.
After the MCPTT User has initiated an MCPTT Emergency Alert, MCPTT Emergency
Private Call or MCPTT Emergency Group Call, the MCPTT User is considered to be
in the MCPTT Emergency State. The user remains in the MCPTT Emergency State
until the MCPTT User cancels the MCPTT Emergency State.
An MCPTT Group Call started by an MCPTT User while in the MCPTT Emergency
State or previously started but followed by an MCPTT Emergency Alert becomes
an MCPTT Emergency Group Call. The MCPTT Group ID used for the MCPTT Emergency
Group Call is the same MCPTT Group ID included in the MCPTT Emergency Alert.
An MCPTT User or dispatcher might initiate an MCPTT Emergency Group Call
without an MCPTT Emergency Alert. The start of an MCPTT Emergency Group Call
starts an In-progress Emergency condition for the MCPTT Group. Any subsequent
MCPTT Group Call made by any MCPTT Group Member of an MCPTT Group which has an
In-progress Emergency is treated as an MCPTT Emergency Group Call. MCPTT
Emergency Group priority is removed when the In-progress Emergency for the
group is cancelled.
An MCPTT Private Call started by an MCPTT User while in the MCPTT Emergency
State becomes an MCPTT Emergency Private Call.
MCPTT Imminent Peril group call is differentiated from MCPTT Emergency Group
Call based on for whom the assistance is required. The MCPTT Emergency Group
Call is initiated by an MCPTT User for assistance for the MCPTT Emergency
condition involving that user. The MCPTT Imminent Peril group call is
initiated by an MCPTT User for assistance to other MCPTT Users or persons of
the general public observed to be in trouble and may soon need assistance.
There is no MCPTT Imminent Peril Alert and no MCPTT Imminent Peril State for
MCPTT Users. The granting of an MCPTT Imminent Peril group call starts an In-
progress Imminent Peril condition for the MCPTT Group. Any subsequent MCPTT
Group Call made by any MCPTT Group Member of an MCPTT Group which has an In-
progress Imminent Peril condition is treated as an MCPTT Imminent Peril group
call. MCPTT Imminent Peril Group priority is removed when the In-progress
Imminent Peril for the group is cancelled.

#### 6.6.2.1 Service description
Group Regrouping enables dispatchers or any authorized user to temporarily
combine MCPTT Groups. A dispatcher uses Group Regrouping for different
reasons.
Due to an incident in an area it can be necessary to temporarily enable MCPTT
Users from different MCPTT Groups to communicate to each other to coordinate.
After the incident the dispatcher cancels the Group Regrouping and the MCPTT
Users continue with their original configured MCPTT Groups.
During quiet periods control room managers can decide to combine MCPTT Groups
and handle their operations and communications with one dispatcher. In the
busier period the Group Regrouping is cancelled and the MCPTT Groups are

#### 6.6.4 User regrouping
#### 6.6.4.1 Service description
In the operational MCPTT environment most tasks are covered by standard
procedures and communication structures and MCPTT Users can easily access the
MCPTT Groups to handle their tasks.
Exceptionally it could happen that there is an urgent need for a dedicated set
of individual MCPTT Users to communicate in an MCPTT Group, but that this is
not foreseen in the communication structure. This could be due to extreme
conditions or due to a cooperation that is outside normal procedures.
User Regrouping enables dispatchers or authorized users to instantaneously
provide a dedicated MCPTT Group to these MCPTT Users to enable the required
communication. Depending on configuration the MCPTT Users could be
automatically affiliated to this MCPTT Group. After the operation this MCPTT
Group is removed by the dispatcher or authorized user.
#### 6.6.4.2 Requirements

the parameters for a particular User Regroup operation, such that an
authorized MCPTT User activates this preconfigured User Regroup and
communicate with this temporary group with minimal delay.
NOTE: An example of the use of this functionality is for an MCPTT User to
communicate with particular other MCPTT Users within a predefined radius of
the MCPTT User\'s Location. This functionality is likely to be for urgent type
calls such as MCPTT Emergency Group Calls.
[R-6.6.4.2-004] The MCPTT Service shall notify MCPTT Users when they are
affected by a User Regroup operation.
[R-6.6.4.2-005] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for an MCPTT

operations (e.g., encryption and message authentication) spanning the totality
of required cryptographic operations for MCPTT. That is, if MCPTT requires a
stream cipher, a message authentication code, and a secure hash, then counter-
mode AES-256, CMAC with AES-256 as an underlying cipher, and SHA-512 would
constitute a cryptographic suite for MCPTT.

in one MCPTT Private Call (without Floor control) at a time.
## 6.15 Audio MCPTT call performance
### 6.15.1 General overview
Meeting the KPIs defined in the following subclauses is based on a number of
factors, including the selection of appropriate protocols, minimizing
messaging, the backhaul technology used, and appropriate configuration of the
deployed network. The corresponding requirements are intended to convey the
resulting KPIs when all of those factors are taken into account. For example,
where there is significant backhaul delay, that delay is expected to be added
to the KPIs.
### 6.15.2 General requirements
[R-6.15.2-001] The architecture and protocols providing the MCPTT Service
shall be designed in a way to eventually allow a deployed network to meet the
KPIs specified hereafter (subclause 6.15.3.2 and subclause 6.15.4.2).
### 6.15.3 MCPTT access time and mouth-to-ear latency
#### 6.15.3.1 General overview
For MCPTT Users, one of the most important performance criteria is the MCPTT
Access time (KPI 1). The MCPTT Access time is defined as the time between when
an MCPTT User request to speak (normally by pressing the MCPTT control on the
MCPTT UE) and when this user gets a signal to start speaking. This time does
not include confirmations from receiving users.
The MCPTT Access time (KPI 1) does not include the time for an MCPTT User to
affiliate to the group. This is a common scenario within public safety,
meaning that affiliations to MCPTT Groups are long lived during several
working hours. KPI 1 is applicable in both an MCPTT Group call setup request
and subsequent MCPTT Requests that are part of the same call. KPI 1 for
subsequent MCPTT Requests might take a slightly shorter time than the first
MCPTT setup request of the same call due to its potential need of resource
allocation in terms of bearer establishment. However from an end user
perspective there is no need to differentiate required performance for an
MCPPT Group call setup request and subsequent MCPTT Requests.
The End-to-end MCPTT Access time (KPI 2) is defined as the time between when
an MCPTT User requests to speak (normally by pressing the MCPTT control on the
MCPTT UE) and when this user gets a signal to start speaking, including MCPTT
call establishment (if applicable) and possibly acknowledgement from first
receiving user before voice can be transmitted. Group calls can be set up with
or without acknowledgements from receiving users. A typical case for the End-
to-end MCPTT Access time including acknowledgement is an MCPTT Private Call
(with Floor control) request where the receiving user\'s client accepts the
call automatically.
NOTE: The End-to-end MCPTT Access time (KPI 2) is not applicable for an MCPTT
Group transmission call setup when no acknowledgement is requested from any
Affiliated MCPTT Group Member.
The Mouth-to-ear latency (KPI 3) is the time between an utterance by the
transmitting user, and the playback of the utterance at the receiving user\'s
speaker. Figure 6.15.3.1.1 illustrates the MCPTT Access time and Mouth-to-ear
latency.

user.
[R-6.15.3.2-017] There shall be no (0 ms) trailing lost audio at the end of
the voice burst at receiving user.
### 6.15.4 Late call entry performance
#### 6.15.4.1 General overview
An MCPTT User is able to join or leave already ongoing MCPTT Group calls. Late
call entry is the activity when an Affiliated MCPTT Group Member joins an
MCPTT Group call in which other Affiliated MCPTT Group Members are already
active. The Late call entry time (KPI 4) is the time to enter an ongoing MCPTT
Group call measured from the time that a user decides to monitor such an MCPTT
Group Call, to the time when the MCPTT UE\'s speaker starts to play the audio.
The performance requirements for Late call entry time only applies to when
there is ongoing voice transmitted at the time the MCPTT User joins the call.
In a Late call entry there might be an initial lost audio of the voice burst
sent to the new Receiving MCPTT Group Member. Figure 6.15.4.1.1 illustrates
the Late call entry time.
{width="6.496527777777778in" height="3.7708333333333335in"}

[R-6.16.1-001] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for an authorized
MCPTT User to receive MCPTT Group or Private Call transmissions from any MCPTT
User within their authority without noticeable impact on or knowledge of the
MCPTT User.
### 6.16.2 Ambient listening
#### 6.16.2.1 Overview of ambient listening
Ambient Listening is a feature that allows an authorized MCPTT User, typically
a dispatcher, to cause an MCPTT UE to initiate a call which results in no
indication on the MCPTT UE that it is transmitting. Ambient Listening can be
initiated by an authorized MCPTT User who wants to be listened to by another
remote authorized MCPTT User or can be initiated by a remote authorized MCPTT
User who wants to listen to another MCPTT User. The purpose of this feature
allows a dispatcher to listen to activities at the Location of the remote
MCPTT UE to find out what is happening around that MCPTT UE without providing
an indication to the MCPTT User or people around the user (whom the MCPTT User
does not want to make aware of this action) that this is happening. This type
of call is different from other types of call, as for Ambient Listening audio
is only transmitted to one party in the call (i.e., a dispatcher or an
authorized MCPTT User that is acting in a similar role to a dispatcher).
This is used for stolen MCPTT UEs, monitoring officers, officer safety and
particular operations, where it is important that the MCPTT UE does not
indicate what is happening.
#### 6.16.2.2 Ambient listening requirements
##### 6.16.2.2.1 General Ambient Listening requirements
[R-6.16.2.2.1-001] The MCPTT UE that is being listened to shall be the only
transmitting party in the Private Call.
[R-6.16.2.2.1-002] For an MCPTT UE that is being listened to there shall be no
indication on the MCPTT UE that it is transmitting.
[R-6.16.2.2.1-003] If someone attempts to turn off an MCPTT UE that is being
listened to it shall appear to be turned off even while Ambient Listening
continues to be active.
[R-6.16.2.2.1-004] The MCPTT Service shall terminate Ambient Listening if the
MCPTT User being listened to starts to transmit in an MCPTT Private Call or an
MCPTT Group Call.
NOTE: An authorized MCPTT User could initiate Discreet Listening at this point
if needed.
##### 6.16.2.2.2 Remotely initiated Ambient Listening requirements
[R-6.16.2.2.2-001] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism to allow an
MCPTT Administrator and/or an authorized user to set up Ambient Listening on a
remote MCPTT UE within their authority.
[R-6.16.2.2.2-002] The MCPTT Service shall ensure that Ambient Listening
triggered remotely is terminated only by the remote authorized MCPTT User
(e.g., a dispatcher).
##### 6.16.2.2.3 Locally initiated Ambient Listening requirements
[R-6.16.2.2.3-001] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism to allow an
authorized MCPTT User to use the MCPTT UE that the MCPTT User is currently
using to initiate Ambient Listening to another authorized MCPTT User (e.g., a
dispatcher).
[R-6.16.2.2.3-002] The MCPTT Service shall ensure that Ambient Listening
triggered locally can be terminated by the MCPTT User being listened to or by
the remote MCPTT Administrator and/or authorized user, who was the listening
Participant.
### 6.16.3 Remotely initiated MCPTT call
### 6.16.3.1 Overview
A Remotely initiated MCPTT Call is a feature that allows an authorized user,
typically a dispatcher, to cause a remote MCPTT UE to initiate a call by
itself, without its user explicitly initiating the call by depressing the PTT
switch. The purpose of this feature allows the dispatcher to listen to
activities at the Location of the remote MCPTT UE to find out what is
happening around that MCPTT UE. This feature is also known as \"Remote Unit
Monitoring\" in P25 systems.
There are two typical use cases for this feature.
The first one is the case where a user could have been incapacitated. This
could be both accidentally, say a traffic accident, or deliberately, for
example a violent attack. In both cases it would be necessary to remotely open
the microphone of the MCPTT UE in order to allow another user or a group of
users to listen to what is happening to prepare assistance. The communication
that is set up is either a Private Call or a Group Call, and the call could
optionally be visible to the remote MCPTT UE\'s user.
The second one is the case of a stolen MCPTT UE. Here it is just necessary to
activate the radio so that a dispatcher can listen to any background noise or
speech in order to make an analysis of the situation. In this situation, the
initiation of the call from the remote MCPTT UE, typically a Private Call in
that case, is not visible by that MCPTT UE\'s user.
Other use cases, such as undercover operations, discreet surveillance of users
or investigations, could exist depending on the missions of the critical
communications users and on legislations.
The behaviour of the remotely initiated Call is not different from a normal
call initiated by the local user. The same rules for resource allocation and
interactions with other services apply, but the initiator of the feature can
have the capability to request a pre-emptive or high priority for that Call to
ensure it is set up even in case of resource congestion or to limit
disturbance by other services.

# 7 MCPTT Service requirements specific to off-network use
## 7.1 Off-network Push To Talk overview
The MCPTT Service while operating in off-network mode comprises a set or
collection of functions necessary to provide Mission Critical Push To Talk
over LTE (MCPTT) using a ProSe E-UTRA direct (UE-to-UE) Communication path
(ProSe direct communication path) for transport. The ProSe direct
communication path does not traverse the network infrastructure.
Users operating off the network are either out of network coverage (not served
by E-UTRAN) (e.g., in a remote mountain area fighting a forest fire 20 miles
from the nearest network) or have selected a ProSe direct communication path
for MCPTT while in network coverage. MCPTT Users operating off the network
need to be in ProSe direct communication range in order to communicate.
NOTE 1: While the network is likely to be a primary, reliable transport of
MCPTT communications, there are many situations where MCPTT communications are
needed in areas where the network is not available, or coverage is not
reliable.
MCPTT Users outside of the coverage of the fixed network might be first
responders in a rural area assisting in a response to a plane crash, fire
fighters in a remote mountain area fighting a forest fire or police officers
inside a residence responding to a domestic issue. Off-network MCPTT
communications are expected to be immediately accessible to users in the
absence of the network.
MCPTT Users in network coverage might be working in a confined area, such as
fire fighters fighting a structure fire where direct UE-to-UE communication is
more desirable and reliable. Users can communicate directly with one another
without having to overcome the resistance of a building and distance to the
nearest base station to communicate with other members of their team inside
the building that are nearby.
To operate off the network, an MCPTT UE is capable of automatically switching
to a ProSe direct communication path for use of MCPTT when detecting an off-
network (out of coverage) condition. In addition a mechanism is provided for
an authorized user to select (manually switch to) a ProSe direct communication
path for use of off-network MCPTT communications (e.g., while in network
coverage).
When operating off the network, the MCPTT Service is provided by the MCPTT
application on the UE as compared to operations on the network, where the
MCPTT Application on the UE interacts with an MCPTT server and the network to
provide the MCPTT Service.
NOTE 2: For MCPTT UEs that have selected a ProSe E-UTRA Direct Communication
path for use of MCPTT while in network coverage, signalling with the network
and MCPTT Service might be available (e.g., radio resource allocation, MCPTT
User Profile management updates and cryptographic key management updates),
while the MCPTT User transmissions would be direct between the MCPTT UEs
(e.g., not traversing the network).
The Off-Network MCPTT Service builds upon ProSe enablers to establish,
maintain and terminate the signalling and communication path(s) among the off-
network users. To the extent feasible, it is expected that the end user\'s
experience is similar regardless if the MCPTT Service is used with an EPC
network or based on the use of a ProSe direct communication path.
The Off-Network MCPTT Service is intended to support communication between a
group of users (a group call), where each user has the ability to gain access
to the permission to talk in an arbitrated manner. However, the MCPTT Service
also supports Private Calls between pairs of users.
When operating off the network the MCPTT Service allows users to request the
permission to talk (transmit voice/audio) and provides a deterministic
mechanism to arbitrate between requests that are in contention (i.e., Floor
control).
The Off-Network MCPTT Service provides a means for a user with higher priority
(e.g., MCPTT Emergency condition) to override (interrupt) the current talker.
The Off-Network MCPTT Service also supports a mechanism to limit the time a
user talks (hold the floor) thus permitting users of the same or lower
priority a chance to gain the floor.
The Off-Network MCPTT Service provides the means for a user to monitor
activity on a number of separate calls and enables the user to switch focus to
a chosen call. An Off-Network MCPTT Service user might join an already
established MCPTT Group call (Late call entry). In addition the Off-Network
MCPTT Service supports User IDs, aliases and user Location determination
features.
For operation off the network (e.g., when out of network coverage), an MCPTT
UE is (pre-)provisioned by an MCPTT Administrator and/or authorized user with
the following in order to use MCPTT:
a) An MCPTT User Profile associated with each of the intended MCPTT > Users of
the MCPTT UE that might be used for off-network > operation;
```{=html}
``` 1) An alphanumeric identifier (with a minimum length of N3) (i.e., >
alias) for each MCPTT User;
2) A number of off-network MCPTT Groups for use by the MCPTT User;
3) An alphanumeric identifier (i. e., alias) for the authorized > off-network
MCPTT Groups;
4) A Mission Critical Organization name if available, associated with > each
of the intended MCPTT Users or Administrator;
5) A number of off-network MCPTT Users for Private Call for which the > MCPTT
User is authorized;
```{=html}
``` b) Authentication and end to end security keys.
NOTE 3: MCPTT UEs can be provisioned for off-network use by either
configuration outside of network coverage or by attaching to the network.
An MCPTT UE operating off the network is capable of transmitting the talker
Location information, User ID, alias(es), off-network MCPTT Group ID, group
alias and, if available, Mission Critical Organization name of the user who is
talking (i.e., whose UE is transmitting) to all other users in a call
including MCPTT UEs operating off the network that are late entering a call in
progress.
The Off-Network MCPTT Service uses the capabilities defined in ProSe TS 22.278
[5], including the ProSe Relay capabilities defined in ProSe TS 22.278 [5] and
GCSE_LTE TS 22.468 [6].
NOTE 4: As indicated in TS 22.278 [5] use of a ProSe Direct Communication path
outside of network coverage is only applicable for Public Safety ProSe enabled
UEs. For non-Public Safety ProSe enabled UEs the selection of the most
appropriate communication path (ProSe Communication path (direct or routed via
local eNB) or EPC path) is under network control and based on operator
preferences.
MCPTT Service requirements specific to off-network use are defined in clause
7. Common MCPTT service requirements defined in clause 5 apply whether the
MCPTT Service is in use on the network or off the network.

the MCPTT UE that might be used for off-network > operation:
```{=html}
``` 1) alphanumeric identifier (i.e., Alias ID) for the authorized > off-
network MCPTT Groups;
2) a number of off-network MCPTT Groups for use by an MCPTT User;
3) a User ID associated with each of the intended MCPTT Users;
4) an alphanumeric identifier (with a minimum length of N3) (i.e., > alias)
for each User ID.
```{=html}
``` b) authentication and end to end security keys.

For MCPTT Users, one of the most important performance criteria is the MCPTT
Access time (KPI 1). The MCPTT Access time is defined as the time between when
an MCPTT User requests to speak (normally by pressing the MCPTT control on the
UE) and when this user gets a signal to start speaking. This time does not
include confirmations from receiving users.
The Mouth-to-ear latency (KPI 3) is the time between an utterance by the
transmitting user, and the playback of the utterance at the receiving user\'s
speaker. Figure 7.11.1.1.1 illustrates the MCPTT Access time and Mouth-to-ear
latency.

#### 7.11.1.2 Requirements
NOTE: The MCPTT Access time and Mouth-to-ear latency for off-network use is
FFS.
### 7.11.2 Late call entry performance
#### 7.11.2.1 General overview
An MCPTT User is able to join or leave an already ongoing MCPTT Group Call.
Late call entry is the activity when an Affiliated MCPTT Group Member joins an
MCPTT Group Call in which other Affiliated MCPTT Group Members are already
active. The Late call entry time (KPI 4) is the time to enter an ongoing MCPTT
Group Call measured from the time that the user decides to monitor such an
MCPTT Group Call, to the time when the UE\'s speaker starts to play the audio.
The performance requirements for Late call entry time only applies to when
there is ongoing voice transmitted at the time the MCPTT User joins the call.
In a Late call entry there might be an initial lost audio of the voice burst
sent to the new Receiving MCPTT Group Member.
#### 7.11.2.2 Requirements
NOTE: The Late call entry time (KPI 4) for off-network use is FFS.
### 7.11.3 Audio / Voice quality
[R-7.11.3-001] Void.
## 7.12 Off-network MCPTT operations
[R-7.12-001] Off-Network MCPTT Services shall be able to operate in the
complete absence of any fixed infrastructure.
[R-7.12-002] Off-Network MCPTT Services shall only be available for authorized
users.
[R-7.12-003] The MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for an MCPTT
Administrator to authorize users for Off-Network MCPTT Services.
## 7.13 Off-network UE functionality
[R-7.13-001] An MCPTT UE shall be capable of off-network MCPTT communications
and on-network MCPTT communications at the same time.
NOTE: Subclause 7A.2 in TS 22.278 specifies requirements for concurrent
communications on and off the network within the same group, concurrent
communications on and off the network with different groups, and concurrent
communications on and off the network involving both groups and Private Calls.
This concurrent communication is not defined as a ProSe relay.
[R-7.13-002] When switching from on-network to off-network operation (either
manually or automatically), an MCPTT UE should attempt to notify the MCPTT
Service that it is leaving the network.
[R-7.13-003] Prior to automatically going off the network an MCPTT UE should
attempt to make use of suitable ProSe UE-to-Network Relay in its proximity.
[R-7.13-004] Off-network MCPTT UEs shall support a minimum number of (N8)
simultaneous off-network MCPTT calls.
## 7.14 Switching to off-network MCPTT
[R-7.14-001] An MCPTT UE shall be capable of automatically switching to a
ProSe direct communications path for use of MCPTT when detecting an off-
network (out of coverage) condition.
[R-7.14-002] A means shall be provided for an authorized MCPTT User to be able
to manually switch between on-network operation and a ProSe direct
communication path for use of Off-Network MCPTT Service while in network
coverage.
[R-7.14-003] Subject to operator policy and/or network authorization, a means
shall be provided for an authorized MCPTT User using a Public Safety ProSe-
enabled UE to be able to manually switch between the on-network operation and
a ProSe direct communication path for use of Off-Network MCPTT Service while
in network coverage or out of network coverage.
## 7.15 Off-network recording and audit requirements
[R-7.15-001] The Off-Network MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism to
collect metadata for MCPTT Group Calls and MCPTT Private Calls (e.g.,
initiating MCPTT User ID, MCPTT Group ID) and non-call activities (e.g.,
changing group settings) from MCPTT UEs operating in off-network mode.
Metadata shall be logged for both the transmitting Participant and the
receiving Participant(s).
[R-7.15-002] Upon return to on-network operation, the MCPTT Service shall
provide a mechanism to retrieve call and non-call activity metadata from an
MCPTT UE that has collected such metadata while operating in off-network mode.
## 7.16 Off-network UE-to-UE Relay
### 7.16.1 Private Calls
[R-7.16.1-001] The Off-Network MCPTT Service shall provide a means by which
the MCPTT User of a (source) UE can make an MCPTT Private Call to the MCPTT
User of a (target) UE via a ProSe UE-to-UE Relay.
[R-7.16.1-002] The Off-Network MCPTT Service shall provide a mechanism for a
source MCPTT User to query whether a particular target MCPTT User is within
ProSe direct communication range.
[R-7.16.1-003] An MCPTT UE shall be able to:
  * discover whether the UE of the target MCPTT User is itself within > direct communication range of the source UE; and if not
  * instead discover whether the UE of the target MCPTT User is within > communication range of a ProSe UE-to-UE Relay that is within > direct communication range of the source UE.
### 7.16.2 Group Calls
[R-7.16.2-001] An MCPTT Administrator or authorized user shall be able to
configure a ProSe-enabled UE, authorized to act as a ProSe UE-to-UE Relay, to
relay any received MCPTT transmissions for one (or more) specified MCPTT
Groups.
[R-7.16.2-002] An MCPTT UE receiving both the original MCPTT Group
transmission and a relayed transmission shall be able to associate the two
transmissions, correctly order a mixture of packets (received directly and
indirectly) and identify duplicate packets.
