# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Voice Activity Detector (VAD) used in the
Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) of the EVS Codec. Although the main
application of the VAD algorithm is the detection of speech or voice signals,
the algorithm is more accurately described as a Signal Activity Detection
(SAD) algorithm.
The present document is a high level overview of the functionality with
reference to the Codec Detailed Algorithmic Description where the
functionality is specified in detail.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 4 General
The function of the Enhanced Voice Services coder VAD algorithm, or more
accurately the SAD algorithm, is to indicate whether each 20 ms frame contains
signals that should be transmitted, e.g. speech, music or other audio. The
output of the SAD algorithm is a Boolean flag ({width="0.3333333333333333in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}) that is set to one for the active signal,
which is any useful signal bearing some meaningful information. Otherwise, the
flag is set to zero indicating an inactive signal, which has no meaningful
information. The inactive signal is mostly a pause or background noise.
The procedure of the present document is mandatory for implementation in all
network entities and User Equipment (UE)s supporting the EVS coder.
The present document does not describe the ANSI-C code of this procedure. In
the case of discrepancy between the procedure described in the present
document and its ANSI-C code specifications contained in [4] the procedure
defined by the [4] prevails.
# 5 The SAD Algorithm
The Enhanced Voice Services codec signal activity detection (SAD) module
described in the present document consists of three sub-SAD modules; SAD1,
SAD2 and SAD3.
SAD1 and SAD2 are combined initially to provide an efficient preliminary
activity decision. This preliminary decision is then modified by the third
sub-SAD module, SAD3, depending upon the codec mode of operation.
The efficient preliminary activity output is used as the final SAD decision
for the AMR-WB IO modes, while the activity output with SAD3 is used as the
final SAD decision for all other bit-rates.
Sub-clause 5.1.12 in [3] describes the operation of the SAD and the algorithms
involved in the three sub-SAD modules in detail.
