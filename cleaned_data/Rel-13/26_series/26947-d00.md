# Introduction
The on-going commercialization of LTE networks has precipitated increasing
interest in the deployment of eMBMS. As the industry is considering the first
deployments of eMBMS it is important to enhance the performance and usability
of its core features.
After development of the initial MBMS specifications, SA4 has focused its
subsequent work on adding new features to the service. While application layer
FEC usage in support of download and streaming delivery methods have been
specified since Rel-6, those mechanisms have not been updated to reflect
performance improvement developments in more recent years. Examples of ongoing
FEC enhancement efforts are the latest activities in IETF's RMT and FECFRAME
working groups. Such FEC improvements can also provide more efficient support
of MBMS use cases.
The objective of this TR is to document the progress of the work item to
investigate and evaluate proposed FEC technologies and, if appropriate, adopt
one which provides the most significant enhancement to the performance of the
MBMS system over the Rel-6 application layer FEC in MBMS. Aspects of system
performance, which would provide benefit to the system, include, but are not
limited to
  * Improving the bandwidth efficiency of streaming and download services delivery over MBMS
  * Improving the reliability of streaming and download services delivery over MBMS, e.g. by increasing the amount of tolerable lost packets for a given FEC overhead
  * Reducing the required computational and memory resources for decoding in UEs
  * Addressing backward compatibility issues by considering deployments of pre-Rel-11 MBMS FEC
The evaluation and selection process for the proposed improvements is
documented in this TR.

# 4 Use of FEC in MBMS
## 4.1 Introduction
Application Layer FEC is used in MBMS to compensate remaining losses on or
below the IP layer in unidirectional delivery environments.
## 4.2 Architecture
Figure 1 depicts the MBMS network architecture showing MBMS related entities
involved in providing MBMS user services as specified in TS 26.346 [3] with
special focus to the FEC component. The FEC is included in the MBMS User
Services which are part of the BM-SC on the network side and MBMS receiver on
the UE side. FEC is specifically included in the File Delivery over
Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE) [4] protocol and the Forward Error Correction
(FEC) Framework (FECFRAME) [6] protocol.

## 4.3 MBMS Bearer in UTRAN
The MBMS UTRAN Bearer service reuses most of the legacy UMTS protocol stack in
the packet-switched domain. Only minor modifications are introduced to support
MBMS. The IP packets are processed in the Packet Data Convergence Protocol
(PDCP) layer where for example header compression might be applied. In the
Radio Link Control (RLC) the resulting PDCP-Protocol Data Units (PDUs),
generally of arbitrary length, are mapped to fixed length RLC-PDUs. The RLC
layer operates in unacknowledged mode as feedback links on the radio access
network are not available for point-to-multipoint bearers. Functions provided
at the RLC layer are for example segmentation and reassembly, concatenation,
padding, sequence numbering, reordering and out-of-sequence and duplication
detection. The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer maps and multiplexes the RLC-
PDUs to the transport channel and selects the transport format depending on
the instantaneous source rate. The MAC layer and physical layer appropriately
adapt the RLC-PDU to the expected transmission conditions by applying, among
others, channel coding, power and resource assignment, and modulation.
## 4.4 MBMS Bearer in E-UTRAN
The MBMS E-UTRAN Bearer service reuses most of the legacy LTE protocol stack
in the packet-switched domain. Only minor modifications are introduced to
support MBMS. The IP packets are processed in the Packet Data Convergence
Protocol (PDCP) layer where for example header compression might be applied.
In the Radio Link Control (RLC) the resulting PDCP-Protocol Data Units (PDUs),
generally of arbitrary length, are mapped to fixed length RLC-PDUs. The RLC
layer operates in unacknowledged mode as feedback links on the radio access
network are not available for point-to-multipoint bearers. Functions provided
at the RLC layer are for example segmentation and reassembly, concatenation,
padding, sequence numbering, reordering and out-of-sequence and duplication
detection. The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer maps and multiplexes the RLC-
PDUs to the transport channel and selects the transport format depending on
the instantaneous source rate. The MAC layer and physical layer appropriately
adapt the RLC-PDU to the expected transmission conditions by applying, among
others, channel coding, power and resource assignment, and modulation.
## 4.5 Streaming Delivery User Service
### 4.5.1 Introduction
The purpose of the MBMS streaming delivery method is to deliver continuous
multimedia data (i.e. speech, audio, video and DIMS) over an MBMS bearer. The
streaming delivery method is particularly useful for multicast and broadcast
of scheduled streaming content. RTP is the transport protocol for MBMS
streaming delivery. RTP provides means for sending real-time or streaming data
over UDP.
TS 26.346 defines a generic mechanism for applying Forward Error Correction to
streaming media. The mechanism consists of three components:
(i) construction of an FEC source block from the source media packets
belonging to one or several UDP packet flows related to a particular segment
of the stream(s) (in time). The UDP flows include RTP, RTCP, SRTP and MIKEY
packets.
(ii) modification of source packets to indicate the position of the source
data from the source packet within the source block
(iii) definition of repair packets, sent over UDP, which can be used by the
FEC decoder to reconstruct missing portions of the source block.
The details on transport for the streaming delivery service are provided
below.
An alternative way to deliver streaming services over MBMS is the use of DASH
and FLUTE. This is use case is discussed in section 4.7.
### 4.5.2 Transport in streaming delivery service
The MBMS streaming framework operates on RTP packets or more precisely UDP
payloads, incoming at same or different UDP ports. According to TS 26.346,
clause 8.2.2, the FEC layer for streaming delivery is based on top of the UDP
layer. The legacy RTP packets and the UDP port information are used in order
to generate FEC repair symbols. Original UDP payloads become FEC source
packets by appending a 3 byte FEC source payload ID field at the end of each
UDP payload. These packets are then UDP encapsulated and transported on the IP
multicast bearer.
According to Figure 2 a copy of these packets is forwarded to the FEC encoder
and is arranged in a source block with row width _T_ bytes at the first empty
row. The encoding symbol starts at the beginning of a new row, but it is
preceded by a 3 byte field containing the UDP flow ID (1 byte) and the length
field (2 bytes). In case the length of the packet is not an integer of the
symbol the remaining bytes in the last row are filled up with zero bytes. The
source block is filled up to _k_ rows whereby _k_ is flexible and can be
changed dynamically for each source block. The selection of _k_ depends on the
desired delay, the available terminal memory and also might depend on aspects
such as desired zapping time in mobile TV applications. Typically for a
streaming service a _protection period_ is defined and the value of the
protection period dynamically determines the source block size.
{width="5.555555555555555in" height="3.7222222222222223in"}
Figure 2: MBMS Streaming Framework
After processing all packets to be protected within one source block, the FEC
encoder generates _n_ -_k_ FEC repair symbols of size _T_ by applying FEC. The
generated FEC repair symbols can be transmitted individually or as blocks of
symbols as payload of a single UDP packet. Each FEC source and repair packet
contains sufficient information such that the receiver can correctly insert
them in the receiver source and repair block.
### 4.5.3 Examples
Examples are audio streaming applications or video streaming applications with
bitrates ranging from 32 kbit/s to one or several MBit/s. The protection
period is typically in the range of several seconds.
## 4.6 Download Delivery User Service
### 4.6.1 Introduction
According to TR 26.946, the MBMS Download Delivery Method allows the error-
free transmission of files via the unidirectional MBMS Bearer Services. The
files are \"downloaded\" and stored in the local files-system of the user
equipment. Files may contain multimedia content or any other binary data. The
MBMS Download Delivery Method allows the transmission of an arbitrary number
of files within a single data transfer phase.
{width="5.9875in" height="1.53125in"}
Figure 3: Definition of MBMS Download Sessions
Figure 3 is an example of an MBMS User Service based on the Download Delivery
Method. The file transmission events are organized in MBMS Download Sessions.
Each session is started with a File Delivery Table (FDT) instance, which
describes in this example each file within the MBMS Download Session in terms
of file name and file type (MIME Content Type). The service operator and the
actual service determine the timing of MBMS Download Sessions. Depending on
the service type, the MBMS Download session may require strict or more relaxed
time-constraint delivery of content.
### 4.6.2 Transport in download delivery service
This clause explains briefly how files are constructed for and transported
during a FLUTE session. The BM-SC takes a file, e.g. a video clip or a still
image, which is used as the transport object for FLUTE (see figure 4). The BM-
SC constructs source blocks by breaking the file into contiguous portions of
approximately equal size. Each source block is broken into source symbols. One
or more encoding symbols are carried as the payload of a FLUTE packet, thus
the FLUTE packet size be divisible by the encoding symbol size. The target
FLUTE packet size is configured by the BM-SC and, together with the file size,
is used to determine the encoding symbol length. When FEC is used it may be
beneficial to include several symbols in each FLUTE packet. Based on the
transport object size, the encoding symbol size and the maximum source block
length, FLUTE calculates the source block structure (i.e., the number of
source blocks and their length).
{width="5.34375in" height="1.726388888888889in"}
Figure 4: Constructing FLUTE packets
The BM-SC communicates the transport object size, the encoding symbol size and
the file size to the receivers within the FLUTE session transmission such that
the receiver can also calculate the source block structure in advance of
receiving a file.
The FLUTE packet is constructed from FLUTE header and payload containing one
or more encoding symbols.
The distinction between file and transport object is that the file is the
object provided to the BM-SC and played-out or stored at the MBMS UE. Within
the scope of FLUTE sessions, content encoding may be used, for instance to
compress the file with gzip for delivery. In the presence of FLUTE session
content encoding, the file and the transport object will be different binary
objects, and in the absence of content encoding the transport object will be
identical to the file. Any symbol calculations (including FEC) are performed
on transport objects.
### 4.6.3 Download Examples
In a typical use case, multimedia files typically in 3GP or MP4 format are
distributed through download delivery method. In this case the delivery rate
and the media rate may be completely different as no real-time consumption is
considered.
Table 1 shows some typical examples of file sizes for different types of
multimedia content.
Table 1: Examples for Download delivery use cases
* * *
Number File Size Example 1 50 kByte (51 200 bytes) JPEG coded logo 2 1 MByte
(1 048 576 bytes) AAC encoded audio clip 3 3 MByte (3 145 728 bytes) MP3 audio
clip 4 128 MByte (134 217 728) bytes 30 min SD movie coded at 500 kbit/s 5 1.8
GByte (1 887 436 800) bytes 2 hours HD movie coded at 2 MBit/s
* * *
## 4.7 Streaming using DASH and Download Delivery User Service
In another use case as indicated in TS 26.346, section 5.6, the download
delivery method may be used to distribute DASH formatted content over MBMS.
MBMS is designed to serve large receive groups with same content. The MBMS
Download Delivery Method is designed to deliver an arbitrary number of
(binary) files via MBMS to a large receiver population. MBMS Download defines
several methods to increase reliability such as file repair. The download
delivery method supports the delivery of media segments and even media
presentation descriptions. Media segment URIs are described using the FDT in
FLUTE.
In this case the media bit-rate and the delivery bitrate are typically the
same to maintain real-time delivery capabilities and therefore the delivery
delay of a segment is typically lower bounded by the segment duration.
Table 2 shows some typical examples of DASH media segment files for live
services. In these examples, only one representation with constant media rate
is being delivered over download delivery service.
Table 2: Examples for DASH segments

# 5 MBMS Bearer Service Channel Modelling
## 5.1 Introduction
In order to investigate the performance of application layer FEC in the
context of UTRAN and E-UTRAN, appropriate modelling of radio bearers is
necessary.
## 5.2 Modelling of UTRAN MBMS Bearer
During the initial MBMS specification phase for Release-6, appropriate
settings for UTRAN bearers for the simulation of FEC parameters had been
defined and are summarized in Table 3.
Table 3: Typical UTRAN bearer parameters
* * *
**UTRAN Bearer parameters**  
Bearer rates 64 kbit/s, 128 kbit/s, 256 kbit/s RLC PDU size 640 bytes, 1 280
bytes, 1 280 bytes respectively RLC BLER 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30% RLC block
loss pattern Independent random loss
* * *
## 5.3 Modelling of E-UTRAN MBMS Bearer
To obtain some representative numbers for the performance of an FEC code in an
LTE MBMS environment, some simple models are necessary for AL-FEC evaluation.
Figure **5** shows the mapping of RLC-SDUs to RLC-PDUs. RLC-SDUs in the
context of MBMS are IP packets. The RLC header is 1 byte if the RLC SDU
consists of 1 IP packet. The header is longer, if multiple IP packets are
multiplexed in an RLC-SDU. A reasonable assumption is to use 3 byte header of
the RLC-PDU assuming a 5 bit sequence number. The loss of one RLC-PDU results
in the loss of all IP packets included in the RLC-PDU.
The MAC PDU consists of a number of MAC SDUs, where a MAC-SDUs is an RLC-PDU.
The MAC multiplexer notifies the RLC layer of the available bits. The RLC
layer would then create an RLC PDU that fits exactly into the available space
in the MAC PDU. There is no need for fragmentation of MAC SDUs across
subframes. Based on this, it can be assumed that the loss of one MAC-PDU
results in the loss of one RLC-PDU.
{width="4.447222222222222in" height="1.6840277777777777in"}
Figure 5: Mapping of IP packets (RLC-SDUs) to RLC-PDUs (see TS 36.300, section
6.2.2)
LTE MBMS defines modulations and coding schemes with a MAC-PDU size ranging
from 680 bit to 18336 bit for a 5 MHz bandwidth.
Each MAC-PDU is mapped to a subframe. At allocation level 1, LTE MBMS can use
up to 6 out of the 10 subframes of a 10ms frame. Each subframe is 1ms.
The interleaving for MBMS in LTE is the same as for regular unicast LTE
delivery of 1 ms.
In communication with RAN1 and RAN2, it was agreed to use a two-state Markov
model for the simulation of LTE RLC-PDU losses as shown in Figure 6:.
{width="3.379166666666667in" height="1.8in"}
Figure 6: Markov model for LTE RLC-PDU losses
The model was parametrized based on the D1 simulation settings of 3GPP TR
36.942 [7] as reported in Table 4.

The simulation is carried out with a 19 sites configuration as shown in Figure
7:. Each site has 3 cells. All sites have 100% SFN operation. 30 UEs are
uniformly dropped into the center site (dark green one) in each simulation run
of 50 sec. In total 900 UEs are dropped and the SNR is sampled accordingly.
The overall SNR distribution is also shown in Figure 7:.
{width="2.779166666666667in" height="2.615972222222222in"}{width="3.59375in"
height="2.6006944444444446in"}
Figure 7: Simulation Grid and SNR distribution
Based on those SNR traces, two representative traces were selected that in
combination with MCS24 result in a 1%, 5%, 10% and 20% target BLER.
The parametrization of the Markov model is as follows:
  * each state persists for 10ms, and
  * a state is good if it has:
    * less than 10% packet loss probability for the 1% and 5% BLER simulations,
    * less than 40% packet loss probability for the 10% and 20% BLER simulations.
  * MCS=24 was used for all cases and then users at different \'MBMS > geometry\' were picked to get the different average error rate.
The parameters for Markov channel modelling are provided in Table 5.

Regarding the MCS selection, the optimum operating MCS strongly depends on the
deployment scenario, including site-to-site distance, operating frequency,
interference conditions at MBSFN area boundaries, etc. Therefore, one specific
value is not suitable. Using two different MCS cases can give some diversity
in the assumptions, hence a good approach to use the following two values:
  * higher value MCS=21 resulting in RLC-SDU size of 1332 byte.
  * lower value corresponding to 1 bit/s/Hz, with MCS=9 resulting in RLC-SDU size of 498 byte.
It is additionally from the following list of available simulation conditions
the following were selected as a good candidate representative:
  * RLC-SDU distance of 10 ms and 40ms for MCS=21
  * RLC-SDU distance of 10 ms for MCS=9
This results in total in 24 different channel configurations as summarized in
Table 8.

## 6.3 Code Performance
### 6.3.1 Introduction
For the evaluation of the code performance, two different methods are defined.
### 6.3.2 Method 1
#### 6.3.2.1 Evaluation Procedure
Data to be transmitted is partitioned into _K_ symbols. These _K_ symbols are
used to generate N total symbols to be transmitted, where _N_ >=_K_. The N
symbols are transmitted through an erasure channel with erasure probability
_P_ ~e~ (on the FEC symbol level). The erasure channel is IID and it operates
on the data symbol by symbol. The IID erasure channel is illustrated in Figure
8 and Figure 9. Successful decoding requires at least _K_ symbols to be
received, but in some cases additional received symbols may be necessary.
Denote the number of symbols _received_ in excess of _K_ to be _O_. The
decoding failure probability distribution is a function of _O_ and is given as
_P_(_O_)=Pr{decoding with _O_ overhead symbols or less fails}.
{width="4.65in" height="1.4520833333333334in"}
Figure 8: Illustration of the IID erasure channel. Data is passed through the
channel with probability 1-Pe, and erased with probability Pe.
{width="6.522916666666666in" height="1.0291666666666666in"}
Figure 9: Data is passed through the IID erasure channel, with erasure
probability of Pe. Data is delivered to the decoder in the order in which it
was transmitted.
To obtain the distribution _P_(_O_) a statistical evaluation procedure is
proposed as follows:
  1. Fix K, the number of encoded symbols
  2. Fix N, the maximum number of symbols (systematic or repair) to be transmitted
  3. Use an Erasure Channel with probability of error Pe for each symbol.
  4. Loop over 5 to 10 for N_iterations=10,000
  5. Set O= -1 and TX= -1
  6. Set RX=0
  7. While (RX \N)
        i.  Note the case as "undecodable"
    ii. Goto 5
b. TX=TX+1
c. Transmit a symbol through the Erasure Channel. If the symbol is delivered
by the Erasure Channel
        i.  RX = RX + 1
  8. Attempt to Decode with the received symbols
  9. If decoding is not successful
a. If(TX+1>N)
        i.  Note O and that the case was "undecodable"
    ii. Goto 5
b. TX = TX+1
c. Transmit a symbol through the Erasure Channel. If the symbol is delivered
by the Erasure Channel
        i.  O=O+1
d. Goto 8
  10. If decoding is successful
a. Note O
b. Goto 5
#### 6.3.2.2 Test Cases
The following test cases are determined for the purpose of evaluating the code
performance.
Table 11: Test Cases for Code Performance
* * *
Number _K_ _N_ Channel CP1 32 39 IID _P_ ~e~=5% CP2 128 154 IID _P_ ~e~=5% CP3

_P_ ~e~=10% CP9 1024 1229 IID _P_ ~e~=10% CP10 8192 9831 IID _P_ ~e~=10%
* * *
#### 6.3.2.3 Performance Metrics
For each of the above test cases the following performance metrics are
reported for N_iterations=10,000:
  * The probability that decoding is not successful with O = i symbols, P(O=i), where i=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  * The probability that decoding is not successful P(undecodable).
  * The probability that decoding is not successful with less than _O_ =0 symbols _P_ ~f~(_O=0_),
  * The necessary overhead _O*_ to achieve _P_ ~f~(_O=O*_) \ ed-pixlet.mov > data.tmp
      * create the MD5 for the file:\ cat data.tmp \| openssl md5 \| awk \'{ print \$2 }\' > ldX.md5
    * FEC encode to PCAP file as follows
      * Put FDT for the file in first packet specifying at least the following parameters
        * TOI
        * FEC-OTI
Note: Content-Location and Content-Length may not be added as they are not
necessary. Transfer-Length in the FEC-OTI is sufficient.
  * encode file into ALC/LCT packets using the test case parameters > according to Table 19 for the candidate. The end of session and > end of object transmission signalling may be used by setting the A > and B flag in the LCT header.
  * provide packets with UDP payload size according to Table 19. The ALC/LCT/UDP/IPv4 header is in total 44 bytes.
##### 6.7.3.2.2.2 Output {#output .H6}
The output from this process is, for each test case:
  * TOI and MD5 for the file. Note that the TOI and MD5 are not code specific. Note that the TOI in this case is typically 1.
  * PCAP file that contains encoded file preceded with an FDT (for details refer to TS 26.346 [3], clause 7.2.9). The PCAP file name for an example code with code name X is provided in Table 20 along with the total number of packets.

##### 6.7.3.2.3 Generate Erroneous Packet Streams
##### 6.7.3.2.3.1 LTE Traces {#lte-traces .H6}
Several LTE Error Trace are provided for each test case in the attached
package. The files are named error_trace_ld\_\.txt. The
details are summarized in Table 21.
The format of the error traces is as follows
> \[newline]
>
> _L_ x {01}
where _L_ is the maximum number of packets in ASCII that the input PCAP file
may have followed on the next line with a string of length _L_ made of ASCII
characters '0' (packet received) and '1' (packet is lost). One example would
be:
> 12
>
> 001011100100
i.e. the length of the of string of 0s and 1s is given by the integer on the
first line.
Table 21: Error traces for download test cases with losses and loss
statistics. These are accumulated.

* * *
A process for generating the error traces independently is provided in Annex
B.2.
##### 6.7.3.2.3.2 Apply to LTE traces to PCAP streams {#apply-to-lte-traces-
to-pcap-streams .H6}
In order to introduce loss into a controlled manner to the PCAP files using
the Markov error traces, a tool called pcaploss, available in source code
form, is available and attached in the package (including Makefile). This tool
takes a pcap file as input and transforms it into another altered pcap. The
usage message for pcaploss is:
> pcaploss: Usage: ./pcaploss \ \ \ [\]
where the format of the loss trace file is according to the format introduced
in section 6.7.3.3.2.1. If the optional integer argument #pkts is present,
only the number of packets indicated by #pkts will be read in from pcap_in
before pcaploss closes the output file and stops.
The pcap for transmission may be prepped with the right MAC/IP addresses for
both sender and receiver. On the sender side MAC and IP can be obtained with
command 'ipconfig/ all' on Windows, e.g.:

Note that the integration of the Ethernet and IP addresses with tcprewrite is
optional and may only be done absence of any other knowledge. tcprewrite is
included in the TCPreplay suite, for details refer to section B.6.2.
##### 6.7.3.2.3.3 Output {#output-1 .H6}

##### 6.7.3.2.5 Evaluation
##### 6.7.3.2.5.1 General {#general .H6}
After all test cases are completed the output files as presented in Table 23
are available. These files may be moved back to the host for evaluation.
##### 6.7.3.2.5.2 Correct Decoding {#correct-decoding .H6}
To verify that decoding was successful for each test case or to identify the
number of unsuccessful attempts, the result files ldY_codeX_ldZ_\.out
are collected and for each one it is compared if the TOI and MD5 are identical
with ldY.md5. If not identical, one error event is recorded.
##### 6.7.3.2.5.3 Performance Evaluation {#performance-evaluation .H6}
The output will then be extracted from the two files which include the output
from the time command similar as seen below:

The relevant entries here are \"system time\", \"user time\" (the sum of which
is to be reported as the processing cost), and \"Maximum resident set size\".
The memory usage to be reported is 1/4 of that given as the \"Maximum resident
set size\" in an unpatched busybox 1.19.0. The reason for this division by 4
is that busybox has a bug which causes it to overestimate memory usage by a
factor of 4, just like the GNU time utility from which it is presumably
inheriting this mistake. See the bug report [here]{.underline} (see note).
NOTE: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2008-12/msg00047.html
The following performance data measurement is proposed:
  * Generate the numbers from above for the considered test case
  * Generate the numbers from above for a zero loss trace
  * Report the following numbers for each test case and the zero loss trace:
    * _U_ : User time (seconds)
    * _S_ : System time (seconds)
    * _P_ : Percent of CPU this job got
    * _W_ : Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss):
    * _M_ : Maximum resident set size (kbytes)
  * Generate the following numbers for performance evaluation based on the above results and the object size _F_ (in bytes) for each test case and trace number:
    * Speed: Average decoding speed (in MBit/s): _F*8_ /(1000000*(_U_ +_S_))
    * Time1: Decoding time (in s): _U_ +_S_
    * Time2: weighted elapsed time (in s): _P_ *_W_ /100
    * Memory: Peak memory usage (in MBytes): _M_ /4096
##### 6.7.3.2.5.4 Performance Documentation {#performance-documentation .H6}
The following values are to be reported for each test case be using the
results from each **trno** = 0, ..., _S_ -1 and the error free decoding:
  * _Np_ the total number of packets used for decoding
  * _E_ the total number of file delivery attempts that failed (should be 0)
  * AvSpeed the average speed over all _S_ decoding attempts
  * AvTime1 the average decode time over all _S_ decoding attempts
  * AvTime2 the weighted elapsed time over all _S_ decoding attempts
  * MinSpeed the minimum speed over all _S_ decoding attempts
  * MaxTime1 the maximum decoding over all _S_ decoding attempts
  * MaxTime2 the weighted elapsed time over all _S_ decoding attempts
  * MaxMem the maximum memory over all _S_ decoding attempts
  * AvCPU the average value of _P_ over all _S_ decoding attempts
  * EfSpeed the speed for error-free decoding attempt
  * EfTime1 the Time for error-free decoding attempt
  * EfTime2 the Time for error-free decoding attempt
  * EfMem the Memory for error-free decoding attempt
Note that
  * the error-free results are not required, but recommended to be provided.
  * the data are obviously expected to be provided for the network2sd (in Table 25) and ld_decoder process (in Table 24).
  * The test cases LD60_110, LD118_108 and LD119_109 are optional

##### 6.7.3.3.2 Generate FLUTE Packet Test Streams
##### 6.7.3.3.2.1 Process {#process-2 .H6}
In order to generate the FLUTE Packet Test streams, the following actions are
to be applied on the host
  * Download the following file http://media.xiph.org/ED/ed-pixlet.mov
  * for each test case LSX according to Table 26
    * generate segments and MD5
      * split the file in to Y segments, each of size S
      * create the MD5 for each of the segments and create a file that lists the TOI and the MD5
      * the shell script in section 0 can be used for this purpose. It creates as output the segment number as well as the MD5 for the segment
    * FEC encode to PCAP file as follows:
      * Provide FDT for each segment just before first packet of a segment specifying at least the following parameters
        * TOI
        * FEC-OTI
> Note:
  * Content-Location and Content-Length are not added as they are not necessary. Transfer Encoding is sufficient.
```{=html}
``` \- encode each segment sequentially with increasing TOI numbers _1_ > ...
_Y_ into ALC/LCT packets using the test case parameters > according to Table
26 for the candidate
```{=html}
``` \- number of source symbols K,
  * number of transmitted symbols N,
  * symbol size T,
```{=html}
``` \- sub-blocking parameters if needed
> Note: End of session and end of object transmission signalling may be used
> by setting the A and B flag in the LCT header.
  * for all ALC/LCT packets with TOI not equal to 0,
    * provide packets with UDP payload size according to Table 26. The ALC/LCT/UDP/IPv4 header is in total 44 bytes.
    * If in doubt or unclear what to use, include the timing for the real-time bitrate, i.e. 1 packet every according to the packet interval in Table 26. Note that the tool pcaploss rewrites correctly the packet timestamps with the right transmission time interval.
  * for all ALC/LCT packets with TOI equal to 0, i.e. FDT packets
    * provide packets with UDP payload size according to Table 26. The ALC/LCT/UDP/IPv4 header is in total 44 bytes.
    * If in doubt or unclear what to use, include a timing that is 50% of the packet interval in Table 26 earlier than the one in the first packet of the object with the TOI included in this FDT. Note that the tool pcaploss rewrites correctly the packet timestamps with the right transmission time interval.
##### 6.7.3.3.2.2 Output {#output-3 .H6}
The output from this process is for each test case:
  * File that contains TOI and MD5 for each of the segments
  * PCAP file that contains a sequence of segments prefixed with a single multi-packet FDT that summarizes the entire sequence. The PCAP file name for a code with code name X is provided in Table 27 along with the total number of packets

A process for generating the error traces independently is provided in Annex
B.
##### 6.7.3.3.3.2 Apply to LTE traces to PCAP streams {#apply-to-lte-traces-
to-pcap-streams-1 .H6}
In order to introduce loss into a controlled manner to the PCAP files using
the Markov error traces, a tool called pcaploss, available in source code
form, is available and attached in the package (including Makefile). This tool
takes a pcap file as input and transforms it into another altered pcap. The
usage message for pcaploss is:
> pcaploss: Usage: ./pcaploss \ \ \ [\]
where the format of the loss trace file is according to the format introduced
in clause 6.7.3.3.2.1. If the optional integer argument #pkts is present, only
the number of packets indicated by #pkts will be read in from pcap_in before
pcaploss closes the output file and stops.
The pcap for transmission may be prepped with the right MAC/IP addresses for
both sender and receiver. On the sender side MAC and IP can be obtained with
command 'ipconfig/ all' on Windows, e.g.:

Note that the integration of the Ethernet and IP addresses with tcprewrite is
optional and may only be done absence of any other knowledge. tcprewrite is
included in the TCPreplay suite, for details refer to Annex B.6.2.
##### 6.7.3.3.3.3 Output {#output-4 .H6}

  * Device:
    * Samsung Galaxy S2â„¢ (GT-I9100) Smartphone, running Android 4.0.3. The processor is a Dual-core Exynos 4210 1.2GHz processor ARM Cortex-A9.
    * Root access is applied to the device, for details see Annex B.3.
    * ls_decoder executable for FEC decoding available on the device, for details on functionalities, see clause 6.7.3.3.3.2.
    * verifysegm for generating the md5 or a received segment push the data to stdout with TOI and length. For details on functionalities, see Annex B.8.
    * push the Unix \'time\' command on the device, for details see Annex B.4.
```{=html}
``` \- The host PC:
    -   can be any OS, but typically Windows or Linux
    -   The host PC is connected to the Device using USB tethering
        through an interface. It is assumed that the interface has
        assigned name Samsung.
    -   the host does have a functionality installed that permits to
        push the stored PCAP files to the device. For details, see Annex
        B.6. In the following it is assumed that ColaSoft Packet Player
        is available.
  * The details of connecting device and host PC are provided in Annex B.5.
##### 6.7.3.3.4.2 Decoder {#decoder .H6}
The ls_ecoder executable receives its input data via the network interface
card (UDP/ALC/LCT packets) and writes on stdout decoded source block.
If correction of the segment is successful, this application writes on stdout:
> [ TOI (32-bit) \| length (32-bit) \| \]
where TOI is the segment Transport Object Identifier followed by the length of
the decoded segment in bytes and the actual recovered segment data. TOI and
length are in network-byte order.
Note that the proponent need not use the provided verifysegm, but provide its
own verification program. In this case the interface between the decoder and
the verification program may for example use the segment name instead of the
TOI.
##### 6.7.3.3.4.3 Process {#process-3 .H6}
For each test case LSX from Table 26, the following processes are carried out

The relevant entries here are system time, user time (the sum of which is to
be reported as the processing cost), and Maximum resident set size. The memory
usage to be reported is 1/4 of that given as the Maximum resident set size in
an unpatched busybox 1.19.0. The reason for this division by 4 is that busybox
has a bug which causes it to overestimate memory usage by a factor of 4, just
like the GNU time utility from which it is presumably inheriting this mistake.
See the bug report [here]{.underline} (see note).
NOTE: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2008-12/msg00047.htm
The following performance data measurement is proposed:
  * Generate the numbers from above for the considered test case
  * Generate the numbers from above for a zero loss trace
  * Report the following numbers for each test case and the zero loss trace:
    * _U_ : User time (seconds)
    * _S_ : System time (seconds)
    * _P_ : Percent of CPU this job got
    * _W_ : Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss):
    * _M_ : Maximum resident set size (kbytes)
  * Generate the following numbers for performance evaluation based on the above results and the segment duration _D_ (in seconds), the media bitrate _R_ (in kBit/s), and the duration of the media data _t_ (in seconds):
    * Speed: Average decoding speed (in MBit/s): _R_ *_t_ /(1000*(_U_ +_S_))
    * Latency: Average decoding latency (in ms): _D_ *(1000*(_U_ +_S_))/_t_
    * Memory: Peak memory usage (in MBytes): _M_ /4096

# 9 Other FEC Enhancements
## 9.1 Introduction
During the work item on EMM-EFEC other technologies beyond pure codes were
submitted. The technologies are documented in this clause.
## 9.2 Graceful Degradation (GD) - FEC
### 9.2.1 Introduction
Graceful Degradation (GD)-FEC sub-layer is performed at the first process in
Transport layer and directly applied for the received data from the Media
layer. GD-FEC mechanism provides unequal error protection (UEP) technique that
protects important parts of media bit stream(s) more strongly than others. FEC
layer is located in the lower and at the RTP/RCTP or SRTP sections to fully
protect the packets and headers generated in the upper sub-layers. GD-FEC sub-
layer may also be located in above FLUTE protocol layer when it used for DASH-
based streaming service over FLUTE.
### 9.2.2 GD-FEC Operations and Requirements
When a system needs to supply a certain level of service quality for radio
impaired mobiles that are suffered frequent burst losses in broadcasting, it
may adopt GD-FEC and in this case, the system should inform all mobiles about
the following information using in-band and/or out-band signalling:
\- The kind of media data that is be protected by GD-FEC (e.g. audio, text,
...)
\- The location of GD-FEC source and repair packets in the source flows
\- The GD-FEC format and encoded method
The portion of the source data protected by GD-FEC (referred to as target
source) should be relatively small (e.g. audio data can be chosen for the
target source, because the size of audio data is typically below 10% of that
of video data) so that the required amount of repair packets can be small.
With an enough amount of repair data, GD-FEC may provide a media protection
with a low burden in computational complexity.
In GD-FEC, the encoding delay introduced by the GD-FEC encoder may increase,
but may still be good enough for typical media coding systems. However, for
receivers ignoring the GD-FEC system should not add additional decoding delay.
Next section describes an example of GD-FEC implementation which fulfils these
requirements.
In fact, GD-FEC can be flexibly adopted as: Good receiving status mobiles can
be configured to not use GD-FEC decoding, however, bad receiving status
mobiles may use GD-FEC repair packets when GD-FEC is deployed in media systems
at the expense of possibly increased delay.
### 9.2.3 GD-FEC Encoding/Decoding Examples
This section describes an example of GD-FEC implementation which fulfils the
requirements described in previous section. In this example, the audio packets
are selected as the target source data for GD-FEC protection.
There are two important terminologies for GD-FEC: Encoded multimedia data
group (EMDG) and GD-FEC encoding group (GDEG) as shown in figure 11\. EMDG is
a packet group that contains a group of media data providing a certain amount
of information (e.g. all media data in one picture frame unit). GDEG is
defined as a group of L EMDGs where L=1, 2, ... (e.g. L=4 in figure 11).
{width="6.503472222222222in" height="2.625in"}
Figure 11: Encoded Multimedia Data Group (EMDG) and GD-FEC Encoding Group
(GDEG)
It should be noted that, an important requirement for the GD-FEC described in
previous section is the decoding delay of GD-FEC. Figure 12 shows none or
minimum delay for the GD-FEC decoding whereas enough delay is yielded in the
GD-FEC encoding (in the case of _L_ =4).
{width="6.445833333333334in" height="4.35in"}
Figure 12: None or Minimum Delay GD-FEC Decoding Whereas Enough Delay Yielded\
by GD-FEC Encoding (e.g. L=4)
Another example of the low latency GD-FEC scheme is shown in Figure 13. In the
figure, the duration of a GD-FEC encoding group is the same as that required
to process a FLUTE segment file. With this alignment, an additional processing
delay for the GD-FEC encoding is not required because it can be performed in
the time slot of the FLUTE segment file process. Using the same reasoning, an
additional processing delay for the GD-FEC decoding is also not required. The
FLUTE segment packet units are smaller units than FLUTE file segments.
Interleaving can be performed with these FLUTE segment packet units (e.g.
predetermined random order sending). In the total streaming file for the
FLUTE, the source data packets have headers and these headers are more
important than others; furthermore, they can be GD-FEC target sources for
stronger protection (e.g. UEP for the headers).
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="2.4125in"}
Figure 13: GD-FEC encoding delay aligned with the FLUTE segment file
processing delay (e.g. the duration of the FLUTE file segment equals that of
the GD-FEC encoding group)
### 9.2.4 Conclusion on GD-FEC
Although the study of GD-FEC during the EMM-EFEC work item produced results
that showed positive benefits in some use cases and environments, it was
considered that this technology could not be adopted within a normative
specification at this time. Further consideration of GD-FEC may be made during
later releases as a solution to various use cases including, but not limited
to:
\- Small segment delivery over FLUTE
\- Low latency for good covered mobiles and increased latency for UEs in worse
coverage
\- Fast start-up
\- OTA (over the air overheads)
# 10 Conclusions
There were significant investigations into the capabilities, performance and
suitability of the qualifying EMM-EFEC candidates. The attached results and
verification documents present a full view of the work performed in this area.
6330 and RS+LDPC each received significant support as MBMS Application Layer
FEC (AL-FEC).
As a final conclusion of the work, no new AL-FEC code was adopted.
The existing FEC provides sufficient features and performance to ensure
successful operation of MBMS User Services.
###### ### Annex A: Simulation Conditions
# A.1 Simulation Procedure for download delivery
For file downloads simulations the following assumptions are made:
\- All source blocks have the same size, i.e. the size the largest source
blocks (this would slightly overestimate FEC overhead but simplifies
simulation code)
\- The working size memory is 256KB for UTRAN MBMS and 1MB for LTE MBMS
The download procedure is:
  * Generate IP packet loss transcripts, one per user, with mapping algorithm according to the access technology and the IP packet size according to the table. The transcript length has to be long enough to cover transmission of the biggest file subject to maximum simulated loss and transmission overhead to meet target success rate.
  * Using the following as input: file size F, payload size P, receiver memory size WS. Then compute the number of source blocks Z and their size in symbols KT, the number of symbols per packet G (always 1 for Ideal) according to the following schemes per FEC:
> \- In the case of Ideal code, there is always a single source block with
> symbol size T=P with a total of K=ceil(F/P) symbols.
>
> \- In the case of Raptor, the parameters are computed using Section 9.1
> Block Partitioning Algorithm of RFC 5052.
>
> \- In case of other codes, the algorithm for computing the different
> parameters should be provided
  * For each user U do
    * Encoding symbol index I = 0
    * Until all Z source block are received
      * For each Z source block
        1. Add a received symbol of ESI I for the block if not lost according to lost transcript A for user
        2. Move loss transcript pointer to next item
        3. If the block is not decoded and number of received symbols is equal or bigger than K*T do:
           * Try decoding with the set of received ESIs
           * If successful, mark block as decoded, record number of symbols necessary for this block
      * I = I + 1
    * Find maximum of necessary symbols maxSymbol across Z blocks for user U, report Transmission overhead as (maxSymbol*T *Z/ F) in percent
  * Rank all users according to their Transmission overhead
  * If X is the target success rate, keep the last (1 -- X) * N last users where N is the number of simulated users
  * Report Transmission overhead (reported as FEC overhead in TR26.346) of the first user (i.e. with lowest FEC overhead) from remaining users of step 5.
# A.2 Simulation Procedure for streaming delivery
**The streaming simulation procedure is:**
  * Select a streaming service with source data rate and stream duration (24 hours)
  * Generate IP packet loss transcripts, one per user, with mapping algorithm according to the access technology and the IP packet size according to the table. The transcript length has to be long enough to cover transmission of the whole stream duration.
  * Compute number of symbols N per protection period for FEC under consideration (for RFC5053, this is the number of packets if G > 1)
  * R = 0, the number of repair symbols
  * Loop 1: Until number of segment in error E is less than target error maxE do:
    * K = N -- R, where K = number of symbols for block
    * For all segments in stream do:
      * For ESI = 0 up to N-1 do:
        * If SDU is received according to loss transcript A, record ESI as received
      * Try decoding with set of received ESI
      * If not successful, E = E + 1
      * If E > maxE, R = R + 1, restart Loop 1
  * Record last value of K as maxK
  * Report maximum streaming rate as (G*K*T*8 / protection period ) where T is the symbol size.

Table B.2 provides the instructions how to generate the error traces for the
download test cases. The \ corresponds to the Length in the table and
the \ is the trace number minus one multiplied by the length. The trno
runs from 1 to S.

# B.3 Root access for Galaxy S2
Here is procedure to root the Samsung S2:
  * http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1501719
Once the phone is rooted, to turn on performance mode and disable the second
CPU core:
  * cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq
  * cat scaling_governor
    * this will tell the current mode (on-demand or performance)
  * echo performance > scaling_governor
    * turn on performance mode.  _echo ondemand to turn off_
    * NOT a sticky command i.e. value resets to ondemand after reset
      * note:  _performance_ mode will keep it at 1.5GHz, even at idle
      * In  _ondemand_ mode - at idle, without a data transfer or anything else running on the device, cpu0 should be running at much lower speed
  * cat scaling_cur_freq
    * display current clock frequency in kHz
  * cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq
    * to check the settings for cpu1
      * NOTE: if core 1 is not on, the cpufreq directory won\'t exist
  * cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1; cat online
    * if it outputs 1, cpu1 is still up
  * echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
    * shuts a given cpu down
  * chmod 444 /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
    * ensures that the cpu is not restarted again (needs to be finally verified)
# B.4 Time Command on Android Device
To enable the time command on an android device, the Busybox needs to be
installed.
\- ARM pre-compiled busybox can be downloaded from
http://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.19.0/ (the ARMv6l works well on
Android).
\- Then push it on the phone by
\- renaming it \'time\': adb push busybox-armv6l /data/local/tmp/time
\- make sure it\'s executable (adb shell chmod 0777 /data/local/tmp/time).
# B.5 USB tethering of Android Devices
## B.5.1 Requirements
Android device running 2.2 Froyo or higher
## B.5.2 Enable USB tethering on Android
\- Switch ON \"Tethering\" option in \"Setting->Wireless and Networks.
You can check the IP address of the newly created interface using the \"adb\"
tool from the Android SDK. Once in the Android shell use the \"netcfg\"
command. The IP address should be \"192.168.42.129\" (Hardcoded in Android
source code).

# B.6 Play a PCAP
## B.6.1 Windows
In order to play a PCAP file on a Windows based host, one can use the
following tools:
  * http://www.colasoft.com/packet_player/
## B.6.2 Unix & Win32/Cygwin
In order to play a pcap file on a Unix based host, one can use the following
tools:
  * TCP Replay as available here: http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/
  * or here as source http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpreplay/
# B.7 Android SSH server
An SSH server for Android is SSHDroid available from Google Marketplace.
Search for 'SSHDroid'. Once installed, make sure to configure port 2222 in its
settings. For some reason when SSHDroid defaults to port 22 when running in
root mode, it is not possible to ssh in. Port 2222 has no such restriction.
# B.8 Verify Segment Decoding
This tool is attached in source code in verifysegm.zip with compilation
instructions for Android.
The tool reads from stdin a repeated sequence
> [ TOI (32-bit) \| length (32-bit) \| \]
where TOI is the segment Transport Object Identifier followed by the length of
the decoded segment in bytes and the actual recovered segment data. TOI and
length are in network-byte order.
For each such triplet, the output is
> \ \ \
> \
The output is human readable, unlike the input. Exactly one such line is
printed to stdout per TOI (assuming the TOI is received a single time).
Example input in hex:
> 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 03 a0 a1 a2 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 01 b0
>
> (end of file after that.)
This corresponds to two objects, first having TOI 1, and a length of 3 bytes,
the file content being (in hex) a0 a1 a2, and the second one being TOI 1 the
file containing a single byte b0.
The output produced by that should be:
> 1 b33326d4c1d789e9651d526f420b6801
>
> 2 ec655b6da8b9264a7c7c5e1a70642fa7
and no other line.
