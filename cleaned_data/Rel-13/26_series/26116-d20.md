# Introduction
Linear TV services can be made available on 3GPP services based on MBMS and
PSS user services (over RTP or 3GP-DASH).
\- 3GP-DASH aims at offering the best quality of experience as possible by
adapting to the UE capabilities and dynamically to the network conditions.
Linear TV and on-demand services are already identified as major use cases for
3GP-DASH delivery format.
\- (e)MBMS user services offer the possibility to offload the network when the
same content is consumed simultaneously by many UEs. This typically happens
when a large audience accesses the same content concurrently, such as a
popular football match, the Olympic Games, a political debate, breaking news,
etc. For this reason, the access to live broadcast TV services is a major use
case for eMBMS.
For traditional linear TV distribution, TV services accessed through
Satellite, Digital Terrestrial TV (DTT), cable or IPTV obey to requirements on
the video profiles to ensure a consistent quality of experience while
accessing different channels within a TV bouquet.
On-demand video services, via streaming or downloading, generally obey to the
same requirements.
In previous releases, 3GPP specifications were missing detailed definitions of
consistent video distribution formats (such as spatial and temporal
resolutions, aspect ratios, random access points, etc.) for which operators
can provide such guarantees in terms of quality of experience. The purpose of
the present document is to specify those distribution formats.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies requirements and guidelines on video source
formats (frame rate, resolution, aspect ratio, colorimetry, bit depth...) and
encoding parameters (codec format, random access point period, SEI
messages...) for different types of TV services, including linear TV, catch-up
TV or on-demand services. A limited set of Operation Points (e.g. SDTV,
HDTV...) are defined to provide confidence to content providers/broadcasters
on the quality of experience offered by 3GPP services when used for TV-like
distribution. Operation Points define format and encoding restrictions, but
may also be viewed as compatibility points for UEs.
In particular, the Operation Points defined in the present document may serve
as the primary tested configurations for TV centric video distribution. The
initial set of Operation Points are defined based on the analysis and findings
in the technical report TR 26.949 [2].
In addition, in the context of DASH operations, not only the main distribution
format are defined, but also a subset of spatial and temporal resolutions. In
order to minimize testing for seamless switching experience, suitable lower
resolutions of distribution formats are defined. Furthermore, to compensate
congestion situations, a minimum service quality is defined in order to
provide service continuity.

## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**Bitstream:** A media bitstream that conforms to a video encoding format and
certain Operation Point.
**Operation Point:** A collection of discrete combinations of different
content formats including spatial and temporal resolutions, colour mapping,
transfer functions, etc. and the encoding format.
**Pillarbox:** The pillarbox effect occurs in widescreen video displays when
black bars (mattes or masking) are placed on the sides of the image. It
becomes necessary when film or video that was not originally designed for
widescreen is shown on a widescreen display, or a narrower widescreen image is
displayed within a wider aspect ratio.

# 4 Video profiles Operation Points
## 4.1 Introduction
The video profile Operation Points defined in this clause are primarily
defined in order to apply to the content format being delivered to 3GPP UE
PSS/DASH and MBMS clients over the 3GPP system. Parameters for video
encoder/decoder, content format and transport are defined.
The following Operation Points are defined in the present document: H.264/AVC
720p HD, H.264/AVC Full HD, H.265/HEVC 720p HD, H.265/HEVC Full HD, and
H.265/HEVC UHD.
Clause 4.2 specifies general requirements applicable to all Operation Points.
Clause 4.3 specifies general requirements applicable to the video codecs. Then
for each Operation Point, Bitstream and Receiver requirements are detailed in
clause 4.4 for H.264/AVC and clause 4.5 for H.265/HEVC.
## 4.2 General requirements on video profile Operation Points
The following requirements apply to video profile Operation Points:
\- 16:9 picture aspect ratio shall be used. 3GPP UEs with display aspect ratio
different from 16:9 and supporting the TV services over 3GPP are, by default,
assumed to display the video in letter-box or pillarbox modes, depending on
the screen size and orientation.
\- Y\'CbCr (non-constant luminance) as the Chroma Format should be used.
\- 4:2:0 chroma sub-sampling shall be used.
\- The following spatial resolutions should be used for:
\- Operation Points (for video intended to be viewed in full-screen mode):
3840 × 2160, 1920 × 1080 and 1280 × 720.
\- Distribution formats: 3840 × 2160, 3200 × 1800, 2560 × 1440, 1920 × 1080,
1600 × 900, 1280 × 720, 960 × 540, 854 × 480, 640 × 360, 426 × 240.
NOTE 1: Distribution formats within an Operation Point do not exceed the
native resolution of the Operation Point, but they may be subsampled in order
to optimize distribution or adapt to the viewing conditions.
\- The following frame rates should be used depending on the Operation Point:
24; 25; 30; 50 and 60Hz. The following fractional frame rates may be used:
24/1.001, 30/1.001, 60/1.001 (Hz). Frame rates are not associated to any
particular spatial resolution.
> \- The following colour space formats may be used depending on the Operation
> Point: ITU-R BT.709 [3] and ITU-R BT.2020 [4]. If no signal is provided for
> the colour space, BT.709 [3] should be assumed as default colour space.
> Receiving devices should support BT.2020 [4] signaling and provide an
> appropriate mapping of the signal to the supported colour space of the
> device. Colour spaces are not associated to any particular spatial
> resolution.
NOTE 2: Although ITU-R BT.2020 is originally only recommended for 2160p/4320p
resolution, this 3GPP specification recommends that BT.2020 be supported
irrespective of the resolution to keep the colour space consistent across
resolutions.
\- The Random Access Point period shall be less than or equal to 5 seconds,
should be less than or equal to 2 seconds and may be less than or equal to 0.5
second for H.264/AVC [5] and 1 second for H.265/HEVC [6] for specific service
requirements such as fast channel change or fast access to the bitstream.
\- Bit depth: Either 8 or 10 bits shall be used depending on the Operation
Point.
Table 4.1 provides an overview of the Operation Points defined in the present
document.
