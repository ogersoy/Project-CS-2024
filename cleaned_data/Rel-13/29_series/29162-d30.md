# 4 General
## 4.1 General interworking overview
The IM CN Subsystem interworks with SIP (IETF RFC 3261 [2]) based IP
Multimedia networks. These IP Multimedia networks include:
\- SIP User Agents (SIP UAs); and
\- SIP Servers.
As such, the IM CN Subsystem has to be able to interwork to all of these above
functional entities in the IP multimedia network, as there is a possibility
that they all may be involved in an IM session. The general interworking model
is shown in figure 1. The SIP based Multimedia networks may use IP version 4
(IETF RFC 791 [9]) or IP version 6 (IETF RFC 2460 [10]).
Figure 1: Interworking Model for IM CN Subsystem to IP Multimedia Network
The PS UE uses the CSCF in order to communicate with the external IP
multimedia network entities.
The CS UE uses a MSC Server to communicate with external IP multimedia network
entities.
If no IP version interworking or no NAT/NAPT between different realms is
required, the CSCF and the MSC Server can communicate with SIP UAs in an
external IP multimedia network directly.
If no IP version interworking or no NAT/NAPT between different realms is
required, the CSCF and the MSC Server can also communicate with SIP proxies in
an external IP multimedia network directly, which in turn can then communicate
with SIP UAs.
To provide the IP version interworking or NAT/NAPT between different realms
the functions of an IMS-ALG and a TrGW may be inserted between the CSCF or the
MSC Server and the external IP Multimedia Network by configuration. The IMS-
ALG and the TrGW may be implemented as a part of other physical entities in
the IMS.
NOTE: Other methods to provide IP version interworking are outside the scope
of this release.
## 4.2 Interworking scenarios
3GPP specifications design the IM CN subsystem elements and interfaces to
exclusively support IPv6. 3GPP TS 23.221 [3] details the interoperability
scenarios that an UE may experience when interworking with an external PDN.
All of these IP transport layer interworking scenarios can apply to the
application layer interworking scenarios detailed in subclause 4.2.1.
### 4.2.1 UE with 3GPP SIP profile capability connecting to an external SIP
device
The procedures used by an UE with 3GPP SIP profile to connect to an external
SIP device, which may lack 3GPP SIP profile capabilities, have been analysed
in Release 6 within 3GPP TR 29.962 [13] and are specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[1].
# 5 Network characteristics
## 5.1 Key characteristics of IP Multimedia Networks
The Internet is a conglomeration of networks utilising a common set of
protocols. IP protocols are defined in the relevant IETF RFCs. The networks
topologies may be based on LANs (e.g. Ethernet), Point-to-Point leased lines,
PSTN, ISDN, X.25 or WANs using switched technology (e.g. SMDS, ATM).
IP multimedia networks provide the ability for users to invoke IP multimedia
applications in order to send and receive (where applicable) voice and data
communications. One protocol used to manage IP multimedia sessions is the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (IETF RFC 3261 [2]).
## 5.2 Key characteristics of UMTS IM CN Subsystem
The UMTS IM CN subsystem uses the SIP protocol to manage IP multimedia
sessions, and uses IP as the transport mechanism for both SIP session
signalling and media transport.
The UMTS IM CN subsystem shall support interworking with existing fixed and
mobile voice and IP data networks, including PSTN, ISDN, Mobile and Internet.
# 6 Interworking Reference Model for control plane interworking and user plane
interworking
## 6.0 Reference Model
Figure 2 details the reference architecture required to support interworking
between the IM CN subsystem and IP networks for IM services. Figure 3 details
the reference architecture required to support interworking between the IMS
and IP SIP networks supporting IP version 4.
NOTE: Multimedia IP networks may be connected via the Mb interface to various
network entities, such as an UE (via an GTP Tunnel reaching to the GGSN), an
MRFP, or an application server.
Figure 2: IM CN Subsystem to IP network interworking reference Architecture
without IP version interworking
Figure 3: Border Control Functions
**Mm reference point:** The call control protocol applied to the Mm interface
between CSCF and external IP networks is SIP, IETF RFC 3261 [2], as detailed
in 3GPP TS 24.229 [1]. SIP extension packages mandated by 3GPP are possibly
not supported.
**Mb reference point:** This interface is defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [5] and is
IP based. Further information is provided in 3GPP TS 29.061 [4] and 3GPP TS
26.114 [36].
**Mx reference point:** The protocol applied at the Mx reference point is
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [1].
**Ix reference point:** The protocol applied at the Ix reference point is
specified in 3GPP TS 29.238 [25].
## 6.1 Interworking Functional Entities
### 6.1.1 IBCF
This entity provides control plane functionality to connect entities following
the 3GPP profile of SIP, 3GPP TS 24.229 [1], and external SIP entities
following IETF RFC 3261 [2].
### 6.1.2 IMS-ALG
IMS-ALG functionality resides in IBCF. An IMS-ALG provides the application
level translation function for SIP and SDP in order to communicate between
IPv6 and IPv4 SIP applications or, based on operator policies between
different realms using the same IP version. The IBCF acts as a SIP B2BUA when
IBCF performs IMS-ALG functionality.
### 6.1.3 TrGW
The TrGW is a NAT-PT/NAPT-PT, which uses a pool of globally unique IPv4
addresses for assignment to IPv6 nodes on a dynamic basis as sessions are
initiated across the IP version boundaries. NAT-PT binds addresses in IPv6
network with addresses in IPv4 network and vice versa to provide transparent
routing between the two IP domain without requiring any changes to end points.
NAPT-PT provides additional translation of transport identifier (TCP, SCTP and
UDP port numbers). More detailed information on the NAT-PT/NAPT-PT is given in
IETF RFC 2766 [11] and IETF RFC 2663 [12].
The TrGW may provide the NAT/NAPT functionality between two disparate address
realms.
### 6.1.4 Acces Transfer Control Function
The ATCF may reside within the IBCF to support \"SRVCC enhanced with ATCF\"
procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [41] and 3GPP TS 24.237 [42] . In
this case, the Ix reference point is used for IMS sessions that the ATCF
decides to anchor at the ATGW to provide the following functions:
\- reservation and configuration of ATGW resources for media anchoring during
PS session origination or termination;
\- reconfiguration of ATGW resources during access transfer to the CS domain;
\- release of ATGW resources upon completion of the access transfer or release
of the session;
\- media transcoding if the media that was used prior to the access transfer
is not supported by the MSC server;
\- IP version interworking if different IP versions are used between the
access and the remote legs; and
\- indication of IP realm during allocation of transport addresses/resources
(the PS and CS accesses may be reachable via different IP realms).
### 6.1.5 Acces Transfer GateWay
The ATGW may reside within the TrGW to support \"SRVCC enhanced with ATCF\"
procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [41] and 3GPP TS 24.237 [42]. If the
IBCF supports the ATCF functionality (see subclause 6.1.4), the IBCF shall
select a TRGW which supports the ATGW functionality.
# 7 Control plane interworking
## 7.1 SIP with 3GPP Profile to Standard SIP Interworking
3GPP TS 24.229 [1] defines the procedures, which allow a 3GPP-IMS UE to
connect to a standard SIP terminal.
## 7.2 Additional interworking of protocols associated with services
There is no impact beyond that specified in subclause 7.1 provided the
necessary SIP extensions are supported on both sides of the interworking
point.
Based on operator policy and/or service level agreements the interworking of
services may be restricted.
Additional information related to interworking with services is provided in
3GPP TS 29.165 [40].
# 8 User Plane Interworking
## 8.1 Overview
The present specification addresses user plane interworking between codec
types used for either speech or video. Codecs used for conversational services
in the PS domain are as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36].
## 8.2 Void
## 8.3 Void
# 9 IMS-ALG and TrGW functionality for NAPT and IP Version Interworking
## 9.1 Control plane interworking
### 9.1.1 Session Set-up
#### 9.1.1.0 General
The procedure described in subclause 9.1.1 applies both for an SDP offer
received from the external network and received from the IMS.
If different IP versions are used in the external network and the IMS, the
TrGW shall provide IP version interworking of the user plane. Otherwise, the
TrGW provides NAPT functionality.
#### 9.1.1.1 Receipt of the first SDP offer
At the receipt of the first SDP offer from an offering network A the IMS-ALG
shall:
\- Request the TrGW to allocate a termination towards an answering network B
and provide IP address(es) and port number(s) from its pool for this
termination.
When the IMS-ALG has received the requested information from the TrGW, the
IMS-ALG shall include the address(es) and port number(s) in a new offer, and
sent this offer toward the network B. The IMS-ALG shall create a SIP message
in accordance with the rules for the IMS-ALG described in subclause 9.1.4 with
the following clarification:
\- The IP address(es) and port number(s) received from the TrGW for the
termination towards network B shall replace the IP address(es) and port
number(s) in the SDP.
#### 9.1.1.2 Receipt of the first SDP answer
At the receipt of the first SDP answer from network B the IMS-ALG shall:
\- Provide to the TrGW the address(es) and port number(s) as received in the
c-line(s) and m-line(s) in the SDP answer as destinations for the termination
towards answering network B;
\- Request the TrGW to allocate a termination towards the offering network A
and provide IP address(es) and port number(s) from its pool for this
termination, and provide the IP address and port number received in the first
SDP offer from network A as destination for this termination, unless this step
has already been executed earlier, e.g. at the receipt of the SDP offer; and
\- Requests the TrGW to bind the termination towards network A and the the
termination towards network B to enable the routing of user plane traffic
towards the IPv4 SIP network through the TrGW.
NOTE: The binding request will be combined with the request to create
terminations in the H.248 protocol
When the IMS-ALG has received the requested information, the IMS-ALG shall
send an SDP answer to the network A. The IMS-ALG shall create the SIP message
in accordance with the rules for the IMS-ALG described in subclause 9.1.4 with
the following clarification:
\- The IP address(es) and port number(s) received from the TrGW for the
termination towards network A shall replace the received IP address(es) and
port number(s) in the SDP.
### 9.1.2 Void
### 9.1.3 Change of connection information
After the dialog is established it is possible for both ends of the session to
change the connection data for the session. When the IMS-ALG/TrGW receives a
SDP offer/answer where port number(s) or IP address(es) is included., there
are four different possibilities:
1) IP address(es) or/and port number(s) have been added. In this case
additional binding(s) shall be provided by the IMS-ALG/TrGW as detailed for
the first SDP offer in the subclauses above;
2) IP address(es) or/and port number(s) have been deleted. In this case
binding(s) shall be made free by the IMS-ALG/TrGW;
3) IP address(es) and port number(s) have been reassigned of the users. In
this case the binding(s) shall reflect the reassignment; and
4) No change has been made to the IP address(es) and port number(s). In this
case no change shall be made to the existing binding(s).
### 9.1.4 Interworking of SIP messages
The IMS-ALG behaves as a SIP B2BUA when interworking SIP messages. The IMS-ALG
shall forward all SIP messages transparently with respect to all methods,
result codes, headers and attachments except as follows:
\- The IMS-ALG modifies SDP according to subclause 9.1.1, subclause 9.1.3,
subclause 9.1.5 and clause 10.
NOTE: SDP not described in subclause 9.1.1, subclause 9.1.3 or clause 10 can
be handled according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [1] clause A.3.
\- When forwarding an incoming SIP request, the IMS-ALG should perform UAC
procedures towards the intended target according to IETF RFC 3261 [2], by
modifying those headers necessary to ensure that all transactions within the
dialog pass through the IMS-ALG.
\- When forwarding an incoming SIP response, the IMS-ALG should perform UAS
procedures towards the originator of the corresponding request according to
IETF RFC 3261 [2], by modifying those headers necessary to ensure that all
transactions within the dialog pass through the IMS-ALG.
\- The IMS-ALG may perform any appropriate error recovery procedures in the
event that an incoming message contains errors inconsistent with the
forwarding procedures above.
\- The IBCF can perform screening of SIP request and SIP responses based on
local policy as described in subclause 5.10.6 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [1].
At the receipt of a SIP BYE request, SIP CANCEL request or non-200 SIP final
response, the IMS-ALG shall release the session and request the TrGW to
release the bindings established for the session.
### 9.1.5 Modification of SDP bandwidth information for IP version
interworking
When the IMS ALG performs IP version interworking and passes an SDP offer or
answer, it should adjust any SDP b=AS bandwidth modifiers contained in the
SDP.
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 26.114 [36] annex K and annex Q contain information about
bandwidths for speech media transported over IPv4 and IPv6. 3GPP TS 26.114
[36] subclause 12.7.5 contains information how to convert b=AS for video
media.
NOTE 2: If the b=AS bandwidth modifiers are not adjusted, this can negatively
impact the end-to-end media negotiation (e.g. the selection of a speech codec
mode) and lead to an inaccurate resource reservation.
The IMS-ALG may support the enhanced bandwidth negotiation mechanism defined
in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36]. The enhanced bandwidth negotiation mechanism is based
on the \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute (defined in clause 19 of 3GPP TS 26.114
[36]) to negotiate the additional bandwidth properties end-to-end.
If the IMS-ALG receives an SDP body containing the \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute(s) and if:
\- the IMS-AGW interconnects call legs in IP domains where different IP
versions (IPv4 or IPv6) are used; and
\- the received \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines related to the same payload
type and the same direction do not contain bandwidth properties for both IPv4
and IPv6;
the IMS-ALG shall, before forwarding the SDP body:
\- re-calculate the received bandwidth properties (the maximum supported
bandwidth, the maximum desired bandwidth, the minimum desired bandwidth and
the minimum supported bandwidth for sending and/or receiving direction);
\- include in the modified \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines the IP version
used for the re-calculation of the bandwidth properties;
NOTE 3: If no IP version is included for any of the \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute lines related to a certain payload type and direction then IPv6 is
assumed for all bandwidth properties related to the same direction and payload
type, on all of the related \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines, see clause 19
of 3GPP TS 26.114 [36].
\- include the maximum packet rate assumed when re-calculating the maximum
supported bandwidth, the maximum desired bandwidth and the minimum desired
bandwidth properties; and
\- include the minimum packet rate assumed when re-calculating the minimum
supported bandwidth.
Otherwise, if the received SDP body contains bandwidth properties for both
IPv4 and IPv6 and if the IMS-ALG does not support or does not apply the
transcoding procedure defined in subclause 10.2.5, the IMS-ALG shall forward
the SDP body with unmodified \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines.
## 9.2 User plane transport
### 9.2.1 Payload transport
The TrGW shall use the established bindings described in subclause 9.1 to
transport the messages between the network A and the network B in the
following way.
At the receipt of a payload message the TrGW shall:
\- replace the received destination IP address(es) and port number(s) in the
payload message with the corresponding IP address(es) and port number(s) that
have been signalled by the IBCF; and
\- replace the received source IPaddress(es) and port number(s) in the payload
message with the corresponding IPaddress(es) and port number(s) the TrGW
allocated at its own terminations.
### 9.2.2 IP header interworking
#### 9.2.2.1 IPv4 to IPv6
When the TrGW receives an IPv4 message the following codings shall be set in
the IPv6 headers of the message sent to the IPv6 network.
\- If the DF bit is set and the packet is not a fragment (i.e., the MF flag is
not set and the Fragment Offset is zero) The IPv6 headers shall be set as
described in table 1;
\- If the DF bit is not set or the packet is a fragment the IPv6 headers shall
be set as described in table 2.
Table 1: Derivation of IPv6 Header from IPv4 header (no fragmentation)
* * *
**IPv6 field** **Value** Version 6 Traffic Class: The default behaviour is
that the value of the IPv6 field Traffic Class field is the value of the IPv4
Type Of Service field (all 8 bits are copied). An im­plementation of a TrGW
should also provide the ability to ignore the value of the IPv4 Type of
Service and always set the IPv6 traffic class field to zero. Flow label The
Ipv6 Flow Label Field is set to 0 (all zero bits). Payload Length The IPv6
Payload Length field value is the IPv4 Total length field value minus the size
of the IPv4 header and IPv4 options field length, if present. Next Header The
Ipv6 Next Header value is copied from IPv4 Protocol field HopLimit: The IPv6
Hop Limit value is The value of IPv4 field Time To Live minus 1. Source
Address Shall be handled as the addresses of the payload message as described
in subclause 9.2.1. Destination Address Shall be handled as the addresses of
the payload message as described in subclause 9.2.1.

Ipv6 Flow Label Field is set to 0 (all zero bits). Payload Length The IPv6
Payload Length field value is the IPv4 Total length field value plus 8 for the
fragment header minus the size of the IPv4 header and IPv4 options field
length, if present. Next Header The IPv6 Next header field is set to Fragment
header (44). Hop Limit: The IPv6 Hop Limit value is The value of IPv4 field
Time To Live minus 1. Source Address Shall be handled as the addresses of the
payload message as described in subclause 9.2.1. Destination Address Shall be
handled as the addresses of the payload message as described in subclause
9.2.1. Fragments headers  
a) next header Copied from IPv4 Protocol field. b) fragment Offset Copied from
the IPv4 Fragment offset field. c) More fragment bit Copied from the value of
the more fragment bit in the IPv4 flags field. d) Identification The value of
this field should be mapped from the triple of the source address, destination
address and IPv4 identification field of the incoming packet/fragments to a
unique value for the source and destination address of the outgoing IPv6
packet/fragments.
* * *
#### 9.2.2.2 Abnormal cases
If IPv4 options are present in the IPv4 packet, they should be ignored i.e.,
there is no attempt to translate them. However, if an unexpired source route
option is present then the packet shall instead be discarded, and an ICMPv4
\"destination unreachable/source route failed\" Type 3/Code 5 error message
shall be returned to the sender as defined in IETF RFC 792 [18].
When a translator receives the first fragment of a fragmented UDP IPv4 packet
and the checksum field is zero the translator should drop the packet and
generate a system management event specifying at least the IP addresses and
port numbers in the packet. When the translator receives fragments other than
the first it should silently drop the packet since there is no port
information to log.
When a translator receives an unfragmented UDP IPv4 packet and the checksum
field is zero the translator shall compute the missing UDP checksum as part of
translating the packet. Also, the translator should maintain a counter of how
many UDP checksums are generated in this manner.
#### 9.2.2.3 IPv6 to IPv4
When the TrGW receives an IPv6 message the following codings shall be set in
the IPv4 headers of the message sent to the IPv4 network.
\- If there is no IPv6 fragment header, the IPv4 header fields shall be set as
described in Table 3;
\- if there is an IPv6 fragment header, the IPv4 header fields shall be set as
described in Table 4.
Table 3: Derivation of IPv4 Header from IPv6 Header (no fragmentation)
* * *
**IPv4 field** **Value** Version 4 Internet header length 5 (No IPv4 options)
Type of Service The default behaviour is that the value of the IPv4 field Type
of service field is the value of the IPv6 Traffic class field (all 8 bits are
copied). An im­plementation of a TrGW should also provide the ability to
ignore the value of the IPv6 Traffic Class and always set the IPv4 Type of
Service field to zero. Total length The IPv4 Total Length field value is the
IPv6 Payload length value plus the size of the IPv4 headers. Identification
All bits are set to zero. Flags The more fragment flag is set to zero. The
Don't fragment flag is set to one. Fragment offset Set to zero. Time to live
(TTL) The value of the field shall be set to the received IPv6 Hop Limit field
value minus 1. Protocol The IPv4 field Protocol shall be set to the value of
IPv6 field The next header value. Header checksum Computed once the IPv4
header has been created. Source Address Shall be handled as the addresses of
the payload message as described in subclause 9.2.1. Destination Address Shall
be handled as the addresses of the payload message as described in subclause
9.2.1.
* * *
Table 4: Derivation of IPv4 Header from IPv6 Header (fragmentation)
* * *
**IPv4 field** **Value**
Version 4
Internet header length 5 (No IPv4 options)
Type of Service and Precedence: The default behaviour is that the value of the
IPv4 field Type of service field is the value of the IPv6 Traffic class field
(all 8 bits are copied). An im­plementation of a TrGW should also provide the
ability to ignore the value of the IPv6 Traffic Class and always set the IPv4
Type of Service field to zero.
Total length The IPv4 Total Length field value is the IPv6 Payload length
value plus the size of the IPv4 headers minus 8 for the Fragment header.
Identification The value of this field should be mapped from the triple of the
source address, destination address and IPv6 fragmentation header field
\"identification\" of the incoming packet/fragments to a unique value for the
source and destination address of the outgoing IPv4 packet/fragments.
Flags The IPv4 More Fragments flag is copied from the IPv6 M flag in the IPv6
Fragment header the IPv4.\ The Don\'t Fragments flag is set to zero allowing
this packet to be fragmented by IPv4 routers.
Time to live (TTL) The value of the field shall be set to the received IPv6
Hop Limit field value minus 1.
Protocol The IPv4 field Protocol shall be set to the value of IPv6 field The
next header value.
Header checksum Computed once the IPv4 header has been created.
Source Address Shall be handled as the addresses of the payload message as
described in subclause 9.2.1.
Destination Address Shall be handled as the addresses of the payload message
as described in subclause 9.2.1.
* * *
#### 9.2.2.4 Abnormal cases
If any of an IPv6 hop-by-hop options header, destination options header, or
routing header with the Segments Left field equal to zero are present in the
IPv6 packet, they are ignored i.e., there is no attempt to translate them.
However, the Total Length field and the Protocol field shall be adjusted to
\"skip\" these extension headers.
If a routing header with a non-zero Segments Left field is present then the
packet shall be translated, and an ICMPv6 \"parameter problem/ erroneous
header field encountered\" Type 4/Code 0 error message as defined in IETF RFC
2463 [19], with the Pointer field indicating the first byte of the Segments
Left field should be returned to the sender.
### 9.2.3 Fragmentation
If the DF flag is not set and the IPv4 packet will result in an IPv6 packet
larger than 1280 bytes the TrGW shall prior to transferring it in the IPv6
network:
\- Add the fragment header to the message; and
\- fragment the IPv4 packets so that their length, excluding the IPv4 header,
is at most 1232 bytes (1280 minus 40 for the IPv6 header and 8 for the
Fragment header).
### 9.2.4 Abnormal cases
As a part of decrementing the Time To Live /Hop Limit value and the TrGW
discovers that the zero value is reached the TrGW shall send an ICMPv4/ICMPv6
message with the error \"time to live exceeded in transit\" type 11 code 0 as
defined in IETF RFC 792 [18] and \"hop limit exceeded in transit\" type 3 code
0 as defined in IETF RFC 2463 [19].
# 10 IBCF -- TrGW Interactions
## 10.1 Overview
### 10.1.1 General
The present specification describes Ix signalling procedures and their
interaction with SIP signalling in the control plane, and with user plane
procedures. Each scenario or \"use case\" is described in a separate subclause
within subclause 10.2. 3GPP TS 29.238 [25] maps these signalling procedures to
H.248 messages and defines the required H.248 profile (which provides details
of used packages and parameters).
### 10.1.2 Network model
Figure 10.1.2.1 shows the network model. The broken line represents the call
control signalling. The dotted line represents the user plane. The IBCF uses
one context with two terminations in the TrGW.
Figure 10.1.2.1: Network model
### 10.1.3 Example Call Flow
#### 10.1.3.1 Basic Procedures
##### 10.1.3.1.1 Call Establishment
Figure 10.1.3.1.1.1 depicts the signalling flow for a call setup either from
or toward an external network.
1\. The IBCF receives an SDP offer in SIP signalling.
2\. The IBCF detects that one of the CS-TrGW functions is required, e.g.
NAPT/NAT.
3\. The IBCF sends a H.248 ADD command to create the outgoing termination and
to request resources to execute TrGW function.
4\. The TrGW creates the outgoing termination.
5\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 Add reply command and provides the
local address and port of the outgoing termination.
6\. The IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP using the information
coming from TrGW.
7\. SDP offer is sent to the network at the outgoing side.
8\. SDP answer is received by IBCF.
9\. The IBCF sends a H.248 MOD command to configure the outgoing termination
with address and port information received in the SDP answer.
10\. The TrGW configures the outgoing termination.
11\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 MOD reply command.
12\. The IBCF sends a H.248 ADD command to create the incoming termination and
to request resources to execute TrGW function.
13\. The TrGW creates the incoming termination.
14\. The TrGW replies to the IBCF with a H.248 Add reply command and provides
the local address and port of the incoming termination.
NOTE 1: Steps 12 to 14 may also be executed after step 2.
15\. The IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP using the information
coming from TrGW.
16\. SDP answer is sent to the network at the incoming side.
Figure 10.1.3.1.1.1: IBCF and TrGW interaction at Call establishment.
When creating the termination towards the IMS network or towards external
networks, the IBCF may also indicate that the IP Interface Type is \"MboIP\".
NOTE : Other values may be indicated by a CS-IBCF, as detailed in 3GPP TS
29.235 [29].
The IP Interface Type allows the TrGW to collect statistics per interface type
associated with the RTP bearer termination. The provision of these statistics
is outside of the scope of this specification.
##### 10.1.3.1.2 Call Release
Figure 10.1.3.1.2.1 depicts the signalling flow for a call release.
1\. The IBCF identifies that the call is to be release. Typically this will be
by the receipt of a SIP BYE request.
2\. The IBCF sends a H.248 SUB command to release the outgoing termination.
3\. The TrGW destroys the outgoing termination.
4\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 SUB reply command.
5\. The IBCF sends a H.248 SUB command to release the incoming termination.
6\. The TrGW destroys the incoming termination.
7\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 SUB reply command.
NOTE 1: Steps 5 to 7 may also be executed before steps 2 to 4 or in parallel
with steps 2 to 4.
NOTE 2: Rather than releasing the two terminations separately, the IBCF may
request the TrGW to release both terminations in a single request.
Figure 10.1.3.1.2.1: IBCF and TrGW interaction at Call release
## 10.2 Main Functions supported at the Ix Interface

\- Remote source port filtering;
\- QoS packet marking (differentiated services);
\- NAPT and IP Version Interworking;
\- Bandwidth policing;
\- Hanging termination detection;

\- RTP Header extension to signal Coordination of Video Orientation;
\- Generic image attribute;
\- Interactive Connectivity Establishment; and
\- Video Region of Interest (ROI).
### 10.2.1 NAPT and IP version interworking
NAPT and IP version interworking is documented in clause 9.
The IP Address and port conversion is configured by the standard Ix
interactions at call setup depicted in figure 10.1.3.1.1.1.
IP address and port conversion is mandatory every time a TrGW is inserted into
the path for any reason to guarantee that all IP packets are routed through
this entity.
### 10.2.2 Gate Management
The procedures in subclause A.7.1.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.235 [29] are applicable.
### 10.2.3 RTCP Handling
The procedures in subclause A.7.1.2.2.7 of 3GPP TS 29.235 [29] are applicable.
### 10.2.4 IP Realm Indication
Whenever requesting a new IP media-path (i.e. creation of IP bearer
terminations), the TrGW may indicate the correspondent IP realm/domain to the
TrGW. The TrGW shall assign the IP termination in the IP realm indicated. The
same IP realm shall be applied to all media streams associated with the
termination. The IP realm identifier shall not be changed after the initial
assignment.
A default IP realm may be configured such that if the TrGW has not received
the IP realm identifier and the TrGW supports multiple IP realms then the
default IP realm shall be used.
### 10.2.5 Media Control
#### 10.2.5.1 General
The transcoding functionality, where the TrGW processes and possibly converts
application / media data (like e.g. RTP payload) is optional for the TrGW and
IBCF to support.
The IBCF shall determine the TrGW transcoding capability through provisioning
and MGW selection, outside the scope of this specification.
IBCF procedures to offer transcoding in SIP/SDP signalling are described in
3GPP TS 23.228 [8] and in 3GPP TS 24.229 [1]. The IBCF shall only apply those
transcoding procedures if an attached TrGW supports transcoding. For media
with \"RTP/SAVP\" (see IETF RFC 3711 [34]) or \"RTP/SAVPF\" (see IETF RFC 5124
[35]) as transport protocol, the IBCF shall not offer or apply transcoding.
If the IBCF and available TrGW support transcoding, the IBCF may add codecs to
a SDP offer within a SIP request.
If the IBCF and available TrGW do not support transcoding, or if the IBCF
chooses not to offer transcoding, the IBCF shall pass SDP offers without
adding codecs to the SDP offer and the IBCF shall pass SDP answers without
modification to the contained codecs.
If the IBCF does not offer or apply transcoding procedures (as described
above) but inserts the TrGW for any other reason, the IBCF shall either not
signal media related information to the TrGW, or it shall signal the same
media related information for all interconnected terminations (i.e. identical
media configurations for the two connected H.248 stream endpoints).
If the IBCF does not offer or apply transcoding but signals media attributes
to a TrGW that does not support transcoding without having seized the peer
termination (see figure 10.2.5.3, Step 3) the TrGW\' shall accept this request
even though it cannot reserve any transcoding resources related to this media.
When the peer termination is seized and configured it shall be configured with
the same media related sub-fields in the media descriptor as for the first
termination. If the selected codec is not the same as the codec configured at
the first termination then this termination shall be modified before the peer
termination is seized.
NOTE 1: The signalling of such codec related information by an IBCF to a TrGW
not supporting transcoding is an implementation decision.
NOTE 2: A TrGW not supporting transcoding can use such codec related
information to learn that RTCP ports need to be reserved, and to derive
information about packet size and frequency useful for internal resource
reservation.
If the IBCF and available TrGW support transcoding and the IBCF includes in a
SDP offer additional codecs, the following procedures apply:
\- The IBCF may seize a termination towards the terminating user, using the
\"Reserve TrGW Connection Point\" procedure before sending an SDP offer with
added codecs to the terminating user. The IBCF may signal media related
information to the TrGW or omit media when adding the IP termination at this
stage.
NOTE 3: The signalling of media related information to a MGW requires that it
reserve the indicated resources before returning a positive response to the
H.248 command, by omitting media related information the TrGW does not need to
reserve any associated resources at this stage.
\- When the IBCF receives the SDP answer from the terminating user, the IBCF
shall check if any of the codecs offered by the originating side are contained
in the answer.
\- If only the codecs inserted by the IBCF are contained in the answer, the
IBCF shall configure the TrGW to transcode. If it previously performed a
\"Reserve TrGW Connection Point\" procedure it shall configure the TrGW using
the \"Configure TrGW Connection Point\" procedure towards the termination on
the terminating user side by supplying the media returned in the answer from
the terminating user, otherwise it shall perform a \"Reserve and Configure
TrGW Connection Point\" procedure. Within those procedures, the IBCF shall
supply the media returned in the answer from the terminating user. If the IBCF
seized the termination only at this point in time, it shall send the IP
address and port information received from the TrGW in the acknowledment to
the \"Reserve and Configure TrGW Connection Point\" procedure towards the
terminating user in a new SDP offer. The IBCF shall perform the \"Reserve and
Configure TrGW Connection Point\" procedure towards the termination on the
originating user side, supplying the preferred media offered by the
originating side.
\- If the returned SDP contains media offered by the originating user no
transcoding at the TrGW is required. If the IBCF previously performed the
\"Reserve TrGW Connection Point\" procedure the IBCF shall configure the TrGW
accordingly by either either supplying the same media related information for
all interconnected terminations or by omitting the media related information.
Some basic use cases are depicted in figures 10.2.5.1, 10.2.5.2, and 10.2.5.3.
1\. The IBCF receives an SDP offer in SIP signalling.
2\. The IBCF adds additional codecs to the subsequent SDP offer, giving
priority to those offered by the preceding node/network.
3\. In this example the IBCF seizes a TrGW prior to sending the new SDP offer;
as this scenario is preparing for a possible transcoding in the TrGW then a
TrGW supporting media shall be seized. The IBCF sends a H.248 ADD request
command to create the outgoing termination and to request IP resources to
execute TrGW function. As no media transcoding is yet known to be needed this
may be indicated by omitting media related sub-fields in the media descriptor
(i.e.signalling \"-\"). Alternatively the preferred codec (e.g. codec 1) may
be signalled in order to reserve this resource in the event that transcoding
was required.
4\. The TrGW creates the outgoing termination.
5\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 ADD reply command and provides the
local address and port of the outgoing termination.
6\. The IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP offer using the
information coming from TrGW
7\. The IBCF forwards the new SDP offer to the succeeding node.
8\. The SDP answer is received by IBCF. In this example the codec1 received in
the original SDP offer in step1 has been selected by the succeeding
network/terminating UE and the IBCF determines that transcoding is not
required.
9\. The IBCF sends a H.248 MOD request command to configure the outgoing
termination with address and port information received in the SDP answer. As
no media transcoding is needed this may be indicated by omitting media related
sub-fields in the media descriptor (i.e. signalling \"-\"). Alternatively the
selected codec (codec 1) may be signalled.
10\. The TrGW configures the outgoing termination.
11\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 MOD reply command.
12\. The IBCF sends a H.248 ADD request command to create the incoming
termination to configure this termination with remote address and port
information and to request resources to execute TrGW function. As no media
transcoding is needed this may be indicated by omitting media related sub-
fields in the media descriptor (i.e. signalling \"-\"). Alternatively the
selected codec received in step 8 (Codec 1) may be signalled.
13\. The TrGW creates the incoming termination.
14\. The TrGW replies to the IBCF with a H.248 ADD reply command and provides
the local address and port of the incoming termination.
15\. The IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP using the information
coming from TrGW.
16\. The SDP answer is sent to the network at the incoming side.
Figure 10.2.5.1: IBCF and TrGW interaction when the IBCF offers additional
codecs but no transcoding is required, and the TrGW is seized in advance.
1\. The IBCF receives an SDP offer in SIP signalling.
2\. The IBCF adds additional codecs to the subsequent SDP offer, giving
priority to those offered by the preceding node/network.
3\. In this example the IBCF seizes a TrGW prior to sending the new SDP offer;
as this scenario is preparing for a possible transcoding in the TrGW then a
TrGW supporting media shall be seized. The IBCF sends a H.248 ADD request
command to create the outgoing termination and to request IP resources to
execute TrGW function. As no media transcoding is yet known to be needed this
may be indicated by omitting media related sub-fields in the media descriptor
(i.e.signalling \"-\"). Alternatively the preferred codec (e.g. Codec 1) may
be signalled in order to reserve this resource in the event that transcoding
was required.
4\. The TrGW creates the outgoing termination.
5\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 ADD reply command and provides the
local address and port of the outgoing termination.
6\. The IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP offer using the
information coming from TrGW.
7\. The IBCF forwards the new SDP offer to the succeeding node.
8\. The SDP answer is received by IBCF. In this example the codec 3 added by
the IBCF to the SDP offer has been selected. Transcoding is therefore
required.
9\. The IBCF sends a H.248 MOD request command to configure the outgoing
termination with address and port information received in the SDP answer and
the selected media attibutes (codec 3).
10\. The TrGW configures the outgoing termination.
11\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 MOD reply command.
12\. The IBCF sends a H.248 ADD request command to create the incoming
termination to configure this termination with remote address and port
information and to request resources to execute TrGW function. As media
transcoding is required it indicates this explicitly with a codec selected by
the IBCF for the incoming termination from the offered codec(s) received in
step1.
13\. The TrGW creates the incoming termination.
14\. The TrGW replies to the IBCF with a H.248 ADD reply command and provides
the local address and port of the incoming termination.
15\. The IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP using the information
coming from TrGW and replaces the codec with the codec it selected for the
incoming termination.
16\. The SDP answer is sent to the network at the incoming side.
Figure 10.2.5.2: IBCF and TrGW interaction when IBCF offers additional codecs
and transcoding is required, and the TrGW is seized in advance.
1\. The IBCF receives an SDP offer in SIP signalling.
2\. The IBCF requires a TrGW for another use case but does not offer
transcoding.
3\. The IBCF sends a H.248 ADD request command to create the outgoing
termination and to request IP resources to execute TrGW function. As no media
transcoding is required this may be indicated by signalling \"-\".
Alternatively any codec (e.g. codec 1) can be signalled. If the IBCF selects a
TrGW that does not support transcoding, the IBCF may signal media related sub-
fields in the media descriptor to the TrGW if the TrGW supports media
encoding. The TrGW shall accept the ADD request even though it cannot reserve
any transcoding resources for the indicated media.
4\. The TrGW creates the outgoing termination.
5\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 ADD reply command and provides the
local address and port of the outgoing termination.
6\. The IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP using the information
coming from TrGW.
7\. The IBCF forwards the new offer to the succeeding node.
8\. The SDP answer is received by IBCF. In this example the codec 1 received
in the original SDP offer in step 1 has been selected.
9\. The IBCF sends a H.248 MOD request command to configure the outgoing
termination with address and port information. As no media transcoding is
needed this may be indicated by signalling \"-\" .Alternatively the selected
codec (codec 1) can be signalled.
10\. The TrGW configures the outgoing termination.
11\. The TrGW replies to IBCF with a H.248 MOD reply command.
12\. The IBCF sends a H.248 ADD command to create the incoming termination to
configure this termination with remote address and port information and to
request resources to execute TrGW function. As no media transcoding is needed
this may be indicated by signalling \"-\" .Alternatively media related sub-
fields in the media descriptor for the codec indicated to the incoming
termination may be signalled (e.g. the selected codec received in step 8
(codec 1).
13\. The TrGW creates the incoming termination.
14\. The TrGW replies to the IBCF with a H.248 ADD reply command and provides
the local address and port of the incoming termination.
15\. The IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP answer using the
information coming from TrGW.
16\. The SDP answer is sent to the network at the incoming side.
Figure 10.2.5.3: IBCF and TrGW interaction when IBCF does not offer
transcoding
#### 10.2.5.2 Handling of common codec parameters
The requirements as described in subclause 5.13.2 of 3GPP TS 23.334 [43] for
the IMS-ALG and the IMS-AGW, apply to the IBCF and the TrGW.
#### 10.2.5.3 EVS speech codec parameters handling
The Enhanced Voice Services (EVS) speech codec is defined in 3GPP TS 26.441
[52]. Its RTP payload type is defined in 3GPP TS 26.445 [53], and procedures
for its usage as IMS Multimedia Telephony speech codec are defined in 3GPP TS
26.114 [36].
The IBCF and the TrGW may support transcoding to and from the EVS speech
codec. If they do so, the requirements as described in subclause 5.13.3 of
3GPP TS 23.334 [43] for the IMS-ALG and the IMS-AGW, apply to the IBCF and the
TrGW.
#### 10.2.5.4 Rate adaptation for media endpoints
If the IBCF and the TrGW support rate adaptation for media endpoints using the
enhanced bandwidth negotiation mechanism defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36] the
requirements and procedures in the present subclause apply.
If the IBCF receives an SDP offer and if the IBCF and the TrGW apply the
transcoding procedure, defined in subclause 10.2.5.1, then the following
additional actions may be performed:
\- if the received SDP offer (figure 10.2.5.2, step 1) contained the SDP
\"a=bw-info\" attribute(s), defined in clause 19 of 3GPP TS 26.114 [36] for
payload type(s) that the IBCF retains in the forwarded SDP offer, the IBCF:
a) if the IP version interworking is required and the received \"a=bw-info\"
SDP attribute lines do not contain bandwidth properties for both IPv4 and
IPv6, should adjust the bandwidth properties in accordance with subclause
9.1.5; or
b) otherwise (if the IP version interworking is not required or the received
\"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines contain bandwidth properties for both IPv4
and IPv6), should forward the SDP offer with unmodified related SDP \"a=bw-
info\" attribute(s); and
NOTE 1: The IBCF can modify the related SDP \"a=bw-info\" attribute(s)
according to operator policies as specified in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36].
\- for the each added codec in the SDP offer (figure 10.2.5.2, step 6) the
IBCF shall include appropriate bandwidth information in new or existing
\"a=bw-info\" attribute lines(s).
If the IBCF then receives an SDP answer (figure 10.2.5.2, step 8) and if only
the codecs inserted by the IBCF with the corresponding SDP \"a=bw-info\"
attribute(s) are contained in the SDP answer the IBCF:
\- when requesting the TrGW to configure resources towards the succeeding node
(figure 10.2.5.2, step 9), shall include for the selected codec the
\"Additional Bandwidth Properties\" information element containing \"a=bw-
info\" SDP attribute(s) providing information for the selected codec in the
remote descriptor about bandwidths that will be used for the selected codec in
the sending direction towards the succeeding node;
NOTE 2: The included information corresponds to \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute(s)
from the received SDP answer for the \"recv\" or \"sendrecv\" direction.
\- shall select a codec from the ones in the previously received SDP offer
from the preceding node;
\- if the received SDP offer contained the SDP \"a=bw-info\" attribute(s) for
the selected codec:
a) shall construct appropriate SDP \"a=bw-info\" attribute(s) for the selected
codec according to the rules in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36]; and
NOTE 3: The offer/answer negotiation is performed for each \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute line, payload type, direction and bandwidth property individually.
b) shall include the \"Additional Bandwidth Properties\" information element
containing \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute(s) in the remote descriptor describing
bandwidths that will be used for the selected codec in the sending direction
towards the preceding node when requesting the TrGW to reserve resources
towards the preceding node (figure 10.2.5.2, step 12); and
NOTE 4: The included information corresponds to \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute(s)
in the sent SDP answer for the \"send\" or \"sendrecv\" direction.
\- include the selected codec with the corresponding SDP \"a=bw-info\"
attribute(s) in the modified SDP answer (figure 10.2.5.2, step 15) that will
be sent towards the preceding node.
If the received SDP answer contains codecs received in the SDP offer no
transcoding at the TrGW is required and the IBCF shall:
\- not include the \"Additional Bandwidth Properties\" information element
containing the \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute(s) when requesting the TrGW to
configure resources towards the succeeding node (figure 10.2.5.2, step 9);
\- not include the \"Additional Bandwidth Properties\" information element
containing the \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute(s) when requesting the TrGW to
configure resources towards the preceding node (figure 10.2.5.2, step 12); and
\- if the received SDP answer (figure 10.2.5.2, step 8) contained the SDP
\"a=bw-info\" attribute(s), the IBCF shall check:
a) if the IP version interworking is required and the received \"a=bw-info\"
SDP attribute lines do not contain bandwidth properties for both IPv4 and
IPv6, the IBCF may adjust the bandwidth properties in accordance with
subclause 9.1.5;
b) otherwise (if the IP version interworking is not required or the received
\"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines contain bandwidth properties for both IPv4
and IPv6), the IBCF shall forward the SDP answer with unmodified SDP \"a=bw-
info\" attribute(s).
The TrGW may use the \"Additional Bandwidth Properties\" information element
indicating media bandwidth range for rate adaption (i.e. to select an
appropriate encoding and redundancy) when transcoding media streams.
### 10.2.6 Media Inactivity Detection
The procedures in subclause A.7.1.2.2.6 of 3GPP TS 29.235 [29] are applicable.
### 10.2.7 QoS Packet Marking (differentiated services)
The procedures in subclause A.7.1.2.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.235 [29] are applicable.
Those procedures relate to Diffserv code point marking as described in IETF
RFC 2474 [31]
### 10.2.8 Hanging Termination Detection
The procedures in subclause A.7.1.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.235 [29] are applicable.
### 10.2.9 Bandwidth Policing
The procedures in subclause A.7.1.2.2.8 of 3GPP TS 29.235 [29] are applicable.
NOTE 1: In order to support services that generate media with variable bitrate
(e.g. video), the policing function needs to provide sufficient buffer space.
The derivation of the correspondent token bucket size can be based on the
estimated traffic volume over the expected maximum burst length (supposed time
interval of the burst). For example, for MTSI media, 3GPP TS 26.114 [36]
subclause 7.5.5 recommends a default period of 2 seconds for the derivation of
average bitrates and provides further considerations regarding suitable time
periods for speech and video.
NOTE 2: The IBCF can derive the sustainable data rate from bandwidth
parameters if it receives them within an SDP media description. The IBCF can:\
\- use the \"b=AS\" bandwidth modifier if received within an SDP body; or\ \-
if the IBCF supports the enhanced bandwidth negotiation mechanism, use the
\"maximum supported bandwidth for the receiving direction\" property value
from the \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute received within an SDP answer.\ If the
value of the \"maximum supported bandwidth for the receiving direction\" for
the selected RTP payload type differs from the value of the \"b=AS\" bandwidth
modifier, then the IBCF can use \"maximum supported bandwidth for the
receiving direction\" property value from the \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute to
determine the sustainable data rate for the selected RTP payload.
### 10.2.10 IMS end-to-end media plane security
#### 10.2.10.1 End-to-end security for RTP based media
An IBCF and a TrGW may support the end-to-end IMS media plane security for RTP
based media as specified in 3GPP TS 33.328 [32]. If supported, the IBCF shall
use the following procedures.
If the IBCF receives SDP containing media lines with \"RTP/SAVP\" (see IETF
RFC 3711 [34]) or \"RTP/SAVPF\" (see IETF RFC 5124 [35]) as transport
protocol, the IBCF shall:
\- forward the SDP with unmodified transport protocol for those media lines;
\- apply the procedures to not offer or apply transcoding defined in subclause
10.2.5; and
\- provide \"RTP/SAVP\" or \"RTP/SAVPF\", as received in the SDP, to the TrGW
as transport protocol for all related terminations, and not provide media
related information to these terminations, to configure the TrGW to pass media
and possibly associated RTCP control flows and not to reserve any resources.
NOTE: RTP/SAVP or SAVPF are provided to the TrGW even though it does not
reserve any resources for this as such, but this is needed in order to
allocate dual ports to support RTCP flows. These are also controlled as
described in subclause 10.2.3. For \"RTP/SAVP\" or \"RTP/SAVPF\", RTCP will be
encrypted and can not be interpreted by the TrGW. Media information is also
meaningless as encryption will modify the properties of the media streams.
If the IBCF receives SDP containing SDES SDP attribute(s) according to IETF
RFC 4568 [33], IBCF shall forward the SDP with unmodified SDES SDP
attribute(s), but shall not provide the SDES SDP attribute(s) to the TrGW.
#### 10.2.10.2 End-to-end security for TCP based media using TLS
An IBCF may support the end-to-end IMS media plane security for TCP based
media using TLS as specified in 3GPP TS 33.328 [32]. If supported, the IBCF
shall use the following procedures.
NOTE: End-to-end IMS media plane security for TCP based media using TLS does
not impact the TrGW.
End-to-end protection of MSRP (used in IMS session-based messaging) and BFCP
(used in IMS conferencing) media is based on TLS, according to the TLS profile
specified in Annex M of 3GPP TS 33.328 [32].
If the IBCF receives SDP containing media lines with \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" (see
IETF RFC 4975 [47] and IETF RFC 6714 [48]) and/or \"TCP/TLS/BFCP\" (see IETF
RFC 4583 [49]) as transport protocol, the IBCF shall:
\- forward the SDP with unmodified transport protocol for those media lines
and unmodified TLS related SDP attribute(s); and
\- indicate \"TCP\" to the TrGW as transport protocol for all related
terminations, and provide no media related information to these terminations,
to configure the TrGW to pass media transparently.
### 10.2.11 Through-Connection
The procedures in subclause A.7.1.2.2.9 of 3GPP TS 29.235 [29] are applicable.
### 10.2.12 Emergency Call
The procedures in subclause A.7.1.2.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.235 [29] are
applicable.
### 10.2.13 Explicit Congestion Notification support
#### 10.2.13.1 General
An IBCF and TrGW may support Multimedia Telephony using Explicit Congestion
Notification (ECN) according to IETF RFC 3168 [37], and may act as an ECN
endpoint to enable ECN with a local ECN-capable terminal within a local
network that properly handles ECN-marked packets.
#### 10.2.13.2 Incoming SDP offer with ECN
If the IBCF receives an SDP offer containing the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\"
attribute (see IETF RFC 6679 [38]), then if all of the following statements
are true:
a) the IBCF supports ECN according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [36];
b) the TrGW supports ECN according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [36];
c) the IBCF knows (via configuration) that the succeeding network supports ECN
according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [36]; and
d) the IBCF does not insert any transcoding;
then the IBCF shall:
\- if the \"ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute includes both the \"ice\" initiation
method and other initiation methods, remove the \"ice\" initiation method from
the \"ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute and forward the attribute with this
modification in the outgoing SDP offer;
\- if the \"ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute only includes the \"ice\" initiation
method, remove the \"ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute, any \"rtcp-fb\" attribute
with the \"nack\" feedback parameter and the \"ecn\" feedback parameter value,
and any \"ecn-sum\" parameter within a \"rtcp-xr\" attribute from the outgoing
SDP offer;
\- if the \"ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute did not includes the \"ice\"
initialisation method, forward the unmodified \"ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute
within the outgoing SDP offer; and
\- if the IBCF includes the \"ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute within the outgoing
SDP offer, forward the SDP offer containing ECN parameters to the succeeding
network.
Otherwise the IBCF shall remove the \"ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute, any \"rtcp-
fb\" attribute with the \"nack\" feedback parameter and the \"ecn\" feedback
parameter value, and any \"ecn-sum\" parameter within an \"rtcp-xr\" attribute
from the outgoing SDP offer.
If the IBCF forwarded the SDP offer containing the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\"
attribute and receives an SDP answer also containing the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\"
attribute (the reception of the attribute indicates a successful ECN
negotiation) then the IBCF shall forward the SDP answer to its preceding node
and shall indicate to the TrGW that it shall transfer ECN bits in IP header
transparently.
If the IBCF forwarded the SDP offer containing the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\"
attribute and receives an SDP answer without the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\"
attribute and the TrGW supports at least some of the initialisation methods
within the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute in the previously received SDP
offer,
NOTE 1: Only the \"leap\" initialisation method is supported over the Ix
interface in this release.
the IBCF shall:
\- act as an end point for ECN;
\- select an initialisation method supported by the TrGW;
\- determine if application specific feedback or ECN feedback messages shall
be used, taking into account whether the TrGW supports ECN feedback messages,
and the negotiation procedures in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36];
\- determine if ECN XR summary reports can be used, taking into account
whether they are supported at the TrGW, and the negotiation procedures in 3GPP
TS 26.114 [36];
\- send the SDP answer according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [36] and the capabilities
of the TrGW, containing the ECN attribute \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\"; and
\- indicate to the TrGW that it shall apply the ECN procedures (according to
3GPP TS 26.114 [36]) and act as an ECT endpoint.
If the IBCF receives an SDP offer containing the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\"
attribute and bullets a) and b) above are satisfied but if bullet c) or d) or
both are not met then the IBCF shall remove ECN related attributes before
forwarding the SDP offer. If the TrGW supports at least some of the
initialisation methods offered within the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute,
NOTE 2: Only the \"leap\" initialisation method is supported over the Ix
interface in this release.
the IBCF shall:
\- act as an end point for ECN;
\- select an initialisation method supported by the TrGW;
\- determine if application specific feedback or ECN feedback messages shall
be used, taking into account whether the TrGW supports ECN feedback messages,
and the negotiation procedures in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36];
\- determine if ECN XR summary reports can be used, taking into account
whether they are supported at the TrGW and the negotiation procedures in 3GPP
TS 26.114 [36];
\- send an SDP answer according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [36] and the capabilities of
the TrGW, containing the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute; and
\- indicate to the TrGW that it shall apply the ECN procedures (according to
3GPP TS 26.114 [36]) and act as an ECT endpoint.
The TrGW should not send RTCP XR ECN summary reports.
#### 10.2.13.3 Incoming SDP offer without ECN
If the IBCF receives an SDP offer without the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute
then if all of the following statements are true:
a) the IBCF supports ECN according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [36];
b) the TrGW supports ECN according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [36]; and
c) the IBCF knows (via configuration) that the succeeding network supports ECN
according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [36];
the IBCF may include the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute in the SDP offer it
forwards towards the succeeding node, indicating the related capabilities of
the TrGW.
NOTE: ECN XR summary reports and RTCP AVPF ECN feedback message are not
supported in this release towards IMS terminations.
If the IBCF inserted ECN attributes in the SDP offer and receives an SDP
answer containing the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute the IBCF shall act as an
endpoint and shall return the SDP answer to the preceding node removing the
\"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute, any \"rtcp-fb\" attribute with the \"nack\"
feedback parameter and the \"ecn\" feedback parameter value, and any \"ecn-
sum\" parameter within a \"rtcp-xr\" attribute, and shall indicate to the TrGW
that it shall apply the ECN procedures according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [36] and
act as an ECT endpoint. The TrGW should not send RTCP XR ECN summary reports.
If the IBCF inserted the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute in the SDP offer and
receives an SDP answer without the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute the IBCF
shall continue the call without any ECN active.
#### 10.2.13.3a Detection of ECN failures by TrGW
If the TrGW acts as ECN endpoint and detects an ECN-related error case, for
example non-ECT in the received packets when ECT(0) was expected or detecting
a very high packet loss rate when ECN is used, the TrGW shall notify the IBCF.
The IBCF should then initiate a session re-negotiation to disable ECN.
#### 10.2.13.4 Interworking with non-3GPP ECN IP terminal
##### 10.2.13.4.1 Support for additional ECN parameters
An IBCF and TrGW may support additional ECN parameter settings than defined in
subclause 10.2.13.2. The following sub-clauses describe the optional behaviour
if the IBCF and TrGW support these additional values.
##### 10.2.13.4.2 Incoming SDP offer from external IP network with ECN
If the IBCF receives an incoming SDP offer from the external IP network
containing values in the incoming SDP offer not supported by MTSI then it
shall configure the SDP offer as defined in subclause 10.2.13.2 when
forwarding the SDP offer to the IMS.
When receiving the SDP answer from the IMS the IBCF may configure the SDP
answer to the external IP network with alternative settings depending on what
is received from the IMS and what was offered by the external IP network. The
permitted alternatives are listed in table 10.2.13.4.1; the supported
alternatives are implementation options which need to be derived through
configuration or package auditing.
##### 10.2.13.4.3 Incoming SDP offer from the IMS with ECN
If the IBCF receives an incoming SDP offer from the IMS and it supports
additional ECN parameter settings than those defined in subclause 10.2.13.2
the IBCF may add these to the SDP offer forwarded to the external IP network.
When receiving an SDP answer from the external IP network the IBCF shall
respond to the IMS in accordance with subclause 10.2.13.2. If the IBCF
modifies any ECN-related parameters in the forwarded SDP answer compared to
the received SDP answer, the IBCF shall configure its TrGWas an ECN endpoint.
The permitted alternatives are listed in table 10.2.13.4.1; the supported
alternatives are implementation options which need to be derived through
configuration or package auditing.

#### 10.2.13.5 Message sequence chart
##### 10.2.13.5.1 ECN support requested (ECN endpoint)
Figure 10.2.13.5.1.1 shows the message sequence chart example for requesting
ECN.
Figure 10.2.13.5.1.1: Procedure to Request ECN
Upon receipt of a request to apply ECN the TrGW shall set the ECN field of the
IP header in accordance with 3GPP TS 26.114 [36] when sending any data
packets.
Upon receipt of any IP headers indicating ECN Congestion Experienced (ECN-CE)
the TrGW shall trigger rate adaptation in accordance with 3GPP TS 26.114 [36].
NOTE: ECN requires the IBCF to configure the TrGW with all media attributes to
allow rate adaptation even if no transcoding is required/supported in the
TrGW.
##### 10.2.13.5.2 ECN Active Indicated (ECN transparent)
Figure 10.2.13.5.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for indicating
ECN transparent.
Figure 10.2.13.5.2.1: Procedure to indicate ECN transparent negotiated
Upon receipt of the indication that ECN transparent has been negotiated the
TrGW shall forward IP packets with ECN bits set unmodified.
##### 10.2.13.5.3 ECN Failure Indication (ECN endpoint)
Figure 10.2.13.5.3.1 shows the message sequence chart example for an ECN
Failure Event.
Figure 10.2.13.5.3.1: Procedure to Report ECN Failure
When the IBCF receives a Notification indicating that a failure has occurred,
the MGCF may trigger a new SDP offer to disable ECN.
### 10.2.14 Optimal Media Routeing
An IBCF may support optimal media routeing (OMR) procedures, as defined in
3GPP TS 29.079 [39].
3GPP TS 29.079 [39] specifies that \"secondary media resources\" may be
allocated in addition to \"primary media resources\". If cotrolled by an IBCF,
such primary or secondary media resources are TrGWs controlled over the Ix
interface with procedures specified in the present specification.
If the IBCF applies OMR procedures, the following modifications to the
procedures within the present specification are applicable:
\- Under conditions specified in 3GPP TS 29.079 [39], the IBCF uses
information from OMR related SDP attributes as remote connection and port
information that is provided towards the TrGW within the call establishment
procedures in subclause 10.1.3.1.1.
\- Under conditions specified in 3GPP TS 29.079 [39], the IBCF encapsulates
local addess and port information, as received from the TrGW within the call
establishment procedures in subclause 10.1.3.1.1, in OMR related SDP
attributes.
\- Under conditions specified in 3GPP TS 29.079 [39], the IBCF uses
information from OMR related SDP attributes as codec information that is
provided towards the TrGW within the media control procedures in clause
10.2.5.
\- 3GPP TS 29.079 [39] specifies OMR-specific events that trigger the call
release procedures in subclause 10.1.3.1.2.
### 10.2.15 IP Realm Availability
The procedures in subclause A.7.1.2.2.5 of 3GPP TS 29.235 [29] are applicable.
### 10.2.16 Access Transfer procedures with media anchored in ATGW
The procedures in the present clause are optional to be supported for both
IBCF and TrGW when supporting the ATCF and ATGW functionality (see subclause
6.1.4).
The procedures in subclause 6.2.14 of 3GPP TS 23.334 [43] are applicable,
except that where the Iq interface is mentioned in those procedures, the Ix
interface is applicable.
### 10.2.17 Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) Support
#### 10.2.17.1 General
The Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) is specified in 3GPP TS 22.153 [44]. The
IBCF/TrGW may support the priority treatment of a call/session identified as
an MPS call/session. If MPS is supported then upon receipt of the MPS priority
information in the call control signalling:
\- The IBCF shall recognise the call/session as having priority.
\- The IBCF shall send the Priority information for a context to the TrGW to
enable the priority treatment described below related to the TrGW.
\- The IBCF shall apply priority handling to H.248 transactions related to
priority calls/sessions when network resources are congested, e.g.,
preferential treatment in any queues or buffers.
\- The IBCF may send the updated priority information and, if DiffServ is
used, provision a suitable DSCP marking for the updated MPS priority level to
the TrGW if it needs to change the priority information previously
communicated to the TrGW for an MPS call/session.
\- If the H.248 control association utilises a transport with the possibility
for prioritisation, the IBCF may apply priority using the appropriate
prioritisation procedures.
\- If the MPS Priority service requires a specific MPS DSCP setting, the IBCF
shall configure the TrGW to apply a specific MPS DSCP marking to the user data
transport packets to indicate that the packets are of a higher priority than
those for normal calls.
\- If the TrGW receives an indication to apply a specific MPS DSCP marking to
the user data transport packets, it shall apply this DSCP marking to the IP
headers.
NOTE 1: Support of Diffserv procedures by the TrGW assumes an operator uses
Diffserv for prioritising user plane traffic related to an MPS call/session.
\- When the IBCF marks a Context with Priority information, the TrGW may use
the Priority information for selecting resources for the media and signaling
transport with priority. The following actions may be taken by the TrGW if it
has reached a congested state:
i) seize priority reserved resources; or
ii) if resources are completely congested, indicate that in a Command Response
error code.
NOTE 2: The Priority information can be used to derive Layer 2 QoS marking and
trigger priority identification and priority treatment for other QoS
technologies than Diffserv.
This clause describes the Ix signalling procedures and their interactions with
SIP signalling in the control plane and with user plane procedures to support
the requirements for MPS. These Ix signalling procedures may or may not apply
depending on the network configuration (e.g. whether the TrGW is shared by
multiple IBCFs or whether the IBCF controls multiple TrGWs for a given route
-- Media Gateway Group).
The IBCF can receive a SIP INVITE with MPS priority information (see 3GPP TS
23.228 [8], subclause 5.21).
#### 10.2.17.2 TrGW Resource Congestion in ADD response, request is queued
If the IBCF requests a resource via the Reserve and Configure TrGW Connection
Point procedure or Reserve TrGW Connection Point procedure and receives an
error indicating that the requested resource could not be seized (e.g. H.248
error code #510 \"insufficient resources\") and the IBCF does not have an
alternative TrGW through which it can route the call/session, the IBCF queues
the priority call/session and gives it priority over any further Reserve and
Configure TrGW Connection Point or Reserve TrGW Connection Point procedures
for lower priority calls/sessions towards this TrGW until the requested
resource for this queued call/session is successfully seized. The example
sequence is shown in Figure 10.2.17.2.1.
Figure 10.2.17.2.1: Request to Reserve MPS priority call resources when TrGW
is congested
#### 10.2.17.3 TrGW Resource Congestion in ADD response, IBCF seizes new TrGW
If the IBCF requests a resource via the Reserve and Configure TrGW Connection
Point procedure or Reserve TrGW Connection Point procedure and receives an
error indicating that the requested resources could not be seized due to
congestion (e.g. H.248 error code #510 \"insufficient resources\") and Media
Gateway Groups are implemented the IBCF seizes a new TrGW from the same Media
Gateway Group before resorting to any queuing of the priority call/session (as
described in subclause 10.2.17.2) to enable the MPS call/session to proceed as
early as possible.
#### 10.2.17.4 TrGW Priority Resource Allocation
If the TrGW supports the Priority information (e.g. determined through
provisioning or package profile), the IBCF requests a resource via the Reserve
and Configure TrGW Connection Point procedure or Reserve TrGW Connection Point
procedure and includes the Priority information. The TrGW may then provide
priority allocation of resources once a congestion threshold is reached. The
example sequence is shown infigure 10.2.17.4.1. If the TrGW is completely
congested it shall indicate this to the IBCF as described in subclause
10.2.17.2.
Figure 10.2.17.4.1: Request to reserve MPS priority call resources when TrGW
is congested, priority resources are allocated
The TrGW may also provide priority allocation for resources requested via a
subsequent Configure TrGW Connection Point procedure not including Priority
information if the related context has been marked with priority information
during the Reserve TrGW Connection Point or Reserve and Configure TrGW
Connection Point procedure.
#### 10.2.17.5 TrGW Priority User Data marking
The IBCF may request the streams associated to an MPS call/session to be
marked with certain priority code point as described in subclause 10.2.7. The
TrGW shall then mark each IP packet header accordingly. The example sequence
is shown in figure 10.2.17.5.1.
Figure 10.2.17.5.1: Request to reserve IMS resources and apply DSCP marking
for MPS
#### 10.2.17.6 TrGW Priority Modification
If the IBCF seized an IP termination for a priority call/session with a
default priority and subsequently needs to modify the priority information
previously communicated to the TrGW (e.g. subject to subsequent authorisation
by an authorisation point, see 3GPP TS 24.229 [1] subclause 4.11), the IBCF
may modify the existing IP termination for the MPS call/session with the
actual priority and, if DiffServ is used, provision a suitable DSCP marking
for the updated MPS priority level to the TrGW via the Configure TrGW
Connection Point Procedure.
NOTE: The specific Ix related call sequence which details the handling to
support the requirements defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [1] subclause 4.11 and 3GPP
TS 23.228 [8], subclause 5.21 is not specified and therefore implementations
might exist which fulfil these requirements but do not require modification of
the priority information across the Ix interface.
### 10.2.18 Coordination of Video Orientation
#### 10.2.18.1 General
The IBCF and the TrGW may support the Coordination of Video Orientation (CVO)
as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36].
If the IBCF receives an SDP body containing the RTP header extension
attribute(s) \"a=extmap\", as defined in IETF RFC 5285 [45], and if
\"a=extmap\" attribute indicates a CVO URN(s) (i.e. the CVO URN for a 2 bit
granularity of rotation and/or the CVO URN for a higher granularity of
rotation) as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36], then:
a) if the IBCF and the TrGW support the CVO feature:
\- the IBCF shall include an \"extended RTP header for CVO\" information
element when seizing resources in the TrGW to indicate to the TrGW that it
shall allow the RTP header extension for CVO to pass; and
\- the IBCF shall forward within SIP signalling the SDP body received from the
preceding node to the succeeding node with unmodified \"a=extmap\"
attribute(s); or
b) if the TrGW does not support the CVO feature the IBCF shall forward within
SIP signalling, the SDP body received from the preceding node to the
succeeding node without any \"a=extmap\" attributes.
If the TrGW supports the CVO feature and has been instructed as described
above to pass on the extended RTP header for CVO for both incoming and
outgoing terminations then:
\- if the TrGW does not apply video transcoding, it shall pass any received
RTP CVO header extension to succeeding RTP streams; or
\- if the TrGW applies video transcoding, it shall keep the video orientation
unchanged during the transcoding and copy the received RTP CVO header
extension to the succeeding outgoing RTP stream(s) after transcoding the
associated group of packets.
NOTE 1: IETF RFC 5285 [45] provides a framework for header extensions and can
also be used for non-CVO related purposes. It is an implementation decision of
the TrGW if it only passes CVO related RTP header extensions, or if it passes
any RTP header extension when being instructed with the \"extended RTP header
for CVO\" information element.
NOTE 2: The behaviour of the TrGW when being instructed with the \"extended
RTP header for CVO\" information element only at one termination is an
implementation decision.
#### 10.2.18.2 Message sequence chart
Figure 10.2.18.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for indicating
extended RTP header for Coordination of Video Orientation.
Figure 10.2.18.2.1: Procedure to indicate RTP extension header for CVO
The IBCF shall send the \"extended RTP header for CVO\" information element
only with supported CVO URN(s) to the TrGW. If the TrGW does not support the
CVO feature, the IBCF shall not send the \"extended RTP header for CVO\"
information element to the TrGW.
NOTE: If the IBCF receives an SDP answer which includes the \"a=extmap\"
attribute with a CVO URN with a granularity that the TrGW has not included in
its response, or if the SDP answer does not include any \"a=extmap\" CVO
related attribute, it is not necessary to modify the TrGW for this reason
alone. Doing that would only add unnecessary signalling without requiring any
action or changes in the TrGW. However if the IBCF needs to modify the media
attributes for other purposes, in particular due to transcoding then the TrGW
is updated in accordance with the received SDP answer, that is, either with
the \"extended RTP header for CVO\" information element containing the
received CVO URN if the CVO related \"a=extmap\" attribute has been included
in the received SDP answer or without the \"extended RTP header for CVO\"
information element if the CVO related \"a=extmap\" attribute has not been
included in the received SDP answer (thus removing the requirement for sending
the received RTP header extension with CVO bits for the transcoded stream.
### 10.2.19 Generic image attributes
#### 10.2.19.1 General
The IBCF and TrGW may support a media-level SDP image attribute
\"a=imageattr\" defined in IETF RFC 6236 [46] to negotiate the image size for
sending and receiving video as required by 3GPP TS 26.114 [36].
NOTE 1: The image attribute may be used within the SDP capability negotiation
framework and its use is then specified using the \"a=acap\" parameter.
If the IBCF:
\- supports the negotiation of the image size;
\- receives an SDP body containing the image attribute(s) \"imageattr\"
defined in IETF RFC 6236 [46]; and
\- does not offer or does not apply transcoding procedures defined in
subclause 10.2.5;
the IBCF shall forward the SDP body with unmodified image attribute(s).
If the IBCF applies transcoding procedures defined in subclause 10.2.5 then
the following additional actions may be performed if the negotiation of the
image size is supported by the IBCF and the TrGW.
a) Upon receipt of an SDP offer containing the image attribute(s) from the
preceding node (figure 10.2.5.2, step 1) and if the received image sizes are
supported by the TrGW:
1) if the IBCF seizes an outgoing IP termination with the media related
information before sending the SDP offer the IBCF may send the generic image
attribute parameter to the TrGW (figure 10.2.5.2, step 3).
2) the IBCF shall include the SDP image attribute(s) \"a=imageattr\"
indicating the supported image sizes in the modified SDP offer (figure
10.2.5.2, step 6).
b) Upon receipt of an SDP answer from the succeeding node (figure 10.2.5.2,
step 8) and if the returned SDP answer:
1) does not contain the image attribute(s) and contains media offered by the
preceding node (i.e. no transcoding at the TrGW is required) then the IBCF
shall send to the preceding node the SDP answer without image attribute;
2) does not contain the image attribute(s) and if the IBCF is an endpoint for
the video stream (transcoding) then the IBCF:
\- may send the generic image attribute parameter to the TrGW when seizing or
modifying resources (figure 10.2.5.2, step 12); and
\- shall include the SDP image attribute(s) \"a=imageattr\" indicating the
supported image sizes in the modified SDP answer (figure 10.2.5.2, step 15);
3) contains the image attribute(s) and the media offered by the preceding node
(i.e. no transcoding at the TrGW is required) then the IBCF shall send to the
preceding node the SDP answer containing the received image attribute(s); or
4) contains the image attribute(s) and if the IBCF is an endpoint for the
video stream (transcoding) and if the received image sizes are supported by
the TrGW then the IBCF:
\- may send the generic image attribute parameters for the send and receive
directions to the TrGW when seizing or modifying resources (figure 10.2.5.2,
step 9 and step 12); and
\- shall include the SDP image attribute(s) \"a=imageattr\" indicating the
supported image sizes in the modified SDP answer (figure 10.2.5.2, step 15)
NOTE 2: The IBCF not supporting the negotiation of generic image attributes
will ignore the SDP image attribute received in the SDP offer and will return
the SDP answer without any associated SDP image attribute.
When sending the SDP body with image attribute(s) on the Mx interface the IBCF
shall include in the \"a=imageattr\":
\- \"recv\" keyword and corresponding image sizes which the TrGW supports in
the receiving direction; and
\- \"send\" keyword and corresponding image sizes which the TrGW supports in
the sending direction.
If the TrGW is configured with different image sizes on the receive direction
of one termination and the send direction of another interconnected
termination, then it shall adjust the frame sizes accordingly when forwarding
video media streams and use the image size as described in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36]
when sending media.
NOTE 3: The relation between the negotiated image sizes and CVO are specified
in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36].
NOTE 4: The generic image attribute includes information related to the send
and receive capabilities of a single termination, and the adjustment of image
sizes is typically based on the setting of two connected terminations in a
single context.
#### 10.2.19.2 Indication of generic image attributes
The IBCF may include the generic image attributes to the TrGW. The example
sequence is shown in figure 10.2.19.2.1.
The list of image sizes per payload type supported by the TrGW shall be
preconfigured in the IBCF. If the image sizes received within an SDP body on
the Mx interface are not all supported by the TrGW then the IBCF shall only
send the list of corresponding TrGW supported image sizes to the TrGW. If no
image size is supported by the TrGW, the IBCF shall not send the generic image
attribute parameter to the TrGW.
NOTE: shown sequence applies to the creation of the incoming termination T2
from the figure 10.2.5.2 and when both, the IBCF and the TrGW support the
generic image attribute. The outgoing termination T1 may be created in advance
(i.e. before sending SDP offer2) as shown in the figure 10.2.5.2 or upon
receipt of the SDP answer2. Even if the IBCF reserves the resources in advance
the media information may be omitted at this stage (as described in subclause
10.2.5) and thus the generic image attribute will not be sent to the TrGW if
the media information is omitted.
Figure 10.2.19.2.1: Request to reserve TrGW connection point with generic
image attribute
### 10.2.20 Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
The IBCF and the TrGW may support ICE functionality as specified in IETF RFC
5245 [50] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [1] to support a UE residing behind a remote NAT.
Support of full ICE functionality is optional, but if ICE is supported, the
IBCF and the TrGW shall at least support ICE lite as specified in IETF RFC
5245 [50]_._
The requirements for the IMS-ALG and the IMS-AGW as specified in subclause
5.17 of 3GPP TS 23.334 [43], apply to the IBCF and the TrGW when the ICE
procedures are supported.
### 10.2.21 MSRP handling
The IBCF and TrGW may support the handling of the Message Session Relay
Protocol (MSRP), IETF RFC 4975 [47]. If they support MSRP handling, they shall
apply the procedures as specified in the subclause 5.19 and subclause 6.2.19
of 3GPP TS 23.334 [43].
### 10.2.22 Alternative connection (ALTC) addresses management
An IBCF may support the ALTC functionality as specified in IETF RFC 6947 [51]
and 3GPP TS 24.229 [1] to advertise alternative IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6
address types) to the terminating side.
The requirements for the IMS-ALG as specified in subclause 5.21 of 3GPP TS
23.334 [43], apply to the IBCF when the procedures related to ALTC are
supported.
The ALTC procedures as described specified in subclause 6.2.20 of 3GPP TS
23.334 [43] are then applicable, except that where the Iq interface is
mentioned in those procedures, the Ix interface is applicable.
### 10.2.23 Video Region-of-Interest (ROI)
#### 10.2.23.1 General
The IBCF and the TrGW may support the video Region-of-Interest (ROI) as
defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36]. Three modes are specified for supporting ROI,
including \"Far End Camera Control (FECC)\", \"Arbitrary ROI\" and \"Pre-
defined ROI\". The IBCF and the TrGW may independently support any of these
modes.
#### 10.2.23.2 \"Far End Camera Control\" mode
##### 10.2.23.2.1 General
The procedures in subclause 5.22.2 of 3GPP TS 23.334 [43] are applicable.
##### 10.2.23.2.2 Message sequence chart
Figure 10.2.23.2.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for indicating
Video Region-of-Interest (ROI) using FECC.

#### 10.2.23.3 \"Predefined ROI\" mode
##### 10.2.23.3.1 General
The procedures in subclause 5.22.3 of 3GPP TS 23.334 [43] are applicable.
##### 10.2.23.3.2 Message sequence chart
Figure 10.2.23.3.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for indicating
Predefined ROI mode.
Figure 10.2.23.3.2.1: Procedure to indicate Predefined ROI mode
According to this procedure, the IBCF shall send to the TrGW the information
element on the RTCP feedback message capability for \"Predefined ROI\" type
expressed by the parameter \"3gpp-roi-predefined\" as described in 3GPP TS
26.114 [36], and the RTP Header Extension capability for carriage of
predefined ROI information as defined in IETF RFC 5285 [45] and 3GPP TS 26.114
[36]. In addition, the IBCF shall send to the TrGW the media-level SDP
predefined ROI attribute \"a=predefined_ROI\" defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [36].
#### 10.2.23.4 \"Arbitrary ROI\" mode
##### 10.2.23.4.1 General
The procedures in subclause 5.22.4 of 3GPP TS 23.334 [43] are applicable.
##### 10.2.23.4.2 Message sequence chart
Figure 10.2.23.4.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for indicating
Arbitrary ROI mode.
Figure 10.2.23.4.2.1: Procedure to indicate Arbitrary ROI mode
According to this procedure, the IBCF shall send to the TrGW the information
element on the RTCP feedback message capability for \"Arbitrary ROI\" type
expressed by the parameter \"3gpp-roi-arbitrary\" as described in 3GPP TS
26.114 [36], and the RTP Header Extension capability for carriage of arbitrary
ROI information as defined in IETF RFC 5285 [45] and 3GPP TS 26.114 [36].
### 10.2.24 SDP Capability Negotiation (SDPCapNeg)
#### 10.2.24.1 General
The SDP Capability Negotiation (SDPCapNeg) as specified in IETF RFC 5939 [57]
is adopted as an optional functionality to negotiate capabilities and the
associated configurations according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [1].
Upon receipt of an incoming SDP offer containing the attributes of SDP
capability negotiation, e.g. offer AVPF and AVP together for the RTP profile
negotiation using the \"a=tcap\", \"a=pcfg\" and \"a=acfg\" attributes, the
IBCF shall:
\- request the TrGW to reserve resources only for the default configuration
without SDPCapNeg, and make the decision on support of the alternative
configurations based on the IBCF/TrGW capability as provisioned before
forwarding the SDP offer, i.e. handling SDPCapNeg at the controller level; or
\- request the TrGW to reserve resources for all of these configurations by
signalling SDPCapNeg to the TrGW, and update the SDP offer based on the
response from the TrGW before forwarding.
NOTE: The additional benefit of signalling SDPCapNeg between the IBCF and the
TrGW is to check the resource availability for the corresponding
configurations and to avoid the further session failure in case of inadequate
resources for the configuration changes in the final confirmation. However,
due to the extra resources reserved only during the call establishment phase,
there is increased risk of call establishment failures.
In case the IBCF decides to request the TrGW to reserve resources for all of
those configurations, the IBCF shall:
\- use legacy SDP attributes as specified in IETF RFC 4566 [53] to do the
mapping of actual and potential configurations with the H.248 ReserveGroup
concept; or
\- use SDP extensions for SDP capability negotiation as specified in IETF RFC
5939 [57], if supported by the TrGW.
Before using SDP extensions for SDP capability negotiation as specified in
IETF RFC 5939 [57] towards the TrGW, the IBCF shall perform the necessary
checks (i.e. through auditing or via prior provisioning) to ensure that the
TrGW supports the syntax and capabilities requested. For an auditing the
procedure in subclause 6.1.8.1 is used with the \"SDPCapNeg Supported
Capabilities\" as the object.
When receiving a request from the IBCF with information element \"SDPCapNeg
configuration\" indicating the potential use of multiple configurations, the
TrGW shall reserve resources for all of those configurations that it supports
and shall send indicate the configurations for which it reserved resources in
an \"SDPCapNeg configuration\" information element in the response. The IBCF
shall update the SDP offer with SDPCapNeg configurations in the response from
the TrGW and shall forward the SDP offer to the next hop.
The IBCF may also provide SDP configurations to the TrGW with no dependency on
the incoming SDP offer, e.g. the IBCF may wildcard the supported
configurations in order to construct or update an SDP offer with the addition
of alternative configurations via SDPCapNeg attributes.
On receipt of an SDP answer with SDPCapNeg, the IBCF shall request the TrGW to
configure the resources for the selected configuration. If the TrGW previously
reserved any temporary resources for configurations that were not selected,
the IBCF shall also request the TrGW to release those resources.
#### 10.2.24.2 Message sequence chart
##### 10.2.24.2.1 Audit SDPCapNeg Supported Capabilities
The IBCF may request the TrGW to report the current values assigned to
distinct objects, here as the \"SDPCapNeg Supported Capabilities\" in the
TrGW. This procedure may be used when the IBCF is unsure of the applicability
for SDPCapNeg of the TrGW.
Figure 10.2.24.2.1.1 shows the message sequence chart example for the
auditing.
Figure 10.2.24.2.1.1: Audit Value of the TrGW
### 10.2.25 WebRTC Media Plane Optimization
#### 10.2.25.1 General
The IBCF and the TrGW may support the WebRTC media plane optimization as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [8], annex U.2.4, and 3GPP TS 24.229 [1], subclause
6.7.1.5.
The purpose of WebRTC media plane optimization procedures is to convey media
between WebRTC clients without bearer level protocol conversion. When both
ends are WebRTC IMS clients (WIC), the TrGW remain allocated but media plane
interworking is disabled.
The SDP attributes associated with WebRTC media plane optimization procedures
\"tra-contact\", \"tra-m-line\", \"tra-att\", \"tra-SCTP-association\", \"tra-
media-line-number\" and \"tra-bw\" are defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [1],
subclause 7.5.4.
#### 10.2.25.2 SDP offer handling
If the IBCF receives an SDP offer that contains any \"tra-contact\" SDP
attribute, and the IBCF decides to include a TrGW in the media path, the IBCF
shall:
1) reserve resources at the TrGW that are suitable for the media described in
the SDP offer outside the \"tra-m-line\", \"tra-att\" and \"tra-bw\" SDP
attributes.
2) include the address information as received from the TrGW in that contact
line and also encapsulate the address information into each received \"tra-
contact\" attribute, replacing previous information; and
3) transparently pass (in the forwarded SDP offer) all received \"tra-m-
line\", \"tra-att\", \"tra-SCTP-association\", \"tra-media-line-number\" and
\"tra-bw\" SDP attributes.
#### 10.2.25.3 SDP answer handling
If the IBCF receives an SDP answer and the SDP answer includes \"tra-m-line\"
media level SDP attributes, the IBCF shall:
1) configure the TrGW to transparently pass the media described in the
received \"tra-m-line\", \"tra-att\", \"tra-SCTP-association\", and \"tra-bw\"
SDP attributes; and
2) transparently pass all received \"tra-m-line\", \"tra-att\", \"tra-SCTP-
association\" and \"tra-bw\" SDP attributes.
NOTE: If interconnected H.248 Stream endpoints or terminations at the TrGW are
configured with transport \"UDP\", they will pass the payload within UDP
without modifications, known as UDP transparent forwarding. For WebRTC media
plane optimization, the UDP payload will be either DTLS encapsulating SCTP and
data channel(s), DTLS-SRTP encapsulating key management information, or SRTP
encapsulating audio or video media.
