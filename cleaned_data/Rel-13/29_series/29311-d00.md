# 4 Overview of service level interworking for messaging services
## 4.1 Introduction
The service level interworking for messaging services provides the
interworking function between Instant Message or Chat Sessions and the Short
Message to enable the communication between SM UE and Instant Message or CPM
UE. The architecture for service level interworking is specified in 3GPP TS
23.204 [6].
## 4.2 Service level interworking between SM and IM
In order to provide the service level interworking between SM and IM, the
following protocol mapping functionalities defined in 3GPP TS 23.204 [6] shall
be supported:
\- Instant Message mapped to Short Message over CS/PS;
\- Instant Message mapped to Short Message over IP; and
\- Short Message mapped to Instant Message.
## 4.3 Interaction with transport layer interworking
Both transport layer interworking and service level interworking shall be
provided by IP-SM-GW. The interaction between transport layer interworking and
service level interworking depends on the user subscription and authorization,
on the UE capabilities, and on operator policy.
If a user only subscribes to either transport layer interworking or to service
level interworking, only procedures defined for the subscribed interworking
shall be performed by the IP-SM-GW.
If a user subscribes to both transport layer interworking and service level
interworking, but the user is only authorised for one of the interworking when
the message is processed, only the authorised interworking shall be performed
by the IP-SM-GW.
If a user subscribes to both transport layer interworking and service level
interworking, and is authorised for both, the behaviour of the IP-SM-GW
depends on the specific scenario, on the registered capabilities of the UE,
and finally is defined by operator policy and user preferences.
## 4.4 Service level interworking between SM and Chat Session
In order to provide the service level interworking between SM and Chat
Session, the following protocol mapping functionalities defined in 3GPP TS
23.204 [6] shall be supported:
\- Chat Session invitation request mapped to Short Message;
\- Short Message mapped to Chat Session MSRP SEND request;
\- Chat Session MSRP SEND request mapped to Short Message;
\- Short Message mapped to Chat Session teardown request;
\- Chat Session teardown request mapped to Short Message; and
\- Event package for conference state information specified in IETF RFC 4575
[18] mapped to Short Message.

registered at the user\'s registrar (S-CSCF) as described in 3GPP TS 24.229
[3]; and
\- if the MSISDN is received in the message body of the SIP REGISTER request
within the \ XML element, then store the MSISDN.
Upon receipt of a SIP NOTIFY request the IP-SM-GW shall store the information
about the UE registration status and its ability for receiving Instant
Messages, i.e. if the public user identity has a contact registered with the
ability to receive Instant Messages.
NOTE 1: The ability of an UE to receive Instant Messages is included in the
Contact header field of the SIP REGISTER request as described in OMA-TS-
SIMPLE_IM [4].
NOTE 2: The IP-SM-GW will also receive information about the ability of the UE
to receive Short Messages over IP as defined in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5].
### 6.1.3 Handling of routing information
#### 6.1.3.1 Answering routing information query
The IP-SM-GW shall answer the routing information query which is received from
the HSS/HLR as described in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5].
#### 6.1.3.2 Querying of routing information
To retrieve the routing information needed for routing the translated Short
Message(s) to the servicing MSC or SGSN, the IP-SM-GW shall send the MAP-SEND-
ROUTING-INFO-FOR-SM message to HSS/HLR as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7]. The
IP-SM-GW shall include the following information in the MAP-SEND-ROUTING-INFO-
FOR-SM message:
a) Invoke-ID parameter set in accordance with 3GPP TS 29.002 [7];
b) MSISDN parameter set to the address of the associated SIP MESSAGE request
receiver retrieved as part of the subscriber data from the HSS at registration
by the IP-SM-GW or locally configured in the IP-SM-GW;
c) SM-RP-PRI parameter set in accordance with 3GPP TS 29.002 [7];
d) Service Centre Address parameter set to the address of the IP-SM-GW;
e) SM-RP-MTI parameter set to 0 (SMS Deliver);
f) SM-RP-SMEA parameter set based on the value of the P-Asserted-Identity
header field in the Instant Message if the P-Asserted-Identity header field
contains a E.164 address; and
g) GPRS Support Indicator parameter set to indicate that IP-SM-GW supports
GPRS specific procedure of combine delivery of Short Message via MSC and/or
via the SGSN in accordance with 3GPP TS 29.002 [7].
### 6.1.4 Delivering Short Message(s) as an Instant Message
#### 6.1.4.1 General
This section describes the procedure when the IP-SM-GW located in the
terminating network interworks Short Message(s) to an Instant Message.
IP-SM-GW procedures at the reception of the Short Message are described in
subclause 6.1.4.2.
The creation of the IM is described in subclause 6.1.4.3.
The creation of the Short Message delivery report is described in subclause
6.1.4.4.
#### 6.1.4.2 Receiving of SMS-DELIVER
When the IP-SM-GW in the terminating networks receives a Short Message from
the SMS-GMSC, it shall:
1) determine if service level interworking is needed for the served user (in
SM-RP-DA), i.e. if the served user is subscribed for service level
interworking and if multiple options are available to deliver the Short
Message, then user preference or operator policy indicates priority to receive
a Short Messages as an Instant Message; and
2) determine if service level interworking is allowed for the received Short
Message. Annex A specifies the transfer protocol level criteria that disallow
service level interworking.
The procedure when service level interworking is not allowed is described in
subclause 6.1.4.5
If service level interworking for the received SM is not needed, the IP-SM-GW
shall:
a) attempt to deliver the Short Message over CS/PS;
b) perform transport level interworking, as described in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5];
or
c) create a delivery report indicating failure.
If the received Short Message is the first segment of the concatenated Short
Message and the IP-SM-GW decides to use service level interworking, the IP-SM-
GW shall store and acknowledge all segments except the last segment of the
concatenated Short Message. When the IP-SM-GW receives the last segment of the
concatenated Short Message and the full length of the received concatenated
Short Message in Instant Message format is less than the allowed message
length of an Instant Message, the IP-SM-GW shall create an Instant Message
that includes the concatenated Short Message in accordance with subclause
6.1.4.3.1.
NOTE: The allowed message length of an Instant Message is defined in IETF RFC
3428 [8].
If the message length of the user generated Short Messages in IM format is
greater than the allowed message length of an Instant Message and the IM user
has registered the capability to receive Instant Messages, the procedure shall
be in accordance with subclause 6.1.4.3.2.
#### 6.1.4.3 Sending of Instant Message
##### 6.1.4.3.1 Sending of the Instant Message in a SIP MESSAGE request
After receiving either a single Short Message within a
MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE or a full set of concatenated Short Messages not
exceeding the size limit of a SIP MESSAGE request based Instant Message that
is to be delivered as an Instant Message, the IP-SM-GW shall send a SIP
MESSAGE request applying the related procedures for an AS acting as an
originating UA as defined in subclause 5.7.3 in 3GPP TS 24.229 [3]. In
addition, the IP-SM-GW shall include in the SIP MESSAGE request:
a) the Request URI set to a Tel URI or a SIP URI corresponding to the MSISDN
of the recipient. The IMSI received in the SM-RP-DA in the
MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE which corresponds to the MT Correlation ID previously
created when the SRI message was received, is used to obtain the MSISDN;
b) the P-Asserted Identity header field set to a Tel URI based on TP-OA
parameter received in MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE (SMS-DELIVER);
c) the appropriate MIME type(s) in the Content-Type header field;
d) an Accept-Contact header field with the IM feature-tag \"+g.oma.sip-im\";
e) a User-Agent header field to indicate the IM release version as specified
in OMA-TS-SIMPLE_IM [4];
f) a Request-Disposition header field with the value \"no-queue\", as
specified in IETF RFC 3841 [13], in order to ensure the SIP MESSAGE request is
not queued for delivery if the recipient is temporarily unreachable; and
g) the contents of the Body set to the contents of the Short Message(s)
formatted in appropriate MIME type based on received content in SM.
The IP-SM-GW shall send the SIP MESSAGE request to the S-CSCF.
##### 6.1.4.3.2 Sending of a large Instant Message
After receiving a full set of concatenated Short Messages exceeding the size
limit of a SIP MESSAGE request based Instant Message, the IP-SM-GW shall send
a SIP INVITE request applying the related procedures for an AS acting as an
originating UA as defined in subclause 5.7.3 in 3GPP TS 24.229 [3]. In
addition, the IP-SM-GW shall include in the SIP INVITE request:
a) an Accept-Contact header field with the IM feature-tags \"+g.oma.sip-im\"
and \"+g.oma.sip-im.large-message\";
b) a User-Agent header field to indicate the IM release version as specified
in OMA-TS-SIMPLE_IM [4];
c) in the Contact header field, the IM feature-tag \"+g.oma.sip-im\";
d) the Request-URI set to the public user identity deduced from the
information in SM-RP-DA;
e) the P-Asserted Identity header field set to a Tel URI based on TP-OA
parameter received in MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE;
f) a Request-Disposition header field with the value \"no-queue\", as
specified in IETF RFC 3841 [13], in order to ensure that the SIP INVITE
request is not queued for delivery if the recipient is temporarily
unreachable; and
g) in the SDP, the direction attribute set to a=sendonly as described in OMA-
TS-SIMPLE_IM [4].
The IP-SM-GW shall send the SIP INVITE request to the S-CSCF.
Upon receipt of a SIP 2xx response to the SIP INVITE request, the IP-SM-GW
shall send MSRP SEND request(s) containing the content of the concatenated
Short Messages as described in OMA-TS-SIMPLE_IM [4].
Upon receipt of corresponding response for the last chunk of the MSRP SEND
request, e.g. a MSRP 200, the IP-SM-GW shall generated a SIP BYE request to
release the session as in 3GPP TS 24.229 [3].
#### 6.1.4.4 Sending of SMS-DELIVER-REPORT
##### 6.1.4.4.1 Common Procedures
If the IP-SM-GW decided to send SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, it shall send the MT-
FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-ACK message to the SMS-GMSC in accordance with 3GPP TS
29.002 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [2] with the following information:
\- Invoke Id parameter set in accordance with 3GPP TS 29.002 [7];
\- if the received SIP response is not a SIP 2xx response, then the value of
the User error parameter shall be mapped from the SIP response Status Code as
described in Table 6.1.4.4.1.1;
NOTE 1: If the received SIP response is a SIP 2xx response then the User error
parameter is not contained in the MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-ACK message.

Upon receipt of a non-200 MSRP response to the MSRP SEND request sent as
described in subclause 6.1.4.3.2, the IP-SM-GW shall attempt to deliver the
Short Message in the next domains as specified in subclause 6.1.4.6. If all
retries fail, the IP-SM-GW shall apply the procedures defined in subclaue
6.1.4.4.1 to send the MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-ACK message for the last
segment of the concatenated Short Messages to the SMS-GMSC. In addition, the
User error parameter shall be set to \"System Failure\" and in SMS-DELIVER-
REPORT the TP-FCS element shall be set to \"FF Unspecified error cause\".
Upon receipt of a 2xx SIP response for the BYE request sent as described in
subclause 6.1.4.3.2, the IP-SM-GW shall apply the procedures defined in
subclause 6.1.4.4.1 to send the MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-ACK message for the
last segment of the concatenated Short Messages to the SMS-GMSC.
Upon receipt of a non-2xx SIP response for the the BYE request sent as
described in subclause 6.1.4.3.2, the IP-SM-GW shall attempt to deliver the
Short Message in the next domains as specified in subclause 6.1.4.6. If all
retries fail, the IP-SM-GW shall apply the procedures defined in subclaue
6.1.4.4.1 to send the MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-ACK message for the last
segment of the concatenated Short Messages to the SMS-GMSC.
#### 6.1.4.5 Procedure when delivery of a Short Message as Instant Message is
not allowed
If any one of the criteria specified in annex A indicate that service level
interworking of a Short Message is not allowed then the IP-SM-GW shall:
\- send an MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-ACK message to the SMS-GMSC in accordance
with 3GPP TS 29.002 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [2] and a REPORT-SM-DELIVERY-
STATUS message to the HLR/HSS as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7], if the
service level interworking was the last option to for Short Message delivery;
or
\- attempt to deliver the Short Message without applying service level
interworking according to operator policy, as described in 3GPP TS 23.040 [2]
and 3GPP TS 24.341 [5].
#### 6.1.4.6 Retry after unsuccessful delivery of Short Message
If the IP-SM-GW receives an error response when delivering a Short Message in
one domain (circuit switched domain, packet switched domain or IMS domain),
then based on operator policy, the IP-SM-GW shall attempt to deliver the Short
Message in the next domain in its sequence of priority for retries.
If all retries fail, the IP-SM-GW shall send a MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-ACK
message to the SMS-GMSC in accordance with 3GPP TS 29.002 [7] and 3GPP TS
23.040[2] and a REPORT-SM-DELIVERY- STATUS message to the HLR/HSS as described
in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7].
### 6.1.5 Delivering an Instant Message as a (concatenated) Short Message in
the terminating network
#### 6.1.5.1 General
This section describes the procedure when the IP-SM-GW located in the
terminating network interworks an Instant Message to Short Message(s).
IP-SM-GW procedures at the reception of the IM are described in subclause
6.1.5.2.
The creation and the delivery of a Short Message or concatenated Short
Messages are described in subclause 6.1.5.3.
IP-SM-GW procedures at the reception of the Short Message delivery report are
described in subclause 6.1.5.4.
The creation of delivery notification is described in subclause 6.1.5.5.
NOTE: Interworking for Large Message mode messaging as defined in OMA-TS-
SIMPLE_IM [4] is out of scope of this specification.
#### 6.1.5.2 Receiving of the Instant Message in a SIP MESSAGE request
Upon receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request including an Instant Message in the
terminating side, the IP-SM-GW shall:
1) check the recipient user\'s preferences, the current UE capability and
operator policy before delivering the message. If operator policy mandates
interworking or the recipient's preference is to receive an Instant Message as
a Short Message over CS/PS, the IP-SM-GW shall deliver the Instant Message as
a Short Message over CS/PS. If the UE of the Instant Message recipient is
capable of accepting SMSIP MESSAGE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5] and
operator policy mandates interworking or the recipient\'s preference is to
receive the message as a Short Message as a Short Message over IMS, the IP-SM-
GW shall deliver the Instant Message as a Short Message over IMS; and
2) check if it is possible to interwork the IM to an SM.
If the IP-SM-GW decided to interwork the IM to a Short Message (or
concatenated Short Messages) the IP-SM-GW shall:
1) if the CPIM body of the received SIP MESSAGE request includes a
Disposition-Notification header field with value \"positive-delivery\" or
\"negative-delivery\" (i.e. the IM sender requests the Instant Message
Delivery Notification) then store the values of the MESSAGE-ID Header
contained in the CPIM body; and
2) proceed as described in subclause 6.1.5.3.
#### 6.1.5.3 Sending of SMS-DELIVER (over CS/PS or IP)
##### 6.1.5.3.1 General
Upon receipt of an Instant Message that is to be delivered as a Short Message
over CS/PS, the IP-SM-GW shall query the routing information from HSS as
described in subclause 6.1.3.2 then send the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE to the
MSC or SGSN as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [2]. The
MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE shall be set as described in subclauses 6.1.5.3.2 and
6.1.5.3.3.
Upon receipt of an Instant Message that is to be delivered as a Short Message
over IMS, the IP-SM-GW shall send the SMSIP MESSAGE containing RP-DATA message
in the body to the S-CSCF as described in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5] and 3GPP TS
24.011 [9]. The SMSIP MESSAGE shall be set as described in subsclauses
6.1.5.3.2 and 6.1.5.3.4.
##### 6.1.5.3.2 Common Procedures
Both the SM-RP-UI parameter of the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE and the RP-User
Data element of the RP-DATA message in the SMSIP MESSAGE body shall be set to
SMS-DELIVER. And the elements of SMS-DELIVER message shall be set in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.040 [2], with the following information:
a) TP-MTI element set to 00 (SMS-DELIVER);
b) TP-MMS element set in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.040 [2];
NOTE 1: For example, for concatenated Short Messages, TP-MMS would be set to 0
while there are more messages to send.
c) TP-RP element set to 0 (TP-Reply-Path parameter is not set in this SMS-
DELIVER);
d) TP-UDHI element set in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.040 [2];
e) TP-SRI element shall be set to 1, if the SIP MESSAGE request contains in a
CPIM body a Disposition-Notification header field with the value of
\"positive-delivery\" or \"negative-delivery\" (i.e. the SIP MESSAGE request
sender requests the Instant Message Delivery Notification). Otherwise, the TP-
SRI element shall be set to 0;
f) if the SIP MESSAGE request contains the privacy header with \"header\" or
\"user\" or \"id\" and the operator policy allows sending of anonymous SMS,
the value of TP-OA element set to an anonymous value. Setting an address field
to an anonymous value is described in annex B. If the SIP MESSAGE request does
not contain the privacy header, the value of the TP-OA element set based on
the value of the P-Asserted-Identity header field in the Instant Message if
the P-Asserted-Identity header field contains a E.164 address;
NOTE 2: If no E.164 address is present in the P-Asserted-Identity header
field, the value of the TP-OA element will be implementation dependant.
g) TP-PID element set to 00000000 (SME-to-SME protocol);
h) TP-DCS element set in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.040 [2];
i) TP-SCTS element set to time when the IP-SM-GW received the Instant Message;
j) TP-UDL element set in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.040 [2]; and
k) TP-UD element set based on the content of Instant Message body.
If the content of the body in Short Message format is greater than the allowed
message length of a Short Message, then the IP-SM-GW shall send concatenated
Short Messages.
NOTE 3: In case of receiving MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message with the SM-
RP-UI parameter set to value SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, containing the User error
parameter for one segment of the concatenated Short Message, the default
action of the IP-SM-GW is not to send any remaing segment.
3GPP TS 23.040 [2] specifies that a Short Message supports GSM 7-bit and UCS2
encoded text while an Instant Message may support different text types as
defined in 3GPP TS 26.141 [16]. The IP-SM-GW shall reformat the received
Instant Message text into an appropriate text type supported for Short
Messages.
##### 6.1.5.3.3 Sending of SMS-DELIVER over CS/PS
The parameters of the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE shall be set as described in
3GPP TS 29.002 [7], with the following information:
\- Invoke-ID parameter set in accordance with 3GPP TS 29.002 [7];
\- SM-RP-DA element set to the address associated with the SIP MESSAGE request
receiver;
\- SM-RP-OA element set to the address of the IP-SM-GW;
\- More Messages To Send parameter set in accordance with 3GPP TS 29.002 [7];
and
NOTE: For example, for concatenated Short Messages, More Messages To Send
would be set to 0 while there are more messages to send.
\- SM-RP-UI parameter set to SMS-DELIVER.
##### 6.1.5.3.4 Sending of SMS-DELIVER over IP
The IP-SM-GW shall send the SMSIP MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5]
with the following exceptions:
\- the Request-URI mapped from the Request-URI of the associated SIP MESSAGE
request; and
\- the body of the request shall contain an RP-DATA message. The elements of
the RP-DATA message shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 24.011 [9], with the
following information:
a) RP-Message Type element set to 001 (network to MS);
b) RP-Message Reference element set in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.011 [9];
c) RP-Originator Address element set to the address of the IP-SM-GW; and
d) RP-User Data set to SMS-DELIVER.

##### 6.1.5.4.1 Receiving of SMS-DELIVER-REPORT over CS/PS
Upon receipt of MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message with the SM-RP-UI
parameter set to value SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, and if the associated SIP MESSAGE
request received before was delivered as a single Short Message, the IP-SM-GW
shall
\- send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the associated SIP MESSAGE request sender,
if the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message does not contain the User error
parameter. If the associated SIP MESSAGE request received before contains in a
CPIM body a Disposition-Notification header field with value \"positive-
delivery\", the IP-SM-GW shall send the Instant Message Delivery Notification
with a \"delivered\" indication to the associated SIP MESSAGE request sender;
or
\- attempt deliver the Short Message in the next domains as specified in
subclause 6.1.5.6, if the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message contains the
User error parameter. If all retried fail, the IP-SM-GW shall send a SIP 4xx
or SIP 5xx response. The Status code to be sent is determined by examining the
value of the User error parameter. Table 6.1.5.4.1.1 specifies the mapping of
the User error parameter as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7], to SIP response
status codes.
Upon receipt of MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message with the SM-RP-UI
parameter set to value SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, and if the associated SIP MESSAGE
request received before was delivered as concatenated Short Messages, the IP-
SM-GW shall wait for the last MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message. Then the
IP-SM-GW shall:
\- send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the associated SIP MESSAGE request sender,
if none of the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK messages contains the User error
parameter. If the associated SIP MESSAGE request received before contains in a
CPIM body a Disposition-Notification header field with value \"positive-
delivery\", the IP-SM-GW shall send the Instant Message Delivery Notification
with a \"delivered\" indication to the associated SIP MESSAGE request sender;
or
\- attempt deliver the Short Message in the next domains as specified in
subclause 6.1.5.6, if at least one of MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK messages
contains the User error parameter. If all retries fail, the IP-SM-GW shall
send a SIP 4xx or SIP 5xx response to the associated SIP MESSAGE request
sender. The Status code to be sent is determined by examining the value of the
User error parameter. Table 6.1.5.4.1.1 specifies the mapping of the User
error parameter as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7], to SIP response status
codes.

Upon receipt of an SMSIP MESSAGE with RP-ACK or RP-ERROR message in the body,
the IP-SM-GW shall respond with a SIP 202 (Accepted) response in accordance
with 3GPP TS 24.341 [5].
If the SMSIP MESSAGE contains RP-ACK message in the body, and the associated
SIP MESSAGE request received before contains in a CPIM body a Disposition-
Notification header field with value \"positive-delivery\", the IP-SM-GW shall
send the Instant Message Delivery Notification with a \"delivered\" indication
to the associated SIP MESSAGE request sender. If the associated SIP MESSAGE
request received before was delivered as concatenated Short Messages and all
the SMSIP MESSAGE contains RP-ACK message in the body for the concatenated
Short Messages, the IP-SM-GW shall send the Instant Message Delivery
Notification with a \"delivered\" indication to the associated SIP MESSAGE
request sender.
If the SMSIP MESSAGE contains RP-ERROR message in the body, the IP-SM-GW shall
attempt deliver the Short Message in the next domains as specified in
subclause 6.1.5.6. If all retries fail and the associated SIP MESSAGE request
received before contains in a CPIM body a Disposition-Notification header
field with value \"negative-delivery\", the IP-SM-GW shall send the Instant
Message Delivery Notification with a \"failed\" indication to the associated
SIP MESSAGE request sender. If the associated SIP MESSAGE request received
before was delivered as concatenated Short Messages and at least one of the
SMSIP MESSAGES contains RP-ERROR message in the body for the concatenated
Short Messages, the IP-SM-GW shall send the Instant Message Delivery
Notification with a \"failed\" indication to the associated SIP MESSAGE
request sender.
#### 6.1.5.5 Sending of IMDN
##### 6.1.5.5.1 Sending of IMDN after a (concatenated) Short Message delivery
over CS/PS
If the IP-SM-GW decided to send an Instant Message Delivery Notification, it
shall act as an originating UA as defined in subclause 5.7.3 in 3GPP TS 24.229
[3] to send a SIP MESSAGE request with the following exceptions:
a) the Request-URI shall contain a public user identity of the stored sender
identity of the associated SIP MESSAGE request;

value of the stored Message-ID Header in the CPIM body of the associated SIP
MESSAGE request; and
\- the \ XML element of the IMDN payload which shall be set to
\.
#### 6.1.5.6 Retry after unsuccessful delivery of Short Message
If the IP-SM-GW receives an error response when delivering a Short Message in
one domain (circuit switched domain, packet switched domain or IMS domain),
then based on operator policy, the IP-SM-GW shall attempt to deliver the Short
Message in the next domain in its sequence of priority for retries.
If all retries fail, the IP-SM-GW shall send a REPORT-SM-DELIVERY-STATUS
message to the HLR/HSS as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7].
#### 6.1.5.7 Error handling when interworking from Instant Message to Short
Message is not possible
When interworking is needed but is not possible, the IP-SM-GW shall send one
of the following error responses to the sender of the Instant Message:
\- If the error is because none of the content in the SIP MESSAGE request is
interworkable to a Short Message, then the IP-SM-GW shall send a SIP 415
(Unsupported Media Type) response and shall include an Accept header field
listing the types of text media supported by SM as described in 3GPP TS 26.141
[16]. For service level interworking of Instant Message to Short Message, only
text shall be supported.
\- Otherwise a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response shall be returned.
#### 6.1.5.8 Partial interworking from Instant Message to Short Message
If an Instant Message contains other media than text content, the IP-SM-GW may
remove the unsupported content.
Based on Operator policy the IP-SM-GW may insert text warning the receiver
that non-text content has been removed from the message.
### 6.1.6 Submitting an Instant Message as a (concatenated) Short Message in
the originating network
#### 6.1.6.1 General
This section describes the procedure when the IP-SM-GW located in the
originating network interworks an Instant Message to a Short Message.
IP-SM-GW procedures at the reception of the IM are described in subclause
6.1.6.2.
The creation of a (concatenated) Short Message is described in subclause
6.1.6.3.
IP-SM-GW procedures at the reception of the Short Message submit report are
described in subclause 6.1.6.4.
IP-SM-GW procedures at the reception of the Short Message status report are
described in subclause 6.1.6.5.
The creation of delivery notification is described in subclause 6.1.6.6.
NOTE: Interworking for Large Message mode messaging as defined in OMA-TS-
SIMPLE_IM [4] is out of scope of this specification.
#### 6.1.6.2 Receiving of the Instant Message in a SIP MESSAGE request
Upon receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request including an Instant Message, the IP-SM-
GW shall attempt service level interworking if operator policy mandates
interworking or the IP-SM-GW cannot find a SIP address for the recipient.
If IP-SM-GW determined that service level interworking needed, then the IP-SM-
GW shall:
1) check if the message originator is authorized for service level
interworking; and
NOTE: It can be assumed that all subscribers are authorized for service level
interworking if interworking is mandated by operator policy.
2) check if the service level interworking is possible.
If IP-SM-GW decided to submit the Instant Message as a Short Message, then the
IP-SM-GW shall:
1) respond with a SIP 202 (Accepted) response in accordance with 3GPP TS
24.229 [3];
2) store the values of the Request-URI, the P-Asserted-Identity header field
and the MESSAGE-ID Header contained in the CPIM body, if the received SIP
MESSAGE request includes a CPIM body and a Disposition-Notification header
field with value \"positive-delivery\" or \"negative-delivery\" (i.e. the SIP
MESSAGE request sender requests the Instant Message Delivery Notification);
and
3) proceed as described in subclause 6.1.6.3.
#### 6.1.6.3 Sending of SMS-SUBMIT over CS/PS
To submit a Short Message to the SC, the IP-SM-GW shall send
MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.040
[2]. In addition, for the information elements listed below, the following
interworking procedures shall apply:
\- Invoke-ID parameter set in accordance with 3GPP TS 29.002 [7];
\- SM-RP-DA parameter set to the address of user\'s home network Service
Centre configured in the IP-SM-GW, or retrieved as part of the subscriber data
from the HSS at registration by the IP-SM-GW;
\- if the SIP MESSAGE request contains the Privacy header field with
\"header\" or \"user\" or \"id\" and the operator policy allows sending of
anonymous Short Message, the value of SM-RP-OA parameter shall be set to an
anonymous value. Setting an address field to an anonymous value is described
in annex B. If the SIP MESSAGE request does not contain the Privacy header
field, the value of the SM-RP-OA parameter shall be set based on the value of
the P-Asserted-Identity header field or the address retrieved as part of the
subscriber data from the HSS at registration by the IP-SM-GW;
\- SM-RP-UI parameter set to SMS-SUBMIT; and
\- the elements of the SMS-SUBMIT message shall be set as described in 3GPP TS
23.040 [2] subclause 9.2.2, with the following information:

b) TP-RD element set to 1 (Instruct the SC to reject an SMS SUBMIT for an SM
still held in the SC which has the same TP MR and the same TP DA as the
previously submitted SM from the same OA.);
c) if the SIP MESSAGE request contains an Expires header field with a non-zero
value, the value of TP VPF element shall be set according to the TP VP
element. Otherwise, the value of TP VPF element shall be set to 00 (TP VP
field not present);
d) TP VP element set based on the Expires header field value and the optional
Date header field value;
e) TP-UDHI element set in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.040 [2];
f) if the SIP MESSAGE request contains in a CPIM body a Disposition-
Notification header field with the value of \"positive-delivery\" or
\"negative-delivery\" (i.e. the SIP MESSAGE request sender requests the
Instant Message Delivery Notification), the value of TP SRR element shall be
set to 1 (A status report is requested), Otherwise, the value of TP-SRR
element shall be set to 0 (A status report is not requested);
g) TP-MR element set in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.040 [2];
h) TP-RP element set to 0 (TP Reply Path parameter is not set in this SMS
SUBMIT);
i) TP-DA element set based on the value of the Request-URI in the Instant
Message as long as the Request-URI contains a E.164 address;
j) TP-PI element set to 00000000 (SME-to-SME protocol);
k) TP-DCS element set in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.040 [2];
l) TP-UDL element set in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.040 [2]; and
m) TP-UD element set based on the content of Instant Message body.

Short Messages.
NOTE: In case of receiving MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message with the SM-
RP-UI parameter set to value SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT, containing the User error
parameter for one segment of the concatenated Short Message, the default
action of the IP-SM-GW is not to send any remaing segment.
3GPP TS 23.040 [2] specifies that a Short Message supports GSM 7-bit and UCS2
encoded text while an Instant Message may support different text types as
defined in 3GPP TS 26.141 [16]. The IP-SM-GW shall reformat the received
Instant Message text into an appropriate text type supported for Short
Messages.
#### 6.1.6.4 Receiving of SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT
Upon receipt of MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK with the SM-RP-UI parameter set
to value SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT, not containing the User error parameter, and if
the associated SIP MESSAGE request received before contains in a CPIM body a
Disposition-Notification header field with value \"positive-delivery\" or
\"negative-delivery\" (i.e. the SIP MESSAGE request sender requests the
Instant Message Delivery Notification), the IP-SM-GW shall store the value of
TP Service Centre Time Stamp element.
Upon receipt of MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK with the SM-RP-UI parameter set
to value SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT, containing the User error parameter, and if the
associated SIP MESSAGE request received before contains in a CPIM body a
Disposition-Notification header field with value \"negative-delivery\", the
IP-SM-GW shall send the Instant Message Delivery Notification with a
\"failed\" indication to the associated SIP MESSAGE request sender. If the
associated SIP MESSAGE request received before was delivered as concatenated
Short Messages as described in subclause 6.1.6.3, and one of the
MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK for the concatenated Short Messages contains the
User error parameter, the IP-SM-GW shall send the Instant Message Delivery
Notification with a \"failed\" indication to the associated SIP MESSAGE
request sender.
#### 6.1.6.5 Receiving of SMS-STATUS-REPORT
Upon receipt of a MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE with the SM-RP-UI parameter set to
value of SMS-STATUS-REPORT, the IP-SM-GW shall:
\- retrieve the TP-Service-Centre-Time-Stamp and TP-Recipient-Address, then
find the associated SIP MESSAGE request instance containing the stored TP-
Service-Center-Time-Stamp and SM-RP-Originating Address element with the same
value; and
\- if the SMS-STATUS-REPORT matchs one associated SIP MESSAGE request, send an
Instant Message Delivery Notification or discard the SMS-STATUS-REPORT as
described in Table 6.1.6.5.1; or
\- wait for the last SMS-STATUS-REPORT, if the associated SIP MESSAGE request
was delivered as concatenated Short Messages as described in subclause
6.1.6.3. If all SMS-STATUS-REPORTs for concatenated Short Messages contains
the TP-Status element set to \"00000000\" and the associated SIP MESSAGE
request contains in a CPIM body a Disposition-Notification header field with
value \"positive-delivery\", the IP-SM-GW shall send the Instant Message
Delivery Notification with a \"delivered\" indication to the associated SIP
MESSAGE request sender. If at least one of SMS-STATUS-REPORT for concatenated
Short Messages contains the TP-Status element set between \"00000001\" and
\"00011111\" or between \"01000000\" and \"11111111\", and the associated SIP
MESSAGE request contains in a CPIM body a Disposition-Notification header
field with value \"negative-delivery\", the IP-SM-GW shall send the Instant
Message Delivery Notification with a \"failed\" indication to the associated
SIP MESSAGE request sender.

#### 6.1.6.7 Error handling when interworking from Instant Message to Short
Message is not possible
When interworking is needed but is not possible, the IP-SM-GW shall send one
of the following error responses to the sender of the Instant Message:
\- If the error is because none of the content in the SIP MESSAGE request is
interworkable to a Short Message, then the IP-SM-GW shall send a SIP 415
(Unsupported Media Type) response and shall also include an Accept header
field listing the types of text media supported by SM as described in 3GPP TS
26.141 [16]. For service level interworking of Instant Message to Short
Message, only text shall be supported.
\- Otherwise a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response shall be returned.
#### 6.1.6.8 Partial interworking from Instant Message to Short Message
If an Instant Message contains other media than text content, the IP-SM-GW may
remove the unsupported content.
Based on Operator policy the IP-SM-GW may insert text warning the receiver

### 6.1.7 Receiving of the Chat Session invitation request in the terminating
network
#### 6.1.7.1 Receiving of the Chat Session SIP INVITE request
Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE request addressed to an SMS user, the IP-SM-GW
shall assign an MSISDN to be used by the SMS user for the duration of this
Chat session to reach the sender of the SIP INVITE request.
If the SIP INVITE request contains the Privacy header field with \"header\" or
\"user\" or \"id\" and the operator policy allows this, the originator\'s
identity shall not be revealed to the SMS user for this Chat Session.
If operator policy mandates the SMS user to be informed of the Chat Session
invitation, the IP-SM-GW shall proceed with the procedures in subclauses
6.1.7.2, 6.1.7.3 and 6.1.7.4. Otherwise the IP-SM-GW shall proceed with the
procedures in subclause 6.1.7.5.
#### 6.1.7.2 Sending of the SMS-DELIVER (over CS/PS or IP)
Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE request that is to be delivered as a Short
Message, the IP-SM-GW:
1) may attempt to deliver Chat Session invitation request as SMS over IP, if
operator policy sets SMS over IP as highest priority for delivery attempts. If
this attempt succeeds, then the IP-SM-GW shall skip subsequent steps;
2) shall query the routing information from HSS as described in subclause
6.1.3.2; and
3) if routing information is available (SGSN and/or MSC address), the IP-SM-GW
shall attempt the delivery of a Short Message over IP, over CS, and PS. The
priority order of these attempts is an operator policy.
For the delivery of a Chat Session invitation request as a Short Message over
CS/PS, the IP-SM-GW shall send a MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE to the MSC or SGSN
as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [2]. The parameters of
the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE shall be set as described in subclauses
6.1.18.3.1 and 6.1.18.3.2.
For the delivery of a Chat Session invitation request as a Short Message over
IP, the IP-SM-GW shall send an SMSIP MESSAGE containing RP-DATA message in the
body to the S-CSCF as described in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5] and 3GPP TS 24.011 [9].
In addition parameters of the SMSIP MESSAGE shall be set as described in
subsclauses 6.1.18.3.1 and 6.1.7.2.4.
For every attempt the TP-UD element shall contain operator defined data that
should convey information to the SMS user that he is invited to send and
receive messages in the context of a Chat Session, and include for example,
instructions on how to accept, reject and leave the session. Since the TP-OA
element is set to an MSISDN assigned by the IP-SM-GW the MSISDN of the
original sender shall be included in the information sent to the SMS user
unless the SIP INVITE request contains the Privacy header field with
\"header\" or \"user\" or \"id\" and the operator policy allows this. For a
one-to-one Chat Session, the original sender is carried in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field of the SIP INVITE request, and for a group Chat Session,
the original sender is carried in the Referred-By header field.

##### 6.1.7.3.1 Receiving of SMS-DELIVER-REPORT over CS/PS
Upon receipt of an MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message with the SM-RP-UI
parameter set to value SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, and if the associated SIP INVITE
request received before was delivered as a single Short Message, the IP-SM-GW
shall:
\- proceed with the procedures in subclause 6.1.7.4; or
\- attempt deliver the Short Message in the next domains as specified in
subclause 6.1.7.2, if the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message contains the
User error parameter. If all retries fail, the IP-SM-GW shall send a SIP 4xx
or SIP 5xx response to the associated SIP INVITE request. The SIP response to
be sent is determined by examining the value of the User error parameter.
Table 6.1.5.4.1.1 specifies the mapping of the User error parameter as
described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7], to SIP response Status-Codes. If the IP-SM-GW
associated a specific MSISDN for the Chat Session, then the IP-SM-GW shall
release that MSISDN.
Upon receipt of an MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message with the SM-RP-UI
parameter set to value SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, and if the associated SIP INVITE
request received before was delivered as concatenated Short Messages, the IP-
SM-GW shall wait for the last MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message. Then the
IP-SM-GW shall:
\- proceed with the procedures in subclause 6.1.7.4, if none of the
MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK messages contains the User error parameter; or
\- attempt to deliver the Short Message in the next domains as specified in
subclause 6.1.7.2, if at least one of the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK
messages contains the User error parameter. If all retries fail, the IP-SM-GW
shall send a SIP 4xx or SIP 5xx response to the associated SIP INVITE request.
The SIP response to be sent is determined by examining the value of the User
error parameter. Table 6.1.5.4.1.1 specifies the mapping of the User error
parameter as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7], to SIP response Status-Codes. If
the IP-SM-GW associated a specific MSISDN for the Chat Session, then the IP-
SM-GW shall release that MSISDN.

the IP-SM-GW on the terminating side
When the IP-SM-GW receives a Short Message from the SMS-GMSC where the
recipient address in SM-RP-DA was associated with a Chat Session, it shall:
1) determine if the Chat Session associated with the recipient address in SM-
RP-DA is still active; and
2) determine if service level interworking is allowed for the received Short
Message. Annex A specifies the transfer protocol level criteria that disallows
service level interworking.
If the Chat Session associated with the recipient address in SM-RP-DA is not
available anymore, the IP-SM-GW shall create an SMS-Deliver-Report indicating
that messages to this recipient cannot be delivered. The procedures described
in subclause 6.1.13 ensure that the SMS user is informed that this Chat
Session is not available anymore.
The procedure when service level interworking is not allowed is described in
subclause 6.1.4.5.
If the received Short Message is a segment of a concatenated Short Message,
the IP-SM-GW shall store and acknowledge all segments except the last segment
of the concatenated Short Message.
After receiving either a single Short Message within one
MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE or a full set of concatenated Short Messages that is
to be delivered as a Chat Session message, the IP-SM-GW shall proceed with the
procedures in subclause 6.1.9.2.

### 6.1.10 Delivering a Short Message as an MSRP SEND request in an ongoing
Chat Session anchored in the originating network
#### 6.1.10.1 Receiving of SMS-DELIVER when recipient address is actual MSISDN
of recipient
For one-to-one Chat Sessions anchored in the originating network, the
procedures described in subclause 6.1.8 have the option to inform the SMS user
that this user should use the actual MSISDN of the CPM user to send messages
to this Chat Session. The IP-SM-GW shall be able to recognize that such an
MSISDN is associated with a Chat Session.
The procedure for receiving a Short Message from an SMS-GMSC are otherwise
identical for Chat Sessions anchored in the originating network and for Chat
Sessions anchored in the terminating network; the IP-SM-GW shall follow the
procedure described in subclause 6.1.9.1.
#### 6.1.10.2 Receiving of SMS-DELIVER when recipient is an MSISDN assigned by
the IP-SM-GW on the originating side

### 6.1.11 Delivering an MSRP SEND request in an ongoing Chat Session anchored
in the terminating network as a (concatenated) Short Message
#### 6.1.11.1 Receiving of the MSRP SEND request
This subclause describes the procedure when the IP-SM-GW located in the
terminating network receives an MSRP SEND request as part of an ongoing Chat
Session.
Upon receipt of one or more MSRP SEND requests,which constitute one chat
message, the IP-SM-GW shall proceed with the procedures in subclauses
6.1.11.2, 6.1.11.3 and 6.1.11.4.
#### 6.1.11.2 Sending of the SMS-DELIVER (over CS/PS or IP)
Upon receipt of one or more MSRP SEND request(s), which constitute one chat
message that is to be delivered as a Short Message, the IP-SM-GW:
1) may attempt to deliver the MSRP SEND request(s) as SMS over IP, if operator
policy sets SMS over IP as highest priority for delivery attempts. If this
attempt succeeds, then the IP-SM-GW shall skip subsequent steps;
2) shall query the routing information from HSS as described in subclause
6.1.3.2; and,
3) if routing information is available (SGSN and/or MSC address), the IP-SM-GW
shall attempt the delivery of a Short Message over IP, over CS, and PS. The
priority order of these attempts is an operator policy.
For the delivery of a chat message, received in one or more MSRP SEND requests
as a Short Message over CS/PS, the IP-SM-GW shall send a
MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE to the MSC/SGSN as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7]
and 3GPP TS 23.040 [2]. The parameters of the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE shall
be set as described in subclauses 6.1.18.3.1 and 6.1.18.3.2.
And in addition, the TP-UD element shall contain the content of the MSRP SEND
request(s). When the TP-OA element is set to an MSISDN assigned by the IP-SM-
GW, the MSISDN of the original sender shall be included in the information
sent to the SMS user (unless the Chat Session SIP request contains the Privacy
header field with \"header\" or \"user\" or \"id\" and the operator policy
allows this). For a one-to-one Chat Session, the original sender is carried in
the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the SIP request, and for a group Chat
Session, the original sender is carried in the Referred-By header field.
For the delivery of a chat message, received in one or more MSRP SEND
requests, as a Short Message over IP, the IP-SM-GW shall send one or more SIP
MESSAGE request(s) containing RP-DATA message in the body to the S-CSCF as
described in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5] and 3GPP TS 24.011 [9]. Each SMSIP MESSAGE
shall be set as described in subclauses 6.1.18.3.1 and 6.1.18.3.3.

Upon receipt of an MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message with the SM-RP-UI
parameter set to value SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, and if the associated MSRP SEND
request received before was delivered as a single Short Message, the IP-SM-GW
shall:
\- send an MSRP 200 response to the associated MSRP SEND request sender, if
the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message does not contain the User error
parameter. If the associated MSRP SEND request received before contains a
request for Success-Report, a REPORT shall be sent according to subclause
6.1.11.4 to the associated MSRP SEND request sender; or
\- attempt to deliver the Short Message in the next domains as specified in
subclause 6.1.5.6, if the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message contains the
User error parameter. If all retries fail, the IP-SM-GW shall send an MSRP
SEND error response. The response code to be sent is determined by examining
the value of the User error parameter. Table 6.1.11.3.1.1 specifies the
mapping of the User error parameter as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7], to
MSRP SEND response codes. If the associated MSRP SEND request received before
contains a request for Failure-Report, a REPORT shall be sent according to
subclause 6.1.11.4 to the associated MSRP SEND request sender.
Upon receipt of MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message with the SM-RP-UI
parameter set to value SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, and if the associated MSRP SEND
request received before was delivered as concatenated Short Messages, the IP-
SM-GW shall wait for the last MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK message. Then the
IP-SM-GW shall:
\- send an MSRP 200 response to the associated MSRP SEND request sender, if
none of the MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK messages contains the User error
parameter. If the associated MSRP SEND request received before contains a

6.1.11.4 to the associated MSRP SEND request sender; or
\- attempt to deliver the Short Message in the next domains as specified in
subclause 6.1.5.6, if at least one of MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE_ACK messages
contains the User error parameter. If all retries fail, the IP-SM-GW shall
send an MSRP error response to the associated MSRP SEND request sender. The
MSRP response code to be sent is determined by examining the value of the User
error parameter. Table 6.1.11.3.1.1 specifies the mapping of the User error
parameter as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [7], to MSPR response codes. If the
associated MSRP SEND request received before contains a request for Failure-
Report, a REPORT shall be sent according to subclause 6.1.11.4 to the
associated MSRP SEND request sender.

###### ## Annex B (normative): Anonymous SMS
# B.1 Scope
The present annex defines how the sending party\'s address (SM-RP-OA parameter
in case of SMS-SUBMIT, TP-OA element in case of SMS-DELIVER), which is
mandatory in SMS, is set to anonymise the sender\'s identity and to clearly
indicate that for the receiver of the SMS at the same time.
# B.2 Anonymous address in SMS
To indicate anonymous sender the address field representing the SM-RP-OA
parameter in case of an SMS-SUBMIT or the TP-OA element in case of SMS-DELIVER
should be set as follows:
\- length of address is set to 18;
\- type of number is set to alphanumerical;
\- numbering plan identification is set to ISDN/telephone numbering plan; and
\- the address value is set to \"Anonymous\" with the 7 bit character
representation, as the default alphabet defined in 3GPP TS 23.038 [24].
As an alternative, country specific text may be defined with the only
restriction that it must fit to the 10 character limit of the alphanumerical
type.
The recommended encoding of the \"Anonymous\" alphanumeric address is shown in
Figure B.2-1.
