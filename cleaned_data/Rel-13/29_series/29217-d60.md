# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**Home Routed Access: Roaming scenario where the** PCEF is located in the
HPLMN. In a Home Routed roaming scenario, the UE obtains access to the packet
data network from the HPLMN.
**RAN user plane congestion:** RAN user plane congestion occurs when the
demand for RAN resources exceeds the available RAN capacity to deliver the
user data for a prolonged period of time.
NOTE: Short-duration traffic bursts is a normal condition at any traffic load
level, and is not considered to be RAN user plane congestion. Likewise, a
high-level of utilization of RAN resources (based on operator configuration)
is considered a normal mode of operation and might not be RAN user plane
congestion.
**Visited Access (also known as local breakout):** Roaming scenario where the
PCEF is located in the VPLMN. In a Visited Access Roaming scenario, the UE
obtains access to the packet data network from the VPLMN.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR
21.905 [1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if
any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].

# 4 Np reference point
## 4.1 Overview
The Np reference point is located between the RCAF and the PCRF for the non-
roaming scenario, between the RCAF and the H-PCRF for the home-routed scenario
and between the RCAF and the V-PCRF for the visited access scenario. The Np
reference point is used for:
\- Reporting the RUCI from the RCAF to the PCRF;
\- Provisioning the Reporting Restriction from the PCRF to the RCAF;
\- The User Equipment (UE) mobility between RCAFs;
\- The removal of the UE context in the RCAF.
The stage 2 level requirements for the Np reference point are defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [2].
Signalling flows related to Np interface are specified in 3GPP TS 29.213 [3].
Refer to Annex G of 3GPP TS 29.213 [3] for Diameter overload control
procedures over the Np interface.
Refer to Annex J of 3GPP TS 29.213 [3] for Diameter message priority mechanism
procedures over the Np interface.

## 4.3 Functional elements
### 4.3.1 RCAF
The RCAF is a functional element which reports RAN User Plane Congestion
Information (RUCI) via the Np interface to the PCRF to enable the PCRF to take
the RAN user plane congestion status into account for policy decisions. RUCI
includes the following information:
\- The user id (e.g. IMSI) identifying the UE impacted by congestion;
\- PDN ID for which congestion information is reported;
\- Congestion level information (either congestion level value or congestion
level set id) of the UE impacted by congestion;
\- eNodeB identifier, ECGI or SAI identifying the eNodeB, E-UTRAN cell or
Service Area respectively, serving the UE if a conditional restriction to
restrict location reporting is not enabled.
NOTE 1: In case of E-UTRAN, whether the eNodeB identifier or the ECGI are
included in the RUCI is up to operator configuration in the RCAF.
The RCAF sends the RUCI to the PCRFs serving the UEs\' PDN connections as
follows:
\- For a PDN connection in a non-roaming scenario the RCAF reports the RUCI to
the PCRF;
\- For a PDN connection in a local breakout scenario, based on operator
configuration, the RCAF reports the RUCI to the V-PCRF;
\- For a PDN connection in a home routed scenario, based on the roaming
agreement with the HPLMN and operator configuration, the RCAF reports the RUCI
to the H-PCRF
NOTE 2: Reporting of congestion information to the HPLMN may be used e.g. in
case of a group of PLMNs which belong to a single business entity.
The RCAF determines whether a given PDN connection is served in a local
breakout or a home routed roaming scenario based on the APN operator
identifier received as part of the APN information from the MME or the SGSN as
documented in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [9], respectively.
NOTE 3: Operator configuration can be used to limit RUCI reporting on the Np
interface to certain APNs only.
The RCAF maintains a context per user id and APN. The context is identified by
the IMSI and the APN. It contains the following information:
\- The previously reported congestion level over the Np reference point;
\- The reporting restrictions received from the PCRF. The reporting
restrictions are stored by the RCAF until the PCRF explicitly signals to
remove the reporting restrictions.
\- The logical PCRF id received from the PCRF to identify the PCRF that is the
Np destination for the RCAF when sending aggregate messages.
### 4.3.2 PCRF
The PCRF is a functional element that encompasses policy control decision and
flow based charging control functionalities.
The PCRF may receive RUCI from the RCAF as input for policy decisions of
congestion mitigation. The PCRF may provide, update or remove the reporting
restrictions of RUCI, or stop or enable RUCI reporting for a given user id and
PDN ID. The PCRF may enable or disable the reporting of congestion location
identifier as part of RUCI. The PCRF may also remove the context at the RCAF
for a given user id and PDN ID.
NOTE: Depending on the RUCI reporting interval configured in the RCAF, a UE
can move outside the area indicated without the RCAF immediately notifying the
PCRF. In case the PCRF receives information about the cell currently serving a
UE via Np and Gx when the location change reporting is enabled, then the
information received via Gx is expected to take precedence.
### 4.3.3 H-PCRF
Functionality defined in clause 4.3.2 shall apply if UE is roaming with home-
routed access scenario.
NOTE: Reporting of congestion information to the HPLMN can be used e.g. in
case of a group of PLMNs which belong to a single business entity.
### 4.3.4 V-PCRF
Functionality defined in clause 4.3.2 shall apply if UE is roaming with
visited access scenario.
## 4.4 Procedures over Np reference point
### 4.4.1 RUCI Report
#### 4.4.1.1 General
The RCAF shall perform the RUCI reporting to the PCRF when at least one of the
following conditions applies:
\- the RCAF detects a UE in the congestion area for the first time;
\- a reporting restriction is enabled and the congestion level set id is
changed;
\- a reporting restriction is not enabled and the congestion level value is
changed;
\- a conditional restriction to restrict location reporting is not enabled and
the UE is in a congested area and the location is changed; or
\- the RCAF detects that the UE is no longer experiencing congestion (i.e. the
UE is no longer detected in any of the congested cells that the RCAF is
monitoring).
The RCAF shall report the RUCI to the PCRF unless the RUCI reporting is
disabled for the PDN ID or for the user id and the PDN ID.
Two types of RUCI reports may be used on Np for transfer of congestion
information from RCAF to PCRF: Non-aggregated RUCI report and Aggregated RUCI
report. If the RCAF does not know the destination PCRF for the user id and PDN
ID, the Non-aggregated RUCI report shall be used; otherwise the RCAF may use
either the Non-aggregate RUCI report or Aggregated RUCI report for the user id
and PDN ID.
#### 4.4.1.2 Non-aggregated RUCI report
For a Non-aggregated RUCI report, the RCAF shall send an NRR command to the
PCRF by including the user id within the Subscription-Id AVP, PDN ID within
the Called-Station-Id AVP and a congestion level set id within the Congestion-
Level-Set-Id AVP if the reporting restriction was provided earlier or a
congestion level value within the Congestion-Level-Value AVP if the reporting
restriction was not provided earlier at the command level. The RCAF may also
provide congestion location identifier of the UE within the Congestion-
Location-Id AVP in the NRR command. The RCAF shall also include the RCAF
Identity within the RCAF-Id AVP in every NRR command for a specific user id
and PDN ID.
Once the PCRF receives the NRR command, the PCRF shall store the related info
and respond with an NRA command including the PCRF id within the PCRF-Address
AVP. The PCRF may use the RUCI received from the RCAF as input for policy
decisions. When the RCAF receives the NRA command, the RCAF may store the PCRF
id in the UE context for this specific user id together with PDN ID for
further aggregated RUCI report.
If the ReportRestriction feature is supported by both the RCAF and the PCRF,
the PCRF may provide reporting restrictions in the NRA command according to
clause 4.4.2.
#### 4.4.1.3 Aggregated RUCI report
For an Aggregated RUCI report, the RCAF shall aggregate the RUCIs of different
user ids and PDN IDs that have the same destination PCRF. The RCAF shall send
an ARR command to the destination PCRF by including the PCRF id within the
Destination-Host AVP, one or more Aggregated-RUCI-Report AVP with a congestion
level set id within the Congestion-Level-Set-Id AVP if the reporting
restriction was provided earlier or a congestion level value within the
Congestion-Level-Value AVP if the reporting restriction was not provided
earlier, the PDN ID within the Called-Station-ID AVP and a list of aggregated
congestion information within the Aggregated-Congestion-Info AVP.
NOTE 1: Each instance of Aggregated-RUCI-Report AVP aggregates the user id
list of the subscribers that share the same level of congestion or share the
same congestion level set id.
NOTE 2: When the RCAF assembles a Diameter ARR command, if the message length
of ARR command has exceeded the maximum length of Diameter message which can
be configurable, the RCAF can divide the original ARR command into multiple
aggregated RUCI messages for the delivery over Np reference point.
Once the PCRF receives the ARR command, the PCRF shall store the related info
and respond with an ARA command. The PCRF may use the RUCI received from the
RCAF as input for policy decisions.
### 4.4.2 Reporting Restriction Provisioning
If the ReportRestriction feature is supported by both the RCAF and the PCRF,
the PCRF may provide the reporting restrictions for a specific user id and PDN
ID in the initial NRA command. The PCRF may also provide, modify or disable
restrictions for RUCI reporting or stop or enable RUCI reporting for the
specific user id and PDN ID at any later time. The PCRF may also use this
procedure to enable or disable the reporting of congestion location identifier
as part of RUCI.
In order to initially provide the reporting restrictions, the PCRF shall send
a Modify-Uecontext-Request (MUR) command including the targeted Subscription-
Id AVP indicating the user id, the Called-Station-Id AVP indicating the
targeted PDN ID and one or more Congestion-Level-Definition AVP(s) including
the defined congestion level set within the Congestion-Level-Set-Id AVP and
corresponding congestion level(s) within the Congestion-Level-Range AVP or
reply with an NRA command including one or more Congestion-Level-Definition
AVP(s) including the defined congestion level set within the Congestion-Level-
Set-Id AVP and corresponding congestion level(s) within the Congestion-Level-
Range AVP . The PCRF may also include the Reporting-Restriction AVP and
Conditional-Restriction AVP to indicate when conditional reporting
restrictions apply.
The PCRF may modify already provided reporting restrictions. To do so the PCRF
shall provide the complete list of congestion level sets and corresponding
congestion levels to be used in the same manner as when initially providing
reporting restrictions. This complete list shall replace any previously
provided list. The absence of Reporting-Restriction AVP and Conditional-
Restriction AVP indicates that previous state of reporting restrictions
remains valid.
If reporting restrictions has been provided for a specific user id and PDN ID,
the PCRF may remove the reporting restrictions by, in the MUR command,
including the Reporting-Restriction AVP set to 0 (No reporting restriction),
together with Subscription-Id AVP indicating the user id and the Called-
Station-Id AVP indicating the targeted PDN ID or reply with an NRA command
including the Reporting-Restriction AVP set to 0 (No reporting restriction).
The PCRF may disable RUCI reporting by, in the MUR command, including the
RUCI-Action AVP set to 0 (Disable RUCI Reporting), together with Subscription-
Id AVP indicating the user id and the Called-Station-Id AVP indicating the
targeted PDN ID or reply with an NRA command including the RUCI-Action AVP set
to 0 (Disable RUCI Reporting).
To enable RUCI Reporting if previously disabled, the PCRF in the MUR command
shall include the RUCI-Action AVP set to1 (Enable RUCI Reporting), together
with Subscription-Id AVP indicating the user id and the Called-Station-Id AVP
indicating the targeted PDN ID or reply with an NRA command including the
RUCI-Action AVP set to 1 (Enable RUCI Reporting).
If reporting restrictions also applies, the PCRF shall include one or more
Congestion-Level-Definition AVP(s) including the defined congestion level set
with the Congestion-Level-Set-Id AVP and corresponding congestion level(s)
within the Congestion-Level-Range AVP, within the same command.
To provision the reporting restriction which disables the reporting of
congestion location identifier of the UE as part of RUCI, the PCRF shall
include Reporting-Restriction AVP set to 1 (Conditional reporting restriction)
and Conditional-Restriction AVP with the bit 0 be set. To enable a previously
disabled reporting of the congestion location identifier of the UE as part of
RUCI, the PCRF shall include Reporting-Restriction AVP set to 2 (Unconditional
reporting restriction).
The PCRF shall include the value of the RCAF-Id AVP received in the NRR
command for the specific user id and PDN ID in the Destination-Host AVP of the
MUR command.
The RCAF acknowledges the received MUR command by sending a Modify-Uecontext-
Answer (MUA) command in all cases above.
### 4.4.3 UE mobility between RCAFs
If RUCI reporting is used for a specific user id and PDN ID and the PCRF
receives a new non-aggregated RUCI report for the same user id and PDN ID but
with a different RCAF id included in the RCAF-Id AVP, the PCRF shall update
the related information and respond with an NRA command according to clause
4.4.1.1.
The PCRF shall also initiate a removal of the UE context to the old RCAF
according to clause 4.4.4.
### 4.4.4 Removal of UE context
This procedure is initiated when the PCRF needs to remove a UE context from
the RCAF, e.g. at UE mobility between RCAFs.
If the PCRF due to an event determines that a UE context needs to be removed
from the RCAF, the PCRF shall send an MUR command to the targeted RCAF to
explicitly release the context related to the user id and PDN ID by including
the Subscription-Id AVP indicating the user id, the Called-Station-Id AVP
indicating the PDN ID, the Destination-Host AVP indicating the targeted RCAF
id and the RUCI-Action AVP set to 2 (Release Context).
The RCAF when receiving the MUR command from the PCRF shall release the
context related to the user id and PDN ID. If this is the last PDN ID stored
for this user id the RCAF shall release the complete context.
The RCAF shall acknowledge the received MUR command by sending an MUA command.
### 4.4.5 Race condition handling
If the RCAF receives an MUR command to remove a context for a specific user id
and PDN ID, the request shall be handled immediately, regardless of whether
there are any ongoing RUCI report transactions for that user id and PDN ID.
If the PCRF receives an NRR command for a specific user id and PDN ID, and if
there is an ongoing MUR command to remove the context for that user id and PDN
ID, the PCRF shall reject the incoming request with a Diameter experimental
result code of DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION.
If the PCRF receives an ARR command for specific user id and PDN ID
combinations for which there is at least one ongoing MUR command to remove the
context, the PCRF shall accept the request and only update the context(s) that
are not in the process of being removed.
# 5 Np protocol
## 5.1 Protocol support
The Np application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application, where
the vendor is 3GPP and the Application-ID for the Np Application in the
present release is 16777342. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
NOTE: A route entry can have a different destination based on the application
identification AVP of the message. Therefore, Diameter agents (relay, proxy,
redirection, translation agents) must be configured appropriately to identify
the 3GPP Np application within the Auth-Application-Id AVP in order to create
suitable routeing tables.
With regard to the Diameter protocol defined over the Np interface, the PCRF
acts as a Diameter server, in the sense that it is the network element that
handles the RUCI reporting for a particular realm. The RCAF acts as the
Diameter client, in the sense that it is the network element reporting the
RUCI.
## 5.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between the RCAF and PCRF
are defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance of
connections between Diameter nodes are described in IETF RFC 3588 [7].
After establishing the transport connection, the RCAF and the PCRF shall
advertise the support of the Np specific Application by including the value of
the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the
3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP
contained in the Capabilitiesâ€‘Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC 3588
[7]).
The Np Diameter session shall be terminated after each request and answer pair
interaction.
In order to indicate that the session state is not to be maintained, the
Diameter client and server shall include the Auth-Session-State AVP with the
value set to NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1), in the request and in the answer
messages (see IETF RFC 3588 [7]).
## 5.3 Np specific AVPs
### 5.3.1 General
Table 5.3.1.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the Np reference point,
their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the AVP may
be encrypted and which supported features the AVP is applicable to. The
Vendor-Id header of all AVPs defined in the present document shall be set to
3GPP (10415).

*[ AVP ]
### 5.3.9 Conditional-Restriction AVP
The Conditional-Restriction AVP (AVP code 4007) is of type Unsigned32 and it
shall contain a bit mask, and indicates what conditional reporting
restrictions apply. Conditional reporting restrictions shall apply when this
AVP is provided. The bit 0 shall be the least significant bit. For example, to
get the value of bit 0, a bit mask of 0x0001 should be used. The meaning of
the bits shall be as defined below:
Table 5.3.9.1: Conditional-Restriction over Np
* * *
Bit Name Description 0 UE location info not included in RUCI This bit, when
set, indicates that the location information of the UE shall not be included
in RUCI for reporting.

## 5.4 Np re-used AVPs
### 5.4.1 General
Table 5.4.1.1 lists the Diameter AVPs re-used by the Np reference point from
other existing Diameter Applications, reference to their respective
specifications, short description of their usage within the Np reference point
and which supported features the AVP is applicable to. AVPs from existing
Diameter Applications, except for the AVPs from Diameter base protocol, do not
need to be supported. The AVPs from Diameter base protocol are not included in
table 5.4.1.1, but they are re-used for the Np reference point. Unless
otherwise stated, re-used AVPs shall maintain their \'M\', \'P\' and \'V\'
flag settings. Where RADIUS VSAs are re-used, unless otherwise stated, they
shall be translated to Diameter AVPs as described in RFC 4005 [4] with the
exception that the \'M\' flag shall be set and the \'P\' flag may be set.

### 5.4.2 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Np reference point
When new functionality is introduced on the Np reference point, it should be
defined as optional. If backwards incompatible changes cannot be avoided, the
new functionality shall be introduced as a new feature and support advertised
with the Supported-Features AVP. Unless otherwise stated, the use of the
Supported-Features AVP on the Np reference point shall be compliant to the
usage of the Supported-Features AVP on the Cx reference point and consistent
with the procedures for the dynamic discovery of supported features as defined
in clause 7.2 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [6].
When extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs
shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined mandatory in the
command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [6], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the all reference points as specified in this specification, the Supported-
Features AVP is used to identify features that have been defined by 3GPP and
hence, for features defined in this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain
the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415). If there are multiple feature lists defined for
the reference point, the Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists
from one another.
The Supported-Features AVP shall be included in every NRR and NRA command if
supported by the RCAF and PCRF respectively.
The table below defines the features applicable to the Np interface for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.

## 5.5 Np specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### 5.5.1 General
This clause defines result code values that shall be supported by Diameter
implementations that conform to this specification.
### 5.5.2 Success
Result Codes that fall into the Success category are used to inform a peer
that a request has been successfully completed. The Result-Code AVP values
defined in Diameter BASE IETF RFC 3588 [7] are applied.
### 5.5.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall into the Permanent Failures category shall be used to inform
the peer that the request has failed. The Result-Code AVP values defined in
Diameter Base Protocol IETF RFC 3588 [7] are applied. As an addition the
following Result-Code AVP value defined in IETF RFC 4006 [5] is applicable:
DIAMETER_USER_UNKNOWN (5030):
This error shall be used by the PCRF to indicate to the RCAF that the end user
specified in the request is unknown to the PCRF, or it shall be used by the
RCAF to indicate to the PCRF that the end user specified in the request is
unknown to the RCAF. This result code does not apply for aggregated RUCI
report.
### 5.5.4 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the Transient Failures category are used to inform a
peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but
may be able to satisfy the request in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base RFC 3588 [7] are
applicable. As an addition the following Experimental-Result-Code value
defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [14] is applicable:
DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION (4144):
This error shall be used when a node receives an incoming request for a
specific user id and PDN ID while it has an ongoing transaction for the same
