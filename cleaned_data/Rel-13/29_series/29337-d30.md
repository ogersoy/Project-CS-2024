# 4 General Description
The T4 reference point between the MTC-IWF and the SMS-SC is an intra PLMN
interface, as defined in the 3GPP TS 23.682 [7].
This document describes the T4 interface related procedures, message
parameters and protocol specifications.
The T4 interface allows transfer of device trigger from MTC-IWF to SMS-SC
inside HPLMN domain, along with the serving SGSN/MME/MSC identities, and
allows SMS-SC to report to MTC-IWF the submission outcome of a device trigger
and the success or failure of delivering the device trigger to the UE.
# 5 MTC-IWF -- SMS-SC (T4)
## 5.1 Introduction
This section describes the Diameter-based T4 interface related procedures and
information elements exchanged between the MTC-IWF and the SMS-SC.
In the tables that describe the Information Elements transported by each
Diameter command, each Information Element is marked as (M) Mandatory, (C)
Conditional or (O) Optional in the \"Cat.\" column. For the correct handling
of the Information Element according to the category type, see the description
detailed in section 6 of the 3GPP TS 29.228 [7].

#### 5.2.1.2 Detailed Behaviour of the MTC-IWF
The MTC-IWF shall make use of this procedure to transfer device trigger
request received over Tsp interface from SCS to the SMS-SC.
If the MTC-IWF retrieved the IMSI and serving node identities of the UE from
the HSS, the MTC-IWF shall include these identities in the request to the SMS-
SC.
The MTC-IWF shall include the External Identifier of the UE if received over
Tsp interface from SCS.
The MTC-IWF shall include the Old Trigger Reference Number if received over
Tsp interface from SCS.
#### 5.2.1.3 Detailed Behaviour of the SMS-SC
When receiving a Device Trigger Request, the SMS-SC shall check the identity
of the UE received (i.e. IMSI or MSISDN) if it serves this UE. If not, a
Result Code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be returned.
If the SM-RP-SMEA AVP contains an invalid SME address, the SMS-SC shall return
a Result Code of DIAMETER_ERROR_INVALID_SME_ADDRESS.
If the SMS-SC cannot fulfil the received request due to congestion, it shall
return a Result Code of DIAMETER_ERROR_SC_CONGESTION.
If there are routing information (i.e. MSC or MME, SGSN, IP-SM-GW identities
serving the UE for SMS) present in the request, the SMS-SC shall use the
information for delivery of device trigger request for the UE. The SMS-SC
shall return a Result Code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS to the MTC-IWF.
NOTE: If the IP-SM-GW address is received, the SMS-SC uses the IP-SM-GW as the
serving node with highest priority for delivery of device trigger request for
the UE.
If there is no routing information (i.e. MSC or MME, SGSN, IP-SM-GW identities
serving the UE for SMS) present in the request, the SMS-SC shall send a
Report-SM-Delivery-Status message to the HLR in order to update the MWD in the
HLR (see 3GPP TS 23.040 [9]).
If Trigger-Action is received from the MTC-IWF and set to TRIGGER (0), SMS-SC
shall store the new trigger message received from MTC-IWF.
If Trigger-Action is received from the MTC-IWF and set to RECALL (1), SMS-SC
checks if message corresponding to Reference-Number is pending. If trigger
message is pending then SMS-SC deletes the old trigger message. The SMS-SC
shall return Old-Reference-Number and a Result Code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS to the
MTC-IWF. For the successful scenario the SMS-SC is not required to initiate a
device trigger reporting to the device trigger of Old-Reference-Number. If
trigger message is not pending then SMS-SC shall return a Result Code of
DIAMETER_ERROR_ORIGINAL_MESSAGE_NOT_PENDING to the MTC-IWF.
If Trigger-Action is received from the MTC-IWF and set to REPLACE (2), SMS-SC
checks if message corresponding to Old-Reference-Number is pending. If trigger
message is pending then SMS-SC shall delete the old trigger message and store
the new trigger message received from MTC-IWF. The SMS-SC shall return OLD-
Reference-Number and a Result Code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS to the MTC-IWF. For the
successful scenario the SMS-SC is not required to initiate a device trigger
reporting to the device trigger of Old-Reference-Number. If trigger message is
not pending then SMS-SC shall return OLD-Reference-Number and a Result Code of
DIAMETER_ERROR_ORIGINAL_MESSAGE_NOT_PENDING to the MTC-IWF and shall interpret
the trigger replace message as a new device trigger. If the SMS-SC fails to
perform deletion of the old trigger or fails to store the new trigger, it
shall not delete the old trigger and shall not store the new trigger and shall
return result code of DIAMETER_ERROR_TRIGGER_REPLACE_FAILURE.
The SMS SC shall use the most appropriate cause code indicating the real
reason for the unsuccessful handling of the request message.
If the SMS-SC cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not stated in the
above steps, e.g. due to system failure, it shall stop processing the request
and set Result-Code to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
### 5.2.2 Delivery Report of Device Trigger
#### 5.2.2.1 General
This procedure shall be used between the SMS-SC and the MTC-IWF for Delivery
Report of Device Trigger. The procedure shall be invoked by the SMS-SC and is
used:
\- to report the success or failure of delivering the device trigger to the
UE.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Delivery-Report-Request/Answer in the
Diameter application specified in chapter 6. Tables 5.2.2.1/1 and 5.2.2.1/2
detail the involved information elements.

Between the MTC-IWF and the SMS-SC, Diameter sessions shall be implicitly
terminated. An implicitly terminated session is one for which the server does
not maintain state information. The client shall not send any re-authorization
or session termination requests to the server.
The Diameter base protocol includes the Auth-Session-State AVP as the
mechanism for the implementation of implicitly terminated sessions.
The client (server) shall include in its requests (responses) the Auth-
Session-State AVP set to the value NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1), as described in
IETF RFC 3588 [3]. As a consequence, the server shall not maintain any state
information about this session and the client shall not send any session
termination request. Neither the Authorization-Lifetime AVP nor the Session-
Timeout AVP shall be present in requests or responses.
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc493496465 .anchor}6.1.5 Transport Protocol
Diameter messages over the T4 interface shall make use of SCTP, see IETF RFC
4960 [5].
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc493496466 .anchor}6.1.6 Routing Considerations
This clause specifies the use of the Diameter routing AVPs Destination-Realm
and Destination-Host.
The T4 reference point is defined as an intra-operator interface, and both
MTC-IWF and the SMS-SC are located in the same network domain. If the MTC-IWF
knows the address/name of the SMS-SC for a certain user, both the Destination-
Realm and Destination-Host AVPs shall be present in the request. Otherwise,
the Destination-Realm AVP shall be present and the command shall be routed to
the next Diameter node. Consequently, the Destination-Host AVP is declared as
optional in the ABNF for all requests initiated by the MTC-IWF.
The SMS-SC obtains the Destination-Host AVP to use in requests towards the
MTC-IWF, from the Origin-Host AVP received in previous requests from the MTC-
IWF. Consequently, the Destination-Host AVP is declared as mandatory in the
ABNF for all requests initiated by the SMS-SC.
If the Vendor-Specific-Application-ID AVP is received in any of the commands,
it may be ignored by the receiving node, and it shall not be used for routing
purposes.
NOTE: The Vendor-Specific-Application-ID can be included as an optional AVP in
all commands in order to ensure interoperability with diameter agents
following a strict implementation of IETF RFC 3588 [3], by which messages not
including this AVP will be rejected. IETF RFC 3588 [3] indicates that the AVP
shall be present in all proxiable commands, such as those defined in this
specification, despite the fact that the contents of this AVP are redundant
since the Application ID is already present in the command header. This AVP
may be removed in subsequent revisions of this specification, once the
diameter base protocol is updated accordingly.
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc493496467 .anchor}6.1.7 Advertising Application Support
The MTC-IWF and SMS-SC shall advertise support of the Diameter T4 Application
by including the value of the application identifier in the Auth-Application-
Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id grouped AVP of the
Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.
The vendor identifier value of 3GPP (10415) shall be included in the
Supported-Vendor-Id AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands, and in the Vendor-Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id grouped AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.
The Vendor-Id AVP included in Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands that is not included in the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVPs as described above shall indicate the manufacturer of the
Diameter node as per IETF RFC 3588 [3].
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc493496468 .anchor}6.1.8 Diameter Application Identifier
The T4 interface protocol shall be defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter
application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA
to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the T4 interface application
is 16777311 (allocated by IANA).
### 6.1.9 Use of the Supported-Features AVP
When new functionality is introduced on the T4 interface, it should be defined
as optional. If backwards incompatible changes cannot be avoided, the new
functionality shall be introduced as a new feature and support advertised with
the Supported-Features AVP. The usage of the Supported-Features AVP on the T4
interface is consistent with the procedures for the dynamic discovery of
supported features as defined in clause 7.2 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [6].
When extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs
shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined mandatory in the
command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [6], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the all reference points as specified in this specification, the Supported-
Features AVP is used to identify features that have been defined by 3GPP and
hence, for features defined in this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain
the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415). If there are multiple feature lists defined for
the reference point, the Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists
from one another.
The Table 6.3.5 defines the features applicable to the T4 reference point for
the feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.
## 6.2 Commands
### 6.2.1 Introduction
This section defines the Command code values and related ABNF for each command
described in this specification.
### 6.2.2 Command-Code Values
This section defines Command-Code values for the T4 interface application as
allocated by IANA.
Every command is defined by means of the ABNF syntax IETF RFC 5234 [10],
according to the rules in IETF RFC 3588 [3]. In the case, the definition and
use of an AVP is not specified in this document, the guidelines in IETF RFC
3588 [3] shall apply.
The following Command Codes are defined in this specification:

### 6.3.6 Trigger-Action
The Trigger Action AVP is of type Unsigned32 and indicates the type of the
device trigger. The following values are defined:
> TRIGGER (0)
This value is used when device trigger requests the storage and sending of a
new device trigger.
> RECALL (1)
This value is used when device trigger requests the removal of a pending
device trigger.
> REPLACE (2)
This value is used when device trigger requests the replacement of a pending
device trigger.
### 6.3.7 MTC-Error-Diagnostic
The MTC-Error-Diagnostic AVP is of type Unsigned32. The following values are
defined:
\- ORIGINAL_MESSAGE_NOT_DELETED (0)
> This cause should be sent if the replace failed due to the fact that the old
> message is pending but could not be deleted in the SMS-SC.
>
> \- NEW_MESSAGE_NOT_STORED (1)
>
> This cause should be sent if the replace failed due to the fact that the new
> message could not be stored in the SMS-SC e.g. no resource available.
### 6.3.8 DRMP
The DRMP AVP is of type Enumerated and it is defined in IETF RFC 7944 [18].
This AVP allows the SMS-SC and the MTC-IWF to indicate the relative priority
of Diameter messages.
# 7 Result-Code and Experimental-Result Values
## 7.1 General
This section defines result code values that shall be supported by all
Diameter implementations that conform to this specification.
## 7.2 Success
Result codes that fall within the Success category shall be used to inform a
peer that a request has been successfully completed. The Result-Code AVP
values defined in Diameter Base Protocol IETF RFC 3588 [3] shall be applied.
## 7.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request has failed, and should not be attempted
again. The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base Protocol IETF RFC
3588 [3] shall be applied. When one of the result codes defined here is
included in a response, it shall be inside an Experimental-Result AVP and the
Result-Code AVP shall be absent.
### 7.3.1 DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN (5001)
This result code shall be sent by the SMS-SC to indicate that the user
identified by the IMSI or the MSISDN is unknown.
### 7.3.2 DIAMETER_ERROR_INVALID_SME_ADDRESS (5530)
This result code shall be sent by the SMS-SC to indicate that the SME address
is invalid.
### 7.3.3 DIAMETER_ERROR_SC_CONGESTION (5531)
This result code shall be sent by the SMS-SC to indicate that SC is congested
and unable to deliver the device trigger request.
### 7.3.4 Void
### 7.3.5 DIAMETER_ERROR_TRIGGER_REPLACE_FAILURE (5533)
This result code shall be sent by the SMS-SC to indicate that trigger replace
has failed to delete the old message and/or to store the new message.
### 7.3.6 DIAMETER_ERROR_TRIGGER_RECALL_FAILURE (5534)
This result code shall be sent by the SMS-SC to indicate that trigger recall
has failed.
### 7.3.7 DIAMETER_ERROR_ORIGINAL_MESSAGE_NOT_PENDING (5535)
This result code shall be sent by the SMS-SC to indicate that trigger recall
or replace has failed because the original message to be recalled or replaced
is not stored any more in the SMS-SC.
###### ## Annex A (normative):**** Diameter message priority mechanism
## A.1 General
IETF RFC 7944 [18] specifies a Diameter routing message priority mechanism
that allows Diameter nodes to indicate the relative priority of Diameter
messages. With this information, other Diameter nodes may leverage the
relative priority of Diameter messages into routing, resource allocation and
also abatement decisions when overload control is applied.
## A.2 T4 interface
### A.2.1 General
The Diameter message priority mechanism is an optional feature.
### A.2.2 SMS-SC and MTC-IWF behaviour
When the SMS-SC or the MTC-IWF support the Diameter message priority mechanism
over the T4 interface, the SMS-SC or the MTC-IWF shall comply with IETF RFC
7944 [18].
The SMS-SC or the MTC-IWF sending a request shall determine the required
priority according to its policies. When priority is required, the SMS-SC or
the MTC-IWF shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level
in the request it sends, and shall prioritise the request according to the
required priority level.
When the SMS-SC or the MTC-IWF receives the corresponding response, it shall
prioritise the received response according to the priority level received
within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according to the
priority level of the corresponding request.
When the SMS-SC or the MTC-IWF receives a request, it shall handle the request
according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, the SMS-
SC or the MTC-IWF may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP
according to its policies and shall handle the response according to the
required priority level. If the required priority level is different from the
priority level received in the request, the SMS-SC or the MTC-IWF shall
include the DRMP AVP in the response.
The SMS-SC and MTC-IWF decisions for a required priority and for the priority
level value are implementation specific.
Diameter requests related to high priority traffic shall contain a DRMP AVP
with a high priority of which the level value is operator dependent.
If the SMS-SC supporting the Diameter message priority mechanism receives a
request message containing both the Priority-Indication AVP and the DRMP AVP,
the SMS-SC shall prioritize the request according to priority level received
within the DRMP AVP.
