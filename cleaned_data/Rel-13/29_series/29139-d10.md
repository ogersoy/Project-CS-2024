# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the H(e)NB -- SeGW interface. The interface is
used for the interworking between a 3GPP system and a Fixed Broadband Access
network defined by Broadband Forum. The interworking procedure provides the IP
connectivity to a 3GPP UE using a H(e)NB connected to a Fixed Broadband Access
network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.139 [2].
The specification covers the QoS aspects and Tunnel management procedures.

# 5 Supporting QoS
## 5.1 General
At interworking with a Fixed Broadband Access network, QoS is provided by DSCP
marking as specified in IETF RFC 2474 [4].
## 5.2 H(e)NB procedures
### 5.2.1 General
The H(e)NB shall support DSCP marking on the IPsec header when forwarding the
UE uplink traffic.
Based on H(e)NB configuration either the QCI mapping or the Reflective QoS may
be used.
### 5.2.2 QCI mapping
The QCI mapping table contains a one-to-one mapping from QCI value to DSCP
marking value. The QCI mapping table is configured in the H(e)NB by the
operator.
When forwarding an uplink IP packet, the H(e)NB shall perform a lookup in the
QCI mapping table based on the QCI value of the EPS bearer/PDP context before
the IPsec tunnel encapsulation. The H(e)NB shall set the DSCP marking value of
the IPsec header according to the matched QCI mapping table entry.
### 5.2.3 Reflective QoS
To support the H(e)NB Reflective QoS function for uplink traffic, the H(e)NB
shall create and maintain the uplink DSCP marking rules for each active PDN
connection as specified for UE Reflective QoS function in 3GPP TS 24.139 [3].
When forwarding an uplink IP packet, the H(e)NB shall perform a lookup in the
DSCP marking table based on the n-tuple of the IP header before the IPsec
tunnel encapsulation. If a matching entry is found, the H(e)NB shall set the
DSCP marking value of the IPsec header according to the matched DSCP marking
rule. If no matching entry is found, the H(e)NB shall copy the DSCP field of
the outer IP header into the IPsec header before forwarding to the SeGW.
## 5.3 SeGW procedures
When receiving a downlink data packet, the SeGW shall copy the DSCP marking
value from the outer IP header into the IPsec header before forwarding to the
H(e)NB using the IPsec tunnel, as specified in 3GPP TR 23.139 [2].
# 6 Tunnel Management
## 6.1 General
The tunnel is an IPsec tunnel established via an IKEv2 protocol exchange IETF
RFC 5996 [5] between the H(e)NB and the SeGW which is through the Fixed
Broadband Access Network.
**In an IPv4 Fixed** Broadband Access **Network, NAT can be deployed between
the H(e)NB and the SeGW, e.g.** in a Residence Gateway**. A H(e)NB behind the
NAT shall invoke the NAT traversal procedure for IKEv2. The IPsec tunnel is
encapsulated over UDP in the Tunnel-Mode as specified in IETF RFC 5996 [5].**
## 6.2 H(e)NB procedures
### 6.2.1 Tunnel establishment
#### 6.2.1.1 IP address allocation
**The SeGW shall provide the IP address to the H(e)NB for the communication
with the EPC network.**
**For dynamic IP address allocation,** the H(e)NB shall include the requested
IP address type (IPv4 address or IPv6 address) that needs to be configured in
an IKEv2 CFG_REQUEST Configuration Payload in the IKE_AUTH request message as
defined in IETF RFC 5996 [5] after reception of the IKE_SA_INIT response from
the SeGW.
#### 6.2.1.2 NAT Traversal
**NAT can be deployed in an IPv4 Fixed** Broadband Access **Network. IKEv2 NAT
Traversal specified in section 2.23 of IETF RFC 5996 [5] shall be supported by
H(e)NB.**
**If NAT is detected between the H(e)NB and SeGW, the following procedures
shall be performed:**
\- UDP-Encapsulated ESP as defined in IETF RFC 5996 [5];
\- sending the NAT-keepalive packet to keep NAT mapping alive if no other
packet to the SeGW has been sent in M seconds as defined in the IETF RFC 3948
[6];
NOTE: M is a locally configurable parameter with a default value of 20 seconds
as defined in the IETF RFC 3948 [6].
#### 6.2.1.3 H(e)NB NATed Tunnel-IP address discovery
**If NAT is detected between the H(e)NB and SeGW,** the H(e)NB shall request
the SeGW to return the H(e)NB local IP address information by including the
EXTERNAL_SOURCE_IP4_NAT_INFO attribute as defined in subclause 7.1.1.1 in the
CFG_REQUEST Configuration Payload within the IKE_AUTH request message**. The
length field of the attribute shall be set to zero. The NATed IPv4 Address
field and UDP Port number field shall be absent.**
If the H(e)NB subsequently receives the EXTERNAL_SOURCE_IP4_NAT_INFO attribute
**in the CFG_REPLY configuration payload** from the SeGW, the H(e)NB shall
report the IP address received in EXTERNAL_SOURCE_IP4_NAT_INFO attribute as
the H(e)NB local IP address to the MME/SGSN.
### 6.2.2 Tunnel modification
NAT mappings can change when the UDP port number is reassigned by the NAT,
and/or H(e)NB local IP address is reallocated due to NAT restart.
Upon NAT remapping, the SeGW initiates the tunnel disconnection procedure as
specified in subclause 6.3.3. Then the H(e)NB shall re-initiate the tunnel
establishment procedure as specified in sub-clause 6.2.1.
### 6.2.3 Tunnel disconnection
The H(e)NB shall use the procedures defined in IETF RFC 5996 [5] to disconnect
an IPsec tunnel to the SeGW.
## 6.3 SeGW procedures
### 6.3.1 Tunnel establishment
#### 6.3.1.1 IP address allocation
For dynamic IP address allocation, upon receipt of an IKE_AUTH request message
from the H(e)NB requesting the IP address, the SeGW shall include the remote
IP address information in the IKEv2 Configuration Payload (CFG_REPLY) of the
final IKE_AUTH response message to the H(e)NB. The SeGW shall assign either an
IPv4 or an IPv6 address to the H(e)NB via a single CFG_REPLY Configuration
Payload.
#### 6.3.1.2 NAT Traversal
**NAT can be deployed in an IPv4 Fixed** Broadband Access **Network. IKEv2 NAT
Traversal specified in section 2.23 of IETF RFC 5996 [5] shall be supported by
SeGW.**
**If NAT is detected between the H(e)NB and SeGW,** the SeGW shall use UDP-
Encapsulated ESP as defined in **IETF RFC 5996 [5]**.
#### 6.3.1.3 H(e)NB NATed Tunnel-IP address discovery
**If the SeGW receives the EXTERNAL_SOURCE_IP4_NAT_INFO attribute** as defined
in subclause 7.1.1.1 **in the CFG_REQUEST configuration payload within
IKE_AUTH request message, the SeGW shall provide the H(e)NB local IP address
information (i.e. NATed IPv4 address and UDP port number) to the H(e)NB by
including the EXTERNAL_SOURCE_IP4_NAT_INFO attribute in the CFG_REPLY
configuration payload within the IKE_AUTH response message.**
### 6.3.2 Tunnel modification
NAT mappings can change when the UDP port number is reassigned by the NAT,
and/or H(e)NB local IP address is reallocated due to NAT restart.
If NAT remapping is detected by the SeGW, the SeGW shall initiate the tunnel
disconnection procedure (see subclause 6.3.3).
> NOTE: No procedures are defined in current release of specification to
> enable the SeGW to send the modified H(e)NB local IP address information to
> the H(e)NB during the lifetime of IKEv2 security association.
### 6.3.3 Tunnel disconnection
The SeGW shall use the procedures defined in IETF RFC 5996 [5] to disconnect
an IPsec tunnel to the H(e)NB.
