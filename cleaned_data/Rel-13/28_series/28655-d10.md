The present document specifies the GERAN Network Resource Model (NRM) that can
be communicated between an IRPAgent and IRPManagers for telecommunication
network management purposes, including management of converged networks.
This document specifies the semantics and behaviour of class attributes and
relations visible across the reference point in a protocol and technology
neutral way. It does not define their syntax and encoding.

### 4.2.1 Relationships
This clause depicts the set of classes that encapsulate information relevant
for this service. This clause provides the overview of all classes in UML.
Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of various aspects of
these classes.
The figures below show the containment/naming hierarchy and the associations
of the GERAN NRM.
{width="6.694444444444445in" height="4.4375in"}
NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers represent transient as well as steady-
state numbers, and reflect all managed object creation and deletion scenarios.
NOTE 2: The ExternalBSSFunction is used in the Core Network NRM.
Figure 4.2.1-1: GERAN NRM Containment/Naming and Association diagram
Each Managed Object is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to
3GPP TS 32.300 [13] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example,
the DN of an IOC representing a cell could have a format like:
> SubNetwork =Sweden, MeContext =MEC-Gbg-1, ManagedElement =RNC-Gbg-1,
> BSSFunction=BSS1.
{width="5.770833333333333in" height="1.2604166666666667in"}
NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers represent transient as well as steady-
state numbers, and reflect all managed object creation and deletion scenarios.
NOTE 2: Each instance of the VsDataContainer shall only be contained under one
IOC. The VsDataContainer can be contained under IOCs defined in other NRMs.
Figure 4.2.1-2: GERAN NRM Containment/Naming and Association diagram
The VsDataContainer is only used for the Bulk CM IRP.
### 4.2.2 Inheritance
This clause depicts the inheritance relationships that exist between IOCs.
Figure 4.2.2-1 shows the inheritance hierarchy for the GERAN NRM.

### 4.3.4 GSMRelation
#### 4.3.4.1 Definition
This IOC contains a Neighbour cell Relation (NR) from a source cell to a
target cell, where the target cell is a GSMCell or ExternalGSMCell instance.
NOTE: In handover relation terms, the cell containing the GSMRelation object
is the source cell for the handover. The cell referred to in the GSMRelation
object is the target cell for the handover. This defines a one-way handover
relation where the direction is _from_ source cell _to_ target cell.
The source cell can be a GSMCell instance. This is the case for an Intra-GERAN
NR.
The source cell can be a UTRANGenericCell instance. This is the case for
Inter-RAT NR from UTRAN to GERAN. See 3GPP TS 28.652 [9].
The source cell can be an EUTRANGenericCell instance. This is the case for
Inter-RAT NR from E-UTRAN to GERAN. See 3GPP TS 28.658 [10].
