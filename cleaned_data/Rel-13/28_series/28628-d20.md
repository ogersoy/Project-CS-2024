# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
28.627: Self-Organizing Networks (SON) Policy Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements

# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
Self Organizing Networks (SON) Policy Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP,
through which an IRPAgent can communicate management information to one or
several IRPManagers concerning SON policies. The SON policy NRM IRP comprises
a set of specifications defining Requirements, a protocol neutral Information
Service and one or more Solution Set(s).
The present document specifies the protocol neutral SON policy NRM IRP:
Information Service (IS).
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface IRP such
as the \"Basic CM IRP\" is needed (3GPP TS 32.602 [11]). However, which
Interface IRP is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.
The present document also contains stage 2 descriptions for those
functionalities for the Self-**Optimization OAM, SON coordination and Energy
Saving Management**.

### 4.3.3 Optimization Method
#### 4.3.3.1 Problem Detection
HO Parameter Optimization Function shall focus on detecting the problem
scenarios described in TS 28.627 [5]; namely: too early handovers, too late
handovers and inefficient use of NW resources due to HOs. For more information
about these scenarios see TS 28.627 [5] section 6.1.3.
The following inputs may be used for the identification of the problem
scenarios:
\- Event capture and analysis
\- UE measurements
\- Performance measurements
In event capture and analysis, the eNodeB exploits event information
associated with a UE context, such as evidence of previous handovers (UE
History, see TS 36.423 [7]) and HO failure details (such as in which cell the
handover failed and where the UE re-established the connection).
UE measurements are sent within UE measurement reports and they may indicate
whether HOs are too early or too late.
HO-related performance measurements (PMs) collected at the source and / or
target eNB can be useful in detecting HO-related issues on the cell level.
Since the impact of incorrect HO parameter setting will also be on the cell-
level, PMs can provide useful information that can be used to detect and
resolve HO-related issues due to incorrect parameter settings.
#### 4.3.3.2 Problem Solution
HO Parameter Optimization Function will aim at optimizing the HO parameters
listed in Section 4.3.2 in such way to mitigate the problem scenarios
discussed in Section 4.3.3.1. The optimization algorithms will not be
specified. The exact set of HO parameters that may be adjusted by the
algorithms is dictated by the choice of triggered HO measurements made by the
RRM entity in an eNodeB.
### 4.3.4 Architecture
#### 4.3.4.1 Definition of Logical Functions
**HO Parameter Optimization Monitor Function:** This function is used for
monitoring the handover parameter optimization (e.g. monitoring related
performance counters or alarms).
**HO Parameter Optimization Policy Control Function:** This function is used
for configuring the handover parameter optimization policies.
#### 4.3.4.2 Location of Logical Functions
For HandOver (HO) parameter optimization there are several options for the
location of the SON algorithm:
  1. The SON algorithm is located in the eNB(s).
  2. The SON algorithm is located in the EM, the parameter changes are executed in the eNBs.
An example for the first option is shown in figure 4.3.4.2:
Figure 4.3.4.2: Example when the SON algorithm is located in the eNB(s)
The detailed SON functionalities in eNB are out of scope of this
specification.
### 4.3.5 PM
IRPManager shall collect HO-related performance measurements from the source
and / or target eNB which can be useful in detecting HO-related issues on the
cell level. The following input can be used for the identification of the
problem scenarios specified:
The number of RLF event happened within an interval after handover success.
The number of unnecessary handovers to another RAT without RLF.
Performance Measurements related to handover failure are captured in the table
below.
The Performance Measurements are for outgoing handovers. Further, they should
be available on a cell relation basis.
* * *
Performance measurement name Description Related targets Number of handover
events Includes successful handovers plus all identified failures Rate of
failures related to handover Number of HO failures All failure cases Rate of
failures related to handover Number of too early HO failures Too early HO
failure cases Rate of failures related to handover Number of too late HO
failures Too late HO failure cases Rate of failures related to handover Number
of HO failures to wrong cell HO failures to wrong cell Rate of failures
related to handover Number of unnecessary HOs to another RAT Unnecessary HOs
to each of different RATs

NOTE: The monitoring of performance measurements will make use of existing PM
IRP.
## 4.4 Interference Control Function
## 4.5 Capacity and Coverage Optimization Function
4.5.1 Objective and Targets
The objective of capacity and coverage optimization is to provide optimal
coverage and capacity for the radio network. A tradeoff between capacity and
coverage needs to be considered.
The detailed target(s) FFS.
4.5.2 Parameters to be optimized
To reach capacity and coverage optimization targets, the following parameters
may be optimized:
  * Downlink transmit power
  * Antenna tilt
  * Antenna azimuth
4.5.3 Optimization Method
4.5.3.1 Problem Detection
The main symptoms of capacity and coverage optimization problems (see TS
37.320 [15]) are:
**Coverage hole:** A coverage hole is an area where the pilot signal strength
is below a threshold which is required by a UE to access the network, or the
SINRs of both serving and neighbor cells is below a level needed to maintain
the basic service. Coverage holes are usually caused by physical obstructions
such as new buildings, hills, or by unsuitable antenna parameters, or just
inadequate RF planning. UEs around coverage hole will suffer from call drop
and radio link failure. Typical phenomenon of coverage hole is either HO
failure happens frequently and cannot be optimized by HO parameter
optimization or call drop happens frequently and cannot be rescued by RRC re-
establishment.
**Weak coverage:** Weak coverage occurs when the pilot signal strength or the
SNR (or SINR) of serving cell is below the level needed to maintain a planned
performance requirement (e.g. cell edge bit-rate).
**Pilot pollution:** In areas where coverage of different cells overlap a lot,
interference levels are high, power levels are high, energy consumption is
high and cell performance may be low. Typically in this situation UEs may
experience high SNR to more than one cell and high interference levels.
**Overshoot coverage:** Overshoot occurs when coverage of a cell reaches far
beyond what is planned. It can occur as an "island" of coverage in the
interior of another cell, which may not be a direct neighbor. Reasons for
overshoot may be reflections in buildings or across open water, lakes etc. UEs
in this area may suffer call drops or high interference.
**DL and UL channel coverage mismatch:** DL channel coverage is larger than UL
channel coverage is one typical scenario of DL and UL channel coverage
mismatch. The UE will suffer UL problems when it moves into the mismatch area.
In a realistic network, these symptoms may be tolerated to a certain level.
These symptoms may indicate a real problem when combined with other factors
such as frequency of symptoms, duration of symptoms, or affected population.
The following inputs may be used for the identification of the problem
scenarios:
\- UE measurements
\- Performance measurements
\- Alarms, other monitoring information e.g. trace data
UE measurements are sent within UE measurement reports and they may indicate
the capacity and coverage problem.
Capacity and coverage related performance measurements collected at the source
and / or target eNB can be useful in detecting capacity and coverage related
issues on the cell level. Minimizing Driver Test (MDT) or HO-related
performance measurements may be used also in detecting capacity and coverage
related issues on the cell level.
Alarms, other monitoring information e.g. trace data can be correlated to get
an unambiguous indication of capacity and coverage problem.
4.5.3.2 Problem Solution
Capacity and coverage optimization function will aim at optimizing the
parameters listed in Section 4.5.2 in such way to mitigate the problem
scenarios discussed in Section 4.5.3.1.
### 4.5.4 Architecture
#### 4.5.4.1 Definition of Logical Functions
**CCO Monitor Function:** This function is used for monitoring the capacity
and coverage optimization (e.g. monitoring related performance counters, UE
measurements or alarms).
**CCO Policy Control Function:** This function is used for configuring the
capacity and coverage optimization policies.
#### 4.5.4.2 Location of Logical Functions
For capacity and coverage optimization (CCO), there are several options for
the location of the centralized CCO SON algorithm:
1) The CCO SON algorithm is located in the DM. The capacity and coverage
optimization decision is made by the DM centralized CCO algorithm.
2) The CCO SON algorithm is located in the NM. The capacity and coverage
optimization decision is made by the NM centralized CCO algorithm.
An example for the first option is shown in figure 4.5.4.2-1:
Figure 4.5.4.2-1: Example when the CCO SON algorithm is located in DM
An example for the second option is shown in figure 4.5.4.2-2:
Figure 4.5.4.2-2: Example when the CCO SON algorithm is located in NM
The detailed CCO SON algorithm in OAM (NM centralized or EM centralized) is
out of scope of this specification.
4.5.5 PM
The IRPAgent shall support a capability allowing the IRPManager to collect CCO
related performance measurements to know the situation of coverage or
interference which may then trigger corresponding optimization procedures.
Performance measurements related with CCO are captured in the tables 4.5.5-1
(E-UTRAN) and 4.5.5-2 (UTRAN) below:

## 4.7 SON coordination
### 4.7.1 Introduction
There may be conflicts or dependencies between SON functions; SON coordination
means preventing or resolving conflicts or negative influences between SON
functions to make SON functions comply with operator's policy.
As the example shown in figure 4.7.1.1, there is mesh relationship between SON
functions and network parameters (or network elements) in which conflicts or
negative influences may happen if no SON coordination.
Figure 4.7.1.1: Mesh relationship between SON functions and network parameters
(or network elements)
### 4.7.2 Coordination between **SON functions below Itf-N and non-SON CM
operations over itf-N**
#### 4.7.2.1 Description
Conflict may arise between non-SON CM operation via Itf-N and the SON
functions (in particularly self-optimization function) below Itf-N in the
following scenario.
The network parameters can be changed by the non-SON CM operations via
Itf-N,meanwhile, the SON functions below Itf-N may also require changing the
parameters. If these parameters are some (same or associated) parameters of
some (same or associated) nodes which will be changed by the non-SON CM
operations and the SON functions below Itf-N, conflict arises. (Conflict see
clause 4 of 28.627[5])
For example, the non-SON CM operation via Itf-N may try to reduce the CIO
(cell individual offset) parameter, it makes the HO trigger between cells
(e.g., HO from cell A to cell B) become more difficult. But in the meanwhile,
the SON function MRO may try to increase the CIO parameter, it makes the HO
easier. In this case, if the conflict is not coordinated, the parameter may be
modified twice. Then the failed rate related with handover may rise or ping-
pong handover may arise between the two cells.
In case the SON function below Itf-N and non-SON CM operation via Itf-N has
conflict, the SON function below Itf-N shall take into account and re-
evaluate, if applicable, any non-SON CM operation changes via Itf-N.
As showing in the following example, At Time T3, after Non-SON operation has
finished the modification, SON function below Itf-N shall take the non-SON CM
operation changes into account for further SON analysis.
{width="3.1875in" height="2.872916666666667in"}
#### 4.7.2.2 Prevention
In a real network, it is possible that non-SON CM operations via Itf-N and
several SON functions below Itf-N are running at the same time, and they may
try to change the same or associated parameters during a short time period. So
coordination is needed to prevent this kind of conflicts.
#### 4.7.2.3 Resolution
Refer to common coordination solutions part.
### 4.7.3 Coordination between different SON functions
#### 4.7.3.0 General
NOTE: The coordination between different SON functions should be decided case
by case.
#### 4.7.3.1 Coordination between Cell Outage Compensation and Energy Saving
Management
##### 4.7.3.1.1 Description
A conflict could arise between energy saving and cell outage compensation in
the following scenario.
One or more candidate cells are configured to possibly take coverage of the
original cell. The original cell is in energySaving state or is about to enter
energySaving state. One or more candidate cells go into outage with the
consequence that coverage of the original cell can not be provided any more.
##### 4.7.3.1.2 Prevention
Prevention is hardly possible, except making the cells as outage proof as
possible. But cell outages can happen even to the most stable cell in a
network.
##### 4.7.3.1.3 Resolution
If the original cell is in energySaving state, it shall leave energySaving
state.
If the original cell is about to enter energySaving state, it shall not go
into energySaving state until candidate cell outage is recovered and candidate
cell is able to provide the coverage.
The original cell may go into the energySaving state after the candidate cell
outage is recovered and coverage of the original cell can be taken over by
candidate cell again.
#### 4.7.3.2 Coordination among Cell Outage Compensation, Capacity and
Coverage Optimization, and Energy Saving Management
##### 4.7.3.2.1 Description
Capacity and Coverage Optimization (CCO), Cell Outage Compensation (COC) and
Energy Saving Management (ESM) may require changes to the coverage and/or
capacity of one or more cells during the same time period, which could lead to
the following issue:
**Figure 4.7.3.2 Coordination among COC, CCO, and ESM**
Figure 4.7.3.2 is a typical scenario for the coordination among COC, CCO and
ESM.
Cell 1 is detected in outage, COC will try to compensate the outage Cell 1 by
reconfiguring the RF configuration of some compensation candidate cells, e.g.,
TX power, antenna tilt and antenna azimuth of Cell 2 and Cell 3.
Before the outage Cell 1 is compensated, CCO may detect the degrading of
coverage related KPI (e.g., success rate of RRC connection establishments,
cell throughput) of Cell 1 and its neighbour cells (Cell 2 and other blue
cells) and make a conclusion that there is a coverage problem in this KPI
degraded area.
Meanwhile, ESM is operating on Cell 2 to compensate the coverage of its
neighboring cell (Cell 4) which is going into energySaving state.
From the time point at which the outage Cell 1 is detected until Cell 1 has
been compensated by Cell 2 and Cell 3, during this period, if there is no
coordination among COC, CCO and ESM, there will be possibly different settings
for adjusting TX power, antenna tilt and antenna azimuth of Cell 2 for COC,
CCO or ESM purposes respectively. It's most likely that the adjustment from
COC, ESM and optimization from CCO may conflict in the common affected outage
compensation candidate cell(s) (Cell 2 in the above example).
It is also possible that ESM is operating on Cell 2 to compensate the coverage
of Cell 4 that is in energySaving state, while COC detects that Cell 1 has
outage, and requests Cell 2 to compensate the coverage of Cell 1. COC and ESM
need to be coordinated to determine if this request can be accepted.
After the outage cell comes back to normal, the COC exits the coordination
scenario, while CCO and ESM continute to work and need to be well coordinated.
For example, CCO may adjust the antenna tilt of Cell 2 in a downward direction
to improve the coverage signal quality, but ESM may adjust the antenna tilt of
Cell 2 in an opposite direction to enlarge its coverage area for purpose of ES
compensation. Therefore, coordination should be continued between CCO and ESM
to resolve the possible configuration conflict on Cell 2.
Other conflict scenarios could be:
Cell A is compensating **_to provide coverage for Cell B that is in_**
energySaving state. COC detects that Cell A has outage. Since Cell A is not
able to provide the coverage for Cell B any more, Cell B needs to be covered
by another cell, or to deactivate energy saving.
Cell A is in energySaving state. COC detects Cell B has outage, and requests
Cell A to compensate the coverage of Cell B. Cell A may need to terminate
energy saving in order to compensate the coverage of Cell B.
Cell A which is compensating Cell B in outage shall not go into energySaving
state as long as its compensation for Cell B is needed.
##### 4.7.3.2.2 Prevention
Prevention is hardly possible.
##### 4.7.3.2.3 Resolution
Refer to clause 4.7.4 General SON coordination solutions.
#### 4.7.3.3 Coordination between Cell Outage Compensation and Automatic
Neighbour Relation
##### 4.7.3.3.1 Description
In case one cell is detected in outage, COC will try to compensate the outage
cell by reconfiguring the RF configuration of some compensation candidate
cells. As a result of this, there will be new NRs (neighbour relations) which
reflect the new topology relations.
For a stable network, ANR could be deactivated for the purpose of system
resource saving. If ANR is deactivated, the new NRs cannot be captured in NRT
by ANR. Network performance, for example, handover will be impacted negatively
by the NRT which lacks of the new NRs.
##### 4.7.3.3.2 Prevention
Prevention is hardly possible, except making the cells as outage proof as
possible. But cell outages can happen even to the most stable cell in a
network.
##### 4.7.3.3.3 Resolution
The ANR function should monitor if a cell outage or cell outage compensation
takes place within its area. If this happens, then the ANR function should
check the NRs of the affected cells (for example the outage cell and its
neighbours and neighbours' neighbours). In case the ANR function in the the
affected area is deactivated, the possible NRs change of the affected cells
should be taken as a factor to reactivate the ANR function.
#### 4.7.3.4 Coordination between HandOver parameter Optimization and Load
Balancing Optimization
##### 4.7.3.4.1 Description
HOO function and LBO function both optimize network performance by adjusting
handover parameters such as CIO, Hysteresis, TTT, etc. Conflicts may happen
when HOO function and LBO function are changing the same or associated
handover parameters in opposite direction or towards the same direction but on
different scales.
For example, HOO function may adjust handover parameters (e.g. _decrease_ CIO
of source cell A to target cell B) to minimize the number of too early
handovers from cell A to cell B whilst LBO function may adjust handover
parameters (e.g. _increase_ the CIO of source cell A to target cell B) to make
the handover from cell A to cell B more easier in case the load of cell B is
much less than cell A.
##### 4.7.3.4.2 Prevention
Prevention is hardly possible unless switch off HOO function or LBO function.
However, disabling the complete HOO function or LBO function cannot fulfil the
requirement that both handover performance and load performance need to be
improved at the same time.
##### 4.7.3.4.3 Resolution
For the coordination between HOO and LBO, IRPManager should assign priorities
for HOO function and LBO function or weights for targets of HOO function and
LBO function according to operator's policy.
The policy should cover different scenarios well:
\- Policy may assign higher priority for HOO function than LBO function or
higher weight for target of HOO function than targets of LBO function when
resolving MRO issues (HO too early/too late/to wrong cell) is the main
objective of network optimization, e.g. in handover optimization scenario for
better coverage.
\- Policy may assign lower priority for HOO function than LBO function or
lower weight for target of HOO function than targets of LBO function when
enhancing load performance is the main objective of network optimization, e.g.
in load optimization scenario for better capacity.
Concrete way of using priority or weights of targets, refers to clause 4.7.4
General SON coordination solutions.
### 4.7.4 General SON coordination solutions
#### 4.7.4.1 Overview
As described in TS 28.627 [5], multiple SON functions may have conflicting
demands on network resources. This situation is considered as "SON functions
in conflict" and requires conflict prevention or resolution. A SON
Coordination Function will be responsible for preventing or resolving
conflicts.
Conflict needs to be detected when there is "SON functions in conflict".
Policies can be preset by operator to SON Coordination Function to avoid
conflict on certain associated resources (network elements and/or parameters)
among SON functions.
Conflict prevention is to take some advanced methods to prevent the occurrence
of conflict. However, no matter what implementation is chosen, it is
impossible to guarantee that 100% of conflicts will be prevented, so conflict
detection and resolution are needed. Conflict detection should be taken
firstly as the pre-condition of conflict resolution.
The SON Coordination Function is a logical function, which means it can be
implemented as a separate function entity or as part of SON function.
When the SON Coordination Function is implemented as a separate function
entity, all the SON functions send the necessary information to the SON
Coordination Function, the SON Coordination Function coordinate these SON
functions as a centralized control point. This centralized coordination
approach fulfills the requirements of SON coordination in a large area scope,
for example, the coordination between NM centralized SON functions and
distributed SON functions.
In some other situations, coordination is only needed in a smaller area, for
example, the coordination between distributed SON functions inside one domain.
Then the SON Coordination Function can be implemented as part of each SON
function. The necessary coordination information can be inter-exchanged
between each SON functions to achieve coordination as well.
The SON Coordination Function may reside above or below Itf-N. Figure 4.7.4.1
shows an example of a SON Coodination Function, which is a separate function
entity, above Itf-N.
**Figure 4.7.4.1: Example of SON Coordination entity located in NM**
The SON Coordination Function may be responsible for conflict prevention,
conflict resolution, or both in parallel.
#### 4.7.4.2 Conflict prevention
To prevent conflicts between the SON functions, the SON functions may ask the
SON Coordination function for permission before changing some specific
configuration parameters. The SON Coordination Function should check the SON
coordination interdependancy policy between this requesting SON function and
other SON function(s) upon receiving the permission request from the SON
function. SON coordination interdependancy policy which is pre-configured can
help the SON Coordination Function to find which SON function(s) possibly
conflict with this requesting SON function.
As a basis for decisions, the SON Coordination Function will typically use one
or some of the following inputs received from the SON function(s)
\- Which SON functions are modifying configuration parameters (including
information about vendor, release etc.)
\- Configuration parameters intended to be changed and/or their existing and
proposed new values
\- The time duration how long the configuration parameter should not be
interfered with ("impact time")
\- The state of SON functions
\- The SON targets which are the justification for the configuration change.
\- Possible impact of a parameter change on other objects ("impact area")
\- The state of certain managed objects
\- Possible impact of the parameter change on Key Performance Indicators
\- Priority of SON functions, which can be used to determine the execution
order of requests from different SON functions in case of conflicts
\- SON coordination policies
The SON Coordination Function sends the decision back to the requesting SON
function; the decision may be confirmation or suspension or rejection of the
SON executing request, or other actions like configuration of specific
parameters with specific value.
After SON function executes action, the SON Coordination Function is then
informed about the result (successful/unsuccessful, parameters changes) of the
executed SON action.
The SON Coordination Function may prevent parameter changes by one or more SON
functions for a specified time period after the same parameter has been
changed by another SON function.
The SON Coordination Function may inform a SON Function of a managed object
state change which may impact calculation of KPIs.
Detailed description of how to use general SON coordination solutions are in
Annex B.
#### 4.7.4.3 Conflict resolution
The SON Coordination Function should detect conflicts and attempt to resolve
the conflicts.
To detect conflicts, the SON Coordination Function will typically analyse one
or some of the following types of data
\- Key Performance Indicators which indicate if SON functions are meeting
their targets or improving network performance
\- Measurements which indicate if SON functions are meeting their targets or
improving network performance
\- Unacceptable oscillations in configuration parameters
To resolve conflicts, the SON Coordination Function will typically use one or
some of following methods
\- Enabling/disabling/suspending certain SON functions
\- Stopping/suspending/modifying certain SON actions
\- Modifying certain configuration parameters

SONFuncInfo hierarchy rule:
> An NRM IOC instance X may name-contain an IOC SONFuncInfo instance T. The
> rule states that:
\- If X name-contains a SONFuncInfo instance T, then T is applicable to X.
\- If X and all its superior instances do not name-contain any SONFuncInfo
instance, then no SONFuncInfo instance is applicable to X.
\- If X does not name-contain any SONFuncInfo instance, but one or more of X's
superior instances name-contain a SONFuncInfo instance, then the SONFuncInfo
instance of the superior instance closest to X, in X's naming tree, is
applicable to X.

### 5.3.7 IOC SONCoordinationPolicies
#### 5.3.7.1 Definition
This IOC represents the SON coordination policies that are selected by
IRPManagers from the IRPAgent supported policies in the case of a separate SON
coordination function is located below Itf-N (i.e., EM centralized SON
coordination) or SON coordination function is implemented as part of each SON
function (i.e., distributed SON coordination). For EM centralized SON
coordination case, the case that the SON function is located above Itf-N and
the corresponding SON coordination function is below Itf-N is not in the scope
of this release.
This IOC is not intended to be used by IRPManager to create SON coordination
policies that are not supported by IRPAgent. The selected SON coordination
policies are used by SON coordination function to coordinate the SON functions
with potential conflicts, in case no SON coordination policies are selected by
IRPManager, the default SON coordination policies are applied to the SON
coordination function below Itf-N; the default SON coordination policies are
per agreement between IRPManager and IRPAgent, the value of the default SON
coordination policies is out of the scope of this specification.
SONCoordinationPolicies hierarchy rule:
> An NRM IOC instance X may name-contain an IOC SONCoordinationPolicies
> instance T. The rule states that:
\- If X name-contains a SONCoordinationPolicies instance T, then T is
applicable to X.
\- If X and all its superior instances do not name-contain any
SONCoordinationPolicies instance, then no SONCoordinationPolicies instance is
applicable to X.
\- If X does not name-contain any SONCoordinationPolicies instance, but one or
more of X's superior instances name-contain a SONCoordinationPolicies
instance, then the SONCoordinationPolicies instance of the superior instance
closest to X, in X's naming tree, is applicable to X.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Target Achievement Evaluation
> To evaluate the result of the optimization the target achievement needs to
> be evaluated. This can be done by calculating the Total Target Achievement
> as follows.
>
> The Total Target Achievement is the sum of the products of the individual
> target achievement (difference between target and performance) and the
> individual targetWeights:
>
> Total Target Achievement =\ Sum ~i=1..n~ [ ( minTarget ~i~ -- performance
> ~i~ ) x weight~i~ ]\ \+ Sum ~j=1..n~ [ performance ~j~ -- maxTarget ~j~ ) x
> weight ~j~ ]
>
> where minTarget is a target to be minimized and maxTarget is a target to be
> maximized.
>
> For targets with a substructure (like *Characteristic, see Â§5.5.1) the above
> formula is applied to each individual substructure target.
>
> The higher the Total Target Achievement, the better is the result of the
> optimization.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Examples of how to use general SON
coordination solutions
Examples of how to use general SON coordination solutions are as below:
# B.1 Coordination of COC and CCO using priority of SON functions
> To prevent conflicting setting as illustrated in clause 4.7.3.2.1, the
> cell(s) which may need to be coordinated between COC and CCO, i.e., the
> impact area information, should be known by the SON Coordination Function.
> By comparing the priorities of COC and CCO, SON Coordination Function will
> decide to do the high-priority action and suspend the low-priority action on
> the coordinated cell(s). The priorities of COC and CCO can be preset by
> operator to SON Coordination Function, or SON Coordination Function inquires
> the default priority of COC and CCO to each of them.
>
> The cell which needs to be coordinated between COC and CCO is:
  * The cell in which there is coverage or capacity problem and CCO > action is needed, meanwhile the cell is outage or compensating or > going to compensate for outage; or
  * The cell which is located in the CCO optimization analysis area for > other cell which has coverage or capacity problem, meanwhile the > cell is outage or compensating or going to compensating for > outage;
> After the high-priority SON function executes action, the SON Coordination
> Function is informed about the result (successful/unsuccessful, parameters
> changes) of the executed high-priority SON action. Then, SON Coordination
> Function will analyse the latest network situation to decide how to deal
> with the suspended low-priority SON action, for example, resuming or
> rejecting.
# B.2 Coordination of COC, CCO and ES using priority of SON functions
> To prevent conflicting adjustment from COC, ES and optimization from CCO in
> the common affected cell(s) (e.g., Cell 2 in the Figure 4.7.3.2), the
> cell(s) which may need to be coordinated among COC, CCO and ES, i.e., the
> impact area information, should be known by the SON Coordination Function.
> By comparing the priorities of COC, CCO and ES, SON Coordination Function
> will decide to do the highest-priority action and suspend the low-priority
> actions on the coordinated cell(s). The priorities of COC, CCO and ES can be
> preset by operator to SON Coordination Function, or SON Coordination
> Function inquires the default priority of COC, CCO and ES to each of them.
>
> The cell which needs to be coordinated among COC, CCO and ES is:
  * The cell in which there is coverage or capacity problem and CCO > action is needed, meanwhile the cell is outage or compensating or > going to compensate for outage or ES; or
  * The cell which is located in the CCO optimization analysis area for > other cell which has coverage or capacity problem, meanwhile the > cell is outage or compensating or going to compensate for outage > or ES;
> After the highest-priority SON function executes action, the SON
> Coordination Function is informed about the result (successful/unsuccessful,
> parameters changes) of the executed highest-priority SON action. Then, SON
> Coordination Function will analyse the latest network situation to decide
> how to deal with the suspended low-priority SON actions, for example,
> resuming or rejecting.
# B.3 Coordination of COC, CCO and ES based on the cell state
The following lists the examples of how SON Coordination Function (SCF) can
resolve the conflicts between COC, CCO, and ES functions based on cell state.
Although not shown, priority may be used to along with the cell state to
resolve the conflicts.
**Possible conflict #1** : COC requests a cell that is compensating an energy
saving cell to compensate an outage cell
**Resolution** : When COC requests SCF that cell A is going to compensate an
outaged cell, SCF should check whether cell A is compensating an energy saving
cell. If so, SCF should check whether cell A can compensate both the outage
cell and the energy saving cell concurrently. If not, the SCF may disallow
cell A to compensate an energy saving cell.
**Possible conflict #2** : COC requests a cell that is being changed or going
to be changed by CCO to compensate an outage cell
**Resolution** : When COC requests SCF that cell A is going to compensate an
outaged cell, SCF should check whether CCO is updating parameters to optimize
the capacity and coverage of cell A. If so, SCF may not allow cell A to
compensate an outaged cell; otherwise SCF should allow cell A to compensate an
outage cell.
**Possible conflict #3** : ES requests a candidate cell that is compensating
an outage cell to compensate an energy saving cell
**Resolution** : When ES request SCF that cell A is to compensate a cell going
to enter energy saving, SCF should check the cOCStatus.state of cell A. If
cOCStatus.state = cOCCompensating, SCF should check whether cell A can
compensate both the outage cell and the energy saving cell concurrently. If
not, the SCF may disallow cell A to compensate an energy saving cell.
**Possible conflict #4** : ES requests a cell that is being changed or going
to be changed by CCO to compensate an energy saving cell
**Resolution** : When ES requests SCF that cell A is going to compensate a
cell going to enter energy saving, SCF should check whether CCO is updating
parameters to optimize the capacity and coverage of cell A. If so, SCF may not
allow cell A to compensate an energy saving cell; otherwise SCF should allow
cell A to compensate an outage cell~~.~~
**Possible conflict #5** : CCO is going to change the configuration parameter
of a cell that is compensating an outage cell
**Resolution** : When CCO requests SCF that cell A is going to change the
configuration parameter, SCF should check the cOCStatus.state of cell A. If
cOCStatus.state = cOCCompensating, SCF should disallow cell A to change the
configuration parameter.
###### ## Annex C (informative): State diagram for Distributed and EM-
centralized Energy Saving Management
Energy Saving Management "state" attributes are available at various levels:
\- SubNetwork IOC level, via the attribute esSwitch defined in the IOC
SonControl;
\- ENBFunction IOC level, via the attribute esSwitch defined in the IOC
SonControl;
\- EUtranGenericCell IOC level, via the locally defined attribute
isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed, and via the attribute energySavingState
defined in the IOC EnergySavingProperties.
The following figure provides an overview of Energy Saving Management related
IOCs, state attribute names and possible values, for Distributed and EM-
centralized Energy Saving Management:
{width="5.513194444444444in" height="3.3583333333333334in"}
Figure C-1: IOCs and state attributes for Distributed and EM-centralized ESM
Dependencies exist between distributed ESM state attributes. The diagram below
shows which allowed combinations of attribute state values, and which state
transitions, are valid and which are not.
Figure C-2: State diagram for Distributed and EM-centralized ESM
Description:
a) The ESM-related state attribute _esSwitch_ is used by IRPManager to switch
on / off the ESM functionality, in the distributed and EM-centralized
architectures. This attribute has two possible values: On, Off. It can be set
at the sub-network level and at the eNodeB level;
b) The ESM-related state attribute _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ is used by
IRPManager to prohibit or allow configuration changes of cells individually,
within a eNodeB / sub-network, for ESM purposes by the IRPAgent. This
attribute has two possible values: Yes, No.
c) The ESM-related state attribute _energySavingState_ is used to reflect the
actual status of a cell regarding the energy saving. This attribute has two
possible values: isEnergySaving, isNotEnergySaving.
Figure C-2 describes the following state transitions:
1) Transition from (_esSwitch_ = On and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = Yes
_and energySavingState_ = isNotEnergySaving) to((_esSwitch_ = On and
_isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = Yes and _energySavingState_ =
isEnergySaving): happens when:
> ES Policies attached to the subject cell and to candidate for compensation
> cells, e.g. threshold and duration, are satisfied and allow entering Energy
> Saving state.
2) Transition from (_esSwitch_ = On and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = Yes
_and energySavingState_ = isEnergySaving) to(_esSwitch_ = On and
_isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = Yes and _energySavingState_ =
isNotEnergySaving): happens when:
> ES Policies attached to the subject cell and to candidate for compensation
> cells, e.g. threshold and duration, are satisfied and allow leaving Energy
> Saving state.
3) Transition from (_esSwitch_ = On and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ =
Yes) to (_esSwitch_ = On and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = No and
_energySavingState_ = isNotEnergySaving): happens when:
> IRP Manager sets the attribute _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ to "No".
4) Transition from (_esSwitch_ = On and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = No
and _energySavingState_ = isNotEnergySaving) to
_isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = Yes: happens when:
> IRP Manager sets the attribute _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ to "Yes".
5) Transition from (_esSwitch_ = On and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ =
Yes) to( e _sSwitch_ = Off and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = Yes and
_energySavingState_ = isNotEnergySaving): happens when:
> IRP Manager sets the attribute _esSwitch_ to "Off".
6) Transition from (_esSwitch_ = Off and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ =
Yes and _energySavingState_ = isNotEnergySaving) to (e _sSwitch_ = On and
_isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = Yes and _energySavingState_ =
isNotEnergySaving): happens when:
> IRP Manager sets the attribute _esSwitch_ to "On".
7) Transition from (_esSwitch_ = On and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = No
and _energySavingState_ = isNotEnergySaving) to (e _sSwitch_ = Off and
_isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = No and _energySavingState_ =
isNotEnergySaving): happens when:
> IRP Manager sets the attribute _esSwitch_ to "Off".
8) Transition from (_esSwitch_ = Off and _isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = No
and _energySavingState_ = isNotEnergySaving) to (e _sSwitch_ = On and
_isChangeForEnergySavingAllowed_ = No and _energySavingState_ =
isNotEnergySaving): happens when:
> IRP Manager sets the attribute _esSwitch_ to "On".
