# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
HeNS Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP, through which an IRPAgent can
communicate configuration management information to one or several IRPManagers
concerning HeNS resources. The HeNS NRM IRP comprises a set of specifications
defining Requirements, a protocol neutral Information Service and one or more
Solution Set(s).
The present document specifies the Solution Sets for the HeNS NRM IRP.
This Solution Set specification is related to 3GPP TS 28.675 V13.0.X.

# 4 Solution Set Definitions
This specification defines the following 3GPP HeNS NRM IRP Solution Set
Definitions:
\- 3GPP HeNS NRM IRP CORBA SS (Annex A)
\- 3GPP HeNS NRM IRP XML Definitions (Annex B)
###### ## Annex A (normative): CORBA Solution Set
# A.0 General
This annex contains the CORBA Solution Set for the IRP whose semantics is
specified in HeNS NRM IRP: Information Service (TS 32.782 [2]).
# A.1 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of HeNS Network Resources IRP is specified
in 3GPP TS 29.675 [2].\ This clause specifies features that are specific to
the CORBA SS.
## A.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
See clause A.1.1 of [11].
## A.1.2 Rules for NRM extensions
See clause A.1.1 of [11].
# A.2 Mapping
## A.2.1 General mappings
See clause A.1.1 of [11].
## A.2.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
This SS supports reference attributes for relations other than containment
relations between objects. Reference attributes are therefore introduced in
each MOC where needed.

# A.3 Solution Set definitions
## A.3.1 IDL definition structure
Clause A.3.2 defines the MO classes for the HeNS NRM IRP.
## A.3.2 IDL specification "HensNetworkResourcesNRMDefs.idl"
//File: HensNetworkResourcesNRMDefs.idl
#ifndef __HENSNETWORKRESOURCESNRMDEFS__ IDL_
#define __HENSNETWORKRESOURCESNRMDEFS__ IDL_
#include \"GenericNetworkResourcesNRMDefs.idl\"
#pragma prefix \"3gppsa5.org\"
/**
* This module defines constants for each MO class name and
* the attribute names for each defined MO class.
*/
module HensNetworkResourcesNRMDefs

const string CLASS = \"HeNBGWFunction\";
// Attribute Names
//
const string henbgwFunctionId = \"henbgwFunctionId\";
const string henbgwId = \"henbgwId\";
const string ipConfigInfo = \"ipConfigInfo\";
const string maxNbrHeNBRegistered = \"maxNbrHeNBRegistered\";
const string maxPacketCapability = \"maxPacketCapability\";

const string configuration = \"configuration\";
const string criterion = \"criterion\";

interface HeMSFunction : GenericNetworkResourcesNRMDefs::ManagedFunction
{
const string CLASS= \"HeMSFunction\";
// Attribute Names
//
};
};
#endif //__HENSETWORKRESOURCESNRMDEFS__ IDL_
###### ## Annex B (normative): XML Definitions
# B.0 General
This annex contains the XML Definitions for the HeNS NRM IRP as it applies to
Itf-N, in accordance with HeNS NRM IRP Information Service (TS 28.765 [2]).
The XML file formats are based on XML [5], XML Schema [7] [8] and XML
Namespace [9] standards.
# B.1 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of HeNS Network Resources IRP is specified
in 3GPP TS 28.675 [2].\ This clause specifies features that are specific to
the Schema definitions.
## B.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
The syntax of a Distinguished Name is defined in 3GPP TS 32.300 [10].
# B.2 Mapping
## B.2.1 General mapping
An IOC maps to an XML element of the same name as the IOC\'s name in the IS.
An IOC attribute maps to a sub-element of the corresponding IOC\'s XML
element, and the name of this sub-element is the same as the attribute\'s name
in the IS.
## B.2.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
The mapping is not present in the current version of this specification.
# B.3 Solution Set definitions
## B.3.1 XML definition structure
Annex B.3.3 of the present document defines the NRM-specific XML schema
hensNrm.xsd for the HeNS Network Resources IRP NRM defined in 3GPP TS 28.675
[2].
XML schema hensNrm.xsd explicitly declares NRM-specific XML element types for
the related NRM.
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [3].
## B.3.2 Graphical Representation
The graphical representation is not present in the current version of this
specification.
## B.3.3 XML schema \"hensNrm.xsd\"
