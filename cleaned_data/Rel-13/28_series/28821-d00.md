# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document is the result of the Multi-SDO JWG on Model Alignment
which 3GPP TSG SA WG5 (SA5) has developed jointly with TMF and NGMN, and which
does not fully follow the 3GPP templates and drafting rules.
Therefore 3GPP SA5 has desired to keep the present document as similar as
possible to the original in ([9]), for comparison with the corresponding TMF
version.
Thus 3GPP SA5 has done only the strictly necessary changes from the 3GPP
drafting rules perspective in order to publish the present document as a 3GPP
Technical Report. One of these type of changes is due to the fact that it is
not allowed to use \"shall\" in an informative TR. However, in order to
preserve the original intention of \"must\" and \"shall\" in the original JWG
document and distinguish it from other places where \"should\" has been used
(in case it is decided in the future to transform the TR into a TS), the use
of \"shall\" is marked in italics font as \"_shall_ \".
The JWG on Model Alignment work has chosen UML to capture behaviour of
systems/entities under management.
UML provides a rich set of concepts, notations and model elements to model
distributive systems. Usage of all UML notations and model elements is not
necessary for the purpose of JWG Model Alignment work. This paper documents
the necessary and sufficient set of UML notations and model elements,
including the ones built by the UML extension mechanism \>, for
use by JWG Model Alignment work. Collectively, this set of notations and model
elements is called the FMC (developed by the Converged Management of
Fixed/Mobile Networks project) Model Repertoire.
JWG Model Alignment specifications _shall_ employ the UML notation and model
elements of this repertoire. In the course of the JWG Model Alignment work,
JWG Model Alignment group may modify (add, delete, modify) UML notation and
model elements of this repertoire when necessary.

# 5 Information Model Elements and Notations
## 5.1 General
Note that the graphical notation in this document is only used to represent
particular model elements. Although the graphical notation is a correct
representation of the model element, it may not be a valid representation of a
UML class diagram.
The examples used in this document are for illustration purposes only and may
or may not exist in specifications.
UML properties not described in this document _shall_ not be used in
specifications based on this repertoire.
## 5.2 Basic model elements
UML has defined a number of basic model elements. This sub-clause lists the
subset selected for use in specifications based on this repertoire. The
semantics of these selected basic model elements are defined in [1].
For each basic model element listed, there are three parts. The first part
contains its description. The second part contains its graphical notation
examples and the third part contains the rule, if any, recommended for
labelling or naming it.
The graphical notation has the following characteristics:
1\. Section 7.2.7 of [2] specifies \"A class is often shown with three
compartments. The middle compartment holds a list of attributes while the
bottom compartment holds a list of operations\" and \"Additional compartments
may be supplied to show other details\". This repertoire only allows the use
of the name (top) compartment and attribute (middle) compartment. The
operation (bottom) compartment may be present but is always empty, as shown in
the figure below.
{width="0.9944444444444445in" height="0.5548611111111111in"}
2\. Classes may or may not have attributes. The graphical notation of a class
may show an empty attribute (middle) compartment even if the class has
attributes, as shown in figure below.
{width="1.007638888888889in" height="0.47638888888888886in"}
3\. The visibility symbol _shall_ not appear along with the class attribute,
as shown below.
{width="1.1409722222222223in" height="0.7701388888888889in"}
4\. The use of the decoration, i.e. the symbol in the name (top) compartment,
is optional.
### 5.2.1 Attribute
#### 5.2.1.1 Description
It is a typed element representing a property of a class. See section 10.2.5
Property of [1].
An element that is typed implies that the element can only refer to a
constrained set of values.
See section 10.1.4 Type of [1] for more information on type.
See clauses 5.3.4 and 5.4.3 for predefined data types and user-defined data
types that can apply type information to an element.
The following table captures the properties of this modelled element.
Table 1: Attribute properties
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Property name | Description | Legal values | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | documentation | Contains a textual | Any | | | description of the | | | | attribute.\ | | | | Should refer (to | | | | enable traceability) | | | | to the specific | | | | requirement. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | isOrdered | For a multi-valued | True, False | | | multiplicity; this | (default) | | | specifies if the | | | | values of this | | | | attribute instance | | | | are sequentially | | | | ordered.

#### 5.2.1.2 Example
This example shows three attributes, i.e. a, b and c, listed in the attribute
(the second) compartment of the class Xyz.
{width="1.1409722222222223in" height="0.7701388888888889in"}
Figure 1: Attribute notation
#### 5.2.1.3 Name style
An attribute name _shall_ use the LCC style.
Well Known Abbreviation (WKA) is treated as a word if used in a name. However,
WKA _shall_ be used as is (its letter case cannot be changed) except when it
is the first word of a name; and if so, its first letter _shall_ be in lower
case.
### 5.2.2 Association relationship
#### 5.2.2.1 Description
It shows a relationship between two classes and describes the reasons for the
relationship and the rules that might govern that relationship.
It has ends. Its end, the association end(s), specifies the role that the
object at one end of a relationship performs. Each end of a relationship has
properties that specify the role (see clause 5.2.9), multiplicity (see clause
5.2.8), visibility and navigability (see the arrow symbol used in figure 3)
and may have constraints. Note that visibility _shall_ not be used in models
based on this Repertoire (see bullet 3 of 5.1).
See section 7.3.3 Association of [2].
Three examples below show a binary association between two model elements. The
association can include the possibility of relating a model element to itself.
The first example (figure 2) shows a bi-directional navigable association in
that each model element has a pointer to the other. The second example (figure
3) shows a unidirectional association (shown with an open arrow at the target
model element end) in that only the source model element has a pointer to the
target model element and not vice-versa. The third example (figure 4) shows a
bi-directional non-navigable association in that each model element does not
have a pointer to the other; i.e. such associations are just for illustration
purposes.
#### 5.2.2.2 Example
An association _shall_ have an indication of cardinality (see clause 5.2.8).
It _shall_ , except the case of non-navigable association, have an indication
of the role name (see clause 5.2.9). The model element involved in an
association is said to be \"playing a role\" in that association. The role has
a name such as +aClass in the first example below. Note that the \"+\"
character in front of the role name, indicating the visibility, is ignored.
{width="4.402777777777778in" height="0.46805555555555556in"}
Figure 2: Bidirectional association relationship notation
{width="4.436111111111111in" height="0.3541666666666667in"}
Figure 3: Unidirectional association relationship notation
{width="4.313194444444444in" height="0.40555555555555556in"}
Figure 4: Non-navigable association relationship notation
Note that some tools do not use arrows in the UML graphical representation for
bidirectional associations. Therefore, absence of arrows is not, but absence
of role names is, an indication of a non-navigable association.
#### 5.2.2.3 Name style
An Association can have a name. Use of Association name is optional. Its name
style is LCC style.
A role name _shall_ use the LCC style.
### 5.2.3 Aggregation association relationship
#### 5.2.3.1 Description
It shows a class as a part of or subordinate to another class.
An aggregation is a special type of association in which objects are assembled
or configured together to create a more complex object. Aggregation protects
the integrity of an assembly of objects by defining a single point of control
called aggregate, in the object that represents the assembly.
See section .3.2 AggregationKind (from Kernel) of [2].
#### 5.2.3.2 Example
A hollow diamond attached to the end of a relationship is used to indicate an
aggregation. The diamond is attached to the class that is the aggregate. The
aggregation association _shall_ have an indication of cardinality at each end
of the relationship (see clause 5.2.8).
{width="4.017361111111111in" height="0.3638888888888889in"}
Figure 5: Aggregation association relationship notation
#### 5.2.3.3 Name style
An Association can have a name. Use of Association name is optional. Its name
style is LCC.
### 5.2.4 Composite aggregation association relationship
#### 5.2.4.1 Description
A composite aggregation association is a strong form of aggregation that
requires a part instance be included in at most one composite at a time. If a
composite is deleted, all of its parts are deleted as well.
A composite aggregation _shall_ contain a description of its use.
See section 7.3.3 Association (from Kernel) of [2].
#### 5.2.4.2 Example
A filled diamond attached to the end of a relationship is used to indicate a
composite aggregation. The diamond is attached to the class that is the
composite. The composition association _shall_ have an indication of
cardinality at each end of the relationship (see clause 5.2.8).
{width="4.715277777777778in" height="0.4791666666666667in"}
Figure 6: Composite aggregation association relationship notation
#### 5.2.4.3 Name style
An Association can have a name. Use of Association name is optional. Its name
style is LCC.
### 5.2.5 Generalization relationship
#### 5.2.5.1 Description
It indicates a relationship in which one class (the child) inherits from
another class (the parent).
See clause 7.3.20 Generalization of [2].
#### 5.2.5.2 Example
This example shows a generalization relationship between a more general model
element (the **IRPAgent**) and a more specific model element (the
IRPAgentVendorA) that is fully consistent with the first element and that adds
additional information.
{width="4.975694444444445in" height="0.44513888888888886in"}
Figure 7: Generalization relationship notation
#### 5.2.5.3 Name style
It has no name so there is no name style.
### 5.2.6 Dependency relationship
#### 5.2.6.1 Description
\"A dependency is a relationship that signifies that a single or a set of
model elements requires other model elements for their specification or
implementation. This means that the complete semantics of the depending
elements is either semantically or structurally dependent on the definition of
the supplier element(s)...\", an extract from section 7.3.12 Dependency of
[2].
#### 5.2.6.2 Example
This example shows that the BClass instances have a semantic relationship with
the AClass instances. It indicates a situation in which a change to the target
element (the AClass in the example) will require a change to the source
element (the BClass in the example) in the dependency.
{width="3.7194444444444446in" height="0.48819444444444443in"}
Figure 8: Dependency relationship notation
#### 5.2.6.3 Name style
An Association can have a name. Use of Association name is optional. Its name
style is LCC.
### 5.2.7 Comment
#### 5.2.7.1 Description
A comment is a textual annotation that can be attached to a set of elements.
See section 7.3.9 Comment (from Kernel) from [2].
#### 5.2.7.2 Example
This example shows a comment, as a rectangle with a \"bent corner\" in the
upper right corner. It contains text. It appears on a particular diagram and
may be attached to zero or more modelling elements by dashed lines.
{width="4.423611111111111in" height="1.0298611111111111in"}
Figure 9: Comment notation
#### 5.2.7.3 Name style
It has no name so there is no name style.
### 5.2.8 Multiplicity, a.k.a. cardinality in relationships
#### 5.2.8.1 Description
\"A multiplicity is a definition of an inclusive interval of non-negative
integers beginning with a lower bound and ending with a (possibly infinite)
upper bound. A multiplicity element embeds this information to specify the
allowable cardinalities for an instantiation of this element...\", an extract
from section 7.3.32 MultiplicityElement of [2].
Table 2: Multiplicity-string definitions
* * *
Multiplicity Explanation 1 Attribute has one attribute value. _m_ Attribute
has _m_ attribute values. 0..1 Attribute has zero or one attribute value. 0..*
Attribute has zero or more attribute values. * Attribute has zero or more
attribute values. 1..* Attribute has at least one attribute value. _m..n_
Attribute has at least _m_ but no more than _n_ attribute values.
* * *
The use of \"0..n\" is not recommended although it has the same meaning as
\"0..*\" and \"*\".
The use of a standalone symbol zero (0) is not allowed.
#### 5.2.8.2 Example
This example shows a multiplicity attached to the end of an association path.
The meaning of this multiplicity is one to many. One Network instance is
associated with zero, one or more SubNetwork instances. Other valid examples
can show the \"many to many\" relationship.
{width="5.1402777777777775in" height="0.4479166666666667in"}
Figure 10: Cardinality notation
The cardinality zero is not used to indicate the IOC\'s so-called \"transient
state\" characteristic. For example, it is not used to indicate that the
instance is not yet created but it is in the process of being created. The
cardinality zero will not be used to indicate this characteristic since such
characteristic is considered inherent in all IOCs. All IOCs defined are
considered to have such inherent \"transient state\" characteristics.
Note that the use of \"0..*\", \"0..n\" or \'*\' means \"zero to many\". The
use of \"0..*\" is recommended. The following table shows some valid examples
of multiplicity.
Table 3: Multiplicity-string examples
* * *
Multiplicity Explanation 1 Attribute has exactly one attribute value. 5
Attribute has exactly 5 attribute values. 0..1 Attribute has zero or one
attribute value. 0..* Attribute has zero or more attribute values. 1..*
Attribute has at least one attribute value. 4..12 Attribute has at least 4 but
no more than 12 attribute values.
* * *
#### 5.2.8.3 Name style
It has no name so there is no name style.
### 5.2.9 Role
#### 5.2.9.1 Description
It indicates navigation, from one class to another class, involved in an
association relationship. A role is named. The direction of navigation is to
the class attached to the end of the association relationship with (or near)
the role name.
The use of role name in the graphical representation is mandatory for
bidirectional and unidirectional association relationship notations (see
figures 2 and 3). Role name _shall_ not be used in non-navigable association
relationship notation (see figure 4).
A role at the navigable end of a relationship becomes (or is mapped into) an
attribute (called role-attribute) in the source class of the relationship.
Therefore roles have the same behaviour (or properties) as attributes. See
table 1.
The role-attribute _shall_ have all properties defined for attributes in
clause 5.2.1 and in addition the following property:
Table 3A: passedById property
+---------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+ | Property name | Description | Legal values | +---------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+ | passedById | If True, the | True (default), False | | | role-attribute | | | | (navigable association | | | | source end) contains a | | | | DN of the navigable | | | | association target end | | | | instance. | | | | | | | | If False, the | | | | role-attribute contains | | | | (a copy of) the whole | | | | target end instance | | | | (e.g. X). If X has a | | | | role-attribute whose | | | | \"passedById==False\", | | | | then the subject | | | | role-attribute contains | | | | (a copy of) X\'s target | | | | end instance as well. | | | | | | | | The above rule is | | | | applied repeatedly for | | | | all occurrences of | | | | \"passedById==False\". | | | | This application can | | | | result in a collection | | | | of instances where no | | | | ordering can be implied | | | | and no instances are | | | | duplicated. | | | | | | | | Use of | | | | \"passedById==False\" | | | | supports the efficient | | | | access of target end | | | | instances from a source | | | | end instance. The | | | | mechanism by which such | | | | access is achieved is | | | | operation model design | | | | specific (e.g. not | | | | related to resource | | | | model design). | | +---------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+
#### 5.2.9.2 Example
This example shows that a Person (say instance John) is associated with a
Company (say whose DN is \"Company=XYZ\"). We navigate the association by
using the opposite association-end such that John\'s Person.theCompany would
hold the DN, i.e. \"Company=XYZ\".
{width="4.972222222222222in" height="0.5208333333333334in"}
Figure 11: Role notation
#### 5.2.9.3 Name style
A role has a name. Use noun for the name. The name style follows the attribute
name style; see clause 5.2.1.3.
### 5.2.10 Xor constraint
#### 5.2.10.1 Description
\"A Constraint represents additional semantic information attached to the
constrained elements. A constraint is an assertion that indicates a
restriction that _shall_ be satisfied by a correct design of the system. The
constrained elements are those elements required to evaluate the constraint
specification...\", an extract from section 7.3.10 Constraint (from Kernel) of
[2].
For a constraint that applies to two elements such as two associations, the
constraint _shall_ be shown as a dashed line between the elements labeled by
the constraint string (in braces). The constraint string, in this case, is
xor.
#### 5.2.10.2 Example
The figure below shows a ServerObjectClass instance that has relation(s) to
multiple instances of a class from the choice of
ClientObjectCLass_Alternative1, ClientObjectClass_Alternative2 or
ClinetObjectCLass_Alternative3.
{width="4.375in" height="1.59375in"}
Figure 12: {xor} notation
#### 5.2.10.3 Name style
It has no name so there is no name style.
## 5.3 Stereotype
Clause 5.1 listed the UML defined basic model elements. UML defined a
stereotype concept allowing the specification of simple or complex user-
defined model elements.
This clause lists all allowable stereotypes for this repertoire.
For each stereotype model element listed, there are three parts. The first
part contains its description. The second part contains its graphical notation
examples and the third part contains the rule, if any, recommended for
labelling or naming it.
### 5.3.1 \>
#### 5.3.1.1 Description
It is a form or template representing a number of
\>. It encapsulates attributes, links, methods (or
operations), and interactions that are present in the represented
\>.
The semantics of a \> is that all behaviour of the
\> is present in the represented \>.
Since this class is simply a representation of other classes, this class
cannot define its own behaviour other than those already defined by the
represented \>.
A particular \> can be represented by zero, one or
more \>. For example, the ManagedElement
\> can have MonitoredEntity \> and
ManagedEntity \>.
The attributes of the \> are accessible by the source entity
that has an association with the \>.
#### 5.3.1.2 Example
This shows a \> named MonitoredEntity. It represents (or its
constraints is that it represents) all NRM \> (e.g.
GgsnFunction \>) whose instances are being monitored
for alarm conditions. It is mandatory to use a Note to capture the constraint.
{width="4.144444444444445in" height="0.5395833333333333in"}
Figure 13: \> notation
See annex A for more examples that use \>.
#### 5.3.1.3 Name style
For \> name, use the same style as \>
(see clause 5.3.2).
### 5.3.2 \>
#### 5.3.2.1 Description
The \> is identical to UML _class_ except that it
does not include/define methods or operations.
A UML _class_ represents a capability or concept within the system being
modelled. Classes have data structure and behaviour and relationships to other
elements.
This class can inherit from zero, one or multiple classes (multiple
inheritances).

#### 5.3.2.3 Name style
The name _shall_ use UCC style. The name _shall_ end with an underscore if it
is an abstract class in the UIM. The name _shall_ not end with an underscore
if it is a concrete class.
WKA is treated as a word if used in a name. However, WKA _shall_ be used as is
(its letter case cannot be changed) except when it is the first word of the
name; and if so, its first letter _shall_ be in upper case.
Embedded underscore is not allowed except the name is for an Association class
(see clause 5.4.1).
### 5.3.3 \>
#### 5.3.3.1 Description
The \> is modelled by a composition association where both ends are
non-navigable. The source class is the composition and the target class is the
component. The target instance is uniquely identifiable, within the namespace
of the source entity, among all other targeted instances of the same target
class and among other targeted instances of other classes that have the same
\> composition with the source.
The source class and target class _shall_ each has its own naming attribute.
The composition aggregation association relationship is used as the act of
name containment providing a semantic of a whole-part relationship between the
domain and the named elements that are contained, even if only by name. From
the management perspective access to the part is through the whole.
Multiplicity _shall_ be indicated at both ends of the relationship.
A target instance can not have multiple \> with multiple sources,
i.e. a target instance can not participate in or belong to multiple
namespaces.
#### 5.3.3.2 Example
This shows that all instances of Class4 are uniquely identifiable within a
Class3 instance\'s namespace.

#### 5.3.3.3 Name style
It has no name so there is no name style.
### 5.3.4 \>
#### 5.3.4.1 Description
It represents the general notion of being a data type (i.e. a type whose
instances are identified only by their values) whose definition is defined by
user (e.g. specification authors).
This repertoire uses two kinds of data types: predefined data types and user-
defined data types. The former is defined in clause 5.4.3. The latter is
defined by the specifications authors using this \> model element.
The user-defined data types support the modelling of structured data types
(see \> notations in clause 5.3.4.2). When user-defined or
predefined data type is used to apply type information to a class attribute
(see clause 5.2.1), the data type name is shown along with the class
attribute. See user example of \> in clause 5.3.4.2.
#### 5.3.4.2 Example
The following examples are two user-defined data types. The left-most is named
PlmnId that consists of Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code
(MNC), whose types are the predefined data types in clause 5.4.3. The right-
most is named Xyz that consists of two predefined data types (i.e. String,
Integer and one user-defined data type PlmnId.
{width="2.2041666666666666in" height="0.8729166666666667in"}

#### 5.3.4.3 Name style
For \> name, use the same style as \>
(see clause 5.3.2).
For \> attribute, use the same style as Attribute (see clause
5.2.1).
### 5.3.5 \>
#### 5.3.5.1 Description
An enumeration is a data type. It contains sets of named literals that
represent the values of the enumeration. An enumeration has a name.
See section 10.3.2 Enumeration of [1].
#### 5.3.5.2 Example
This example shows an enumeration model element whose name is Account and it
has four enumeration literals. The upper compartment contains the keyword
\> and the name of the enumeration. The lower compartment
contains a list of enumeration literals.
Note that the symbol to the right of \> Account in the figure
below is a feature specific to a particular modelling tool. It is recommended
that modelling tool features should be used when appropriate.

#### 5.3.5.3 Name style
For \> name, use the same style as \>
(see clause 5.3.2).
For \> attribute (the enumeration literal), use the following
rules:
  * Enumeration literal is composed of one or more words of upper case > characters. Words are separated by the underscore character.
### 5.3.6 \>
#### 5.3.6.1 Description
The Â«choiceÂ» stereotype represents one of a set of classes (when used as an
information model element) or one of a set of data types (when used as an
operations model element).
This stereotype property, e.g. one out of a set of possible alternatives, is
identical to the {xor} constraint (see clause 5.2.10).
#### 5.3.6.2 Example
Sometimes the specific kind of class cannot be determined at model
specification time. In order to support such scenario, the specification is
done by listing all possible classes.
The following diagram lists 3 possible classes. It also shows a Â«choice,
InformationObjectClassÂ» named SubstituteObjectClass. This scenario indicates
that only one of the three Â«InformationObjectClassÂ» named
Alternative1ObjectClass, Alternative2ObjectClass, Alternative3ObjectClass
_shall_ be realised.
The Â«choiceÂ» stereotype represents one of a set of classes when used as an
information model element.
{width="3.4375in" height="1.7152777777777777in"}
Figure 19: Information model element example using Â«choiceÂ» notation
Sometimes the specific kind of data type cannot be determined at model
specification time. In order to support such scenario, the specification is
done by listing all possible data types.
The following diagram lists 2 possible data types. It also shows a Â«choiceÂ»
named ProbableCause. This scenario indicates that only one of the two
Â«dataTypeÂ» named IntegerProbableCause, StringProbableCause _shall_ be
realised.
The Â«choiceÂ» stereotype represents one of a set of data types when used as an
operations model element.

Sometimes models distinguish between sink/source/bidirectional termination
points. A generic class which comprises these three specific classes can be
modelled using the Â«choiceÂ» stereotype.

notation
#### 5.3.6.3 Name style
For \> name, use the same style as \> (see
clause 5.3.2).
## 5.4 Others
### 5.4.1 Association class
#### 5.4.1.1 Description
An association class is an association that also has class properties (or a
class that has association properties).\ Even though it is drawn as an
association and a class, it is really just a single model element.
See section 7.3.4 AssociationClass of [2].
Association classes are appropriate for use when an Â«InformationObjectClassÂ»
needs to maintain associations to several other instances of
Â«InformationObjectClassÂ» and there are relationships between the members of
the associations within the scope of the \"containing\"
Â«InformationObjectClassÂ». For example, a namespace maintains a set of
bindings, a binding ties a name to an identifier. A NameBinding
Â«InformationObjectClassÂ» can be modelled as an Association Class that provides
the binding semantics to the relationship between an identifier and some other
Â«InformationObjectClassÂ» such as Object in the figure. This is depicted in the
following figure.
#### 5.4.1.2 Example

#### 5.4.1.3 Name style
The name _shall_ use the same style as in \> (see
clause 5.3.2.3).
### 5.4.2 Abstract class
#### 5.4.2.1 Description
It specifies a special kind of \> as the general
model element involved in a generalization relationship (see clause 5.2.5). An
abstract class cannot be instantiated.
This modelled element has the same properties as class. See clause 5.3.2.
#### 5.4.2.2 Example
This shows that _Class5__ is an abstract class. It is the base class for
SpecialisedClass5.
{width="4.073611111111111in" height="0.34375in"}
Figure 23: Abstract class notation
#### 5.4.2.3 Name style
For abstract class name, use the same style as \>
(see clause 5.3.2). The name _shall_ be in italics.
In the UIM and UOM its last character _shall_ be an underscore.
### 5.4.3 Predefined data types
#### 5.4.3.1 Description
It represents the general notion of being a data type (i.e. a type whose
instances are identified only by their values) whose definition is defined by
this specification and not by the user (e.g. specification authors).
This repertoire uses two kinds of data types: predefined data types and user-
defined data types. The latter are defined in clauses 5.3.4 and 5.3.5.
Table 5 lists the UML data types selected for use as predefined data type.

# 6 Operations Model Elements and Notations
## 6.1 General
Note that the graphical notation in this document is only used to represent
particular model elements. Although the graphical notation is a correct
representation of the model element, it may not be a valid representation of a
UML class diagram.
The examples used in this document are for illustration purposes only and may
or may not exist in specifications.
UML properties not described in this document _shall_ not be used in
specifications based on this repertoire.
## 6.2 Basic model elements
UML has defined a number of basic model elements. This sub-clause lists the
subset selected for use in specifications based on this repertoire. The
semantics of these selected basic model elements are defined in [1].
For each basic model element listed, there are three parts. The first part
contains its description. The second part contains its graphical notation
examples and the third part contains the rule, if any, recommended for
labelling or naming it.
The graphical notation has the following characteristics:
1\. Section 7.2.7 of [2] specifies \"A class is often shown with three
compartments. The middle compartment holds a list of attributes while the
bottom compartment holds a list of operations\". This repertoire only allows
the use of the name (top) compartment and operations (third) compartment. The
attribute (middle) compartment may be present as shown in the figure below.
{width="1.2291666666666667in" height="0.7909722222222222in"}
2\. Interfaces are identified by the stereotype Â«interfaceÂ».
3\. The use of the decoration, i.e. the symbol in the name (top) compartment
({width="0.19791666666666666in" height="0.23958333333333334in"}), is optional.
4\. Each Interface _shall_ have at least one operation.
5\. Section 13.3.24 Signal [2] \"A signal is a specification of send request
instances communicated between objects. The receiving object handles the
received request instances as specified by its receptions. The data carried by
a send request (which was passed to it by the send invocation occurrence that
caused that request) are represented as attributes of the signal. A signal is
defined independently of the classifiers handling the signal occurrence.\"
A signal triggers a reaction in the receiver in an asynchronous way and
without a reply. The sender of a signal will not block waiting for a reply but
continue execution immediately. A signal is depicted by a classifier symbol
with the keyword Â«signalÂ».
{width="1.0409722222222222in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}
A class can be shown with four compartments. The fourth compartment holds a
list of signals (send requests).
{width="1.2291666666666667in" height="0.8958333333333334in"}
### 6.2.1 Interface
#### 6.2.1.1 Description
_\"An interface is a kind of classifier that represents a declaration of a set
of coherent public features and obligations. An interface specifies a
contract; any instance of a classifier that realizes the interface shall
fulfil that contract. The obligations that may be associated with an interface
are in the form of various kinds of constraints (such as pre- and post-
conditions) or protocol specifications, which may impose ordering restrictions
on interactions through the interface._
_Since interfaces are declarations, they are not instantiable. Instead, an
interface specification is implemented by an instance of an instantiable
classifier, which means that the instantiable classifier presents a public
facade that conforms to the interface specification. Note that a given
classifier may implement more than one interface and that an interface may be
implemented by a number of different classifiers (see \"InterfaceRealization
(from Interfaces)\" on page 89).\"_ \- see section 7.3.24 \"Interface\" of
[2].
Table 7 captures the properties of an interface.

Figure 25: Â«InterfaceÂ» notation
#### 6.2.1.3 Name style
The name _shall_ use UCC style.
### 6.2.2 Operation
#### 6.2.2.1 Description
\"_An operation is a behavioural feature of a classifier that specifies the
name, type, parameters, and constraints for invoking an associated behaviour._
\" - see section 7.3.37 \"Operation\" of [2].
Operations are grouped in interface classes.
These operation properties apply for synchronous and asynchronous mode of
operations.
Operations return either an exception or return output parameters including a
status. The \"status\" output parameter is used to inform about the outcome of
an operation that does not have an exception.
Table 8 captures the properties of an operation.

#### 6.2.2.3 Name style
An operation name _shall_ use the LCC style.
#### 6.2.2.4 Exceptions
This Repertoire defines a list of pre-defined exceptions. To increase
interoperability, the specifications authors _shall_ use these exceptions
whenever possible. Additional exceptions are only allowed if none of these
pre-defined exceptions fit. Any additional exceptions are preferably formed by
inheritance of pre-defined exception(s).
These pre-defined exceptions may be appended by a string which describes the
failure reason.
Table 9 lists the pre-defined exceptions that _shall_ be supported by an
operation.

Exception Description AccessDenied This exception _shall_ be raised if the
client is not permitted to perform the operation. CapacityExceeded This
exception _shall_ be raised if the request will result in resources (e.g.
Termination Points or Measurement Jobs) being created or activated beyond the
capacity supported by the NE or server. FilterNotSupported This exception
_shall_ be raised if a filter definition is not supported by the server. The
failure reason _shall_ indicate the more precise reason. NotInValidState This
exception _shall_ be raised if the state of the identified object is such that
the server cannot perform the operation. ObjectExisting This exception _shall_
be raised if an object instance cannot be created because an object with the
same identity/name already exists. ObjectInUse This exception _shall_ be
raised if the object identified in the request is currently in use.
ObjectNotExisting This exception _shall_ be raised if the object identified in
the request does not exist. UnableToNotify This exception _shall_ be raised if
the server is unable to connect to the Notification Service.

# 7 Qualifiers
This clause defines the qualifiers applicable for model elements specified in
this document, e.g. the IOC (see clause 5.3.2), the Attribute (see clause
5.2.1). The qualifications are M, O, CM, CO, C and \'SS\'. Their meanings are
specified in this section. This type of qualifier is called Support Qualifier
(see supportQualifier of IOC in Table 3 and supportQualifier of attribute in
table 1 of clause 5.2.1).
This clause also defines the qualifiers applicable to various properties of a
model element, e.g. see the IOC properties excepting \'supportQualifier\' in
Table 3 and attributes properties excepting supportQualifier in table 1 of
clause 5.2.1. The qualifications are M, O, CM, CO, C and \'-\'. Their meanings
are specified in this section. This type of qualifier is simply called
Qualifier.
Definition of M (Mandatory) qualification:
  * The capability (e.g. the Attribute named abc of an IOC named Xyz; > the write property of Attribute named abc of an IOC named Xyz; the > IOC named Xyz) _shall_ be supported.
Definition of O (Optional) qualification:
  * The capability may or may not be supported.
Definition of CM (Conditional-Mandatory) qualification:
  * The capability _shall_ be supported under certain conditions, > specifically:
\- When qualified as CM, the capability _shall_ have a corresponding
constraint defined in the specification. If the specified constraint is met
then the capability _shall_ be supported.
Definition of CO (Conditional-Optional) qualification:
  * The capability may be supported under certain conditions, > specifically:
\- When qualified as CO, the capability _shall_ have a corresponding
constraint defined in the specification. If the specified constraint is met
then the capability may be supported.
Definition of C (Conditional) qualification:
  * Used for items that has multiple constraints. Each constraint is > worded as a condition for one kind of support such as mandatory > support, optional support or \"no support\". All constraints > _shall_ be related to the same kind of support. Specifically:
\- Each item with C qualification _shall_ have the corresponding multiple
constraints defined in the specification. If all specified constraints are met
and are related to mandatory, then the item _shall_ be supported. If all the
specified constraints are met and are related to optional, then the item may
be supported. If all the specified constraints are met and are related to \"no
support\", then the item _shall_ not be supported.
NOTE: This qualifier should only be used when absolutely necessary, as it is
more complex to implement.
Definition of SS (SS Conditional) qualification:
  * The capability _shall_ be supported by at least one but not all > solutions.
Definition of \'-\' (no support) qualification:
  * The capability _shall_ not be supported.
# 8 UML Diagram Requirements
Classes and their relationships _shall_ be presented in class diagrams.
It is recommended to create:
  * An overview class diagram containing all classes related to a > specific management area (Class Diagram).
\- The class name compartment should contain the location of the class
definition (e.g. \"Qualified Name\").
\- The class attributes should show the \"Signature\". (see section 7.3.45 of
[2] for the signature definition).
  * A separate inheritance class diagram in case the overview diagram > would be overloaded when showing the inheritance structure > (Inheritance Class Diagram).
  * A class diagram containing the user defined data types (Type > Definitions Diagram).
  * Additional class diagrams to show specific parts of the > specification in detail.
  * State diagrams for complex state attributes.

###### ### Annex C: Design patterns
# C.0 \"Normative or Informative\" status of this annex
The JWG specified annex C in [9] as \"Normative\". If SA5 in the future
decides to transform the present document into a TS, then this \"Normative\"
status should be preserved.
# C.1 Intervening Class and Association Class
## C.1.1 Concept and Definition
Classes may be related via simple direct associations or via associations with
related association classes.
However, in situations where the relationships between a number of classes is
complex and especially where the relationships between instances of those
classes are themselves interrelated there may be a need to encapsulate the
complexity of the relationships within a class that sits between the classes
that are to be related. The term \"intervening class\" is used here to name
the pattern that describes this approach. The name \"intervening class\" is
used as the additional class \"intervenes\" in the relationships between other
classes.
The \"intervening class\" differs from the association class as the
intervening class does break the association between the classes where as the
association class does not but instead sits to one side. This can be seen in
the following figure. A direct association between class A and C appears the
same at A and C regardless of the presence or absence of an association class
where as in the case of the \"intervening class\" there are associations
between A and the \"intervening class\" B and C and the \"intervening class\"
B.
Figure C.1: Various association forms
The \"intervening class\" is essentially no different to any other class in
that it may encapsulate attributes, complex behaviour, etc.
Figure C.2 shows an instance view of both an association class form and an
\"intervening class\" form for a complex interrelationship.
{width="6.021527777777778in" height="4.261111111111111in"}
Figure C.2: Instance view of \"intervening class\"
The case depicted above does not show interrelationships between the
relationships. A practical case from modeling of the relationships between
Termination Points in a fixed network does show this relationship
interrelationship challenge. In this case the complexity of relationship is
between instances of the same class, the Termination Point (TP). The
complexity is encapsulated in a SubNetworkConnection (SNC) class.
Figure C.3: SNC intervening in TP-TP relationship
The SNC also encapsulates the complex behaviour of switching and path
selection as depicted below.
{width="5.325in" height="2.6979166666666665in"}
Figure C.4: Complex relationship interrelationships
## C.1.2 Usage in the non-transport domain
The choice of association class pattern or intervening class pattern is on a
case-by-case basis.
The transport domain boundary is highlighted in figure C.5.
Figure C.5: Highlighting the boundary between transport and non-transport
domains
## C.1.3 Usage in the transport domain
The following guidelines _shall_ be applied to the models of the \"transport
domain\".
When considering interrelationships between classes the following guidelines
should be applied:
  * If considering all current and recognised potential future cases it > is expected that the relationship between two specific classes > will be 0..1:0..1 then a simple association should be used.
\- This may benefit from an association class to convey rules and parameters
about the association behaviour in complex cases.
  * If there is recognised potential for cases currently or in future > where there is a 0..*:0..* between two specific classes then > intervening classes should be used to encapsulate the groupings > etc. so as to convert it to 0..1:n..*.
\- Note that the 0..1:n..* association may benefit from an association class
to convey rules and parameters about the association behaviour in complex
cases but in the instance form this can probably be ignored or folded into the
intervening class.
  * In general it seems appropriate to use an association class when the > properties on the relationship instance cannot be obviously or > reasonably folded into one of the classes at either end of the > association and when there is no interdependency between > association instances between a set of instances of the classes.
An example of usage of intervening class is the case of the TP-TP
(TerminationPoint) relationship (0..*:0..*) where the SNC
(SubNetworkConnection) is added as the intervening class between multiple TPs,
i.e. TP-SNC. Note that TP-SNC actually becomes 0..2:n..* due to directionality
encapsulation.
Considering the case of the adjacency relationship between PTPs it is known
that although the current common cases are 1:1 there are some current and many
potential future case of 0..*:0..* and hence a model that has an intervening
class, i.e. the TopologicalLink, should be used.
For a degenerate instance cases of 0..*:0..* that happens to be 0..1:0..1 the
intervening class pattern should still be used:
  * Using the 0..1:0..1 direct association in this degenerate case > brings unnecessary variety to the model and hence to the behaviour > of the application (the 0..1:n..* model covers the 0..1:0..1 case > with one single code form clearly).
  * An instance of the 0..1:0..1 model may need to be migrated to > 0..1:n..* as a result of some change in the network forcing an > unnecessary administrative action to transition the model form > where as in the 0..1:n..* form requires no essential change.

###### ### Annex D: Stereotypes for naming purposes
# D.0 \"Normative or Informative\" status of this annex
The JWG specified annex D in [9] as \"Informative\". If SA5 in the future
decides to transform the present document into a TS, then this \"Informative\"
status should be preserved.
# D.1 Stereotypes for naming purposes
The following diagram illustrates the various stereotypes for naming purposes.
The \> with solid-diamond (see 5.3.3) identifies:
  * The naming class (close to the solid diamond) and a named class;
  * The naming scheme is DN;
  * The container (close to the solid diamond) and the content.
The \> with other types of associations (and excluding those labelled
\"Not Allowed\") identifies:
  * The naming class (close to the hollow diamond or the source with > regard to arrow direction) and a named class (the target);
  * The naming scheme is DN.
The \> with dependency (dotted arrowed line) identifies:
  * The naming class (target with regard to arrow direction) and a named > class (the source);
  * The naming scheme is DN.
Referring to the figure, RMA Phase 1 allows the form Class7\>Class8.
The forms \"in red\" are not allowed.
The rest of the forms are \"under investigation in Phase 2\" since they all
require an agreed standard mechanism on handling (named) instances whose
related naming instance have been destroyed. They also lack use case support,
thus far.

decides to transform the present document into a TS, then this \"Informative\"
status should be preserved.
# E.1 Operations Model Elements under discussion
This annex lists model element definitions subject to further discussions and
agreement.
**Item #1**
##### Description {#description-22 .H6}
\"_An operation is a behavioural feature of a classifier that specifies the
name, type, parameters, and constraints for invoking an associated behaviour._
\" - see section 7.3.37 \"Operation\" of [2].
Operations are grouped in interface classes.
Table E.1 captures the properties of an operation.
Table E.1: Operation properties
* * *
Property name Description Legal values isIdempotent This property defines if
the operation is idempotent or not; i.e. the operation can be repeated
providing the same result every time (assuming that the state of the
underlying network does not change). True, False (default)
* * *
**Item #2**
##### Exceptions {#exceptions-1 .H6}
This Repertoire defines a list of pre-defined exceptions. To increase
interoperability, the specifications authors _shall_ use these exceptions
whenever possible. Additional exceptions are only allowed if none of these
pre-defined exceptions fit. Any additional exceptions are preferably formed by
inheritance of pre-defined exception(s).The following table lists the pre-
defined exceptions.
Table E.2: Pre-defined Exceptions
* * *
Exception Description AlreadyInPostCondition This exception can be used by
operations which are not defined as idempotent. It is used to indicate that
the server is already in the post-condition InventoryOutOfSync This exception
_shall_ be raised when the operation fails because the inventory data bases
from the target and client are out of sync
* * *
**Item #3**
##### Parameter {#parameter-1 .H6}
##### Description {#description-23 .H6}
\"_A parameter is a specification of an argument used to pass information into
or out of an invocation of a behavioural feature._ \" - see section 7.3.42
\"Parameter\" of [2].
