# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the configuration management documents and
protocols needed to support Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) online
configuration over the CSC-4 and CSC-5 reference points and the procedures to
support Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) offline configuration over the
CSC-11and CSC-12 reference points. Configuration management documents defined
in the present document includes:
MCPTT UE initial configuration document;
MCPTT UE configuration document;
MCPTT user profile configuration document; and
MCPTT service configuration document.
Mission critical communication services are services that require preferential
handling compared to normal telecommunication services, e.g. in support of
police or fire brigade.
The MCPTT service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications (e.g., utility companies and railways).
The present document is applicable to an MCPTT UE supporting the configuration
management client functionality, to application server supporting the
configuration management server functionality, and to application server
supporting the MCPTT server functionality.
