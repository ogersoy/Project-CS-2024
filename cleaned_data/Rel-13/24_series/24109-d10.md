# 1 Scope
The present document defines stage 3 for the HTTP Digest AKA [6] based
implementation of Ub interface (UE-BSF), the Disposable-Ks model based
implementation of Upa interface (NAF-UE) and the HTTP Digest [9] and the PSK
TLS based implementation of bootstrapped security association usage over Ua
interface (UE-NAF) in Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA) as specified
in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1]. The purpose of the Ub interface is to create a security
association between UE and BSF for further usage in GAA applications. The
purpose of the Upa interface is to provide a push mechanism to created a
bootstrapped security association between the UE and NAF for secure
communication of pushed messages. The purpose of the Ua interface is to use
the so created bootstrapped security association between UE and NAF for secure
communication.
The present document also defines stage 3 for the Authentication Proxy usage
as specified in 3GPP TS 33.222 [5].
The present document also defines stage 3 for the subscriber certificate
enrolment as specified in 3GPP TS 33.221 [4] which is one realization of the
Ua interface. The subscriber certificate enrolment uses the HTTP Digest based
implementation of bootstrapped security association usage to enrol a
subscriber certificate and the delivery of a CA certificate.

during bootstrapping procedure\ The information consists of a bootstrapping
transaction identifier (B-TID), key material (Ks), and a group of application
specific security parameters related to the subscriber.
**Bootstrapped security association:** association between a UE and a BSF that
is established by running bootstrapping procedure between them. The
association is identified by a bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID)
and consists of bootstrapping information.

within a certificate, called a CA certificate. The CA sign all certificates
that it issues with the private key that corresponds to the public key in the
CA certificate.
**Delivery of CA certificate:** procedure during which UE requests a root
certificate from PKI portal, who delivers the certificate to the UE. The
procedure is secured by using GBA.
**PKI portal:** certification authority (or registration authority) operated
by a cellular operator
**Reverse proxy:** a reverse proxy is a gateway for servers, and enables one
server (i.e., reverse proxy) to provide content from another server
transparently, e.g., when UE\'s request for a particular information is
received at a reverse proxy, the reverse proxy is configured to request the
information from another server. The reverse proxy functionality is
transparent to the UE, i.e., the UE does not know that the request is being
forwarded to another server by the reverse proxy.
**Root certificate:** a certificate that an entity explicitly trusts,
typically a self-signed CA certificate
**Subscriber certificate:** certificate issued to a subscriber\ It contains
the subscriber\'s own public key and possibly other information such as the

# 4 Generic Bootstrapping Architecture; Ub interface
## 4.1 Introduction
Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA) is based on shared secrets provided
by generic bootstrapping architecture (GBA). The stage 2 description of GAA
framework is described in 3GPP TR 33.919 [2] and the GBA procedures in 3GPP TS
33.220 [1].
The GBA related to the Ub interface is between the UE and bootstrapping server
function (BSF). During the bootstrapping procedure BSF also uses the Zh
interface to request authentication vectors from HSS. The Zh interface is
defined in 3GPP TS 29.109 [3]. The end result of the bootstrapping procedure
is that both BSF and an UE have a security association in a form of a
bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) and key material (Ks).
According to 3GPP TS 33.220 [1] the bootstrapping procedure shall be based on
HTTP Digest AKA as described in RFC 3310 [6]. The protocol stack of the Ub
interface in bootstrapping procedure is presented in figure 4.1-1. The details
are defined in the following subclauses.
Figure 4.1-1: Protocol stack of Ub interface
The bootstrapping procedure described in the present document can result to
different key materials depending on whether ME-based or UICC-based GBA is
used. However, the bootstrapping procedure itself is the same for both ME-
based GBA (GBA_ME), and UICC-based GBA (GBA_U).
The bootstrapping procedure can also be based on SIM, i.e., 2G GBA. The 2G GBA
bootstrapping procedure is specified in Annex H.
The bootstrapping procedures can also be based on GBA_Digest. The GBA_Digest
bootstrapping procedures is specified in annex I.
## 4.2 Bootstrapping procedure
The UE shall initiate the bootstrapping procedure when:
a) the UE wants to interact with a NAF and bootstrapping is required;
b) a NAF has requested bootstrapping required indication as described in
subclause 5.2.4 or bootstrapping renegotiation indication as described in
subclause 5.2.5; or
c) the lifetime of the key has expired in the UE if one or more applications
are using that key.
A UE and the BSF shall establish bootstrapped security association between
them by running bootstrapping procedure. Bootstrapping security association
consists of a bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) and key material
Ks. Bootstrapping session on the BSF also includes security related
information about subscriber (e.g. user\'s private identity). Bootstrapping
session is valid for a certain time period, and shall be deleted in the BSF
when the session becomes invalid.
Bootstrapping procedure shall be based on HTTP Digest AKA as described in 3GPP
TS 33.220 [1] and in RFC 3310 [6] with the modifications described below.
The BSF address is derived from the IMPI or IMSI according to 3GPP TS 23.003
[7].
A UE shall indicate to the BSF that it supports the use of TMPI as defined in
3GPP 33.220 [1] by including a \"product\" token in the \"User-Agent\" header
field (cf. RFC 2616 [14]) that is set to a static string \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in
HTTP requests sent to the BSF.
A BSF shall indicate to the UE that it supports the use of TMPI as defined in
3GPP 33.220 [1] by including a \"product\" token in the \"Server\" header
field (cf. RFC 2616 [14]) that is set to a static string \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in
HTTP responses sent to the UE.
In the bootstrapping procedure, Authorization, WWW-Authenticate, and
Authentication-Info HTTP headers shall be used as described in RFC 3310 [6]
with following exceptions:
a) the \"realm\" parameter shall contain the network name where the username
is authenticated;
b) the quality of protection (\"qop\") parameter shall be \"auth-int\"; and
c) the \"username\" parameter shall contain user\'s private identity (IMPI).
NOTE: If the UE does not have an ISIM application with an IMPI, the IMPI will
be constructed from IMSI, according to 3GPP TS 23.003 [7].
In addition to RFC 3310 [6], the following apply:
a) In the initial request from the UE to the BSF, the UE shall include
Authorization header with following parameters:
\- the username directive, set to
1) the value of the TMPI if one has been associated with the private user
identity as described in 3GPP 33.220 [1]; or
2) the value of the private user identity;
\- the realm directive, set to the BSF address derived from the IMPI or IMSI
according to 3GPP TS 23.003 [7];
\- the uri directive, set to either absoluteURL \"http://\/\" or
abs_path \"/\", and which one is used is specified in RFC 2617 [9];
\- the nonce directive, set to an empty value; and
\- the response directive, set to an empty value;
b) In the challenge response from the BSF to the UE, the BSF shall include
parameters to WWW-Authenticate header as specified in RFC 3310 [6] with
following clarifications:
\- the realm directive, set to the BSF address derived from the IMPI or IMSI
according to 3GPP TS 23.003 [7];
c) In the message from the BSF to the UE, the BSF shall include bootstrapping
transaction identifier (B-TID) and the key lifetime to an XML document in the
HTTP response payload. The BSF may also include additional server specific
data to the XML document. The XML schema definition of this XML document is
given in Annex C.
d) When responding to a challenge from the BSF, the UE shall include an
Authorization header containing a realm directive set to the value as received
in the realm directive in the WWW-Authenticate header.
e) Authentication-Info header shall be included into the subsequent HTTP
response after the BSF concluded that the UE has been authenticated.
Authentication-Info header shall include the \"rspauth\" parameter.
After successful bootstrapping procedure the UE and the BSF shall contain the
key material (Ks) and the B-TID. The key material shall be derived from AKA
parameters as specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1]. In addition, BSF shall also
contain a set of security specific attributes related to the UE.
An example flow of successful bootstrapping procedure can be found in clause
A.3.
## 4.3 User authentication failure
If the response returned by the UE is different than expected, the BSF may
challenge the UE again with a new AKA challenge. After N consecutive incorrect
responses from the UE, the BSF shall indicate a failure to the UE. The exact
value of N is defined by local policy.
## 4.4 Network authentication failure
In case the UE fails at authenticating the network, the UE shall abort the
bootstrapping procedure.
## 4.5 Synchronization failure
If the UE considers the sequence number in the challenge not to be in the
correct, the UE shall send a synchronization failure indication back to the
BSF as specified RFC 3310 [6].
An example flow can be found in clause A.4.
# 4A Generic Bootstrapping Achitecture Push; Upa
## 4A.1 Introduction
Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA) is based on shared secrets provided
by generic bootstrapping architecture (GBA). The stage 2 description of GAA
framework is described in 3GPP TR 33.919 [2] and the GBA-Push procedures in
3GPP TS 33.223 [24].
The GBA-Push related to the Upa interface is between a NAF and UE. GBA-Push is
a mechanism to bootstrap the security between a NAF and a UE, without forcing
the UE to contact the BSF to initiate the bootstrapping. GBA-Push is closely
related to and builds upon GBA as specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1]. GBA-Push is
intended for both GBA_U and GBA_ME environments. The end result of the
bootstrapping procedure is that the NAF and the UE have security associations,
called NAF SAs, in the form of unique identifiers for uplink and downlink
references and NAF-key material as defined in 3GPP TS 33.223 [24]. The unique
identifiers take the following forms:
RAND@\'naf\': Identifies NAF SA in the UE (used by NAF).
Value of P-TID: Identifies NAF SA in the NAF (used by UE).
The GBA-Push procedure shall be based on a disposable-Ks model as described in
3GPP TS 33.223 [24]. The protocol stack of the Upa interface in GBA-Push
procedure is presented in figure 4A.1-1. The details are defined in the
following subclauses.
Figure 4A.1-1: Protocol stack of Upa interface
The bootstrapping procedure described in the present document can result in
different key materials depending on whether ME-based or UICC-based GBA is
used. However, the bootstrapping procedure over Upa interface itself is the
same for both ME-based GBA (GBA_ME), and UICC-based GBA (GBA_U).
## 4A.2 Bootstrapping procedure
The Push-NAF may initiate the bootstrapping procedure when:
a) the UE is registered for the intended service; and
b) the UE does not or can not perform a bootstrapping procedure directly with
the BSF.
According to local policy, the Push-NAF may refresh the NAF SA before the
expiry time of the NAF SA.
A Push-NAF and UE shall establish the NAF SA between them by running the
bootstrapping procedure. The NAF SA consists of a NAF SA identifier, NAF-key
material and. additional information as defined in 3GPP TS 33.223 [24]. The
NAF SA is only valid for a certain time period, as determined by the NAF-key
lifetime, and shall be deleted in the Push-NAF when the session expires.
The bootstrapping procedure shall be based on disposable Ks model and GBA-
Push-Info (GPI) as defined in 3GPP TS 33.223 [24]. The Push-NAF pushes the GPI
to the UE. The processing of GPI is defined in 3GPP TS 33.223 [24].
No specific transport method is mandated for transport of the GPI from the
Push-NAF to the UE. However, when using specific transport methods, the
transport address shall be determined as described in table 4A.2.1.
Table 4A.2.1: Transport addresses for Push message from Push-NAF to UE
* * *
Transport Method Transport Address SMS MSISDN MMS MSISDN SIP MESSAGE IMPU UDP
IP-Address
* * *
Annex J specifies the protocol details when using WAP Push via SMS for the
transport of the GPI from the Push-NAF to the UE.
After a successful bootstrapping procedure and processing of the GPI, the UE
and the Push-NAF have established NAF SAs as described in 3GPP TS 33.223 [24].
An example flow of a successful bootstrapping procedure can be found in
subclause A1.3.
## 4A.3 User authentication failure
User authentication is not applicable to GBA Push since all messages over the
Upa interface are network initiated.
## 4A.4 Network authentication failure
In case the UE fails to authenticate the network, the UE shall abort the
bootstrapping procedure.
## 4A.5 Synchronization failure
A disposable Ks model is used for GBA Push in order to avoid many
synchronization problems. One situation when an out-of-synch problem will
appear even with the adoption of the disposable Ks model is when the BSF may
erase a valid Ks while the UE keeps it due to that the GBA Push message can
not be validated at the UE. This will lead to an error situation if the UE
tries to use a NAF specific key (Ks_(ext/int)_NAF) which is derived from such
a Ks.
When this situation occurs, the Push-NAF will receive an error message from
the BSF indicating that the Ks_(ext/int)_NAF (indicated by Bâ€‘TID) is not
available. The Push-NAF shall send this error message to the terminal. Upon
receipt of the error message, indicating that the NAF specific key material is
not available at the BSF, the UE shall perform a new bootstrap.
# 5 Network application function; Ua interface
## 5.1 Introduction
The usage of bootstrapped security association i.e. B-TID and Ks_NAF (or
Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF) over Ua interface depends on the application
protocol used between UE and NAF.
The Ua interface is used to supply the B-TID, generated during the
bootstrapping procedure, to the network application function (NAF), and Zn
interface is used by the NAF to retrieve the Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF or
Ks_int_NAF from BSF. The default is the use of Ks_(ext)_NAF, but the usage of
Ks_int_NAF in Ua interface is possible. The Ua interface depends on type of
NAF. The Zn interface is defined in 3GPP TS 29.109 [3]. This clause describes
how Bâ€‘TID and Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF can be utilized, as specified
in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1], and in the context of more specific Ua usage, as
specified for deployment of HTTPS in 3GPP TS 33.222 [5], or for a PKI portal
in 3GPP TS 33.221 [4]).
## 5.2 HTTP Digest authentication
### 5.2.1 General
The HTTP Digest authentication model as described in RFC 2617 [9] can be used
with bootstrapped security association as the authentication and integrity
protection method, if the application protocol used over Ua interface between
UE and NAF is based on HTTP. The HTTP Digest authentication may be used for
all protocols that have adopted the HTTP authentication framework to mutually
authenticate the UE and the NAF, and also optionally integrity protect any
payload being transferred between them.
The UE shall indicate to an application server (i.e. a NAF) that it supports
3GPP-bootstrapping based HTTP Digest authentication by including a \"product\"
token to the \"User-Agent\" header (cf. RFC 2616 [14]) in outgoing HTTP
requests. If the UE supports
a) AKA based authentication, then the \"product\" token is a static string
\"3gpp-gba\" if the HTTP client application resides in the ME, or \"3gpp-gba-
uicc\" if the HTTP client application resides in the UICC; or
b) GBA_Digest, then the \"product\" token is \"3gpp-gba-digest\".
The UE may indicate multiple GBA modes by inserting multiple \"product\"
tokens in the User-Agent header field. The User-Agent header field with GBA
related \"product\" tokens shall be added to each outgoing HTTP request if the
UE supports GBA-based authentication using HTTP Digest.
Upon receiving GBA related\"product\" tokens, the application server if it
supports NAF functionality may decide to authenticate the UE using GBA-based
shared secret by executing the authentication procedure. If multiple GBA modes
have been indicated in the User-Agent header field, then the NAF selects one
GBA mode and indicates the selected mode in responses to the UE in the
\"realm\" parameter of the WWW-Authenticate header field. In the selection of
the GBA mode by the UE, AKA-based modes shall take priority over GBA_Digest.
The protocol stack of the Ua interface when HTTP Digest authentication is used
is presented in figure 5.2-1. The details are defined in the following
subclauses.
NOTE 1: HTTP is not the only protocol that can be used. Other protocols can
also be used as long as the protocol has adopted the HTTP authentication
framework.
Figure 5.2-1: Protocol stack of Ua interface with HTTP Digest authentication
### 5.2.2 Authentication procedure
#### 5.2.2.1 General
HTTP Digest authentication [9] shall be used with previously bootstrapped
security association as follows:
1) the \"username\" parameter shall be the bootstrapping transaction
identifier (B-TID);
2) the password used in the digest calculations shall be
a) in case of GBA_ME the NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF);
b) in case of GBA_U the NAF specific ME based key material (Ks_ext_NAF) or the
NAF specific UICC-based key material (Ks_int_NAF);and
> c) in case of GBA_Digest the NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF);
NOTE 1: The NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF) is
derived from the key material (Ks) using key derivation function as specified
in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1].
The NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF) is Base64
encoded as specified in RFC 3548 [10].
3 the \"realm\" parameter shall contain two parts delimited by \"@\" sign. The
first part is the constant string \"3GPP-bootstrapping\" (in case of a ME-
based application) , \"3GPP-bootstrapping-uicc\" (in case of a UICC-based
application) or \"3GPP-bootstrapping-digest \" (in case of GBA_Digest), and
the latter part shall be the FQDN of the NAF (e.g. \"3GPP-
bootstrapping\@naf1.operator.com\" or \"3GPP-bootstrapping-
uicc\@naf1.operator.com\" or \"3GPP-bootstrapping-
digest\@naf1.operator.com\").
In the case of GBA_U, the NAF shall indicate to the UE which NAF specific key
was selected to be used by setting the first part of the realm to \"3GPP-
bootstrapping\" (for the ME-based key i.e. Ks_ext_NAF), or to \"3GPP-
bootstrapping-uicc\" (for the UICC-based key i.e. Ks_int_NAF).
Both the UE and the NAF shall verify upon receiving each of the HTTP responses
and HTTP requests that the second part of the realm attribute is equal to the
FQDN of the NAF.
In the case of GBA_U, if the HTTPS client application resides in the ME, then
the application shall use only the ME-based key i.e. Ks_ext_NAF (the UICC-
based key Ks_int_NAF is not available in the ME). If the NAF indicates to the
ME-based HTTPS client application that only UICC-based key shall be used, the
application must terminate the communication with the NAF. If the HTTP client
application resides in the UICC, then the application shall use only the UICC-
based key. If the NAF indicates to the UICC-based application that only ME-
based key shall be used, the application must terminate the communication with
the NAF.
In the case of GBA_U, the operator may indicate the type of the key to be used
in the Ua reference point in the NAF specific USS as specified in 3GPP TS
29.109 [3]. If the NAF has requested an application specific USS, and the
indication is present in the USS, the NAF shall use the indicated key type. If
the type of the negotiated key is different from the type indicated in the
USS, the NAF shall terminate the communication with the UE.
An example flow of a successful HTTP Digest authentication procedure can be
found in clause B.3.
### 5.2.3 Authentication failures
Authentication failures are handled as they are described in RFC 2617 [9].
### 5.2.4 Bootstrapping required indication
NAF shall indicate to the UE that bootstrapped security association is
required by sending an HTTP response with code 401 \"Unauthorized\" and
include the WWW-Authenticate header into the response. In particular, the
\"realm\" attribute shall contain a prefix \"3GPP-bootstrapping@\" or \"3GPP-
bootstrapping-uicc@\" or \"3GPP-bootstrapping-digest\", and this shall trigger
UE to run bootstrapping procedure over Ub interface.
### 5.2.5 Bootstrapping renegotiation indication
The NAF shall indicate to the UE that the existing bootstrapped security
association used in the last HTTP request sent by the UE has expired and that
a new bootstrapped security association is required by sending an HTTP
response described in subclause 5.2.3. When the UE receives the 401
\"Unauthorized\" HTTP response to the HTTP request that was protected using
the existing bootstrapped security association, this shall trigger the UE to
run bootstrapping procedure over Ub interface.
### 5.2.6 Integrity protection
Integrity protection may be provided by using HTTP Digest integrity
protection, i.e. quality of protection (qop) parameter is set to \"auth-int\".
## 5.3 UE and NAF authentication using HTTPS
### 5.3.1 General
Prior to establishing HTTP, the UE and the NAF may perform authentication.
Three different authentication mechanisms may be used for UE and NAF
authentication:
> a) Shared key-based UE authentication (HTTP Digest) with certificate-based
> NAF authentication (TLS);
b) Shared key-based mutual authentication between UE and NAF (PSK TLS), and;
c) Certificate based mutual authentication between UE and AS;
The protocol stack of the Ua interface when TLS is used is presented in figure
5.3.1-1. and described in subclause 5.3.2. The HTTP Digest authentication is
described in subclause 5.2.

### 5.3.2 Shared key-based UE authentication with certificate-based NAF
authentication
#### 5.3.2.1 Authentication procedure
The authentication mechanism described in this section for ME-based
application is mandatory to implement in the ME and optional to implement in
the NAF.
The authentication mechanism described in this section for UICC-based
application is optional to implement in the UICC and the NAF.
The UE and the NAF shall support the TLS version as specified in annex E of
3GPP TS 33.310 [25]. See chapter 5.3.1 in TS 33.222 [5] for the detailed
profiling of TLS.
a) When the UE starts communication via Ua reference point with the NAF, it
shall establish a TLS tunnel with the NAF. The NAF is authenticated to the UE
by means of a public key certificate. The UE shall verify that the server
certificate corresponds to the FQDN of the NAF it established the tunnel with.
No client authentication is performed as part of TLS (no client certificate
necessary).
b) The UE sends an HTTP request to the NAF inside the TLS tunnel (HTTPS, i.e.
HTTP over TLS) as described in chapter 5.2.
c) The NAF shall authenticate the HTTP request using HTTP Digest as specified
in subclause 5.2.
#### 5.3.2.2 Authentication failures
Server authentication failures are handled in TLS as they are described in the
RFC for TLS which is defined in annex E of 3GPP TS 33.310 [25]. Client
authentication failures are handled in HTTP Digest as they are described in
RFC 2617 [9].
#### 5.3.2.3 Bootstrapping required indication
Bootstrapping required indication is done on HTTP Digest and therefore
described in subclause 5.2.4.
#### 5.3.2.4 Bootstrapping renegotiation indication
Bootstrapping renegotiation indication is done on HTTP Digest and therefore
described in subclause 5.2.5.
### 5.3.3 Shared key-based mutual authentication between UE and NAF
#### 5.3.3.1 Authentication procedure
The authentication mechanism described in this section for ME-based
application is optional to implement in the ME and the NAF.
The authentication mechanism described in this section for UICC-based
application is optional to implement in the UICC and the NAF.
The Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for TLS (PSK TLS) may be used with
bootstrapped security association as the authentication, confidentiality, and
integrity protection method. The profile for TLS and TLS Extensions to be used
together with PSK TLS is defined in annex E of 3GPP TS 33.310 [25].
The PSK TLS handshake shall be used with bootstrapped security association as
follows:
\- the ClientHello message shall contain one or more PSK-based ciphersuites;
\- the ClientHello message shall contain the server_name TLS extension and it
shall contain the hostname of the NAF;
\- the ServerHello message shall contain a PSK-based ciphersuite selected by
the NAF;
\- the ServerKeyExchange shall be sent by the server and it shall contain the
psk_identity_hint field and it shall contain the static string
\"3GPPâ€‘bootstrapping\" or \"3GPP-bootstrapping-uicc\" or \"3GPP-bootstrapping-
digest\". If several authentication methods are supported then the
ServerKeyExchange message shall include the PSK-identity hints for all allowed
authentication methods, separated by semi-colon \";\" (e.g., \"3GPP-
bootstrapping;3GPP-bootstrapping-uicc\").
> In the case of GBA_U, the NAF shall indicate to the UE which NAF specific
> key can be used by setting the psk_identity_hint to \"3GPP-bootstrapping\"
> (for the ME-based key i.e. Ks_ext_NAF), or to \"3GPP-bootstrapping-uicc\"
> (for the UICC-based key i.e. Ks_int_NAF). If the NAF allows both types of
> keys to be used then the psk_identity_hint field shall contain both hints
> separated by semi-colon \";\".
In addition, the NAF may include an indication to use a BSF address different
from the one specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [7] in the psk_identity_hint field of
the ServerKeyExchange message. The indication to use the different BSF address
shall contain a prefix \"3GPP bootstrapping-BSF-address\", a separator
character \":\" and the FQDN of the BSF. The NAF may only include this
indication for an application specified to support this functionality (e.g.
Proximity-based Services, see 3GPP TS 33.303 [29]) and if it is included then
the static strings \"3GPP bootstrapping\" shall be included.
> The psk_identity_hint field may contain a list of psk_identity_hints and are
> separated by a semi-colon character (\";\") (see NOTE 1);
NOTE 1: Other psk identity name spaces than \"3GPPâ€‘bootstrapping\" or
\"3GPPâ€‘bootstrapping-uicc\" can be supported, however, they are out of the
scope of this specification.
\- the ClientKeyExchange shall contain the psk_identity field and it shall
contain a prefix \"3GPPâ€‘bootstrapping\" or \"3GPPâ€‘bootstrapping-uicc\" or
\"3GPP-bootstrapping-digest\" indicating the selected psk identity name space,
a separator character \";\" and the B-TID. In the selection of the GBA mode by
the UE, AKA-based modes shall take priority over GBA_Digest.;
\- if the PSK TLS client resides in the ME, the UE shall derive the TLS
premaster secret from the NAF specific key material i.e. Ks_NAF in the case of
GBA_ME. For GBA_U the UE shall derive the TLS premaster secret from the ME-
based key material i.e. Ks_ext_NAF;
\- if the PSK TLS client resides in the UICC, the UE shall derive the TLS
premaster secret from the NAF specific UICC-based key material i.e.
Ks_int_NAF;
\- if the indication to use a different BSF address was included in the
psk_identity_hint field of the ServerKeyExchange message, the ME shall derive
the TLS premaster secret from a Ks_NAF resulting from a GBA_ME bootstrapping
with the indicated BSF and shall use the prefix \"3GPP bootstrapping\" in the
psk_identity field of the ClientKeyExchange message.
NOTE 2: A GBA_U capable NAF indicates to the UE the type of the authorized NAF
specific key (i.e. (Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF or both). The details of the key
decision mechanism in the NAF are specified in 3GPP TS 29.109 [3].
In the case of GBA_U, if the HTTPS client application resides in the ME then
the application shall use only the ME-based key i.e. Ks_ext_NAF (the UICC-
based key Ks_int_NAF is not available in the ME). If a NAF indicates to a ME-
based HTTPS client application that the UICC-based key shall be used then the
application must terminate the communication with this NAF. If a HTTPS client
application resides in the UICC, then the application shall only use the UICC-
based key. If the NAF indicates to the UICC-based application that only the
ME-based key can be used then the application must terminate the communication
with the NAF.
In the case of GBA_U, the operator may indicate the type of the key to be used
in the Ua reference point in the NAF specific USS as specified in 3GPP TS
29.109 [3]. If the NAF has requested an application specific USS, and the
indication is present in the USS, the NAF shall use the indicated key type. If
the type of the negotiated key is different from the type indicated in the
USS, the NAF shall terminate the communication with the UE.
An example flow of the PSK TLS procedure can be found in clause F.3.
#### 5.3.3.2 Authentication failures
Authentication failures are handled as they are described in the profile for
TLS specified in annex E of 3GPP TS 33.310 [25].
#### 5.3.3.3 Bootstrapping required indication
During TLS handshake, the NAF shall indicate to the UE that bootstrapped
security association is required by sending a ServerHello message containing a
PSK-based ciphersuite, and a ServerKeyExchange message containing the
psk_identity_hint field, which contains a static string \"3GPP-bootstrapping\"
or \"3GPP-bootstrapping-uicc\" or \"3GPP-bootstrapping-digest\". This shall
trigger the UE to run the bootstrapping procedure over Ub interface.
NOTE: The NAF shall select a PSK-based ciphersuite only if the UE has offered
one or more PSK-based ciphersuites in the corresponding ClientHello message.
#### 5.3.3.4 Bootstrapping renegotiation indication
During usage of TLS session, the NAF shall indicate to the UE that
bootstrapped security association has expired by sending close_notify alert
message to the UE. The UE may attempt resume the old TLS session by sending a
ClientHello message containing the old session ID. The NAF shall refuse to use
the old session ID by sending a ServerHello message with a new session ID.
This will indicate to the UE that the bootstrapped security association it
used has expired.
During TLS handshake, the NAF shall indicate to the UE that the bootstrapped
security association has expired by sending handshake_failure message as a
response to the Finished message sent by the UE. This will indicate to the UE
that the bootstrapped security association it used has expired.
### 5.3.4 Certificate based mutual authentication between UE and application
server
The authentication mechanism described in this clause is optional to implement
in the UE and in the application server.
The certificate based mutual authentication between an UE and an application
server shall be based on TLS and TLS Extensions. The profile for TLS and TLS
Extensions is defined in annex E of 3GPP TS 33.310 [25].
Annex B in TS 33.222 [5] provides guidance on certificate mutual
authentication between UE and application server.
### 5.3.5 Integrity protection
Integrity protection is provided by using authenticated TLS tunnel as
described in RFC 2818 [12].
# 6 PKI portal, Ua interface
## 6.1 Introduction
3GPP TS 33.221 [4] specifies the enrolment of subscriber certificates and the
delivery of CA certificates to the UE. The TS specifies that the
authentication of these procedures be based on bootstrapping procedure and
more generally on the HTTP Digest authentication as described in subclause 5.2
of the present document.
## 6.2 Subscriber certificate enrolment
The subscriber certificate enrolment procedure contains the following
requests:
\- an enrolment request in the form of PKCS#10 [16];
\- an optional request for WIM specific authentication code for key generation
[19]; and
\- an optional request for WIM specific authentication code for proof of key
origin [19].
Respectively, the subscriber certificate enrolment procedure contains the
following responses:
\- a subscriber certificate; and
\- a WIM specific authentication code [19].
NOTE: The on board key generation and the generation of the proof of key
origin requires a WIM specific authentication code. Whether it is, is decided
by the issuer of the WIM card.
### 6.2.1 Enrolment procedure
The UE shall generate a PKCS#10 certification request [16] according to 3GPP
TS 33.221 [4]. The UE shall send the PKCS#10 certification request to the PKI
portal in the HTTP payload in a HTTP POST request. The Request-URI shall
indicate the desired response type. Upon successful enrolment, PKI portal
shall return the enrolled subscriber certificate in the desired format.
The UE populates the HTTP POST request as follows:
\- the HTTP version shall be 1.1 which is specified in RFC 2616 [14];
\- the base of the Request-URI is extracted from the full PKI portal URI (e.g.
if the full PKI portal URI is \"http://pki-portal.operator.com/enrol\" then
the Request-URI shall be \"/enrol\".
NOTE 1: In case a proxy is used between the UE and the PKI portal, then the
full Request-URI will be used in the HTTP Post request.
\- the Request-URI shall contain an URI parameter \"response\" that shall be
set to \"single\", \"pointer\", or \"chain\" depending on the UE\'s desired
response type (e.g. Request-URI may take the form of
\"/enrol?response=single\" for certificate delivery);
NOTE 2: The PKI portal might ignore the UE\'s desired response type, and the
UE should be capable of receiving the issued subscriber certificate in any of
the response types.
\- the UE may add additional URI parameters to the Request-URI;
NOTE 3: The PKI portal might ignore the additional URI parameters.
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be \"application/x-pkcs10\";
\- the HTTP header Content-Length shall be the length of the Base64 encoded
PKCS#10 certification request in Octets; and
\- the HTTP payload shall contain the Base64 encoded PKCS#10 certification
request and optionally surrounded by \"----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST -----\"
and \"----- END CERTIFICATE REQUEST \-----\" tags;
\- the UE may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP POST request.
The UE sends the HTTP POST request to the PKI portal. The PKI portal checks
that the HTTP request is valid, and extracts the Base64 encoded PKCS#10
certification request for further processing. The PKI portal shall verify that
the subscriber is authorized to receive the particular type of certificate by
checking subscriber\'s user security settings received from the BSF as
specified 3GPP TS 33.220 [1].
Upon successful subscriber certificate creation procedure, the PKI portal
shall return the subscriber certificate to the UE in the UE\'s desired format
or in the PKI portal\'s desired format.
The response format type shall be one of the following:
\- the subscriber certificate itself (i.e. desired response type was
\"single\");
\- a pointer to the subscriber certificate (i.e. desired response type was
\"pointer\"); or
\- a certificate chain that contains full certification chain from subscriber
certificate to the root certificate (i.e. desired response type was
\"chain\").
If response format type is \"single\", the PKI portal shall populate HTTP
response as follows:
\- the HTTP status code shall be 200;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be \"application/x-x509-user-cert\";
\- the HTTP header Content-Length shall be the length of the HTTP payload in
octets;
\- the HTTP payload shall contain the Base64 encoded subscriber certificate
and optionally surrounded by\ \"----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE -----\" and \"-----
END CERTIFICATE -----\" tags;
\- the PKI portal may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP response.
If response format type is \"pointer\", the PKI portal shall populate HTTP
response as follows:
\- the HTTP status code shall be 200;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be \"application/vnd.wap.cert-
response\";
\- the HTTP header Content-Length shall be the length of the HTTP payload in
octets;
\- the HTTP payload shall contain the Base64 encoded CertResponse structure
and optionally surrounded by\ \"----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE RESPONSE -----\" and
\"----- END CERTIFICATE RESPONSE -----\" tags;
\- the PKI portal may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP response.
If response format type is \"chain\", the PKI portal shall populate HTTP
response as follows:
\- the HTTP status code shall be 200;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be \"application/pkix-pkipath\";
\- the HTTP header Content-Length shall be the length of the HTTP payload in
octets;
\- the HTTP payload shall contain the Base64 encoded PkiPath structure;
\- the PKI portal may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP response.
The PKI portal shall send the HTTP response to the UE. The UE shall check that
the HTTP response is valid, and extract the Base64 encoded subscriber
certificate, pointer to the subscriber certificate, or certificate chain for
further processing.
An example flow of a successful subscriber certificate enrolment procedure can
be found in clause E.3.
### 6.2.2 WIM specific authentication code for key generation
The UE may be equipped with a WIM which may require an authentication code
from WIM provider in order to generate a key onboard WIM as specified in OMA
ECMAScript [19] and OMA WPKI [20] specifications. In this case, the UE shall
request the authentication code from PKI portal using a HTTP GET request. If
the PKI portal can acquire authentication code, it is returned to the UE in
the corresponding HTTP response.
The UE populates the HTTP GET request as follows:
\- the HTTP version shall be 1.1 which is specified in RFC 2616 [14];
\- the base of the Request-URI is extracted from the full PKI portal URI and
appended with \"/wim-auth-code\" (e.g. if the full PKI portal URI is
\"http://pki-portal.operator.com/enrol\" then the Request-URI shall be
\"/enrol/wim-auth-code\");
\- the Request-URI shall contain an URI parameter \"request\" that shall be
set to the return value received from the WIM;
NOTE 1: If an authentication code is required, the WIM will return
\"error:AuthReq:cardSerialNumber:Challenge\". The cardSerialNumber and the
Challenge are in a hexadecimal format as specified in OMA ECMAScript
specification [19].
\- the UE may add additional URI parameters to the Request-URI;
\- the UE may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP GET request.
The UE sends the HTTP GET request to the PKI portal. The PKI portal
acknowledges that this is an authentication code because the Request-URI
contains the \"/wim-auth-code\" and the URI parameter \"request\". The PKI
portal extracts the authentication code derivation parameters from the URI
parameter \"request\", and derives the authentication code.
NOTE 2: The actual derivation of the authentication code is outside the scope.
Upon successful authentication code derivation, the PKI portal shall return
the authentication code to the UE in a HTTP response:
\- the HTTP status code shall be 200;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be \"text/plain\";
\- the HTTP header Content-Length shall be the length of the HTTP payload in
octets;
\- the HTTP payload shall contain the authentication code in a hexadecimal
format;
\- the PKI portal may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP response.
Upon receiving the authentication code from the PKI portal, the UE shall use
it to authenticate the procedure of generating the key onboard the WIM.
### 6.2.3 WIM specific authentication code for proof of key origin
The UE may be equipped with a WIM which may require an authentication code
from WIM provider in order to generate a proof of key origin onboard WIM as
specified in OMA ECMAScript [19] and OMA WPKI [20] specifications. In this
case, the UE shall request the authentication code from PKI portal using a
HTTP GET request. If the PKI portal can acquire authentication code, it is
returned to the UE in the corresponding HTTP response.
The procedure to obtain the authentication code for the generation of proof of
key origin onboard WIM is the same as for the key generation, and is described
in subclause D.2.1.
Upon receiving the authentication code from the PKI portal, the UE shall use
it to authenticate the procedure generating the proof of key origin onboard
the WIM.
### 6.2.4 Error situations
Subscriber certificate enrolment may not be successful for multiple reasons.
The error cases are indicated by using 4xx and 5xx HTTP Status Codes as
defined in RFC 2616 [14]. The 4xx status code indicates that the UE seems to
have erred, and the 5xx status code indicates that the PKI portal is aware
that it has erred. Possible error situations during subscriber certificate
enrolment and their mappings to HTTP Status Codes are described in table
6.2.4-1.
NOTE: On the table 6.2.4-1, the \"Description\" column describes the error
situation in PKI portal. The \"PKI portal error\" column describes the typical
reason for the error.
An example flow of a failure in subscriber certificate enrolment procedure can
be found in clause E.4.

support the HTTP protocol version that was used in the request line UE should
use HTTP/1.1 version with PKI portal
* * *
## 6.3 CA certificate delivery
The root certificate delivery procedure contains the following request:
\- a CA certificate delivery request;
and the corresponding response:
\- the CA certificate.
### 6.3.1 CA certificate delivery procedure
The UE shall populate the HTTP GET request as follows:
\- the HTTP version shall be 1.1 which is specified in RFC 2616 [14];
\- the base of the Request-URI is extracted from the full PKI portal URI (e.g.
if the full PKI portal URI is \"http://pki-
portal.operator.com/getcertificate\" then the Request-URI shall be
\"/getcertificate\".
NOTE 1: In case a proxy is used between the UE and the PKI portal, then the
full Request-URI will be used in the HTTP Post request.
\- the Request-URI shall contain an URI parameter \"in\" that shall be the
Base64 encoding of the DER encoded Issuer field of the X.509 certificate;
\- the Request-URI may contain an URI parameter \"ki\" that shall be the
Base64 encoding of the DER encoded the Key Identifier of the X.509
certificate;
NOTE 2: Key Identifier of the CA certificate can be obtained from the
Authority Key Identifier extension of the subscriber certificate.
\- the UE may add additional URI parameters to the Request-URI;
\- the UE may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP GET request.
The UE sends the HTTP GET request to the PKI portal. The PKI portal checks
that the HTTP request is valid, and extracts the \"in\" parameter and
optionally \"ki\" parameter from the Request-URI. If the PKI portal can verify
that the Issuer field parameter is valid, and that the UE may set the CA
certificate as a root certificate (i.e. trusted CA certificate), it will then
send the CA certificate back to the UE in the corresponding HTTP response.
The PKI portal shall populate the HTTP response as follows:
\- the HTTP status code shall be 200;
\- the HTTP header Content-Type shall be \"application/x-x509-ca-cert\";
\- the HTTP header Content-Length shall be the length of the HTTP payload in
octets;
\- the HTTP payload shall contain the Base64 encoded CA certificate structure
and optionally surrounded by \"â€‘â€‘â€‘â€‘â€‘ BEGIN CERTIFICATE \-----\" and \"-----
END CERTIFICATE -----\" tags;
\- the PKI portal may add additional HTTP headers to the HTTP response.
The PKI portal shall send the HTTP response to the UE. The UE shall check that
the HTTP response is valid, and extract the Base64 encoded CA certificate for
further processing. UE shall validate and match the received CA certificate
against the parameters supplied in the corresponding request.
An example flow of CA certificate procedure can be found in clause E.5.
### 6.3.2 Error situations
CA certificate delivery may not be successful for multiple reasons. The error
cases are indicates by using 4xx and 5xx HTTP Status Codes as defined in RFC
2616 [14]. The 4xx status code indicates that the UE seems to have erred, and
the 5xx status codes indicate that the PKI portal is aware that it has erred.
Possible error situations during CA certificate delivery and their mappings to
HTTP Status Codes are described in table 6.3.2-1.
NOTE: On the table 6.3.2-1, the \"Description\" column describes the error
situation in PKI portal. The \"PKI portal error\" column describes the typical
reason for the error.

# 7 Authentication Proxy
## 7.1 Introduction
The use of authentication proxy (AP) is specified in 3GPP TS 33.222 [5]. The
AP in GAA is used to separate the GAA specific authentication procedure and
the Application Server (AS) specific application logic to different logical
entities. The AP is configured as a HTTP reverse proxy, i.e. the FQDN of the
AS is configured to the AP such a way that the IP traffic intended to the AS
is directed to the AP by the network. The AP performs the GAA authentication
of the UE. After the GAA authentication procedure has been successfully
completed, the AP assumes the typical role of a reverse proxy, i.e. the AP
forwards HTTP requests originating from the UE to the correct AS, and returns
the corresponding HTTP responses from the AS to the originating UE.
## 7.2 Authentication
The authentication of the UE shall be based on GAA as specified in clause 5.
The AP shall remove the \"Authorization\" header from the HTTP requests that
are forwarded from the UE to the AS. The AP shall add the \"Authentication-
Info\" header to the HTTP responses that are forwarded to the UE from the AS.
The UE may indicate the user identity intended to be used with the AS by
adding a HTTP header to the outgoing HTTP requests. The HTTP header name shall
be \"X-3GPP-Intended-Identity\" and it shall contain the user identity
surrounded by quotation marks (\"). If the HTTP header has been added, the AP
may verify that the user identity belongs to the subscriber. In case the AP
supports this check of the user identity then it shall be performed dependant
on the subscriber's application specific or AP specific user security
settings.
## 7.3 Authorization
The AP shall be able to decide whether particular subscriber, i.e. the UE, is
authorized to access a particular AS. The granularity of the authorization
procedures is specified in 3GPP TS 33.222 [5].
The AP may indicate an asserted identity or a list of identities to the AS by
adding a HTTP header to the HTTP requests coming from the UE and forwarded to
the AS. The HTTP header name shall be \"X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity\" and it
shall contain a list of identities separated by comma (,) and each identity is
surrounded by quotation marks (\"). Whether the AP supports this handling of
an asserted identity or a list of identities then it shall depend on local
policy in the AP. In addition the subscriber's application specific or AP
specific user security settings may be considered.
The AP may indicate an authorization flag or a list of authorization flags
from the application specific user security settings (USS) to the AS by adding
a HTTP header to the HTTP requests coming from the UE and forwarded to the AS.
The HTTP header name shall be \"X-3GPP-Authorization-Flags\" and it shall
contain a list of authorization flags separated by comma (,) and each
authorization flag is surrounded by quotation marks (\"). In case the AP
supports this handling of authorization flags from USS then it shall depend on
local policy in the AP.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Signalling flows of bootstrapping procedure
# A.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for bootstrapping procedure.
# A.2 Introduction
## A.2.1 General
Bootstrapping procedure is executed in order to establish bootstrapped
security association, i.e. bootstrapping session between an UE and the BSF.
The bootstrapping session is used between a UE and a NAF. An example usage of
it is described in annex B.
## A.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
3GPP TS 24.228 [13], subclause 4.1.1, specifies the key required to interpret
the contents of the SIP methods. This key is used with HTTP based messages
(cf. RFC 2616 [14]) as well since SIP and HTTP messages resemble each other in
structure. The following key rules are used in addition to those specified in
3GPP TS 24.228 [13]:
a) The HTTP based messaging is always initiated by the client:
\- HTTP request is generated by the client (i.e. UE);
\- HTTP response is generated by the server as a response to the HTTP request;
\- HTTP proxies may be between the client and the server.
b) There is only one single HTTP response to the HTTP request.
c) In order to differentiate between HTTP messages and other protocol
messages, the HTTP messages are marked with simple arrow line, and all _non-
HTTP_ messages with block arrows.
d) The flows show the signalling exchanges between the following functional
entities in addition to those specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 [13]:
\- Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF);
\- Network Application Function (NAF);
\- PKI portal (PKI portal).
e) The \"(B-TID)\" sequence of characters is used to indicate that the
bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) needs to be filled in.
# A.3 Signalling flows demonstrating a successful bootstrapping procedure
The overall bootstrapping procedure in successful case is presented in figure
A.3-1. The bootstrapping Zh interface performs the retrieval of an
authentication vector by BSF from the HSS. The procedure corresponds to the
step 2 in figure A.3-1.
This clause specifies in detail the format of the bootstrapping procedure that
is further utilized by various applications. It contains the AKA
authentication procedure with BSF, and later the bootstrapping key material
generation procedure.
Figure **A.3** -1: Bootstrapping signalling
1\. **Initial GET request (UE to BSF) - see example in table A.3-1**
The purpose of this message is to initiate bootstrapping procedure between the
UE and BSF. The UE sends an HTTP request containing the private user identity
towards its home BSF.
Table **A.3** -1: Initial GET request (UE to BSF)
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: bsf.home1.net:80
User-Agent: Bootstrapping Client Agent; Release-6; 3gpp-gba-tmpi
Date: Thu, 08 Jan 2004 10:13:17 GMT
Accept: */*
Authorization: Digest
username=\"user1_private\@home1.net\",
realm=\"bsf.home1.net\",
nonce=\"\",
uri=\"/\",
response=\"\"
**Request-URI:** The Request-URI (the URI that follows the method name,
\"GET\", in the first line) indicates the resource indication of this GET
request. For bootstrapping server, this is by default \"/\".
**Host:** Specifies the Internet host and port number of the BSF server,
derived from the private user identity or IMSI according to 3GPP TS 23.003
[7], or obtained from the original URI given by referring resource. The port
number to be used with Ub reference point is the default port of HTTP, i.e.
80.
**User-Agent:** Contains information about the user agent originating the
request.
**Date:** Represents the date and time at which the message was originated.
**Accept:** Media types which are acceptable for the response.
**Authorization:** It carries authentication information. The private user
identity (user1_private\@home1.net) is carried in the username field of the
Digest AKA protocol. The \"uri\" parameter (directive) contains the same value
as the Request-URI. The "realm" parameter (directive) contains the network
name where the username is authenticated. The Host and the \"realm\" parameter
(directive) value are obtained from the same field in the USIM and therefore,
are identical. In this example, it is assumed that a new UICC card was just
inserted into the terminal, and there is no other cached information to send.
Therefore, \"nonce\" and \"response\" parameters (directives) are empty.
2\. **Zh: Authentication procedure**
BSF retrieves the corresponding AVs from the HSS.
For detailed signalling flows see 3GPP TS 29.109 [3].
Table **A.3** -2: BSF authentication information procedure (BSF to HSS)
* * *
Message source and destination Zh Information element name Information Source
in GET Description BSF to HSS Private User Identity Authorization: The Private
User Identity is encoded in the username field according to the Authorization
protocol.
* * *
3\. **Authentication vector selection**
The BSF selects an authentication vector for use in the authentication
challenge. For detailed description of the authentication vector, see 3GPP TS
33.220 [1].
NOTE 1: The authentication vector can be of the form as in 3GPP TS 33.203 [21]
(if IMS AKA is the selected authentication scheme):
\- AV = RAND~n~\|\|AUTN~n~\|\|XRES~n~\|\|CK~n~\|\|IK~n~ where:
  * RAND: random number used to generate the XRES, CK, IK, and part of > the AUTN. It is also used to generate the RES at the UE.
  * AUTN: Authentication token (including MAC and SQN); 128 bit value > generated by the HSS.
  * XRES: Expected (correct) result from the UE.
  * CK: Cipher key (optional).
  * IK: Integrity key.
4\. **401 Unauthorized response (BSF to UE) - see example in table A.3-3**
BSF forwards the challenge to the UE in HTTP 401 Unauthorized response
(without the CK, IK and XRES). This is to demand the UE to authenticate
itself. The challenge contains RAND and AUTN that are populated in nonce field
according to RFC 3310 [6].
Table **A.3** -3: 401 Unauthorized response (BSF to UE)
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

**Server:** Contains information about the software used by the origin server
(BSF).
**Date:** Represents the date and time at which the message was originated.
**WWW-Authenticate:** The BSF challenges the user. The nonce includes the
quoted string, base64 encoded value of the concatenation of the AKA RAND, AKA
AUTN and server specific data.
NOTE 2: The actual nonce value in the WWW-Authenticate header field is encoded
in base64, and it can look like: nonce=\"A34Cm+Fva37UYWpGNB34JP\".
5\. **Generation of response and session keys at UE**
Upon receiving the Unauthorized response, the UE extracts the MAC and the SQN
from the AUTN. The UE calculates the XMAC and checks that XMAC matches the
received MAC and that the SQN is in the correct range. If both these checks
are successful the UE calculates the authentication challenge response (using
RES and other parameters as defined in RFC 3310 [6]), and also computes the
session keys IK and CK. The authentication challenge response is put into the
Authorization header and sent back to the BSF in the GET request.
6\. **GET request (UE to BSF) - see example in table A.3-4**
The UE sends an HTTP GET request again, with the RES, which is used for
response calculation, to the BSF.
Table **A.3** -4: GET request (UE to BSF)
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: bsf.home1.net:80

**Authorization:** This carries the response to the authentication challenge
received in step 4 and contains the private user identity, the realm, the
nonce, the URI, the qop, the NC, the cnonce, the response, the opaque, and the
algorithm.
7\. **Authentication and generation of key material at BSF**
Upon receiving an integrity protected GET request carrying the authentication
challenge response, the BSF checks that the expected response (calculated by
the BSF using XRES and other parameter as defined in RFC 3310 [6]) matches the
received challenge response. If the check is successful then the user has been
authenticated and the private user identity is registered in the BSF.

8\. **200 OK response (BSF to UE) - see example in table A.3-5**
The BSF sends 200 OK response to the UE to indicate the success of the
authentication.

The header includes the \"rspauth\" parameter, which is calculated as
specified in RFC 2617 [9] using RES for response calculation as specified in
RFC 3310 [6].
**Expires:** Gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale.
9\. **Generation of key material at UE**
The key material Ks is generated in UE by concatenating CK and IK. In the case
of GBA_ME, the ME stores the tuple \, and in the case of GBA_U, the
UICC stores the tuple \.
NOTE 3: The NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF in the case of GBA_ME, or
Ks_ext_NAF and Ks_int_NAF in the case of GBA_U) is derived from Ks during the
Ua interface procedures, and is used for securing the Ua interface. In the
case of GBA_ME, the ME stores the tuple \ and in the case of
GBA_U, the ME stores the tuple \, and the UICC stores the
tuple \.
For detailed bootstrapping key material generation procedure for NAF specific
key (Ks_NAF, Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF) see 3GPP TS 33.220 [1].
# A.4 Signalling flows demonstrating a synchronization failure in the
bootstrapping procedure
If the UE considers the sequence number in the challenge to be not in the
correct range, it sends a synchronization failure indication back to BSF. The
parameter AUTS contains the concealed value of the counter value SQN~MS~ in
the UE.
Figure A.4-1: The bootstrapping procedure in sequence number synchronization
failure case.
1-4. **Initial bootstrapping steps**
Steps 1 through 4 are described in the corresponding steps in clause A.3.
5\. **SQN invalid, generate AUTS at UE**
The UE identifies the sequence number is out of synchronization. The UE
generates the AUTS parameter (112 bit value). The AUTS parameter is populated
in Authorization header, as specified in RFC 3310 [6].
6\. **GET request (UE to BSF) - see example in table A.4-1**
The UE sends HTTP GET request, with the AUTS parameter to the BSF.

###### ## Annex A1 (informative): Signalling flows of GBA Push procedure
# A1.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for the GBA Push procedure.
# A1.2 Introduction
## A1.2.1 General
The GBA Push procedure is executed in order to establish a bootstrapped
security association, i.e. bootstrapping session between a Push-NAF and a UE.
## A1.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The detailed message contents are not shown in the flows for this subclause as
they are not necessarily transported using a text based mechanism. The details
for the message contents can be found in 3GPP TS 33.223 [24].
The flows show the signalling exchanges between the following functional
entities:
\- User Equipment (UE);
\- Push-Network Application Function (P-NAF);
\- Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF);
\- Home Subscriber Server (HSS).
# A1.3 Signalling flows demonstrating a successful GBA Push procedure
The overall GBA Push procedure in the successful case is presented in figure
A1.3-1. The bootstrapping interface Zh performs the retrieval of an

NAF SA.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Signalling flows for HTTP Digest
Authentication with bootstrapped security association
# B.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for using HTTP Digest
Authentication with bootstrapped security association.
# B.2 Introduction
## B.2.1 General
A bootstrapping session established using a bootstrapping procedure (cf.
clause 4 and annex A) is used between a UE and a NAF. The BSF provides to the
NAF a NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF and optionally
Ks_int_NAF) which is derived from the key material (Ks). The NAF uses this key
to authenticate and optionally secure (i.e. integrity protect and encrypt) the
communications between it and the UE. The BSF will also provide the NAF the
expiration time of the bootstrapping session. When the bootstrapping session
becomes invalid the NAF will stop using the session, and indicate to the UE
that bootstrapping session has expired and that new session needs to be
established.
An example of the signalling flows of the authentication procedure using HTTP
Digest authentication [9] is given in clause B.3.
## B.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The key to interpret signalling flows is specified in subclause A.2.2.
# B.3 Signalling flows demonstrating a successful authentication procedure
The signalling flow in figure B.3-1 describes the generic message exchange
between UE and NAF using HTTP Digest Authentication. In this example, the
HTTPS client application resides in the ME, i.e., either Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF
is used as the key. The conversation can take place inside a server-
authenticated TLS (as described in the RFC for TLS defined in annex E of 3GPP
TS 33.310 [25]) tunnel in which case TLS session has been established before
step 1.
Figure B.3-1: HTTP Digest Authentication with bootstrapped security
association
1\. **GET request (UE to NAF) - see example in table B.3-1**
The UE sends an HTTP request to a NAF to gain access to a service.
Table **B.3** -1: Initial GET request (UE to NAF)
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: naf1.home1.net:1234
User-Agent: NAF1 Application Agent; Release-6 3gpp-gba

Accept: */*
Referer: http://naf1.home1.net:1234/service
X-3GPP-Intended-Identity: \"user\@as1.home1.net\"
**Request-URI:** The Request-URI (the URI that follows the method name,
\"GET\", in the first line) indicates the resource indication of this GET
request.
**Host:** Specifies the Internet host and port number of the NAF server,
obtained from the original URI given by referring resource.
**User-Agent:** Contains information about the user agent originating the
request and it includes the static string \"3gpp-gba\" to indicate to the
application server (i.e. NAF) that the UE supports 3GPP-bootstrapping based
authentication.
**Date:** Represents the date and time at which the message was originated.
**Accept:** Media types which are acceptable for the response.
**Referer:** Allows the user agent to specify the address (URI) of the
resource from which the URI for the NAF was obtained.
NOTE 1: This step can also be a POST request in which case the request would
contain a client payload in the HTTP request and the corresponding Content-
Type and Content-Length header values.
2\. **401 Unauthorized response (NAF to UE) - see example in table B.3-2**
Upon receiving an HTTP request that contains static string \"3gpp-gba\" in the
User-Agent header, NAF can choose to authenticate the UE using bootstrapped
security association. If NAF chooses to authenticate the UE using bootstrapped
security association, it responds with HTTP response code 401 \"Unauthorized\"
which contains a WWW-Authenticate header. The header instructs the UE to use
HTTP Digest Authentication with a bootstrapped security association.

>
> The realm attribute contains two parts delimited by \"@\" sign. The first
> part is a constant string \"3GPP-bootstrapping\" instructing the UE to use a

3\. **Generation of NAF specific keys at UE**
UE verifies that the second part of the realm attribute does correspond to the
server it is talking to. In particular, if the conversation is taking place
inside a server-authenticated TLS tunnel, the UE shall verify that the server
name in the server\'s TLS certificate matches the server name in the realm
attribute of the WWW-Authenticate header.
UE derives the NAF specific key material Ks_(ext)_NAF as specified in 3GPP TS
33.220 [1].
NOTE 2: If UE does not have a bootstrapped security association available, it
obtains one by running bootstrapping procedure over Ub interface
4\. **GET request (UE to NAF) - see example in table B.3-3**
UE generates the HTTP request by calculating the Authorization header values
using the bootstrapping transaction identifier **B-** TID it received from the
BSF as the username and the NAF specific key material Ks_(ext)_NAF (base64
encoded) as the password, and sends the request to NAF.
Table **B.3** -3: GET request (UE to NAF)
GET / HTTP/1.1

**Authorization:** This carries the response to the authentication challenge
received in step 2 along with the username, the realm, the nonce, the URI, the
qop, the NC, the cnonce, the response, the opaque, and the algorithm.
**The qop attribute is set to \"auth-int\" by default. If the conversation is
taking place inside a server-authenticated TLS tunnel, the qop attribute can
be set to \"auth\" as well.**
NOTE 3: If step 1 was a POST request then this request would also be POST
request and contain the same client payload in the HTTP request as was carried
in step 1.
5\. **Zn: NAF specific key procedure**
NAF retrieves the NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF) from the
BSF.
In the case that the HTTPS client resides in the UICC, then the NAF needs to
retrieve Ks_int_NAF.
If the NAF retrieved an application-specific USS and it contained a keyChoice
indication, the NAF must enforce this indication. Hence, if the UICC-based key
was indicated the NAF must terminate the communication with the UE in this
phase.
NOTE 4: If the local configuration in the NAF restricts the access to the
service to UICC-based applications using only Ks_int_NAF, then the NAF will
terminate the communication with the UE in this phase.
For detailed signalling flows see 3GPP TS 29.109 [3].

BSF)

* * *
6\. **Authentication at NAF**
NAF verifies the Authorization header by using the bootstrapping transaction
identifier B-TID and the key material Ks_(ext)_NAF obtained from BSF. NAF
calculates the corresponding digest values using Ks_(ext)_NAF, and compares
the calculated values with the received values in the Authorization header.
The NAF also verifies that the DNS name in the realm attribute matches its
own. If the conversation is taking place inside a server-authenticated TLS
tunnel, the NAF shall also verify that this DNS name is the same as that of
the TLS server certificate.
If the verification succeeds, the incoming client-payload request is taken in
for further processing.
7\. **200 OK response (NAF to UE) - see example in table B.3-5**
The NAF sends 200 OK response to the UE to indicate the success of the
authentication. NAF generates a HTTP response containing the server-payload it
wants to send back to the UE. The NAF can use key material Ks_(ext)_NAF to
integrity protect and authenticate the response.

###### ## Annex D (informative): Signalling flows for Authentication Proxy
# D.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for using AP in GAA.
# D.2 Introduction
A bootstrapping session (established using a bootstrapping procedure, cf.
clause 4 and annex A) is used between a UE and an authentication proxy (AP)
that is functioning as a NAF. The BSF provides to the AP an AP specific key
material (Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF and optionally Ks_int_NAF), which is derived
from the key material (Ks). The AP uses this key to authenticate and
optionally secure (i.e. integrity protect with HTTP Digest using \"auth-int\"
qop option, or integrity protect and encrypt with PSK TLS) the communications
between it and the UE. The BSF will also provide the AP the expiration time of
the bootstrapping session. When the bootstrapping session becomes invalid the
AP will stop using the session, and indicate to the UE that bootstrapping
session has expired and that new session needs to be established.
The AP functions as a reverse proxy. After the AP has authenticated and
optionally secured the communcation between it and the UE, the AP will forward
the incoming HTTP requests from the UE to the correct appliation server (AS)
behind the AP. There can be multiple application servers behind the AP.
NOTE: As consequence of the fact that the UE assumes it is communicating with
the AS, not the AP, the AP might need to use different NAF specific keys per
UE because (i) the UE will use the hostname of the AS (i.e., NAF_ID) when
deriving the NAF specific key, (ii) the AP is doing virtual name based
hosting, i.e., has reverse proxy functionality, and (iii) the UE can
communicate through the AP with several ASes at the same time.
An example of the signalling flows of the authentication procedure between a
UE, an AP, and an AS is given in clause D.3.
## D.2.1 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The key to interpret signalling flows specified in subclause A.2.2.
# D.3 Signalling flow demonstrating a successful authentication procedure
The signalling flow in figure D.3-1 describes the generic message exchange
between a UE, a AP, and an AS using HTTP. In this example, the HTTP client
application resides in the ME, i.e., either Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF is used as
the key. The conversation between the UE and the AP can take place inside a
server-authenticated TLS (as described in the RFC for TLS defined in annex E
of 3GPP TS 33.310 [25]) tunnel in which case TLS session has been established
before step 1.
Figure D.3-1: Successful authentiation with AP and AS
1\. **GET request (UE to AP) - see example in table D.3-1**
The UE sends an HTTP request to a AP to gain access to a service.
Table **D.3** -1: Initial GET request (UE toAP)
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: as1.home1.net:1234
User-Agent: NAF1 Application Agent; Release-6 3gpp-gba
Date: Thu, 08 Jan 2004 10:50:35 GMT
Accept: */*
Referer: http://as1.home1.net:1234/service
**Request-URI:** The Request-URI (the URI that follows the method name,
\"GET\", in the first line) indicates the resource indication of this GET
request.
**Host:** Specifies the Internet host and port number of the AS, obtained from
the original URI given by referring resource.
**User-Agent:** Contains information about the user agent originating the
request and it includes the static string \"3gpp-gba\" to indicate to the
application server (i.e. NAF) that the UE supports 3GPP-bootstrapping based
authentication.
**Date:** Represents the date and time at which the message was originated.
**Accept:** Media types which are acceptable for the response.
**Referer:** Allows the user agent to specify the address (URI) of the
resource from which the URI for the AS was obtained.
NOTE 1: The UE assumes it is communicating directly with the AS, but is in
fact communicating with the AP which functioning as a reverse proxy.
2\. **401 Unauthorized response (AP to UE) - see example in table D.3-2**
Upon receiving an HTTP request that contains static string \"3gpp-gba\" in the
User-Agent header, the AP might choose to authenticate the UE using
bootstrapped security association. If AP chooses to authenticate the UE using
bootstrapped security association, it responds with HTTP response code 401
\"Unauthorized\" which contains a WWW-Authenticate header. The header
instructs the UE to use HTTP Digest Authentication with a bootstrapped
security association.
Table **D.3** -2: 401 Unauthorized response (AP to UE)
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Server: Apache/1.3.22 (Unix) mod_perl/1.27

>
> The realm attribute contains two parts delimited by \"@\" sign. The first
> part is a constant string \"3GPP-bootstrapping\" instructing the UE to use a
> bootstrapped security association. The second part is the FQDN of the NAF.
> In this case, the FQDN of the NAF must be the server hostname that the UE
> used in the corresponding HTTP request, i.e., the hostname of the AS.
3\. **Generation of NAF specific keys at UE**
The UE verifies that the second part of the realm attribute does correspond to
the server it is talking to. In particular, if the conversation is taking
place inside a server-authenticated TLS tunnel, the UE verifies that the
server name in the server\'s TLS certificate matches the server name in the
realm attribute of the WWW-Authenticate header.
The UE derives the NAF specific key material Ks_(ext)_NAF as specified in 3GPP
TS 33.220 [1].
NOTE 2: If the UE does not have a bootstrapped security association available,
it will obtain one by running bootstrapping procedure over Ub interface
4\. **GET request (UE to AP) - see example in table D.3-3**
The UE generates the HTTP request by calculating the Authorization header
values using the bootstrapping transaction identifier **B-** TID it received
from the BSF as the username and the NAF specific key material Ks_(ext)_NAF
(base64 encoded) as the password, and sends the request to the AP.
Table **D.3** -3: GET request (UE to AP)
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: as1.home1.net:1234
User-Agent: NAF1 Application Agent; Release-6 3gpp-gba

Accept: */*

response=\"6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1\",
opaque=\"5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f30e41\", algorithm=MD5
**Authorization:** This carries the response to the authentication challenge
received in step 2 along with the username, the realm, the nonce, the URI, the
qop, the NC, the cnonce, the response, the opaque, and the algorithm.
**The qop attribute is set to \"auth-int\" when HTTP Digest integrity
protection is used. If the conversation is taking place inside a server-
authenticated TLS tunnel, the qop attribute can be set to \"auth\" as well.**
5\. **Validate authentication and authorize request**
If the AP does not have the NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF),
then the AP retrieves that and one or more user security setting (USS) from
the BSF. For detailed signalling flows see 3GPP TS 29.109 [3].
If the AP retrieved an application-specific USS and it contained a keyChoice
indication, the AP must enforce this indication. Hence, if the UICC-based key
was indicated the AP must terminate the communication with the UE in this
phase.
NOTE 3: If the local configuration in the AP restricts the access to this NAF
service to UICC-based applications, then the AP will terminate the
communication with the UE in this phase.
The AP verifies the Authorization header by using the bootstrapping
transaction identifier B-TID and the key material Ks_(ext)_NAF obtained from
BSF. The AP calculates the corresponding digest values using Ks_(ext)_NAF, and
compares the calculated values with the received values in the Authorization
header. The AP will also verify that the DNS name in the realm attribute
matches the AS hostname. If the conversation is taking place inside a server-
authenticated TLS tunnel, the AP will also verify that this DNS name is the
same as that of the TLS server.
If the verification succeeds, the incoming client-payload request is taken in
for further processing.
Depending on the AP configuration, the AP will inspect the incoming HTTP
request accordingly, see 3GPP TS 33.222 [5]. In this example it is assumed
that the AP has been configured to add subscriber\'s identifiers (UIDs) to the
forwarded HTTP request (see step 6).
NOTE 4: If UE has included \"X-3GPP-Intended-Identity\" with subscriber\'s
identity to the HTTP response, then the AP will validate the given identity
before forwarding the request to the AS.
6\. **GET request (AP to AS) - see example in table D.3-4**
The AP forwards the HTTP request to the correct AS. The correct AS is
determined by checking the \"Host\" header of the request and AP\'s internal
configuration.
The AP removes the \"Authorization\" header from the forwarded HTTP request.
Depending on the AP configuration, the AP might add subscriber\'s UIDs to the
HTTP request by using \"X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity\" header.
> In this example, subscriber\'s UIDs are added to the request.

7\. **AS specific logic at AS**
The AS processes the incoming HTTP request and extracts the UIDs from the
\"X-3GPP-Asserted-Identity\" header.
8\. **200 OK response (AS to AP) - see example in table D.3-5**
The AS returns a HTTP response to the AP with service specific payload.

9\. **Add Authentication-Info header at AP**
The AP calculates and adds the \"Authentication-Info\" header to the HTTP
response that forwarded to the UE.

###### ## Annex E (informative): Signalling flows for PKI portal
# E.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for the subscriber certificate
enrolment and the CA certificate delivery.
# E.2 Introduction
## E.2.1 General
A bootstrapping session established using a bootstrapping procedure (cf.,
clause 4 and annex A) is used between a UE and a PKI portal. The BSF provides
to the PKI portal a NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF) which is
derived from the key material (Ks). The PKI portal uses this key to
authenticate and optionally secure (i.e. integrity protect and encrypt) the
communications between it and the UE. The BSF will also provide the PKI portal
the expiration time of the bootstrapping session.
## E.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The key to interpret signalling flows is specified in subclause A.2.2.
# E.3 Signalling flows demonstrating a successful subscriber certificate
enrolment
## E.3.1 Simple subscriber certificate enrolment
The signalling flow in figure E.3.1-1 describes the message exchange between
UE and PKI portal when UE wants to enrol a subscriber certificate. The
messaging can take place inside a server-authenticated TLS (as described in
the RFC for TLS defined in annex E of 3GPP TS 33.310 [25]) tunnel in which
case TLS session has been established before step 1.
Figure E.3.1-1: Successful subscriber certificate enrolment.
1\. **Initial enrolment request (UE to PKI portal) - see example in table
E.3.1-1**
The UE sends an HTTP request to the PKI portal containing a PKCS#10
certification request.

NOTE 1: This step is used to trigger the GBA-based authentication between the
UE and the PKI portal.
2\. **401 Unauthorized response (PKI portal to UE) - see example in table
E.3.1-2**
Upon receiving an HTTP request that contains static string \"3gpp-gba\" in the
User-Agent header the PKI portal responds with HTTP response code 401
\"Unauthorized\" which contains a WWWâ€‘Authenticate header. The header
instructs the UE to use HTTP Digest Authentication with a bootstrapped
security association.

3\. **Generation of NAF specific keys at UE**
The UE verifies that the second part of the realm attribute does correspond to
the server it is talking to. In particular, if the messaging is taking place
inside a server-authenticated TLS tunnel, the UE verifies that the server name
(i.e. FQDN of the PKI portal) in the server\'s TLS certificate matches the
hostname of the server in the realm attribute of the WWW-Authenticate header.
UE derives the NAF specific key material Ks_NAF as specified in 3GPP TS 33.220
[1].
NOTE 2: If UE does not have a bootstrapped security association available, it
will obtain one by running bootstrapping procedure over Ub interface.
4\. **Authenticated enrolment request (UE to PKI portal) - see example in
table E.3.1-3**
UE generates the HTTP request by calculating the Authorization header values
using the bootstrapping transaction identifier **B-** TID it received from the
BSF as the username and the NAF specific key material Ks_NAF (base64 encoded)
as the password, and sends the request to PKI portal.

taking place inside a server-authenticated TLS tunnel, the qop attribute can
be set to \"auth\" as well.**
NOTE 3: If step 1 was a POST request then this request would also be POST
request and contain the same client payload in the HTTP request as was carried
in step 1.
5\. **Zn: NAF specific key procedure**
PKI portal retrieves the NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF) and subscriber\'s
user security setting from the BSF.
NOTE 4: Subscriber\'s user security setting for PKI portal consists of flags
that indicate whether certain type certificate is authorized to be issued to
the subscriber. There are two certificate types: authentication certificate
and non-repudiation certificate.
For detailed signalling flows see 3GPP TS 29.109 [3].
Table **E.3**.1-4: Bootstrapping authentication information procedure (PKI
portal to BSF)
* * *
Message source and destination Zn Information element name Information Source
in GET Description NAF to BSF B-TID Authorization The bootstrapping
transaction identifier (B-TID) is encoded in the username field according to
the Authorization protocol.
* * *
6\. **Authentication and certificate generation at PKI portal**
PKI portal verifies the Authorization header by using the bootstrapping
transaction identifier B-TID and the key material Ks_NAF obtained from BSF.
PKI portal calculates the corresponding digest values using Ks_NAF, and
compares the calculated values with the received values in the Authorization
header.
The PKI portal also verifies that the hostname (i.e. its FQDN) in the realm
attribute matches its own. If the messaging is taking place inside a server-
authenticated TLS tunnel, the PKI portal also verifies that this hostname is
the same as that of the TLS server.
If the verification succeeds, the incoming client-payload request is taken in
for further processing. The PKI portal continues processing of the PKCS#10
request according to its internal policies. The PKI portal verifies that the
subscriber is allowed to receive the particular type of certificate indicate
in the PKCS#10 request by checking subscriber\'s user security setting
received from the BSF in step 5.
NOTE 5: The procedures for generating the subscriber certificate are outside
the scope.
7\. **Delivery of subscriber certificate (PKI portal to UE) - see example in
table E.3.1-5**
The PKI portal sends 200 OK response to the UE to indicate the success of the
authentication and the subscriber certificate enrolment. The PKI portal
generates a HTTP response containing the enrolled subscriber certificate. The
PKI portal can use key material Ks_NAF to integrity protect and authenticate
the response.

8\. **Authentication at UE**
The UE receives the response and verifies the Authentication-Info header. If
the verification succeeds, the UE can accept the subscriber certificate for
further processing.
## E.3.2 Subscriber certificate enrolment with WIM authentication codes
The signalling flow in figure E.3.2-1 describes the message exchange between
UE and PKI portal when UE wants to enrol a subscriber certificate, and the UE
uses a WIM that requires authentication codes both for onboard key pair
generation and proof-of-origin generation. The messaging can take place inside
a server-authenticated TLS (as described in the RFC for TLS defined in annex E
of 3GPP TS 33.310 [25]) tunnel in which case TLS session has been established
before step 1.
Figure E.3.2-1: Successful subscriber certificate enrolment
1\. **WIM authentication code for onboard key pair generation required at UE**
The UE has initiated enrolment procedure and the WIM in the UE requires an WIM
authentication code for the onboard key pair generation.
NOTE 1: It is not mandatory to generate a key pair for each enrolment
procedure, and the WIM can not require WIM authentication code for generating
the key pair. In these cases, the WIM authentication code is not needed.
2\. **Initial WIM authentication code request (UE to PKI portal) - see example
in table E.3.2-1**
The UE sends an HTTP request to the PKI portal containing a WIM authentication

# E.4 Signalling flows demonstrating a failure in subscriber certificate
enrolment
The signalling flow in figure E.3.1-1 describes the message exchange between
UE and PKI portal using HTTP Digest Authentication. This clause describes a
failure in the subscriber certificate enrolment, related to PKI procedures.
Thus, it assumed that subscriber certificate enrolment procedure has proceeded
to step 6 as described in subclause E.3.1.
6\. **Authentication and certificate generation at PKI portal**
The verification procedures described in subclause E.3.1 step 6 are
successfully completed.
The PKI portal encounters an error during the internal enrolment procedure.
For example, the PKI portal is not allowed to issue a certificate to the
subscriber due operator\'s internal policies, i.e. the subscriber\'s profile
in the HSS indicates that the enrolment is not allowed.
7\. **Error notification** **(PKI portal to UE) - see example in table E.4-1**
The PKI portal sends 403 Forbidden response to the UE to indicate that the

The UE receives the response and verifies the Authentication-Info header. If
the verification succeeds, the UE can accept the CA certificate for further
processing.
# E.6 Signalling flows demonstrating a failure in CA certificate delivery
The signalling flow in figure E.5-1 describes the message exchange between UE
and PKI portal when UE requests a CA certificate delivery. This clause
describes a failure in the CA certificate delivery. It assumed that CA
certificate delivery procedure has proceeded to step 6 as described in clause
E.5.

###### ## Annex F (informative): Signalling flows for PSK TLS with
bootstrapped security association
# F.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for using PSK TLS with
bootstrapped security association.
# F.2 Introduction
## F.2.1 General
A bootstrapping session established using a bootstrapping procedure (cf.,
clause 4 and annex A) is used between a UE and a NAF. The BSF provides to the
NAF a NAF specific key material (Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF and optionally
Ks_int_NAF) which is derived from the key material (Ks). The NAF uses this key
to authenticate and optionally secure (i.e. integrity protect and encrypt) the
communications between it and the UE. The BSF will also provide the NAF the
expiration time of the bootstrapping session. When the bootstrapping session
becomes invalid the NAF will stop using the session, and indicate to the UE
that bootstrapping session has expired and that new session needs to be
established.
An example of the signalling flows of the authentication procedure using PSK
TLS is given in clause F.3.
## F.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The following key (rules) have been applied to TLS handshake signalling flows
to improve readability, reduce errors and increase maintainability:
a) The description of TLS messages and their fields are identified by three
fields: \"TLS.MESSAGE.FIELD\":
\- \"TLS\" identifies that the message is a TLS message;
\- \"MESSAGE\" identifies the name of the TLS message (e.g. ClientHello);
\- \"FIELD\" identifies the name of the TLS message field (e.g.
client_version).
> An example being \"TLS.ClientHello.client_version\", which identifies TLS
> message \"ClientHello\" and its data field \"client_version\". The possible
> TLS message and TLS message field names as well as their encoding to the TLS
> protocol are specified in IETF TLS related specifications as defined in
> annex E of 3GPP TS 33.310 [25].
b) If multiple TLS messages are sent in sequence from one entity to another
this is described as one step.
\- the figures describe the sending of multiple TLS messages in one step by
listing the TLS message names in separate lines;
\- the description of the step contains the explanation of the messages and
their parameters as described in bullet a).
c) In order to differentiate between TLS messages and other protocol messages,
the TLS messages are marked with simple arrow line, and all _non-TLS_ messages
with block arrows.
d) The flows show the signalling exchanges between the following functional
entities:
\- User Equipment (UE);
\- Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF);
\- Network Application Function (NAF).
# F.3 Signalling flow demonstrating a successful PSK TLS authentication
procedure
The signalling flow in figure F.3-1 describes the generic message exchange
between UE and NAF using PSK TLS. In this example, the PSK TLS client
application resides in the ME, i.e., either Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF is used as
the key.
Figure F.3-1: PSK TLS handshake with bootstrapped security association.
1\. **TLS handshake message: ClientHello (UE to NAF)**
The UE sends ClientHello message to the NAF. In order to indicate that the UE
is capable of PSK-based authentication it includes the PSK-based ciphersuites
to the list of acceptable ciphersuites list. The UE also includes to the
ClientHello message the server_name TLS extension containing the hostname of
the NAF.
> **TLS.ClientHello.client_version:** the version of the TLS protocol in the
> UE is 3.1.
>
> **TLS.ClientHello.random:** a UE generated random structure.
>
> **TLS.ClientHello.session_id:** the ID of the TLS session is empty, i.e. no
> previous TLS session is used.
>
> **TLS.ClientHello.cipher_suites:** the list of ciphersuites includes one or
> more PSK-based ciphersuites.
>
> **TLS.ClientHello.compression_methods:** a list of the compression methods
> is null.
>
> **TLS.ClientHello.client_hello_extension_list:** list of extensions includes
> server_name extension that contains the hostname of the NAF.
2\. **TLS handshake messages: ServerHello, ServerKeyExchange, ServerHelloDone
(NAF to UE)**
If the NAF wants to use PSK-based authentication, it selects one of the
acceptable PSK-based ciphersuites, places the selected ciphersuite in the
ServerHello message, and includes an appropriate ServerKeyExchange message.
The NAF can help the UE in selecting the correct PSK identity by providing a
list of hints in ServerKeyExchange message. That list includes a static string
\"3GPPâ€‘bootstrapping \".
**TLS.ServerHello.server_version:** the version of the TLS protocol in the NAF
is 3.1.
> **TLS.ServerHello.random:** a NAF generated random (must be different from
> ClientHello.random).
>
> **TLS.ServerHello.session_id:** the identity of the TLS session generated by
> the NAF.
>
> **TLS.ServerHello.cipher_suite:** the ciphersuite selected by the NAF is one
> of the PSK-based ciphersuites listed in ClientHello.cipher_suites.
>
> **TLS.ServerHello.compression_method:** the compression method selected by
> the NAF is null.
>
> **TLS.ServerHello.server_hello_extension_list:** list of extensions is
> empty.
>
> **TLS.ServerKeyExchange.psk_identity_hint:** the PSK identity hint contains
> the constant string \"3GPP-bootstrapping\".
>
> **TLS.ServerHelloDone:** this message does not have data fields.
3\. **Bootstrapping and generation of NAF specific key material at UE**
The UE performs the bootstrapping procedure to produce B-TID and Ks_(ext)_NAF
as described in clause A.3. If bootstrapping procedure has been done recently,
the UE can use the B-TID and Ks_(ext)_NAF produced from that procedure.
4\. **TLS handshake messages: ClientKeyExchange, ChangeCipherSpec, Finished
(UE to NAF)**
The UE sets concatenated \"3GPP-bootstrapping\" string, separator character
\";\" and the B-TID as the PSK identity, and Ks_(ext)_NAF as the pre-shared
key. The UE then sends ClientKeyExchange containing the B-TID,
ChangeCipherSpec, and Finished messages to the NAF. The TLS premaster secret
is derived from Ks_(ext)_NAF.
> **TLS.ClientKeyExchange.psk_identity:** the PSK identity contains
> concatenated \"3GPP-bootstrapping\" string, separator character \";\" and
> the B-TID.
>
> **TLS.ChangeCipherSpec.type:** contains value 1 (change_cipher_spec).
>
> **TLS.Finished.verify_data:** the verify data contains the hash of the
> handshake messages. For details, see the RFC for TLS defined in annex E of
> 3GPP TS 33.310 [25].
5\. **Zn: NAF specific key procedure**
The NAF extracts the B-TID from the ClientKeyExchange message and requests the
NAF specific key (Ks_NAF or Ks_ext_NAF) from BSF. The BSF returns the NAF
specific key that corresponds to the B-TID.
If the NAF retrieved an application-specific USS and it contained a keyChoice
indication, the NAF must enforce this indication. Hence, if the UICC-based key
was indicated the NAF must terminate the communication with the UE in this
phase.
NOTE: If the local configuration in the NAF restricts the access to this NAF
service to UICC-based applications, then the NAF will terminate the
communication with the UE in this phase.
For detailed signalling flows see 3GPP TS 29.109 [3].

###### ## Annex H (normative): 2G GBA
## H.1 Introduction
This annex specifies the implementation option to allow the use of SIM cards
or SIMs on UICC for GBA. The procedure specified in this annex is called 2G
GBA. 2G GBA allows access to applications in a more secure way that would be
possible with the use of password or with GSM without enhancements. Stage 2
level details for 2G GBA has been specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1], Annex I.
## H.2 2G GBA bootstrapping procedure
A UE and the BSF shall establish a bootstrapped security association between
them by running the 2G GBA bootstrapping procedure. The bootstrapping security
association consists of a bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) and key
material Ks. Bootstrapping session on the BSF also includes security related
information about subscriber (e.g. user\'s private identity). Bootstrapping
session is valid for a certain time period, and shall be deleted in the BSF
when the session becomes invalid.
It shall be possible that the BSF is configured to either allow or disallow
the use of 2G GBA bootstrapping. If 2G GBA is disallowed, the BSF shall not
start the TLS handshake with the UE as described below.
The 2G GBA Bootstrapping procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1] is
further detailed as described below.
\- Authorization, WWW-Authenticate, and Authentication-Info HTTP headers shall
be used as described in RFC 3310 [6] with following exceptions:
a) the \"realm\" parameter shall contain the FQDN of the BSF. The UE shall
check that the \"realm\" attribute contains the same FQDN of the BSF that was
present in the BSF certificate.
b) the quality of protection (\"qop\") parameter shall be \"auth-int\".
c) the \"username\" parameter shall contain user\'s private identity (IMPI)
which has been derived from the IMSI of the SIM application as specified in
3GPP TS 23.003 [7].
d) the \"nonce\" field shall be populated as specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1],
Annex H with
\- the \"RAND\" which is the RAND of the 2G authentication vector, and
\- the \"AUTN\" which is a 128-bit zero number, and
\- the \"server specific\" data is a 128-bit random number \"Ks-input\"
generated by the BSF.
\- the \"RES\" which is used as the password is derived as specified in 3GPP
TS 33.220 [1], Annex H.
In addition to RFC 3310 [6], the following apply:
a) In the initial request from the UE to the BSF, the UE shall include
Authorization header with following parameters:
\- the username directive, set to the value of the private user identity IMPI
derived from the IMSI of the SIM according to 3GPP TS 23.003 [7];
\- the realm directive, set to the BSF address derived from the IMSI of the
SIM according to 3GPP TS 23.003 [7];
\- the uri directive, set to either absoluteURL \"https://\/\" or
abs_path \"/\", and which one is used is specified in RFC 2617 [9];
\- the nonce directive, set to an empty value; and
\- the response directive, set to an empty value;
b) In the challenge response from the BSF to the UE, the BSF shall include
parameters to WWW-Authenticate header as specified in RFC 3310 [6] with
following clarifications:
\- the realm directive, set to the BSF address derived from the IMSI of the
SIM according to 3GPP TS 23.003 [7];
c) In the message from the BSF to the UE, the BSF shall include bootstrapping
transaction identifier (B-TID) and the key lifetime to an XML document in the
HTTP response payload. The BSF may also include additional server specific
data to the XML document. The XML schema definition of this XML document is
given in Annex C.
d) Authentication-Info header shall be included into the subsequent HTTP
response after the BSF concluded that the UE has been authenticated.
Authentication-Info header shall include the \"rspauth\" parameter.
After successful bootstrapping procedure the UE and the BSF shall contain the
key material (Ks) and the B-TID. The key material shall be derived from AKA
parameters as specified for 2G GBA in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1]. In addition, BSF
shall also contain a set of security specific attributes (GUSS) related to the
UE.
## H.3 User authentication failure
If the response returned by the UE is different than expected, the BSF may
challenge the UE again with a new AKA challenge using a new 2G authentication
vector. After N consecutive incorrect responses from the UE, the BSF shall
indicate a failure to the UE. The exact value of N is defined by local policy.
## H.4 Network authentication failure
In case the UE fails at authenticating the network, the UE shall abort the
bootstrapping procedure.
###### ## Annex I (normative): GBA_Digest
## I.1 Introduction
This annex specifies the implementation option to use SIP Digest credentials
for GBA. The procedure specified in this annex is called GBA_Digest.
GBA_Digest allows access to applications in a more secure way that would be
possible with the use of password based HTTP Digest. Stage 2 level description
for GBA_Digest has been specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1], annex M.
## I.2 GBA_Digest bootstrapping procedure
A UE and the BSF shall establish a bootstrapped security association between
them by running the GBA_Digest bootstrapping procedure. The bootstrapping
security association consists of a bootstrapping transaction identifier
(B-TID) and key material Ks. A Bootstrapping session on the BSF also includes
security related information about the subscriber (in particular the user\'s
private identity). A Bootstrapping session is valid for a certain time period,
and shall be deleted in the BSF when the session becomes invalid.
The UE shall establish a TLS connection with the BSF prior to sending any HTTP
request to the BSF.
A UE shall indicate to the BSF that it intends to run GBA_Digest as defined in
3GPP TS 33.220 [1] by including a \"product\" token in the \"User-Agent\"
header field (cf. RFC 2616 [14]) that is set to a static string \"GBA_Digest\"
in HTTP requests sent to the BSF. The BSF is configured to either allow or
disallow the use of GBA_Digest bootstrapping. If GBA_Digest is disallowed, the
BSF shall reject the HTTP request by the UE.
The GBA_Digest Bootstrapping procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1] is
further detailed as described below.
\- Authorization, WWW-Authenticate, and Authentication-Info HTTP header fields
shall be used as described in RFC 2617 [9] with following exceptions:
a) the \"realm\" parameter shall be set to the domain name of the home
network;
b) the quality of protection (\"qop\") parameter shall be \"auth-int\";
c) the \"username\" parameter shall contain user\'s private identity;
d) the \"nonce\" field shall be populated as specified in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1],
annex M with a random number generated by the BSF according to RFC 2617 [9];
and
\- a password, which is called \"passwd\" and is derived as specified in 3GPP
TS 33.220 [1], annex M.
In addition to RFC 2617 [9], the following apply:
a) in the initial request from the UE to the BSF, the UE shall include an
Authorization header field with following parameters:
the uri directive, set to either absoluteURL \"https://\/\" or
abs_path \"/\", and which one is used is specified in RFC 2617 [9];
\- the nonce directive, set to an empty value;
\- the response directive, set to an empty value;
b) in the HTTP response containing the Digest challenge from the BSF to the
UE, the BSF shall include parameters to WWW-Authenticate header field as
specified in RFC 2617 [9];
c) in the HTTP request sent as an answer to the HTTP response in bullet b) the
UE shall include an Authorization header field that contains a digest-
response, \"cnonce\", and \"nonce-count\" header field parameters as specified
in RFC 2617 [9], and
\- the uri directive, set to either absoluteURL \"https://\/\" or
abs_path \"/\", and which one is used is specified in RFC 2617 [9];
\- the nonce directive, set to an empty value; and
d) n the message from the BSF to the UE, which the BSF shall only send after
the BSF concluded that the UE has been authenticated, the BSF shall include an
Authentication-Info header with the \"rspauth\" parameter. Furthermore, the
BSF shall include the bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) and the key
lifetime to an XML document in the HTTP response payload. The BSF may also
include additional server specific data to the XML document. The XML schema
definition of this XML document is given in Annex C.
After a successful bootstrapping procedure the UE and the BSF shall contain
the key material (Ks) and the B-TID. The key material shall be derived from
SIP Digest parameters as specified for GBA_Digest in 3GPP TS 33.220 [1]. In
addition, the BSF may also contain a set of security specific attributes
(GUSS) related to the UE, depending on the conditions in subclause 4.5.2 of
3GPP TS 33.220 [1].
## I.3 User authentication failure
If the response returned by the UE is different than expected, the BSF may
challenge the UE again with a new Digest challenge using the same SIP Digest
authentication vector. After N consecutive incorrect responses from the UE,
the BSF shall indicate a failure to the UE. The exact value of N is defined by
local policy.
## I.4 Network authentication failure
In case the UE fails at authenticating the network, the UE shall abort the
bootstrapping procedure.
###### ## Annex J (Normative): Realization of GBA Push delivery
# J.1 Introduction
The GBA Push procedure is executed in order to establish a bootstrapped
security association, i.e. bootstrapping session between a Push-NAF and a UE.
The GBA Push service is initiated by delivering GBA Push Information (GPI) to
the UE as described in 3GPP TS 33.223 [24]. However, 3GPP TS 33.223 [24] only
specifies the GBA Push architecture; this annex specifies how GPI is delivered
to the UE using WAP Push without the OMA DM Notification structure.
# J.2 GPI delivery using WAP Push
## J.2.1 General
When the GPI data object is delivered using SMS, the Push-NAF and the UE shall
use the **Push OTA protocol over WSP** as defined in OMA\'s \"Push Over the
Air\" specification **[26] for** connectionless non-secure push.
## J.2.2 Push-NAF procedures
In order to send the GPI via WSP, the Push-NAF shall construct a push message
according to OMA\'s \"Push Message Specification\" [27] and shall populate the
push message as follows:
\- the Content-Type header shall include the MIME media type
'application/vnd.3gpp.gba.gpi' or the corresponding short code as defined in
subclause J.3.1.3.
\- the X-WAP-Application-ID header shall include the application-id associated
with the specific GBA User Agent or the corresponding short code, if available
for the application in question. The short code for the identifier of a
specific application is defined in the corresponding specification for the
application.
\- the Session Identifier shall be different between different GBA Push
initiated sessions for the same recipient. All messages in the associated OMA
DM session shall include the Session identifier as Session ID.
\- the message body shall contain the GPI envelope as described in subclause
J.3.1.2 with the version field set to 1, the session identifier set by the
server, as specified in sublause J.3.1.2, and GPI field set to the GPI.
NOTE 1: One SMS can carry 140 bytes of information and the GPI message fits
into a single SMS when short codes are used for the Content-Type and X-WAP-
Application-ID attributes, as described in subclause J.3. When short codes are
not defined, or not used, the WAP Push message does not fit into a single SMS
message and then concatenated SMS messages are used.
The general format of the GPI push message within one SMS message is shown as
an example in table J.2-1.

This is 2 | | | | bytes for OMA DM | | | | Notifications. | | | +-------------------------+----------------+-------------------------+
NOTE 2: If the GPI Push message needs to be sent in more than one SMS, the
segmentation information is added in 5 bytes to the WDP headers in each SMS
(in total 7+5=12 bytes). The 5 added bytes are Type 0x00, len 0x03, Message
Reference Number (byte) for concatenation, Current Segment Number (byte) and
Total Segment Count (byte).
## J.2.3 UE procedures
### J.2.3.1 Reception of GPI in push message
Upon receiving a push message on the IANA registered WDP port 2948 according
to OMA\'s \"Push Message Specification\" [27] where:
\- the Content-Type header indicates the application/vnd.3gpp.gba.gpi MIME
type as defined in subclause J.3.1.4 or the the corresponding short code as
defined in sublause J.3.1.3; and
\- the X-WAP-Application-ID header indicates an application supported by the
UE;
the UE shall extract GPI from the GPI envelope according to subclause J.3.1,
check the integrity of the GPI and use the Application-ID to locate the
corresponding application in the UE. The UE uses the content of the push
message to establish a connection with the indicated server. All messages in
the associated OMA DM session shall include the Session identifier (Session
ID) as received from Push-NAF.
NOTE: As indicated in OMA DM Enabler Release v1.2 [28] it is also possible to
send WAP Push messages using some other transport than SMS, if the UE for
example does not support SMS. OMA\'s \"Push Message Specification\" [27] also
specifies OTA-HTTP and OTA-SIP, which can be supported by the UE.
# J.3 PDUs and parameters specific to the present document
## J.3.1 GPI envelope
### J.3.1.1 General
This subclause defines the GPI envelope carrying GPI as specified for the GAA
bootstrap framework in 3GPP TS 33.223 [24].
### J.3.1.2 Structure
The GPI envelope is coded according to figure J.3.1.2-1 and table J.3.1.2-1.
+--------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | | +--------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Version | octet 1 | | | | | | | | +--------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Session identifier | octet 2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | octet 3 | | | | | | | | +--------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | GPI | octet 4 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | octet n | | | | | | | | +--------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

The version field is in the octet 1. Version field value equal to 1 indicates
that the structure is according to this document. Sending entity does not set
the version field to a value not defined by this document. Receiving entity
ignores any GPI envelope with version field set to unknown value. The session
identifier field is in the octet 2 and the octet 3. The Session identifier
field defines the identifier of the corresponding OMA DM session to be
established due to the GBA Push message. The format and content definitions of
the Session identifier field shall be the same as for the Session ID component
in the OMA DM SYNCML header as specified in OMA Device Management Enabler
Release v1.2, see [28]. The GPI field is in octets starting from octet 4 til
the end of the GPI envelope.
