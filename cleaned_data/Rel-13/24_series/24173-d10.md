# 4 Overview of multimedia telephony communication service and associated
supplementary services in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem
## 4.1 General
In accordance with the service definition and requirements in 3GPP TS 22.173
[2], the IMS multimedia telephony communication service specified herein
allows multimedia conversational communication between two or more end points.
An end point is typically located in a UE, but can also be located in a
network entity.
As for traditional circuit-switched telephony, the protocols for the IMS
multimedia Telephony communication service allow a user to connect to any
other user, regardless of operator and access technology.
The IMS multimedia Telephony communication service consists of two principal
parts: a basic communication part, and an optional supplementary services
part.
## 4.1A Roles
### 4.1A.1 Multimedia telephony participant
A UE shall implement the role of a multimedia telephony participant.
### 4.1A.2 Multimedia telephony application server
An application server shall implement the role of a multimedia telephony
application server. Various application server usages are called out by
references to the various supplementary services, see subclause 4.3. It is an
implementation decision on how to allocate the functionality to one or more
application servers.
## 4.2 Overview of basic communication part
The basic communication part of an IMS multimedia telephony communication
service session is realised by a single SIP session. It utilises media
capabilities and flexibility provided by the SIP protocol and the 3GPP IMS
specifications. In accordance with the service definition in 3GPP TS 22.173
[2], media capabilities include RTP-based transfer of voice, real-time video,
real-time text and data, and UDPTL-based transfer of fax (IETF RFC 3362 [28]),
as well as TCP/MSRP-based transfer of text, arbitrary files and sharing of
media files with predefined formats.
To ensure interoperability, media handling (including codecs and formats) is
fully specified for RTP-based and MSRP-based transfer in:
\- 3GPP TS 26.114 [12] for 3GPP systems;
\- 3GPP2 C.S0055-A [21] for 3GPP2 systems; and
\- ETSI TS 181 005 [22] (codecs) and 3GPP TS 26.114 [12] (formats and other
media handling) for fixed-broadband accesses.
The service is highly dynamic in terms of media component usage: the protocols
allow a communication session to start with one or more media components, and
components can then be added and/or removed during the communication session.
The protocols allow both one-way and two ways transfer between end points.
Full duplex speech, and speech combined with other media components, are
typical media cases but the protocols do not mandate the use of speech in all
sessions.
## 4.3 Overview of supplementary services part
The supplementary services part of the IMS multimedia telephony communication
service consists of a number of specified supplementary services. These are
fully standardized to ensure interoperability between multiple end points, and
between end points and network control entities. The behaviour of
supplementary services is similar to supplementary services specified for CS
speech (TS 11). Supplementary services uses SIP as enabling protocol.
Configuration of supplementary services by the user should:
\- take place over the Ut interface using XCAP as enabling protocol as
described in 3GPP TS 24.623 [11]; or
\- use SIP based user configuration as described in 3GPP TS 24.238 [20] ;
NOTE: Other possibilities for user configuration, such as web-based
provisioning or pre-provisioning by the operator are outside the scope of the
present document, but are not precluded.
The \"SS_domain_setting\" leaf in 3GPP TS 24.167 [32] provides a mechanism to:
a) instruct the UE to only use the PS domain for SS setting control;
b) instruct the UE to only use the CS domain for SS setting control; or
c) instruct the UE to use the PS domain for SS setting control when the PS
domain is being used by the UE for voice services, and to use the CS domain
for SS setting control when the CS domain is being used by the UE for voice
services.
If one of the restrictions described in the bullets a) or c) applies, then the
\"PS_domain_IMS_SS_control_preference\" leaf in 3GPP TS 24.167 [32] provides a
mechanism to:
\- restrict the UE to use the Ut interface with XCAP as enabling protocol as
described in 3GPP TS 24.623 [11]; or
\- restrict the UE to use SIP based user configuration as described in 3GPP TS
24.238 [20].
# 5 Basic Communication
## 5.1 IMS communication service identifier
URN used to define the ICSI for the IMS Multimedia Telephony Communication
Service: urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel. The URN is registered at
http://www.3gpp.com/Uniform-Resource-Name-URN-list.html.
Summary of the URN: This URN indicates that the device supports the IMS
Multimedia Telephony Communication Service.
The URN is intended primarily for use in the following applications,
protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:
This URN is most useful in a communications application, for describing the
capabilities of a device, such as a phone or PDA.
Examples of typical use: Indicating that a mobile phone can support the IMS
Multimedia Telephony Communication Service.

> Supplementary Services, stage 3\"
## 5.2 Session control procedures
The IMS multimedia telephony communication service can support different types
of media, including media types listed in 3GPP TS 22.173 [2]. The session
control procedures for the different media types shall be in accordance with
3GPP TS 24.229 [13] and 3GPP TS 24.247 [14], with the following additions:
a) Multimedia telephony is an IMS communication service and the P-Preferred-
Service and P-Asserted-Service headers shall be treated as described in 3GPP
TS 24.229 [13]. The coding of the ICSI value in the P-Preferred-Service and
P-Asserted-Service headers shall be according to subclause 5.1.
b) The multimedia telephony participant shall include the \"+g.3gpp. icsi-
ref\" header field parameter equal to the ICSI value defined in subclause 5.1
in the Contact header field in initial requests and responses as described in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13].
c) The multimedia telephony participant shall include an Accept-Contact header
field containing the \"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header field parameter containing
the ICSI value defined in subclause 5.1 in initial requests. If the user
requests capabilities other than multimedia telephony, the Accept-Contact
header field may contain other feature parameters and feature parameter
values, and other Accept-Contact header fields may be added to express user
preferences as per IETF RFC 3841 [16].
NOTE 1: How the user indicates other feature parameters and the feature
parameter values is outside of the scope of this document.
d) The multimedia telephony application server shall include the
\"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header field parameter equal to the ICSI value defined in
subclause 5.1 in a Feature-Caps header field in requests sent to the
terminating user and in 1xx or 2xx responses to requests from the originating
user as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13] and IETF RFC 6809 [31].
e) The multimedia telephony participant may use the presence of a
\"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header field parameter equal to the ICSI value defined in
subclause 5.1 in a Feature-Caps header field in requests and responses as
described in IETF RFC 6809 [31] to determine that a multimedia telephony
application server is participating in the session and multimedia telephony is
the IMS communication service supported for use in the dialog.
NOTE 2: ICSI values with subclass identifiers are considered equal to the
value defined in subclause 5.1 when determining that the multimedia telephony
application server is participating in the session.
## 5.3 Interworking
The multimedia telephony participant could receive initial requests that do
not contain the ICSI value defined in subclause 5.1 in the Accept-Contact
header but still invoke the IMS multimedia telephony communication service
application.

## J.2.1 Procedures at the UE
### J.2.1.1 Service Specific Access Control
The following information is provided by lower layer:
\- BarringFactorForMMTEL-Voice: barring rate for MMTEL voice;
\- BarringTimeForMMTEL-Voice: barring timer for MMTEL voice;
\- BarringFactorForMMTEL-Video: barring rate for MMTEL video; and
\- BarringTimeForMMTEL-Video: barring timer for MMTEL video.
Upon request from a user to establish a multimedia telephony communication
session as described in subclause 5.2, the UE shall:
1) if the multimedia telephony communication session to be established is an
emergency session, then skip the rest of steps below and continue with session
establishment as described in subclause 5.2;
2) retrieve SSAC related information mentioned above from lower layers;
NOTE 1: The values of SSAC related information retrieved from lower layers can
depend on whether the UE has an Access Class with a value in the range 11..15
or not. Determination of the values of the SSAC related information is
described in subclause 5.3.3.10 of 3GPP TS 36.331 [26].
3) if video is offered in the multimedia telephony communication session:
A) if back-off timer Tx is running, reject the multimedia telephony
communication session establishment and skip the rest of steps below; or
B) else, then:
I) draw a new random number \"rand1\" that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ rand1 \< 1; and
II) if the random number \"rand1\" is lower than BarringFactorForMMTEL-Video,
then skip the rest of steps below and continue with session establishment as
described in subclause 5.2;
NOTE 2: If the BarringFactorForMMTEL-Video is set to 1, the session is
exempted from barring.
III) else, then;
i) draw a new random number \"rand2\" that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ rand2 \< 1; and
ii) start back-off timer Tx with the timer value calculated using the formula:
Tx = (0,7 + 0,6*rand2) * BarringTimeForMMTEL-Video; and
iii) reject the multimedia telephony communication session establishment and
skip the rest of steps below;
4) if audio is offered in the multimedia telephony communication session:
A) if back-off timer Ty is running, reject the multimedia telephony
communication session establishment and skip the rest of steps below; or
B) else, then;
I) draw a new random number \"rand3\" that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ rand3 \< 1; and
II) if the random number \"rand3\" is lower than BarringFactorForMMTEL-Voice,
then skip the rest of steps below and continue with session establishment as
described in subclause 5.2;
NOTE 3: If the BarringFactorForMMTEL-Voice is set to 1, the session is
exempted from barring.
III) else, then;
i) draw a new random number \"rand4\" that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ rand4 \< 1; and
ii) start timer Ty with the timer value calculated using the fomula:
Ty = (0,7 + 0,6*rand4) * BarringTimeForMMTEL-Voice; and
iii) reject the multimedia telephony communication session establishment;
NOTE 4: If the multimedia telephony communication implemenation and the access
stratum protocol implementation are located in separate physical entities, it
is expected that the interconnecting protocol supports the transfer of
information elements needed for the service specific access control
enforcement.
Service Specific Access Control is not activated when the UE is in other radio
accesses (e.g. UTRAN/GERAN). And when UE camping on E-UTRAN moves to other
radio accesses (e.g. UTRAN/GERAN), back-off timer (Tx or Ty or both) shall be
stopped if running.
### J.2.1.2 Smart Congestion Mitigation
The following information is provided to the non-access stratum:
\- MO-MMTEL-voice-started;
\- MO-MMTEL-voice-ended.
\- MO-MMTEL-video-started; and
\- MO-MMTEL-video-ended;
Upon request from a user to establish an originating multimedia telephony
communication session as described in subclause 5.2, and if the session
establishment is continued after performing the Service Specific Access
Control as specified in subclause J.2.1.1:
1) if only audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time text
(see subclause 4.2 for 3GPP systems) are offered in the multimedia telephony
communication session, and no other originating multimedia telephony
communication session initiated with offering only audio or only real-time
text or only both audio and real-time textexists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-
voice-started indication to the non-access stratum and continue with session
establishment as described in subclause 5.2;
2) if video is offered in the multimedia telephony communication session, and
no other originating multimedia telephony communication session initiated with
offering video exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-video-started indication to
the non-access stratum and continue with session establishment as described in
subclause 5.2.
When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends (i.e. a
response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE request is
transferred), the originating multimedia telephony communication session was
initiated with offering only audio or only real-time text or only both audio
and real-time text (i.e. in the SDP offer in the initial INVITE request), and
no other originating multimedia telephony communication session initiated with
offering only audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time
text exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-voice-ended to the non-access stratum.
When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends (i.e. a
response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE request is
transferred), the originating multimedia telephony communication session was
initiated with offering video (i.e. in the SDP offer in the initial INVITE
request), and no other originating multimedia telephony communication session
initiated with offering video exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-video-ended
indication to the non-access stratum.
NOTE 1: If the UE supports other 3GPP specific mechanisms for communicating
with the non-access stratum protocol implementation, e.g. DHCP discovery via
PCO, then the UE is expected to support the transfer of information elements
needed for the smart congestion mitigation enforcement.
NOTE 2: Adding or removing media during the multimedia telephony communication
session has no impact on the information relating to smart congestion
mitigation.

\- MO-MMTEL-video-started; and
\- MO-MMTEL-video-ended;
Upon request from a user to establish an originating multimedia telephony
communication session as described in subclause 5.2:
1) if only audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time text
(see subclause 4.2 for 3GPP systems) are offered in the multimedia telephony
communication session, and no other originating multimedia telephony
communication session initiated with offering only audio or only real-time
text or only both audio and real-time textexists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-
voice-started indication to the non-access stratum and continue with session
establishment as described in subclause 5.2;
2) if video is offered in the multimedia telephony communication session, and
no other originating multimedia telephony communication session initiated with
offering video exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-video-started indication to
the non-access stratum and continue with session establishment as described in
subclause 5.2.
When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends (i.e. a
response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE request is
transferred), the originating multimedia telephony communication session was
initiated with offering only audio or only real-time text or only both audio
and real-time text (i.e. in the SDP offer in the initial INVITE request), and
no other originating multimedia telephony communication session initiated with
offering only audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time
text exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-voice-ended to the non-access stratum.
When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends (i.e. a
response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE request is
transferred), the originating multimedia telephony communication session was
initiated with offering video (i.e. in the SDP offer in the initial INVITE
request), and no other originating multimedia telephony communication session
initiated with offering video exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-video-ended
indication to the non-access stratum.
NOTE 1: If the UE supports other 3GPP specific mechanisms for communicating
with the non-access stratum protocol implementation, e.g. DHCP discovery via
PCO, then the UE is expected to support the transfer of information elements
needed for the application specific congestion control for data communication
enforcement.
NOTE 2: Adding or removing media during the multimedia telephony communication
session has no impact on the information relating to application specific
congestion control for data communication.
