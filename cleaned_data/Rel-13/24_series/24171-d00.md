# 4 General
## 4.1 Overview
### 4.1.1 NAS aspect
To enable transfer of application protocol messages between the MME and the
UE, a generic \"container\" message is defined on the downlink (Downlink
Generic NAS Transport message) and the uplink (Uplink Generic NAS Transport
message). The message protocol and procedures are described in 3GPP TS 24.301
[3].
### 4.1.2 LCS aspect
Location Services (LCS) uses the generic containers provided by the NAS
Generic Transport mechanism to transfer LCS signalling messages between the UE
and the network.
Currently, container in the generic transport messages can carry the following
LCS information:
  * LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) messages (Refer to 3GPP TS 36.355 [4])
    * Both downlink and uplink LPP messages are supported
    * A Routing Identifier is transported as the Additional Information IE in Uplink/Downlink Generic NAS Transport message for LPP messages (Refer to 3GPP TS 24.301 [3])
```{=html}
``` \- Location services messages
    -   Messages for MO-LR operations (Refer to 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\])
    -   Messages for MT-LR LCS location notification (Refer to 3GPP TS
        24.080 \[5\])
## 4.2 LCS Support capabilities
### 4.2.1 UE support of LCS
The UE announces to the network its ability to support LCS notification
mechanism and/or LPP messages using the UE Network Capability IE defined in
3GPP TS 24.301 [3].
### 4.2.2 MME support of LCS
The network announces to the UE its ability to support LCS MO-LR mechanism in
E-UTRAN and GERAN/UTRAN using the EPS network feature support IE defined in
3GPP TS 24.301[3]. These information are taken into account by the UE, in
addition to UE's LCS and CSFB capabilities for UE to determine whether to
initiate EPC-MO-LR procedure or CS fallback procedure for CS-MO-LR in
GERAN/UTRAN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [8], subclause 8.3.1.
# 5 Support of LCS signaling
## 5.1 General
This clause defines the E-UTRAN LCS operations (subclause 5.2) and the format
and coding of the messages (subclause 5.3).
The messages defined in this subclause can be transported in the Downlink
Generic NAS Transport message and the Uplink Generic NAS Transport message
defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [3].
## 5.2 LCS operations
### 5.2.0 General
The operations defined in this subclause are for E-UTRAN LCS support only.
The MO-LR operation and the Location Notification operation for E-UTRAN LCS
are similar to that for GERAN and UTRAN LCS. The operations for GERAN and
UTRAN location signalling support are defined in 24.030 [6].
### 5.2.1 Network initiated location services operations
#### 5.2.1.1 Location Notification
##### 5.2.1.1.0 General
The Location Notification operation enables the MME to trigger the end-user
notification verification process on the UE using NAS signaling. The NAS
signaling (see 5.2.1.1.1) are transported using the Downlink Generic NAS
Transport message and the Uplink Generic NAS Transport message defined in 3GPP
TS 24.301 [3]. Figure 5.2.1.1.0-1 illustrates an example of the NAS signaling
transport for an EPC-MT-LR session.
Figure 5.2.1.1.0-1: NAS signaling transport for Location Notification
NOTE: The optional Additional Information IE of the Downlink/Uplink Generic
NAS Transport message is not used when the LCS Location Notification signaling
are transported in the Generic Message Container.
##### 5.2.1.1.1 Normal operation
The network invokes a location notification procedure by sending a REGISTER
message containing a LCS-LocationNotification invoke component to the UE. This
may be sent either to request verification for MT-LR or to notify about
already authorized MT-LR.
In case of privacy verification the UE shall respond to the request by sending
a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing the mobile subscriber\'s response in a
return result component (see figure 5.2.1.1.1-1).
If the timer T(LCSN) expires in the network before any response from the UE
(e.g. due to no response from the user), the network shall interpret this by
applying the default treatment defined in TS 3GPP 23.271 [2] (i.e. disallow
location if barred by subscription and allow location if allowed by
subscription).
In the case of location notification no response is required from the UE, the
UE shall terminate the dialogue by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message
containing a LocationNotification return result.
If the UE is unable to process the request received from the network, it shall
return an error indication by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing a
return error component. Error values are specified in 3GPP TS 24.080 [5].

used for E-UTRAN LCS:
\- molr-Type
\- lcs-QoS
\- lcsServiceTypeID
\- ageOfLocationInformation
\- locationType
\- mlc-Number
\- lcsClientExternalID
\- pseudonymIndicator
\- supportedGADShapes

NOTE: multiplePositioningProtocolPDUs IE is added to the LCS-MOLR Invoke to
allow for passing multiple UE positioning information LPP messages (e.g. UE
location measurements or UE capabilities) to the E-SMLC for E-UTRAN LCS. Its
ASN.1 description is given in 3GPP TS 24.080 [5].
#### 5.2.2.2 Mobile initiated Positioning Information Transport
The UE sends LPP message and the associated Routing Identifier in the Uplink
Generic NAS Transport message (Refer to 3GPP TS 24.301 [3]). Figure 5.2.2.2-1
illustrates an example of the NAS signaling transport for uplink LPP messages.
Figure 5.2.2.2-1: NAS signaling transport for uplink LPP messages
## 5.3 LCS messages and coding
### 5.3.1 Messages for common LCS operations
The LCS message format and information elements coding for the MO-LR and the
Location Notification operations (subclause 5.2) are defined in 24.080 [5] for
the following messages:
  * Register message
  * Facility message
  * Release Complete message
### 5.3.2 Messages for E-UTRAN LCS operations only
#### 5.3.2.1 LPP Messages
##### 5.3.2.1.1 Downlink Positioning Information Transport using LPP messages
The MME shall set the Generic Message Container Type to "LPP message
container" in the Downlink Generic NAS Transport message.
The MME includes a Routing Identifier in the Additional Information IE of the
Downlink Generic NAS Transport message associated with the positioning session
between the MME and E-SMLC.
The Routing identifier is the Correlation ID, which is defined in 3GPP TS
29.171 [7], so that the MME can map the Routing identifier to the Correlation
identifier when the MME receives an S1-AP Transport Message.
##### 5.3.2.1.2 Uplink Positioning Information Transport using LPP messages
The UE shall set the Generic Message Container Type to "LPP message container"
in the Uplink Generic NAS Transport message.
The UE includes a Routing Identifier received in the Additional Information IE
of the Downlink Generic NAS Transport message in the the Additional
Information IE of the Uplink Generic NAS Transport message. (See editor\'s
note below on Routing Identifier). This association of the Routing Identifier
is provided at the LPP level: the UpLink Generic NAS Transport message carries
an LPP message that is a response to or instigated by the LPP message in the
Downlink Generic NAS Transport message.The Routing identifier is the
Correlation ID, which is defined in 3GPP TS 29.171 [7], so that the MME can
map the Routing identifier to the Correlation identifier when the MME receives
an S1-AP Transport Message.
