# 1 Scope
This document specifies the identity management and authentication protocols
needed to support Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT). Identity management
applies only to on-network operation.
Mission critical communication services are services that require preferential
handling compared to normal telecommunication services, e.g. in support of
police or fire brigade.
The MCPTT service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications (e.g., utility companies and railways).
This document is applicable to User Equipment (UE) supporting the identity
management client functionality, and to application servers supporting the
identity management server functionality.
