# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines a number of Mission Critical Services (MCSs)
Management Objects (MO) that are configured for the UE for the operation of
MCSs. The management objects are compatible with OMA Device Management
protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA
DM Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler Release Definition
OMA OMA-ERELD_DM-V1_2 [2].
MCSs are services that require preferential handling compared to normal
telecommunication services, e.g. in support of police or fire brigade.
MCSs can be used for public safety applications and also for general
commercial applications (e.g., utility companies and railways).
The present document is applicable to an UE supporting on-line, off-line or
both on-line and off-line configuration of the configuration management
client.
The present document is applicable to an UE supporting off-line configuration
of the group management client.
The parameters defined by the management objects in the present document are
configured in the UE using on-line configuration over the CSC-4 reference
point and using off-line configuration over the CSC-11 and CSC-12 reference
points. Other specifications define how these parameters are used in the
operation of MCSs, and whether they are applicable to on-network operation or
off-network operation, or both:
\- 3GPP TS 24.379 [7]
\- 3GPP TS 24.380 [8]
\- 3GPP TS 24.381 [9]
\- 3GPP TS 24.382 [11]
\- 3GPP TS 24.384 [12]
The common network operation means both on-network operation and off-network
operation in the present document.
The following management objects are defined in the present document:
\- MCPTT UE configuration MO
\- MCPTT user profile MO
\- MCPTT group configuration MO
\- MCPTT service configuration MO
\- MCPTT UE initial configuration MO
The MOs listed above define repositories of data in the ME.

text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

# 4 MCPTT UE configuration MO
## 4.1 General
The MCPTT UE configuration Management Object (MO) is used to configure MCPTT
Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MCPTT Service. The MCPTT UE
configuration parameters may be stored in the ME, or in the USIM as specified
in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and the USIM. If both the ME and the
USIM contain the same parameters, the values stored in the USIM shall take
precedence.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCPTT-UE-
configuration:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCPTT UE configuration MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCPTT UE
configuration node as described in figure 4.1.1.

# 5 MCPTT user profile MO
## 5.1 General
The MCPTT user profile configuration Management Object (MO) is used to
configure the MCPTT Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MCPTT
Service. The MCPTT UE configuration parameters may be stored in the ME, or in
the USIM as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and the USIM.
If both the ME and the USIM contain the same parameters, the values stored in
the USIM shall take precedence.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCPTT-user-
profile:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCPTT user profile MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCPTT user profile
node as described in figure 5.1.1 and figure 5.1.2.

# 6 MCPTT group configuration MO
## 6.1 General
The MCPTT group configuration Management Object (MO) is used to configure the
MCPTT Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MCPTT Service. The
MCPTT group configuration parameters may be stored in the ME, or in the USIM
as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and the USIM. If both
the ME and the USIM contain the same parameters, the values stored in the USIM
shall take precedence.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCPTT-group-
configuration:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCPTT group configuration MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCPTT group
configuration node as described in figure 6.1.1.

# 7 MCPTT service configuration MO
## 7.1 General
The MCPTT service configuration Management Object (MO) is used to configure
MCPTT Client behaviour for the on-network or off-network MCPTT Service. The
MCPTT service configuration parameters may be stored in the ME, or in the USIM
as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [10], or in both the ME and the USIM. If both
the ME and the USIM contain the same parameters, the values stored in the USIM
shall take precedence.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-MCPTT-service-
configuration:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA OMA DM 1.2 [3].
The OMA DM ACL property mechanism (see OMA OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2]) may be used
to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and
leaf objects of the MCPTT service configuration MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the MCPTT service
configuration node as described in figure 7.1.1.
