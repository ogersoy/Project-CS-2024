# 1 Scope
This document defines a mobile device 3GPP IMS Management Object. The
management object is compatible with OMA Device Management protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler Release Definition
OMA-ERELD _DM-V1_2 [12].
The 3GPP IMS Management Object consists of relevant parameters that can be
managed for the IM CN Subsystem. This includes the basic framework defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [4] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], and early IMS as defined in 3GPP TS
23.221 [3]. This also includes relevant parameters that can be managed for the
application of SMS over IP networks defined in 3GPP TS 24.341 [5a].
The IMS Management Object defines a repository of data into the ME including
parameters that are provisioned from the ISIM application (i.e. 3GPP TS 31.103
[11]) or, after derivation, from the USIM application (i.e. 3GPP TS 31.102
[10]).

Subsystem protocols. The Management Object covers generic parameters for the
IM CN subsystem. The Management Object enables the management of the settings
on behalf of the end user.

for the media controlled by IM CN subsystem.
NOTE: When value 1 is set, the network initiates resource allocation for the
media controlled by IM CN subsystem.
In absence of the parameter, UE attempts to initiate resource allocation for
the media controlled by IM CN subsystem when a certain ICSI is used for the
IMS session and when both UE and network can initiate resource allocation.

\- Values: \'FQDN\', \'IPv4\', \'IPv6\'.

NOTE: Populating P-CSCF address list with only entries havingAddressType
values of either \'IPv4\' or \'IPv6\' results in coupling of the home
operator\'s network topology to the data stored in the IMS MO in the UE.
Unless the list also contains at least one entry of type FQDN, any changes in
the network topology will have to be followed by the update of the IMS MO of
each affected UE before service could be restored for that UE.

originate voice sessions. In addition, a UE, in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.292
[16], upon receiving a request for a session including voice, preferably
attempts to use the CS domain for the audio media stream. This value equates
to \"CS Voice preferred, IMS PS Voice as secondary\" as described in 3GPP TS
23.221 [14].
3 -- Indicates that the UE preferably attempts to use the IM CN Subsystem
using an E-UTRAN bearer to originate sessions including voice. In addition, a
UE, in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.292 [16], upon receiving a request for a
session including voice, preferably attempts to use an E-UTRAN bearer for the
audio media stream. This value equates to \"IMS PS Voice preferred, CS Voice
as secondary\" as described in 3GPP TS 23.221 [14].
4 -- Indicates that the UE attempts to initiate voice sessions over IM CN
Subsystem using an E-UTRAN bearer. In addition, a UE, upon receiving a request
for a session including voice, attempts to use an E-UTRAN bearer for all the
the audio media stream(s). This value equates to \"IMS PS Voice only\" as
described in 3GPP TS 23.221 [14].
NOTE: For Voice_Domain_Preference_E_UTRAN leaf values 2, 3 and 4, whether the
UE does attempt to use the IM CN subsystem using an E-UTRAN bearer for voice
session initiation or termination is further guided by the \"IMS Voice over PS
session\" indicator. See 3GPP TS 24.301 [15] and 3GPP TS 24.292 [16].
## 5.28 /_\ _/SMS_Over_IP_Networks_Indication

the IM CN Subsystem using an UTRAN PS bearer. This value equates to \"CS Voice
only\" as described in 3GPP TS 23.221 [14].
2 -- Indicates that the UE preferably attempts to use the CS domain to
originate voice sessions. In addition, a UE, in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.292
[16], upon receiving a request for a session including voice, preferably
attempts to use the CS domain for the audio media stream. This value equates
to \"CS Voice preferred, IMS PS Voice as secondary\" as described in 3GPP TS
23.221 [14].
3 -- Indicates that the UE preferably attempts to use the IM CN Subsystem
using an UTRAN PS bearer to originate sessions including voice. In addition, a
UE, in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.292 [16], upon receiving a request for a
session including voice, preferably attempts to use an UTRAN PS bearer for the
audio media stream. This value equates to \"IMS PS Voice preferred, CS Voice
as secondary\" as described in 3GPP TS 23.221 [14].
## 5.31 /_\ _/Mobility_Management_IMS_Voice_Termination

## 5.41 /_\ _/SS_domain_setting
The SS_domain_setting leaf indicates the network operator\'s preference for
the selection of the domain used by the UE when performing supplementary
services (SS) setting control for voice services.
NOTE 1: The SS_domain_setting leaf does not provide a mechanism for the
network operator to select the domain used for mobile originating USSD
requests.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: int
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: 0, 1, 2
0 -- Indicates that the UE only uses the PS domain for SS setting control
1 -- Indicates that the UE only uses the CS domain for SS setting control
2 - Indicates that the UE uses the PS domain for SS setting control when the
PS domain is being used by the UE for voice services, and the UE uses the CS
domain for SS setting control when the CS domain is being used by the UE for
voice services
The network operator can select the preference for the selection of the domain
used by the UE when performing supplementary services (SS) setting control for
voice services, according to the domain(s) where the supplementary services
are provisioned. For example:
\- if the supplementary services are provisioned only in the PS domain, the UE
can be restricted to configure only the supplementary services part of the IMS
multimedia telephony communication service by setting value \"0\";
NOTE 2: If voice services are centralized in IMS, and if the UE accesses the
CS domain for voice services, the supplementary services part of the IMS
multimedia telephony communication service can also be configured in the PS
domain by the UE.
\- if the supplementary services are provisioned only in the CS domain, the UE
can be restricted to configure only the supplementary services for CS speech
by setting value \"1\"; and
NOTE 3: If the supplementary services are provisioned in the PS domain, then
the supplementary services part of the IMS multimedia telephony communication
service can also be configured by a UE accessing the CS domain towards an MSC
server enhanced for ICS implementing the interworking between call independent
supplementary service signalling and the XCAP application usage for
manipulating supplementary services data, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.292 [22].
\- if the supplementary services are provisioned in both the CS domain and PS
domain, then value \"2\" can be set to restrict the UE to:
a) configure the supplementary services for CS speech when the UE is using the
CS domain for voice services; and
b) configure the supplementary services part of the IMS multimedia telephony
communication service when the UE is using the PS domain for voice services.
## 5.42 /_\ _/PS_domain_IMS_SS_control_preference
The PS_domain_IMS_SS_control_preference leaf provides a means to define the
method for which Supplementary Services as defined by 3GPP TS 22.173 [19] are
controlled by the UE when SS setting control is to be invoked over the PS
domain.

\- Format: bool
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: 0, 1

22.173 [19] is to be invoked using SIP-based user configuration as defined by
3GPP TS 24.238 [21]
NOTE: The usage of other methods for controlling the IMS SS setting control

The UE uses the information stored in the PS_domain_IMS_SS_control_preference
leaf either when the SS_domain_setting leaf is set to \"0\", or when
SS_domain_setting is set to \"2\" and the domain currently used for voice
services is the PS domain.

###### ## Annex B (informative): 3GPP IMS Client Provisioning Application
Characteristics (CP AC)
# B.1 General
This annex defines the 3GPP IMS Client Provisioning Application
Characteristics (CP AC) as supported in the Enabler Release Definition OMA-
ERELD-DM-V1_2 [12].
If the initial IMS parameters cannot be provisioned as specified in OMA-ERELD-
DM-V1_2 [12], initial IMS parameters can be provisioned using OMA CP.
If a client is provisioned with 3GPP IMS related parameters by both OMA DM and
OMA CP, the client will use the 3GPP IMS related parameters provisioned by OMA
DM.
