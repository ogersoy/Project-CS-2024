# 1 Scope
The purpose of the present document is to give an implementation guide to the
relevant Common IMS specifications and functions used in the interconnection
of a Next Generation Corporate Network site (NGCN site) to the NGN.
The present document addresses control plane signalling (usage of SIP and SDP
protocols, required SIP headers) as well as other interconnecting aspects like
security, numbering/naming/addressing and user plane issues such as transport
protocol, media and codecs actually covered in a widespread set of 3GPP and
ETSI TISPAN specifications, as seen from the perspective of an NGCN site.
Advice-of-charge aspects are addressed as far as SIP signalling is concerned.
The present document is based on 3GPP TS 24.229 [12].

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Business Trunking architecture and protocols
Business trunking refers to an architecture where corporate networks appear to
the NGN as an NGCN.
3GPP TS 24.525 [3] and 3GPP TS 22.519 [2] provide architecture and functional
requirements for business trunking making use of IMS and foresee two main
interconnection models: the subscription based approach, where the entry point
to the IMS is the P-CSCF, and the peering based approach, where the entry
point to the IMS is the IBCF.
In both arrangement scenarios, aiming to support business trunking, protocol
interconnection has to occur between NGCN and NGN:
\- at a control plane level, in order that IMS procedures can be supported;
\- at a user plane level, where media streams are exchanged.
The management of IP multimedia sessions is achieved using SIP. The transport
mechanism for both SIP session signalling and media is UDP or TCP over IPv4
(RFC 791 [13]) or IPv6 (RFC 2460 [14]); for signalling optionally also TLS
over TCP.
The protocol behaviour of the NGN functional entities involved in the
signalling plane interconnection (IBCF, P-CSCF) is specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[12].
The protocol behaviour of the NGCN is also expected to follow 3GPP TS 24.229
[12], subject to the applicable interconnection scenario:
\- for the subscription-based approach the behaviour is based on the rules for
a UE;
\- for the peering-based approach the NGCN site appears to the NGN as if it
were an IBCF complying with the requirements identified in 3GPPTS 24.229 [12],
subclause 4.1 for this functional entity.
The present document presents guidelines for NGCNs connecting to an NGN for
the purpose of business trunking.
NOTE: A given NGCN can have multiple business trunking arrangements with the
same NGN or with different NGNs, some using the subscription-based approach
and others using the peering-based approach.
## 4.2 Roadmap to relevant specifications
The following specifications are relevant for the implementation of the NGCN-
NGN interface:
\- 3GPP TS 22.519 [2] provides Business Communication Requirements.
\- 3GPP TS 24.523 [4] provides architecture and functional description of Core
and enterprise NGN interaction scenarios.
\- 3GPP TS 24.525 [3] gives architecture and functional description of
Business trunking.
\- 3GPP TS 24.229 [12] defines a call control protocol for use in the IP
Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based on the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP), and the associated Session Description Protocol (SDP).
## 4.3 Specification methodology
### 4.3.1 General
Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the present document describe the various aspects of an
NGN-NGCN interconnection, including a description of SIP and SDP procedures,
and the SIP methods and header fields to be supported, in the form of a series
of tables and description.
Aspects common to both the subscription-based and the peering-based scenario
are described in clause 5. Considerations for a particular scenario are
covered in clauses 6 and 7 respectively.
The tables summarize key aspects of IMS SIP used in business trunking and are
aligned with similar tables available in annex A of 3GPP TS 24.229 [12]. Each
of the tables in the present document include two \"Status\" columns, one for
the sending side, one for the receiving side. The status entries represent the
requirements on an NGCN acting as sender / as receiver of a SIP message. The
present document is an informative document and as such does not specify any
changes to SIP described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [12].
NOTE: The present document in some cases selects options from the baseline
specifications. As an example, if the \"status\" column in the baseline
specification indicates a condition for supporting a particular header field
and that condition is always met by the implementation of the interface to an
NGCN site then the \"profile status\" column for this header field is marked
\"mandatory\" rather than \"optional\" or \"conditionally mandatory\" in the
present document. Similarly if the \"status\" column in the baseline
specification indicates that support of a particular header field is optional
and the implementation of the interface to an NGCN site always require it then
the \"profile status\" column for this header field is marked \"mandatory\"
rather than \"optional\".
The notation for status codes is explained in subclause 4.3.2.
There are cases where the status of a method or a header field depends on
capabilities supported at the NGCN-NGN interface. In such a case, the status
indicated in the tables depends on the status of the respective capability, as
described in subclause 4.4.
### 4.3.2 Notation for status codes
The following notations, defined in ISO/IEC 9646‑7 [41], are used for the
status column:
\- m: mandatory - the capability is required to be supported.
\- o: optional - the capability may be supported or not.
\- n/a: not applicable - in the given context, it is impossible to use the
capability.
\- x: prohibited (excluded) - there is a requirement not to use this
capability in the given context.
\- o.i: qualified optional - for mutually exclusive or selectable options from
a set. \"i\" is an integer, which identifies a unique group of related
optional items and the logic of their selection, which is defined immediately
following the table.
\- ci: conditional - the requirement on the capability (\"m\", \"o\", \"x\" or
\"n/a\") depends on the support of other optional or conditional items. \"i\"
is an integer identifying a unique conditional status expression which is
defined immediately following the table.
In the status columns of tables within subsequent sections, status codes m, o,
c, x and n/a have the following meanings, as specified in the base standards,
with the following qualifications:
\- Conformance requirements are indicated in static terms, meaning that a
behaviour indicated as mandatory shall be observed when the implementation is
placed in conditions in which the conformance requirements of the reference
specification compel it to do so. For instance, if the support for a header
field in a sent message is indicated as mandatory, it does not mean that the
NGCN shall always include that header field when sending the message
concerned, but that the NGCN shall include that header field in the message
concerned in circumstances specified in the reference specification.
\- If support for a particular behaviour is required, there is no requirement
for every SIP-capable entity within the NGCN to support that behaviour, but at
least one element involved shall support that behaviour. For instance, if the
support for a header field in a sent message is indicated as mandatory, it
does not mean that all NGCN entities involved in handling the message to be
sent shall support inclusion of that header field, but at least one NGCN
entity shall be able to insert that header field such that it appears in the
resulting message sent to the NGN.
\- When appearing in a column relating to sending by an NGCN, the notation
\'m\' means that an NGCN shall support this capability when sending a message.
\- When appearing in a column relating to receiving by an NGCN, the notation
\'m\' means that an NGCN shall support this capability when present in a
received message.
\- The notation \'o\' means that the capability may or may not be supported by
an NGCN, this being an implementation choice.
\- When appearing in a column relating to sending by an NGCN, the notation
\'n/a\' means that there is no requirement for an NGCN to support this
capability when sending a message.
\- When appearing in a column relating to receiving by an NGCN, the notation
\'n/a\' means that there is no requirement for an NGCN to support this
capability when present in a received message.
\- When appearing in a column relating to sending by an NGCN, the notation
\'x\' means that an NGCN shall not use this capability when sending a message.
\- When appearing in a column relating to receiving by an NGCN, the notation
\'x\' means that an NGCN shall ignore this capability when present in a
received message.

### 4.4.2 Protocol capabilities
#### 4.4.2.1 General
The NGCN is expected to support the following SIP capabilities under the
stated circumstances.
#### 4.4.2.2 Basic requirements
**Session control:** The support of INVITE initiated dialogs is mandatory if
media sessions are supported across the NGCN - NGN interface where media can
be any mix of audio, video, and application data. In\ subscription-based
approach both UAC and UAS side procedures are applicable; in peering-based
approach proxy procedures may apply as well.
**Registration, client side:** Mandatory when working in subscription mode,
not applicable in peering mode.
**Event notification framework:** SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY support is mandatory if any
SIP event package is supported. Depending on the package the NGCN will act as
subscriber or as notifier.
**Event state publication:** Support of the PUBLISH method is optional.
**Messaging:** Support of the MESSAGE method is mandatory if instant messages
are supported. There is no specific use case specified in 3GPP TS 24.525 [3]
that requires an NGCN to send the MESSAGE method.\ See table 5.1 for details
on the support of the MESSAGE method on sending and receiving sides. In 3GPP
TS 23.228 [17] it is only specified for a UE to support Messaging, that
implies that it is mandatory in the case of Subscription based approach.
**UA-UA Authentication (Digest)** (see [1], subclause 22.2): mandatory for
REPLACES or JOIN else optional.
**UA-Proxy Authentication (Digest)** (see [1], subclause 20.28, 22.3):
optional.
#### 4.4.2.3 Extensions for session control
The following bullets list a number of SIP extensions and their status for the
NGCN-NGN interface. The list is not exhaustive but contains all items relevant
to the NGCN-NGN interface.
\- Fixes for non-INVITE transactions (see [61]): mandatory.
\- Fork-loop fixes (see [53]): mandatory if forking in NGCN is possible else
not applicable.
\- Reliable provisional responses (PRACK) (see [6]): mandatory if using
session preconditions else optional.
\- INFO method (see [5]): optional; required for AoC.
\- REFER method, Referred-by header field (see [7], [33]): both optional.
\- UPDATE method (see [8]): optional.
\- Session Preconditions (for QoS) (see [54], [55]): mandatory if initiating a
session requiring resource reservation else optional.
\- Symmetric response routing (see [58]): optional.
\- Caller preferences (see [23]): optional.
\- Callee capabilities (see [59]): optional.
\- Replaces (see [39]): optional.
\- Join (see [26]): optional.
\- P-Asserted-Identity (see [29]): mandatory.
\- Privacy (see [30]): mandatory (privacy value \'id\').
\- P-Called-Party-ID (see [28]): optional; not applicable for peering mode.
\- P-Access-Network-Info (see [28]): mandatory for GPRS, 3GPP2, I-WLAN and
DOCSIS IP-CAN access types and optional for the others.
\- Session timer (see [27]): optional.
\- UA-UA and UA-Proxy Authentication (Digest) (see [1]): both optional.
\- History-Info and privacy of history info (see [25]): optional.
\- GRUUs (see [63]): optional.
\- ICE (see [72]): optional.
\- SIP Outbound (see [65]): optional.
\- Location conveyance (see [24]): optional.
\- Service URNs (e.g. \'sos\') (see [62]): mandatory.
\- Private Network Traffic (see [77]): optional.
\- Authorization of Early Media (see [38]): optional.
\- Identification of communication services extension (P-Preferred-Service)
(see [34]): optional in the subscription-based approach, not applicable in the
peering based approach.
\- SIP extensions for media authorization ([37]): optional
#### 4.4.2.4 Extensions for registration (subscription based approach only)
The following bullets list a number of SIP extensions and their status for the
NGCN-NGN interface. The list is not exhaustive but contains all items relevant
to the NGCN-NGN interface.
\- **UA-Registrar Authentication** (see [1]): mandatory.
\- **Session initiation protocol extension header field for registering non-
adjacent contacts (Path header field)** (see [56]): mandatory. The support of
the extension is indicated in the Supported header field sent by the NGCN. It
is up to the NGCN whether it uses the Path header field received in the 200 OK
response.
\- **Reg-event package** (see [45]): mandatory.
> Subscription to the reg-event package provided by the NGN enables the NGN
> with the following capabilities:
\- informing the NGCN about the implicitly registered public user identities;
\- informing the NGCN about the registration state of all explicitly and
implicitly registered public user identities;
\- forcing the NGCN at any time to perform re-registration after a NGN
determined time (network initiated re-registration);
\- network initiated de-registration of one or more registered public user
identities of the NGCN.
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 24.229 [12] mandates the support of the \'reg\' event package.
In particular the last two capabilities above are needed by the NGN operator
e.g. in cases when the network wants to re-authenticate the user (network
initiated re-registration) or when the S-CSCF needs to shut down for
maintenance purposes and the user should register newly at a different S-CSCF
(network initiated de-registration).
\- **Session initiation protocol extension header field for service route
discovery during registration (Service-Route header field)** (see [57]):
mandatory. If the UE does not set the content of the Service-Route received
during the last successful registration or re-registration, in a Route header
field of an outgoing SIP Request, the P-CSCF may reject this request.
\- **The P-Associated-URI header extension (P-Associated-URI header field)**
(see [29]): mandatory.
NOTE 2: TS 24.229 [12] mandates the support of the P-Associated-URI header
field to enable the NGN to provide to the UE the implicitly registered public
user identities. There is no requirement in\ TS 24.525 [3] to use this header

# 5 Common guidelines
## 5.1 Reference model for interconnection
The reference model for interconnection is scenario specific; refer to
subclause 6.1 for the subscription-based approach and to subclause 7.1 for the
peering based method of interconnection.
## 5.2 Control plane interconnection
### 5.2.1 SIP procedures
#### 5.2.1.1 Outgoing requests from NGCN site
##### 5.2.1.1.1 General
The following subclauses provide guidance on the expected NGCN site behaviour
when sending a request to the NGN and receiving a response from the NGN.
Allowed formats for URIs are listed in subclause 5.4, but other formats may
possibly be used by agreement between enterprise and NGN.
The terms **trust** , **trusted by** and **trust domain** in the following
subclauses are used as defined in RFC 3324 [82] and\ relate only to the
handling of P-Asserted-Identity and Privacy:id header fields as specified in
RFC 3325 [29].\ RFC 3324 [82] defines Spec (T) as the set of specifications
and configuration settings that are used to ensure trust.
The trust relationship between NGCN sites and NGN is a matter of an SLA
between enterprise and NGN operator. If according to the SLA the NGN and NGCN
form part of the same trust domain, the SLA includes a Spec (T) applicable to
the interconnection of NGCN and NGN. In this case the NGN trusts the NGCN site
and vice versa (as described in RFC 3324 [82]). On the other hand the NGCN
site may trust the NGN even if the NGCN site is not in the trust domain of the
NGN.
NOTE 1: TS 24.525 [3] talks about trust only in the context of the NGN
trusting the NGCN regarding the SIP header fields P-Asserted-Identity and
related Privacy provided by the NGCN in a SIP request or SIP response.
NOTE 2: According to RFC 3324 [82], for an NGCN site outside the trust domain,
trusting the NGN implies both secured signalling and knowledge that the peer
NGN entity belongs to a recognized trust domain. As a consequence signalling
that is not secured is equivalent to not trusting the NGN
NOTE 3: Trust is required if privacy applies; for identities that are not
subject to privacy it is a matter of policy whether they are passed to a non-
trusted node.
##### 5.2.1.1.2 Calling and connected identifiers
When sending a request to the NGN the NGCN site can include a calling party
identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field in accordance with RFC 3325
[29].
NOTE 1: If included, the asserted identity is in addition to the identity
provided by the calling party in the From header field.
The NGCN site can provide two P-Asserted-Identity header fields, one
containing a SIP URI and the other containing a TEL URI, in order to provide
alias identities for the calling party (see TS 22.519 [2]).
The handling of the P-Asserted-Identity header field(s) by the NGN depends on
whether the NGN trusts the NGCN or not and on the scenario (subscription based
or peering).
NOTE 2: If the NGN trusts the NGCN site it will accept a P-Asserted-Identity
received from the NGCN.
A calling identifier in a From or P-Asserted-Identity header field is expected
to comply with the formats listed in subclause 5.4 where an entity internal to
the NGCN site is identified.
The NGCN site may receive a connected party identity in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field in a 18x or 2xx final response depending on NGN policy
and the trust relationship between NGN and NGCN.
##### 5.2.1.1.3 Privacy
If the NGCN site requires privacy for the calling party identity it will
include a Privacy:id header field when sending a request to the NGN.
NOTE 1: This header field asks the NGN not to send a P-Asserted-Identity to a
recipient outside its trust domain.
NOTE 2: The calling party will also put an anonymous SIP URI into the From
header field if privacy is required.
The NGCN site may insert a P-Asserted-Identity header field in addition to
Privacy:id if it trusts the NGN. If the NGCN site does not trust the NGN the
NGCN site will not include a P-Asserted-Identity for which privacy is
required.
##### 5.2.1.1.4 Called identifier
The To header field may contain any URI format. The Request-URI has to be in a
format supported by the NGN for the request to be accepted. TS 24.229 [12]
subclause 5.1.2A.1.2 gives information on the format of the Request-UR
#### 5.2.1.2 Incoming requests to NGCN site
##### 5.2.1.2.1 General
The following subclauses provide guidance on the common aspects of expected
NGCN site behaviour when receiving a request from the NGN.
The text from subclause 5.2.1.1.1 on trust also applies here.
The supported URI formats are listed in subclause 5.4.
##### 5.2.1.2.2 Calling identity
The NGCN site can receive a user provided calling identity in the From header
field and an asserted calling identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header
field. The P-Asserted-Identity can be accompanied by a Privacy:id header field
if presentation of this identity is restricted and the NGN trusts the NGCN.
Conditions under which the NGN will send such identities depend on the
availability of the information and on privacy requirements as specified in TS
24.525 [3] and TS 24.229 [12], and are also subject to an SLA between NGN and
NGCN.
##### 5.2.1.2.3 Called identity
The NGCN site may return a called party identity, which may or may not be one
of the public user identities allocated to the NGCN site, in form of a
P-Asserted-Identity header field in a 18x or 2xx response, as specified in\ TS
24.525 [3].
##### 5.2.1.2.4 Request-URI
For an initial or standalone request the Request-URI will normally contain a
public user identity assigned to the NGCN; an exception will be an initial
call to a globally routable contact address, e.g. in the case of an emergency
call-back.
NOTE: For a mid-dialog request the Request-URI will contain the target URI
learned from the respective Contact header field at dialog establishment time
or through the most recent target refreshment.
### 5.2.2 SIP protocol elements
#### 5.2.2.1 General
NOTE: The status of some header fields and parameters described in this
subclause may not be applicable in case of private network traffic. Further
study is required to identify the list of header fields that must be supported
to ensure proper handling of private traffic in the IMS.
#### 5.2.2.2 Methods
Table 5.1 provides information on the SIP methods to be supported by the NGCN
site for the connection to the NGN.
It is based on tables A.5 and A.163 of TS 24.229 [12] and considering Business
Trunking specific requirements as described in TS 24.525 [3].

#### 5.2.2.4 Header fields
##### 5.2.2.4.1 General
The following subclauses list header fields with a specific relevance in a
business trunking context. The usage of these header fields follows normal SIP
rules, with some additional qualifications as described below.
##### 5.2.2.4.2 Accept
As specified in TS 24.525 [3], if the agreement between the NGN and the NGCN
specifies that an NGCN site receives advice of charge information, this header
field indicates the support of MIME bodies of type
\"application/vnd.etsaoc+xml\" defined in TS 24.647 [80].
##### 5.2.2.4.3 Allow
As specified in TS 24.525 [3], if the agreement between the NGN and the NGCN
specifies that an NGCN site receives advice of charge information, this header
field indicates the support of the INFO method.
##### 5.2.2.4.4 Contact
In an outgoing dialog initiating or target refresh request this header field
contains the target URI within the NGCN (which can be different from the
public user identities assigned to the NGCN site) for receiving subsequent
mid-dialog requests. This URI may also be suitable for receiving future out-
of-dialog requests.
In a 2xx final response to an incoming dialog initiating or target refresh
request this header field contains the target URI within the NGCN (which can
be different from the public user identities assigned to the NGCN site) for
receiving subsequent mid-dialog requests. This URI may also be suitable for
receiving future out-of-dialog requests.
##### 5.2.2.4.5 Max-Breadth
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, the Max-Breadth header
field can prevent loops by limiting forking within the NGCN site.
##### 5.2.2.4.6 Max-Forwards
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, the Max-Forwards header
field can prevent loops by limiting the number of nodes that can forward the
request within the NGCN site.
##### 5.2.2.4.7 P-Private-Network-Indication
As stated in TS 24.525 [3], the NGN can include a Private-Network-Indicator
header field as specified in draft-vanelburg-sipping-private-network-
indication [77] in an initial request or standalone request to the NGCN site,
and the NGCN site can include this header field in an initial request or
standalone request to the NGN.
##### 5.2.2.4.8 Record-Route
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, this header field may be
populated by entities within the NGCN site
  * in a dialog initiating request sent to the NGN;
  * in a response to a dialog initiating request received from the NGN.
When internally received by the NGCN attachment point, this header field has
to be passed on by the attachment point and the attachment point can also add
its own Record-Route header field.
##### 5.2.2.4.9 Route
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, the header field may
contain additional URIs addressing nodes within the NGCN site in a request
received from the NGN.
NOTE: The NGN may know the route set within the NGCN site from a Record-Route
received earlier on the same dialog, through configuration, or from a Path
header field received during registration when working in subscription mode.
##### 5.2.2.4.10 Via
As an NGCN site may comprise multiple SIP entities, this header field may be
populated by multiple entities within the NGCN site in an outgoing request to
the NGN.
##### 5.2.2.4.11 Summary of message headers
The following tables provide information on the SIP header fields to be
supported by the NGCN site for the interconnection to the NGN.
As per the procedures specified in RFC 3261 [1], the NGCN site shall ignore
received unknown SIP header fields and unknown header field parameters and
continue processing the request or response where they were contained.
The tables below are based on clause A.2 of TS 24.229 [12] and considering
Business Trunking specific requirements as described in TS 24.525 [3].

#### 5.2.2.5 Supported Message bodies
According to TS 24.229 [12] SIP message body handling follows the rules of RFC
5621 [87]; see item 82 of table A.4 (for a UE) and item 92 of table 162 (for a
proxy). These rules require that a UE supports \'multipart/mixed\' and
\'multipart/alternative\' body types; for a proxy support is optional
(dependent on whether the proxy will examine body contents).
If the NGCN supports conditions under which two or more body parts will have
to be included in a single SIP message (for example SDP and location
information) it has to be prepared to send and receive a \'multipart/mixed\'
or \'multipart/alternative\' body in appropriate SIP messages.
Besides that the NGCN site is expected to support the message body types
listed below:
  * application/sdp: mandatory for both receiving and sending side
  * application/vnd.etsaoc+xml for the Advice of Charge service: as specified in subclause 6.1.12 of TS 24.525 [3] mandatory for the receiving side if advice of charge is supported, not applicable otherwise.
  * application/pidf+xml in accordance with RFC 4119 [78] and draft-ietf-sip-location-conveyance [24]:
```{=html}
``` \- mandatory for the sending side if geographical location has to be sent
(unless location information is sent by reference) as specified in subclause
5.1.6.8 of TS 24.229 [12] or if NGCN has to act as a presentity (presence
service);
  * mandatory for the receiving side if NGCN has to act as a presence watcher or if the NGCN supports location based services.
Further body types may be allowed across the NGN-NGCN interface, e.g. under a
service level agreement.
NOTE: Conditions for supporting pidf+xml for basic presence services require
further studies as well as the conditions for supporting multipart bodies.
#### 5.2.2.6 Event packages
The NGCN site supported event packages are listed below:
Table 5.28: Supported event packages
* * *
**Item** **Does the implementation support** **Ref.** **Subscriber**
**Notifier** 2 refer package? [7] 3 o o 3 presence package? [43] 6 o o 4

### 5.2.3 SDP protocol
### 5.2.3 SDP protocol
For the NGCN the provisions of clause 6 of TS 24.229 [12] and TS 24.525 [3],
for a UE apply with the following qualifications:
\- At a minimum the NGCN is expected to support SDP offer / answer exchanges
as described RFC 3264 (June 2002): \"An Offer/Answer Model with Session
Description Protocol (SDP) [91]_._
\- Reliable provisional responses and the PRACK method are optional, and
neither side must depend on SDP carried in a 18x response or a PRACK message.
The NGCN site shall not require reliable provisional responses (i.e. 100rel
option in Require header field) on outgoing INVITE requests
\- If the UPDATE method is supported it can be used for SDP offer/answer
exchange before and after the call has been answered.
\- TS 24.229 [12] requires inclusion of a bandwidth parameter for audio and
video media lines.
\- According to TS 24.229 [12] an offer-answer cycle should result in a single
codec per media type; if this is not the case a further offer should be issued
to eliminate all codecs except the selected one.
The support of SDP extensions is detailed in table 5.29.

The following table provide information on the SDP protocol to be supported by
the NGCN site for the interconnection to the NGN.
It is based on tables A.317, A.318 and A.319 of TS 24.229 [12] and considering
Business Trunking specific requirements as described in TS 24.525 [3].

* * *
### 5.2.4 Control plane transport
This depends on the method of interconnection; see subclause 6.2.4 for the
subscription-based and subclause 7.2.4 for the peering-based method.
## 5.3 User plane interconnection
### 5.3.1 Media and Codec
5.3.1.1 DTMF
As specified in TS 24.229 [12], an NGCN site shall include the MIME subtype
\"telephone-event\" in the media description in the SDP for audio media flows
that support both audio codec and DTMF payloads in RTP packets as described in
RFC 4733 [67].
If the MIME subtype \"telephone-event\" is not supported by the remote party,
the NGCN site should be able to send and receive DTMF in the media flow using
a suitable audio codec negotiated in the offer/answer exchange.
5.3.1.2 Codecs
TS 181 005 [79] specifies principles for the use of codecs in the NGN.
Specifically TS 181 005 [79] mandates that the \"NGN shall allow end to end
negotiation of any codec between NGN entities (terminal, network elements)\".
Although no direct requirement is placed on entities within the NGCN; by merit
of the fact that SIP is used as the protocol for the interconnect it is clear
that the NGCN-NGN interconnection interface shall allow end to end negotiation
of any codec between NGCN and NGCN/NGN entities.
If the NGCN supports narrow band voice services then, as specified in TS 181
005 [79], in order to enable interworking for narrow band voice services for
public traffic, the NGCN shall be capable of sending and receiving ITU‑T
Recommendation G.711 [89] coded speech with a packetization size of 20 ms.
5.3.1.3 Modification of media session parameters
As specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [12], modifications of the characteristics of
the media session) can be issued by the NGCN site or by the NGN by sending a
re-INVITE request. The ability to support modifications of early dialogs
depends on the support of the UPDATE and PRACK methods (see table 5.1).
## 5.4 Numbering, naming and addressing
The following URI formats in SIP messages apply at the NGCN-NGN
interconnection as standardized in\ 3GPP TS 24.229 [12] in order to provide
business trunking services:
\- SIP URI as defined in RFC 3261 [1], with the following qualifications:
\- The SIP URI can be either based on an E.164 number or a private number or
it can be an e-mail style SIP URI, including device identifiers such as GRUUs.
\- Dial strings are not present on the NGCN-NGN interface.
\- As specified in [1], the \";user=phone\" parameter is present in SIP URIs
in which the user part is a telephone-subscriber string.
\- As specified in [1], the \";user=phone\" parameter is not present in SIP
URIs in which the user part is not a telephone-subscriber string in compliance
with the tel URI definition of RFC 3966 [18]. According to this requirement,
the phone-context parameter is mandatory when the user part of a SIP URI with
a \";user=phone\" parameter is not a global number.
\- Tel URI defined in RFC 3966 [18] and according to the requirements defined
in ECMA TR/96 [22]:
\- In accordance with RFC 3966 [18], the phone-context parameter is mandatory
when the tel URI contains a private number.
In addition, the following URI formats in SIP Request-URIs may be applied at
the NGCN-NGN interconnection as standardized in TS 24.229 [12] for the support
of presence and instant messaging:
\- IM URI defined in RFC 3860 [19];
\- PRES URI defined in RFC 3859 [20].
Other URI formats may also be supported over the NGCN-NGN interconnection
depending on the NGN operator and its customer agreements.
NOTE: The NGN behaviour in case of URIs that do not comply with the specified
formats is outside the scope of the present document.
## 5.5 IP Version
The network elements interconnected on the NGCN-NGN Interconnection may
support IPv4 only, IPv6 only or both.
The support of one or both of the IP versions is an option and should be based
on bilateral agreement.
The control plane and the user plane may use different IP addresses and
different IP versions.
In case IPv4 and IPv6 networks are interconnected, as specified in TS 24.229
[12], annex G and TS 29.162 [21], the involved P-CSCF shall apply the IP
version interworking procedures for\ NA(P)-T-PT.
## 5.6 Security
5.6.1 Authentication
The authentication mechanism used on the NGCN-NGN interconnection should be
part of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the operator and the
enterprise.
It is expected that different mechanisms will apply for the two methods of
interconnection; see subclause 6.6.1 for the subscription based approach and
subclause 7.6.1 for the peering-based method.
# 6 Specific guidelines for the subscription based approach
## 6.1 Reference model for interconnection
### 6.1.1 General
The architectural split of the service layer and transport layer (used in the
description below) is defined in ES 282 001 [16].
Clause 5.2 of TS 24.525 [3] describes the architectural requirements for the
connection of an Next Generation Corporate Network site (NGCN site) to the NGN
using the P-CSCF as an entry point at the service layer.
Clause 8.3 of TS 24.523 [4] shows the arrangement of the involved functional
entities.
### 6.1.2 Functionalities performed by entities at the service layer
#### 6.1.2.1 P-CSCF, S-CSCF
According to TS 24.525 [3], for the subscription based scenario the P-CSCF is
the first contact point for the NGCN site within the IM subsystem (IMS). The
NGCN site attaches to the P-CSCF at the Gm reference point.
The S-CSCF provides home server functions for the NGCN site, making use of the
HSS as necessary.
Further definition of the P-CSCF and S-CSCF is provided in TS 23.228 [17] as
modified by ES 282 007 [42].
#### 6.1.2.2 AS
Business trunking may involve a dedicated application server that provides
business trunking specific capabilities and may need to access the HSS for
that purpose.
NOTE: If P-CSCF and S-CSCF together provide all business trunking related
functions then no AS is needed.
#### 6.1.2.3 NGCN
The NGCN site appears to the NGN like a UE attached to the P-CSCF at the Gm
reference point.
### 6.1.3 Functionalities performed by entities at the transport layer
#### 6.1.3.1 C-BGF
According to TS 24.525 [3], the main functional entity that is used at the
transport layer to realise subscription‑based business trunking and that is
involved on the NGN-NGCN interface is the Core Border Gateway Function
(C-BGF).
The C-BGF sits at the boundary between an access network and a core network
and provides the interface between two IP-transport domains. Further
definition of the C-BGF is provided in ES 282 001 [16].
6.1.4 Connectivity Access Network
As described in TS 24.525 [3], NGCN sites may be connected to any IP-CAN valid
for TISPAN NGN. The present document assumes the following types of IP-CANs:
xDSL and Ethernet LAN although it may be applicable to other types of IP-CANs.
Clause 9.2.1 of TS 24.229 [12] and TS 24.525 [3] subclause 7.1.1 specify
methods for getting a P-CSCF SIP server domain name or IP address:
\- P-CSCF SIP server domain name or IP address is received from the NASS (e.
the NACF representing a DHCP server). In this case the P-CSCF address/port are
found in DHCP Option 120 (for xDSL access).
\- P-CSCF address provisioned through an O&M interface.
\- P-CSCF SIP server domain name or IP address received using the TR-69 [95]
CWMP. In this case the P‑CSCF address/port are found in the ProxyServer
(ProxyServerPort) field or the OuboundProxy (OutboundProxyPort) field defined
in TR-104 [96].
Additionally, subclause 9.2.1. and related access technology specific annexes
of TS 24.229 [12] specify methods of obtaining the P-CSCF address for all
access technologies.
## 6.2 Control plane interconnection
### 6.2.1 SIP procedures
#### 6.2.1.1 Outgoing requests from NGCN site
##### 6.2.1.1.1 General
Procedures for outgoing requests are specified in TS 24.525 [3], subclause
6.1.4. The following subclauses provide further guidance on the expected NGCN
site behaviour for the subscription based case in addition to subclause
5.2.1.1.
##### 6.2.1.1.2 Calling and connected identifiers
Clause 5.2.1.1.2 applies with the addition that a calling party identity may
be sent in a P-Preferred-Identity instead of a P-Asserted-Identity header
field in accordance with RFC 3325 [29].
NOTE: If the NGN does not trust the NGCN site it will generate its own
P-Asserted-Identity header field, which may take an NGCN-provided P-Asserted-
Identity or P-Preferred-Identity into account or may be a default identity for
the NGCN site. NGN will use a provided PAI or PPI if that matches one of the
registered public user identities.
##### 6.2.1.1.3 Privacy
See subclause 5.2.1.1.3.
In addition, a Privacy:id header field can also accompany a P-Preferred-
Identity header field sent by the NGCN site.
##### 6.2.1.1.4 Called identifier
See subclause 5.2.1.1.4.
##### 6.2.1.1.5 SDP offer
NOTE: TS 24.229 [12] currently requires a UE to include an SDP offer when
submitting an INVITE request. There is an issue with subscription-based
business trunking if in certain situations the NGCN site is unable to include
an SDP offer in the INVITE request.
#### 6.2.1.2 Incoming requests to NGCN site
##### 6.2.1.2.1 General
Procedures for incoming requests are specified in TS 24.525 [3], subclause
6.1.5. The following subclauses provide further guidance on the expected NGCN
site behaviour for the subscription based case in addition to 5.2.1.2.
##### 6.2.1.2.2 Calling identity
See subclause 5.2.1.2.2.
##### 6.2.1.2.3 Called identity
See subclause 5.2.1.2.3.
##### 6.2.1.2.4 Request-URI
As specified in TS 24.525 [3], if a loose-route indicator is configured for
the NGCN site the Request-URI of a SIP request received from the NGN will
convey the actual destination inside the NGCN (as specified in subclause
5.2.1.2.4), and the Route header field will contain the registered contact of
the NGCN site.
If no loose-route indicator is configured in the NGCN site profile the
Request-URI of a SIP request received from the NGN will contain the registered
contact of the NGCN site, and the public user identity of the actual
destination inside the NGCN is conveyed in the P-Called-Party-ID header field.
NOTE: The non-loose-route procedure may not be adequate for NGCN URIs that are
not assigned public user identities, e.g. private GRUUs. This issue requires
further study.
#### 6.2.1.3 Registration
In the subscription based mode the NGCN site will register to the NGN as
described in TS 24.525 [3] subclause 6.1.3, using a public user identity and a
private user identity that represent the NGCN site as a whole. As specified in
TS 24.229 [12] for UE's, the NGCN site includes a Supported:path header field
in the REGISTER request.
When using SIP Digest, in addition to the procedures specified in RFC3261, the
initial REGISTER includes an Authorization header field with the private user
identity, as specified in TS 24.229 [12] subclause 5.1.
NOTE 1: This procedure implicitly registers all other public user identities
assigned to the NGCN site as individual or wildcarded identities.
NOTE 2: If provisioned in the user profile associated with the NGCN site the
loose route indication will be stored by the S-CSCF at registration time.
If present in the REGISTER response the P-Associated-URI header field contains
the set of implicitly registered identities.
Successful registration will result in an association between the NGCN site
and the P-CSCF used for registration, based on mutual authentication between
NGCN site and S-CSCF. The NGCN should be prepared to receive signalling
traffic from the NGN over this association and in turn is expected to use this
association when sending signalling messages to the NGN. An association may be
a security association, a TLS session or a relationship between public user
identity and port number (see subclause 6.6.1).
As specified in TS 24.229 [12] for UE's, the NGCN site subscribes to the reg-
event package in order to get notified of status changes regarding its
registration (refer to subclause 4.4.2.4).
### 6.2.2 SIP protocol elements

### 6.2.3 SDP protocol
See subclause 5.2.3.
### 6.2.4 Control plane transport
The control plane transport of the NGCN-NGN Interconnection interface in the
subscription based approach complies with the provisions in subclause 4.2A of
TS 24.229 [12] applicable to a UE and a P‑CSCF with modifications as described
in the following subclauses.
A security gateway may exist with IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces between the NGCN
and the NGN.
NOTE: Need statement concerning behaviour when two SIP entities within an NGCN
site are both capable of registering through the P-CSCF, either on a cold or
hot standby basis or on a load sharing basis.
#### 6.2.4.1 Keep alive mechanism
TS 24.229 [12] provides two solutions to keep a connection alive depending on
the NAT traversal mechanism: When SIP outbound, as specified in annex K is
used the SIP-outbound keep-alive mechanism applies. When the hosted NAT
traversal mechanism defined in annex F is used, the keep-alive mechanism based
on short registrations or the SIP-outbound keep-alive mechanism can be used as
described in subclause F.4.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229.
NOTE: Use of alternative mechanisms (e.g. OPTIONS method) is outside the scope
of the present document.
#### 6.2.4.2 P-CSCF redundancy
Clause 6.1.4 describes several methods enabling an NGCN site to obtain the IP
address or the SIP server domain name of the P-CSCF. If a SIP server domain
name of the P-CSCF is obtained, RFC 3263 [86] procedures as specified in TS
24.229 [12], subclause E.2.2.1 can be applied to obtain from the DNS the IP
address of the P-CSCF, including backup addresses for use in case of failure
of the preferred choice.
NOTE 1: 3GPP TR 23.812 [94] may provide solutions for including load status
information in the DNS (e.g. setting the weight field in SRV records based on
the actual server load). However this will not affect the NGCN-NGN interface
but rather the DNS behaviour.
NOTE 2: Business Trunking specific redundancy mechanisms are for further study
in 3GPP TS 24.525 [3].

See subclause 5.4.
## 6.5 IP Version
See subclause 5.5.
## 6.6 Security
6.6.1 Authentication
The NGCN site can connect to the NGN using one of the following authentication
mechanisms between NGN and NGCN site as specified in TS 24.229 [12], subclause
5.1.1.5:
  * IMS AKA with IPSec;
\- SIP digest over TLS;
\- SIP digest without TLS.
NOTE: When SIP Digest is used without TLS, the NGCN site may need to provide
authentication credentials in all requests, as specified in 3GPP TS 33.203
[52] annex N, unless a check on the source address/port of the messages sent
by the NGCN site is considered sufficiently secure by the NGN.
Which of these authentication mechanisms are applicable is part of an SLA
between NGN and NGCN.
An NGCN has to support at least one of the above mechanisms and should allow
configuration of the authentication mechanism to be used if it supports more
than one. For the mechanisms TLS and IMS AKA support of the security agreement
extension of SIP is mandatory.
Irrespective of the mechanism used, the NGCN site is authenticated as a whole
as part of the registration process. If TLS or IMS AKA is in use, non-REGISTER
requests from the NGCN are implicitly authenticated by being sent within the
security context established between NGN and NGCN during registration, but
non-REGISTER requests may be challenged by the NGN if SIP Digest without TLS
is in use. Individual NGCN entities beyond the NGCN attachment point are never
subject to being challenged by the NGN.
In addition, if allowed by the SLA, implicit authentication may also be used.
This does not require any specific action from the NGCN site and relies on the
NASS bundled authentication procedure at the NGN side.
NOTE: The authentication mechanism discussed above is different from NGCN-
internal authentication mechanisms between entities inside the NGCN; refer to
draft ECMA-TR/100 [88] for more information. NGCN-specific authentication
information may traverse the NGN if exchanged between NGCN sites connected by
the NGN.
# 7 Specific guidelines for the peering-based approach
## 7.1 Reference model for interconnection
### 7.1.1 General
### 7.1.2 Functionalities performed by entities at the service layer
#### 7.1.2.1 Interconnection Border Control Function (IBCF)
According to 3GPP TS 24.525 [3], for the peering based scenario the IBCF is
the contact point for the NGCN site within the IM subsystem (IMS). The NGCN
site attaches to the IBCF at the Ic reference point.
Further definition of the IBCF is provided in 3GPP TS 23.228 [17] as modified
by ETSI ES 282 007 [42].
#### 7.1.2.2 NGCN
The NGCN site appears to the NGN like an IBCF attached to the (NGN\'s) IBCF at
the Ic reference point.
## 7.2 Control plane interconnection
### 7.2.1 SIP procedures
#### 7.2.1.1 Outgoing requests from NGCN site
Procedures for outgoing requests are specified in 3GPP TS 24.525 [3],
subsubclause 6.2.4 for the peering based case. The peering based scenario has
no further requirements in addition to 5.2.1.1.
NOTE: If the NGN does not trust the NGCN site it will remove a P-Asserted-
Identity header field provided by the NGCN site, e. the message will proceed
without a P-Asserted-Identity.
#### 7.2.1.2 Incoming requests to NGCN site
Procedures for incoming requests are specified in 3GPP TS 24.525 [3],
subsubclause 6.2.5 for the peering based case. The peering based scenario has
no further requirements in addition to 5.2.1.2.
#### 7.2.1.3 Registration
Not applicable.
### 7.2.2 SIP protocol elements
#### 7.2.2.1 General
#### 7.2.2.2 Methods
See subclause 5.2.2.2.
In addition to table 5.1, the methods listed in table 7.1 apply in the context
of the peering based scenario.
