# Introduction
Traditionally, telecommunication equipment is provided as physical equipment
with software and hardware bound together. Virtualization technologies, in
principle, can support network function software to be executed on COTS
hardware. The benefits of using virtualization technologies in
telecommunication network are:
\- **Flexibility:** Enabling services to be delivered via software on COTS
hardware makes the deployment and redeployment of network functions more
flexible and allows network functions to be scaled in and out dynamically.
\- **Time-to-Market:** Reducing the time for deployment of new services would
improve the time-to-market, thus allowing operators to better support changing
business requirements.
\- **OPEX saving:** The decoupling of hardware and software allows the
reduction of space, power and cooling requirements and hardware diversity and
makes the roll out, management and maintenance of network functions more
efficient.
\- **CAPEX saving:** The decoupling of the network function software from
purpose-built hardware allows the reuse of COTS hardware for new services and
to eliminate wasteful over-provisioning.
Virtualized Networks, like non-virtualized networks, need also to be managed.
The present document investigates how virtualized networks can be managed. It
investigates the relations of management architecture and management functions
between virtualized network, non-virtualized networks and mixed networks.
Whether the existing management architecture, management function and
management models could be maximum reused and enhanced to satisfy the
inclusion of the virtualized network management function are also studied.
# 1 Scope
The present document studies the network management of virtualized 3GPP
specified core networks based on the architectural framework in ETSI GS NFV-
MAN 001 [2]. It studies the network management of mobile networks that include
virtualized core networks functions.
It also identifies the potential impacts on the existing 3GPP management
architecture and to propose potential solutions for the network management of
fully virtualized networks and mixed networks.
The objectives of this study are:
\- Study the use cases and concepts for the network management of virtualized
networks, which are applicable to 3GPP, taking into account the relevant use
cases from ETSI.
\- Analyse and classify the network management scenarios when all instances of
3GPP-defined network elements in a subsystem/domain are virtualized according
to the architectural framework in ETSI GS NFV-MAN 001 [2] (i.e. in fully
virtualized networks).
\- Identify the requirements for potential solutions for the network
management of virtualized networks when all instances of 3GPP-defined network
elements in a subsystem/domain are virtualized according to the architectural
framework in ETSI GS NFV-MAN 001 [2] (i.e. in fully virtualized networks).
\- Analyse and classify the network management scenarios when some instances
of 3GPP-defined network elements in a subsystem/domain are virtualized
according to the architectural framework in ETSI GS NFV-MAN 001 [2] (i.e. in
mixed networks).
\- Identify the requirements for potential solutions for the network
management of virtualized networks when some instances of 3GPP-defined network
elements in a subsystem/domain are virtualized according to the architectural
framework in ETSI GS NFV-MAN 001 [2] (i.e. in mixed networks). Study whether
or not a single management system for mixed networks is required.
\- Identify the potential impacts on the existing 3GPP Management reference
model.
\- Analyse the existing 3GPP Management reference model, interfaces, protocols
and procedures to determine what can be re-used, adapted or extended and
whether new IRPs are needed for network management of virtualized networks.
\- Propose enhancements or extensions to the 3GPP Management reference model,
if an impact is foreseen.
\- If needed, solution(s) for a single management system for mixed networks
should be studied.
\- Provide recommendations for the standardization of the network management
of fully virtualized networks and mixed networks, based on the result of the
analysis and the potentially identified impacts, enhancements or extensions.

# 4 Concept and background
## 4.1 Concept
**Domain Manager (DM):** provides element management functions and domain
management functions for a sub-network which may include network elements with
virtualized network functions or non-virtualized network functions or both.
Inter-working domain managers provide multi-vendor and multi technology
network management functions.
**Element Manager (EM):** provides a package of end-user functions for
management of a set of closely related types of network elements which may
include network elements with virtualized network functions or non-virtualized
network functions or both. These functions can be divided into two main
categories: Element Management Functions and Sub-Network Management Functions.
**Network Element (NE):** a discrete telecommunications entity (e.g. the RNC),
which can be managed over a specific interface. The NE may contain virtualized
or non-virtualized network function.
**Network Manager (NM):** provides a package of end-user functions with the
responsibility for the management of a network which may include network
elements with virtualized network functions or non-virtualized network
functions or both, mainly as supported by the EM(s) but it may also involve
direct access to the Network Elements. All communication with the network is
based on open and well-standardized interfaces supporting management of multi-
vendor and multi-technology Network Elements.
## 4.2 Background
The 3GPP system may include a variety of different entities to deliver mobile
services (see e.g. Figure 7.3.3.1 of [10]). It is expected that future
implementation options for the entities of the 3GPP system include various
technologies for virtualization. Network and service providers make use of
different information in several different ways which also may vary from
network to network and from time to time. System architectures and technology
choices, as well as the availability of off-the-shelf commercial systems and
software components that fulfil the requirements established in the present
document, may be critical to an operator\'s implementation of the specified
management architecture. Large software systems, such as a network management
system, are a capital investment that operators of mobile services cannot
afford to replace every time its requirements change. Hence, entities of the
3GPP system that have been implemented with virtualization options should be
managed in the same manner as entities implemented with non-virtualization
options, to the extent possible.
The ETSI NFV ISG identified (see clause 4 of [11]) six business objectives for
NFV:
\- Rapid service innovation through software-based deployment and
operationalization of network functions and end-end services.
\- Improved operational efficiencies resulting from common automation and
operating procedures.
\- Reduced power usage achieved by migrating workloads and powering down
unused hardware.
\- Standardized and open interfaces between network functions and their
management entities so that such decoupled network elements can be provided by
different players.
\- Greater flexibility in assigning VNFs to hardware.
\- Improved capital efficiencies compared with dedicated hardware
implementations.
The NFV business objectives for flexibility, operational efficiency and rapid
service innovation requires a much more dynamic operating environment than
traditional 3GPP operating environment.
In this dynamic operating environment the performance of the management
interfaces is an important factor in delivering these business objectives. For
example, the management interface performance in creation of new instances of
3GPP entities and their provisioning for operational readiness, are
potentially significant factors in achieving the NFV business objectives.
The 3GPP defined VNFs still require some underlying hardware resources. The
NFV business objective is that VNFs are procured independently from the
hardware resources. This NFV business objective applies whether the entity has
been partially virtualized (e.g. via SDN) or completely virtualized (see
clause 6.4.2 of [12] for further discussion of partial vs complete
virtualization). In many cases, the underlying hardware resources are expected
to be administered independently from the virtualized entities required for
the 3GPP system. The ETSI NFV ISG has provided a number of use cases [11]
illustrating multiple administrations with different types of service models.
The default expectation is that the 3GPP defined VNFs would be one of
potentially multiple tenants executing on an independently administered
infrastructure.
# 5 Management use cases
## 5.1 Use cases for Fault management
### 5.1.1 Introduction
When a failure occurs in virtualized networks or mixed networks, several
alarms associated with the failure might be generated and reported to one or
more management functions (e.g. EM, VNFM or NFVO), which are defined in [2],
to allow fault corrective action to be taken. This subclause includes use
cases to show fault management flows including alarm reporting flows as
follows:
1\. An alarm generated by NE (excluding NFVI)
2\. An alarm generated by NFVI
3\. An alarm generated by EM
4\. An alarm generated by VNFC
5\. TBD
### 5.1.2 Failure management when VNF detects VNF failure
#### 5.1.2.1 Introduction
This use case is to describe the management of VNF application layer failure
detected by VNF.
#### 5.1.2.2 Actor
3GPP EM.
#### 5.1.2.3 Pre-condition
1\. EM is active.
2\. VNF has a fault.
#### 5.1.2.4 Description
1\. VNF detects the fault and sends the alarms to EM.
2\. EM may perform fault correlation. Based on the correlation analysis, the
corrective action may trigger the execution of the VNF instance lifecycle
management flows (e.g. VNF scaling) (Annex C in [2]). In case the corrective
action needs to be performed by VNFM, EM sends a corrective action request
toward VNFM.
3\. The EM may further forward the alarms to NM.
4\. NM may perform fault correlation anytime. Based on the fault correlation
analysis, NM triggers a corrective action to repair the application layer
failure. The corrective action may trigger the execution of the VNF instance
lifecycle management flows (e.g. VNF scaling) or the Network Service instance
lifecycle management flows. In case the corrective action needs to be
performed by NFVO, NM sends a corrective action request toward NFVO.
5\. Event representing VNF recovery is sent to NM because operator wants to
know the change which is dynamically performed.
#### 5.1.2.5 Post-condition
The network operation works normally. The operator knows the recovery from the
VNF failure.
### 5.1.3 Failure management when the alarm is generated by NFVI
#### 5.1.3.1 Introduction
This use case describes the failure management when the failure is generated
by NFVI. The NFVI failure is processed by the VIM, and as a result the VIM
exposes virtualized resource (VR) failure(s).
#### 5.1.3.2 Actor
ETSI MANO VNFM.
#### 5.1.3.3 Pre-condition
The VNF is active.
The VNF has detected an application failure and have reported it to EM.
The NFVI has detected a failure (e.g. compute, storage and networking related
faults) and reported it to VIM.
#### 5.1.3.4 Description
1\. VIM sends VR failure reports to VNFM providing information about the
possible cause of the failure (see step 1, in clause B.6 [1].
2\. VNFM identifies the VNF(s)/VNFC(s) affected by the VR failure. VNFM
reports the failure to the EM(s) that manage the affected VNFs (see steps 2 to
3, in clause B.6 [1]).
3\. EM may correlate VNF's VR failure reports from VNFM with VNF application
failure reports from VNF. EM may request VNFM to initiate the healing process.
EM may send the correlated or non-correlated failure reports to NM.
4\. NM may initiate healing process if needed.
#### 5.1.3.5 Post-condition
None.
### 5.1.4 Failure management when the EM detects VNF failure
#### 5.1.4.1 Introduction
This use case is to describe the management of VNF application layer failure
detected by EM.
#### 5.1.4.2 Actor
3GPP NM and ETSI MANO NFVO.
#### 5.1.4.3 Pre-condition
1\. EM is active.
2\. The VNF has a fault.
#### 5.1.4.4 Description
1\. EM detected the VNF fault.
2\. Same steps as stated in 2 to 5 in clause 5.1.2.4.
#### 5.1.4.5 Post-condition
The network operation works normally. The operator knows the recovery from the
VNF failure.
### 5.1.5 Failure management when the alarm is generated by VNFC
#### 5.1.5.1 Introduction
A VNF can be composed of a single or multiple VNF component(s) (VNFC). A VNFC
is an internal component of a VNF providing a sub-set of that VNF\'s
functionality defined by a VNF Provider, with the main characteristic that a
single instance of this component maps one-to-one to a single virtualisation
container [7]. A virtualisation container is a partition of a compute node
that provides an isolated virtualized computation environment. An example of a
virtualization container is a virtual machine (VM).
A single VNFC can fail due to diverse reasons. Possible failures can be
related to virtualization aspects (e.g., configuration of VNF deployment
specific parameters, interaction of a VNFC with another VNFC, etc.). Such
failures can affect the overall VNF and need to be reported to trigger the
automatic or on-demand healing of the VNF.
This use case exemplifies the failure management when the alarm is generated
by the VNFC and the fault information is in the first instance sent to the
VNFM (refer to clause 11.2 in [8] and step 4.2 in clause B.6 in [2] for
examples). Refer to clause 5.1.4 in the present document for another option.
Note: The fault information producer, i.e., VNF or EM, is to be determined.
The following sub-clauses describe the use case where VNF provides such fault
information.
#### 5.1.5.2 Actor
ETSI MANO VNFM.
#### 5.1.5.3 Pre-condition
The NFV management and orchestration (ETSI MANO) operation is active.
The 3GPP management operation is active.
The VNF is instantiated, configured (both deployment and application) and
running.
The VNF may have detected an application failure and be already reported to
EM.
#### 5.1.5.4 Description
The following steps are executed:
1\. The VNFC detects a failure, e.g., concerning its own virtualization
context (e.g. configuration of VNF deployment specific parameters), the own
VNF deployment (e.g. interaction of a VNFC with another VNFC).
2\. The VNF notifies the VNFM about the VNFC failure.
3\. The VNFM can correlate the VNFC failure with other virtualized resources
failures received [2].
4\. In the case that the corrective action needs to be performed by the VNFM
and the auto-healing is enabled, the VNFM can execute automatically the
healing process notifying to the EM about the start and completion of the
healing operation [2]. If the auto-healing is not enabled or the healing
operation is not successful, the VNFM sends a notification of VNF failure to
the EM.
5\. Same steps as stated in 2 to 5 in clause 5.1.2.4.
#### 5.1.5.5 Post-condition
If the VNF has self-healed, the network operation works normally, the operator
knows the recovery from the VNF failure. If not, the operator knows about the
VNF failure.
### 5.1.6 Notification of VNFCs impacted due to scheduled NFVI maintenance
#### 5.1.6.1 Introduction
The virtualization of the network function decouples the hardware from the
software using virtualization technologies. Thus, the VNF makes use of
virtualized resources.
The virtualized resources can be impacted, not only because of failures from
the underlying hardware resources, but also because of possible scheduled
maintenance of them. For instance, a scheduled update of the hypervisor
software or the firmware of a physical machine (host) will likely impact the
virtualized resources on top and consequently the execution of the VNF.
As a result, there is a need for notifying about VNF and any of its
components, if they will be impacted due to maintenance of NFVI elements. Such
notification is sent in advance to the actual maintenance. This is needed by
the operator and management systems in order to act accordingly and minimize
the impact and disruption of the VNF. This case is especially relevant when
the network operator has different teams devoted to manage the 3GPP mobile
network and the NFV infrastructure.
#### 5.1.6.2 Actor
ETSI MANO VNFM.
#### 5.1.6.3 Pre-condition
The NFV management and orchestration (ETSI MANO) operation is active.
The 3GPP management operation is active.
The VNF is running on top of NFVI.
#### 5.1.6.4 Description
The following steps are executed:
1\. ETSI MANO functional blocks process internally the notification of
maintenance of an NFVI element (e.g. a physical machine), mapping such element
to the virtualized resources (e.g. VM) that will be impacted due to such
maintenance. In this process, the VNFM that manages the VNF whose virtualized
resources are to be impacted is notified [2].
2\. The VNFM, if enabled and authorized, can try to mitigate the impact on the
VNF. If the VNF will be impacted, the VNFM notifies the EM about the VNF and
any of its components whose virtualized resources will be impacted due to
maintenance of one or more than one NFVI element, identifying the cause (i.e.
due to maintenance), the VNF and the components that are affected and the
associated VIM.
3\. The EM can further forward such notification to the NM.
#### 5.1.6.5 Post-condition
The Operator and the 3GPP management system know about the maintenance status
and further actions can be executed according to other management flows (e.g.
change VNF configuration, migration of VNF components, request delaying the
maintenance, etc.).
### 5.1.7 VM failure is detected by VNF application
#### 5.1.7.1 Introduction
This UC describes the expected VNF alarm reporting behaviour in case the VNF
detects an alarm condition that is caused by the supporting VM (and not caused
by its own VNF programming logic). Support of this UC does not imply a
decision on the support of the following:
\- All VNFs should be capable of detecting VM failure;
\- All NFVIs should or should not report NFVI failure to VIM;
\- All VIMs should or should not detect NFVI failure.
This UC covers failure management cases which are detectable by VNF
applications. The following failure case is out of scope of this UC:
  * All VMs used by the VNF completely crash. It causes failure of all VNF functionalities.
#### 5.1.7.2 Actor
3GPP EM.
#### 5.1.7.3 Pre-condition
VNF is active.
#### 5.1.7.4 Description
1\. A VM service request failure occurs.
2\. VNF application determines that the VM service request failure is not
caused by the VNF application programming logic:
a) Sends the alarm indicating VM service request failure to EM; or
b) If the VM service request failure causes a VNF application failure, sends
an alarm indicating VNF application failure with probable cause indicating VM
service request failure to EM.
3\. EM forwards alarm information to NM/OSS according to step 6.1 of clause
B.6 of [2].
4\. EM can trigger a corrective action request towards VNFM according to step
6.2 of clause B.6 of [2].
#### 5.1.7.5 Post-condition
None.
### 5.1.8 VNF snapshot capture
#### 5.1.8.1 Introduction
By virtualizing a network function, capturing snapshots of the VNF and its
components is possible. Together with other logging information, these
snapshots can be used for multiple purposes, e.g. troubleshooting, rollback
during erroneous VNF lifecycle management events or software upgrade, for fast
VNF re-deployment, etc. A VNF snapshot can potentially contain one or several
virtual machine snapshots, which in turn capture the state of the virtual
machine configuration, the virtual disk and possibly memory dumps.
There is the possibility that capturing VNF and component snapshots can be
executed automatically by the VNFM, or be triggered manually on-demand by the
operator. In the manual case, the operator decides that a VNF or any of its
components needs to be captured.
#### 5.1.8.2 Actor
3GPP EM and ETSI MANO VNFM.
#### 5.1.8.3 Pre-condition
The NFV management and orchestration (ETSI MANO) operation is active.
The 3GPP management operation is active.
#### 5.1.8.4 Description
Two initial triggers are possible:
a) In the manual case, three initial steps are processed:
1) The operator initiates the snapshot capture of a VNF or any of its
components by operating the 3GPP functional block.
2) The EM requests to VNFM to execute the VNF lifecycle management operation
of capturing snapshot of VNF or any of its components.
3) The VNFM (ETSI MANO functional block) processes the request in the manual
case.
b) In the automatic case, the following step is processed:
1) The VNFM (ETSI MANO functional block) internally determines that capture of
VNF or any of its components is necessary.
The following steps are executed both in the manual and automatic case:
1) ETSI MANO functional blocks proceed with the capture of the VNF\'s virtual
machine snapshots [2].
2) The VNFM notifies to the EM with the information about the VIM and file
paths to the snapshots.
3) The EM can dump additional information (e.g. current configuration) and
forwards to the NM such information together with the rest of information
received from the VNFM.
#### 5.1.8.5 Post-condition
The operator has the information about where the snapshots and corresponding
logs have been stored.
## 5.2 Use cases for Configuration Management
### 5.2.1 VNF instantiation and configuration for mixed network
#### 5.2.1.1 Introduction
This use case is intended to show how a VNF is instantiated in the mixed
networks where PNF and VNF co-exist. That is a common scenario before NFV is
fully deployed.
#### 5.2.1.2 Actor
3GPP EM (request originated by itself or by NM) and ETSI MANO NFVO (request
originated by NM).
#### 5.2.1.3 Pre-condition
NM or EM detects that the PNF or VNF is overloaded and no VNF can be expanded
to take over the load. In this case, NM or EM determines to initiate a new VNF
instantiation.
#### 5.2.1.4 Description
1) The request to instantiate a new VNF can come from NM (see step 1, in
clause B.3.1.2 [2]), or EM (see step 1, in clause B.3.2.1 [2]).
2) NFVO may call VNFM to instantiate the VNF and request VIM to allocate the
resources required by the VNF instance (see steps 4 to 12 in clause B.3.1.2
[2]), if the request comes from NM. Otherwise, EM may call VNFM to instantiate
the VNF and request VIM to allocate the resources required by the VNF instance
(see steps 1 to 8 in B.3.2.1 [2]).
3) After the successful resources allocation by VIM, VNFM configures the VNF
with any VNF specific lifecycle parameters and notifies EM of the new VNF (see
step 13, in clause B.3.1.2 [2]).
4) EM then configures the VNF with application specific parameters (see step
14, in clause B.3.1.2 [2] and step 13, in clause B.3.2.2 [2]).
5) NFVO acknowledges the completion of the VNF instantiation to NM after VNFM
acknowledges the completion of the VNF instantiation (see steps 15 to 16, in
clause B.3.1.2 [2]).
#### 5.2.1.5 Post-condition
A new VNF is instantiated to mitigate the overloaded PNF or VNF.
### 5.2.2 NFV configuration management
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
3GPP Configuration Management (CM) has the system modification functions and
system monitoring functions (as described in [4]). It can support the
operations of NE creation/deletion/conditioning and the other operations of
information request/report or report control. NE can be configured into
service or out of service and the NM can get the object creation/deletion and
object attribute value change or state change notifications of NE.
NFV configuration management includes the configuration of VNF application
specific parameters (3GPP mobile service related) and the configuration of VNF
deployment specific parameters (non-3GPP mobile service related).
From 3GPP perspective, NE object and configuration parameters (e.g.
identification, port, neighbour relation) are modelled as the Information
Object Class attributes of CM. An example of IOC would be the MMEFunction
defined in [5]. ETSI NFV MANO refers to IOC attributes as VNF application
specific parameters.
The decoupling of software and hardware in NFV scenario gives rise to the need
to model VNF deployment specific parameters in a way that is applicable to all
SDO\'s defined nodes. And VNF application specific parameters may need to be
changed or enhanced by 3GPP.
Also, after the VNF deployment specific parameters or VNF application specific
parameters are changed by VNFM or EM, EM should notify NM the necessary
parameter change using CM capabilities (as described in [4]).
#### 5.2.2.2 Actor
3GPP EM, ETSI MANO NFVO (request originated by 3GPP NM).
#### 5.2.2.3 Pre-condition
Based on the operator\'s specified policy, the configuration management of VNF
is triggered (e.g. scale out operation). EM or VNFM received the indication of
VNF operation.
Before implementing the VNF operation, EM or VNFM may perform pre-operation
activities (e.g. reconfiguring of nodes that are neighbour to the to-be-
affected VNF).
#### 5.2.2.4 Description
1\. EM sends the VNF lifecycle management request to VNFM (e.g. scale VNF, as
described in [2], clause 7.2.4).
Or
1\'. NM sends the configuration request to NFVO and NFVO interprets it into a
specific VNF lifecycle management request and sends the request to VNFM.
Note 1: Some VNF lifecycle management operations (as described in [2], clause
7.2.4.2), which are Query VNF and Check VNF instantiation feasibility, may not
be applicable in this use case.
2\. VNFM receives this request then implements the corresponding operation to
the VNF and completes configuration of VNF deployment specific parameters.
3\. After the VNF deployment specific parameters are configured by VNFM, VNF
is created, terminated or updated and the resource of the VNF is changed.
4\. After the completion of the configuration, VNFM returns the success
response to EM with necessary VNF change notification (as described in [2],
clause 7.2.5).
5\. EM performs post-operation activities (e.g. adjusting neighbour nodes of
the affected VNF, configuring the VNF with application specific parameters).
6\. EM notifies NM of all needed VNF resource changes through CM capabilities
(as described in [4]).
Note 2: Whether the CM capabilities need to be enhanced is FFS. The hardware
change information may not be needed and they may be replaced by Virtual
Machine (VM) information.
Note 3: In order to manage the VNF network resource (as in NRM), the VNF
application specific parameters, the VNF deployment specific parameters and
the physical device parameters are specified or needed to be specified. 3GPP
will study whether the VNF application specific parameters of the 3GPP-defined
nodes should be changed or enhanced.
#### 5.2.2.5 Post-condition
The configured VNF can be managed by NM/EM and the all affected nodes are
operational.
### 5.2.3 VNF configuration management by EM in mixed network
#### 5.2.3.1 Introduction
The VNF application specific configuration management is needed during the
lifecycle of VNF. In mixed network, the VNF application specific configuration
management may be realized by EM and it may include:
1\. Configure the VNF application specific parameters after a VNF is
instantiated;
2\. Release logical resource (e.g. managed objects, data structures) dedicated
to manage the terminated VNF;
3\. Configure the VNF application specific parameters after a VNF is scaled,
upgraded or updated.
Note: Before VNF scale-in/scale-down/termination execution, there might be a
need for NM/EM to adjust configuration parameters of nodes neighbour to the
subject VNF.
The following use cases may be invoked by other use cases in present document
when the VNF application specific parameters need to be configured, e.g. NFV
configuration management use case in clause 5.2.2.
#### 5.2.3.2 Configure the VNF application specific parameters after a VNF is
instantiated
##### 5.2.3.2.1 Introduction
After the VNF is instantiated, the VNF is in the Instantiated Not Configured
state [6]. The VNF application specific parameters should be configured.
##### 5.2.3.2.2 Actor
ETSI MANO VNFM, 3GPP NM (request originated by NFVO or EM).
##### 5.2.3.2.3 Pre-condition
1\. EM receives the VNF has been instantiated message from VNFM; or
2\. NM receives the VNF has been instantiate message from NFVO; or
3\. NM receives the VNF has been instantiated message from EM.
##### 5.2.3.2.4 Description
1\. Under the pre-condition 2 or pre-condition 3, NM sends a configure VNF
application parameters message to EM.
2\. EM prepares the set of VNF application specific parameters for the newly
instantiated VNF and creates the logical resource (e.g. managed objects, data
structures) dedicated to manage the subject VNF.
3\. EM performs pre-configuration activities e.g. reconfiguring of nodes that
have relation with the subject VNF, if necessary.
4\. EM configures the subject VNF with the prepared VNF application specific
parameters (see step 12, in clause B.3.2.1 [2]).
##### 5.2.3.2.5 Post-condition

dedicated to manage the subject VNF.
##### 5.2.3.3.5 Post-condition
The logical resource (e.g. managed objects, data structures) dedicated to
manage the subject VNF is released.
#### 5.2.3.4 Configure the VNF application specific parameters after a VNF is
scaled, upgraded or updated
##### 5.2.3.4.1 Introduction
During the VNF lifecycle, VNF can be changed by some lifecycle operations,
such as scale VNF, update VNF or upgrade VNF. After these lifecycle operations
are executed, the VNF application specific parameters may also need to be
configured.
##### 5.2.3.4.2 Actor
ETSI MANO VNFM, 3GPP NM (request originated by ETSI MANO NFVO or by 3GPP EM).
##### 5.2.3.4.3 Pre-condition
1\. EM receives the VNF has been scaled message from VNFM; or
2\. NM receives the VNF has been scaled or upgraded or updated message from
NFVO; or
3\. NM receives the VNF has been scaled message from EM.
##### 5.2.3.4.4 Description
1\. Under the pre-condition 2 or pre-condition 3, NM decides whether the VNF
application specific parameters need to be configured and if needed, NM sends
a request to configure VNF application specific parameters to EM.
2\. Under the pre-condition 1, EM decides whether the VNF application specific
parameters need to be configured.
3\. If needed, EM:
\- prepares the VNF application specific parameters to be configured in the

\- reconfigures the subject VNF with the prepared application specific
parameters (see step 13, in clause B.4.4.1 and B.4.4.2 [2]).
##### 5.2.3.4.5 Post-condition
The VNF application specific parameters are updated.
### 5.2.4 Automatic re-connection of eNBs after lifecycle management of vMME
#### 5.2.4.1 Introduction
In the mixed network management, the scenario in which physical network
elements are connected to virtualized network elements should be taken into
consideration. Such scenario may occurr during a migration from the physical
NE oriented network to virtualized NE oriented one. This clause considers the
case in which non-virtualized eNBs are connected to vMMEs and includes one use
case to show automatic re-connection of eNBs after lifecycle management of
vMME.
This use case focuses on the recovery of connections between MMEs and eNBs so
re-establishment of the connections between UEs and MMEs is out of scope of
this use case.
#### 5.2.4.2 Actor
3GPP NM, 3GPP EM.
#### 5.2.4.3 Pre-condition
NFV management and orchestration operation is active. 3GPP management
operation is active.
An MME pool consists of virtualized MMEs only and all vMMEs in the pool are
active and controlled by single EM. These vMMEs do not have automatic recovery
procedure using redundant back-up system.
The physical eNBs are connected to vMMEs.
#### 5.2.4.4 Description
1\. All vMMEs of the MME pool have serious failure. The vMME failures result
in complete shutdown of the vMMEs. Then the MME pool is completely shutting
down based on the assumption described in the Pre-condition clause above.
2\. The vMME failures are reported to the EM controlling the MMEs. The EM
determines the root cause and the corrective action which is described in the
following steps.
> Note: The failure detection and reporting procedure, root cause and impact
> analysis procedure and triggering procedure of the fault resolution action
> are FFS.
3\. The EM controlling the MMEs issues sufficient number of Terminate VNF
operations (7.2 of [2]) to terminate all vMMEs of the MME pool. For each
successful response, the EM issues Instantiate VNF (7.2 of [2]) to instantiate
a new VNF instance to replace the terminated vMME.
4\. The EM controlling MME configures the newly instantiated VNFs for vMMEs.
5\. The EM controlling MME notifies NM of vMME\'s re-instantiation.
Note: The following steps are needed in case an involvement of the EM
controlling eNB is necessary for re-establishment of eNB-MME connection. In
some cases (e.g. all the newly created vMMEs of the failed MME pool have
identical GUMMEI to all those failure vMMEs, or only DNS involvement is needed
for re-establishment), EM needs not reconfigure any eNBs.
6\. NM notifies the EM controlling eNB of vMME\'s re-instantiation event.
7\. The EM controlling eNB adjusts and reconfigures the affected eNBs, if
required, e.g. so that the affected eNBs will connect to the newly
instantiated and configured vMMEs.
8\. The EM controlling eNB notifies NM of changes of eNBs\' configuration.
#### 5.2.4.5 Post-condition
The eNBs have been successfully reconnected and are in operation.

#### 5.3.2.3 Pre-condition
NFV management and orchestration operation is active, and 3GPP management
operation is active.

#### 5.3.2.4 Description
  1. VIM collects the performance data from NFVI. VIM reports the VR PM data to the correct VNFM managing the subject VNF/VNFC that consumes the VRs.
  2. VNFM identifies VNF/VNFC that consumes the VRs related to the received VR PM data, and forwards the received VR PM data to EM.
  3. EM maps the VNFC VR PMs to VNF level PMs and forwards the VNF PM data to NM.
> Note: The requirement that NM needs VR PM data is TBD.
#### 5.3.2.4 Post-condition

resources, it should request VIM to provide the information about the
currently available resource.
3\. Based on the statistic of the collected information about available
resources, NM checks whether the currently available resources are sufficient
for the expansion and if they are sufficient, NM can make a decision to
initiate the expansion of virtualized network functions or network services
(the expansion related use cases are described in clauses 5.2, 5.3 and 5.6).
#### 5.4.2.5 Post-condition

### 5.5.14 Network Service instance scaling
#### 5.5.14.1 Introduction
Network Service scale out/in are important operations during the management of
Network Services. They may be triggered at NM by operator manually or by some
NM level functions (e.g. Load Balancing) automatically.
These UCs are to show the Network Service scale out/in operations once the
needs are detected and the scaling actions are determined.
#### 5.5.14.2 Network Service instance scale out

### 5.5.15 Network Service instance update due to VNF instance modification
#### 5.5.15.1 Introduction
Network Service update due to VNF instance modification is an important
operation during the management of Network Services. It may be triggered at NM
by operator manually or by some NM level functions (e.g. Self-healing)
automatically.
This use case is to show the Network Service update due to VNF instance
modification operation once the need is detected and the update action is
determined.
#### 5.5.15.2 Actor
3GPP NM.
#### 5.5.15.3 Pre-condition
NFV management and orchestration operation is active and 3GPP management
operation is active.
NM detected the need to update a NS instance and have determined the update
action.

to the VNF instance modification.
### 5.5.16 Termination of Core Network Service Instance
#### 5.5.16.1 Introduction
The use case is intended to describe the termination of a core NS (instance).
Multiple VNFs may need to be terminated in order to complete the core NS
instance termination. The use case addresses the scenario whereby the
termination of the core NS instance is initiated at NM, triggered by the
operator. Note that the Use Case considers termination of core NS instances
for both NS instances realized through a) mix network functions (i.e.
virtualized network functions and physical network functions) and b)
virtualized network functions only.
This use case addresses only the termination of an instance of a particular
core NS previously instantiated using a relevant deployment template.
#### 5.5.16.2 Actor
3GPP NM.
#### 5.5.16.3 Pre-condition
The core NS exists and the 3GPP functional block is authorized to terminate
the core NS instance.
The operator decides that a particular core NS instance is not required
anymore and therefore the operator decides to terminate that particular core
NS instance. For example the demand for a particular core NS instance has
decreased to a point where its maintenance (continued offering) is no longer
justifiable.
#### 5.5.16.4 Description
1\. The operator triggers a particular core NS instance termination.
2\. Based on the deployment template of the core NS instance targeted
(requested by operator) for termination, NM may initiate termination of
application level connections among VNFs/PNFs that are used by the targeted
core NS instance. An example of application level connections that may be
released during the termination of the core NS instance, could be the release
of Data Radio Bearers as specified in [9] clause 8.2.3.2.1.
Note 1: NM should not terminate application level connections that are also
used by other core NS instance(s) not targeted for termination.
3\. NM initiates termination of the NS instance related to the targeted core
NS instance toward NFVO, which may include termination of VLs [2] clause 6.4
and/or FGs [2] clause 6.5 set up by the ETSI MANO functional block in
accordance to the procedure described in [2] clause C.6.. This step is not
addressed further in this Use Case.
Note 2: NM should not initiate termination of the NS instance if the NS
instance is also used by other core NS instances not targeted for termination.
4\. Once the 3GPP functional block receives a positive response from the ETSI
MANO functional block (i.e. acknowledgement that the NS instance termination
is completed), the result of the NS instance termination is communicated by
the 3GPP functional block to the operator.
#### 5.5.16.5 Post-condition
The Network Service Instance is terminated.
Some relevant connections (i.e. application level, VLs and FGs) among
VNFs/PNFs used by the core NS instance targeted for termination and not used
by other NS instances may have been terminated.
Some relevant VNFs used by the core NS instance targeted for termination and
not used by other NS instances may have been terminated and their related
resources may have been released.
The operator is notified with the result of the termination.
### 5.5.17 VNF expansion
#### 5.5.17.1 Introduction
VNF expansion refers to the addition of capacity that is deployed for a VNF
and may result in a scale-out of a VNF by adding VNFCs to support more
capacity or may result in a scale-up of virtualized resources in existing
VNF/VNFCs (see clauses B.4.4.1 and B.4.4.2 in [2]).
This UC is to show the VNF expansion operations once the need is detected and
the scaling action is determined.
#### 5.5.17.2 Actor
3GPP EM (request originated by self or by NM or by NFVO via NM).
#### 5.5.17.3 Pre-condition
NM or EM detected the need to scale and have determined the scaling action.
#### 5.5.17.4 Description
1\. EM, or NM (via EM or NFVO) requests capacity expansion to the VNFM (see
step 2, in clause B.4.4.2 in [2]).
2\. VNFM notifies to the subscribed functional blocks (e.g., EM, NFVO) for
lifecycle change notifications about initiating the scaling procedure.
Note: [2] does not contain information of such notification.
3\. VNFM expands the resources (see steps 8 to 10 in B.4.4.1 and B.4.4.2 in
[2]).
4\. After successful resource expansion, VNFM sends EM the information that an
existing VNF has additional capacity (see step 11 in clauses B.4.4.1 and
B.4.4.2 in [2]).
5\. EM updates the VNF as a managed device (see step 12, in both clauses
B.4.4.1 and B.4.4.2 in [2]).
6\. EM configures the VNF with application specific parameters (see step 13,
in both clause B.4.4.1 and B.4.4.2 in [2]).
7\. EM sends information about the newly updated and configured additional
capacity to the NM.
#### 5.5.17.5 Post-condition
VNF is in operational with expanded capacity.
### 5.5.18 VNF Contraction
#### 5.5.18.1 Introduction
VNF contraction refers to the removal of capacity from a deployed VNF and may
result in scale-in of a VNF by removing VNFCs to free resources in the NFVI,
or may result in scale-down of computing and memory resource from existing
VNF/VNFCs (see clauses B.4.4.3, B.4.4.4 in [2]).
The goal is to show how VNF contraction operation can reduce capacity in NFVI,
when NM or EM detects the capacity release opportunity.
#### 5.5.18.2 Actor
3GPP EM (request originated by self or by NM or by NFVO via NM).
#### 5.5.18.3 Pre-condition
NM or EM detects a capacity release opportunity and determines to trigger the
VNF contraction.
#### 5.5.18.4 Description
1\. After NM, via EM, adjusts the configuration of the subject VNF and the
nodes neighbour to the subject VNF if needed:
\- EM, or NM via EM requests capacity release for the VNF to the VNFM (see
steps 2 to 5, in clause B.4.4.4 [2]) or
\- NM via NFVO requests VNFM to initiate VNF contraction.
2\. VNFM notifies to the subscribed functional blocks (e.g., EM, NFVO) for
lifecycle change notifications about initiating the scaling procedure.
Note: [2] does not contain information of such notification.
3\. VNFM starts the process to terminate a VNF component (see step 6, in
clauses B.4.4.3, B.4.4.4 [2]).
4\. Once the VNF component is gracefully terminated, the VNFM requests VIM
directly to delete of the VM(s) (see step 7, in clauses B.4.4.3, B.4.4.4 [2]).
5\. After VIM acknowledging the successful resources release, VNFM notifies EM
that an existing VNF has been updated with requested capacity reduction (see
steps 8, 10 in clauses B.4.4.3, B.4.4.4 [2]).
6\. EM and VNFM update the VNF managed device (see step 12 in clauses B.4.4.3
[2], B.4.4.4 [2]).
7\. EM sends information about the VNF with reduced capacity to NM.
#### 5.5.18.5 Post-condition
VNF is in operational with reduced capacity.
### 5.5.19 Termination of Core VNF instance
#### 5.5.19.1 Introduction
The use case is intended to show how VNF is terminated in the mixed networks
where non-virtualized NE and VNF are co-existing. The use case addresses the
scenario that the VNF termination is triggered at NM by the operator.
#### 5.5.19.2 Actor
This use case contains multiple sub use cases where each sub use case has its
own actors that can be different than the actors of other sub use cases. The
actors of sub use cases are not listed.
#### 5.5.19.3 Pre-condition
Operator decides a core VNF instance is not necessary any more. For example,
operator may want to reduce the network capacity when the load of the network
is continuously low and the network resources are not efficiently utilized.
#### 5.5.19.4 Description
1\. Operator initiates the VNF instance termination operation from the 3GPP
functional block.
2\. The 3GPP functional block triggers application level termination. The
influence of termination to the provided network service should be minimized.
3\. After the application level termination is done, **the selected core VNF
instance related virtual resources are released by the ETSI MANO** functional
block**.**
4\. The result of the VNF instance termination is reported to the operator.
#### 5.5.19.5 Post-condition
All VNF components of the selected VNF instance have been terminated, the
related virtual resources (e.g. computing, storage, network and connectivity,
etc.) have been released accordingly after the termination. Operator is
notified with the result of the termination.
### 5.5.20 Notifications for VNF auto-scaling executed by VNFM
#### 5.5.20.1 Introduction
Auto-scaling refers to the automatic procedure controlled and executed by the
VNFM to scale the capacity of a VNF (refer to clause B.4.1 in [2]). To execute
such auto-scaling procedure, the VNFM does not need to request for an explicit
granting of the operation to the EM, as long as it has been authorized to do
so, e.g. through specific policies. However, it should be noted, that
internally in ETSI NFV MANO, granting for resource provisioning or other
procedures can still be performed, but these are outside of the scope of the
current use case.
This use case illustrates the need for notifications to be sent by the VNFM to
the EM with regards to auto-scaling procedure. Such notifications are useful
for the EM, for instance, to assess any impact and needed reconfiguration of
the managed VNF or other network functions.
Note: This use case will be re-examined after 3GPP SA5 has resolution of
scaling request conflicts.
#### 5.5.20.2 Actor
3GPP EM.
#### 5.5.20.3 Pre-condition
The NFV management and orchestration (ETSI NFV MANO) operation is active.
The 3GPP management operation is active.
The VNFM has been granted to execute VNF auto-scaling.
There is no ongoing scaling procedure initiated by the EM and the EM does not
perform any on-demand scaling request during the auto-scaling procedure.
#### 5.5.20.4 Description
The following steps are executed:
  1. The VNFM (ETSI MANO functional block) internally determines that > auto-scaling of a VNF or any of VNF\'s components is necessary.
  2. The VNFM sends a notification to the EM about initiating the > auto-scaling procedure.
Note 1: [2] does not contain information of such notification.
  1. ETSI MANO functional blocks proceed with the auto-scaling procedure. > This can involve diverse interactions between ESTI MANO functional > blocks to allocate/release virtualized resources or scaling > existing virtualized resources (see clause 7.3.3.2 in [2]).
  2. In the case the auto-scaling finishes satisfactorily, the VNFM sends > a notification to the EM about the successful execution of the VNF > scaling (refer to clause 7.2.5 and clause B.4.4.1 in [2]). In > the case that failures occur during the auto-scaling procedure, > the VNFM sends notifications to the EM about the corresponding > errors.
Note 2: [2] does not contain information of the auto-scaling error
notifications.
#### 5.5.20.5 Post-condition
EM has the information about the initiation of VNF auto-scaling and whether
the VNF auto-scaling execution including any of VNF\'s components is finished
and if it was successful or faulty. With this information, the EM can perform
VNF configuration or network adjustment, if required.

# 7 Potential solutions
## 7.1 Management architecture
### 7.1.1 Overview
Figure 7.1-1 illustrates the 3GPP management architecture which manages both
virtualized and non-virtualized network functions and clarifies the
relationship between 3GPP management framework and NFV-MANO framework. The NM
and EM in figure 7.1-1 are both logical functions.
The following diagram does not imply extending the scope of 3GPP NFV study.
Figure 7.1-1: The mixed network management mapping relationship between 3GPP
and NFV-MANO architectural framework
Note 1: The network management role of OSS/BSS in ETSI NFV GSs is played by NM
in 3GPP SA5.
Note 2: The relationship/impact of the interface between EM and VNFM with/on
the 3GPP management reference model needs further discussion. Further
specification and clarifications from ETSI NFV will be taken in consideration.
Note 3: The dash boxes of PNFs are optional for some specific virtualized
network use cases.
Note 4: How to involve the MANO framework into the 3GPP management reference
model is FFS.
### 7.1.2 Involvement of 3GPP SA5 for NFV Management and Orchestration
interfaces
Table 7.1.2-1 shows the possible functional areas which SA5 can contribute to
the NFV management and orchestration standardization. However, it should be
noticed that this list is not exclusive.

### 7.2.1 Global view of data flows
#### 7.2.1.1 FM & PM data flows
##### 7.2.1.1.1 MANO GS defined FM & PM data flows
The figure 7.2.1.1.1-1 below captures the FM data flows described in [2].
These flows are for a virtualized network. The flows are for virtualized
resources, VNF and NS.
Figure 7.2.1.1.1-1: MANO GS defined data FM flows
Flow-1 VNF reports application level FM data to VNFM
Flow-2a VNFM relays application level VNF FM data to NFVO
Flow-2b VNFM relays resources FM data (mapped to VNF) to NFVO
Flow-3 VIM reports resources FM data to VNFM
Flow-4 VNFM relays resources FM data (mapped to VNF, correlated or not-
correlated) to EM
Flow-5 VIM reports resources FM data to NFVO
Flow-6a NFVO provides NS application level FM data to OSS/BSS (based on VNF FM
received via flow 2a)
Flow-6b NFVO provides resources FM data (based on VNF resources FM received
via Flow-2b or Flow-5, mapped to VNF and NS, correlated or not-correlated) to
OSS/BSS
Note 1: According to ETSI, the necessity of Flow-1 is under discussion.
Note 2: According to ETSI, the Flow-2b can carry correlated alarms regarding
VNF FM data (received via Flow-1) and VR FM data (received via Flow-3). The
use case for the Flow-2a is unclear (requires information from IFA WG).
The figure 7.2.1.1.1-2 below captures the PM data flows described in [2].
These flows are for a virtualized network. The flows are for virtualized
resources, VNF and NS.

Flow-1 VNF reports application level PM data to VNFM
Flow-2a VNFM relays VNF application level PM data to NFVO
Flow-2b VNFM relays resources PM data (mapped to VNF) to NFVO
Flow-3 VIM reports resources PM data to VNFM
Flow-4 VNFM relays resources PM data (mapped to VNF) to EM
Flow-5 VIM reports resources PM data to NFVO

Note 1: According to ETSI, the necessity of Flow-1 is under discussion. There
is a dependency of Flow-2a and Flow-6a on the existence of Flow-1.

## 7.3 Management procedures
### 7.3.1 Introduction
This clause describes the E2E management procedures regarding the management
of mobile networks that include VNFs.
A dotted-line arrow in the procedures represents a request response or a
notification. This dotted-line arrow is not a UML graphical notation.
### 7.3.2 LCM procedures
#### 7.3.2.1 Instantiation of VNF
This procedure applies to the scenario that IP address is allocated by NM or
EM/EM UI. The resources for VNF could be allocated by NFVO or VNFM.
NOTE: The IP address allocation needs FFS.
**Scenario 1: VNFM allocates VNF resources**
Main steps for this case are:
1\. VNFM receives VNF instantiation request, in which VNF IP address and the
other relevant instantiate VNF operation input parameters (see clause 6.7 [2])
are included. There are three options for this step:
1) Option 1: VNFM receives request from NFVO. NM initiates VNF instantiation
and sends a request to NFVO, which forwards to VNFM. The IP address is
allocated by NM. Refer to steps 1a.1-1a.2 in Figure 7.3.2.1-1.
2) Option 2: VNFM receives request from EM/EM UI. NM initiates VNF
instantiation and sends a request to EM, which forwards to VNFM. The IP
address is allocated by NM. Refer to steps 1b.1-1b.2 in Figure 7.3.2.1-1.
3) Option 3: VNFM receives request from EM/EM UI. EM/EM UI initiates VNF
instantiation and sends a request to VNFM. The IP address is allocated by
EM/EM UI. Refer to step 1c in Figure 7.3.2.1-1.
2\. VNFM sends Grant lifecycle operation to NFVO, which makes resource check
and reservation, then optionally sends resource information to VNFM, which
requests VIM to allocate resources (see steps 2 to 8, in clause B.3.2.1 [2]).
6\. VNFM configures VNF with deployment parameters, in which VNF IP address,
or together with EM IP address is included and also VNFM allocated VNF ID.
7\. VNFM acknowledges successful VNF instantiation back to EM, here VNFM
allocated VNF ID is included, if the VNF ID is unique within the management
realm of VNFM, then VNMF should send VNF ID together with ID of itself.
8\. EM and VNFM both add VNF as managed object.
9\. EM, using the pre-allocated VNF IP address, sends application parameters
to the VNF.
10\. VNF Manager reports successful VNF instantiation to NFVO.
11\. NFVO maps the VNF to the proper NFVI-PoP and Resource Pool.
Figure 7.3.2.1-1 VNF instantiation with resources allocated by VNFM
NOTE: Dotted rectangle area is indicated to be consistent with the agreement
in ETSI NFV.
**Scenario 2: NFVO allocates VNF resources**
1\. NFV Orchestrator receives a request from NM to instantiate a new VNF,
which includes VNF IP address, or EM IP address. The EM is the one that
manages the VNF to be instantiated.
2\. NFV Orchestrator validates the request.
3\. Optionally, NFV Orchestrator runs a feasibility check of the VNF
instantiation request to reserve resources before doing the actual
instantiation.
4\. NFVO sends a VNF instantiation to NFVM, which includes VNF IP address or
EM IP address.
5\. VNFM sends Allocate Resource request to NFVO, which together with VIM,
makes resource allocation and sends response back to VNFM (see steps 5 to 12,
in clause B.3.1.2 [2]).
6\. VNFM configures VNF with deployment parameters, which includes VNF IP, or
EM IP, or VNFM allocated VNF ID.
7\. VNFM acknowledges successful VNF instantiation back to EM, here VNF ID and
VNF IP are included, if the VNF ID is only unique within the management realm
of VNFM, then VNMF should send VNF ID together with ID of itself.
8\. The EM configures the VNF with application specific parameters.
9\. VNF Manager acknowledges the completion of the VNF instantiation back to
the NFV Orchestrator.
10\. The NFV Orchestrator acknowledges the completion of the VNF
instantiation.

#### 7.3.2.2 VNF instance scaling procedures
##### 7.3.2.2.1 VNF instance scaling procedures with resource allocation done
by VNF Manager
###### 7.3.2.2.1.1 VNF instance expansion procedure triggered by NM/EM
VNF expansion may be triggered by an automatic process or may be manually
triggered by operator intervention.
VNF expansion may include the following actions:
\- configuration changes to the VM (scale up, e.g. add CPU or memory)
\- add a new VDU instance (scale out)
The main steps for the VNF instance expansion procedure triggered by command
from NM/EM are:
1\. NM/EM/NM (via NFVO) requests capacity expansion to the VNF Manager using
the operation Scale VNF of the VNF Lifecycle Management interface, see 1(a),
1(b) and 1(c).
2\. VNFM notifies to the subscribed functional blocks (i.e., EM and NFVO in
this procedure as shown in diagram Figure 7.3.2.2-1 when they are subscribed
to the notifications) for lifecycle change notifications about the start of
the scaling operation using the VNF Lifecycle Change Notification interface.
Note: [2] does not contain information of such notification.
3\. \~ 14. The VNF Manager requests a granting to the NFVO for the VNF
expansion. VNF Manager reports successful VNF expansion to the NFVO (see step
13) and the EM (see step 11) using the VNF Lifecycle Change Notification
interface. The NFVO is aware that the new VNF configuration is instantiated in
the infrastructure. The NFVO maps the VNF to the proper VIM and resource pool.
See clause B.4.4.2 [2].
Note: \"new VNF configuration\" needs further clarification (i.e. does it
include VNF application configuration, or is it about only VNF deployment
specific configuration)
15\. EM configures the VNF with application specific parameters.
Note: In [2], this step occurs before the notification of successful VNF
expansion from the VNFM to the NFVO.
16\. EM sends information about the newly updated and configured additional
capacity to NM.

###### 7.3.2.2.1.2 VNF instance contraction procedure triggered by NM/EM
VNF contraction may be triggered by an automatic process or may be manually
triggered by operator intervention.
VNF contraction may include the following actions:
\- shut down and remove VMs (scale in)
\- release some virtualized resources from existing VMs (scale down)
The main steps for the VNF instance contraction procedure triggered by command
from NM/EM are:
1\. NM/EM/NM (via NFVO) requests capacity contraction to the VNF Manager using
the operation Scale VNF of the VNF Lifecycle Management interface, see 1(a),
1(b) and 1(c).
2\. VNFM notifies to the subscribed functional blocks (i.e., EM and NFVO in
this procedure as shown in diagram Figure 7.3.2.2-2 when they are subscribed
to the notifications) for lifecycle change notifications about the start of
the scaling operation using the VNF Lifecycle Change Notification interface.
Note: [2] does not contain information of such notification.
3\. \~ 11. The VNF Manager requests validation to the NFVO for the VNF
contraction. The NFVO grants the scale-in operation of the VNF to the VNF
Manager. VNF gracefully terminates a VNF component. VNF Manager reports
successful VNF contraction to the NFVO (see step 9) and EM (see step 10) using
the VNF Lifecycle Change Notification interface. The NFVO updates the proper
VIM and resource pool map. See clause B.4.4.4 [2].
12\. EM and VNF Manager update the VNF managed device.
13\. EM sends information about the newly updated capacity to NM.

#### 7.3.2.3 Termination of IMS/EPC VNF instance Procedure
There are the following procedures for the termination of VNF instance when
the resources are released by NFVO:
1\. Termination request is sent from NM to EM.
2\. Termination request is sent from NM to NFVO.
For Termination request is sent from NM to EM, there are following steps for
VNF instance termination:
1\. NM finds it necessary to terminate a VNF instance and sends a request to
EM.
2\. EM sends VNF instance termination request to VNFM.
3\. VNFM forwards the request to NFVO.
4\. NFVO validates the request and permits the termination of the VNF
instance. VNFM releases VNF instance according to NFVO\'s request and VIM
releases resources after receiving NFVO\'s request. (see steps 2 to 9, in
clause B.5 [2])
5\. NFVO acknowledges the completion of the VNF instance termination back to
VNFM.
6\. VNFM forwards the acknowledgement to EM.
7\. Upon receiving the request, EM deletes the corresponding Managed Object.
8\. EM sends acknowledgement to NM.

Figure 7.3.2.3-1 Termination request is sent from NM to EM
For Termination request is sent from NM directly to NFVO, there are following
steps for VNF instance termination:
1\. NM finds it necessary to terminate a VNF instance and sends a request to
NFVO.
2\. NFVO validates the request.
3\. NFVO calls VNFM to terminate of the VNF.
4\. VNFM sends terminate VNF request to EM.
5\. EM deletes the VNF from its managed device list.
6\. EM sends ACK back to VNFM.

#### 7.3.2.4 Instantiation of Network Service
The following steps are for NS instantiation procedure:
  1. NM sends a request to NFVO to instantiate a new Network Service.
  2. NFVO instantiates Network Service based on NSD. (see steps 2 to 12, in clause C.3 [2]).
> Note1: Detailed content of NSD is to be defined in ETSI IFA.
  1. NFVO acknowledges completion of the Network Service instantiation to NM.
  2. NM instructs relevant EMs to activate/turn-on VNFs/PNFs virtual port and be ready to receive and transmit.

In the present FM procedure flow, there are two categories of fault reports
that can be correlated in VNFM:
\- VR fault report
\- VNF/VNFC fault report
The procedure shows correlation at another level other than correlation done
in EM (see clause 7.3.3.1).
> Note: The producer of the VNF/VNFC fault report, i.e., VNF or EM, is to be

##### 7.3.3.2.2 VR fault report procedure
1\. The NFVI detects VR failure(s) and reports it to the VIM.
2\. When the VIM receives the failure report, it will supplement/amend the
failure related VR information, create a VR fault report, and send it to the
corresponding VNFM.
3\. The VNFM identifies which VNFs are impacted based on the VR fault report.
##### 7.3.3.2.3 VNF/VNFC fault report procedure
4\. The VNF detects failure(s) related to virtualization aspects (e.g.,
configuration of the VNF deployment specific parameters, interaction of a VNFC
with another VNFC, etc) and reports the fault to the VNFM.
##### 7.3.3.2.4 Fault correlation in VNFM
5\. Based on the VR fault report from the VIM (see step 2 in clause 7.3.3.2.2)
and the VNF/VNFC fault report (see step 4 in clause 7.3.3.2.3) from the VNF,
the VNFM performs a correlation and analysis of the reported faults and their
impact. If necessary, the VNFM triggers corrective actions.
6\. The VNFM creates a VNF virtualization related fault report and sends it to
corresponding EM.

#### 7.3.3.3 FM procedure flow for notification of VNFCs impacted due to
scheduled NFVI maintenance
The main steps for the FM procedure flow for notification of VNFCs impacted
due to scheduled NFVI maintenance are:
1\. VIM marks the status of NFVI resources that will be affected by a
maintenance procedure as maintenance.
2\. The VIM finds VRs that are affected by the maintenance status of the NFVI
resources.
3\. The VIM notifies the VNFM, whose VNF(s) are consuming the virtualized
resources, about the virtualized resources that will be affected by the
maintenance of underlying NFVI resources.
> Note 1: NFVI maintenance work may or may not maintain the serviceability of
> the VRs as expected. This UC is about the NFVI maintenance work that would
> not maintain the serviceability of the VR as expected.
>
> Note 2: The notification due to maintenance is an example of type of
> notifications that VIM should issue when it determines the serviceability of
> the virtualized resources cannot be maintained as expected.
4\. The VNFM finds the VNF and corresponding VNFC(s) whose virtualized
resources have been notified from step 3.
5\. The VNFM notifies the subscribed functional blocks (e.g., the EM and/or
NFVO) about the VNF and any of its VNFCs whose virtualied resources will be
impacted due to the maintenance of underlying NFVI resources. The VNFM
provides information about the cause (e.g., due to maintenance), and
identifies the VNF, its VNFCs, and the associated VIM.

#### 7.3.3.4 FM procedure flows for healing through operation request to VNFM
and auto-healing
##### 7.3.3.4.1 Procedure flow for VNF healing through operation request to
VNFM by EM
The main steps for the FM procedure flow for VNF healing through operation
request to VNFM by EM are:
Note: In the context of this procedure, healing refers to corrective actions
performed by the VNFM to recover the virtualization deployment of a faulty VNF
and it concerns the actions for which the VNFM is responsible, i.e.,
instantiation of VNFC, configuration of VNF deployment specific parameters,
etc.
1\. VNFM has received VR and VNF-related fault notifications. The VNFM
identifies which VNFs are impacted based on such failure reports. No VNF auto-
healing by VNFM is performed, e.g., because of unavailability of auto-healing
scripts, or because the policy for auto-healing is not active or not
applicable.
2\. VNFM creates a VNF-related virtualized resource fault report and sends it
to the corresponding EM.
3\. VNF detects the VNF application failure (e.g., virtualized resource
failures may lead to a VNF application failure) and sends a fault report to
EM.
4\. Based on failure reports from steps 2 and 3, the EM makes correlation and
analysis of impact. The EM determines the corrective action to be performed by
healing the VNF.
5\. EM requests the VNFM to execute the VNF healing, passing enough
information to determine the VNFC(s) that shall be recovered. The VNFM
acknowledges the EM the request.
6\. Start notifications of the VNF lifecycle operation (i.e., healing in this
procedure) are sent by the VNFM to subscribed functional blocks, including
e.g., EM (refer to step 6a in Figure 7.3.3.4-1) and NFVO (refer to step 6b in
Figure 7.3.3.4-1).
7\. VNFM executes the steps to terminate the impaired VNFCs, re-create the
affected VNFCs, and configure the VNF/VNFCs based on the re-deployed VNFC
instances. NFVO and VIM support this process with the necessary steps for
lifecycle operation granting and virtualized resource management.
8\. End notifications of the VNF lifecycle operation (i.e., healing in this
procedure) are sent by the VNFM to subscribed functional blocks, including,
e.g., EM (refer to step 8a in Figure 7.3.3.4-1), and NFVO (refer to step 8b in
Figure 7.3.3.4-1).

##### 7.3.3.4.2 Procedure flow for VNF auto-healing by VNFM
The main steps for the FM procedure flow for VNF auto-healing by VNFM are:
Note: In the context of this procedure, healing refers to corrective actions
performed by the VNFM to recover the virtualization deployment of a faulty VNF
and it concerns the actions for which the VNFM is responsible, i.e.,
instantiation of VNFC, configuration of VNF deployment specific parameters,
etc.
1\. VNFM has received VR and VNF-related fault notifications, and it
identifies which VNFs are impacted based on such failure reports.
2\. VNFM determines auto-healing to be executed, e.g., because of availability
of auto-healing scripts, and the auto-healing policy is active.
3\. Start notifications of the VNF lifecycle operation (i.e., healing in this
procedure) are sent by the VNFM to subscribed functional blocks, including,
e.g., EM (refer to step 3a in Figure 7.3.3.4-2), and NFVO (refer to step 3b in
Figure 7.3.3.4-2).
4\. VNFM executes the steps to terminate the impaired VNFCs and re-create the
affected VNFCs and configure the VNF/VNFCs based on the new re-deployed VNFC
instances. NFVO and VIM support this process with the necessary steps for
lifecycle operation granting and virtualized resource management.
5\. End notifications of the VNF lifecycle operation (i.e., healing in this
procedure) are sent by the VNFM to subscribed functional blocks, including,
e.g., EM (refer to step 5a in Figure 7.3.3.4-2), and NFVO (refer to step 5b in
Figure 7.3.3.4-2).

#### 7.3.3.5 VNF snapshot capture procedure
The main steps for the VNF snapshot capture procedure are:
1\. The EM requests to VNFM to execute the VNF lifecycle management operation
of capturing snapshot of VNF or any of its components.
2\. The VNFM processes the request and identifies the VNF and VNFCs for which
a snapshot is requested to be captured. The VNFM determines the order in which
the individual VNFC snapshot captures need to be performed.
> Note: The steps of the procedure within the dotted line box in Figure
> 7.3.3.5-1 are expected to be detailed and specified by ETSI ISG NFV, and
> 3GPP SA5 will leverage the solution provided by ETSI ISG NFV. The steps
> shown in the present clause are described for completeness of the end-to-end
> procedure,
3\. For each VNFC to capture a snapshot, the VNFM sends a virtualized resource
snapshot operation request to the VIM.
4\. The VIM and NFVI execute the virtualized resource snapshot, e.g., VM
snapshots using the hypervisor support.
5\. The VIM acknowledges the result of the virtualized resource snapshot
operation providing information about the filepath of the snapshot.
6\. The VNFM processes the results of the virtualized resource snapshot
operation and prepares the VNF snapshot capture result report.
7\. The VNFM acknowledges the EM the result of the VNF snapshot capture
providing information about the VIM and information to help locate the
snapshots.
8\. The EM can dump additional information (e.g., current VNF configuration).

### 7.3.4 CM procedures
#### 7.3.4.1 Adding a MME VNF to the MME pool
This procedure shows how a MME VNF can be automatically instantiated, and
added to the MME pool.
Note: The pre-condition is that the VNF package has been on-boarded.
1\. NM sends a request to NFVO to instantiate a new MME (VNF) (see step 1, in
clause B.3.1.2 [2]).
2\. NFVO requests the VNFM to instantiate the MME (VNF) instance. As part of
the internal NFV-MANO procedure, VIM processes requests to create and start
the VM(s) and relevant networking resources (see steps 2 to 12, in clause
B.3.1.2, or steps 2 to 9 in Clause B.3.2.1 [2]).
3\. VNFM sends a notification of successful MME VNF instantiation to EM (see
step 13, in clause B.3.1.2 [2]).
4\. EM works with NM to add the vMME to the MME pool by configuring the MME
VNF with application specific parameters (see step 14, in clause B.3.1.2, or
step 12 in clause B.3.2.1 [2])
5\. VNFM sends an acknowledgement of successful MME VNF instantiation to NFVO
(see step 15, in clause B.3.1.2 [2])
6\. NFVO acknowledges the completion of the VNF instantiation to NM (see step
16 in clause B.3.1.2 [2]).

#### 7.3.4.2 Removing a MME VNF from the MME pool
This procedure shows how a MME VNF instance can be terminated and removed from
the MME pool.
Note: A MME VNF has been previously instantiated.
  1. NM requests EM to decommission MME services that are provided on the VNF to be terminated.
  2. EM gracefully decommissions MME VNF services, if MME VNF is providing services.
  3. EM works with NM to remove MME VNF from the MME pool.
  4. EM acknowledges the decommissioning of MME VNF services.
  5. NM sends a request to NFVO to terminate a MME VNF (see step 1 in B.5 [2]).
  6. NFVO validates the request, terminate MME VNF instance, and release the virtualized resources (see steps 2 to 9 in B.5 [2]).
  7. NFVO acknowledges the completion of the MME VNF termination to NM (see step 10 in B.5 [2]).
> **Figure7.3.4.2-1 Removing MME VNF from the MME pool procedure**
#### 7.3.4.3 Information exchange following VNF lifecycle management
This is the procedure when configuration change is needed as a result of VNF
lifecycle management. This procedure is based on the premise that the decision
of necessary lifecycle management procedure for causal failure has already
been done.
In this procedure, there are two different EMs:
  * EM-a: EM controlling the VNF in which the lifecycle management operation occurs.
  * EM-b: EM controlling the VNF or the PNF (representing as a "NE" in the diagram) which may be affected by the VNF lifecycle management written above.
EM-a and EM-b do not have direct connection thus any information exchange
should be supported via NM except for the case that the VNF and the NE are
controlled by single EM.
The main steps for this procedure are:
  1. The lifecycle management operation for the VNF completed. This step includes a notification to the NM of the completion of lifecycle management of the VNF.
NOTE: This step corresponds to steps of VNF instantiation, update or
termination notification/ack described in B.3, B.4 and B.5 of [2]. The EM-b
does not engage in this step.
Following steps are executed based on the notification in step 1, if needed.
  1. NM identifies EM(s) which controls NE(s) affected by the VNF lifecycle management operation.
NOTE: In this procedure, EM-b is identified through this step.
  1. NM instructs EM-b to perform configuration changes invoked by the lifecycle management operation of the VNF controlled by EM-a.
  2. EM-b performs configuration change(s).
  3. EM-b may inform NM of the result of the adjustment if required.

# 8 Conclusions and recommendations
## 8.1 General Conclusions
In the study, the outcome of ETSI NFV ISG MANO has been taken into account.
The scope of the study is the management of mobile networks that include VNFs
for core nodes but excludes VNFs for RAN nodes. The mobile network being
studied can/may have all its core nodes virtualized.
Current SA5 network management standard focuses on the management of the node
functions and have minimal or non-existent standard solution to manage the
hardware supporting the node functions. The future SA5 management
specifications for mobile networks that include VNFs would include (recommend)
standard solutions to allowing the VNF\'s required hardware to be
administrated independently.
The challenge, when introducing management solutions for mobile networks that
include VNFs, is to:
a) utilize the solutions specified by the ETSI NFV project as is, and
b) reuse maximally the architecture/tools/management process that have been in
deployment for the management of node functions.
## 8.2 Conclusions on potential use cases
The following management use cases for network management involving
virtualized networks have been identified:
\- Use cases for Fault Management
1) Failure management when VNF detects VNF failure
2) Failure management when the alarm is generated by NFVI
3) Failure management when the EM detects VNF failure
4) Failure management when the alarm is generated by VNFC
5) Notification of VNFCs impacted due to scheduled NFVI maintenance
6) VM failure is detected by VNF application
7) VNF snapshot capture
\- Use cases for Configuration Management
1) VNF instantiation and configuration for mixed network
2) NFV configuration management
3) VNF configuration management by EM in mixed network
4) Automatic re-connection of eNBs after lifecycle management of vMME
\- Use cases for Performance Management
1) VNF Performance measurements reporting to EM
2) Virtualized resource performance measurements

## 8.3 Conclusions on potential requirements
The following requirements for potential solutions for management of VNF only
core network and the requirements for management of mixed core network are
identified:
\- General requirements
\- CM requirements
\- FM requirements
\- PM requirements
\- LCM requirements
## 8.4 Conclusions on potential solutions
Based on the above use cases and requirements, the potential impacts on the
existing 3GPP Management reference model are analysed and the enhancements to
the 3GPP Management reference model are proposed with considering ETSI NFV ISG
architectural framework.
Especially, the following gap analyses are identified to align the
understanding between 3GPP SA5 and ETSI ISG NFV:
\- Summary of the gap between 3GPP SA5 and ETSI NFV terms.
\- Summary of the gap with the existing 3GPP management functions.
\- Summary of the gap with the ETSI specified MANO functions.
Also, a number of ensembles, which consider different deployment scenarios for
different operators\' requirements, are studied and captured in the annex B of
the present document.
From end to end mobile network management point of view, the following
management procedures have been identified:
\- LCM procedures:
  * Instantiation of VNF
  * VNF instance scaling procedures
  * VNF instance scaling procedures with resource allocation done by VNF Manager
  * Termination of IMS/EPC VNF instance Procedure
  * Instantiation of Network Service
  * Termination of Network Service
\- FM procedures:
  * FM procedure flow for correlation done in EM
  * FM procedure flow for correlation in VNFM
  * FM procedure flow for notification of VNFCs impacted due to scheduled NFVI maintenance
  * FM procedure flows for healing through operation request to VNFM and auto-healing
  * VNF snapshot capture procedure
\- CM procedures:
  * Adding a MME VNF to the MME pool
  * Removing a MME VNF from the MME pool
  * Information exchange following VNF lifecycle management
\- PM procedures:
  * VNF performance management
Impacts on the management interfaces and models, especially FM, PM and CM
notification data flows are analysed.
The areas which need involvement of 3GPP SA5 for NFV Management and
Orchestration interfaces are identified and sent to ETSI NFV ISG by LS.
## 8.5 Recommendations
Based on the outcome of the study, normative work for the management of mobile
networks that include VNFs which can be part of EPC or IMS is needed for next
stage.
Potential areas for future normative work:
1) Concept, reference model and requirements for the management of mobile
networks that include VNFs
2) LCM for mobile networks that include VNFs
3) CM for mobile networks that include VNFs
4) FM for mobile networks that include VNFs
5) PM for mobile networks that include VNFs
6) Policy management for mobile networks that include VNFs
7) Network Resource Model, alarms types and performance measurements for the
management of mobile networks that include VNFs
Item 1 will need to be addressed first as the other items have dependency on
the progress of item 1.
SA5 work will be based on ETSI ISG NFV Group Specifications where applicable.
SA5 will coordinate with ETSI ISG NFV as necessary.
If SA5 identifies issues in ETSI ISG NFV Group Specifications, SA5 should
indicate that to ETSI ISG NFV.

# A.4 Summary of the gap with the ETSI specified MANO functions
## A.4.1 Gaps related to PM data flows
### A.4.1.1 Application level PM flow to be received by VNFM from VNF or EM
The potential purpose/motivation is unknown for VNF application level PM data
to be received by the VNFM from VNF (over Ve-Vnfm-vnf RP or indirectly via Ve-
Vnfm-ve RP, depicted as \"Flow-1\" on figure 7.2.1.1.1-2).
### A.4.1.2 Application level PM flow to be received by OSS/BSS from NFVO
The potential purpose/motivation is unknown for NS application level PM data
to be received by the OSS/BSS from NFVO (over Os-Ma-Nfvo RP, depicted as
\"Flow-6\" on figure 7.2.1.1.1-2).
### A.4.1.3 Virtualized resource level PM to be received by EM
VNFM should be able to identify the VR performance measurements related to the
managed VNFs, tag the VR performance measurements with the managed VNF
identity and send the tagged VR performance measurements to the subject EM,
via the Ve-Vnfm-em reference point (see clause 6.2.4 PM requirements).
## A.4.2 Gaps related to FM data flows
### A.4.2.1 Application level FM flow to be received by VNFM from VNF or EM
The potential purpose/motivation is unknown for VNF FM data to be received by
the VNFM from VNF (over Ve-Vnfm-vnf RP or indirectly via Ve-Vnfm-ve RP,
depicted as \"Flow-1\" on figure 7.2.1.1.1-1).
### A.4.2.2 Application level FM flow to be received by OSS/BSS from NFVO
The potential purpose/motivation is unknown for NS FM data to be received by
the OSS/BSS from NFVO (over Os-Ma-Nfvo RP, depicted as \"Flow-6\" on figure
7.2.1.1.1-1).
### A.4.2.3 Virtualized resource level FM to be received by EM
VNFM should be able to provide VNF related virtual resource fault report and
to EM through Ve-Vnfm-em interface (see clause 7.3.3.1 FM procedure flow for
correlation done in EM).
## A.4.3 Gaps related to definition of NSD operations
This clause outlines gaps identified in [2], related to definition of NSD
operations.
### A.4.3.1 Network Service Descriptor Management interface
_There are multiple references in [2], Annex C, to \"Network Service
Descriptor interface\" with reference to operations Update Network Service
Descriptor, Query Network Service Descriptor, Delete Network Service
Descriptor. However such interface is not defined in [2]. On the other hand,
there is Network Service Descriptor Management interface ([2], 7.1.1) which
includes these three operations._
### A.4.3.2 Network Service Descriptor states
_The document [2] does not provide clear definition of NSD states. Such
definition is needed to conclude which operations can be applied to the NSD at
the given moment._
## A.4.4 Use cases not supported by ETSI NFV GS MAN001 v1.1.1
### A.4.4.1 Notification of VNFCs impacted due to scheduled NFVI maintenance
According to potential requirement identified in REQ-NFVM_VN-LCM-CON-2 and
associated use case in clause 5.1.6 of the present document, the following
requirement applicable to ETSI NFV and currently not supported in [2] is
deemed necessary to be supported:
\- VNFM should provide the EM notification through Ve-Vnfm-em reference point
about VNF and its components whose virtualized resources will be impacted due
to scheduled maintenance of underlying infrastructure resources (e.g.
scheduled update of the hypervisor software or the firmware of a physical
machine (host)).
Such notification is sent by the VNFM to the EM in advance to the actual
maintenance. This notification is necessary so that the operator and
management systems can determine if anything can be done (e.g.,
reconfiguration of affected nodes that are neighbour to the subject VNF) to
minimize the impact and disruption of the VNF. This case is also relevant when
the network operator has different teams devoted to manage the 3GPP mobile
network and the NFV infrastructure.
### A.4.4.2 VNF snapshot capture
According to potential requirement identified in REQ-NFVM_VN-LCM-CON-3 and
associated use case in clause 5.1.8 of the present document, the following
requirement applicable to ETSI NFV and currently not supported in [2] is
deemed necessary to be supported:
\- VNFM should provide the capability to capture snapshot of a VNF or any of
its components through Ve-Vnfm-em reference point to EM, providing as a result
of the snapshot operation to EM with enough information to locate and identify
the snapshots.
These snapshots can be used for multiple purposes, e.g. troubleshooting,
rollback during erroneous VNF lifecycle management events or software upgrade,
for fast VNF re-deployment, etc.
### A.4.4.3 Notifications related to VNF auto-healing by VNFM
According to potential requirement identified in REQ-NFVM_VN-LCM-CON-5 and
associated use case in clause 5.1.5 of the present document, the following
requirement applicable to ETSI NFV and currently not supported in [2] is
deemed necessary to be supported:
\- VNFM should provide the following auto-healing notifications through Ve-
Vnfm-em reference point to the EM:
> \- A notification that the auto-healing execution is about to begin.
>
> \- A notification(s) about auto-healing execution progress.
>
> \- A notification about the success or failure of the healing execution.
The purpose of the notification of \"the auto-healing execution is about to
begin\" is to make EM aware of the auto-healing being executed by VNFM. For
instance, EM can delay or abandon actions that may impact the VNF which is
going to be "auto-healed". This is to avoid a conflict in case both EM and
VNFM deal with a VNF failure independently. Such situation may happen, if the
EM also detects some failure situation from VNF. EM can instruct the subject
VNF neighbour nodes not to attempt connection with the subject node while it
is in "auto-healing" execution.
### A.4.4.4 Notification related to VNF auto-scaling by VNFM
According to potential requirement identified in REQ-NFVM_VN-LCM-CON-18 and
associated use case in clause 5.5.20 of the present document, the following
requirement applicable to ETSI NFV and currently not supported in [2] is
deemed necessary to be supported:
\- VNFM should provide the EM the following auto-scaling notifications through
Ve-Vnfm-em reference point:
\- A notification that the auto-scaling execution is about to begin.
\- A notification(s) about auto-scaling execution progress..
\- A notification about the success or failure of the auto-scaling execution.
The purpose of the notification of \"the auto-scaling execution is about to
begin\" is to make EM aware of the auto- scaling being executed by VNFM. For
instance, EM can delay or abandon actions that may impact the VNF which is
going to be "auto-scaled". This would avoid scaling conflict in case the EM/NM
decides to scale the subject VNF based on scaling on demand method or scaling
by Management method..
EM can, if necessary, (re)configure the subject VNF neighbour nodes to account
for the newly auto-scaled VNF configuration/capacity.
###### ### Annex B: Ensemble
# B.1 Introduction
This annex introduces a number of ensembles. The benefits for identifying an
ensemble are listed within each ensemble clause.
Note: The choice of zero, one or more ensembles (of same or different vendors)
and zero, one or more functional blocks (of same or different vendors) for
network deployment is made by the operator.
# B.2 Ensemble 1
This Ensemble is an example that includes EM, VNFM, PNF and VNF as one
package. The package of this Ensemble is provided by the same vendor as shown
in Figure B.2-1.
From the Multi-vendor interoperability point of view:
a) The interactions between members of the Ensemble are not visible to
external (to Ensemble) entities and functional blocks and;
b) The interactions between the Ensemble and external (to Ensemble) entities
and functional blocks are visible.

Figure B.2-1 VNFM, EM, PNF and VNF as one Ensemble in mixed network
This Ensemble can be used in many deployment scenarios, one of which is
illustrated as example below.
In this deployment scenario, the interfaces supporting multi-vendor
interoperability from the perspective of the VNFM Ensemble are: Itf-N, Or-
Vnfm, Vi-Vnfm.
Figure B.2-2 Multi-vendor Interoperability interfaces
The benefits for the use of Ensemble 1 are:
\- To provide fast time to market implementation and simplify interoperability
provisioning and testing in multiple vendors environment.
\- To provide a migration path which minimizes the level of disruption of
service when introducing virtualized entities (functional blocks) into
operator\'s networks, whereby existing network management processes and tools
can be reused.
\- Assembling EM with VNFM would allow the use of the same set of network
management processes and tools to manage non-virtualized and virtualized
network functions.
\- Assembling EM, VNFM, VNF and NE (PNF) would allow leveraging vendor\'s
expertise on assembling existing EM and NE to coordinate with the new required
VNF and VNFM functionality.
\- Support of this ensemble would focus towards interoperability of one
vendor\'s VNFM with other vendors VIMs and NFVOs.
# B.3 Ensemble 2
This Ensemble includes EM and VNF as one package. The package of this Ensemble
is provided by the same vendor as shown in Figure B.3-1.
This Ensemble should be supplied as one package to provide for
interoperability over the Type 1 interface as shown in Figure B.3-1. The EM
and VNF typically are provided by the same vendor. They can be also provided
by different vendors in case when the vendors employ private (not standardized
in 3GPP) procedures to ensure interoperability between the EM and the VNF.
