# Introduction
The introduction of Key Quality Indicators (KQIs), which reflect the end-to-
end service performance and quality, could be used to better represent real
customer experience. NGMN NGCOR has defined principles for KQIs which could be
used to evaluate the customer experience for fixed and mobile networks. It is
proposed that SA5 takes the responsibility to study how to standardize the
related service KQIs providing a standardised common base for end-to-end
measurements and to fulfil the NGCOR requirements. KQIs have also been defined
by ETSI (TS 102.250), 3GPP SA4 (TR 26.944), NGMN (P-SERQU) and QuEST Forum
should also be considered.
The intention of KQI for the service experience is to try to reflect the
customer experience with indicators reflecting them for example how many
stalls occur while watching a movie, time delay before seeing the first screen
of a movie. With this information, KQI could closely reflect the customer
experience. The KPIs defined in the current specifications, e.g. 3GPP TS
32.450, are not differentiated by services, they only measure the bearer.
# 1 Scope
The present document will address:
1) Service KQI scenarios
2) Service KQIs corresponding to the identified scenarios
KQIs will be described for the below services:
\- Bidirectional voice
\- Unidirectional voice streaming
\- Unidirectional video streaming
\- Short Messaging
\- Multimedia Messaging
\- Web browsing
\- File transfer
\- E-mail
The present document will consider already defined metrics and requirements
from:
\- NGMN NGCOR phase 2 requirements
\- ETSI TS 102.250
\- 3GPP TR 26.944
\- NGMN P-SERQU
\- QuEST Forum TL9000

#### 4.1.1.1 QuEST Forum
Introduction to QuEST Forum and its work related to KQIs:
QuEST Forum is a global association that through its members develops and
implements quality and performance practices that unite and improve the ICT
industry.
General information about QuEST Forum, its Vision, Mission, Strategic
objectives and Value proposition can be found on the following page:
http://www.questforum.org/about-us/quest-forum-overview/
The so-called AQ-KPIs (Application Quality KPIs) in QuEST Forum correspond to
what is called KQIs in this study.
QuEST Forum AQ-KPIs are totally focused on the end user experience, by means
of referring to key events on the user's screen or loudspeaker or by the
user's own actions. They separate the services experience into clearly defined
phases giving the boundaries of the KPI's definitions. Therefore they are
future-proof, as they can be reused for different technology implementations
only impacting the technical triggers.
Legend for the different symbols used in the formulas:
\- \"->\" in UT and TT: \"X->Y\" means \"From X to Y\";
\- \"#\" means "number of\";
\- \"รท\" and \"/\" mean \"divided by\";
\- \"%\" means \"percentage of\", i.e. a value between 0 and 1;
\- \"Viewing time\" means \"from initial buffer is full until last content is
visible\".

of the video to take into account real human perception. Details of SSIM can
be found in appendix 9.2 of [8]. Video Quality Metric (VQM) Video Quality
Metric (VQM) is introduced in section 5.1.3 of NGMN P-SERQU [8]. It uses
reduced-reference metrics that utilizes features extracted from spatial-
temporal regions of the video sequence. Details of Video Quality Metric (VQM)
can be found in appendix 9.3 of [8]. Objective Perceptual Multimedia Video
Quality Measurement (VQUAD) Objective Perceptual Multimedia Video Quality
Measurement (VQUAD) is introduced in section 5.1.4 of NGMN P-SERQU [8]. It
uses full-reference metrics and has better robustness for new codecs and less
dependency on video types. Details of Objective Perceptual Multimedia Video
Quality Measurement (VQUAD) can be found in appendix 9.4 of [8].

# Structural Differences
## 6.1 QuEST Forum
QuEST Forum introduces the _Pyramid scheme of indicator categories_ as Figure
6.1.1:
{width="4.748611111111111in" height="2.5194444444444444in"}
Figure 6.1.1 Pyramid scheme of indicator categories
In the _pyramid scheme of indicator categories_ , by standing on the service
or user side the service experience related indicators are divided into 3
categories of the perception of quality, the delivery of services and the
supplying services. Among them, the indicators for the perception of quality
are based on the customer's experience for the E2E QoS (QoE) of the selected
applications, the indicators for the delivery of services are based on the one
or more causes within service delivery, and the indicators for the supplying
services are based on the root causes from supplying the service.
The selected applications can be read as taking a strong outside-in
perspective on telecom quality. Looking from the customer's quality of
experience towards the used services' contributions to the underlying network
performance and finally to the performance of the supply chain in charge to
supply this network performance.
## 6.2 ETSI
In the TS 102 250-1 [10] of ETSI, there is the introduction of the
relationship between QoE and QoS. the QoE Dimensions are as Figure 6.2.1:
{width="6.002083333333333in" height="1.9826388888888888in"}
Figure 6.2.1 QoE Dimensions
The QoE is measured subjectively by the end-user and may differ from one user
to the other. However, it is often estimated using objective measurements.
Contributing to the QoE are objective service performance measures such as
information loss and delay. Those objective measures together with subjective
human components that may include emotions, linguistic background, attitude,
motivation, etc.
The TS 102 250-1 [10] speification in ETSI also introduces the relationship
among the user satisfaction, QoS and the network performane as Figure
6.2.2.2.2:
{width="4.552083333333333in" height="3.8541666666666665in"}
Figure 6.2.2 Relationship among User satisfaction, QoS and Network performane
The relationship among the user satisfaction, QoS and the network performance
shows that the network performance is the main factor in the technology, and
the user satisfaction is impacted by the user's QoS requirements and
perception, the QoS offered and delivered by the service provider.
## 6.3 NGMN
In the NGMN-P-SERQU [8], there is the introduction of the relationship among
QoE, QoS and Network Performance as Figure 6..3.1:
{width="5.997222222222222in" height="3.8361111111111112in"}
Figure 6.3.1 NP, QoS, QoE model and terminology
In NGMN, the objects for the indicators in the service quality definition and
management are divided into 3 types of the customer, the service and the
network, and so that the indicators' categories are separately defined as QoE,
QoS and Network Performance (NP). QoE can reflect the E2E service quality for
the related applications, like the web browsing, the video, etc. QoS can
supply the service quality in the different components of the E2E service with
the accessibility, the integrity and the retainability for an application. A
step further, the NP can characterize the network performance of individual
network elements.
## 6.4 Summary
Among the above standards, the different parts and the same parts are as
below:
* * *
Items QuEST Forum/TL9000 ETSI NGMN Different Parts Different indicators types:
Delivery of Services, Supplying Service Dividing into the objective indicators
and the subjective indicators, Subjective human components๏ผTerminal

Perception of Service Quality as the experience quality Including QoE as the
user's satisfaction Including QoE as perceived subjectively by the end user
and QoS as the user satisfaction for the service Including Network Performance
indicators Including Network Performance Including Network Performance
* * *
Based on above information from other standard specifications, all indicators
systems have considered the service quality on the customer's and service's
stand. The technology for the service quality also needs supply for 3GPP.
# Functional Differences
## 7.1 QuEST Forum
QuEST Forum provides 6 categories of indicators to manage quality in
telecommunications, and the concrete layers and categories of indicators are
as below:
1) Perception of Quality Layer:
\- Category 1: End User Quality of Experience Indicators (like: QoE, NPS,
CCRR, GSI)
2) Delivery of Services Layer:
\- Category 2: Network Performance Indicators (like: SOx, CSD, EB
initiatives).
\- Category 3: Customer Service Indicators (like: Response Time, OTD, SQ).
3) Supplying of Services Layer:
\- Category 4: Network Operation Service Indicators (like: Managed Services ,
SSO , SQ, IRT).
\- Category 5: Network Element Quality Indicators (like: FR, BRR, NPR, SPR,
SONE, SFQ, SPR).
\- Category 6: Network Element related Services Indicators (like: FRT, OFR,
OTS (R, M, I), OTD, SQ, MTRS).
## 7.2 ETSI
In the TS 102 250-1 [10] speification in ETSI, the Service Independent QoS
Criteria are as below:
\- Unavailability: Unavailability describes the probability that a network or
service is not offered to a user.
\- Non-Accessibility: Non-accessibility parameters handle the probability that
the user cannot perform a successful access to a network or service when he
intends to use the network or service.
\- Time Parameters: Different time parameters occur in QoS measurements.
Typical representatives are time parameters like Access Time, Activation Time
or Setup Time.
\- Transfer Time: The transfer time is a basic parameter to calculate data
rates, meaning to divide the amount of transmitted data by the time period
which has been required to transfer this amount of data.
\- Content Integrity: Content integrity parameters describe the quality of the
transferred data. Typical representatives are parameters like \"Speech
Quality\", \"Video Quality\" or \"Data Integrity\".
The Service Dependent QoS Criteria are as below:
\- Rate Parameters: After a data link has been successfully established, these
parameters describe the average data transfer rate measured throughout the
entire connect time to the service.
\- Ratio Parameters: Ratio parameters reflect the relation between a subset
and a basic set.
\- Service Non-Accessibility: The service non-accessibility ratio denotes the
probability that a subscriber cannot access the desired service successfully.
\- Setup Time: The setup time describes the time period needed to access the
service successfully.
\- Failure Ratio: A failure ratio is the probability that a user experiences a
malfunction of a certain requested transaction.
\- Cut-off Ratio: A cut-off ratio describes the probability that a user
experiences an unintended termination of a transaction.
\- End-to-end Failure Ratio: The term end-to-end failure ratio defines the
probability that a transaction with end-to-end meaning fails.
\- End-to-end Delivery Time: The end-to-end delivery time represents the delay
that occurs when content is transferred across the complete transmission chain
from the data source to the data sink.
## 7.3 NGMN
In the NGMN-P-SERQU [8], NGMN mainly introduces the method to assess the
service quality on the user's perception side, and provide the standard to
judge the service quality model for a service by RMSE, PCC and SROCC, NGMN
provides the indicators for a classical service, namely the Video service, and
the categories of indicators are as below:
\- Accessibility.
\- Integrity(PSNR, SSIM, VQM, VQUAD, etc).
\- Retainability.
## 7.4 Summary
Among the above different standards, the indicators in NGMN should be the
basic classification for the service quality, so the main component is divided
into the Access Component, the Retainability Component, and the Integrity
Component, and the different parts are the other indicators item as below:
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Items | QuEST | ETSI | NGMN | | | Forum/TL9000 | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Access | Response Time, | U | Availability | | Component | | navailability, | | | | | Non- | | | | | Accessibility, | | | | | Time | | | | | Parameters, | | | | | | | | | | Service | | | | | Non- | | | | | Accessibility, | | | | | Setup Time, | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Retainability | SOx,CSD, SONE, | Failure Ratio, | Retainability | | Component | MTRS | Cut-off Ratio, | | | | | End-to-end | | | | | Failure Ratio | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Integrity | EB | Transfer Time, | I | | Component | initiatives, | Content | ntegrity(PSNR, | | | SSO , | Integrity, | SSIM, VQM, | | | | Rate | VQUAD, etc) | | | | Parameters, | | | | | End-to-end | | | | | Delivery Time | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Other | QoE, NPS, | Ratio | No Indicator | | Indicators | CCRR, GSI, | Parameters | | | | OTD, SQ, | | | | | Managed | | | | | Services , | | | | | IRT, FR, BRR, | | | | | NPR, SPR, SFQ, | | | | | SPR, FRT, OFR, | | | | | OTS (R, M, I), | | | | | OTD, SQ | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
Based on above information from the different standard specifications, all
have considered the service quality with the accessibility, retainability and
integrity, which are defined in NGMN, but the concrete indicators are
different, in 3GPP the indicators for the service quality should be uniformed
to avoid confusion.
# Conclusions
By studying the KQIs for the service experience defined in QuEST Forum, ETSI,
and NGMN, we have found that:
\- In different standardization organizations, the definitions of the service
quality for different applications are different and the structures for the
service quality indicators also are different;
\- In NGMN, the requirements for the service quality suggest that the
indicators are classified into 3 categories: accessibility, integrity and
retainability. In QuEST Forum and ETSI, most service quality indicators can
also fit into these 3 categories, but there are few exceptions.
It is suggested that the structure of service quality indicators in 3GPP
should reuse that in NGMN, and the service experience KQIs in 3GPP should be
defined in 3 categories: accessibility, integrity, and retainability. In
Clause 5, Service KQIs corresponding to 8 scenarios are defined according to
these principles. Future work in 3GPP defining service KQIs for additional
scenarios, if any, should also comply with these principles.
Follow-up work of this study will address:
\- Service KQIs for potential additional scenarios, and
\- Measurement points in 3GPP network for the identified service KQIs.
###### ### Annex A: Mobile MOS Scenario
With the development of mobile broadband networks, the traffic carried is
changing from traditional voice into a wide range of mobile Internet based
applications. If we use traditional KQI definition to describe the user
service experience of these applications, due to the different characteristics
of the applications, we need multiple indicators, and the indicators are
different for various applications. This will bring trouble in service
experience presentation and product design, so we need to adopt an integrated
indicator to define service experience.
According to human factors engineering research, subjective experience exists
for various levels of perception, for example, from imperceptions, to lose
focus, and finally give up. For voice services, ITU have used MOS (Mean
Opinion Score) to define the voice quality based on the subjective experience.
In implementation, due to the high cost and time-consuming, subjective
measurements are replaced by objective measurements to calculate MOS and
assess voice quality.
For defining the integrated experience indicator for mobile internet
applications, we can learn from the voice MOS definition, and use Mobile MOS
to synthetically assess the multiple KQIs of mobile applications. In the
Mobile MOS definition, the following key factors need to be considered:
1\. Continuity. The meaning and hierarchy should be consistent with existing
voice MOS.
2\. Measurability. In the commercial implementations, objective indicator
scores can be calculated by a series of parameters which are easy to measure.
3\. Mobility. Need to consider the characteristics of the mobile network and
the device, such as the terminal screen size will affect the user\'s
experience.
4\. Diversity. Need to define the corresponding MOS scheme for various mobile
internet applications such as web, video, file transfer, and other popular
applications.
5\. Evolvability. With the improvement quality of mobile applications, the
user experience will gradually improve. Therefore, the definition of the best
experience will adapt to the changes of application.
For example, for the MOS definition of mobile video, the assessment object is
adaptive video service based on TCP protocol. Factors affecting service
experience are the quality of video source, and the buffering event introduced
during transmission. When evaluating the quality of the video source, the main
consideration is video codec, frame rate, resolution and bit rate. When
assessing the impact of buffering, the initial loading time, and the stalling
duration during playing stage will be considered.
Generally when defining mobile MOS for web browsing and other applications, we
also need to take into consideration their service characteristics, and assess
the key factors which affect the experience.\
