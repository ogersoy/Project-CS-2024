The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor GSM, UMTS or LTE PLMN.
During the lifetime of a PLMN, its logical and physical configuration will
undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise the
utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed through
network configuration management activities and/or network engineering, see
3GPP TS 32.600 [3].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a PLMN network require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document and its companion
specifications in the TS family 2 and 3 is to describe the mechanisms involved
in the collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the requirements for the management of
performance measurements and the collection of performance measurement result
data across GSM, UMTS and LTE networks. It defines the administration of
measurement schedules by the Network Element Manager (EM), the generation of
measurement results in the Network Elements (NEs) and the transfer of these
results to one or more Operations Systems, i.e. EM(s) and/or Network
Manager(s) (NM(s)).
The basic Performance Management concept that the present document is built
upon is described in clause 4.\ The requirements of how an EM administers the
performance measurements and how the results can be collected are defined in
detail in clause 5. Measurements available for collection by NEs are described
in the following specifications:
\- TS 52.402 for GSM systems;
\- TS 32.405, TS 32.406, TS 32.407 and TS 32.408 for UMTS and combined
UMTS/GSM systems;
\- TS 32.409 for IMS networks;
\- TS 32.425 for E-UTRAN:
\- TS 32.426 for EPC:
\- TS 32.452 for Home Node B (HNB) Subsystem (HNS):
\- TS 32.453 for Home enhanced Node B (HeNB) Subsystem (HeNS):
\- TS 28.402 for Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access Interworking
System:
\- TS 28.403 for **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**
> Effort has been made to ensure consistency in the definition of measurements
> between different NEs and generations. The performance measurement result is
> described in Performance Measurement File Format Definition (3GPP TS 32.432
> [29]).
The following is beyond the scope of the present document, and therefore the
present document does not describe:
\- the formal definition of the interface that the EM uses to administer
performance measurements in the NEs;
\- the formal definition of the interface that the EM uses to collect
measurement results from the NEs;
\- how the data, once accumulated and collected, could or should be processed,
stored, or presented to an end user;
\- the information which may be obtained through the collection and processing
of call or event related records which have been produced by the NEs primarily
for the purpose of raising bills and other charges.
The management requirements have been derived from existing telecommunications
operations experience. The management definitions were then derived from other
standardisation work so as to minimise the re-invention factor. References are
given as appropriate.
The objectives of this standardisation are:
\- to provide the descriptions for a standard set of measurements;
\- to produce a common description of the management technique for measurement
administration and result accumulation; and
\- to define a method for the bulk transmission of measurement results across
a management interface.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement result data produced in a multi-vendor wireless
network, for those measurement types that can be standardised across all
vendors\' implementations.
As far as possible, existing standardisation in the area of Performance
Management has been re-used and enhanced where particular requirements,
peculiar to the mobile telephony environment, have been recognised.
The present document considers all the above aspects of Performance Management
for a GSM, UMTS or LTE network and its NEs defined in the core Technical
Specifications. However, only those aspects which are specific to a
GSM/UMTS/LTE system and particular to wireless network operation are included
in the present document.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**network Element Manager (EM):** provides a package of end-user functions for
management of a set of closely related types of Network Elements. These
functions can be divided into two main categories:
\- Element Management Functions for management of Network Elements on an
individual basis. These are basically the same functions as supported by the
corresponding local terminals.
\- Sub-Network Management Functions that are related to a network model for a
set of Network Elements constituting a clearly defined sub-network, which may
include relations between the Network Elements. This model enables additional
functions on the sub-network level (typically in the areas of network topology
presentation, alarm correlation, service impact analysis and circuit
provisioning).
**Network Manager (NM):** provides a package of end-user functions with the
responsibility for the management of a network, mainly as supported by the
EM(s) but it may also involve direct access to the Network Elements. All
communication with the network is based on open and well-standardised
interfaces supporting management of multi-vendor and multi-technology Network
Elements.
**Operations System (OS):** generic management system, independent of its
location level within the management hierarchy.

# 4 Concept
Any evaluation of PLMN-system behaviour will require performance data
collected and recorded by its NEs according to a schedule established by the
EM. This aspect of the management environment is termed Performance
Management. The purpose of any Performance Management activity is to collect
data, which can be used to verify the physical and logical configuration of
the network and to locate potential problems as early as possible. The type of
data to be collected is defined by the equivalent measurements (refer to TS
52.402 [22] and TS 32.404 [31]). The present document concentrates on the
requirements of GSM, UMTS and LTE telecom management to produce this data. Any
management actions performed at the OSs subsequently to analyse the
performance data are not considered in the present document.
Data is required to be produced by the NEs to support the following areas of
performance evaluation:
\- traffic levels within the network, including the level of both the user
traffic and the signalling traffic (clause 4.1.1);
\- verification of the network configuration (clause 4.1.2);
\- resource access measurements (clause 4.1.3);
\- Quality of Service (e.g. delays during call set-up, packet throughput, etc)
(clause 4.1.4); and
\- resource availability (e.g. the recording of begin and end times of service
unavailability) (clause 4.1.5).
The production of the measurement result data by the NEs also needs to be
administered by the EM. Several phases of administration of performance
measurements can be distinguished:
\- the management of the performance measurement collection process (clause
4.2.1);
\- the generation of performance measurement results (clause 4.2.2);
\- the local storage of measurement results in the NE (clause 4.2.3);
\- the transfer of measurement results from the NE to an OS (EM and/or NM)
(clause 4.2.4); and
\- the storage, preparation and presentation of results to the operating
personnel (clause 4.2.5).
In respect to the evaluation of the results produced by the measurements the
following has to be considered:
\- to understand the nature of the results received from the network (clause
4.3.1);
\- to assure the reliability and accuracy of the measurement results (clause
4.3.2);
\- to ensure comparable measurement results for the same measurements being
performed in equipment from different vendors (clause 4.3.3);
\- the ability to identify the results in the management systems: with respect
to the measurement jobs by the EM, and with respect to the measurement types
and measured resources by the NM (clause 4.3.4); and
\- to take into account that, in a set of n correlated measurements, any (n-1)
out of the defined n measurements may be provided by the network (clause
4.3.5).
Performance measurements may also be used to supervise operator defined
threshold values and generate alarms upon exceeding the thresholds (clause
4.4).
The following clauses provide further background on the performance
measurement concept that is applicable to GSM, UMTS and LTE networks. Although
any implementation of GSM, UMTS and LTE network elements shall adopt the
concept described below, not all of the text - due to its conceptual nature -
is usable to actually determine compliance of the equipment. In these cases,
more strictly specified requirements, against which conformance shall be
proven, are found in clause 5 of the present document.
## 4.1 Measurement result data requirements
This clause describes the typical requirements for performance data to be
produced by the NEs, which comprise a GSM, UMTS or LTE network. It is
important to note that an actual measurement value collected from the network
may be used to satisfy requirements in more than one category of measurement
described below.
### 4.1.1 Traffic measurements
Traffic measurements provide the data from which, among other uses, the
planning and operation of the network can be carried out.
The types of traffic evaluations for which PLMN specific measurements may be
used include:
\- traffic load on the radio or core network interfaces (signalling and user
traffic);
\- usage of resources within the network nodes;
\- user activation and use of supplementary services, etc.
Examples of measured values may include:
\- pages per location area per hour;
\- busy hour call attempts per BSC, RNC, MSC;
\- handovers per BSC/RNC per hour, etc.
### 4.1.2 Network configuration evaluation
Once a network plan, or changes to a network plan, have been implemented it is
important to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan or planned
changes. Typically, the measurements required to support this activity
indicate the traffic levels with particular relevance to the way the traffic
uses the network.
### 4.1.3 Resource access
For accurate evaluation of resource access, each measurement result would need
to be produced for regular time intervals across the network, or for a
comparable part of the network.
### 4.1.4 Quality of Service (QoS)
The user of a PLMN views the provided service from outside the network. That
perception can be described in observed QoS terms. QoS can indicate the
network performance expected to be experienced by the user. For further detail
see ITU-T Recommendation E.880 [5].
The QoS parameters applied by the network to specific user services may also
be relevant to determine the charges levied towards the user for the provision
of those services.
### 4.1.5 Resource availability
The availability performance is dependent on the defined objectives, i.e. the
availability performance activities carried out during the different phases of
the life cycle of the system, and on the physical and administrative
conditions. For further detail see ITU-T Recommendation E.880 [5].
## 4.2 Measurement administration
The range of measurements which will be available from the NEs are expected to
cover all of the requirements described in clause 4.1. However, not all of
these measurements will be required all of the time, from every occurrence, of
every relevant NE. Therefore, it is necessary to administer the measurements
so as to determine which measurement types, on which measured resources, at
which times, are to be executed. With a highly distributed network like a GSM,
UMTS or LTE mobile telecommunication system it is also necessary to gather the
measurement result data so as to perform consistent analysis of the results
and to evaluate the interactions between the NEs.
This clause describes the requirements for the various areas of administration
of measurements.
### 4.2.1 Measurement job administration
Measurement jobs, i.e. the processes which are executed in the NEs in order to
accumulate measurement result data and assemble it for collection and/or
inspection, will need to be scheduled by the EM for the period or periods for
which gathering of data shall be performed.
The administration of measurement jobs by the EM comprises the following
actions:
1) Create/delete a measurement job. This action implies the instantiation
respectively deletion of a measurement collection process within the network.
2) Modifying a measurement job, i.e. changing the parameters (specifically the
schedule) of a measurement job that has been previously created.
3) Definition of measurement job scheduling. This action defines the period or
periods during which the measurement job is configured to collect performance
data.
4) Specification of the measurement types to be contained in the job, e.g.
\"number of GPRS attach attempts\".\ In GSM, the measurement jobs are
administered by individual measurement types, which are specified in TS 52.402
[22]. In UMTS and LTE, the measurement jobs may be administered per individual
measurement type or per measurement family, which comprises a collection of
related measurement types. The measurement types and families for UMTS and
combined GSM/UMTS networks are specified in TS 32.405 [32], TS 32.406 [33], TS
32.407 [34], TS 32.408 [35] and specified in TS 32.409 [36] for IMS.
Measurement types and families for E-UTRAN are specified in TS 32.425 [37] and
for EPC in TS 32.426 [38]. Measurement types and families for Home Node B
(HNB) Subsystem (HNS) are defined in TS 32.452 [39] and for Home enhanced Node
B (HeNB) Subsystem (HeNS) in TS.32.453 [40].
5) Identification of the measured resources, i.e. the NEs (e.g. MSC, NodeB) or
NE components (e.g. trunkgroups, radio channels, transceivers) to which the
measurement types or measurement families, specified in the measurement job,
pertain.
6) Suspend/resume a measurement job. The \"suspend\" action inhibits the
collection of measurement result data by a measurement job, regardless of its
schedule, without deleting it. The \"resume\" action will re-enable
measurement result data collection according to the measurement job schedule.
It may also be possible for the system to suspend a measurement job without
any operator's action in case of overload. It should then be possible, at any
time, for the operator to resume a job suspended by the system.
7) Setting up any necessary requirements for the reporting and routing of
results to one or more OSs (EM and/or NM).
8) Retrieval of information related to measurement jobs, i.e. view the current
measurement job definition.
A measurement job is thus characterised by a set of measurement types and/or
measurement families which all pertain to the same set of measured resources
and share the same schedule. Typically a large number of measurement jobs will
run simultaneously within the NEs comprising the PLMN, and one or more EM is
involved in the administration of those measurement jobs. In order for the
operator to manage this large number of measurement jobs effectively and
efficiently, it is necessary that the administration functions in the EM can
not only deal with individual measurements on individual NEs, but also scope
the execution environment across the measured resources, and apply an
additional filter to the resources/NEs selected by the measurement scope. The
scoping and filtering of the measurement(s) shall then be automatically
adapted if measured resources that match the selection criteria are added or
removed.
There are several instances of this \"plug&measure\" feature:
1) execute the same (set of) measurement type(s) on a set of identical
resources within a single NE. An example of this is to measure the average bit
error rate on all channels in a cell, or all channels of the cell that match
the filter criterion;
2) execute the same (set of) measurement type(s) on a set of identical NEs or
resources according to the hierarchical structure of the network. Examples of
this are to measure the average bit rate on all Iu~PS~ links of the same U-MSC
or to measure inter-cell handovers for all cells attached to the same BSC;
3) execute the same (set of) measurement type(s) across all resources/NEs of
the same type that belong to a specific administrative domain. An example of
this is to measure the call set-up failure rate in all cells located in a
certain city, or otherwise defined geographical area (this may be a
combination of scope and filter), or within the responsibility area of system
operator number 2.
The definition of those administrative, or management, domains may be part of
either the measurement job administration functions or the CM functions
provided by the EM. The functionality of scoping and filtering of measurements
within the same NE may either be distributed across the NE and the EM (e.g. EM
creates a single measurement job with scope and filter, and NE determines the
measured resources that match the selection criteria), or it may be realised
solely in the EM (EM determines measured resources from the scope and filter
specified by the system operator, and multiple measurement jobs will be
created), according to implementation choice.
### 4.2.2 Measurement result generation
Each measurement job will be collecting result data at a particular frequency,
known as the granularity period of the measurement job. At the end of the
granularity period a scheduled result report is generated for each measurement
job that is actively collecting performance measurement result data, i.e. for
all the measurement types and measured resources covered by the job.
The measurement result data can be collected in each NE of the network with a
number of collection methods:
\- cumulative incremental counters triggered by the occurrence of the measured
event;
\- status inspection (i.e. a mechanism for high frequency sampling of internal
counters at pre-defined rates);
\- gauges (i.e. high tide mark, low tide mark);
\- discrete event registration, where data related to a particular event is
captured.
These collection methods are:
**\- Cumulative Counter (CC):** The NE maintains a running count of the event
being counted. The counter is reset to a well-defined value (usually \"0\") at
the beginning of each granularity period.
**\- Status Inspection (SI):** Network elements maintain internal counts for
resource management purposes. These counts are read at a predetermined rate,
the rate is usually based upon the expected rate of change of the count value.
Status inspection measurements shall be reset at the beginning of the
granularity period and will only have a valid result at the end of the
granularity period.
**\- Gauge:** Gauges represent dynamic variables that may change in either
direction. Gauges can be integer or real valued. If a gauge is required to
produce low and high tide marks for a granularity period (e.g. minimum and
maximum call duration), then it shall be reinitialised at the beginning of
each granularity period. If a gauge is required to produce a consecutive
readout over multiple granularity periods (e.g. cabinet temperature), then it
shall only be reinitialised at the start of a recording interval (see
definition of \"recording interval\" in clause 5. 4.1. 3).
**\- Discrete Event Registration (DER):** Data related to a particular event
is captured. Every n^th^ event is registered, where n can be 1 or larger. The
value of n is dependent on the frequency of occurrence of the event being
measured.\ DER measurements shall be reset at the beginning of each
granularity period and will only have a valid result at the end of the
granularity period.
The measurement result data can be collected in a non-3GPP defined NE of the
network with a number of collection methods which are not defined in this
document. These collection methods are referred to as "externally defined
collection methods"
**This following item describes the collection method to be used for
collecting measurements result data from a non-3GPP defined NE.**
**Transparent Forwarding (TF)** : The non-3GPP defined NE maintains a count
based on the NE's "externally defined collection method". The 3GPP system
maintains a measurement count that is a snapshot/reading of the non-3GPP
defined NE count at each granularity period.
### 4.2.3 Local storage of results at the NE/EM
It is necessary for the NE to retain measurement result data it has produced
until they have been sent to, or retrieved by, the destination OS(s).
Depending on implementation and configuration details, e.g. the transfer
method, the number and type (EM/NM) of the destination OS(s), this data will
be retained at the NE under the control of the destination OS(s), or solely
under the control of the EM. The storage capacity and the duration for which
the data will be retained at the NE will be Operator and implementation
dependent.
If the measurement result data are routed to an NM via the EM, then it is
necessary for the EM to retain the data at least until they have been
successfully transferred to the NM. The storage capacity and the duration for
which the data will be retained at the EM are Operator and implementation
dependent.
### 4.2.4 Measurement result transfer
Measurement results produced by the NEs are transferred to an external OS for
storage, post-processing, and presentation to the system operator for further
evaluation. In a network with more than one OS (e.g. EM and NM) the data may
be required by several OSs. It is therefore necessary to support the
possibility for multiple destinations for the transfer of measurement result
data.
**From the NE to the EM,** the results of the measurement jobs can be
forwarded in either of two standard ways:
1) the scheduled result reports, generated by the measurement jobs executing
in the NE, can be sent to the EM as soon as they are available
(notifications);
2) the reports can be stored in the NE (files) and transferred to or retrieved
by the EM when required.
**From the network to the NM,** measurement results can be forwarded via a
bulk transfer (i.e. file-based) interface. It is an implementation option
whether this interface to the NM resides in the EM or in the NEs.
It should be noted that, depending on an Operator\'s needs, measurement
results may have to be transferred to the EM only, the NM only, or both.
Depending on a vendor\'s implementation, measurement results may be
transferred to the NM directly from the NE or via the EM. This implies that
not all of the result transfer options described above have to be implemented
in all cases.
### 4.2.5 Performance data presentation
The performance data user interface presentation, including the storage and
preparation of the data in the OS(s), is outside the scope of the present
document.
## 4.3 Measurement type definitions
This clause looks at the requirements for the definition of the individual
measurement types.
### 4.3.1 Nature of the result
The measurement types defined for the GSM and UMTS systems have to be
collected in the NEs. As each NE has its own role to play in the provision of
the mobile service then each will have a different perspective on the
performance of the network. The measurement type definitions shall, therefore,
contain a description of the intended result of the measurement in terms of
what is being measured. Appropriate information is included in the measurement
type definition templates, see TS 52.402 [22] and TS 32.404 [31].
### 4.3.2 Perceived accuracy
The accuracy of measurements can be seen in three ways:
\- whether the result produced represents all occurrences of the defined
event;
\- whether related measurements produced for the same period refer to the same
events; or
\- whether a measurement result refers to the whole or part of a granularity
period.
**Representation of all occurrences:** the definition of a measurement needs
to accurately reflect which types of events are to be included in the
collection of the data. If a general event or procedure description can be
characterised by several sub-types then the measurement definition will have
to be precise as to which sub-types are included or specifically excluded from
that measurement. Depending on the measurement definition, it may prove more
acceptable to count the event or procedure by causes, e.g. successful
termination, unsuccessful termination for all reasons. If the definition of a
measurement refers to specific failure causes then care shall be taken to
assess whether all causes are included - the sum of which can provide the
total number of failures - or whether a count of the total is defined as well
as for the specific causes. This is particularly important if not all of the
causes are supported by an implementation, or if not all of the causes are
requested in the measurement job definition.
**Same period for the same two events:** consider two events being counted
which refer to the same resource allocation procedure, falling on either side
of a granularity period boundary. I.e. the attempt is counted in one period
while the termination is counted in the subsequent period. This will lead to
discrepancies appearing in the actual figures when trying to compare attempt
and termination counts for the same period. In order to avoid this
discrepancy, implementations shall ensure that the termination of a procedure
started within a given granularity period shall be captured within the
measurement results for that same period, even if the termination of the
procedure falls within the next granularity period.
**Measurement collection periods:** a typical measurement collection period
can be interrupted by system events.
These interruptions can be one or more of the following:
a) failure of the measured network resource;
b) failure of the measurement procedure;
c) the measured network resource only becomes available after the measurement
period has commenced;
d) the measurement procedure only becomes available after the measurement
period has commenced.
e) system error (e.g. disk failure/lack of memory);
f) communication error (e.g. link failure between the network manager and the
measured network resource).
Any such interruption implies that the affected measurement result is
incomplete, and in extreme circumstances, no result reports at all can be
generated. In these cases the measurement result shall highlight such
interruptions to indicate that the result is suspect (see also setting of
suspectFlag in Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432
[29]).\ Any actions to be taken subsequently with regards to the usefulness of
the data will depend on the circumstances and the requirements of individual
Operators.
### 4.3.3 Comparability of measurement result data
In a multi-vendor network it is important to know that measurement result data
produced by equipment from one supplier is equivalent to the measurement
result data being produced by the equivalent equipment from another supplier.
This is particularly important when analysing data across the whole network.
The measurement type definitions (in TS 52.402 [22], TS 32.405[32], TS 32.406
[33], TS 32.407 [34], TS 32.408 [35],TS 32.409 [36], TS 32.425 [37], TS 32.426
[38], TS 32.452 [39] and TS 32.453 [40]) shall therefore use a common
understanding of the events being measured (e.g. by relating to protocol
messages) so as to produce comparable results.
### 4.3.4 Measurement identification
In complex networks it is easy to generate large amounts of performance data.
For the administration of the measurement jobs, and for the attribution of
result data to the correct measurements, it is essential for the EM that all
measurement result data is recognisable in respect of each request made. For
post-processing of the measurement results in the NM, it is essential that
measurement results can be attributed to the correct measurement types and
NEs/measured resources.
As all the required information to distinguish the measurement results for
each request, already exists in the definition of the request, it makes sense
to use this information, rather than create anything new. The information,
which can be used to distinguish requests from each other\'s, may be e.g. NE
name, measurement type, granularity period, or a combination of these. NE
names defined within the realm of CM (3GPP TS 32.600 [3] and the associated
network resource model in other 32.6xx TSs) shall be reused. For the
measurement job administration in the EM, it is also possible to use
measurement job ids, or other implementation specific parameters that identify
the measurements.
### 4.3.5 (n-1) out of n approach
The measurement result values generated by a NE can be obtained in a number of
different ways. For example, measurements can be defined to provide the number
of attempts for a certain procedure plus the number of failures and the number
of successes, where the sum of the successes and failures equals the number of
attempts. This means that actually any 2 of the above 3 measurements provide
the same information. Therefore, an approach has been adopted in the present
document and its companions, 3GPP TS 52.402 [22] and 3GPP TS 32.404 [31], to
allow a vendor to choose any (n-1) out of the n defined counters for
implementation (2 out of 3 in the above example). The benefit of this approach
is to avoid redundancy in the measurement implementation, while at the same
time leaving freedom for implementation of the measurements in the network
elements. As all n result values of the measurement results are relevant for
system operators, the missing n^th^ value shall be calculated by post-
processing running on the NM.
It is important to note, however, that, depending on the measurement type
definition, some implementation choices can offer more detailed information
than others. For example, if per-cause failure measurements are specified,
then the implementation of the \"attempts\" and \"successes\" measurements
still allows post-processing to calculate the number of failures, but per
cause information can not be derived. Therefore, in this case, the failure
measurement should always be implemented, while there is still freedom to
choose the \"attempts\" or the \"successes\" measurement as the other one to
be implemented. The \"failure\" measurement should still be capable of
delivering a total value, if not all failure causes are supported or if the
results are not requested for (all of) the failure causes in the set-up of the
measurement job.
Note that the principal problem, described above, also exists for measurements
where sub-types are specified.
## 4.4 Performance alarms
Instead of, or in addition to, generating regular scheduled result reports,
measurements may be administered in a way so as to supervise operator-defined
thresholds. The thresholds are set when instantiating the measurements, and
alarms are generated when the threshold value is crossed. These performance
alarms are generated instead of, or in addition to, the generation of the
scheduled result reports, as configured by the system operator. In UMTS, the
alarms are sent to the OS via the Alarm IRP specified in TS 32.111-2 [21]. In
GSM, according to implementation choice, the alarms are sent either via the
Alarm IRP or via the Q3 interface specified in the GSM 12.xx series of
specifications. Depending on the nature of the measurement (cumulative
counter, status inspection, gauge, discrete event registration), the observed
value, which is checked against the threshold, can only be derived at the end
of a granularity period (status inspection and discrete event registration),
and may have to be reset at the beginning of a new granularity period (cf.
clause 4.2.2).
A GSM, UMTS or LTE NE may also generate threshold alarms based on system-
internal supervision of counters and their threshold values. Neither the
threshold nor the counters can be administered, but they depend on internal
system behaviour, defined by implementation. As the present document only
specifies results and alarms based on manageable performance measurements, the
system internal threshold alarms explained above are outside the scope of the
present document and are solely within the realms of Fault Management.
# 5 Functional requirements
## 5.1 Introduction
This clause describes all basic functions to allow the system operator to have
measurement data collected by the NEs and to forward the results to one or
more OS(s), i.e. EM and/or NM. All functions are gathered to provide the
system operator with the means to administer, plan, execute measurements and
to store and evaluate the measurement results.
Building on the concept established in clause 4 of the present document, the
following clauses further specify the requirements that all standard GSM, UMTS
and LTE implementations shall comply to.
## 5.2 Basic functions
The Performance Management concept as applicable in the present document is
based on the general framework for 3Gâ€‘telecom management defined in 3GPP TS
32.101 [1] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [2]. A particular feature of this general
framework is the existence of the fully standardised interface labelled
\"Itf-N\", that connects the network with the Network Manager (NM). In the
context of Performance Management, Itf-N can be used for:
\- the transfer of files containing performance measurement result data
generated in the network;
\- the emission of \"performance alarms\" (notifications).
It should be pointed out that, on the network side, Itf-N may be implemented
either in the NEs or in the EM, according to vendor choice.
As an example, figure 1 outlines this concept in the context of the UTRAN.
As the O&M functions for NodeB are partitioned into Logical and Implementation
Specific O&M (see 3GPP TR 32.800 [20]), it should be understood that the
functionalities described in the present document are completely within the
scope of Implementation Specific O&M. This implies that no information
pertaining to measurement administration and result transfer, as described
here, is exchanged between the RNC and NodeB via the Iub interface. Such
information may, however, be sent or received by the NodeB over the Iub
physical bearer, see 3GPP TS 25.442 [4].
Figure 1: UTRAN Performance management concept
The basic requirement from an NE for measurements is to collect data according
to the definition of the measurement jobs and to provide results to at least
one OS (EM and/or NM). The data collected in the NE shall be made available
for collection by or transfer to the OS(s) according to the schedule defined
by the measurement job parameters. The NE shall be able to supply the result
data at least to the NM if the Itf-N is implemented in the NEs, result
provision from the NE to the EM is optional in this case. The NE shall be able
to provide the result data to the EM if the Itf-N is implemented in the EM.
The EM shall be able to administer the measurements, e.g. create/delete
measurement jobs and define their schedules. If the measurement results are
transferred from the NEs to the EM, then the EM can control:
\- the immediate (\"real time\") transfer of scheduled reports from the NE to
the EM;
\- the storage of scheduled reports in the NE; and
\- deferred retrieval by the EM of scheduled reports stored in the NE.
In GSM, the optional Q3 interface specified in 3GPP TS 52.402 [22] can be used
to perform these functions, while in UMTS, they are executed through a
proprietary interface. Depending on the implementation option chosen for the
Itf-N, the EM and/or NM may be involved in the control of the measurement
result transfer to the NM.
The basic functions of the NM are beyond the scope of the present document.
However, any NM that supports the network functions as described here must
provide the NM side of the Itf-N, and the ability to handle the measurement
result data that it receives, according to the file format(s) specified in the
Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432 [29]. The
measurement result data may then be used in its original form or post-
processed according to the system operator requirements. It is further
anticipated that NM systems will have sophisticated functions for the
management, preparation and presentation of the measurement result data in
various forms.
The following clause summarises the measurement administration functions
required in GSM, UMTS and LTE networks. They are then specified in more detail
in clauses 5.x below.
**(Performance) measurement administration functions** allow the system
operator, using functions of the EM, to determine measurement data collection
in the network and forwarding of the results to one or more OS(s).
**(Performance) measurement administration functions** cover:
1) measurement data collection requirements:
\- **measurement types.** Corresponds to the measurements as defined in TS
52.402 [22], 3GPP TS 32.405 [32], TS 32.406 [33], TS 32.407 [34], TS 32.408
[35], TS 32.409 [36], TS 32.425 [37], TS 32.426 [38], 32.452 [39] , 32.453
[40] , TS 28.402 [41] and TS 28.403 [42] or defined by other standards bodies,
or manufacturer defined measurement types;
\- **measured network resources.** The resource(s) to which the measurement
types shall be applied have to be specified, e.g. one or more NodeB(s);
\- **measurement recording** , consisting of periods of time at which the NE
is collecting (that is, making available in the NE) measurement data.
2) measurement reporting requirements:
\- this allows the system operator to specify the measurement related
information to be reported, if required (e.g. omitting zero valued counts)..
The frequency at which scheduled result reports shall be generated also has to
be defined, if it may deviate from the granularity period. Particular
functions, which exceed the requirements set out in the present document, are
provided if the optional Q3 interface specified in 3GPP TS 52.402 [22] is
implemented for GSM.
3) measurement result transfer requirements:
\- The result transfer requirements in the present document are limited to the
file based Itf-N, used to forward the measurement results to the NM. If ItF-N
is implemented in the EM, then measurement results can be transferred from the
NE to the EM, and/or they are stored locally in the NE and can be retrieved
when required. If Itf-N is implemented in the NEs, then the PM result files
are sent directly from the NE to the NM, involving control by the EM as
required, The EM shall support all administration functions necessary to
fulfil the above result transfer requirement.;
\- measurement results can be stored in the network (NEs or EM, depending on
implementation option chosen for Itf-N) for retrieval by the NM when required.
**A (performance) measurement job,** covers the measurement data collection as
described in point 1 above. If the Q3 interface for GSM is implemented, it
also covers the measurement reporting requirements, as described in point 2
above. In UMTS, the reporting requirements may be covered by the measurement
job, or they may be administered per NE, per management domain, or per EM, as
chosen by the vendor. It is up to the implementation whether requirements for
the result transfer or the local storage of results are specified within the
measurement job, particularly since the use of standard protocols, such as
FTP, is foreseen.
A measurement job can be created, modified, displayed or deleted by the EM. In
addition, measurement job activities in the NE can be suspended and resumed on
request of the EM.
The system operator shall specify the required measurement parameters upon
initiation of a measurement job. These parameters consist of, among others,
recording schedule, granularity, and measurement type(s), as listed above.
A standard set of measurements that generate the required data is defined in
3GPP TS 52.402 [22] for GSM, in 3GPP\ TS 32.405 [32], TS 32.406 [33], TS
32.407 [34], TS 32.408 [35] for UMTS and combined GSM/UMTS systems,in TS
32.409 [36] for IMS, in TS 32.425 [37] for E-UTRAN, in TS 32.426 [38] for EPC,
in TS 32.452 [39] for Home Node B (HNB) Subsystem (HNS) and in TS.32.453 [40]
for Home enhanced Node B (HeNB) Subsystem (HeNS) , in TS 28.402 [41] for
Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access Interworking System and in TS
28.403 [42] for **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**. However, a significant
number of additional measurements is expected from real implementations. These
will mainly consist of measurements for the underlying technologies, which are
not 3G specific, such as ATM or IP, but is also due to specific vendor
implementations. While the NM interface (Itf-N) for result transfer of both
standard and non-standard measurements is fully standardised Performance
Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432 [29], the interface between
EM and NE is only standardised in functional terms. In UMTS, implementation
details of this interface are vendor specific. In GSM, it may be
implementation specific or implemented in compliance with the OSI interface
specified in 3GPP TS 52.402 [22].
## 5.3 Plug & Measure
To be completed in a later Release.
## 5.4 Measurement jobs
Measurement jobs may be only visible at the (proprietary) interface between
the EM and the NE. Measurement job administration functions in the EM may hide
the measurement jobs from the user interface by providing higher levels of
abstraction for the benefit of ease of use.
When defining a measurement job, the following aspects have to be considered.
### 5.4.1 Measurement job characteristics
#### 5.4.1.1 Measurement types
Every measurement job consists of one or more measurement types (as defined in
Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432 [29]), for which
it collects measurement data. The measurement type(s) contained in a job may
apply to one or more network resources of the same type, e.g. a measurement
job may be related to one or several NodeB(s). A measurement job will only
produce results for the measurement type(s) it contains.
#### 5.4.1.2 Measurement sub-types
Many of the measurement types specified produce single result values, i.e. the
measurement is characterised by a single measurement type as specified in TS
52.402 [22], TS 32.405 [32], TS 32.406 [33], TS 32.407 [34], TS 32.408 [35],
TS 32.409 [36], TS 32.425 [37], TS 32.426 [38], TS 32.452 [39] , TS.32.453
[40] , TS 28.402 [41] and TS 28.403 [42]. In other cases, however, the event
or procedure being measured can be characterised by several sub-types, or,
depending on the measurement definition, by several causes, e.g. successful
termination of a procedure and unsuccessful termination for all failure
causes. As far as a measurement type is defined to capture per cause
information of the event or procedure being measured, the causes and cause
codes are specified in \"other\" 3GPP TSs, i.e. in the TS defining the
procedure being measured. In other cases, the sub-types are specified in the
measurement type definitions in TS 52.402 [22], TS 32.405 [32], TS 32.406
[33], TS 32.407 [34], TS 32.408 [35], TS 32.409 [36], TS 32.425 [37], TS
32.426 [38], TS 32.452 [39] ,TS.32.453 [40] , TS 28.402 [41] and TS 28.403
[42]. For UMTS systems, combined UMTS/GSM systems and for LTE systems, this
information is described in detail in the measurement definition templates,
see TS 32.404 [31].
Per cause measurements, where the causes are defined in the 3GPP TS that
specifies the procedure or event being measured, may lead in certain cases to
a huge number of measurement sub-types which will increase substantially the
size of the measurement result file. Since not all per cause measurements may
be useful for the system operator, two options are possible for the management
of the corresponding measurement sub-types:
  * support all the sub-types corresponding to the cause codes defined in the 3GPP TS that specifies the procedure or event being measured. In that case, the sum over the result values of all supported per cause measurements is equal to the total sum across all defined sub-types, and therefore no sum value shall be provided in the measurement result files.
  * support only a subset of the causes (allowed only if the cause codes are specified in \"other\" 3GPP TSs). In that case, the first value of the result sequence in the measurement result files must be the total sum across all the sub-types as defined in the \"other\" 3GPP TS, which may then be different from the sum over the result values of the supported sub-types. The keyword ._sum_ placed behind the measurement type is used to identify the sum subtype.
If the definition of a measurement refers to specific failure causes or other
sub-types then care shall be taken to assess which causes or sub-types are
included. The choice of the supported causes/sub-types in the above cases is
manufacturer dependent. Measurement job administration in the EM may also
allow the system operators to select the sub-types of the measurement types
that make up the measurement job, otherwise all sub-types supported by an
implementation are included.
#### 5.4.1.3 Measurement schedule
The measurement schedule specifies the time frames during which the
measurement job will be active. The measurement job is active as soon as the
starttime - if supplied in the schedule - is reached. The system shall support
a job starttime of up to at least 30 days from the job creation date. If no
starttime is provided, the measurement job shall become active immediately.
The measurement job remains active until the stoptime - if supplied in the
schedule - is reached. If no job stoptime is specified the measurement job
will run indefinitely and can only be stopped by EM intervention, i.e. by
deleting or suspending the measurement job.
The time frame defined by the measurement schedule may contain one or more
recording intervals. These recording intervals may repeat on a daily and/or
weekly basis and specify the time periods during which the measurement data is
collected within the NE. A recording interval is identified by an interval
starttime and an interval endtime, which lie between 00.00 and 24.00 hours,
aligned on granularity period boundaries. Thus the length of a recording
interval will be a multiple of the granularity period. For a single
measurement type it shall be possible to specify several measurement jobs with
different recording intervals as long as these intervals do not overlap. If it
is required that a measurement type be observed by multiple measurement jobs
with overlapping schedules then the system shall support multiple instances of
that measurement type.
#### 5.4.1.4 Granularity period
The granularity period is the time between the initiation of two successive
gatherings of measurement data.\ Valid values for the granularity period are 5
minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour. The minimum granularity period is 5
minutes in most cases, but for some measurements it may only make sense to
collect data in a larger granularity period. The granularity period shall be
synchronised on the full hour, but its value is not required to be changeable
during the lifetime of the job.
#### 5.4.1.5 Measurement reporting
Each measurement job running on an NE produces scheduled measurement reports
(measurement records) at the end of each granularity period, and contains the
information as requested by the system operator. This information consists of:
\- an identification of the measurement job that generated the report;
\- an identification of the involved measurement type(s) and the measured
network resource(s) (e.g. NodeB);
\- a time stamp, referring to the end of the granularity period;
\- for each measurement type, the result value(s) and an indication of the
validity of the result value(s);
\- an indication if the scan is not complete, and the reason why the scan
could not be completed.
The exact layout of the measurement reports (measurement records) generated by
the NEs may be vendor specific. Multiple measurement reports shall be
collated, based on reporting period, into a measurement result file for
transfer, e.g from the NE or the EM. The file format of this aggregated file
is specified by Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432
[29]. Clause 5.5.2 specifies how these reports can be transferred to the
destination EM and/or NM.
#### 5.4.1.6 Illustration of the measurement scheduling principles
The diagram below gives an example of a NE which runs a measurement job, with
a 15 minute granularity period, that has a recording interval start and end
time, respectively, of 12:00 and 14:00.
Figure 2
\- At 12:00 the measurement job starts collecting data for its defined
measurements.
\- At 12:15, and every 15 minutes during the Recording Interval, the results
for the measurements will be computed from the data gathered over the previous
15 minutes, and measurement reporting occurs as specified in clause 5.3.1.4.
\- Beginning at 12:15, the results for the expired granularity periods may be
sent to a destination OS.
\- At 14:00 the measurement job activity is terminated for this recording
interval.
### 5.4.2 Measurement job state and status attributes
Void.
### 5.4.3 Measurement job administration
Measurement jobs can be administered by the EM according to the following
stipulations.
**Creating a measurement job:** On creation of a measurement job, all
information has to be supplied in order to collect the required data from the
selected network resources as specified by the measurement job characteristics
(see clause 5.4.1).
**Modifying a measurement job:** In general, the modification of measurement
job parameters may be requested by the EM during the lifetime of a measurement
job when the job is suspended (explained below).
**Displaying a measurement job:** The system operator shall be able to get a
list of all measurements that are currently defined, together with all
available actual information as stored in the NE. This information consists of
the data that is supplied on creation/modification and the actual state and
status information of the measurement job.
**Deleting a measurement job:** A measurement job is automatically deleted by
the system when it reaches the job endtime and all scheduled measurement
reports have been generated. A created measurement job can also be deleted by
manual intervention at any time. When deleted, the measurement process
associated with the job is stopped, and all allocated resources are freed.
**Suspending/resuming a measurement job:** On normal operation, the
measurement job collects measurement data within the NE according to the
actual values of the measurement job parameters. However, the system operator
may decide for some reason to discard temporarily the collection of
measurement data (e.g. in case of system overload or congestion, measurement
results temporarily not used,...). The system operator therefore is able to
suspend a defined measurement job at any time. This implies that the
measurement job definition remains in the system, but that no measurement
gathering activities are performed for this job. When the measurement job is
resumed, measurement data collection is started again at the next granularity
period within the measurement schedule. In addition to the suspend operation
which may be triggered by the operator, the system may selectively suspend one
or more measurement jobs in case of overload. When a measurement job is
suspended, a "job suspended" notification shall then be generated so that the
Network Manager(s) will be warned of such an event.
## 5.5 Measurement results
### 5.5.1 Measurement result characteristics
During its specified recording intervals, each measurement job produces a
result at the end of the granularity period if it is not suspended.
Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432 [29] provides
for each measurement type that is specified within the present document a
description of the expected measurement result.
Measurement results for all measurements of a particular measurement job are
gathered in a single report at the end of the granularity period. The report
may contain - in addition to the specific measurement results \- fixed
information, which is global for all measurement results associated with that
measurement job, such as an identification of the involved network resources
and a time stamp referring to the time at which the NE started collecting the
measurement results. If measurement results are sent to the EM then the exact
format may be vendor specific. For details about the standard file format for
the transfer of measurement results to the NM via Itf-N Performance
Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432 [29].
Once the result reports have been generated, they shall be stored locally
within the NE if so requested by the EM/system operator. The storage capacity
and duration as well as the method how the data may be deleted from the NE
will be implementation dependent.
If some or all of the requested measurement data cannot be collected by a
measurement job, this shall be indicated in the measurement report, cf. clause
5.4.1.5. In extreme cases, no report at all can be generated by the
measurement job. This means that the destination of the result report (EM
and/or NM) shall be capable of coping with missing or incomplete measurement
reports.
### 5.5.2 Transfer of measurement results
During the recording intervals specified for a measurement job, scheduled
measurement reports are generated at the end of each granularity period if the
measurement job is not suspended. These reports can be transferred to the EM
in either of two ways:
1) immediate notifications:
\- the reports are automatically forwarded to the EM at the end of the
granularity period.
2) deferred retrieval:
\- the reports are stored locally in the NE, where they can be retrieved when
required.
For each individual report, the transfer of measurement results in either one
or both ways is to be established by the system operator, i.e. under the
control of the EM. The actual control of the result transfer and the
mechanisms applied may be implementation specific.
Each implementation shall support a file transfer facility to an external OS
(i.e. not supplied by the NE vendor), such as an NM. This facility shall be
implemented using either the FTAM ISO 8751 [7], (T)FTP protocol or
FTIRP([30]). This interface may be located either in the NEs or the EM, as
chosen by the vendor. As a result, it may not at all be necessary to transfer
measurement result reports to the EM, if:
\- the NM interface is implemented in the NEs, and
\- the Operator chooses to post-process measurement results only in the NM.
Details of the file format to be used on the NM interface can be found in
Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432 [29]. The
measurement report file conventions and transfer procedure are also specified
in Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432 [29].
The results of the measurement job can be forwarded to the EM in either of two
standard ways:
1) the scheduled result reports generated by the NE (notifications) can be
sent to the EM as soon as they are available;
2) the reports can be stored in the NE (files) and transferred to or retrieved
by the EM when required.
It shall be possible for the EM to specify the details for its result
retrieval as a part of the measurement administration.
Measurement results can be forwarded to the NM via a bulk transfer interface.
It is an implementation option whether this interface resides in the EM or the
NEs. Depending on the implementation, the control of the bulk transfer of
measurement results to the NM may involve the EM and/or the NM. See
Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432 [29] for
details.
In a network with more than one OS (e.g. EM and NM) the data produced may be
required by several OSs. It is therefore necessary to support the possibility
for multiple destinations for transfer of data.
All scenarios for the result transfer, as far as they are relevant for
standardisation of 3G systems, are defined above. It should be noted that,
depending on an Operator\'s needs, measurement results may have to be
transferred to the EM only, the NM only, or both. Depending on a vendor\'s
implementation, measurement results may be transferred to the NM directly from
the NE or via the EM. This implies that not all of the result transfer options
described above shall be implemented in all cases, however, those procedures
that are implemented shall comply with the present document. A detailed
specification of the measurement result transfer to the NM can be found in
Performance Measurement File Format Definition 3GPP TS 32.432 [29].
## 5.6 Usage of Alarm IRP for performance alarms
Performance alarms allow Network Operators to be quickly informed of
significant PM-related events. Authorized users can (a) set the measurement
thresholds and (b) define the characteristics of related performance alarm
notifications (e.g. perceivedSeverity). (a) Crossing or (b) reaching of
thresholds shall result in the emission of a performance alarm notification.
Performance alarms may be defined against any managed object supporting
measurement definitions, e.g. UtranCell, SgsnFunction. The source object of
the performance alarm shall be the source object instance of the measurement
that caused the alarm. Upon threshold (a) crossing or (b) reaching, the
subscribed users (i.e. Notification IRP Managers) shall be notified via the
Alarm IRP and Notification IRP. The Alarm IRP and Notification IRP are
described in TS 32.111-2 [21] and TS 32.302 [11].
All parameters of the alarm notification as described in TS 32.111-2 [21] can
be used for performance alarms. This information shall be provided by the PM
application as the user of the Alarm IRP, with respect to at least the event
type, probable cause, perceived severity, and thresholdinfo, plus all other
user supplied mandatory parameters of the alarm notification. The parameter
thresholdinfo shall be present for all performance alarm notifications and
shall contain information pertinent to the context in which the performance
alarm was triggered.
The thresholdinfo parameter shall provide the following information:
  * The identifier of the measurement which (a) crossed or (b) reached the threshold
  * The value of the measurement
  * The threshold (a) crossing or (b) reaching direction (up or down)
  * The threshold value (if hysteresis thresholds are supported, both raise and clear trigger values are provided)
Once a performance alarm has been raised, it shall be managed as other kinds
of alarms, e.g., acknowledged, unacknowledged or annotated. Performance alarms
may not be cleared manually (i.e., via the ADMC [automatic detection and
manual clearing], see 3GPP TS 32.111-1\" [12]). Performance alarms shall be
cleared when the threshold is (a) crossed or (b) reached in the opposite
direction to the one that triggers the alarm.
## 5.7 Threshold Management
To be able to monitor the overall health of the network, authorized users will
have to set the thresholds used for generating Performance Alarms (see section
5.6). It is the Operator's responsibility to ensure that threshold values are
defined appropriately in order to detect performance degradations before they
become service affecting.
An alarm threshold may be defined for one or more instances of a managed
object class supporting measurements. The threshold will be monitored based on
a monitor granularity period, where the monitor granularity period is a
multiple of measurements collection granularity period. Following threshold
creation, it shall be possible to query the threshold information defined for
an object instance.
The threshold definition shall allow the user to assign up to four different
severity levels (critical, major, minor, warning) based on different threshold
values. The threshold direction should also be defined as increasing or
decreasing, according to which direction raises the Performance Alarm. More
generally, any Performance Management specific parameters of the triggered
alarm notification as described in TS 32.111-2 [21] will be specified within
the threshold configuration information.
All performance measurement types are available for threshold management. When
defining thresholds, the user shall be able to select from any of the
performance measurement types relevant for the object instance to which the
threshold applies.
Thresholds are evaluated as performance data become available. For each
measurement type, the current value is checked against the defined alarm
threshold(s). Depending upon the previous value for this measurement type, a
new alarm, a changed alarm or a clear alarm may be raised upon the (a)
crossing or (b) reaching of this threshold.
The behaviour of performance alarms shall be the same as that of the AlarmIRP
([21]).
The threshold value for cumulative counters should be a rate of variation
defined in an independent way of the monitor granularity period, e.g. an alarm
could be triggered when PDP context activation requests are received at a rate
exceeding 20 requests/s.
The following figure describes examples of threshold crossing for a Cumulative
Counter measurement type in the context the changed alarm is supported:
  * At T1, a new alarm notification A1 (minor) is generated when Level 1 is crossed
  * At T2, a changed alarm notification A1 (critical) is generated when Level 2 and 3 are crossed
  * At T3, a changed alarm notification A1 (minor) is generated when Level 3 and 2 are crossed
  * At T4, a cleared alarm notification A1 is generated when Level 1 is crossed
Figure 3: Examples of rate-based threshold crossings for a CC measurement type
For **gauge** measurements, the observed value of a gauge at the end of the
monitor granularity period is compared to the threshold value.
The following figure describes examples of threshold crossing for a Gauge
measurement type in the context the changed alarm is supported:
  * At T1, a new alarm notification A1 (minor) is generated when Level 1 is crossed
  * At T2, a changed alarm notification A1 (major) is generated when Level 2 is crossed
  * At T3, a cleared alarm notification A1 is generated when Level 2 and 1 are crossed
Figure 4: Examples of threshold crossing for a Gauge measurement type
In order to avoid repeatedly triggering Performance Alarms around a particular
threshold level, an hysteresis mechanism may also be provided by defining
threshold levels in pairs (high levels and low levels). In that case, the high
level value shall be greater than or equal to the low level value.
For each pair of high and low threshold levels, one of them shall generate an
alarm notification, and the other shall generate an alarm clear notification.
If the direction of the threshold is increasing, a new alarm will not be
generated before the measurement value has (a) crossed or (b) reached the high
level threshold value. Furthermore, the alarm will not be cleared before the
measurement value has reached the low level threshold value. For decreasing
thresholds, the opposite is applied. The alarm notification shall always be
generated before the alarm clear notification. The hysteresis mechanism can be
used for both Gauges and Cumulative Counters thresholds.
The following figure describes examples of threshold crossings with hysteresis
for a Gauge measurement type in the context the changed alarm is supported:
  * At T1, a new alarm notification A1 (e.g. minor) is generated when notifyHigh1 is reached
  * At T2, a changed alarm notification A1 (e.g. major) is generated when notifyHigh2 is reached
  * At T3, a changed alarm notification A1(e.g. minor) is generated when notifyLow2 is reached
  * At T4, a cleared alarm notification A1 is generated when notifyLow1 is reached
  * At T5, a new alarm notification A2 is generated when notifyHigh1 is reached
Figure 5: Examples of threshold crossings with hysteresis for a Gauge
measurement type
For a threshold crossing with hysteresis example of Cumulative Counter
measurement type, the monitored value for the alarms generation would be the
derivative of the CC value, i.e. its rate of variation.
For DER and SI, the value of the counter will be calculated over the complete
monitor granularity period. For **SI,** the counter will be sampled at regular
time intervals and the mean value over the monitor granularity period will be
calculated and compared with the threshold. For DER type, the threshold is
compared with the mean value of all observations collected during the monitor
granularity period. For a **DER** type, if no observations are made during the
monitor granularity period then the DER will have a value of NULL. No valid
comparison with a threshold can be made in this case. If an alarm has
previously been detected it will remain outstanding.
The following figure describes examples of threshold crossings for a DER
measurement type in the context the changed alarm is supported:
  * At T1, a new alarm notification A1 (minor) is generated when Level 1 is crossed
  * At T2, a changed alarm notification A1 (major) is generated when Level 2 is crossed
  * At T3, a cleared alarm notification A1 is generated when Level 1 is crossed
