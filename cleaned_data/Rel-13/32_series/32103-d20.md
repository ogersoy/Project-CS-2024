# Introduction
This specification provides the IRP Overview for 3GPP specifications,
addressing Interface IRPs, NRM IRPs, Measurement / Trace /SON specifications,
as well as their relationships with each other.
# 1 Scope
The present document gives an overview about 3GPP\'s management interface
capabilities and related functionality.\ It provides high-level information
about IRP Framework, available IRPs as well as their relationship with each
other. This document is intended to be a guide into the world of 3GPP
management specifications, enabling also non-subject matter experts to gain an

# 4 IRP Framework
## 4.1 Introduction
For the purpose of management interface development 3GPP has developed an
interface concept known as Integration Reference Point (IRP) to promote the
wider adoption of standardized management interfaces in telecommunication
networks. The IRP concept and associated methodology employs model-driven
development, protocol and technology neutral modelling methods as well as
protocol specific solution sets to achieve its goals.

## 4.2 IRP Framework Highlights
### 4.2.1 IRP Concept
IRP specifications are specified using a 3-level approach: Requirements, IS-
level and SS-level.
{width="6.426388888888889in" height="3.6597222222222223in"}
Figure 4.2-1: The IRP 3-Level Specifications Approach combined with the three
IRP categories [2].
**Requirements-level:**
The \"Requirements-level\" intends to provide conceptual and use cases
definitions for a specific management interface aspect as well as defining
subsequent requirements for this IRP.
**IS-level:**
The \"IS-level\" provides the technology independent specification of an IRP.
**SS-level:**
The \"SS-level\" finally provides the mapping of IS definitions into one or
more technology-specific Solution Sets. This concept provides support for
multiple interface technologies as applicable on a vendor and/or network type
basis and also enables accommodation of future interface technologies -
without the need to redefine requirements and IS-level definitions.
### 4.2.2 Relationships between IRPs
There are three categories of IRP specifications:
\- Interface IRPs
\- NRM IRPs
\- Data Definition IRPs
Each category is partitioned into Requirements, IS-level and SS-level
specifications.
Relationships between various kinds of IRPs:
\- Some Interface IRPs and NRM IRPs are used together. Such Interface IRPs
operate on entities modelled by NRM IRPs. For example, operations defined in
Basic CM IRP are used together with E- UTRAN NRM IRP to support E-UTRAN
configuration management function.
\- Interface IRPs are network/radio technology independent and can operate on
entities modelled by NRM IRPs of different network technologies. For example,
operations defined in Basic CM IRP are used together with E- UTRAN NRM IRP or
UTRAN NRM IRP to support E- UTRAN or UTRAN configuration management functions.
\- Interface IRPs are Converged Management ready (e.g. support management of
fixed and/or mobile) and can operate on modelled mobile and/or fixed network
entities.
\- A Data Definition IRP provides common data definitions, referenced by
specifications of Interface IRPs and NRM IRPs.

### 4.2.3 IRP Development Principles
**NRM IRP Extendibility** \- Enabling Technology, Organizational & Vendor-
specific NRM extensions via
  * Rule-based NRM Extensions (e.g. Sub-classing)
  * vsDataContainer
**Interface IRP Flexibility** \- Enabling: wide applicability, phased
introduction capabilities & broad industry adoption (not just for wireless)
via
  * Flexible use of qualifiers \"mandatory\", \"optional\", \"conditional\" for operation, notifications and/or parameters
  * NRM/Technology-neutrality & avoiding competing procedures
### 4.2.4 IRP Specification Structure

\- 28.750-28.769: Service-related NRM IRPs.
_\- 28.770-28.799: reserved for future topic NRM IRPs._
### 4.2.5 Essential IRP Definitions [2]
**Data Definition IRP:** 3GPP publishes IRP specifications relating to
commonly used data definitions that can be imported for use by Interface IRP
and/or NRM IRP. This term represents all such specifications. An example of a
Data Definition IRP is the State Management IRP (32.671 [102], 32.672 [103],
32.676 [103], etc).
**Integration Reference Point (IRP):** An architectural concept that is
described by a set of specifications for definition of a certain aspect of a
management interface, comprising a **Requirements** specification, an
**Information Service** specification, and one or more **Solution Set**
specifications.
**Interface IRP:** 3GPP publishes a number of IRP specifications each of which
is related to a set of operations and notifications for a specific telecom
management domain such as alarm management, configuration management, etc.
Interface IRPs also contain definitions of Support IOCs. This term represents
all such specifications. An example of an Interface IRP is the Basic CM IRP
(the set of TSs 32.601 [88], 32.602 [89], 32.606 [90], etc.).
**IRPAgent:** Encapsulates a well-defined subset of network (element)
functions. It interacts with IRPManagers using one or more IRPs. From the
IRPManager\'s perspective, the IRPAgent behaviour is only visible via the
IRP(s).
**Information Service (IS):** an IRP Information Service describes the
information related to the entities (either network resources or support
objects) to be managed and the way that the information may be managed for a
certain functional area (e.g. the Alarm IRP Information Service in the fault
management area). Information Services are defined for all IRPs.
**IRPManager:** Models a user of IRPAgent(s) and it interacts directly with
the IRPAgent(s) using IRP(s).\ Since the IRPManager represents an IRPAgent
user, it gives a clear picture of what the IRPAgent is supposed to do. From
the IRPAgent perspective, the IRPManager behaviour is only visible via the
IRP.
**Network Resource Model (NRM):** An Information Service describing
Information Object Classes representing the manageable aspects of network
resources, e.g. an RNC or NodeB.
**NRM IRP:** 3GPP publishes a number of IRP specifications each of which is
related to a particular NRM (Network Resource Model) as defined in 3GPP TS
32.101 [3]. NRM IRPs do not define any operations or notifications. This term
represents all such specifications. Note: In some NRM IRP titles, for historic
reasons, they are named \"network resources IRP\"). An example of an NRM IRP
is the Generic NRM IRP (32.621 [94], 32.622 [95], 32.626 [96], etc.).
**Solution Set (SS):** contains a mapping of the IRP Information Service (IS)
defined entities (that are technology-agnostic) to technology specific termed
entities. It does not contain specification of the entities\' semantics. The
semantics can be found in the corresponding IS. It is noted that one IS can be
mapped to one or several SSs.
## 4.3 IRP related High-level Requirements & Architecture Specifications
The IRP Framework has been developed in response to management requirements
documented in the following specifications:
\- 32.101 [3]: Principles and high level requirements
\- 32.102 [4]: Architecture
\- 32.107 [160]: Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) Federated Network Information
Model (FNIM)
\- 32.111-1 [5]: 3G fault management requirements
\- 32.140 [11],32.141[12]: SuM requirements / SuM architecture
\- 32.300 [20]: Name convention for Managed Objects
\- 32.401 [48]: PM Concept and requirements
\- 32.500 [74]: SON Concepts and requirements
\- 32.511 [78]: ANR management Concepts and requirements
\- 32.521 [79]: Self-optimization Concepts and requirements
\- 32.541 [85]: Self-healing Concepts and requirements
\- 32.551 [86]: Energy Saving Management (ESM) Concepts and requirements
\- 32.600 [87]: CM Concept and high-level requirements
## 4.4 Converged Management and IRPs
As outlined in previous sections, 3GPP Interface IRPs are network-technology-
independent, and therefore can be utilized for the management of various
network technologies.
To further ease converged management (the common management of multiple
network technologies) and to address the need for OPEX reduction, 3GPP
together with other industry organizations (i.e. NGMN and TM Forum) developed
jointly the following specifications:
\- Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) Federated Network Information Model (FNIM)
(published in 3GPP as TS 32.107[160])
\- Defining conceptually the federated network information model and the
relationships between participating models (see also section 5.5 of TS 32.101
[3]).
\- FMC FNIM Umbrella Information Model (UIM) (published in 3GPP as TS
28.620[114])
\- Providing abstract definitions of information objects applicable across
Domain/Technology-specific Concrete Models.
\- Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) Model repertoire (published in 3GPP as TS
32.156[18])
\- Defining meta definitions for models supporting converged management.
\- Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) 3GPP / TM Forum Concrete Model Relationships
and Use Cases .
\- Proposing the specific structure of model and realisation of that structure
across 3GPP and TM Forum by taking advantage of current TM Forum transport-
oriented model work (SID, MTNM/MTOSI) as well as current 3GPP SA5 mobile-
oriented model work (NRM IRPs etc.).
Based on above, 3GPP has applied definitions provided by these specifications
by creating the 28-series variants of the 3GPP NRM IRPs to support converged
management.

# 8 Relationships between IRPs
Relationships between Interface IRPs:
\- All Interface IRPs utilizing the functionality of the Generic IRP
\- All Notification emitting Interface IRPs utilizing the functionality of the
Notification IRP
Relationships between NRM IRPs:
\- For FMC-enabled NRM IRP, the Generic NRM IRP is utilizing functionality of
the FMC FNIM Umbrella Information Model (UIM)
\- All NRM IRPs utilizing the functionality of the Generic NRM IRP
\- All function-specific NRM IRPs (e.g. Core NRM IRP) utilizing the
functionality of the Inventory NRM IRP
# 9 SON functions
In order to reduce the operating expenses (OPEX) associated with the
management of increasing number of nodes from more than one vendor the concept
of the Self-Organizing Network (SON) was introduced. Automation of some
network planning, configuration and optimisation processes via the use of SON
functions can help the network operator to reduce OPEX by reducing manual
involvement in such tasks.
SON functions are Radio Access Technology (RAT) dependent. Generally, SON
functions are applicable to E-UTRAN network, and can be applied to UTRAN
network on a case by case basis. Currently the following specifications have
identified the use cases and requirements in context of SON for
standardization:
\- Self-establishment of an eNodeB: Related requirements are defined in TS
32.501 **[75]** ;
\- Automatic Neighbour Relation Management: Related requirements are defined
in TS 32.511 [78];
\- Self-Optimisation Management: Related requirements are defined in TS 32.521
[79] or TS 28.627 [118];
\- Self-Healing Management: Related requirements are defined in TS 32.541
[85];
\- Energy Saving Management: Related requirements are defined in TS 32.551
[86];
\- Minimization of Drive Tests: Related requirements are defined in TS 32.421
[58]and TS 32.441 [66].
Each SON use case can involve multiple IRPs when corresponding management
scenarios are applied. As to IRP solution fulfilment, Self-Optimization
Management, Self-Healing Management and Energy Saving Management share the
common information model of SON policy NRM (TS 32.522 [80]), while each one
also has RAT-dependent information model in E-UTRAN NRM (TS 32.761 [108],
32.762 [109], 32.766 [110] /28.657 [130], 28.658 [131], 28.659 [132]) or UTRAN

28.653 [126]). The IRP relationships of SON functions and measurement
definitions are addressed case by case as follows,

# B.2 Network sharing management support table
There are several use cases and scenarios for network sharing. Table B.2-1
identifies the list of specifications and the status of support with regards
to network sharing that satisfy the 3GPP Stage 1 requirements as defined in
the present document.
Legend used in the table:
**\- Not Applicable (N/A):** \ The specification is not relevant to network
sharing: example TS 32.581, TS 32.582.
**\- Not supported: Not supported and no proposal to modify in this
release:\** Needs modifications but might/will not be changed in this release.
**\- Not required in this release:** The network sharing scenarios and
requirements in the present document do not require support in **this
release**.
**\- Supported in this release:\** Specification modified to support network
sharing scenarios.
**\- Supported with no modification:** \ The specification supports network
sharing scenarios with no modifications. Examples are generic NRM.\ Even
though this NRM is needed for supporting configuration management for a shared
node, there is no change needed to the specification.
**-** **TBD** : Evaluation in progress.
NOTE: Table B.2-1 is a skeleton and will be populated as the network sharing
work is progressing.
> The intention of table B.2-1 is to cover all the SA5 Technical
> Specifications (TS) with an evaluation remark on support for network
> sharing. If a TS does not appear in the table, it implies that the TS has
> not been evaluated for impact to support network sharing.
