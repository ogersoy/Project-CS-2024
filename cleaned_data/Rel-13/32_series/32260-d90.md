# 1 Scope
The present document is part of a series of Technical Specifications (TSs)
that specify charging functionality and charging management in GSM/UMTS
networks. The GSM/UMTS core network charging architecture and principles are
specified in document TS 32.240 [1], which provides an umbrella for other
charging management documents that specify:
\- the content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging),
\- the content of real-time charging events per domain / subsystem (online
charging);
\- the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains and
subsystems;
\- the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the
charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).
The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240 [1].
The present document specifies the offline and online charging description for
the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), based on the functional descriptions of the
IMS in TS 23.228 [200]. This charging description includes the offline and
online charging architecture and scenarios specific to IMS, as well as the
mapping of common 3GPP charging architecture specified in TS 32.240 [1] onto
IMS. It further specifies the structure and content of the CDRs for offline
charging, and the charging events for online charging. The present document is
related to other 3GPP charging TSs as follows:
\- The common 3GPP charging architecture is specified in TS 32.240 [1];
\- The parameters, abstract syntax and encoding rules for these CDR types are
specified in TS 32.298 [51].
\- A transaction based mechanism for the transfer of CDRs within the network
is specified in TS 32.295 [54].
\- The file based mechanism used to transfer the CDRs from the network to the
operator\'s billing domain (e.g. the billing system or a mediation device) is
specified in TS 32.297 [52].
\- The 3GPP Diameter application that is used for IMS offline and online
charging is specified in TS 32.299 [50].
All terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the present document, that
are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in the 3GPP Vocabulary, TR 21.905
[100]. Those that are common across charging management in GSM/UMTS domains,
services or subsystems are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240 [1] and
are copied into clause 3 of the present document for ease of reading. Finally,
those items that are specific to the present document are defined exclusively
in the present document.
Furthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in TS
22.115 [101].

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 [100], TS 32.240 [1], and the following apply. A term
defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the
same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [100].
**billing:** function whereby CDRs generated by the charging function are
transformed into bills requiring payment.
**Billing Domain:** Part of the operator network, which is outside the core
network that receives and processes charging information from the core network
charging functions. It includes functions that can provide billing mediation
and billing end applications.
**charged party:** user involved in a chargeable event that has to pay parts
or the whole charges of the chargeable event, or a third party paying the
charges caused by one or all users involved in the chargeable event, or a
network operator.
**charging:** function whereby information related to a chargeable event is
formatted and transferred in order to make it possible to determine usage for
which the charged party may be billed.
**Charging Data Record (CDR):** record generated by a Network Element for the
purpose of billing a subscriber for the provided service. It includes fields
identifying the user, the session and the Network Elements as well as
information on the network resources and services used to support a subscriber
session. In the traditional circuit domain, CDR has been used to denote \"Call
Detail Record\", which is subsumed by \"Charging Data Record\" hereafter.
**charging function:** entity inside the core network domain, subsystem or
service that is involved in charging for that domain, subsystem or service.
**offline charging:** charging mechanism where charging information **does
not** affect, in real-time, the service rendered
**online charging:** charging mechanism where charging information can affect,
in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the
charging mechanism with session/service control is required
**partial CDR:** CDR that provides information on part of a subscriber
session. A long session may be covered by several partial CDRs. Two formats
are considered for Partial CDRs. One that contains all of the necessary
fields; the second has a reduced format.

# 5 Charging principles
## 5.1 IMS charging principles
### 5.1.0 Introduction
The IMS Network Elements shall maintain the integrity of all received or
created charging-related information when forwarding the information to the
offline and online charging systems, whatever the length of the value of any
particular parameter is. For example, the IMS Charging Identifier (ICID) may
be generated by one IMS Network Element (e.g. the P-CSCF) and forwarded to
another IMS Network Element (e.g. the S-CSCF). Both may generate charging
information and ensure that the data integrity is maintained, in order to make
possible correlation based on the ICID.
### 5.1.1 IMS charging applicability
The AS and MRFC are able to distinguish whether to apply offline or online
charging, i.e. whether to send charging information over the Rf interface to
the CDF or over the Ro interface to the OCS, which includes ECF and SCF as
described in clause 4.3 (or to use both). The decision of which interface to
use is based on the information (CDF and/or OCS address) the AS/MRFC receives
in the SIP signalling and the system configuration as provisioned by the
operator. If the AS/MRFC only receive the CDF address and do not receive an
OCS address then they use only the Rf interface. If only the OCS address was
provided then they use only the Ro interface. In cases where both CDF and OCS
addresses are provided it is possible to use both interfaces simultaneously.
However, operators may overrule the addresses received via the SIP signalling
and use their own configured rules instead. Operators may configure locally on
the AS/MRFC an OCS and/or CDF address. The choice of whether the IMS Network
Elements use locally configured addresses or the addresses received by SIP
signalling, and the decision on which interface(s) to use, is left for
operator configuration.
All other IMS Network Elements (S-CSCF, P-CSCF, I-CSCF, BGCF, IBCF, and MGCF)
apply offline charging via the Rf interface using the CDF address as received
via SIP signalling or the locally configured CDF address in the IMS Network
Element. The S-CSCF supports online charging using:
the ISC interface, i.e. if the Application Server addressed over ISC is the
IMS Gateway Function, or
the Ro interface directly instead of the ISC, if the IMS Gateway Function is
integrated within the S-CSCF.
The offline and online charging function addresses transferred in SIP
signalling are encoded in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses as defined in TS
24.229 [204] and RFC 7315 [406]. The P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
contains the following parameters: CCF (i.e. CDF) and ECF (i.e. OCS).
### 5.1.2 IMS charging correlation
#### 5.1.2.1 Basic principles for IMS domain correlation
The IMS charging correlation information is encoded in the SIP P-Charging-
Vector header as defined in the following sub clauses. The P-Charging-Vector
header contains the following parameters: ICID, access network charging
identifier and IOI.
The loopback-indication parameter identify when loopback apply.
General correlation mechanisms are defined in TS 32.240 [1], and further
details about the usage of P-Charging-Vector are defined in TS 24.229 [204],
TS 24.292 [210], and IETF RFC 7315 [406].
The enhanced MSC server for ICS charging in this specification refers the MSC
server which performs IMS registration, as defined in TS 23.292 [219]. The
enhanced MSC server for SRVCC charging in this specification refers the MSC
server defined in TS 24.237 [217].
#### 5.1.2.2 IMS Charging Identifier
The IMS domain correlation is based on IMS Charging Identifier (ICID) shared
between IMS Network Elements involved with the same session/transaction. With
ICID it is possible to correlate session/transaction related charging data
generated in different IMS elements (i.e. x-CSCFs, ASs\'). The ICID is
included in all SIP methods, if the P-Charging-Vector header is present, and
transferred through originating and terminating side nodes, except to UE.
The value of the ICID parameter is identical with the \'icid-value\' parameter
defined in TS 24.229 [204]. The \'icid-value\' is a mandatory part of the
P-Charging-Vector and coded as a text-based UTF-8 charset (as are all SIP
messages). For further information regarding the composition and usage of the
P-Charging-Vector refer to [204] and RFC 7315 [406].
The ICID value is globally unique across all 3GPP IMS networks for a time
period of at least one month, implying that neither the node that generated
this ICID nor any other IMS Network Element reuse this value before the
uniqueness period expires. The one month minimum uniqueness period counts from
the time of release of the ICID, i.e. the ICID value no longer being used.
This can be achieved by using node specific information, e.g. high-granularity
time information and / or topology / location information. The exact method
how to achieve the uniqueness requirement is an implementation issue.
At each SIP session unrelated method, both initial and subsequent (e.g. SIP
REGISTER, SIP NOTIFY, SIP MESSAGE etc.), a new, session unrelated ICID is
generated at the first IMS Network Element that processes the method. This
ICID value is contained in the SIP request and SIP response of that SIP
transaction and must be valid for the duration of the transaction.
At each SIP session establishment a new, session specific ICID is generated at
the first IMS Network Element that processes the session-initiating SIP INVITE
message. Enhanced MSC server will generate an ICID for ICS and SRVCC
originated calls as described in TS 24.229 [204]. This ICID is then used in
all subsequent SIP messages for that session (e.g., SIP 200 OK, SIP
(RE-)INVITE, SIP BYE etc.) until the session is terminated.
#### 5.1.2.2A Related ICID
During the process of SRVCC access transfer, the Enhanced MSC server or the
P-CSCF generates an ICID for the target access leg. For the purpose of
charging correlation between the source access leg and the target access leg
when the user is roaming the SCC AS and the ATCF includes the ICID used on the
source access leg as the Related ICID for the target access leg as described
in TS 24.229 [204]. Alternatively, when OneChargingSession is applied in the
SCC AS and the ATCF, the ICID of the original access leg is preserved in the
AS/ATCF CDR for the whole duration of the session, and the Related ICID
contains the ICID used on the target access leg.
This Related ICID is sent in the 1xx and 2xx responses to the initial SIP
INVITE as described in TS 24.237 [217].
#### 5.1.2.3 Access network charging identifier
The access network charging identifier is the media flow level data shared
among the IMS Network Elements for one side of the session (either the
originating or terminating side). This information is used to correlate the
access network charging data with the IMS charging data.\ The access network
is identified by bearer specific correlation identifier, e.g. for Packet
Switched Access (GGSN address and PDP context Identifier) or Fixed Broadband
Access (Multimedia Charging Identifier). The access network charging
identifier is populated in the P-Charging-Vector using the access-network-
charging-info parameter. For further information regarding the composition and
usage of the access-network-charging-info parameter refer to TS 24.229[204]
and RFC 7315 [406].
#### 5.1.2.4 Inter Operator Identifier
The Inter Operator Identifier (IOI) identifies originating, terminating and
transit networks involved in a session/transaction. The IOI may be generated
from each side of session/transaction to identify the home networks associated
with each side. The Orig-IOI and Term-IOI parameters of P-Charging-Vector
represent the originating and terminating operator identifiers.
For interconnection scenarios in multi operator environments where one or more
transit operators are between the originating and terminating operator, a list
of Transit-IOI values may occur additionally to identify involved transit
operators. Due to operator policy, a transit operator may also hide his
identity by adding a void value. Addition and deletion of Transit-IOI values
are operator configurable. For further information regarding the composition
and usage of the parameters refer to TS 24.229[204], TS 24.292 [210], and IETF
RFC 7315 [406].
NOTE: No transit networks are expected between the S-CSCF and a 3^rd^ party
Application Server triggered by the initial filter criteria in the S-CSCF.
#### 5.1.2.5 Void
#### 5.1.2.6 IMS visited network identifier
The IMS visited network identifier identifies the visited network involved in
a session/transaction. The IMS visited network identifier is available in the
SIP P-Visited-Network-ID header of the SIP REGISTER and should be used for all
charging events associated with the user.
#### 5.1.2.7 Loopback-indication
During the loopback the TRF will set the Loopback-indication parameter to
identify when loopback applies. When the TRF receives responses to initial or
subsequent requests from the terminating side, the TRF inserts in the
P-Charging-Vector header field, if present, the \"loopback-indication\" header
field parameter to the outgoing response.
### 5.1.3 SDP handling
SDP information on SIP can have two different meanings; SDP offer or SDP
answer. This is captured in the charging information by a SDP-type parameter
that indicates if the SDP Media Component is an SDP offer or SDP answer. SDP
offers can be sent by either the calling or called party and the Media
Initiator Flag identifies who sent the first SDP offer in a SDP negotiation.
SDP can be negotiated more than once in an SIP INVITE or SIP RE-INVITE dialog.
Each occurrence of the List of SDP Media Components in the corresponding CDRs
may include either SDP offer or SDP answer. For the first negotiation, the SDP
answer defines which media are used in the session, therefore it shall be
recorded in case of successful session setup. Additionally the corresponding
SDP offer may be recorded. In case of unsuccessful session setup the SDP offer
may be recorded, if available.
When session re-negotiations occur, multiple occurrences of List of SDP Media
Components may be used to include a series of SDP negotiations in which each
occurrence holds an SDP offer or SDP answer as for the first SDP negotiation.
### 5.1.4 Trigger conditions
This clause contains the details for trigger conditions listed in table
5.2.1.1 for offline charging messages (Charging Data Request and Charging Data
Response) and table 5.3.1.1 for online charging messages (Debit / Reserve
Units Request and Debit / Reserve Response) triggered by SIP methods or ISUP
messages for all IMS nodes except for MRFC and AS.
The I-CSCF and BGCF, which need not be present in the signalling path for
subsequent requests after the first SIP INVITE, do not support session based
charging using Charging Data Request [Start, Interim, and Stop]. In these (and
only in these) IMS Network Elements, successful session set-up completion
triggers Charging Data Request [Event]. Use of session based charging when the
I-CSCF or the BGCF is call stateful is not described in this release.
The initial registration, user-initiated re-registration, and user-initiated
de-registration chargeable events relate to SIP REGISTER to trigger Charging
Data Request[Event] / Debit / Reserve Units Requests, while network-initiated
deregistration event relates to SIP NOTIFY to trigger Charging Data
Request[Event] / Debit / Reserve Units Requests provided that subscription to
registration events has been applied (see TS 24.229 [204]).
If at the time when the SIP 200 OK is received only the SDP offer is
available, the CTF may trigger Charging Data Request[Start] immediately
(subsequent SIP ACK containing the SDP answer triggers Charging Data
Request[Interim]) or may trigger Charging Data Request[Start] once the SIP ACK
has been received. The precise behaviour shall depend on operator policy.
If capturing the last user location information and/or UE Time Zone of one
specific party (originating or terminating) at session release is required by
operator (e.g. for legal purpose), and such information is not available at
the time the SIP BYE is received, the CTF shall delay the Charging Data
Request[Stop] until the reception of SIP 200 OK acknowledging the SIP BYE.
Otherwise, the CTF shall trigger Charging Data Request[Stop] once the SIP BYE
request has been received.
If capturing the last user location information and/or UE Time Zone of one
specific party (originating or terminating) at session release is required by
operator (e.g. for legal purpose), and such information is not available at
the time the SIP BYE is received, the CTF shall delay the Debit / Reserve
Units Request [Terminate] until the reception of SIP 200 OK acknowledging the
SIP BYE. Otherwise, the CTF shall trigger Debit / Reserve Units Request
[Terminate] once the SIP BYE request has been received. In any case, the
granted quota shall not be used once the SIP BYE is received.
### 5.1.5 IMS support of real-time tariff transfer
The TS 29.658 [206] describes the Real-time Transfer of Tariff Information
(RTTI) in SIP. The RTTI may be supported for the requested service (e.g.
tariff information of a value added service residing in the called network or
in a specific AS).
According to the procedures described in the TS 29.658 [206], tariff
information may be included in the content body of the following SIP messages:
1xx provisional response or SIP 200 OK at session setup, mid-dialog requests
or responses. The following IMS Network Elements, IBCF, MGCF, S-CSCF and AS
may pass tariff information and record the tariff information in the
corresponding CDRs for IMS offline charging. For online charging, the AS and
the IMS-GWF may send charging information related to the content body of RTTI
message over Ro interface to the OCS.
The following security mechanisms shall be used for RTTI:
\- IBCF shall accept RTTI information only from trusted IMS networks and
filter out RTTI information from non trusted IMS networks.
\- If RTTI information has to be sent over unsecure domain networks, the
security of the domains interconnection shall rely on Network Domain Security
specifications: TS 33.210 [208] and TS 33.310 [209].
\- The S-CSCF responsible for the handling of RTTI messages shall follow the
common IMS security specification TS 33.203 [207] to protect against malicious
UE that try to bypass the P-CSCF.
### 5.1.6 Served user identification
Subscriber Identifier is an Information Element used in both online and
offline charging information to identify the served user for the specific leg
of an IMS session. A list of Subscription Id(s) for IMS CDR shall contain the
Public user Id(s) for the served user.
In the case when the served user is obtained from the P-Header P-Served-User
(can be available in P-CSCF, S-CSCF and AS) then it shall also be used as
Subscription-Id in both online and offline charging.
The Subscriber Equipment Number field contains the identification of the
mobile device (e.g. IMEI) that the subscriber is using.
An Instance Id is defined as a URN generated by the device that uniquely
identifies a specific device amongst all other devices (fixed or mobile). The
Instance Id is transported in the sip.instance feature tag in the Contact
header of a SIP request associated with the served user.
### 5.1.7 Single charging session from AS/ATCF acting as B2BUA
When a session-initiating SIP INVITE message is received by an AS/ATCF, this
AS/ATCF, per application logic needs, acting as a B2BUA, may decide ICID for
the outgoing dialog to be the same as received or different.
In case the same ICID is preserved between incoming and outgoing dialog by the
AS/ATCF acting as a B2BUA, a single charging session for both dialogs can be
created by this AS/ATCF. This option, refered-to as \"OneChargingSession\" in
the different descriptions, is applicable per Operator configuration.
### 5.1.8 Charging support for roaming architecture for voice over IMS with
local breakout
The roaming architecture for voice over IMS with local breakout is described
in the TS 23.228 [201]. The corresponding Charging principles are defined in
the TS 32.240 [1]. In the present document, charging support for the Transit

### 5.1.9 Charging support for Network provided Location information
The Network provided Location information (NetLoc) is described in the TS
23.228 [201] and for emergency service request using PCC-based solutions for
the UE location in mobile networks in TS 23.167 [212].\ In some scenarios, an
AS can also detect emergency service and obtain the UE location using HSS-
based solutions in TS 23.167 [212].
Based on operator policies and the availability of the user location
information and/or UE Time Zone from the access network, the solution ensures
that relevant SIP messages contain the correct or up to date information about
the user location information, and/or UE Time Zone provided by the access
network and currently used by the UE.
For the 3GPP access networks, the Pâ€‘CSCF can retrieve user location
information and/or UE Time Zone related to the access network currently used
by the UE using PCC mechanisms, as specified in TS 23.203 [213] and TS 29.214
[214] In some scenarios, an AS can also obtain location information using HSS-
based solutions in TS 29.328 [215].
For fixed networks, the P-CSCF is aware of the network provided location
information through signalling with the NASS.
As specified in TS 24.229 [204], clause 7.2A.4.3, the network provided
location information is transported in the SIP P-Access-Network-Info header
with an \"np\" parameter and indicates details of where the UE is currently
located (i.e. SAI, TAI, RAI, CGI, ECGI or access-specific user location
information) as defined in TS 23.228 [214].
In the defined CDRs, the network provided location information available when
the CDR is opened, for 3GPP accesses is directly available in the User
Location Info field and also available in the Access Network Information or
Additional Access Network Information fields. For non-3GPP accesses, the
network provided location information available when the CDR is opened, shall
be available in either the Access Network Information or Additional Access
Network Information fields
NOTE 1: In a node that receives two PANI headers, in Rel-11, the operator
determined which PANI header (i.e., network-provided or UE-provided) would be
included in the Access Network Information field. For backward compatibility,
for an operator that deployed the Rel-11 capability the other PANI header
should be included in the Additional Access Network Information field.
NOTE 2: In a node that receives two PANI headers for an operator first
deploying this capability in Rel-12, it is recommended that the network-
provided PANI header be included in the Access Network Information field and a
UE-provided PANI header be included in the Additional Access Network
Information field.
In case terminating VoLTE UE attached to an MSC Server not enhanced for ICS,
AS is able to retrieve CS location information (i.e. VLR Number and MSC
Address) via Sh interface from HSS in TS 29.328 [215] which can be recorded in
AS CDR.
### 5.1.9A Charging support for IMS transit scenarios
The IMS transit network scenarios are described in the TS 23.228 [201] and may
require additional functionalities provided by the IMS Transit Functions (TF).
When residing in a stand-alone entity, the IMS TF may apply offline charging.
Applicable fields for the IMS TF are in table 6.3.2.1.
### 5.1.10 Charging support for TRF
In order to support traffic for the Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS
with Local Breakout, IMS TF are enhanced with additional routeing
functionality, both combined in a TRF and defined in TS 23.228 [201].
Depending on the transit operator configuration, these functions might reside
in a stand-alone entity or be collocated with an existing IMS Network Element.
When residing in a stand-alone entity, the TRF may apply offline charging.
When collocated with an existing IMS Network Element, charging information for
the TRF is combined with charging information of the corresponding IMS Network
Element. Applicable fields are in table 6.3.2.1.
### 5.1.11 Charging support for IMS service continuity
The charging requirements for IMS service continuity using AS and ATCF are
specified in TS 23.237 [216].
Inter-UE transfer provides the capability of transferring the communication
sessions with multiple media across different UEs and is part of Service
Continuity (SC) as described in TS 23.237 [216]. For inter-UE transfer shall
an AS implement the role of an SCC AS according to TS 24.337 [218].
A complete session can be transferred from one UE to another with or without
establishing a collaborative session as defined in TS 23.237 [216] and TS
24.337 [218]. The SCC AS is able to serve an inter-UE transfer request
initiated by the target UE without the establishment of a collaborative
session regardless of the access technology used by either of the involved
UEs.
For a consistent representation of the various access transfers specified in
TS 23.237 [216] and TS 24.337 [218] in offline and online charging of the AS
and in offline charging of the ATCF the Access Transfer Type parameter
provides information on the used access technologies, e.g. PS to CS, CS to PS,
PS to PS or CS to CS. The Inter-UE Transfer parameter indicates whether the
access transfer was done between two UEs provided by the SCC AS as defined in
TS 24.337 [218]. These parameters together, show the type of access transfer
in detail, and are reported together with UE identification (i.e. Subscriber
Equipment Number and/or Instance Id), Access Network Information and
potentially Additional Access Network Information and Cellular Network
Information available along the session transfer procedure.
Subsequently, the Requested Party Address parameter holds addresses related to
session transfer if available: For SIP transactions, the address of the party
(Public User ID or Public Service ID) to whom the SIP transaction was
originally posted. For PS to CS transfer, the Session Transfer Number for
Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (STN-SR) as described in TS 23.237 [216].
For CS to PS transfer, the Session Transfer Identifier for CS to PS Single
Radio Voice Call Continuity (STI-SR) as described in TS 23.237 [216].
### 5.1.12 IMS support of OCS-provided announcements
During an IMS online charging session, the OCS may utilize the Announcement
service specified in TS 32.281 [41] to request the IMS-GWF or AS to render
video or audio announcements to a subscriber involved in an IMS session.
### 5.1.13 Charging support of UE location(s) and TimeZone(s)
As specified in TS 24.229 [204], clause 7.2A.4.3, and in RFC 7315 [406],
details of the UE location and Timezone are transported in the SIP P-Access-
Network-Info header, which is conveyed in SIP signalling through IMS Nodes.
Consequently UE location and TimeZone changes are addressed under SIP
P-Access-Network-Info header changes.\ \ The SIP P-Access-Network-Info header
includes either UE-provided location, either Network-Provided location, both
are subject to change independently during an IMS session. Any available UE-
provided and Network-Provided locations are received by IMS Nodes in every SIP
requests and responses, and transported in two P-Access-Network-Info headers
when both are available.The charging support for Network-Provided location is
described in clause 5.1.9.
As specified in TS 24.229 [204], clause 7.2.15.3, when a User Agent (UA)
supporting one or more cellular radio access technology (e.g. E-UTRAN) is
using a non-cellular IP-CAN to access the IM CN subsystem, details of the
radio cell identity of the cellular radio access network on which the UE most
recently camped are transported in the SIP Cellular-Network-Info header, which
is conveyed in SIP signalling through IMS Nodes.
When Charging Data Request [Start/ Interim/Stop] are triggered for SIP
session-related procedures, based on principles described in clause 5.2.1, any
available SIP P-Access-Network-Info and SIP Cellular-Network-Info header(s)
shall be reported to the CDF, using Access Network Information, Additional
Access Network Information and Cellular Network Information IEs. The received
IEs shall be included by the CDF:
\- in Access Network Information, Additional Access Network Information and
Cellular Network Information fields of IMS CDRs, upon Charging Data Request
[Start] from IMS Nodes.
-_ in the List of Access Network Info Change field of IMS CDRs, upon reception of Charging Data Request [Interim, Stop] from IMS Nodes, only for SIP P-Access-Network-Info and SIP Cellular-Network-Info header(s) identified as changed.
When Debit / Reserve Units Request [Initial/ Update/Terminate] are triggered
for SIP session-related procedures, based on principles described in clause
5.3.1, any available SIP P-Access-Network-Info and SIP Cellular-Network-Info
header(s) shall be reported, using Access Network Information, Additional
Access Network Information and Cellular Network Information IEs.
As specified in clause 5.1.11, during IMS service continuity transfer
procedure, the Access Network Information, Additional Access Network
Information and Cellular Network Information shall be provided by the AS and
ATCF together with transfer parameters, using Access Transfer Information IE,
in offline and online charging.
## 5.2 IMS offline charging principles
### 5.2.1 Basic principles
The offline charging functionality is based on the IMS network nodes reporting
accounting information upon reception of various SIP methods or ISUP messages,
as most of the accounting relevant information is contained in these messages.
This reporting is achieved by sending Charging Data Request[start, interim,
stop and event] from the IMS Network Elements to the CDF.
The charging client uses Charging Data Request[start, interim and stop] in
procedures related to successful SIP sessions. It uses Charging Data
Request[event]s for unsuccessful SIP sessions and for session unrelated
procedures. Further details are specified in the tables below and in clause
5.2.2.
It is operator configurable in the nodes for which SIP method or ISUP messages
an Charging Data Request is sent. Table 5.2.1.1 describes all possible
Charging Data Requests that might be sent from a Pâ€‘CSCF, Iâ€‘CSCF, S-CSCF, IBCF,
MGCF or BGCF. A list of node specific Charging Data Requests, along with the
AVPs to be included are detailed in TS 32.299 [50].
The Charging Data Requests to be sent from a MRFC are described in table
5.2.1.2.
It is configurable for the operators to enable or disable the generation of an
Charging Data Request message by the IMS node in response to a particular
\"triggering SIP method /ISUP message\".

establishment. This is not shown in the diagram above.
##### 5.2.2.1.11 AS related procedures - AS acting as a redirect server
ASs may support a multitude of services which are not specified in 3GPP
standards. Therefore it is not possible to standardise charging flows and
procedures for those services. However, for all such services, the AS may
apply either event charging, where Charging Data Request [event] messages are
generated, or Session Charging, using Charging Data Request [start, stop and
interim]. The following clauses depict one example for each of the two
scenarios. The first procedure, AS acting as a redirect server, depicts the
\"event\" case, while the second procedure, AS acting as a voice mail server,
depicts the \"session\" case.
Figure 5.2.2.1.11.1 shows the case where an AS acts as a redirect server. In
the figure below, UE-1 sets up a session towards UE-2 but due to Call
Forwarding functionality located in the AS, a new number (to UE-3) is returned
to UE-1. Finally UE-1 sets up the session towards UE-3.
Figure 5.2.2.1.11.1: Message sequence chart for AS acting as a redirect server
1\. Sessions initiated by UE-1 towards UE-2.
2\. - 3. Response indicating that session should be redirected towards another

5\. The CDF acknowledges the reception of the data and creates the AS CDR.
6-7. Response indicating that session should be redirected towards another
number (UE-3).
8\. Session is initiated by UE-1 towards UE-3.
##### 5.2.2.1.12 AS related procedures - AS acting as a voice mail server
Figure 5.2.2.1.12.1 shows the case where an AS acts as a voice mail server.
S-CSCF invokes the AS acting as Voice Mail Server according to procedure as
defined in TS 23.218 [203].
Figure 5.2.2.1.12.1: Message sequence chart for AS acting as a mail server
1\. AS receives the SIP INVITE from the S-CSCF.
2\. AS acknowledges the initiated Voice Mail session by issuing a SIP 200 OK
in response to the SIP INVITE.
3\. AS sends Charging Data Request[Start] to record start of a voice mail
session.
4\. The CDF acknowledges the reception of the Charging Data Request[Start] and
opens an AS CDR.
5\. Voice mail session release is initiated.
6\. Upon reception of release message AS sends an Charging Data Request[Stop]
to record stop of a session in the AS CDR.
7\. The CDF acknowledges the reception of the data and closes the AS CDR.

1\. UEâ€‘1 wants to initiate a multimedia session with UEâ€‘2 with speech
components carried on CS bearers and non-speech components carried on PS
bearers. Therefore the multimedia session is split into two parts, each one
corresponding to a separate access leg. UEâ€‘1 initiates the establishment of
the first access leg by sending an SIP INVITE request with non-speech media
components. The SIP INVITE contains STI information indicating that a second
access leg (with the speech component) will be originated from the CS domain.
2\. The Sâ€‘CSCF executes any service logic as appropriate.
3\. The Sâ€‘CSCF sends the SIP INVITE to the SCC AS. The SCC AS identifies that
this access leg has to be correlated to a subsequent access leg based on the
STI information in the SIP INVITE.
4\. UEâ€‘1 request to set up call with CS bearer. The called party number is set
to an identifier such as a PSI DN, which is used to indicate to the SCC AS
that this access leg is to be combined with a PS leg.\ The DN is either
statically configured on the UE or assigned to the UE by the network upon IMS
Registration.

##### 5.2.2.1.19 Support of Optimal Media Routing (OMR)
###### 5.2.2.1.19.0 Introduction
Optimal Media Routing (OMR) relies on IMS-ALG function enhancement, used by
some IMS Nodes as described in TS 23.228 [201] Annex Q, when performing media
functions at transport level such as firewall or NAT, or application level
such as transcoding. The purpose of OMR is to identify and remove unnecessary
media functions from the media path for each media stream associated to a
session. The OMR procedures are applicable to the following IMS entities
having IMS-ALG function used in a B2BUA mode:
> \- P-CSCF for support of NAT for signalling and media (with IMS-ALG/IMS-AGW
> model as described in TS 23.228 [201]) Annex G);
>
> \- IBCF for border Control Functions towards other IMS/SIP Networks (with
> IBCF/TrGW model as described in TS 23.228 [201] Annex I);
>
> \- Any AS performing as a B2BUA controlling media resources.
Although the different TS 23.228 [201] scenarios mainly address the IBCF/TrGW,
they are also applicable to P-CSCF/ IMS-AGW, except for transcoding function
which relates to IBCF only. Consequently, in the different flows, the \"GW\"
stands for TrGW or IMS-AGW, according to the situation.
The following flows focus on one IMS Node behaviour, embedding such IMS-ALG
function supporting OMR, when involved in some of OMR scenarios described in
TS 23.228 [201] Annex Q.
Each media line of the same session can be applied with separate OMR decision
(i.e. different optimised paths), however, for simplification, only one media
is assumed in the following call flows.
In the Figure, the \"Originating side\" may be an Originating UA or another
IMS-ALG in the same IMS Network, or another IMS Network, and the \"Destination
side\" may be a Terminating UA or another IMS-ALG in the same IMS Network, or
another IMS Network.
###### 5.2.2.1.19.1 IMS-ALG related procedures for OMR -- Session
establishment and IMS-ALG bypasses its local GW
Figure 5.2.2.1.19.1.1 shows the session establishment with SDP offer/answer
exchange from Originating side towards a Destination side, traversing an IMS
Network Node including IMS-ALG function supporting OMR, and OMR results in
IMS-ALG bypasses its local GW.
Figure 5.2.2.1.19.1.-1: Message sequence chart for session establishment with
IMS-ALG supporting OMR and IMS-ALG bypasses its local GW due to OMR process.
1\. IMS-ALG receives an SIP INVITE with SDP offer-inc (call-ID#-inc) from
Originating side, containing the transport address allocated in realm R1 by
the Originating side for the media on incoming leg, and potential OMR
information from prior user plane segments.
2\. IMS-ALG determines the outgoing IP realm (R2) is different from the
incoming IP realm (R1) and interacts with a GW in order to allocate a local
transport address for the media on outgoing leg, in realm R2.
3\. IMS-ALG generates SIP INVITE towards Destination side (call-ID#-out), with
a new SDP offer-out including such local transport address, and also OMR
extensions (for the segment locally handled, along with those received from
prior user plane segments) for further OMR decisions.
4\. The destination side answers with SIP 200 OK and SDP answer-out, with the
transport address allocated by the destination side for the media on outgoing
leg, as result of OMR processing (based on OMR information provided in step
3). This transport address is in realm R1, thus identifying the local GW to be
bypassed (i.e. same IP realm as in step 1), and also identifying use of a
different IP realm from the default one (i.e. R2).
5\. The Local GW is de-allocated (release of resource allocated in step 2 in
realm R2).
6\. IMS-ALG forwards the SDP answer-inc for the media on incoming leg, with
this transport address received in step 4.
7\. IMS-ALG sends Charging Data Request[Start] to record start of session with
\"Local GW Not Inserted\" and \"IP realm Not Default\" indications for the
media.

Figure 5.2.2.1.19.2.1 shows the session establishment with SDP offer/answer
exchange from Originating side towards Destination side, traversing an IMS
Network Node including IMS-ALG function supporting OMR, and OMR results in
alternate IP realm selection (i.e. not the default IP realm) for the media.

Originating side, containing the transport address allocated in realm R1 by
the Originating side for the media on incoming leg, and potential OMR
information from prior user plane segments.
2\. IMS-ALG determines the outgoing IP realm (R2) is different from the
incoming IP realm (R1) and interacts with a GW1 in order to allocate a local
transport address for the media on outgoing leg, in realm R2. IMS-ALG
additionally interacts with GW2 in order to allocate an alternate local
transport address for the media in realm R3.
3\. IMS-ALG generates SIP INVITE towards Destination side (call-ID#-out), with
a new SDP offer-out including such local transport addresses, and also OMR
extensions (for the segment locally handled, along with those received from
prior user plane segments) for further OMR decisions.
4\. The destination side answers with SIP 200 OK and SDP answer-out, with the
transport address allocated by the destination side for the media on outgoing
leg, as result of OMR processing (based on OMR information provided in step
3).This transport address is in realm R3, thus identifying the local GW2 to be
retained, and also identifying use of a different IP realm from the default
one (i.e. R2).
5\. The GW1 is de-allocated (release of resource allocated in step 2 for realm
R2), and interaction occurs with GW2 to maintain the user plane connection via
R3.
6\. IMS-ALG1 forwards the SDP answer-inc, with the transport address allocated
by the GW2 in realm R1, for the media on incoming leg.
7\. IMS-ALG sends Charging Data Request[Start] to record start of session with
\"Local GW Inserted\" and \"IP realm Not Default\" indications for the media.
8-9. The CDF opens a session CDR for the IMS Node and acknowledges the
reception of the data.
10a-b. A user plane connection is now established in realm R1 up to the GW2,
and in realm R3 from the GW2 for the media.
###### 5.2.2.1.19.3 IMS-ALG related procedures for OMR -- mid-session
procedure
Figure 5.2.2.1.19.3.1 shows a scenario when a new SDP offer/answer exchange
due to UE generating a SIP (rEâ€‘)iNVITE or SIP UPDATE in mid-session in order
to add a media component , and the OMR procedures is processed for this new
media, with same situation as in clause 5.2.2.1.19.1 (IMS-ALG bypasses its
local GW).
This scenario also applies for situations where a (rEâ€‘)iNVITE or a SIP UPDATE
is issued for updating a media and the OMR procedures is processed again,
changing the established media path.

###### 5.2.2.1.19.4 IMS-ALG related procedures for OMR -- transcoding
###### # 5.2.2.1.19.4.0 Introduction
As described in TS 23.228 [201] Annex Q, transcoding is also part of OMR
process.
The following flows 5.2.2.1.19.4.1 show session establishment with SDP
offer/answer exchange from Originating side towards a Destination side,
traversing an IMS Network Node including IMS-ALG function supporting OMR with
transcoder inserted by this IMS node.
Although transcoding aspect is part of the same SDP offer/answer different
exchanges described in clause 5.2.2.1.19.1 to clause 5.2.2.1.19.3, therefore
combined in OMR process, it is reflected here through dedicated flows for
simplification.
These procedures apply to IBCF/TrGW only.

Originating side, containing a codec-list-inc in the SDP offer, and potential
OMR information from prior user plane segments based on an Operator\'s
configuration.
2\. IMS-ALG interacts with TrGW for transcoder allocation for the purpose of
offering an additional codec \"codec-out\".
3\. IMS-ALG generates INVITE towards Destination side (call-ID#-out), the SDP
offer-out containing the new codec-list-out (i.e. codec-list-inc enriched with
\"codec-out\"), and also OMR extensions (for transcoding options associated to

selected codec which is the additional one offered by IMS-ALG (i.e. codec-
out).

6\. IMS-ALG forwards the SDP answer-inc for the incoming leg, with this codec-
inc.
7\. IMS-ALG sends Charging Data Request[Start] to record start of session with

###### # 5.2.2.1.19.4.2 IMS-ALG related procedures for OMR -- transcoder
offered by IMS-ALG but not selected
The fflow in figure 5.2.2.1.19.4.2.1 describes the situation where IMS-ALG
allocates a transcoder for offering an additional transcoding option, and this
transcoder is not selected.
Figure 5.2.2.1.19.4.2.1: Message sequence chart for session establishment with
transcoder offered by IMS-ALG is not selected
1\. IMS-ALG receives an SIP INVITE with SDP offer-inc (call-ID#-inc) from
Originating side, containing a codec-list-inc in the SDP offer, and potential
OMR information from prior user plane segments, based on an Operator\'s
configuration.
2\. IMS-ALG interacts with TrGW for transcoder allocation for the purpose of
offering additional codec \"codec-out\".
3\. IMS-ALG generates SIP INVITE towards Destination side (call-ID#-out), the
SDP offer-out containing the new codec-list-out (i.e. codec-list-inc enriched
with \"codec-out\"), and also OMR extensions (for transcoding options
associated to different segments).
4\. The destination side answers with SIP 200 OK and SDP answer-out with the
selected codec (codec-inc), belonging to the codec-list-inc received in step 1
(original offer).
5\. Therefore, transcoding is not needed, and TrGW is de-allocated.
6\. IMS-ALG forwards the SDP answer-inc for the incoming leg, with this codec-
inc.
7\. IMS-ALG sends Charging Data Request[Start] to record start of session with
\"Transcoder Not Inserted\" indication for the media.

#### 5.2.2.2 Message flows - error cases and scenarios
##### 5.2.2.2.0 Introduction
This clause describes various error cases and how these should be handled. The
error cases are grouped into the following categories:
â€¢ Failure in SIP related procedures:
\- Session related error scenarios;
\- Session unrelated error scenarios.
â€¢ Errors in Charging Data Transfer related procedures.
##### 5.2.2.2.1 Session related SIP procedures- reception of SIP error
messages
A SIP session is closed abnormally by the reception of a SIP BYE message
indicating the reason for such termination.
In this case, an Charging Data Request[stop] message that includes an
appropriate error indication is sent.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Session related SIP procedures - SIP session failure
All nodes involved in the SIP session are expected to exercise some kind of
session supervision. In case a node detects an error in the SIP session, such
as a timeout or the occurrence of an invalid SIP message that results in the
inability to maintain the session, this IMS node will generate a SIP BYE
message towards both ends of the connection.
The node that sent the BYE to trigger session termination identifies the cause
of the failure in the Charging Data Request [stop] towards the CDF. All other
nodes, i.e. those that receive the SIP BYE, are not aware of an error, and
therefore they treat this situation as any normal SIP session termination.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 Session unrelated SIP procedures
As described in clause 5.1.2.1.2, a session unrelated SIP procedure may either
be completed with the reception of a SIP 200 OK, or a SIP error message. If
the latter occurs, i.e. there is a failure in the procedure, the Charging Data
Request[event] sent towards the CDF includes an appropriate error indication.
##### 5.2.2.2.4 CDF connection failure
When the connection towards the primary CDF is broken, the process of sending
accounting information should continue towards a secondary CDF (if such a CDF
is configured). For further CDF connection failure functionality, see clause
\"_Transport Failure Detection_ \" in IETF RFC 3588 [401].
If no CDF is reachable the Network Element may buffer the generated accounting
data in non-volatile memory. Once the CDF connection is working again, all
Charging Data messages stored in the buffer is sent to the CDF, in the order
they were stored in the buffer.
##### 5.2.2.2.5 No reply from CDF
In case an IMS node does not receive an Charging Data Response in reply to an
Charging Data Request, it may repeat the Charging Data Request message. The
waiting time until a repetition is sent, and the maximum number of repetitions
are both configurable by the operator. When the maximum number of repetitions
is reached and still no Charging Data Response reply has been received, the
IMS node executes the CDF connection failure procedure as specified above.
If retransmitted Charging Data Requests are sent, they are marked with the
T-flag as described in IETF RFC 3588 [401] , in order to allow duplicate
detection in the CDF, as specified in the next clause.
##### 5.2.2.2.6 Duplicate detection
A charging client marks possible duplicate request messages (e.g.
retransmission due to the link failover process) with the T-flag as described
in IETF RFC 3588 [401].
If the CDF receives a message that is marked as retransmitted and this message
was already received, then it discards the duplicate message. However, if the
original of the re-transmitted message was not yet received, it is the
information in the marked message that is taken into account when generating
the CDR. The CDRs are marked if information from duplicated message(s) is
used.
##### 5.2.2.2.7 CDF detected failure
The CDF closes a CDR when it detects that expected Charging Data Requests for
a particular SIP session have not been received for a period of time. The
exact behaviour of the CDF is operator configurable.
### 5.2.3 CDR generation
Editor\'s Note: FFS
### 5.2.4 GTP\' record transfer flows
GTP\' is not used between CDF and CGF for IMS offline charging because CDF and
CGF are combined into CCF (see clause 4.2).
NOTE: Vendors may nevertheless implement a separate CDF and CGF for IMS
offline charging. In this case, it is recommended that the approach chosen
conforms to the principles and protocol applications specified in TS 32.295
[54].
### 5.2.5 Bi CDR file transfer
The CGF will receive charging events from each AS involved in a SIP dialog.
This may result in multiple CDRs, some of these CDRs may be redundant for
billing purposes. When preparing these CDRs for the BD, the CGF may elect not
to send some CDRs or may perform consolidation before transfer based on the
operator\'s configuration.
## 5.3 IMS online charging scenarios
### 5.3.1 Basic principles
IMS online charging uses the Credit-Control application that is specified in
TS 32.299 [50].
Three cases for online charging are distinguished:
â€¢ Immediate Event Charging (IEC); and
â€¢ event charging with unit reservation (ECUR), and
  * Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR).
Both stage 2 and stage 3 mechanisms for the three cases for online charging
are detailed in TS 32.299 [50].
In the case of Immediate Event Charging (IEC), granting units to the IMS
Network Element is performed in a single operation that also includes the
deduction of the corresponding monetary units from the subscriber\'s account.
The charging process is controlled by the corresponding Debit UnitsRequest
which is sent for a given Credit-Control event.
In contrast, Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) also includes the
process of requesting, reserving, releasing and returning unused units for
events. The deduction of the corresponding monetary units then occurs upon
conclusion of the ECUR transaction. In this case, the Debit / Reserve Units
Request is used to control the Credit-Control session.
Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR) is used for Credit-Control of
sessions. SCUR also includes the process of requesting, reserving, releasing
and returning unused units for sessions, and the deduction of the
corresponding monetary units. During a SIP session there can be repeated
execution of unit reservation and debit operations as specified in TS 32.299
[50].
The IMS Network Element may apply IEC, where Debit UnitsRequest[event]
messages are generated, or ECUR, using Reserve Units Request[Initial] and
Debit Units Request[Terminate] or SCUR. The decision whether to apply IEC,
ECUR or SCUR is based on the service and/or operator\'s policy.
The CTF uses Debit / Reserve Units Request[Initial, Update, Terminate] in
procedures related to successful SIP sessions. It uses Debit Units
Request[event] or Reserve Units Request[Event or Initial, Terminate] depending
on whether IEC or ECUR/SCUR applies) for unsuccessful SIP sessions and for
session unrelated procedures. Further details are specified in the tables
below.
It is operator configurable in the nodes for which SIP method a Debit /
Reserve Units Request is sent. The table below describes all possible Debit /
Reserve Units Requests that might be sent from an IMS GWF or an MRFC or an AS.
It is configurable for the operators to enable or disable the generation of a
Debit / Reserve Units Request message by the IMS node in response to a
particular \"triggering SIP method\".

### 5.3.2 Message flows and types
#### 5.3.2.0 Introduction
This clause describes the message flows for the event charging procedures on
the Ro interface. The IMS functions providing online charging _via_ the Ro
interface are the S-CSCF with IMS GWF, the AS and the MRFC.
NOTE: The following sub-clauses only show the scenarios of the S-CSCF with
IMS-GWF case and the AS case. The scenarios of the MRFC are FFS.
#### 5.3.2.1 Immediate Event Charging (IEC)
##### 5.3.2.1.0 Introduction
This clause provides the details of the \"Debit Units\" operation specified in
TS 32.299 [50].
##### 5.3.2.1.1 Message flows - successful cases and scenarios
###### 5.3.2.1.1.1 IEC -- Debit Units operation
The transactions that are required on the Ro interface in order to perform IEC
with Debit Units operations are carried out as described in TS 32.299 [50]
where CTF refers to IMS Network Element. The Debit Units operation may
alternatively be carried out prior to, concurrently with or after
service/content delivery. the IMS Network Element must ensure that the
requested service execution is successful, when this scenario is used.
Editor\'s Note: Must be aligned with TS 32.299 [50].
###### 5.3.2.1.1.2 Scenarios
Figure 5.3.2.1.1.2.1 shows the Debit Units transactions that are required
between the IMS-GWF/AS and the OCS for session-unrelated IMS procedures, i.e.
those that relate to the Debit Units Request[event], as listed in table
5.3.1.1.
SIP messages and Charging Data transactions associated with these charging
scenarios are shown primarily for general information and to illustrate the
charging triggers. They are not intended to be exhaustive and depend on the
Debit Units Request triggers configured by the operator.
##### **Scenario 1: Successful session unrelated case**
{#scenario-1-successful-session-unrelated-case .H6}
NOTE: The Debit Units operation is carried out prior to service/content
delivery.
Figure 5.3.2.1.1.2.1: Message sequence chart for session-unrelated procedure
1) A session unrelated SIP request (e.g. SUBSCRIBE) is received in the S-CSCF.
The S-CSCF forwards this request to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) The IMS-GWF/AS sends a Debit Units Request[Event] to the OCS, requesting
units in order to provide the service.
3) The OCS sends the Debit Units Response to acknowledge the Debit Units
Request, granting the requested units.
4) The IMS-GWF/AS and the S-CSCF forward the SIP request.
##### 5.3.2.1.2 Message flows - error cases and scenarios
###### 5.3.2.1.2.0 Introduction
This clause describes various error cases and how these should be handled.
The failure handling behaviour is locally configurable in the IMS Network
Element. If the _Direct-Debiting-Failure-Handling_ AVP is not used, the
locally configured values are used instead.
###### 5.3.2.1.2.1 Reception of SIP error messages
If SIP errors in SIP response (4xx, 5xx or 6xx) occur during service delivery,
as defined in TS 24.228 [202] and TS 23.218 [203], it is up to the IMS Network
Element to determine to what extent the service was delivered before the error
occurred and act appropriately with respect to charging. This may imply that
no units at all (or no more units) are debited.
###### 5.3.2.1.2.2 Debit Units operation failure
This case comprises situations where either no, or an erroneous response, is
received from the OCS. The \"no response\" case is detected by the IMS Network
Element when the connection supervision timer Tx expires (IETF RFC 4006 [402])
before a Debit / Reserve Units Response is received. The case of receiving an
erroneous response implies that the IMS Network Element receives a Debit /
Reserve Units Response, which it is unable to process, while Tx is running.
The failure handling complies with the failure procedures for \"Direct
Debiting\" scenario described in IETF RFC 4006 [402].
###### 5.3.2.1.2.3 Duplicate detection
The detection of duplicate request is needed and must be enabled. To speed up
and simplify as much as possible the duplicate detection, the all-against-all
record checking should be avoided and just those records marked as potential
duplicates need to be checked against other received requests (within a
reasonable time window) by the receiver entity.
The IMS Network Element marks the request messages that are retransmitted
after a link failover as possible duplicates with the T-flag as described in
TS 23.228 [201]. For optimized performance, uniqueness checking against other
received requests is only necessary for those records marked with the T-flag
received within a reasonable time window. This focused check is based on the
inspection of the _Session-Id_ and _CC-Request-Number_ AVP pairs.
#### 5.3.2.2 Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) and Session Charging
with Unit Reservation (SCUR)
##### 5.3.2.2.0 General
This clause provides the details of the \"Reserve Units\" and \"Debit Units\"
operation specified in TS 32.299 [50].
##### 5.3.2.2.1 Message flows - successful cases and scenarios
###### 5.3.2.2.1.1 ECUR and SCUR - Reserve / Debit Units operations
The transactions that are required on the Ro interface in order to perform
ECUR/SCUR with Reserve / Debit Units operations is carried out as described in
TS 32.299 [50] where CTF refers to an IMS Network Element. Multiple
replications of both of these operations are possible.
###### 5.3.2.2.1.2 Expiration of reservation validity
This clause defines how reserved units are returned, if not used, within a
reasonable time. It should be possible that both, reservation and SIP sessions
are cancelled or only the reservation is cancelled without removing the SIP
session.
###### 5.3.2.2.1.3 Scenarios
###### # 5.3.2.2.1.3.0 Introduction
The following figures show the Reserve Units transactions that are required
between the IMS-GWF/AS and the OCS for session-related and session-unrelated
IMS procedures.
The SIP messages and Charging Data transactions associated with these charging
scenarios are shown primarily for general information and to illustrate the
charging triggers. They are not intended to be exhaustive and they depend on
the Reserve Units Request triggers configured by the operator.
All of the scenarios depict originating sessions only.
###### # 5.3.2.2.1.3.1 Session related procedures (SCUR)
**Scenario 1: Successful session establishment**
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.1 shows the Reserve Units transactions that are required
in the IMS-GWF/AS during a SIP session establishment.
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.1: Message sequence chart for successful session
establishment
1) An initial SIP Invite Request is received in the S-CSCF. This request is
forwarded to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) The IMS-GWF/AS sends a Reserve Units Request[Initial] to the OCS requesting
service units. The online Credit-Control session is initiated.
3) The OCS grants units in the Reserve Units Response.
4) The IMS-GWF/AS and S-CSCF forward the initial SIP INVITE.
5) A final response is received in the IMS-GWF/AS.
6) If the trigger is active, the SIP 200 OK answer triggers a Reserve Units
Request[Update] in the IMS-GWF/AS in order to update the Credit-Control
session. New service units are requested. Also the used service units (if any)
are reported.
7) The OCS sends the Reserve Units Response to acknowledge the Reserve Units
Request. New service units are granted.
8) The final answer is forwarded.
**Scenario 2: Successful session establishment with early media negotiation**
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.2 shows the Charging Data transactions that are required
in the IMS-GWF/AS during a SIP session establishment in which SDP negotiation
is completed before a final response to the initial SIP INVITE is exchanged.
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.2: Message sequence chart for session establishment with
early media negotiation
1) An initial SDP offer is conveyed in a SIP INVITE message. The SIP INVITE
message received in the S-CSCF is forwarded to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) In this example, the SDP offer is conveyed in a SIP request which implies
the start of the online Credit-Control session towards the OCS. The IMS-GWF/AS
sends a Reserve Units Request[Initial] to the OCS requesting service units.
The online Credit-Control session is initiated.
3) The OCS grants units in the Reserve Units Response.
4) The IMS-GWF/AS and S-CSCF forward the SIP request conveying the SDP offer.
5) A non-final SIP message (e.g. a provisional reliable response) conveying an
SDP answer is received in the IMS-GWF/AS.
6) The received SDP answer triggers a Reserve Units Request[Update] in order
to update the session. New service units are requested. Also the used service
units (if any) are reported.
7) The OCS sends the Reserve Units Response to acknowledge the Reserve Units
Request. New service units are granted.
8) The SDP answer is forwarded.
**Scenario 3: Mid-session procedures**
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.3 shows the Charging Data transactions that are required
in the IMS-GWF/AS when receiving a SIP RE-iNVITE in mid-session, e.g. in order
to modify media component(s), or when the hold and resume procedure is
executed.
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.3: Message sequence chart for mid-session procedures
1) A SIP RE-INVITE request is received in the S-CSCF. This request is
forwarded to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) Upon receiving the SIP RE-INVITE request, the IMS-GWF/AS sends a Reserve
Units Request[Update] to update the previously initiated session. New service
units are requested. The used service units (if any) are also reported.
3) The OCS grants new service units in the Reserve Units Response.
4) The RE-INVITE request is forwarded.
5) The RE-INVITE request is acknowledged with a SIP 200 OK.

requested. The used service units (if any) are also reported.
7) The OCS grants new service units in the Reserve Units Response.
8) The SIP 200 OK message is forwarded.
**Scenario 4: Session release**
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.4 shows the Debit / Reserve Units operation that are
required in the IMS-GWF/AS for a session release scenario with SIP BYE
triggering online Credit-Control session termination.
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.4: Message sequence chart for session release (SIP BYE
triggering Credit-Control session termination).
1) A SIP session is released by sending a SIP BYE message. The S-CSCF forwards
this message to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) Upon receiving the SIP BYE message, the IMS-GWF/AS forwards the SIP BYE
request to the UE.
3) In case there is an ongoing online control session, the IMS-GWF/AS sends a
Reserve Units Request[Terminate] reporting the used granted units.
4) The OCS sends a Reserve Units Response. The online Credit-Control session
is terminated.
5) The final answer to the SIP BYE message is forwarded.
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.4A shows the Debit / Reserve Units operation that are
required in the IMS-GWF/AS for a session release scenario with SIP 200 OK
triggering online Credit-Control session termination.
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.4A: Message sequence chart for session release (SIP 200
OK triggering Credit-Control session termination).
1) A SIP session is released by receiving a SIP BYE message. The S-CSCF
forwards this message to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) Upon receiving the SIP BYE message, the IMS-GWF/AS forwards the SIP BYE
request to the UE. In case there is an ongoing online control session, and the
IMS-GWF/AS is configured to wait for SIP 200 OK acknowledging SIP BYE, the
counter of used granted units is stopped.
3) The release is acknowledged by SIP 200 OK forwarded to the IMS-GWF/AS by
the S-CSCF.

Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.5 shows the Debit / Reserve Units operationthat are
required in the IMS-GWF/AS during a SIP session establishment when RTTI
message is received embedded in the SIP 200 OK.
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1.5: Message sequence chart for successful session
establishment with reception of RTTI message
1) An initial SIP INVITE request is received in the S-CSCF. This request is
forwarded to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) The IMS-GWF/AS sends a Reserve Units Request[Initial] to the OCS requesting
service units. The online Credit-Control session is initiated.
3) The OCS grants units in the Reserve Units Response.
4) The IMS-GWF/AS and S-CSCF forward the initial SIP INVITE.
5) A final response is received in the IMS-GWF/AS, which embeds a RTTI XML
body.
6) If the trigger is active, the SIP 200 OK answer triggers a Reserve Units
Request[Update] in the IMS-GWF/AS in order to update the session and take into
account the RTTI XML body within the SIP 200 OK (see NOTE). New service units
are requested. Also the used service units (if any) are reported.
7) The OCS sends the Reserve Units Response to acknowledge the Reserve Units
Request. New service units are granted.
8) The final answer is forwarded.
NOTE: The mapping of RTTI XML body on Tariff Information structure is
described in TS 32.280 [36].
###### # 5.3.2.2.1.3.2 Session unrelated procedures (ECUR)
**Scenario 1: Successful session unrelated procedure**
Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.2.1shows the Debit / Reserve Units operation that are

7) The IMS-GWF/AS sends a Debit Units Request[Terminate] to the OCS. It also
reports the used granted units.
8) The OCS sends a Debit Units Response to acknowledge the Debit Units
Request. The online session is terminated.
9) The IMS-GWF/AS and S-CSCF forward the SIP response.
##### 5.3.2.2.2 Message flows - error cases and scenarios
###### 5.3.2.2.2.0 Introduction
This clause describes various error cases and how these should be handled.
The failure handling behaviour is locally configurable in the IMS Network
Element. If _Credit-Control-Failure-Handling_ AVP is not used, the locally
configured values are used instead.
###### 5.3.2.2.2.1 Reception of SIP error messages
If SIP errors occur during service delivery, as defined in [202] and [203], it
is up to the IMS Network Element to determine to what extent the service was
delivered before the error occurred and act appropriately with respect to
charging. This may imply that no units at all (or no more units) are reserved
or debited.
###### 5.3.2.2.2.2 Debit / Reserve Units operation failure
This case comprises of OCS connection failure, and/or receiving error
responses from the OCS.
The IMS Network Element detects an OCS connection failure when the timer Tx
expires (IETF RFC 4006 [402]) or a transport failure is detected as defined in
IETF RFC 3588 [401]. The OCS also has the capability to detect failures when
the timer Ts (IETF RFC 3588 [401]) expires. The OCS should indicate the cause
of failure by setting the appropriate result code as defined in IETF RFC 3588
[401] and IETF RFC 4006 [402]. In any case, the failure handling of IMS
Network Element and OCS complies with the failure procedures for session based
Credit-Control scenario described in IETF RFC 4006 [402].
###### 5.3.2.2.2.3 Duplicate detection
For Debit / Reserve Units operation duplicate detection is performed only for
possible duplicate event requests related to IEC as mentioned in clause
5.3.2.1.2.3, as retransmission of ECUR/SCUR related Debit / Reserve Units
Requests is not allowed.
###### 5.3.2.2.2.4 Aborted session setup
If a trigger occurs during session establishment to release a session during
the establishment procedure, the IMS Network Element shall initiate procedures
to cancel the session establishment as defined in TS 24.229 [204].\ On
completion of the cancellation procedure, the IMS Network Element shall close
the credit-control session (for SCUR and ECUR) indicating an appropriate cause
code.
#### 5.3.2.3 IMS service termination by OCS
##### 5.3.2.3.0 Introduction
Annex B describes several scenarios related to IMS service termination.
NOTE: The annex B only shows the scenario of the S-CSCF with IMS-GWF case.
For IMS session related scenarios charged by means of SCUR in the IMS-GWF,
service termination shall imply the rejection of a request for IMS session
establishment or the release of an established session that is possibly
associated to an online charging session.
For IMS session unrelated scenarios charged by means of ECUR in the IMS-GWF,
Service Termination shall imply the rejection of the SIP method triggering the
Reserve Units Request as defined in TS 32.299 [50].
For IMS session unrelated scenarios charged by means of IEC prior to
service/content delivery in the IMS-GWF, service termination shall imply the
rejection of the SIP method triggering the Debit Units Request as defined in
TS 32.299 [50].
##### 5.3.2.3.1 Triggers on Ro interface which imply the termination of the
IMS service
The procedures in Ro interface which may trigger the IMS Service termination
are the following:
\- Reception of an unsuccessful Operation Result different from
DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE (TS 32.299 [50]) in the Debit / Reserve
Units Response message.
\- Reception of an unsuccessful Result Code different from
DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE (TS 32.299 [50]) within the multiple
units operation in the Debit / Reserve Units Response message when only one
instance of the multiple units operation field is used.
\- Execution of the termination action procedure as defined in TS 32.299 [50]
when only one instance of the Multiple Unit Operation field is used.
\- Execution of the failure handling procedures when the Failure Action is set
to 'Terminate\' or 'Retry & Terminate\'.
> Reception in the IMS-GWF of an Abort-Session-Request message from OCS.
In case either a Final-Unit-Indication or an erroneous Result-Code at multiple
units operation level trigger the IMS service termination and the charging is
based on ECUR or SCUR, the IMS-GWF shall close the online session by sending a
Debit Units and Reserve Units operation of Type 'Terminate\'.
Refer to TS 32.299 [50] for a detailed description of these procedures.
##### 5.3.2.3.2 Indication to the UE of the reason for IMS service release
As a result of service termination triggering in IMS-GWF, the IMS service
shall be denied to end-users. The network should provide an indication to UEs
of the reason the service has been released or rejected. The procedure shall
depend on:
\- The charged party.
The network should provide UEs with an indication of the reason the service
has been released or rejected. However, this reason shall depend on whether
the UE is the charged party or not. The premise is that only the charged party
should know that the IMS service is being rejected / released because of OCS
interaction.
\- IMS specific protocol issues as defined in TS 24.229 [204].
A) In this scenario, the Response Code of the SIP response shall indicate the
server understood the request but is refusing to fulfil it and that this
request should not be repeated. The SIP response may include additional
information about the cause to reject/release the IMS service. The presence of
this additional error information in the response shall be operator
configurable.
> The additional information included in the SIP response may contain a SIP
> URI. The UE may treat the SIP URI as if it were a Contact in a redirect and
> generate a new SIP INVITE, resulting, for example, in a recorded
> announcement session being established. If announcement information is
> present in the Debit / Reserve Units Response message then a SIP URI should
> not be provided in the SIP response for redirection purposes.
B) The IMS-GWF generates a SIP request (e.g. SIP BYE or SIP CANCEL) as a
result of the IMS Service Termination procedure:
> In this scenario, the IMS-GWF may include a 'Reason\' field in the request
> which provides additional information about the cause to reject/release the
> IMS service. The presence of this additional information in the request
> shall be operator configurable.
>
> In both scenarios, it shall also be operator configurable both per SIP
> method and per Originating/Terminating side, the content of the additional
> error information sent to the UEs. This error information shall also be
> configurable based on the procedure in Ro interface which has triggered the
> release/rejection of the IMS service according to clause 5.3.2.3.1. In
> particular when the service termination is triggered by the reception of an
> unsuccessful operation result (different from
> DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE as defined in TS 32.299 [50]) in the
> Debit / Reserve Units Response message or the reception of an unsuccessful
> Result Code (different from DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE as
> defined in TS 32.299 [50]) within the multiple units operation in the Debit
> / Reserve Units Response message, the additional error information/reason
> shall also be configurable based on the Result Code received through Ro
> interface.

## 6.1 Data description for IMS offline charging
### 6.1.1 Rf message contents
#### 6.1.1.0 Introduction
The IMS nodes generate accounting information that can be transferred from the
CTF to the CDF. For this purpose, IMS offline charging utilises the _Charging
Data Transfer_ that is specified in the 3GPP accounting application described
in TS 32.299 [50].
The Charging Data Transfer operation employs the Charging Data Request and
Charging Data Response messages. Table 6.1.1.0.1 describes the use of these
messages for offline charging.

### 6.1.3 CDR description on the Bi interface
#### 6.1.3.1 CDR content description
The following standard CDR content and format are considered:
\- S-CSCF-CDR generated based on information from the S-CSCF
\- I-CSCF-CDR generated based on information from the I-CSCF
\- P-CSCF-CDR generated based on information from the P-CSCF
\- BGCF-CDR generated based on information from the BGCF

\- TF-CDR generated based on information from the IMS TF
\- TRF-CDR generated based on information from the TRF
\- ATCF-CDR generated based on information from the ATCF
The content of each CDR type is defined in the tables in clauses 6.1.3.3 to
6.14.3.1. For each CDR type the field definition includes the CDR parameter
(\"field name\"), category and description. The categories in the tables are
used according to the charging data configuration defined in clause 5.4 of TS
32.240 [1].
Editor\'s Note: Equipment vendors shall be able to provide all of the fields
listed in the CDR content table in order to claim compliance with the present
document. However, since CDR processing and transport consume network
resources, operators may opt to eliminate some of the fields that are not
essential for their operation.
The CDF provides the CDRs at the Bi interface in the format and encoding
described in TS 32.298 [51]. Additional CDR formats and contents may be
available at the interface to the billing system to meet the requirements of
the billing system, these are outside of the scope of 3GPP standardisation.
#### 6.1.3.2 CDR triggers
##### 6.1.3.2.1 Session related CDRs
Reflecting the usage of multimedia sessions IMS CDRs are generated by the CDF
on a per session level. In the scope of the present document the term
\"session\" refers always to a SIP session. The coherent media components are
reflected inside the session CDRs with a media component container comprising
of all the information necessary for the description of a media component.
Accounting information for SIP sessions is transferred from the CTF involved
in the session to the CDF using Charging Data Request[start, interim and stop]
messages. A session CDR is opened in the CDF upon reception of a Charging Data
Request[start] message. Partial CDRs may be generated upon reception of a
Charging Data Request[interim] message, which is sent by the network entity
towards the CDF due to a session modification procedure (i.e. change in
media). Session CDRs are updated, or partial CDRs are generated upon reception
of a Charging Data Request[Interim] message, which is sent by the network
entity due to expiration of the Charging Data Interim Interval. The CDF closes
the final session CDR upon reception of a Charging Data Request[stop] message,
which indicates that the SIP session is terminated. Further details on
triggers for the generation of IMS CDRs are specified in [1].
Accounting information for unsuccessful session set-up attempts may be sent by
the CTF to the CDF employing the Charging Data Request[event] message. The
behaviour of the CDF upon receiving Charging Data Request [event] messages is
specified in clause 6.1.3.2.2.
##### 6.1.3.2.2 Session unrelated CDRs
To reflect chargeable events not directly related to a session the CDF may
generate CDRs upon the occurrence of session unrelated SIP procedures, such as
registration respectively de-registration events. Accounting information for
SIP session-unrelated procedures is transferred from the IMS nodes involved in
the procedure to the CDF using Charging Data Request[event] messages. Session
unrelated CDRs are created in the CDF in a \"one-off\" action based on the
information contained in the Charging Data Request[event] message. One session
unrelated CDR is created in the CDF for each Charging Data Request[event]
message received, whereas the creation of partial CDRs is not applicable for
session unrelated CDRs. The cases for which the IMS nodes send Charging Data
Request[event] messages are listed per SIP procedure in table 5.2.1.1 and
table 5.2.1.2.
Further details on triggers for the generation of IMS CDRs are specified in
clause 5.2.2.

## 6.2 Data description for IMS online charging
### 6.2.1 Ro message contents
#### 6.2.1.0 Introduction
The IMS nodes generate Debit / Reserve Units message information that can be
transferred from the CTF to the OCF. For this purpose, IMS online charging
utilises the _Debit Units / Reserve Units_ procedure that is specified in the
3GPP Debit / Reserve Units operation in TS 32.299 [50].
The _Debit / Reserve Units_ procedure employs the _Debit / Reserve Units
Request_ and _Debit / Reserve Units Response_ messages. Table 6.2.1.0
describes the use of these messages in IMS online charging.

### 6.3.2 Detailed message format for offline charging
The following clause specifies per Operation Type the charging data that are
sent by each of the IMS Network Elements for:
> \- IMS session and IMS event (S/I/S/E)
>
> S-CSCF, E-CSCF, P-CSCF, MGFC, AS, IBCF, TRF, ATCF, TF
>
> \- IMS session only (S/I/S)
>
> MRFC
>
> \- IMS event only (E)
>
> I-CSCF, BGCF
The Operation Types are listed in the following order: S (Start)/I (Interim)/S
(Stop)/E (Event). Therefore, when all Operation Types are possible it is
marked as SISE. If only some Operation Types are allowed for a node, only the
appropriate letters are used (i.e. SIS or E) as indicated in the table
heading. The omission of an Operation Type for a particular field is marked
with \"-\" (i.e. SI-E). Also, when an entire field is not allowed in a node
the entire cell is marked as \"-\".

### 6.3.3 Detailed message format for online charging
The following table specifies per Operation Type the charging data that are
sent by each of the IMS Network Elements for:
> \- IMS session and IMS event (I/U/T/E)
>
> IMS-GWF, AS
>
> \- IMS session only (I/U/T)
>
> MRFC
The Operation Types are listed in the following order: I (Initial)/U
(Update)/T (Terminate)/E (Event). Therefore, when all Operation Types are
possible it is marked as IUTE. If only some Operation types are allowed for a
node, only the appropriate letters are used (i.e. IUT or E) as indicated in
the table heading. The omission of an Operation Type for a particular field is
marked with \"-\" (i.e. IU-E). Also, when an entire filed is not allowed in a
node the entire cell is marked as \"-\".
Note that not for all structured fields the individual field members are
listed in the table. Detailed descriptions of the fields are provided in TS
32.299 [50].
Table 6.3.3.1 illustrates the basic structure of the supported fields in the

###### ## Annex B (informative): Message flows for service termination by OCS
# B.0 General
This annex describes several scenarios related to IMS service termination in
IMS-GWF.
SIP messages and Diameter transactions associated with these charging
scenarios are shown primarily to illustrate the service termination
procedures. They are not intended to be exhaustive and depend on the Diameter
CCR triggers configured by the operator. The triggers for sending Debit /
Reserve Units Requests from the IMS-GWF to the OCS are defined according to
table 5.3.1.1.
# B.1 Scenario 1 - session related (SCUR): service termination on reception of
an initial SIP INVITE request
Figure B.1.1: Service termination triggered by an initial SIP request
# B.2 Scenario 2 - session related (SCUR): service termination triggered after
an early SIP dialog is established
Figure B.2.1: Service termination triggered by the SIP 200OK response to the
initial SIP INVITE
Figure B.2.2: Service termination triggered by an SIP UPDATE request within an
early SIP dialog
Figure B.2.3: Service termination triggered by the SIP 200OK to an SIP UPDATE
request within an early SIP dialog
# B.3 Scenario 3 - session related (SCUR): service termination triggered after
a confirmed SIP dialog is established
Figure B.3.1: Service termination triggered by a SIP RE-INVITE request within
a confirmed SIP dialog
Figure B.3.2: Service termination triggered by the SIP 200 OK response to a
SIP RE-INVITE request within a confirmed SIP dialog
Figure B.3.3: Service termination triggered by the charging application
procedures as defined in TS 32.299 [50] within a confirmed SIP dialog
## B.4 Scenario 4 - session unrelated (ECUR): service termination on reception
of an initial non-INVITE SIP request
Figure B.4.1: Service termination triggered by the reception of a non-INVITE
SIP request
# B.5 Scenario 5 - session unrelated (IEC): service termination on reception
of an initial non-INVITE SIP request
Figure B.5.1: Service termination triggered by the reception of a non-INVITE
SIP request
