# 4 Data formats for Multi-Vendor Plug and Connect (MvPnC)
## 4.1 MvPnC client identification in DHCP requests
The eNB performing the Initial IP Autoconfiguration procedure specified in
clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 32.508 [5] identifies itself as MvPnC compatible DHCP
client by using the Vendor Class Identifier DHCP option specified in clause
9.13 of RFC 2132 [9] in the following way:
\- DHCP option code 60;
\- Length 5 bytes;
\- Vendor class identifier \"MvPnC\".
The use of Vendor Class Identifier DHCP option with specific value for MvPnC
is illustrated in table 4.1.1.

## 4.2 MvPnC entities information in DHCP replies
### 4.2.1 General
The information that eNB receives from the DHCP server while performing the
Initial IP Autoconfiguration procedure specified in clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS
32.508 [5] may be classified in two categories: basic IP configuration and
MvPnC specific configuration.
The basic IP configuration information is documented in RFC 2131 [8] and RFC
2132 [9] and may include the following:
\- IP address (\"yiaddr\" field in [8]);
\- Subnet Mask (option 1 in [9]);
\- Router(s) (option 3 in [9]);
\- IP address(es) of the DNS server(s) (option 6 in [9]);
\- Domain Name (option 15 in [9]).
The MvPnC specific configuration information is described in detail in clauses
4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.2.4.
The DHCP option \"Vendor Specific Information\" specified in the clause 8.4 of
RFC 2132 [9] is used as an opaque container carrying the MvPnC specific
configuration from the DHCP server to the eNB performing the MvPnC procedure.
The multiple pieces of MvPnC specific configuration within the Vendor Specific
Information container are encoded as a sequence of code/length/value fields
(also known as \"Encapsulated vendor-specific options\" specified in clause
8.4 of RFC 2132 [9]).
The use of Vendor Specific Information DHCP option container with encapsulated
vendor-specific options encoding is illustrated in table 4.2.1.1.
Table 4.2.1.1: Use of the Vendor Specific Information
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+ | Code | L | V | | | | | | | | | ength | endor | | | | | | | | | | Spe | | | | | | | | | 1-255 | cific | | | | | | | | | | I | | | | | | | | | | nform | | | | | | | | | | ation | | | | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+ | | | Con | Con | ... | | | | | | | | figur | figur | | | | | | | | | ation | ation | | | | | | | | | attr | attr | | | | | | | | | ibute | ibute | | | | | | | | | 1 | 2 | | | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+ | 43 | n | Type1 | Le | Data | Type2 | Le | Data | ... | | | | | nght1 | | | ngth2 | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+ | octet | octet | octet | octet | n | octet | octet | n | ... | | | | | | o | | | o | | | | | | | ctets | | | ctets | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+
The content of the configuration attributes (specific type code value, valid
length and data type) carried in the format illustrated in table 4.2.1.1 is
specified in the clauses 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 of the present document.
If the size of MvPnC configuration data contained in \"Vendor Specific
Information\" option 43 is greater than 255 bytes, the RFC 3396 [10] encoding
is used.
To avoid ambiguity in the interpretation of string MvPnC configuration
attributes, the ASCII character encoding shall be used.
Standard network byte order shall be used with appropriate conversion function
at the eNB (matching the local little-endian / big-endian byte order).
Some MvPnC configuration attributes may be missing (e.g. the SeGW FQDN
attribute may be not present if the SeGW IP address is present) or just have
zero length (type octet followed by length octet with value zero and no data
octets).
The qualifiers identifying which attributes are mandatory, Optional (O),
Conditional Mandatory (CM) or Conditional Optional (CO) and corresponding
conditions are defined it the clauses 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.2.4.
The order of MvPnC configuration attributes is not important (e.g. attribute
of type \"1\" may appear after the attribute of type \"5\").
### 4.2.2 Certification Authority (CA/RA) server

that eNB receives from DHCP server in Initial IP Autoconfiguration procedure

## 4.3 MvPnC entities Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN)
### 4.3.1 General
This clause describes the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) used in Multi
Vendor Plug and Connect (MvPnC) procedures.
The FQDNs used in MvPnC are in the form of a domain name as specified in IETF
RFC 1035 [7].
The sub-domains used in MvPnC are allocated within the \".3gppnetwork.org\"
domain.\ The GSM Association is in charge of allocating the new sub-domains of
\".3gppnetwork.org\" domain name.\ The procedure specified in Annex E of 3GPP
TS 23.003 [6] is used for the sub-domain allocation.
The FQDNs used in MvPnC follow the general encoding rules specified in clause
19.4.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [6].
The format of FQDNs used in MvPnC follows the \"\.\.\\" pattern.
NOTE: Where \"\.\.oam\" represents the \ shown
in the first row of table E.1 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [6].
The \ label is optional and is required in the operator deployments
where multiple instances of a particular network entity type are not provided
by the same vendor. If present, the \ label is in the form
\"vendor\\", where \ field corresponds to the ID of the vendor. The
specific deployment scenario (e.g. one network entity instance per vendor or
one network entity instance for all vendors) is not known to the eNB when it
connects to the network. Therefore, it should first try to resolve the FQDN
containing the \ label and if it fails, try to resolve the FQDN
without the \ label.
The details of the \ label are described in clauses 4.3.2, 4.3.3 and
4.3.4.
The \ label is the operator\'s OAM realm domain name in the form of
\"oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org\", where \"\\" and \"\\"
fields correspond to the MNC and MCC of the operator\'s PLMN. Both the
\"\\" and \"\\" fields are 3 digits long. If the MNC of the PLMN is
2 digits, then a zero shal be added at the beginning.
An example of an OAM realm domain name is:
MCC = 123;
MNC = 45;
Which gives the OAM realm domain name: \"oam.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\".
### 4.3.2 Certification Authority (CA/RA) server
The Certification Authority server (CA/RA) FQDN is derived as follows. The
\"cara\" \ label is added in front of the operator\'s OAM realm domain
name:
cara.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
If particular operator deployment scenario has multiple CA/RA servers (one per
vendor), the \ label is added in front of the \"cara\" label:
vendor\.cara.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
An example of a CA/RA FQDN is:
MCC = 123;
MNC = 45;
ViD = abcd;
Which gives the CA/RA FQDN: \"cara.oam.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\" and
\"vendorabcd.cara.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\".
### 4.3.3 Security Gateway (SeGW)
The Security Gateway (SeGW) FQDN is derived as follows.\ The \"segw\"
\ label is added in front of the operator\'s OAM realm domain name:
segw.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
If particular operator deployment scenario has multiple Security Gateways (one
per vendor), the \ label is added in front of the \"segw\" label:
vendor\.segw.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
An example of a SeGW FQDN is:
MCC = 123;
MNC = 45;
ViD = abcd;
Which gives the SeGW FQDN: \"segw.oam.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\" and
\"vendorabcd.segw.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\".
### 4.3.4 Element Manager (EM)
The Element Manager (EM) FQDN is derived as follows.\ The \"em\" \
label is added in front of the operator\'s OAM realm domain name:
em.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
If particular operator deployment scenario has multiple Element Managers (one
per vendor), the \ label is added in front of the \"em\" label:
vendor\.em.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
An example of a EM FQDN is:
MCC = 123;
MNC = 45;
ViD = abcd;
Which gives the EM FQDN: \"em.oam.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\" and
\"vendorabcd.em.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\".
