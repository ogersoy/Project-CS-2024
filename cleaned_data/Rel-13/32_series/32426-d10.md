The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor LTE SAE-system.
During the lifetime of a LTE SAE network, its logical and physical
configuration will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order
to optimise the utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be
executed through network configuration management activities and/or network
engineering, see TS 32.600 [2].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a LTE SAE network require data on which to base decisions. This
data refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service
offered. In order to produce this data performance measurements are executed
in the NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an
external system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for
further evaluation. The purpose of the present document is to describe the
mechanisms involved in the collection of the data and the definition of the
data itself.
Annex B of TS 32.404 helps in the definition of new performance measurements
that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and inclusion in the
present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 discusses a top-down performance
measurement definition methodology that focuses on how the end-user of
performance measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for EPC and combined
EPC/UMTS/GSM.\ TS 32.401 [1] describes Performance Management concepts and
requirements.\ The present document is valid for all measurement types
provided by an implementation of an EPC network and combined EPC/UMTS/GSM
network. Only measurement types that are specific to EPC or combined
EPC/UMTS/GSM networks are defined within the present documents.
Vendor specific measurement types used in EPC and combined EPC/UMTS/GSM
networks are not covered. Instead, these could be applied according to
manufacturer\'s documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as IP) as described by
\"external\" standards bodies (e.g. IETF) shall only be referenced within this
specification, wherever there is a need identified for the existence of such a
reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. MME related measurements);
\- Header 2: Measurement function;
\- Header 3: Measurements.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Use case for measurements
# A.1 Use case for mobility management related measurements
A UE/user needs to register with the network to receive services that require
registration. This registration is described as Network Attachment. The
always-on IP connectivity for UE/users of the EPS is enabled by establishing a
default EPS bearer during Network Attachment. The PCC rules applied to the
default EPS bearer may be predefined in the PDN GW and activated in the
attachment by the PDN GW itself. The Attach procedure may trigger one or
multiple Dedicated Bearer Establishment procedures to establish dedicated EPS
bearer(s) for that UE. During the attach procedure, the UE may request for an
IP address allocation. Terminals utilising only IETF based mechanisms for IP
address allocation are also supported.
If user or subscriber cannot attach to the PS network of EPC, they cannot
access network, so they may complain about quality of service provided by EPC
network. So it is necessary to define attach related measurements to evaluate
network attchment performance of EPC network by attchment success rate.
If inter RAT handover fails, it will lead to call drop. So the measurements
related to inter RAT handover are useful to identify the problems in core
network, sometimes signalling transmitted in core network will be lost or
error because of some unknown reasons. Also for incoming inter RAT handover
cases, if MME decides not to allow incoming handover, MME will not send
related message to eNodeB, so incoming handover failure will not be counted
from EUTRAN measurement. Inter RAT handover related measurements based on MME
will cover cases handover from eNodeB to RNC or BSC or CDMA2000 and vice
versa. So it is necessary to define inter RAT handover related measurements.
# A.2 Use case for detach related measurements
The detach procedure is used by the UE to detach only for EPS services or to
detach for both EPS services and non-EPS services or only for non-EPS services
via a combined detach procedure. Also the detach procedure can be used by the
network to inform the UE that it does not have access to the EPS any longer.
Three detach procedures are provided when the UE accesses the EPS through
E-UTRAN. The first detach procedure is UE-initiated detach procedure and other
detach procedures are network-initiated detach procedures, which are MME-
initiated detach procedure and HSS-initiated detach procedure respectively.
The detach procedure shall be invoked by the UE if the UE is switched off, the
USIM card is removed from the UE or the EPS capability or CS fallback
capability of the UE is disabled. The detach procedure shall be invoked by the
network if the UE is illegal or GPRS services are not allowed in this PLMN and
etc. The UE is detached either explicitly or implicitly. Explicit detach means
that the network or the UE explicitly requests detach and signal with each
other; implicit detach means that the network detaches the UE without
notifying the UE, which is typically the case when the network presumes that
it is not able to communicate with the UE, e.g. due to radio conditions.
If the detach procedure is performed, the EPS bearer context(s) for this
particular UE are deactivated locally without peer-to-peer signalling between
the UE and the MME.
Due to different EMM causes, the detach procedures are invoked by the UE or
the network. In order to estimate the relative performance of detach of EPC
network, it is necessary to define detach related measurements by detach
success rate.
# A.3 Use case for tracking and routeing area update related measurements
If a user fails upating the Tracking Area or Routeing Area, it may not be able
to attach to the new Tracking Area or Routeing Area, and then the user
experience would be very intolerable. Since MME determines to relocate S-GW
based on S-GW service area, which is composed of TAs or RAs, it is assumed
that S-GW service area is already known in MMEs. If the MME identifies that
the new TA or RA is out of the scope of S-GW service area, it shall perform
inter S-GW Tracking or Routeing Area Update procedure, otherwise, it shall
perform intra S-GW Tracking or Routeing Area Update procedure.
Thus it is necessary to define Tracking or Routeing Area Update related
measurements includes both Inter and Intra S-GW Tracking or Routeing Area
Update procedures to evaluate network tracking or Routeing area update
performance of EPC network by calculate success rate.
# A.4 Use case for session related measurements
The purpose of the dedicated bearer context activation procedure is to
establish an EPS bearer context with specific QoS and TFT (Traffic Flow
Template) between the UE and the EPC. The dedicated EPS bearer context
activation procedure is initiated by the network, but may be requested by the
UE by means of the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure. The
dedicated bearer context activation procedure can be part of the attach
procedure, and if the attach procedure fails, the UE shall consider that the
dedicated bearer activation has implicitly failed.
The purpose of the EPS bearer context modification procedure is to modify an
EPS bearer context with a specific QoS and TFT. The EPS bearer context
modification procedure is initiated by the network in order to either modify
the QoS, the TFT, or both. The EPS bearer context modification procedure is
initiated by the network, but it may be initiated as part of the UE requested
bearer resource allocation procedure.
The purpose of the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is to deactivate
an EPS bearer context or disconnect from a PDN by deactivating all EPS bearer
contexts to the PDN. The EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is
initiated by the network, and it may be triggered by the UE by means of the UE
requested bearer resource release procedure or UE requested PDN disconnect
procedure.
If users or subscribers cannot use the services provided by EPS successfully,
the users' subjective feel to the network is influenced. So it is necessary to
define session related measurements to evaluate session performance of EPC
network.
# A.5 Use case for EPS paging procedures
Paging success rate is one of the important performance indicators for network
performance analysis. It measures the paging response acceptance rate when the
CN believes that the mobile is in the coverage area and pages the mobile to
find the terminating mobile party to complete the incoming call. If the paging
success rate is too low, network access success rate will be impacted. Paging
success rate is calculated by paging related measurements. So it is necessary
to define paging related measurements.
# A.6 Use case of PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer Creation related
measurements for EPC
As PDN-GW is the element that initiate the dedicated bearer, if PDN-GW can not
activate the dedicated bearer, then users or subscribers cannot use the
services provided by EPS successfully, which will influence the users'
subjective feel to the network. So it is necessary to define PDN-GW initiated
Dedicated Bearer Creation related measurements to evaluate session performance
of EPC network.
# A.7 Use case of PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer Deletion related
measurements for EPC
The PDN-GW shall be able to delete the dedicated bearer to release more
network resources. If the PDN-GW can not delete the dedicated bearer, then the
valid network resource for user will become less and less which may leads to
system crash. So it is necessary to define PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer
Deletion related measurements to evaluate session performance of EPC network.
# A.8 Use case of PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer Modification with QoS
Update related measurements for EPC
The PDN-GW shall be able to update the dedicated bearer to modify an EPS
bearer with a specific QoS and TFT, if PDN-GW can not update QoS and TFT, then
users or subscribers cannot achieve better network resource and the PDN-GW
cannot map the service flow to the appropriate bearer, which will influence
the users' subjective feel to the network. So it is necessary to define PDN-GW
initiated Dedicated Bearer Modification with QoS Update related measurements
to evaluate session performance of EPC network.
# A.9 Use case of PDN-GW initiated Dedicated Bearer Modification without QoS
Update related measurements for EPC
The PDN-GW shall be able to update the dedicated bearer to modify an EPS
bearer with a specific TFT, if PDN-GW can not update TFT, then the PDN-GW
cannot map the service flow to the appropriate bearer, which will influence
the users' subjective feel to the network. So it is necessary to define PDN-GW
initiated Dedicated Bearer Modification without QoS Update related
measurements to evaluate session performance of EPC network.
# A.10 Use case of GTP S5/S8 data volume related measurements
GTP S5/S8 related measurements are used to measure data volume on S5/S8
interface including incoming and outgoing of data and signalling packets
without counting the mandatory part of the GTP header.
It is useful to analyze transport bandwidth usage of S5/S8 interface. If the
transport bandwidth usage is too high, more bandwidth should be deployed. Also
from the ratio of signaling to data bandwidth usage, it is useful to analyze
network performance, such as if the ratio of them is too high, some abnormal
events are possible happened, GTP S5/S8 related measurements should be
together with other performance measurements to analysis network performance
to find out the abnormal events.
So it is necessary to define GTP S5/S8 related measurements.
# A.11 Use case of S1-U data volume related measurements
S1-U related measurements are used to measure data volume on S1-U interface
including incoming and outgoing of GTP data packets and octets without
counting the mandatory part of he GTP-U header
It is useful to analyze transport bandwidth usage of S1-U interface. If the
transport bandwidth usage is too high, more bandwidth should be deployed, or
load balance should be considered according to core network dimension if there
are multiple S-GWs connected to multiple eNodeBs.
So it is necessary to define S1-U related measurements.
# A.12 Use case of SGi related measurements for EPC
SGi related measurements are used to measure data volume on SGi interface
including incoming and outgoing of IP data packets and octets.
It is useful to analyze transport bandwidth usage of SGi interface. If the
transport bandwidth usage is too high, more bandwidth should be deployed.
So it is necessary to define SGi related measurements.
# A.13 Use case of subscriber management for MME related measurements
Subscriber management includes Insert Subscriber Data and Delete Subscriber
Data related measurements that are useful to monitor network performance. For
example, a surge of insert or delete subscriber data messages can occur if
there is a failure/recovery of a MME, or an operator controlled modification
of a large number of subscriber profiles (e.g. to include a new service). Such
an increase could lead to overload of signaling network elements, which would
otherwise operate efficiently with the available resources.
Since number of subscriber is one of MME capacity indicators, number of
subscribers in ECM-IDLE and ECM-CONNECTED state is very useful to learn the
load of MME. Measurement object based on TA is needed, especially in the case
of MME pool.
So it is necessary to define subscriber management for MME related
measurements.
# A.14 Use case of S1-MME data volume related measurements
S1-MME related measurements are used to measure data volume on S1-MME
interface including incoming and outgoing of IP data packets and octets.
It is useful to analyze transport bandwidth usage of S1-MME interface. If the
transport bandwidth usage is too high, more bandwidth should be deployed, or
load balance should be considered according to core network dimension if there
are multiple MMEs connected to multiple eNodeBs.
So it is necessary to define S1-MME data volume related measurements.
# A.15 Use case of Active EPS Bearers related measurements for EPC
Active EPS Bearers related measurements in PDN GW include the mean and maximum
number of active EPS Bearers created by PDN GW in QCI level.
The former could reflect the general load condition of PDN GW, which could
help the operator for network optimization and load balance. The latter could
reflect that whether the capacity of PDN GW should be extended or not, if the
maximum number approaches or exceeds the equipment capacity, the operator
should consider deploying more capacity or adding new equipment, otherwise it
will impact the success rate for user EPS bearer activation.
# A.16 Use case of MME control of overload related measurements for EPC
Under unusual circumstances or overload situations, the MME shall restrict the
load that its eNodeBs are generating on it using OVERLOAD START message. When
the MME has recovered and wishes to increase its load, the MME sends OVERLOAD
STOP messages to the eNodeB(s).
The counters should be incremented for each OVERLOAD START message and for
each OVERLOAD STOP message sent to an eNodeB respectively, and the severity of
the unusual or overload conditions could be reflected by the values of the
counters. For Operators, they need to know the probabilities of overload in
MME to ensure that the capacity of MME can meet the requirements of
subscribers in most cases. So MME control of overload related measurements are
very useful for operator and could help operator to monitor unusual or
overload conditions, and also estimate the severity of the conditions. Using
the measurements, the operator could analyze whether some problems exist in
the network or not, and may find out abnormal events leaded to the bad
conditions, finally resolve the problems.
# A.17 Use case of UE requested bearer resource modification related
measurements for EPC
The purpose of UE requested bearer resource modification related measurements
for EPC procedure is to request for a modification of bearer resources for one
traffic flow aggregate with a specific QoS demand, or for the modification of
the packet filters used for an active traffic flow aggregate, without changing
QoS.
For example, if the subscribers cannot obtain the QoS resource that they have
requested, and the subjective feel of the subscribers to the network may be
influenced, but on the other hand, the resource of the network is limited and
the subscribers' demand could not be always satisfied. Based on the UE
requested bearer resource modification related measurements, operators can get
the success rate of UE requested bearer resource modification, which can help
opertors find a balance point between the network resource and user
experience, and then the operators could optimize the user experience and also
network quality. The failure UE requested bearer resource modification can be
used also in trouble shooting when necessary.
# A.18 Use case for registered subscribers related measurements for EPC
The UE state in the MME enters the EMM-REGISTERED state by a successful TAU
procedure for a UE selecting an E-UTRAN cell from GERAN/UTRAN or by an Attach
procedure via E-UTRAN. In the EMM-REGISTERED state, the UE can receive
services that require registration in the EPS. And the UE location is known in
the MME to at least an accuracy of the tracking area list allocated to that UE
(excluding some abnormal cases). Operators shall have the knowledge of the
number of registered subscribers in MME to evaluate the capacity status of
MME.
# A.19 Use case of PDN Connections related measurements for EPC
A PDN connection defines the association between a UE represented by one IP
address and a PDN represented by a APN.Different kinds of services may be
located in different PDN, and the users may access specific service via the
specific APN. For example, APN1 is for Internet service accessed by laptop,
and then APN2 is for WAP service accessed by mobile phone.
PDN Connections related measurements per APN, including mean and max number of
PDN Connections, could provide an approach for the operator to monitor the
amount of PDN Connections for specific APN and make the operators know whether
the services located in specific PDN are accepted and enjoyed by the
subscribers or not.
# A.20 Use case of MME processor usage
When network is very busy, for example on important holiday or emergency
events happened, the traffic of one MME is very heavy. So MME processor usage
measurements are very important to indicate MME processor load capability. If
MME processors usage is too high, operator must take action to avoid network
paralysis.
# A.21 Use case for EPS Service Request related Measurements
Service Request procedure is one of the important NAS procedure which is
triggered by the UE when it is idle state and has some data to send or
receive(after the paging procedure).
There should be a good success rate of the procedure; failing so, would affect
the user experience of not sending / receiving the data.
When the UE is in idle state and has some user data pending to be sent,
Service Request procedure is triggered by sending the NAS Service Request
message to the MME. When the MME Accepts, it would request radio / S1 bearers
to be established.
Similarly When the UE is in idle state and the Network has some user data to
be sent, Paging procedure is triggered, which when accepted by UE, would
trigger the Service Request procedure. In other words, Paging Success can be
considered as Service Request procedure initiated by the Network.
# A.22 Use case for session management based on SGW related Measurements
If EPS bearer can not be created, then users or subscribers cannot use the
services provided by EPS successfully. If EPS bearer can not be updated with a
specific QoS and TFT, users or subscribers cannot achieve better network
resource. It will influence the users' subjective feel to the network. Also
from EPS bearer creation / modification based on SGW related measurements it
is useful to evaluate EPS bearer creation or modification success rate on the
S4/S11/S5/S8 interface respectively. So it is necessary to define session
management based on SGW related measurements.
# A.23 Use case for MBMS session related measurements
The purpose of the MBMS session start procedure is to establish the bearer
resource for MBMS data transfer. If this session can not be created, then
users or subscribers cannot use the MBMS services provided by EPS
successfully. It will influence the users' subjective feel to the network.
Also from MBMS bearer creation based on MBMS GW related measurements, it is
useful to evaluate MBMS bearer creation success rate. So it is necessary to
define MBMS session related measurements.
# A.24 Use case of SGW bearer deletion related measurements
The SGW shall be able to delete the bearers to release the network resources.
If the SGW can not delete the bearers, then the valid network resource for
user will become less and less, and it will cuase the bearers can't be
activated, and then the users cannot use the services provided by EPS
successfully. So it is necessary to define SGW Bearer Deletion related
measurements to evaluate the invalid usage of the bearer resource.
# A.25 Use case of bearer resource usage related measurements
The number of bearers is an important capacity parameter for SGW. If bearer
resource is insufficient, the SGW can not activate the bearer,then the users
cannot use the services provided by EPS successfully, which will influence the
users' subjective feel to the network. So it is necessary to define usage of
bearer resource related measurements to evaluate whether the capacity of SGW
should be extended or not.
# A.26 Use case for M1 data volume related measurements
The measuerments of data volume on M1 is useful to evaluate the throughput
capacity of MBMS GW. If the capacity is not enough, the MBMS GW may need to be
extended or load balance should be considered according to core network
dimension if there are multiple MBMS GW connected to multiple eNodeBs. So it
is necessary to define M1 data volume related measurements.
# A.27 Use case for combined TA/LA update procedure related measurements
The CS fallback (CSFB) in EPS enables the provision of voice and other CS-
domain services by reuse of the CS infrastructure. When a CS fallback capable
UE is EPS/IMSI attached, it initiates the combined TA/LA procedure based on
the triggers specified in TS 23.401 and when a CS fallback and/or SMS over SGs
capable UE is not EPS/IMSI attached, it may initiate a combined TA/LA
procedure in order to use CS Fallback or SMS over SGs services.If a CSFB
capable user fails to perform the combined TA/LA update procedure, the user
may not be able to use the CS-domain services, and if the success rate is low
the user experience would be bad. So it is necessary to define combined TA/LA
update procedure related measurements to evaluate the combined TA/LA update
performance of EPC network by calculating the success rate.
# A.28 Use case of S4 data volume related measurements
GTP S4 related measurements are used to measure data volume on S4 interface
including incoming and outgoing packets.It is useful to analyze transport
bandwidth usage of S4 interface. If the transport bandwidth usage is too high,
more bandwidth of S4 interface should be deployed or the operator can decide
to deploy the optional S12 interface between UTRAN and SGW if S12 interface
doesn't exist. So it is necessary to define GTP S4 data volume related
measurements.
# A.29 Use case of S12 data volume related measurements
S12 related measurements are used to measure data volume on S12 interface
including incoming and outgoing of GTP data packets and octets. It is useful
to analyze transport bandwidth usage of S12 interface. If the transport
bandwidth usage is too high, more bandwidth should be deployed. So it is
necessary to define S12 related measurements.
# A.30 Use case of implicit detach related measurements
This measurement provides the number of implicit detach procedures initiated
by MME. After the mobile reachable timer expires, the MME may initiate an
implicit detach procedure in order to return the EMM contexts in the MME to
EMM-DEREGISTERED state. Normally, an appropriate configuration of the timer
will make the ratio of the number of implicit detach procedures to the total
number of detach procedures at the MME side increase and decrease around a
specific value resulting in an acceptable quality of service for the users. If
an incorrect configuration of the timer results in this ratio being too high,
the users will be implicitly detached a large number of times while using a
certain application service. This is one of the issues of mobility management
and the user's experience will be impaired. Furthermore, this measurement
could help operators to analyse users' behaviour when the ratio has changed
considerably during a specific time interval.
# A.31 Use case for IP-CAN session establishment related measurements
IP-CAN session is association between a UE and an IP network. An IP-CAN
session incorporates one or more IP-CAN bearers. So IP-CAN session success
rate is an important performance indicator of IP network, it can be calculated
from attempted and successful IP-CAN session establishment measurement. And
failed IP-CAN session establishment measurement is useful to locate trouble.
So it is necessary to define attempted, successful and failed IP-CAN session
establishment measurements.
# A.32 Use case for credit re-authorization procedure related measurements
Re-Auth-Request (RAR) Command is sent by the PCRF to the PCEF in order to
provision PCC rules using the PUSH procedure initiate the provision of
unsolicited PCC rules. It is used to provision PCC rules, event triggers and
event report indications for the session. So credit re-authorization success
rate is an important performance indicator of initiation the provision of
unsolicited PCC rules, it can be calculated from attempted and successful
credit re-authorization measurement. And failed credit re-authorization
measurement is useful to locate trouble. So it is necessary to define
attempted, successful and failed credit re-authorization measurements.
# A.33 Use case for IP-CAN session related measurements
IP-CAN session is association between a UE and an IP network. An IP-CAN
session incorporates one or more IP-CAN bearers. So IP-CAN session
establishment and termination success rate is an important performance
indicator of IP network. IP-CAN session establishment success rate can be
calculated from attempted and successful IP-CAN session establishment
measurement. IP-CAN session termination success rate can be calculated from
attempted and successful IP-CAN session termination measurement. Failed IP-CAN
session establishment measurement is useful to locate trouble. So it is
necessary to define attempted, successful and failed IP-CAN session
establishment and attempted, successful termination measurements.
# A.34 Use case for update location related measurements
The Update Location Procedure is used between the MME and the HSS and between
the SGSN and the HSS to update location information in the HSS. The procedure
shall be invoked by the MME or SGSN and is used:
\- to inform the HSS about the identity of the MME or SGSN currently serving
the user, and optionally in addition;
\- to update MME or SGSN with user subscription data;
\- to provide the HSS with other user data, such as Terminal Information.
At timer expired, update location message will be sent several times if no
answer received, and all procedures will be used to calculate update location
success rate. If the update location success rate between MME and HSS is very
low, the user data in HSS will be not aligned with the fact. Therefore it is
necessary to define attempted and successful update location performance
measurements to calculate update location success rate. The failed update
location performance measurement is useful to do trouble shooting.
# A.35 Use case for authentication information retrieval related measurements
The Authentication Information Retrieval Procedure is used by the MME to
request Authentication Information from the HSS. At timer expired,
authentication information request will be sent several times if no answer
received, and all procedures will be used to calculate Authentication
Information Retrieval success rate. If the Authentication Information
Retrieval success rate is very low, user experience will be affected, such as
user will wait for a long time or even be rejected to access the network.
Therefore it is important to define attempted and successful authentication
information retrieval performance measurements to calculate authentication
information retrieval success rate. The failed authentication information
retrieval performance is useful to do trouble shooting.
# A.36 Use case for Number of EPS bearer in PGW related measurements
An EPS bearer uniquely identifies traffic flows that receive a common QoS
treatment between a UE and a PDN GW for GTP-based S5/S8, and between UE and
Serving GW for PMIP-based S5/S8. One EPS bearer is established when the UE
connects to a PDN, and that remains established throughout the lifetime of the
PDN connection to provide the UE with always-on IP connectivity to that PDN.
That bearer is referred to as the default bearer. Any additional EPS bearer
that is established for the same PDN connection is referred to as a dedicated
bearer.
The number of EPS bearer in PGW is one of the capacity indicators of PGW
equipment, so it can help operator to decide to increase capacity or not.
#
