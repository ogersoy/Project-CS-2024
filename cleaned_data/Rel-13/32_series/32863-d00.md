# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the metadata for Performance Management (PM)
performance measurements (KPIs/counters). The definition would enforce
consistency in description/definition of all standardized performance
measurements (counters/KPIs) by various SDOs and organizations (or Multi-SDO)
involved in the Management of Converged Networks [6]. This consistency would
facilitate encoding and decoding of performance measurements (counters/KPIs)
exchanged (via management protocols) and/or stored in (database or files).
The metadata related to PM operations/notifications is not part of this PM
measurement metadata.
The present document takes into account the recommendations from the Fixed
Mobile Convergence (FMC) model repertoire [2] developed by the Multi-SDO JWG
on Model Alignment.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**Measurement/Indicator** : A Performance attribute, a type of a parameter
that is measured on a measured object Class.
**Granularity period** : The sampling rate of Performance Measurements (aka
Performance Indicators). This is the rate of producing the measurements as
determined by the Producing Application (aka the Performance server).
**Reporting Period** : The rate (frequency) of collecting Performance
Measurements as determined by the Consuming Application, (aka the Performance
client). The Collection Resolution is an integral multiple of the
corresponding granularity.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR
21.905 [1] and the following apply.\ An abbreviation defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if
any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].

# 4 Requirements
Metadata is defined as data providing information about aspects of other data.
Metadata can be exchanged in protocols, and can be stored and managed in a
database, often called a Metadata registry or Metadata repository. Metadata
can be defined in machine-readable syntax.
The PM performance measurement metadata is the properties of the performance
measurements (counters/KPIs) including their associations to other performance
measurements (counters/KPIs). The number of properties and the level of the
details in the property definition depend on the metadata intended usage.
The purpose for defining the PM performance measurement metadata is to enforce
a consistency in description/definition of all standardized counters/KPIs.
This consistency facilitates encoding, decoding, interpreting and in general,
processing of counters/KPIs defined by Multi-SDOs involved in the Management
of Converged Networks.
# 5 Definition of Performance Measurement Metadata
The table 5.1 provides the PM performance measurement metadata; i.e., the
definition of the properties.
When defining a new measurement and when this new measurement is similar to a
measurement already defined in another standard, then this standard should be
referenced and only the missing properties should be defined in addition.
Note: The following shortcuts are used in the table. Gen= GenericMeasurement,
Counter=CounterMeasurement, KPI=KPIMeasurement.
Table 5.1

###### ### Annex A: Measurement Profile
The converged metadata defined in the clause 5 are defined in a UML profile to
use them as templates for defining measurement instances.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="6.6625in"}
Figure A.1: Measurement Profile
The profile is associated to the Class metaclass on a case by case basis. This
allows a model designer to define individual measurement instances. See an
example below:
