## 5.4 High level use cases
### 5.4.1 HeNB Energy Saving use cases
**UC1a: Capacity-Limited Networks**
**Capacity-limited networks are normally dimensioned to cope with peak time
traffic demand and can hence be under-utilized in off-peak times peak time
traffic demand e.g. at certain hours of the night, when the overall load as
well as the load distribution onto the different cells may differ
significantly from peak times.**
**For energy saving management in such networks, the objective is therefore to
adapt the network to these changing conditions by activating energy saving on
selected cells. One approach is to concentrate the load into a few selected**
cells **that remain active during low traffic demand periods with increased
coverage area and to deactivate the remaining less loaded** cells**.**
UC1b: Hybrid E-UTRAN Macro Cell and HeNB Cell Coverage
A variation of the above use case is to have all cells in the building can be
shut down. The overlay macro cell can provide coverage for all the HeNBs in
that area.
Depending on the architecture, energy saving decisions and corresponding state
transfers are made by network elements (or element / domain managers) or by
network management systems.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Energy Saving use cases for HeNB
# A.1 UC1a: Capacity-Limited Networks
**Capacity-limited networks are normally dimensioned to cope with peak time
traffic demand and can hence be under-utilized in off-peak times peak time
traffic demand e.g. at certain hours of the night, when the overall load as
well as the load distribution onto the different cells may differ
significantly from peak times.**
**For energy saving management in such networks, the objective is therefore to
adapt the network to these changing conditions by activating energy saving on
selected cells. One approach is to concentrate the load into a few selected**
cells **that remain active during low traffic demand periods with increased
coverage area and to deactivate the remaining less loaded** cells**.**
HeNBs are ideal candidates for policy based energy saving. For this use case
let us consider an office building where there are several HeNBs deployed.
Figure A.1-1
Offices are generally closed between 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM. A policy based energy
saving can be used to shut down cells that would not have any traffic during
these times. Depending on the need one of cells can provide minimum coverage
for the building.

variation for energy saving purposes
# A.2 UC 1b: Hybrid E-UTRAN Macro Cell and HeNB Cell Coverage
Alternately, if the building is completely closed for holidays or weekends all
cells in the building can be shut down. The overlay macro cell can provide
coverage for all the HeNBs in that area.

Figure A.2-1
Figure A.2-2: Hybrid E-UTRAN Macro Cell and HeNB Cell Coverage
In this scenario, two E-UTRAN Cells with different cell types cover the same
geographical area. Cell B (HeNB Cell) is covered totally by Cell A (Macro
Cell). Generally, Cell A is deployed by eNB to provide continuous coverage of
the area, while Cell B is deployed by Home eNB to increase the capacity of the
special sub-areas, such as home or business mall or office. The energy saving
procedure in the coverage of Cell B (ES area) may be triggered in case that
light traffic or no traffic in Cell B is detected. Cell B deactivation of
energy saving may also be triggered when the traffic of ES area resumes to a
high level. Home eNB which deploys the HeNB cell can be totally switched off
during the ES procedure.
_Activating energy saving on certain NEs and modifying radio parameters for
increasing coverage for other cells can lead to different neighbor relations
as well as different cell and frequency layouts, which should be addressed by
automatic neighbor relation, interference control, e.g. through OAM-driven
configuration or SON function. Depending on the specific scenarios, activating
energy saving on NEs could ultimately lead to switching off all radio-
transmission-related functions at a site, which would lead to reduced energy
consumption and could implicitly lead to even further energy saving, e.g. when
air condition systems at a site adapt to the reduced cooling requirements --
which is not considered here in detail._
Depending on the architecture, energy saving decisions and corresponding state
transfers are made by network elements (or element / domain managers) or by
network management systems.
