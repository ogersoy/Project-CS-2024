# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [100] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR
21.905 [100].
**chargeable event:** activity utilizing telecommunication network resources
and related services for:
\- user to user communication (e.g. a single call, a data communication
session or a short message); or
\- user to network communication (e.g. service profile administration); or
\- inter-network communication (e.g. transferring calls, signalling, or short
messages); or
\- mobility (e.g. roaming or inter-system handover); and
\- that the network operator may want to charge for.
As a minimum, a chargeable event characterizes the resource / service usage
and indicates the identity of the involved end user(s).
**charged party:** user involved in a chargeable event who has to pay parts or
the whole charges of the chargeable event, or a third party paying the charges
caused by one or all users involved in the chargeable event, or a network
operator.
**charging:** function within the telecommunications network and the
associated OCS/BD components whereby information related to a chargeable event
is collected, formatted, transferred and evaluated in order to make it
possible to determine usage for which the charged party may be billed (offline
charging) or the subscriber\'s account balance may be debited (online
charging).
**charging event:** set of charging information forwarded by the CTF towards
the CDF (offline charging) or towards the OCS (online charging). Each charging
event matches exactly one chargeable event.
**charging function:** entity inside the core network domain, subsystem or
service that is involved in charging for that domain, subsystem or service.
**credit control:** mechanism which directly interacts in real-time with an
account and controls or monitors the charges, related to the service usage.
Credit control is a process of: checking if credit is available, credit
reservation, deduction of credit from the end user account when service is
completed and refunding of reserved credit not used.
**domain:** part of a communication network that provides network resources
using a certain bearer technology.
**\"middle tier\" (charging) TS:** term used for the 3GPP charging TSs that
specify the domain / subsystem / service specific, online and offline,
charging functionality. These are all the TSs in the numbering range from TS
32.250 to TS 32.279, e.g. TS 32.250 [10] for the CS domain, or TS 32.270 [30]
for the MMS service. Currently, there is only one \"tier 1\" TS in 3GPP, which
is TS 32.240 [1] that specifies the charging architecture and principles.
Finally, there are a number of top tier TSs in the 32.29x numbering range
([50] ff) that specify common charging aspects such as parameter definitions,
encoding rules, the common billing domain interface or common charging
applications.
**online charging:** charging mechanism where charging information **can**
affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction
of the charging mechanism with bearer/session/service control is required.
**Online Charging System:** the entity that performs real-time credit control.
Its functionality includes transaction handling, rating, online correlation
and management of subscriber account balances.
**real-time:** real-time charging and billing information is to be generated,
processed, and transported to a desired conclusion in less than 1 second.
**successful call:** connection that reaches the communication or data
transfer phase e.g. the \"answered\" state for speech connections. All other
connection attempts are regarded as unsuccessful.
**voice call:** any Circuit-switched call, whatever the teleservice used
(speech, 3.1 kHz audio, Fax, or CS data) except circuit-switched Video
Telephony calls (BS 37, 64 kbit/s unrestricted digital info mode). Voice over
LTE is not included in this definition.
## 3.2 Symbols
For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:
kbit/s Kilobits per second. 1 kbit/s = 210 bits per second.
Mbit/s Megabits per second. 1 Mbit/s = 220 bits per second.

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 General
This clause describes the requirements for the charging of IMS (VoLTE)
subscribers which are roaming in foreign networks.
With introducing Roaming with loopback in 3GPP IMS the set of charging
specifications TS 32.260 [20], TS 32.298 [51] and TS 32.299 [50] was updated
to cover the additional requirements raised with that work.
Currently we have tool set describing where CDRs are generated to provide a
tool set to fulfil the requirements of the operators which are described in
sub clause 4.2.
Within the present document these requirements will be validated based on
specific roaming scenarios against the existing charging specifications if
they are completely fulfilled.
## 4.2 General Charging Concept
In general, it is assumed that the fundamental principles for charging and
accounting in case of a VoLTE subscriber roaming in foreign network shall be
identical to those that are currently used for GSM/3G roaming.
This is also required in GSMA document GSMA PDR IR.65 [600] indicate: That
\"The charging model for roaming used in CS domain shall be maintained in
VoIMS.\"
From operator\'s point of view, these principles for this include:
\- The roaming subscriber only has a contract with his home network operator
(HPLMN).
\- The roaming subscriber is only charged by his HPLMN operator.
\- \"zonal charging\" (i.e. charging dependent on the distance between call
origin and call destination, \"charge distance\") shall be supported.
\- In MTC scenarios, the called roaming subscriber may be charged for the
terminating leg from HPLMN to VPLMN.
\- Information given within CDRs should allow to calculate the accounting fees
between HPLMN and VPLMN.
\- Inter-connection fees between PLMNs and IC providers are dependent on the
direct interconnection (and on the remaining charge distance).
\- There are roaming charges which should be calculated by the information
given in the CDRs collected.
\- The VPLMN charges the HPLMN for the access of the user.
From operator\'s point of view there is the requirement to have a charging
solution where an optimal use of existing resources, best reliability and
stability is given.
## 4.3 Inter Operator Identifier
### 4.3.1 Type of IOI\'s
TS 32.240 [1] subclause 5.3.4.3 describes the \"Inter-network correlation\".
It introduces the Inter Operator Identification concept (IOI) to enable the
different operators involved in IMS sessions to identify each other.
The IOI concept in TS 32.240 [1] defines the requirement for the handling of
IOI\'s for charging purposes. For this study the following requirements are
important:
\- The IOI concept shall allow operators to uniquely identify each other for
the SIP based requests.
\- It shall be possible to apply the IOI concept on a peer to peer basis
between operators.
\- IOI identities shall be included within SIP signalling where TS 24.229
[106] is describing the signalling procedures for the inclusion of the IOI\'s:
\- When a SIP request is sent out of an IMS network the originating ioi is
included.
\- When a SIP response is returned from an IMS network the terminating ioi is
included.
\- In transit cases transit ioi\'s may be included per transit network. It
should be noted that transit operators can be selected independently for each
SIP method and direction of request.
TS 32.240 [1] defines three types of IOI\'s:
1) Type 1 IOI: between the Home PLMN and a Visited PLMN for an end user in
roaming situation (case when the P-CSCF is located in a visited network). The
network element providing the originating or the terminating Type 1 IOI,
change according to the type of end user and the signalling leg to be
considered.
\- When considering the originating end user, and the signalling leg between
its VPLMN and its HPLMN:
\- P-CSCF is generating the originating IOI;
\- S-CSCF is generating the terminating IOI;
\- enhanced MSC for ISC is generating the originating IOI;
\- When considering the originating end user, and the signalling loopback leg
between its HPLMN and its VPLMN
\- S-CSCF (or BGCF) is generating the originating IOI; and
NOTE 1: TS 24.229 [106] is defining the BGCF case while TS 32.240 [1] not.
\- TRF is generating the terminating IOI.
\- When considering the terminating end user, and the signalling leg between
its VPLMN and its HPLMN:
\- S-CSCF is generating the originating IOI;
\- P-CSCF is generating the terminating IOI;
\- enhanced MSC for ISC is generating the terminating IOI.
2) Type 2 IOI: between the IMS network operator which holds the subscription
of the originating end user and the IMS network operator which holds the
subscription of the terminating end user. For the roaming case with local
breakout Type 2 IOI are used between A\'s Visited PLMN and B\'s Home PLMN:
\- S-CSCF is generating the originating IOI between the originating home
S-CSCF and the terminating home S-CSCF;
\- between the S-CSCF s generating the terminating IOI and the MGCF when a
call/session is terminated at the PSTN/PLMN;
\- between the E-CSCF and the S-CSCF or the IBCF when receiving an emergency
request;
\- MGCF and the S-CSCF is generating the terminating IOI of the home
terminating network when a call/session is originated from the PSTN/PLMN;
NOTE 2: This includes all scenarios with a PSI AS when accessed across I-CSCF;
\- the TRF is generating the originating IOI towards the S-CSCF;
\- the S-CSCF is generating the terminating IOI towards the TRF;
\- MGCF is generating the originating;
\- E-CSCF is generating the originating IOI towards the MGCF or the IBCF where
the request is routed to a PSAP; and
3) Type 3 IOI: between the home IMS network operator and a service provider:
\- The S-CSCF or the I-CSCF is generating the originating IOI of the home
operator network towards any AS; and
\- the AS is generating the terminating IOI towards the S-CSCF and I-CSCF;
\- the AS is generating a originating IOI when initiating a request, and the
S-CSCF and I-CSCF generating the terminating IOI towards the AS;
\- LRF initiates a request to the E-CSCF, the LRF is responsible for
generating the originating IOI; and
\- E-CSCF to the LRF, the E-CSCF is responsible for generating the terminating
IOI;
\- E-CSCF forwards a request to the EATF or to the LRF, the E-CSCF is
responsible for generating the originating IOI;
\- EATF and LRF are responsible for generating the terminating IOI.
### 4.3.2 Format of IOI\'s
According to TS 32.240 [1] subclause 5.3.4.3 defines the requirements for
IOI\'s. The SIP entity generating type 1 and type 3 IOI values express the
\"orig-ioi\" and \"term-ioi\" header field parameters in the format of a
quoted string as specified in IETF draft-drage-sipping-rfc3455bis-13 [403]
with a specific string prefix being \"Type 1\" and \"Type 3\" respectively to
indicate the type of IOI. For the type 2 IOI, no string prefix is used. The
receiving SIP entity does not perform syntactic checking of the contents of
the IOI parameter (the IOI parameter is passed unmodified to charging
entities).
TS 32.240 [1]does not mandate the Type 1 and Type 2 prefixes to \"orig-ioi\"
and \"term-ioi\" header field parameters. The assumption is that also transit-
ioi will apply to these Types. A specific ruling is currently not defined.
Editor\'s note: The use of Type 1 and Type 2 for \"transit-ioi\" has to be
verified or corrected within TS 32.240 [1]. The above described procedure is
not really clear. The type definitions are only referring to originating and
terminating ioi.
The following table shows some examples how to format IOI\'s.

### 4.3.3 Basic IMS roaming scenario without loopback

Figure 4.3.3.1: IOI information exchange for the \"Basic IMS\" roaming case
with home routing of media
In order to meet the requirements of TS 32.240 [1] there needs to be an IOI
exchange including originating IOI, transit IOIs, and terminating IOI for each
of the three signalling paths crossing network boundaries.

### 4.3.4 VPLMN routing IMS roaming scenario with loopback
Within the loopback approach 4 traversal scenarios exist which are shown in
table 4.3.4.1.
Table 4.3.4.1: Traversal scenarios for \"VPLMN routing\ IMS roaming scenario
with loopback\"
* * *
Traversal scenario Type of IOI Originating visited network -- Originating home
network Type 1 Originating home network -- Originating visited network Type 1
Originating visited network -- Terminating home network Type 2 Terminating
home network -- Terminating visited network Type 1
* * *
For roaming with loopback the \"VPLMN routing\" introduces the case where the
SIP signalling and media is routed from the VPLMN to the destination and where
the SIP signalling is first routed to the HPLMN for service execution and then
back to the VPLM to allow the VPLMN to route both sip signalling and media to
the destination.
The complete sequence of IOI exchanges for the IMS roaming scenario with VPLMN
routing option is depicted in Figure 4.3.4.1.
Figure 4.3.4.1: IOI exchange for IMS roaming with VPLMN routing
In order to meet the requirements of TS 32.240 [1] there needs to be an IOI
exchange including originating IOI, transit IOIs, and terminating IOI there
are four signalling paths crossing network boundaries.

### 4.3.5 Rules for Transit-IOI
TS 24.229 [106] describes that for transit networks based on local policy the
additional routeing function in the transit network adds in requests and in
responses the P-Charging-Vector header field a \"transit-ioi\" header field
parameter with an entry which identifies the operator network which the
request or response is transiting or with a void entry.
TS 32.260 [20] defines the Transit-IOI List which cold appear one or more
times within a CDR depending on the amount of transit networks passed.
When the index is calculated then \"void\" entries are taken into account.
Based on local policy the additional routeing function deletes or void in
requests and in responses in the P-Charging-Vector header field any received
\"transit-ioi\" header field parameter value.
Specific ruling may also apply to IBCF:
1\. IBCF acting as entry point:
\- Based on local policy, the IBCF acting as an entry point adds in requests
in the P-Charging-Vector header field a \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter
with an entry which identifies the operator network which the request is
transiting or with a void entry.
\- Based on local policy the IBCF deletes or void in requests in the
P-Charging-Vector header field any received \"transit-ioi\" header field
parameter value.
\- Only one \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter entry is added per transit
network.
2\. IBCF acting as exit point:
\- Based on local policy, the IBCF acting as an exit point adds in responses
in the P-Charging-Vector header field a \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter
with an entry which identifies the operator network which the response is
transiting or with a void entry.
\- Based on local policy the IBCF deletes or void in responses in the
P-Charging-Vector header field any received \"transit-ioi\" header field
parameter value.
The Transit-IOI will included in the Transit-IOI List as defined in TS 32.260
[20].
Considering figure 4.3.5.1 either the IBCF-entryA1 in combination with the
IBCF-exitA1 or the transit function (i.e. additional routing function as
defined within TS 24.229 [106]) can do the setting of the Transit-IOI. But
also due to TS 24.229 [106], subclause 4.5.4A, the transit function can
control if a transit-ioi will be deleted or voided.
Figure 4.3.5.1: IOI exchange for IMS roaming transit
> 1-2. The IBCF-entryA1 receives an SIP INVITE request containing the
> \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter in the P-Charging-Vector header field
> and sends the SIP INVITE request towards the transit function.
NOTE 1: If no \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter is included or if the
included \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter is missing a preceding
interconnection network and the preceding network is an interconnection
network, the IBCF-entryA1 can based on local policy, add the transit-ioi\"
header field parameter with an entry identifying the preceding interconnection
network.

> request is sent to the IBCF-exitT.
NOTE 2: Based on local policy, the transit function can also void entries in
the received \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter.
> 6\. The IBCF-exitA1forwards the INVITE to IBCF-entry B
>
> 7-8.. The final SIP Response 200 (OK) received from the IBCF-entry B with

> transit function.
NOTE 3: If no \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter is included or if the
included \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter is missing a preceding
interconnection network and the preceding network is an interconnection
network, the IBCF-exitT can based on local policy, add the transit-ioi\"
header field parameter with an entry identifying the preceding interconnection
network.
> 9\. The transit function stores and removes the \"transit-ioi\" header field
> parameter from the P-Charging-Vector header field, adds the Relayed-Charge
> header field with the content received in the \"transit-ioi\" and forwards
> the SIP 200 (OK) response to the AS.
>
> 10\. The AS stores the content of the Relayed-Charge header field and sends
> the SIP 200 (OK) response to the transit function.
>
> 11..The transit function removes the Relayed-Charge header field and
> includes the stored \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter in the
> P-Charging-Vector header field. The transit function also appends an entry
> in the \"transit-ioi\". Based on local policy, the appended entry can
> identify the interconnection network or be set to void. The SIP 200 (OK)
> response is sent to the IBCF-entryT.
NOTE 4: Based on local policy, the transit function can also void entries in
the received \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter.
All elements may write CDR\'s as described within TS 32.260 [20]. The
\"Transit-IOI List\" will contain the values as described above. It the
transit network is the second in row. The transit-ioi will contain more than
one entry which is then reflected in the \"Transit-IOI List\".
## 4.4 Inter-level Charging Correlation
### 4.4.1 Definitions
As defined in TS 32.240 [1], inter-level charging correlation combines the
charging events belonging to the same service but generated by different CTFs,
e.g. for PS access control via IM Subsystem. Charging in the IMS domain is
identified by the IMS Charging Identifier (ICID). The ICID, defined as a
globally unique with the IMS network provides an association of the charging
information for the mobile subscriber\'s resource usage. Charging in the PS
domain is identified by the combination of the P-GW address and a Charging Id
that is unique within the P-GW.
For inter-level charging correlation to be possible, the PS domain Charging
Id\'s need to be available as part of the charging information in the IMS
domain and the ICID needs to be available as part of the charging information
in the PS domain.
### 4.4.2 Associating PS Domain Resources with an IMS Session
As per TS 29.214 [214], in order to correlate the associated application usage
of PS bearer level resources, an Application Function (AF), may provide an AF-
Charging-Identifier to the PCRF when authorizing PS domain resources. For IMS,
the AF is the P-CSCF and the identifier is the ICID.
As per TS 29.212 [213], when service identifier level reporting is performed
for a dynamic PCC rule initiated by an AF interaction, the PCRF includes the
AF-Charging-Identifier along with the flow identifiers (also provided by the
AF). The dynamic PCC rule may be installed for the default bearer, a
previously activated dedicated bearer, or a new dedicated bearer to be created
by the PCEF. When the AF provides flow descriptions requiring different QoS
levels, then dynamic PCC rules are generated that will be installed on
different bearers in order to provide the required QoS for each flow. In this
scenario, the same AF charging identifier will be present in multiple PCC
rules. In addition, when two (or more) different AF requests include flows
with the same QoS level, e.g., for call waiting, the associated dynamic PCC
rules will be installed on the same bearer. In this scenario, there will be
multiple AF charging identifiers associated with the shared bearer. If the PCC
rules include the same combination of rating group and service identity, the
reporting will combine the usage in the same information element. The AF
charging identifiers appear in association with the usage report. Note that
this usage report will also include measurement for matching rules with no AF
charging indenter specified.
In TS 32.251 [11], the PGW-CDR, defined for PS domain charging flow-based
charging, contains a list of service data containers. The service data
container, defined in TS 32.298 [51], contains the AF Charging Identifier
within the AF-Record-Information field. When unique Rating-Group and Service-
Identifier combinations are assigned for the bearer resources associated with
an IMS session, this definition provides the ability for the PS domain CDRs to
identify the specific bearer resource utilization associated with an IMS
session, identified by the ICID, by including the ICID information in the
service data containers along with the captured data volumes.
In TS 32.251 [11], the Multiple Unit Operation used for online charging and
bound to the Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP in TS 32.299 [50], also
contains the AF Charging Identifier within the AF-Correlation-Information AVP.
As for offline charging, when unique Rating-Group and Service-Identifier
combinations are assigned for the bearer resources associated with an IMS
session, this definition provides the ability for the P-GW to identify the
specific bearer resource utilization associated with an IMS session,
identified by the ICID, by including the ICID information in the Multiple-
Services-Credit-Control AVP along with the captured data volumes.
### 4.4.3 Associating IMS Session with PS Domain Charging
As per TS 29.214 [214], the AF may subscribe to notification about Access
Network Charging Information from the PCRF. This information will be provided
to the AF in either a direct response to the subscription when the charging
information is known or by a subsequent notification when the charging
information is received from the PCEF. The PCRF notifies the AF of the Access
Network Charging Information that applies to each authorized flow (e.g. audio
and video). The Access Network Charging Information consists of the Access-
Network-Charging-Identifier AVP(s) and may include the Access-Network-
Charging-Address AVP. For LTE, this would contain the EPC Charging Id for the
bearer and the P-GW Address.
As per TS 29.212 [213], when the Access Network Charging Identifier is not
known in the PCRF, the PCRF may request the PCEF to provide the information
associated with PCC dynamic rules. The charging identifier for each bearer
becomes known at the PCEF when the dynamic PCC rule is assigned to an existing
bearer or when the dynamic PCC rule initiates establishment of a new bearer
with a new charging identifier.
As per TS 32.260 [20], the IMS CDRs contain both the Access Correlation Id
containing the EPC charging identifier and the P-GW Address. This information
allows the billing domain to access the specific PS domain CDRs associated
with the IMS session.
NOTE 1: When Charging per IP-CAN session is active, a single PGW-CDR is
generated for the IP-CAN session accessed by the PDN Connection Charging Id
(i.e. for the default bearer). In TS 29.214 [214] and TS 29.212 [213], the PDN
Connection Charging Id is not available to the IMS domain.
As per TS 32.260 [20], the IMS information for online charging includes the
address of the P-GW and the SDP Media Component, which as per the
specification in TS 32.299 [50], includes the 3GPP-Charging-Id. This allows
the IMS nodes to provide the charging information required to access PS domain
charging information.
NOTE 2: When Charging per IP-CAN session is active, a single Gy session is
utilized for the IP-CAN session with the PDN Connection Charging Id (i.e. for
the default bearer) identified at the command level in the PS Information. In
TS 29.214 [214] and TS 29.212 [213], the PDN Connection Charging Id is not
available to the IMS domain.
### 4.5 Identifying the II-NNI traversal scenario
Dialog creating SIP request and standalone request can optionally contain an
\"iotl\" SIP URI parameter as specified in IETF draft-holmberg-dispatch-iotl
[409] and TS 24.229 [106] in a Request-URI or in a Route header field. The
\"iotl\" SIP URI parameter can be used to identify the II-NNI traversal
scenario. The \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter is appended to the URI that
represents the destination in CDRs.
One example on how the \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter is included in the Route
header field by the P-CSCF in an originating visited network when sending a
request towards the originating home network is shown below.
EXAMPLE: Route: \,\
If neither the Request-URI nor any of the Route header fields included in the
SIP request contains the \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter, the II-NNI traversal
scenario type can be determined by analysing the content of the SIP request or
using a default II-NNI traversal scenario type. The recommended II-NNI
traversal scenario type default value is \"homeA-homeB\".
NOTE: How the content of the SIP request can be used to determine the II-NNI
traversal scenario is implementation dependent and outside the scope of this
document.
The example use cases in this document assumes that the visited and home
network supports the use of the \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter and the \"iotl\"
SIP URI parameter are included in all coding examples.
The iotl values defined in IETF draft-holmberg-dispatch-iotl are:
  * \"homeA-homeB\"
  * \"homeB-visitedB\"
  * \"visitedA-homeA\"
  * \"homeA-visitedA\"
  * \"visitedA-homeB\"
### 4.6 Use of preconditions in IMS networks
An IMS UE can use preconditions based on local policy. The preconditions are
defined within IETF RFC 3312 [411]. To process the preconditions IETF RFC 3262
[410] is needed. This IETF RFC 3262 [410] is describing the reliability of
provisional responses which is needed to allow the reliable exchange of an SDP
offer and SDP answer.
All use cases in TR 29.949 [217] are assuming preconditions. The similar call
flows can appear without the preconditions mechanism.
While in the present document all use cases are showing the SDP within the 200
OK. Thus under charging consideration scenarios are not assuming the use of
preconditions while the call flows shows the possibilities where preconditions
may be used.
Since TS 24.229 [106] is stating that \"100rel\" option tag are used in
circumstances of the use of preconditions the SIP PRACK request /SIP 200 OK
response is not sent in non precondition cases. Also the UPDATE request /SIP
200 OK response is not sent since these messages are used to inform each other
about the met resource reservation.
The precondition mechanism has to be taken into consideration when collecting
the charging data relevant information since the reliable SDP answer will
appear within the SIP 200 (OK) response for the SIP UPDATE request which
indicated the fulfilment of the resource reservation.
The relevant information collected is covered with the \"List of Early SDP
Media Components\" and \"List of SDP Media Components\" as described in TS
32.260 [20]. With regard to TS 32.299 [50] the \"List of Early SDP Media
Components\" describes session, media parameters and timestamps related to
media components set to active according to SDP signalling exchanged during a
SIP session establishment and before the final successful or unsuccessful SIP
response to the initial SIP INVITE message is received. Once a media component
has been set to active, subsequent status changes shall also be registered.
The latest update of TS 24.229 allows also to activate the SDP with
precondition negotiation. i.e. attributes in SDP like \"sendonly\",
\"recvonly\" and \"sendrecv\" may be present and it is not clear if early
media is used or not. Thus an additional parameters likt the P-early-media
header fild should be taken into consideration. This issue will be discussed
in the conclusion section.
# 5 Description of Scenarios
## 5.1 Methodology for Entities description
### 5.1.1 Naming of URIs
#### 5.1.1.1 General
TS 23.003 [104] defines the principal purpose and the use of International
Mobile station Equipment Identities (IMEI) within the digital cellular
telecommunications system and the 3GPP system.
Within the TS 23.003 [104] clause 13 the numbering, addressing and
identification within the IP multimedia core network subsystem are described.
#### 5.1.1.2 Home Network Domain
The home network domain name is in the form of an internet domain name, e.g.
operator.com.
TS 23.003 [104] subclause 13.2 describes how to build the home network domain,
if there is no ISIM application.
EXAMPLE: A home network domain name is: IMSI in use with 234150999999999
results in home network domain = ims.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org.
#### 5.1.1.3 Private user identity
TS 23.003 [104] subclause 13.3 describes the principles how to build a private
user identity.
The NAI as specified in IETF RFC 4282 [405] subclause 2.1 for 3GPP systems
with ISIM application the private user identity is derived from the IMSI.
EXAMPLE: If the IMSI is 234150999999999 (MCC = 234, MNC = 15), the private
user identity then takes the form
\"234150999999999\@ims.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org\".
#### 5.1.1.4 Public user identity
TS 23.003 [104] subclause 13.4 describes the principles how to build a public
user identity.
The public user identity takes the form of either a SIP URI (see IETF RFC 3261
[404]) or a tel URI (see IETF RFC 3966 [406]).
According to TS 29.165 [216] a global number as defined in IETF RFC 3966 [406]
is used in a tel URI or in the user portion of a SIP URI with the
\"user=phone\" parameter when conveyed via a non-roaming II-NNI except when
agreement exists between the operators to also allow other kinds of numbers.
For a roaming II‑NNI no conventions are defined currently.
EXAMPLE 1: SIP URI: sip: +49892233445\@operator.com; user=phone
EXAMPLE 2: SIP URI: sip: +49892233445@ 192.0.2.4; user=phone
EXAMPLE 3: SIP URI: sip: bob\@operator.com
EXAMPLE 4: SIP: tel:+4687197378
#### 5.1.1.5 Instance-ID
TS 23.003 [104] subclause 13.8 describes the principles how to build an
instance-id.
When an IMEI is available, the instance-id takes the form of an IMEI URN. An
example of such an instance-id is as follows:
EXAMPLE 1: urn:gsma:imei:90420156-025763-0
If no IMEI is available, the instance-id takes the form of a string
representation of a UUID as a URN as defined in IETF RFC 4122 [408]. An
example of such an instance-id is as follows:
EXAMPLE 2: urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
For more information on the instance-id and when it is used, see TS 24.229
[106].

## 5.2 Registration when roaming
### 5.2.1 General
This clause describes the registration process of a roaming user including the
traversal of transit network between the visited and the originating home
network.
### 5.2.2 Registration via IC SIP proxies
The registration procedure between the visited network and the home network
uses an IC network which provides SIP proxy nodes to relay SIP traffic between
these networks.
For the registration the UE addresses an FQDN in the home network domain which
reflects the registrar (i.e. the S‑CSCF of the home network). With this FQDN
the IBCF acting as an exit point in the visited network chooses an IC provider
and routes to a SIP proxy of the selected IC provider.
The SIP layer signalling is served by the IC provider\'s SIP proxy. The SIP
proxy decides on the next SIP proxy towards the home network and routes to the
next SIP proxy or to the IBCF acting as an entry point in the home network, if
no further SIP proxy is required.
NOTE 1: The call flows just show scenarios with a single IC network and a
single SIP proxy.
The user A at UE-A is roaming into a visited network vA. The user A is a
subscriber of operator hA.
TS 32.260 [20] points out that the initial registration, user-initiated re-
registration, and user-initiated de-registration chargeable events relate to
SIP REGISTER request to trigger Charging Data Request[Event] / Debit / Reserve
Units Requests, while network-initiated deregistration event relates to SIP
NOTIFY request to trigger Charging Data Request[Event] / Debit / Reserve Units
Requests provided that subscription to registration events has been applied
(see TS 24.229 [106]).
Thus for each SIP REGISTER request/SIP 200 (OK) response cycle a event based
CDR will be written.

destination domain of this SIP REGISTER request which is the home network.
**From: Set to the SIP URI that is the default public user identity of the

option-tag \"path\".**
> **2\. SIP REGISTER request (P-CSCF-vA1 to IBCF-vA1) - see example in table
> 5.2.2.2.**
When the P-CSCF-vA1 receives the initial SIP REGISTER request the P‑CSCF-vA1
adds the P‑Visited‑Network‑ID header field containing the identifier of the
P-CSCF network. This may be the visited network domain name or any other
identifier that identifies the visited network at the home network.
The P-CSCF-vA1 needs to be in the path for all terminating requests for this
user. To ensure this, the P‑CSCF‑vA1 adds itself to the Path header field for
future requests.
The P-CSCF-vA1 selects an IBCF (IBCF-vA1) to be the IBCF acting as an exit
point towards the home network hA of the user A and sends the SIP REGISTER
request according to TS 24.229 [106] to IBCF-vA1.

**Route: P‑CSCF‑vA1 includes the selected IBCF-vA1 URI.**
**P-Access-Network-Info:** The P-CSCF-vA1 adds a network provided location,
time-zone and daylight saving time. If it does not indicate that it is a
network provided location, the P-Access-Network-Info header field containing
the location provided by the UE-A is kept in the INVITE request.
**Path:** This is the address of the P-CSCF‑vA1 and is included to inform the
S-CSCF where to route terminating requests.
**Require:** The P-CSCF-vA adds the Require header field **containing the
option-tag \"path\"** to ensure that the recipient correctly handles the Path
header field. If the recipient does not support the Path header field, a SIP
response will be received with a status code of 420 and an Unsupported header
field indicating **the option-tag** \"path\". Such a response indicates a
wrong configuration of the routing tables and the request has been routed
outside the IM CN subsystem.
**P-Visited-Network-ID:** The P-CSCF‑vA1 adds the P‑Visited‑Network‑ID header
field containing the identifier of the P-CSCF network. This may be the visited
network domain name or any other identifier that identifies the visited
network at the home network.
**P-Charging-Vector:** The P-CSCF-vA1 provides an ICID value and adds a type 1
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter with the IOI value identifying the visited
network **(i.e. \"visited‑a\")**.

route (i.e. from the P-CSCF to the S‑CSCF). This header has no influence on
the content of the CDR written.
**P-Charging-Vector:** The P-Charging-Vector header field containing the
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter, if received in the SIP REGISTER request
and a type 1 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter. The S‑CSCF‑hA1 shall set the

set to the previously received value of \"orig**‑** ioi\" header field
parameter.\ **The \"icid-value\" header field parameter is set to the
previously received value of \"icid‑value\" header field parameter in the

After the completion of the procedure, the P-CSCF and S-CSCF sends Charging
Data Request[Event] to record transaction specific information in the
P-CSCF/S-CSCF CDR.
After the registration procedure, the addresses of the P-CSCF and possibly the
S-CSCF are known in UE(A).\ Furthermore, the P-CSCF has received (and stored
internally) the following information from the UE:
\- Home Network: SIP URI of the domain name of the home network used to
address the SIP REGISTER request of the served party.
\- IMPU: To/From header field of the SIP REGISTER request.
\- User Name (optional): Authorization Header (optional) within SIP REGISTER
request (IMPI)
\- Possible the address of the S-SCSF: **S-CSCF-hA1**.home-A.net. This is
depended on the concept used within the home network domain. Either the S-CSCF
address is put into the Service-Route header sent back to the visited network.
Or the entry point of the home network which does topology hiding.
\- InstanceID containing the served IMEI which is sent back in the contact
header.
\- The Path header field will include the entities to be passed for future Re-
SIP REGISTER requests. But has no relevance for charging.
The P-CSCF has received in addition:
\- The P-Charging-Vector header field containing the \"orig-ioi\" header field
parameter, if received in the SIP REGISTER request and a type 1 \"term-ioi\"
header field parameter. The S‑CSCF‑h sets the type 1 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter to a value that identifies the sending network of the response and
the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the previously received
value of \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter which is also a Type 1 ioi.\ The
\"icid-value\" header field parameter is set to the previously received value
of \"icid‑value\" header field parameter in the request.

### 5.2.3 Subscription to the registration-state event package
#### 5.2.3.1 General
After that the registration in clause 5.2.2 is successfully completed the UE
and the P-CSCF subscribes to the registration-state event package as described
in TS 24.229 [106].
The difference between the UE-A subscription and the P-CSCF-vA1 subscription
is that the UE-A sends the SIP SUBSCRIBE request using the registration path
while the P-CSCF-vA1 is using the NNI i.e. for the IC network A it will appear
as the SIP SUBSCRIBE request sent by the P-CSCF-vA1 is between two home
networks.
NOTE: The message flows in clause 5.2.3.2 and clause 5.2.3.3 are independent
and can be done in parallel.
#### 5.2.3.2 The UE subscribes to the registration-state event package
After that the registration in clause 5.2.2 is successfully completed the UE
subscribes to the registration-state event package as described in TS 24.229
[106] clause 5.1.1.3.
Figure 5.2.3.2.1 shows how the UE-A sends the SUBSCRIBE request using the
registration path.
Figure 5.2.3.2.1: Subscription to the registration-state event package by the
UE-A
The chargeable event based information is equivalent to that as for the SIP
REGISTER request.
The chargeable event / information and charging event can be seen in table
5.2.2.4 for the P-CSCF and in table 5.2.2.5 for the S-CSCF.
#### 5.2.3.3 The P-CSCF subscribes to the registration-state event package
After that the registration in clause 5.2.2 is successfully completed the
P-CSCF-vA1 subscribes to the registration-state event package as described in
TS 24.229 [106] clause 5.2.3.
The information received in the registration-state event package can be used
by the P-CSCF to determine if a registration is still valid.
Figure 5.2.3.3.1 shows how the P-CSCF-vA1 sends the SIP SUBSCRIBE request
without using the registration path hence it will appear as the SIP SUBSCRIBE
request is sent between two home networks.

The chargeable event / information and charging event can be seen in table
5.2.3.3.1 and table 5.2.3.3.3 for the P-CSCF and in table 5.2.3.3.2 for the
S-CSCF.
## 5.3 Mobile Originating Call without loopback
This clause describes the originating call setup from a mobile subscriber who
is roaming in a foreign network, with direct media home routing, i.e. without
support of OMR (the TRF is not involved in the call flow).
The complete SIP flow is shown in TR 29.949 [217]. This clause shows the
charging relevant messages and elements.
After the registration procedure, the addresses of the P-CSCF and possibly the
S-CSCF are known in UE (A).
Figure 5.3.1: MOC Roaming Call Flow, with direct media home routing
> **1\. SIP INVITE request (UE-A to P-CSCF-vA1) - see example in table
> 5.3.1.**
The user A at UE-A initiates a call. The UE-A sends an initial SIP INVITE

When the P-CSCF-vA1 receives the initial SIP INVITE request and, since the
user A is a roaming user, based on local policy and roaming agreement the
P-CSCF‑vA1 adds the Feature-Caps header field with the \"g.3gpp.trf\" header
field parameter with the address to the TRF. The Feature --Caps header will
not needed the P-CSCF CDR
The P-CSCF-vA1 selects an IBCF (IBCF-vA1) to be the exit IBCF towards the home
IMS network hA of the user A and sends the SIP INVITE request according to TS
24.229 [106] to IBCF-v1A.
The received list of URIs in the Route header field within the SIP INVITE will
be verified with the Route header field list constructed from the Service-
Route header field received during the last registration procedure.

**SDP: C** hanges based on Feature-Caps header. No change of visited realm
since S-CSCF is not media aware.
**P-Charging-Vector:** The orig-ioi will change it from Type 1 (visited-a) to
Type 3 (home-a) and be used for the charging.
**P-Asserted-Service:** This header is the asserted version of the
P-Preferred-Service and will be included needed for S-CSCF CDR.
> **7\. SIP INVITE request (** AS-hA1 to S-CSCF-hA1**).**
The AS sends an SIP INVITE message back towards the S-CSCF. The AS decides to
suppress loopback to the VPLMN, and, hence, removes the Feature-Caps header
field +g.3gpp.home-visited.
NOTE: Of course, the AS also has multiple other options to influence the
further call handling, including a\ potential modification of the final
destination of the call. This is not considered here.

> **8\. SIP INVITE request (S-CSCF-hA1 to IBCF-hA2).**
When the S-CSCF‑hA1 receives the initial SIP INVITE request back from the
AS‑hA1 and if no further services apply then the S-CSCF‑hA1 decides according
to local policy if loopback routeing shall be used or not. In this use case
loopback will not apply. The S-CSCF‑hA1 removes the Feature-Caps header field
\"*;+g.3gpp.trf\" from the SIP INVITE request.

**29- 37. SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP INVITE request (BGCF-hA to UE-A).**
When the IBCF‑hA2 receives the SIP 200 (OK) response the IBCF‑hA2 sends the
SIP 200 (OK) response according to TS 24.229 [106] towards the UE‑A via the
S-CSCF‑hA1, AS‑hA1, IBCF‑hA1, IC‑A1, IBCF‑vA1, P-CSCF‑vA1 path as described
within TS 24.229 [106]. The SIP 200 (OK) will be routed accordingly the
content of the via header which is not relevant for charging.
Each entity will trigger the Charging Data Request[Start] and opens a CDR for
the related function.

## 5.4 Mobile Originating Call with loopback
This clause reflects the originating call setup from a mobile subscriber who
is roaming in a foreign network, with loopback, i.e. including support of
Optimized Media Routeing (OMR).
OMR can be applied by entities in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) that
control media resources and are capable of manipulating the Session
Description Protocol (SDP).
OMR procedures relates to the handling of OMR-specific SDP attributes that are
documented in TS 24.229 [106]. The OMR procedures use SDP offer/answer related
procedures in RFC 3264 [407] and in TS 24.229 [106].
More detail of OMR is given in TS 29.079 [215]. The loopback use case is shown
in TS 29.079 [215] clause A.6.
The complete SIP flow is shown in TR 29.949 [217]. This clause shows the
charging relevant messages and elements.
Figure 5.4.1: MOC Roaming Call Flow, with loopback
After the registration procedure, the addresses of the P-CSCF and possibly the
S-CSCF are known in UE (A).\ Furthermore, the P-CSCF has received see
subclause 5.3.
In case of ISIM these parameters are taken from the relevant ISIM data fields.
(see also subclause 5.1)
In case of an USIM with AKA authentication, parameters will be set as follows:
\- Home Network: (from IMSI) see subclause 5.1.1.2 e.g.
ims.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org
\- IMPU and user name (temporary IMPU from IMSI) e.g. 234150999999999@
ims.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org
The IMPU(s) provided by the UE might be temporary. During the registration
procedure, the P-CSCF will receive one or several IMPUs assigned to the served
user from the HPLMN. Just one of these IMPUs assigned by the HPLMN can be used
as P-Asserted-Identity. The IMPU from P-Asserted-Identity is used for P-CSCF
CDRs as content for the \"Calling Party Number\" field.
The S-CSCF will return all the registered IMPU\'s within the P-Associated-URI
header which are belonging to the implicit registration set. The implicit
registration is set in the HSS configuration option where one or more IMPU\'s
can be bind together. i.e. on UA is reachable under different IMPUS.
In detail, the messages in the call flow depicted in Figure 5.1.1-1 contain
the following information:
> **1\. SIP INVITE request (UE-A to P-CSCF-vA1).**
>
> The session is initiated by sending a SIP:INVITE from UE A to the P-CSCF:\

> **9.-10. SIP INVITE request (IBCF-hA1 to IBCF-vA1).**
The SIP INVITE is sent via Ibcf-hA1.home-A.net and the VoIP IC network to the
Ibcf-vA1.visited-A.net of the VPLMN.
> When the IBCF-hA1 receives the initial SIP INVITE request containing the
> \"+g.3gpp.loopback\" header field parameter in a Feature-Caps header field,

NOTE: The transit network in the loopback leg may be different compared to the
leg between VPLMN to HPLMN. This has no impact on the roaming itself since the
bilateral agreement has to reflect such possibilities. Technically neither
functional nor charging aspect differences are seen.

> **12.-13 SIP INVITE request (TRF-vA1 to IC-B1)**
The TRF detects that this is a \"loopback\" request from a roaming subscriber.
It decides on the routing towards the final destination of the call and
forwards the SIP INVITE to an appropriate network node.\ In the figure it is
assumed, that the destination is an IP connection outside the VPLMN, but other
options (CS connection, destination inside VPLMN) are also possible.
> When the TRF‑vA1 receives the initial SIP INVITE request the TRF‑vA1:
\- performs number normalization (if used by local policy) and ENUM
translation and possibly and updates the request-URI if necessary;
\- replaces an type 1 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter value in the
P-Charging-Vector header field with a type 2 \"orig‑ioi\" header field
parameter value where the IOI value identifies the visited network;
\- possibly adds an additional Route header field pointing to the IBCF‑vA1 and
also to the IC in cases where the IBCF-vA1 has no routeing decision to do;
\- removes the \"+g.3gpp.loopback\" header field parameter from the Feature-
Caps header field of the outgoing request; and
\- appends the \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter with the value \"visitedA-homeB\" to
the Request-URI.

## 5.5 Routeing when the originating and terminating user reside in the same
home network
This clause describes routeing when the originating and terminating user
reside in the same home network.
This use case is a normal VoLTE IMS call without roaming. The originating and
terminating user are directly attached to the same home network. Thus a
consideration of roaming relevant charging issues is not needed.
## 5.6 Routeing from originating home to terminating home network
This clause describes routeing from the originating home network to the
terminating home network including transit network scenarios.
This use case is a normal IMS call between two home networks. The IC and
routing aspects of this use case do not differ from any other session set-up
between any two wire-line or mobile networks. The IC might be established via
CS-IC or PS-IC. Routing will be based on the destination given by the request
line (Called Party Number in case of CS-IC).
If originating and/or terminating user are directly or via roaming attached to
their home network does not change this scenario. There is no specific
signalling or roaming specific charging needed. It is a normal interconnection
between two networks. Thus a consideration of roaming relevant charging issues
is not needed.
## 5.7 Routeing from originating visited network to terminating home network
This clause describes routeing from the originating visited network to the
terminating home network including transit network scenarios.
The complete description of the scenario is shown in TR 29.949 [217] clause
5.7.
The scenario appears after the \"originating roaming without loopback\"
according to clause 5.3 or \"originating roaming with loopback\" according to
clause 5.4 has taken place. I.e. the call has already been set-up from the
P-CSCF in the originating visited network via IMS in the originating home
network back to the TRF in the originating visited network. This use case is
like a normal IMS call between two IMS networks from an IBCF acting as exit
point and an IBCF acting as entry point.
There is no specific signalling or roaming specific charging needed. It is a
normal interconnection between two networks. Thus a consideration of roaming
relevant charging issues is not needed.
## 5.8 Routeing in terminating home network when user resides in this network
This use case does not involve any interconnection network and is out of scope
of the present document.
## 5.9 Routeing from terminating home network to the terminating visited
network
This subclause describes routeing from the terminating home network to the
terminating visited network including the traversal of transit network between
the terminating home network and the terminating visited network.
Preconditions:
\- The UE-A is registered as described in subclause 5.2.
\- In the originating side the call can be routed either as a call without
loopback as described in subclause 5.3 or with loopback as described in
subclause 5.4.
\- The coding examples assume that the originating network, the
interconnection network and the terminating network are within the trust
domain.

\- **SIP 183 (Session Progress) response (S-CSCF-hA1 to IBCF-hA2):** The
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter includes a type 2 IOI value which
identifies the home network hA. The \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter is
not appearing. The S-CSCF removes received \"transit**‑** ioi\" values, the
IOI Type 1 or Type 3 in \"orig-ioi\" and \"term-ioi\" header field parameters.
The \"orig**‑** ioi\" header field parameter is set to the same type 2 IOI
value that was included in the initial SIP INVITE request from the remote home
network or, in case of loopback, from the remote visited network. The \"term-

The SIP PRACK request and the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP PRACK request
are sent without any SDP offer/SDP answer between the **IBCF-** hA2 **and the
UE‑** A according to TS 24.229 [4]. The messages are sent via all intermediate

**20\. UPDATE requests (IBCF-hA2 to UE-A via all intermediate nodes) and SIP
200 (OK) response to the SIP UPDATE request (UE-A to IBCF-hA2 via all
intermediate nodes).**
When resources are reserved in the access network of the remote UE, the
IBCF‑hA2 receives an UPDATE request from the remote network. The IBCF-hA2
forwards the request towards the UE-A. The messages are sent via all
intermediate nodes with the exception of I-CSCF-hA1.

via all intermediate nodes).**
NOTE 3: If the interconnection network is SIP-unaware, step 24 is skipped. The
messages are sent via all intermediate nodes including the I-CSCF-hA1.
**30\. SIP PRACK request s (IBCF‑hA2 to UE‑A via all intermediate nodes) and
SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP PRACK request (UE-A to IBCF-hA2 via all

The SIP PRACK request and the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP PRACK request
are sent without any SDP offer/SDP answer between the UE-A and the IBCF-hA2
according to TS 24.229 [4]. The messages are sent via all intermediate nodes
with the exception of I-CSCF-hA1.

## 5.10 Insertion of service related media in the originating home network
5.10.1 General
This clause describes insertion of a service related media in the originating
home network (i.e. invocation of MRFC/MRF).
TS 24.628 [218] describes how to include announcements into the path for IMS.
There are a couple of options which have to be considered for roaming.
The following clauses are showing some examples where service related media
can be included. The examples will not cover all possible scenarios defined
within 3GPP.
5.10.2 Insertion of service related media in the originating home network with
loopback
{width="6.6875in" height="7.756944444444445in"}
Figure 5.10.2.1: Announcement started during the establishment of a
communication
The calling party initiates a communication by means of an SIP INVITE request.
The SIP INVITE request is forwarded toward the called party.
Along the signalling path, created by the SIP INVITE request, some service
logic in an AS wants to send an announcement towards the calling party.
The flow is based on the assumptions that the Supported header field includes
the option‑tag \"100rel\".
For this case the information of loopback is very important to have a clear
statement that announcement was played by home network A and the media
interaction between UE-A and UE-B applies directly without involvement of home
network A.
The steps of the signalling flow are as follows:
**1.-5. SIP INVITE request (UE‑A to S-CSCF-hA1 via P-CSCF-vA1, IBCF-vA1, IC-A1
and IBCF-hA1)**
> The SIP INVITE request is sent as described within clause 5.3.
NOTE 1: If the interconnection network is SIP-unaware, step 4 is skipped.
> For the consideration of Chargeable Event / Information for the INVITE
> request for the mapping to the Information Elements at the P-CSCF-vA1 table
> 5.3.2, at the IBCF-vA1 table 5.3.4, TF table 5.3.6, at the IBCF-hA1 table
> 5.3.8 and at the S-CSCF-hA1 table 5.3.10 apply.
>
> For the consideration of Chargeable Event / Information for the SDP portion
> of the SIP INVITE request for the mapping to the Information Elements at the
> P-CSCF-vA1 table 5.2.3, at the IBCF-vA1 table 5.3.5, at the TF table 5.3.7,
> at the IBCF-hA1 table 5.3.9 and at the S-CSCF-hA1 table 5.3.11 apply
**6\. Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
> The S-CSCF-hA1 validates the service profile of this subscriber and
> evaluates the initial filter criteria. For this example, assume an AS/MRFC
> involvement.
**7\. SIP INVITE request (S-CSCF-hA1 to AS‑hA1 /MRFC)**
> The S-CSCF-hA1 applies the same procedure as in step 6 in clause 5.3.
>
> With regard to charging in addition the AS-Information about the use of the
> AS will be stored.
>
> There is no indication that the service will include an announcement. Only
> if it is a specific AS hosting announcement services like customized
> ringback tones.
>
> For the consideration of Chargeable Event / Information for the INVITE
> request at the AS-hA1 table 5.3.7 SIP INVITE request Header Field to
> Information Element apply.
>
> **8\. Service logic in AS‑hA1 /MRFC**
>
> Service logic in the AS‑hA1 decides to send an announcement to the calling
> party. In such a case the AS‑hA1 acts as a B2BUA. Thus an early dialog for
> the announcement and two dialogs will be created in the final call state one
> from UE-A to the AS‑hA1 and one from the AS‑hA1 to the terminating UE which
> allows end-to-end communication.
>
> **9\. MRFC-MRFP interaction**
>
> The MRFC interacts with the MRFP in order to reserve resources for the
> announcement. As part of the interaction with MRFP the AS‑hA1 receives the
> necessary media parameters e.g. IP address and port numbers and provide the
> IP address and port number for the calling party to the MRFP.
>
> **10.-15. SIP 183 (Session Progress) response (AS‑hA1 to UE‑A via S-CSCF-
> hA1, IBCF-hA1, IC-A1, IBCF-vA1 and P-CSCF-vA1)**
>
> The AS‑hA1 sends a SIP 183 (Session progress) response to S-CSCF‑hA1. The
> response includes:
a) an answer to the SDP received in the SIP INVITE request;
b) a P-Early-Media header field set to \"sendonly\" in case where only
announcement will be played. For invoking an interactive voice response system
a P-Early-Media header field is set to \"sendrecv\"; and
c) the Require header field set to \"100rel\".
> In this case the information within the SDP will have relevance for the
> information element Early Media Description and SDP session description. The
> IE will be finally filled when the SIP PRACK request/SIP 200 OK response
> cycle made the SIP 183response reliable.

Since there is no change of SDP the IE Early Media Description nor IE: SDP
Media Component will be changed. Thus seen from time stamp the early media
will still continue till an other codec negotiation will take place.
The specifications TS 32.260 [20] nor TS 32.298 [51] does not describe how to

## 5.11 PS to CS SRVCC access transfer scenarios
### 5.11.1 General
This clause describes PS to CS SRVCC access transfer scenarios including the
registration and the additional message flow due to PS to CS SRVCC.
For IMS roaming PS to CS SRVCC procedure with media anchoring in the ATGW of
the visited network and signalling anchored in the SCC AS of the home network
is used.
In case of PS to CS SRVCC the media path between the visited network and the
home network needs to be re-established since the SIP dialogue between the
ATCF in the visited network and the SCC AS in the home network is re-
established.
From viewpoint of the remote side the signalling anchors do not change due to
the PS to CS SRVCC. However, the media anchors changes due to the PS to CS
SRVCC in case of \"originating roaming to home network without loopback\" (see
clause 5.3) since the CS target access leg is created using a new IBCF.
Seen from charging point of view there will be no new information published to
the billing domain which needs to be considered in addition to identify the
roaming REVOLTE use case. The ATCF is a new network element within the path
which creates its own events and will be considered for CDR creation and
correlation within the billing domain. Thus the following call flows are shown
for completion.
### 5.11.2 PS to CS SRVCC information transfer during registration
This clause describes the PS to CS SRVCC access transfer specifics during
registration.
Preconditions to this flow are:
\- the conditions in clause 5.2.2 are fulfilled; and
\- both the visited network support PS to CS access transfer and MSC servers
in the network are enhanced to use SIP signalling towards the IMS.
As stated in clause 5.2.2 TS 32.260 [20] points out that the initial
registration, user-initiated re-registration, and user-initiated de-
registration chargeable events relate to SIP REGISTER request to trigger
Charging Data Request[Event] / Debit / Reserve Units Requests.
A SIP 200 OK response to a SIP MESSAGE request triggers also a Charging Data
Request [Event].
Figure 5.11.2.1 shows the message flow when a UE registers in IMS over PS
before SRVCC occurs as described in clause 5.11.3.
Figure 5.11.2.1: SRVCC information transfer during registration
The steps of the flow are as follows:
**1\. The UE-A registers in IMS and receives a 401 (Unauthorized) response.**
> The flow is the same as in clause 5.2.2 with the exception that the ATCF is
> included in the registration path.
**2.-3. SIP REGISTER request (UE-A to ATCF-vA1)**
> The UE-A sends a SIP REGISTER request again (now with an authentication
> challenge response included) and forwards it to the P-CSCF-vA1. The P-CSCF-
> vA1 forwards the SIP REGISTER request to an ATCF‑vA1 according to local
> policy. The content of the SIP REGISTER request is not different from the
> content of the SIP REGISTER request in clause 5.2.2.
>
> No different aspect due to charging appear.
**4\. SIP REGISTER request (ATCF-vA1 to IBCF-vA1) - see example in table
5.11.2.1.**
> When the ATCF-vA1 receives the SIP REGISTER request, the ATCF-vA1 updates
> its database for registrations and selects an IBCF according to local policy
> for routeing the SIP REGISTER request towards the home network.

### 5.11.3 PS to CS SRVCC access transfer for a call in the active phase
without loopback
This clause describes the PS to CS SRVCC access transfer of a call in the
active phase.
Preconditions to this call flow:
1\. a call is established between a UE-A and a remote UE as described in
clause 5.3. The UE-A is attached to a 4G radio access network (E-UTRAN);
2\. media is anchored in:
a. the P-CSCF-vA1, the ATCF-vA1 and IBCF-vA1 in the visited network vA;
b. the IC-A1 in the IC network A; and
c. the IBCF-hA1 and the IBCF-hA2 in the home network hA; and
3\. SIP signalling is anchored in SCC AS-hA1.
NOTE 1: The signalling flow is the same for PS to CS SRVCC access transfer for
a call in the active phase regardless if the UE-A or the remote UE initiated
the call.
Figure 5.11.3.1 shows the SIP message flow when PS to CS SRVCC access transfer
of a call in the active phase occurs.
NOTE: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) messages are not shown in the
signalling flow.
Figure 5.11.3.1: SRVCC without loop back message flow
NOTE 2: If the interconnection network is SIP-unaware, or if IC-A1 is only a
SIP proxy rather than a SIP-ALG with attached SIP-AGW, IC-A1 is not in the
media path.
The steps of the flow are as follows:
**1\. A call is established as described in clause 5.3 between UE-A and a
remote UE.**
\- The remote UE can be a UE connected to IMS or an UE connected to CS and the
difference compared to the description in clause 5.3 and this PS to CS SRVCC
access transfer scenario is that an ATCF in the visited originated network
participated in the call establishment of the call and that the general AS-hA1
in figure 5.3.2.1 is replaced by the access transfer specific AS i.e. the SCC
AS-hA1.
\- The media path is UE-A -- P-CSCF-vA1 -- ATCF-vA1 -- IBCF-vA1 -- IC-A1 \--
IBCF-hA1 -- IBCF-hA2 -- remote network -- remote UE.
**2\. SRVCC handover occurs.**
> During the ongoing call the UE-A is performing measurements on signalling
> strength in neighbouring cells and sends continuously the measurement
> results to the core network. Due to decreasing signalling strength in the 4G
> radio access network the core network takes a decision that the UE shall be
> handed over to a 3G radio access network and sends a PS to CS SRVCC request
> to the MSC server-vA1.
**3\. SIP INVITE request due to STN-SR (MSC server-vA1 via P-CSCF-vA1 to ATCF-
vA1) - see example in table 5.11.3.3.**
\- When the MSC server-vA1 receives the PS to CS SRVCC request from the core
network in the visited network, the MSC server-vA1 sends an SIP INVITE request
to the ATCF-vA1. This SIP INVITE request is referred to as an \"SIP INVITE
request due to STN-SR\" in the TS 24.237 [218].
**4\. SIP 200 (OK) response (ATCF-vA1 to MSC server-vA1) -- see example in
table 5.11.3.4.**
> When the ATCF-vA1 receives the SIP INVITE request due to STN-SR the ATCF-vA1
> checks if there is a session that fulfils conditions for being transferred
> and detects that there is a call in an active phase ongoing between UE-A and
> a remote UE. To avoid speech gaps, the ATCF-vA1 returns a SIP 200 (OK)
> response towards the MSC server‑vA1 containing media parameters retrieved
> from the ATGW.
>
> The ATCF-vA1 also adds the \"related-icid\" header field parameter
> containing the \"icid-value\" header fields parameter used in the original
> call and can be used for charging correlation of generated CDR records in
> the visited network A **(i.e. \"visited‑a\")**.

NOTE 5: The IC-A1 can add a Route header field entry pointing to the entry
point of home network hA. However, since this is not necessary for routeing
the call it is not shown in table 5.11.3.8.
Only Via and Record-Route header filed will be manipulated. This has no
charging relevant influence.
**9\. SIP INVITE request due to ATU-STI (IBCF-hA1 to SCC AS-hA1 via I-CSCF) -
see example in table 5.11.3.9.**

>
> **P-Charging-Vector:** The IBCF-hA1 includes the \"transit-ioi\" header

Only Via and Record-Route header filed will be manipulated. This has no
charging relevant influence.
**10\. SIP INVITE request (SCC AS-hA1 to S-CSCF-hA1) - see example in table
5.11.3.10.**
> When the SCC AS-hA1 receives the SIP INVITE request due to ATU-STI the SCC
> AS-hA1 compares the received SDP with the SDP negotiated in the existing
> session. The conclusion is that it differs so the SCC AS-hA1 needs to send a
> re-SIP INVITE request towards the remote UE.
NOTE 6: The AS can either remove the OMR attributes in the SDP or keep them
depending on if the AS supports OMR and local policy. In this example the OMR
attributes are removed.
NOTE 7: When a user is roaming and media is anchored in IBCF the IP addresses
will be different in the SDP received in the SIP INVITE request due to ATU-STI
compared to those negotiated in the existing session towards the remote UE and
that will always result in that a re-SIP INVITE request is needed towards the
remote UE.

### 5.11.4 PS to CS SRVCC access transfer for a call in the active phase with
loopback
This clause describes the PS to CS SRVCC access transfer of a call in the
active phase with loopback.
Preconditions to this call flow:
1\. A call is established between a UE-A and a remote UE as described in
clause 5.4. The UE-A is attached to a 4G radio access network (E-UTRAN);
NOTE 1: The signalling flow is the same for PS to CS SRVCC access transfer for
a call in the active phase regardless if the UE-A or the remote UE initiated
the call.
2\. The media is anchored in the P-CSCF-vA1, ATCF-vA1 and IBCF‑vA1 in the
visited network vA); and
3\. SIP signalling is anchored in SCC AS‑hA1.
Figure 5.11.4.1 shows the SIP message flow when PS to CS SRVCC access transfer
of a call in the active phase occurs.
NOTE: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) messages are not shown in the
signalling flow.

## 5.12 Invocation and configuration of services during roaming in a visited
network
This case describes how the user within a visited network invokes services via
the Ut interface.
GSMA IR.88 [603] describes that the home operator must provide an APN to be
used by the UE for XCAP/Ut. For the UE details see GSMA IR.92 [604].
The \"well-known\" IMS APN must not be used as APN for XCAP/Ut as defined in
of IR.88 [603] clause 6.3.2.
In addition GSMA IR.92 [604] describes that for XCAP requests, the UE must be
preconfigured or provisioned by the home operator with the APN to be used for
XCAP requests.
Since this connection is a direct connection between the UE and the related AS
to configure services by the user it is not seen any interactivity for
charging relevant issues as described within the VoLTE Charging framework.
(i.e. TS 32.260 [20]).
The connection is done via http and is only relevant for data volume used for
IP connectivity.

## 6.1 Key Issue #1: Unnecessary correlation of CDRs when loopback is not
active
### 6.1.1 Description
Clause 4.2 describes a principle that an operator shall be able to use
information given within CDR to calculate the accounting fees between HPLMN
and VPLMN.
The P‑CSCF CDR is the primary source of information for the VPLMN to charge
the HPLMN for roaming users. In the VPLMN, when loopback is enabled for a
session, then additional information from the TRF CDR generated for the
session is relevant for such a calculation. Such information is also usable
for IBCF CDR correlation.
In cases where loopback applies for a roaming call, the originating P‑CSCF
does not get the information if loopback applies. When processing the P‑CSCF
CDR, the operator must attempt to locate a correlated TRF CDR even for the
non-loopback scenario when no CDR exists.
With regard to operation principles, it is seen that a big effort is needed to
correlate the CDRs given by the P-CSCF, IBCF and TRF within the visited
network to generate the TAP record incurring significant processing load in
the billing system.
In SRVCC use cases such information would be valuable for the ATCF too.
### 6.1.2 Assumptions
The S-CSCF receives a feature caps indicator (\"+g.3gpp.loopback\") in the
backward direction to indicate that loopback applies for an IMS session.
Within the S-CSCF this indication is deleted and not forwarded to the P-CSCF
within the visited network. Thus, the P-CSCF is not aware that loopback has
occurred.
### 6.1.3 Current Status
In cases when loopback applies for a roaming call, the originating P-CSCF does
not get the information that loopback has been applied leading to significant
unnecessary correlation activity in the billing domain.
### 6.1.4 Alternative Options
#### 6.1.4.1 Alternative 1 -- Loopback indication
To remove the need to attempt to locate TRF CDRs for IMS sessions for which no
loopback has occurred, this alternative proposes that an indication be
delivered via SIP to the P‑CSCF and ATCF for recording in the CDR. This
indication will let the operator know when to expect a corresponding TRF CDR
for this IMS session allowing for efficient processing in the billing system.
An example of such an indication is the feature caps indicator
(\"+g.3gpp.loopback\") that the S-CSCF receives in the backward direction to
indicate that loopback applies for the IMS session. If this indication is
delivered to the P-CSCF and recorded in the CDR, then, the operator billing
system will be aware of when there is a need to perform correlation with a TRF
CDR.
With regard to the information the NNI Information contains that loopback has
been applied. The IE NNI Information/IE NNI Type is sent by the CTF but
included neither within the P-CSCF CDR nor within the ATCF CDR.
### 6.1.5 Evaluation and Recommendation
It is recommended to include the NNI Information information within the P-CSCF
and ATCF CDR.
CT1 should be involved (Liaison) within the work for this solution. Important
for such solution is a indication that loopback is applied is received by the
VPLMN.
## 6.2 Key Issue #2: Identification of home network
### 6.2.1 Description
One of the charging principles in clause 4.2 is that the roaming subscriber
only has a contract with his home network operator (HPLMN).
TD.57 sets this as a mandatory element.
Table 6.2.1.1: TD.57 Excerpt
+-------------+-------------+----+---------+--------+-------------+ | **Charged | Information | 30 | Content | Severe | Mandatory | | Party Home | identifying | | | | item Home | | Ident | the home | 31 | Content | Severe | Id Type | | ification** | environment | | | | missing | | | of the | | | | within | | | Charged | | | | group. | | | Party. | | | | | | | | | | | Mandatory | | | The group | | | | item Home | | | when | | | | Identifier | | | present | | | | missing | | | must | | | | within | | | contain | | | | group. | | | items Home | | | | | | | Id Type and | | | | | | | Home | | | | | | | Identifier. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | This | | | | | | | information | | | | | | | is not | | | | | | | required | | | | | | | when the | | | | | | | Home and | | | | | | | Recipient | | | | | | | are the | | | | | | | same | | | | | | | entity. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | _Condi | | | | | | | tionality:_ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | One or more | | | | | | | occurrences | | | | | | | may be | | | | | | | present | | | | | | | within | | | | | | | group | | | | | | | Charged | | | | | | | Party | | | | | | | Information | | | | | | | where | | | | | | | available. | | | | | +-------------+-------------+----+---------+--------+-------------+
The home network name is required to identify the HPLMN to which the TAP CDR
will be sent.
To identify the \"charging distance\" for direct media home routing (i.e.
without loopback) the home network information is needed. This is reflected in
the charging principles in clause 4.2; \"zonal charging\" shall be supported.
### 6.2.2 Assumptions
Within the Call Scenarios given in Subclauses 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 for Mobile
originating call with and without loopback the home network operator is known
by the inclusion of the Route header field. The last element includes the
information about the home network. Thus the P-CSCF and the IBCF of the
visited network have the information now.
Since this information directly relates to the routing of the call, it can be
used for \"zonal charging\".
The TRF will get the Information within the INVITE which includes the feature
caps header in the format Feature-Caps:*;+g.3gpp.loopback=\"homenetwork_A\".
For terminating calls as described in clause 5.1.3, the IOI information
related to the home network within the INVITE may not be sufficient.
### 6.2.3 Current Status
With regard to TS 32.260 [20], the Home network is not an existing field while
the Route header is included within the CDR of the P-CSCF.
The P-CSCF includes the information identified in table 6.2.3.1.
Table 6.2.3.1: Charging Data of P-CSCF CDR
* * *
Field Category Description SIP Route header received O~C~ Contains the
information in the topmost route header in a received initial SIP INVITE or
non-session related SIP MESSAGE request. This field is used for SIP requests
toward the served user. SIP Route header transmitted O~C~ Contains the
information in the route header representing the destination in a transmitted
initial SIP INVITE or non-session related SIP MESSAGE request. This field is
used for SIP requests from the served user.
* * *
The SIP Route header received is only for terminating calls and will not have
any information of the home network
The SIP Route header transmitted will have the home network information within
the last entry.
The IBCF includes the information identified in table 6.2.3.2.
Table 6.2.3.2: Charging Data of IBCF CDR
* * *
Field Category Description SIP Route header received in an INVITE request O~C~
Contains the information in the topmost route header in a received initial SIP
INVITE and non-session related SIP MESSAGE request.
* * *
The SIP Route header received in an INVITE request contains the information in
the topmost route header of the received INVITE i.e. the IBCF address itself.
More information is not given within the CDR. In addition seen from the call
scenario it is also not clear what role the IBCF has in such a call either
entry or exit point.
Table 6.2.3.3: Charging Data of TRF CDR
* * *
Field Category Description SIP Route header received O~C~ Contains the
information in the topmost route header in a received initial SIP INVITE or
non-session related SIP MESSAGE request.
* * *
The SIP Route header received in an INVITE request contains the information in
the topmost route header of the received INVITE i.e. the TRF address itself
Looking on the data collected by the P-CSCF, IBCF and TRF only the P-CSCF
within the originating visited network will have the information of the home
network. The IBCF and TRF CDRs do not include the home network information.
### 6.2.4 Alternative Options
#### 6.2.4.1 Alternative 1 -- Home Network Information from Registration
Procedure
During the registration procedure, the P-CSCF stores the Service-Route header
fields (TS 24.229 [106], clause 5.2.2.1) and keeps them during the entire
registration period. The Service-Route header points to the S-CSCF which is
always located in the home network. Hence, information on the home network is
always available in a P-CSCF serving an inbound roamer and can easily be
included in the P-CSCF CDR, independent of call scenario (MOC and MTC), and
independent of the routing scenario (with or without loopback).
#### 6.2.4.2 Alternative 2 -- IOI sent in SIP INVITE Request and SIP 200 (OK)
response
The SIP INVITE request sent form the terminating home network towards the
terminating visited network will contain a Type 1 Orig-IOI set to the
terminating home network. This value can be taken by the P-CSCF to identify
the home network.
Each INVITE will be finally answered with SIP 200 (OK) response sent by the
UAS. The originating S-CSCF includes a Type 1 Term-IOI into the P-Charging-
Vector header field. This is received by the originating P-CSCF.
This information is only available when the P-Charging --Vector header field
is passed towards the originating visited network. In cases where calls will
be passed through a transit network which may not be trusted the P-Charging-
vector header field may be deleted.
#### 6.2.4.2 Alternative 3 -- Use of other SIP header fields
The use of other SIP header fields where the home network may be included
seems not to be workable.
The headers taken into consideration are the Via header field, the Route
header field and the Record-Route header field.
The SIP Via header field will contain all SIP entities passed in forward
direction. This header will be collected within the initial SIP request and
copied into the SIP response. This is needed that the response will pass all
elements needed.
The home network will be traced in form of the S-CSCF address. But the
mechanism will possibly not work when a B2BUA is in between the visited and
home network. If this B2BUA has a THIG functionality the B2BUA (e.G IBCF) will
store the received Via header field and send a new via header field with one
entry.
Record-Route header field will normally also not pass B2BUA (i.e. IBCF) thus
the same apply as for the via header field. The Record-Route header may be
used only for terminating calls where the S-CSCF or other anchor entity for
the home network is included. For originating calls the Route header field may
be used to identify the home network. Thus the last entity included will be
the home network.
Additionally the entries within the Sip header fields Via, Route and Record-
Rout includes physical entities which may not apply to the home network. This
would happen when an operator is reselling capacity to a service provider
selling its own brand for mobile communication.
### 6.2.5 Evaluation and Recommendation
Seen form availability both information will be available in normal call
scenarios. In cases when passing non trusted networks the P-Charging vector
header may be deleted. Such case can happen but assuming the ideal use case,
i.e. the operator is interconnecting only with trusted operators; the use of
IOI\'s should be secure.
The question operators have to ask is, if it can be guaranteed that the
P-Charging--Vector header will not be manipulated by transit networks. If not
the IOI value cannot be considered. But following this approach the question
is if the other information exchanged is also trustworthy, i.e. registration
information.
Thus both Alternatives will work in normal use cases.
To have a 100% secure solution a proposal for solution would be that the
Type_1 Term-IOI should be compared with the home network ID stored by the
P-CSCF. If the Term-IOI is not available or has another value than the stored
home network ID then the stored home network-id shall have precedence. For the
terminating case the same ruling with the Orig-IOI sent within the SIP INVITE
apply.
A recommendation is that TS 32.260 should improve the description of the use
of IOI values to identify the home network of the UE and additionally the
comparison procedure should be taken into consideration for a 100% proof
identification of the home network.
## 6.3 Key Issue #3: Media Plane Interconnection is not reflected in any CDR
### 6.3.1 Description
One IBCF (signalling plane interconnection) may control multiple TrGWs (media
plane interconnection). TrGWs controlled by one IBCF may be spatially
separated by long distances, and (in case of a multinational operator, i.e. a
company controlling multiple mobile networks in different countries) they may
even be located in different PLMNs.\ In this case, the address of the TrGW may
be more relevant for charging / accounting than the address of the IBCF.
Furthermore, a network node (e.g. an IBCF or a TrGW) may use multiple \"own\"
IP addresses to distinguish between different connections to neighbour nodes
(e.g. IP address \"A1\" for connections to operator B1, and IP address \"A2\"
for connections to operator B2). However, currently only one (own / IBCF)
\"Node Address\" and one \"Neighbour Node Address\" are included in the IBCF
CDR
An example is depicted in figure 6.3.1.1: a connection is set up from operator
A to a destination belonging to operator B. Operator B controls two networks
(PLMN B1 and PLMN B2) (e.g.) in two different countries. However, it uses only
one IBCF located in PLMN B1, whereas the destination of the call is located in
PLMN B2.
The outgoing TrGW (A) of operator A uses two different \"own\" IP addresses
for connections towards the different TrGWs: IP address A1 for connections
towards TrGW (B1) and IP address A2 for connections towards TrGW (B2). The
signalling plane connection is established between IBCF (A) and IBCF (B),
where IBCF (B) happens to be in PLMN B1. Since the destination is located in
PLMN B2, the media plane connection is established from TrGW (A) using IP
address A2 towards TrGW (B2) (thick red line). TrGW (A) would also support a
connection towards TrGW (B1) (grey dotted line; using IP address A1), but this
is not established here, because the destination is located in PLMN B2.
Figure 6.3.1.1: Example: Usage of LinkID
### 6.3.2 Assumptions
The field NNI Information only contains information on network nodes for the
signalling plane (IBCF addresses). However, for voice (or video) connections,
the media plane is relevant for charging / accounting. Hence, information
about the interconnection nodes of the media plane (e.g. TrGWs) should also be
included in the IBCF CDR.
A conversation table within an IMS network element must be built to correlate
the source and destination IP addresses with a specific LinkID this has to be
done within each IMS element. Problematic is that each IMS element will have
their own LinkID\'s because a correlation between the IMS element would need
more protocol and procedural work to be done. Or it has to be done via
configuration which needs even more effort.
Thus building a LinkID needs an automatic naming mechanism extracted of
available data within the node. I.e. using the transport IP addresses would be
the easiest approach but will not solve to bundle the different TrGW used by
the originating or terminating operator for a interconnection relation.
### 6.3.3 Current Status
Currently, the used connection between the two networks for the media plane is
not at all reflected in the IBCF CDR. Since the media plane is usually to be
charged, correct interconnection charging is not possible.
### 6.3.4 Alternative Options
#### 6.3.4.1 Alternative 1 -- LinkID
The introduction of a new field \"LinkID\" into the field NNI Information in
IBCF CDR is possible. This field is introduced as an equivalent to the
\"TrunkID\" that is currently used in CS networks. It shall contain a
(logical, operator specific) logical ID.
The LinkID shall unambiguously identify the IP connection towards the
neighbour TrGW node, which is used for the media plane of the current call.
(In the example figure: the \"red arrow\", identified by the IP address (and
port) A2 used at TrGW(A), and the IP address (and port) of TrGW(B2).)
An IBCF needs related tables which have to be configured to identify the
needed IP Address relations for one LinkID. Another aspect is that the IP
addresses of the destination may vary depended on the SDP answer coming from
the interconnection partner. To fix such aspects more bilateral negotiation is
needed and even that will not guarantee every time a correct interconnection
relation.
#### 6.3.4.2 Alternative 2 -- Connection Data within SDP
As an alternative to a \"logical\" ID, the pair of both IP address (and ports)
of both TrGWs used in the interconnection scenario may be included, however an
abstract \"logical\" ID to be sufficient and easier to implement. A logical ID
would also decouple the CDR post processing in IT billing systems from the
actual technical network IP configuration.
The information is given within the SDP lines:
o= (originator and session identifier)
> This address line contains the is the address of the machine from which the
> session was created. Thus this address is the UAC (i.e. UE or B2BUA)
> creating the session.
c=* (connection information -- not required if included in all media)
This line contains the IP address of the expected data source or data relay or
data sink as determined by additional attribute fields.
m= (media name and transport address)
This line contains the transport port to which the media stream shall be sent.
These Data will be sent within the offer which is normally contained within
the SIP INVITE request and the answer which is normally within one of the
received provisional or final responses.
The \"c\" line is within the SDP Media Description AVP and the \"m\" line is
within the SDP Media Name AVP included.
These AVP\'s will appear several times since within the offer and answer the
related IP addresses are different. Thus originating and designating IP
address will appear in different AVP\'s.
The information of the interconnection partner is given within the ioi values
and can be processed within the billing domain
### 6.1.5 Evaluation and Recommendation
Both possibilities are working. Alternative 1 has the advantage that the
LinkID is one identifier that allows an easy identification of the RTP
relation within the billing domain. But processing in the P-CSCF needs
additional effort for signaling procedures and configuration of data by the
operator.
The extraction of both IP addresses out of the \"c\" line and possibly the
\"m\" line as described in Alternative 2 in the billing domain is more complex
but no changes within the P-CSCF are needed. Also configuration of LinkID\'s
within the billing domain would be easier since it is centralized.
Alternative 2 is seen as the preferred solution since the billing domain can
needs only one centralized information about the interconnection relationship.
Thus such a linked can be built easy within the billing domain.
For specification within 3GPP no additional work needs to be done since the
functionality of the billing domain is negotiated between operator and vendor.
Thus if a LinkID is needed for billing purposes this needs to be indicated by
the operator to the vendor of the billing domain.
## 6.4 Other topics to be considered and recommendations
### 6.4.1 List of Early Media
The relevant information collected is covered with the \"List of Early SDP
Media Components\" and \"List of SDP Media Components\" as described in TS
32.260 [20]. With regard to TS 32.299 [50] the \"List of Early SDP Media
Components\" describes session, media parameters and timestamps related to
media components set to active according to SDP signalling exchanged during a
SIP session establishment and before the final successful or unsuccessful SIP
response to the initial SIP INVITE message is received. Once a media component
has been set to active, subsequent status changes shall also be registered.
The latest update of TS 24.229 [109] allows also to activate the SDP with
precondition negotiation. i.e. attributes in SDP like \"sendonly\",
\"recvonly\" and \"sendrecv\" may be present and it is not clear if early
media is used or not. Thus an additional parameters like the P-Early-Media
header field should be taken into consideration.
Thus a documentation extension with additional procedures within the TS 32.260
[20] and TS 32.229 [50] is recommended.
### 6.4.2 Inter Operator Traffic Leg parameter (iotl)
TS 24.229 [109] describes that within the IM CN subsystem, the signalling path
between a calling user and a called user can be divided into one or more
traffic legs, referred to as II-NNI traversal scenarios. Each II-NNI traversal
scenario can span networks belonging to different operators and will have its
own characteristics that can be different from other II-NNI traversal
scenarios in the same call.
Dialog creating SIP requests and standalone requests can contain an \"iotl\"
SIP URI parameter as specified in draft-holmberg-dispatch-iotl [409] in a
Request-URI or in one or more Route header fields. The \"iotl\" SIP URI
parameter can be used to identify the II-NNI traversal scenario.
If the \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter is not included in a dialog creating SIP
requests or a standalone request, the II-NNI traversal scenario type can be
determined by analysing the content of the SIP request or using a default II-
NNI traversal scenario type.
draft-holmberg-dispatch-iotl [409] defines the following iotl values:
  * homea-homeb
  * homeb-visitedb
  * visiteda-homea
  * homea-visiteda
  * visiteda-homeb
This information gives a higher granulatity of the NNI Type. Thus it is
proposed to extend the NNI Type.
### 6.4.3 Early media termination with SIP 199 response
Since there is no change of SDP the IE Early Media Description nor IE SDP
Media Component will be changes. Thus seen from time stamp the early media
will still continue till an other codec negotiation will take place.
The specifications TS 32.260 [20] nor TS 32.298 [51] does not describe how to
proceed with ending an early media with SIP 199 response.
For defining new procedures reflecting the SIP 199 e.g. define a \"STOP event
indication\" for early media, a new WID is needed. Even this functionality is
exsisting since Release 8 within the stage 3 documents.
# 7 Conclusions
During the study it was identified that several issues should be solved to
have a complete charging for roaming.
The 3 Key Issues have the most importance to be solved since they help to
identify the roaming use cases in a better way.
The following list is what SA5 has to do in recommendation for the RAVEL
issues:
Key Issue#1 proposing to include the loopback indication within the SIP
responses towards the P-CSCF and ATCF of the visited network will help and
avoid useless correlation of CDR\'s within the billing domain.
  * For this issue a Liaison will be sent to CT1 to ask for procedures to include the loopback indication within responses.
  * Based on the solution delivered b yCT1, SA5 has to adopt the needed procedures to include the NNI Information information within the P-CSCF and ATCF CDR.
Key Issue#2 proposing that the ioi values indicating the home network
delivered by the signalling should be correlated with the stored home network
id will help to secure the regarding information within the charging elements.
  * For this issue CR\'s needs to be provided to adopt the proposed changes within the SA5 documents. This needs activity by the participating delegates.
Key issue#3 proposing a LinkID will help to have a better correlation between
signalling and media plane and helps to have an easier correlation of CDR\'s
which are related to one traffic correlation.
  * since the proposed solution relates to the billing domain no activity is needed for SA5 to specify somthing. The solution the functionality is part of the billing domain and needs to be negotiated between operator and vendor within their own responsibility.
This is a list of observation where companies may provide proposals (CR\'s
and/or WID\'s):
The iotl defined in draft-holmberg-dispatch-iotl [409] value was developed in
parallel to our study which gives more information at the point of
interconnection in what scenario the call currently is.
  * Thus a documentation extension with additional procedures within is recommended. Therefore interested companies should bring up the regarding Work Item or CR\'s to work on this topic.
For media termination the SIP 199 response code should be considered in cases
where in specific cases where early media needs to be considered with regard
to billing and charging.
  * This functionality is existing since Release 8 within the CT documents. But it looked that this was never considered for charging. For introducing such procedures a new WID is needed.
  * And also new procedures for early media needs to be taken into consideration since TS 24.229 [109] changed the ruling for sending SDP within the SIP INVITE request which can be set to \"sendonly\", \"recvonly\" and \"sendrecv\".This is a change done in Release 13 so CR\'s are needed to reflect that change within SA5 Release 13 documents.
