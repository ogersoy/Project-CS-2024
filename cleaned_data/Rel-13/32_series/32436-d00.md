# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
**TS 32.432:** \"**Performance measurement; File format definition\";**
TS 32.435: \"Performance measurement; eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file
format definition\";
**TS 32.436: \"Performance measurement; Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1)
file format definition\".**
The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor 3G PLMN.
During the lifetime of a PLMN, its logical and physical configuration will
undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise the
utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed through
network configuration management activities and/or network engineering, see
3GPP TS 32.600 [4].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a PLMN network require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document and the other related 3GPP TSs
listed above is to describe the mechanisms involved in the collection of the
data.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the ASN.1 file format definition for performance
measurement results collection whose semantics is defined in 3GPP TS 32.432
[5].

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**network Element Manager (EM):** provides a package of end-user functions for
management of a set of closely related types of Network Elements. These
functions can be divided into two main categories:
\- Element Management Functions for management of Network Elements on an
individual basis. These are basically the same functions as supported by the
corresponding local terminals.
\- Sub-Network Management Functions that are related to a network model for a
set of Network Elements constituting a clearly defined sub-network, which may
include relations between the Network Elements. This model enables additional
functions on the sub-network level (typically in the areas of network topology
presentation, alarm correlation, service impact analysis and circuit
provisioning).
**Network Manager (NM):** provides a package of end-user functions with the
responsibility for the management of a network, mainly as supported by the
EM(s) but it may also involve direct access to the Network Elements. All
communication with the network is based on open and well-standardised
interfaces supporting management of multi-vendor and multi-technology Network
Elements.
**Operations System (OS):** generic management system, independent of its
location level within the management hierarchy.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations apply:

# 4 Mapping
Table 4.1 maps the file content items in the 3GPP TS 32.432 [5] to those used
in the ASN.1 (see [6]) file format definitions.

# 5 ASN.1 file format definition
The ASN.1 file format definitions implement the measurement result structure
and parameters defined in clauses 5.2 and 5.3 of 3GPP TS 32.401 [3].
For ASN.1 formatted files, BER encoding rules shall apply. Embedded comments
are integral parts of the standard format; i.e. any implementation-claiming
conformance to this annex shall also conform to the comments.

\-- The sole purpose of the ellipsis notation used in the file header is to
facilitate inter-release compatibility, vendor specific additions are not
allowed in implementations claiming conformance to the TS. However, it is
acknowledged that this feature does enable the use of non-standard extensions
to the file header without loosing compatibility to the file format specified
in the present document.
