# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
**TS 32.421: \"Subscriber and equipment trace: Trace concepts and
requirements\";**
TS 32.422: \"Subscriber and equipment trace: Trace control and configuration
management\";
TS 32.423: \"Subscriber and equipment trace: Trace data definition and
management\";
Subscriber and equipment trace provide very detailed information at call level
on one or more specific mobile(s).\ This data is an additional source of
information to Performance Measurements and allows going further in monitoring
and optimisation operations.
Contrary to Performance measurements, which are a permanent source of
information, trace is activated on user demand for a limited period of time
for specific analysis purposes.
Trace plays a major role in activities such as determination of the root cause
of a malfunctioning mobile, advanced troubleshooting, optimisation of resource
usage and quality, RF coverage control and capacity improvement, dropped call
analysis, Core Network and UTRAN end-to-end UMTS procedure validation.
The capability to log data on any interface at call level for a specific user
(e.g. IMSI) or mobile type (e.g. IMEI or IMEISV), or service initiated by a
user allows getting information which cannot be deduced from Performance
measurements such as perception of end-user QoS during his call (e.g.
requested QoS vs. provided QoS), correlation between protocol messages and RF
measurements, or interoperability with specific mobile vendors.
Moreover, performance measurements provide values aggregated on an observation
period; Subscriber and UE Trace give instantaneous values for a specific event
(e.g. call, location update, etc.).
If performance measurements are mandatory for daily operations, future network
planning and primary trouble shooting; Subscriber and UE Trace is the easy way
to go deeper into investigation and UMTS network optimisation.
In order to produce this data, Subscriber and UE Trace are carried out in the
NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an
external system (e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for
further evaluation).
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the requirements for the management of Trace
and the reporting of Trace data (including FDD mode and TDD mode) across UMTS
networks or EPS networks as it refers to subscriber tracing (tracing of IMSI
or Public User Identity) and equipment tracing (tracing of IMEI or IMEISV).
Trace also includes the ability to trace all active calls in a cell or
multiple cells (Cell Traffic Trace). The present document also includes the
description of Service Level Tracing (tracing of a specific service). It
defines the administration of Trace Session activation/deactivation by the
Element Manager (EM), the network or User Equipment (UE) itself via
signalling, the generation of Trace results in the Network Elements (NEs) and
UE and the transfer of these results to one or more Operations Systems, i.e.
EM(s) and/or Network Manager(s) (NM(s)).
GSM Trace is outside of the scope of this specification (see [7]).
The present document also describes the requirements for the management of
Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT) across UMTS networks or EPS networks and
Radio Link Failure (RLF) reporting across EPS networks.
The present document is built upon the basic Subscriber and UE Trace concept
described in clause 4.\ The high-level requirements for Trace data, Trace
Session activation/deactivation and Trace reporting are defined in clause 5.
Clause 5 also contains an overview of use cases for Trace (the use cases are
described in Annex A). Clause 6 defines the requirements for managing MDT.
Clause 7 defines the requirements for managing RLF reports.Trace control and
configuration management are described in 3GPP TS 32.422 [2], and Trace data
definition and management are described in 3GPP TS 32.423 [3].
The present document does not cover any Trace capability limitations within a
NE (e.g. maximum number of simultaneous traced mobiles for a given NE) or any
functionality related to these limitations (e.g. NE aborting a Trace Session
due to resource limitations).
The objectives of the Trace specifications are:
a) to provide the descriptions for a standard set of Trace and MDT data;
b) to produce a common description of the management technique for Trace, MDT
and RLF administration and result reporting;
c) to define a method for the reporting of Trace, MDT and RLF results across
the management interfaces.
The following is beyond the scope of the present document, and therefore the
present document does not describe:
\- tracing non-Subscriber or non-UE related events within an NE;
\- tracing of all possible parties in a multi-party call (although multiple
calls related to the IMSI specified in the Trace control and configuration
parameters are traceable).
The definition of Trace and MDT data is intended to result in comparability of
Trace and MDT data produced in a multi-vendor wireless UMTS and/or EPS
network(s), for those Trace control and configuration parameters that can be
standardised across all vendors\' implementations.
Vendor specific extensions to the Trace control and configuration parameters
and Trace and MDT data are discussed in 3GPP TS 32.422 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.423
[3].
All functions (trace, MDT etc.) specified in this specification support
Network Sharing, with the following conditions:
\- It is accepted that the recorded information from the shared nodes is
available to the Master Operator. Recorded information that is collected in a
non shared node or cell will only be available to the operator managing the
non shared node or cell.
\- It is accepted that the recorded information from the shared network shall
be delivered to the Participating Operator whose PLMN recording is requested,
taking user consent into account. Operators must also agree on sharing the
information, but how that agreement is done is outside the scope of this
specification. The mapping of TCE IP addresses and TCE addresses must be
coordinated among the operators that shares the network. How that coordination
is done is outside the scope of this specification.
\- It is accepted that the inter-PLMN recorded information for Logged MDT from
the non-shared nodes of Participating Operators may be available to the Master
Operator.
\- For signalling based activation, the operators that share a network must
coordinate the TCE IP addresses and the TCE address mapping must be
coordinated. How that coordination´ is done is outside the scope of this
specification.
\- The 3GPP Managment reference model, 3GPP TS 32.101 [1] is followed.

# 4 Trace concepts and high-level architecture
## 4.1 Trace concepts
The diversity of Trace requirements makes it difficult to identify and
anticipate all the operator\'s specific needs. Thus, the objective of this TS
is not to list an exhaustive set of information to meet all the requirements.
Rather, Trace data is defined without any limitation on the 2 following
dimensions:
\- Trace scope: NEs and signalling interfaces to Trace.
\- Trace depth: level of details of Trace data.
In order not to have any limitation of Trace data, there are six levels of
details defined: Maximum, Minimum, Medium,
MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension, MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension
and MediumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension. The first three levels allow for
vendor specific information to be traced and sent in the trace report file.
The Maximum (or MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels allow all Trace
data to be recorded. The other Levels provide a decoded subset of the data in
the Maximum Level and allow an operator the flexibility in selecting the
appropriate Trace data to record.
The Trace Depth, specified at the Trace Session activation, is used to choose
the level of detail of information to retrieve on the Itf-N.
The Maximum (or MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of detail allow
for retrieval of signalling interface messages within the Trace Scope in
encoded format (see figure 4.1.1).
Figure 4.1.1: Maximum (or MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of
details of Trace
The Minimum (or MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of detail allow
for retrieval of a decoded subset of the IEs contained in the signalling
interface messages (see figure 4.1.2).
Figure 4.1.2: Minimum (or MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of
detail of Trace
The Medium (or MediumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension) Levels of detail allow
for retrieval of the decoded subset of the IEs contained in the signalling
interface messages in the Minimum Level plus a selected set of decoded radio
measurement IEs.
The Trace data recorded at each Level is defined in 3GPP TS 32.423 [3].
## 4.2 Trace high level Architecture

Editor\'s note: The placement of the Trace Collection Entity is a deployment
matter for the operator. If it is placed outside the operator\'s secure zone,
it is up to the operator to use secure connections to and from the Trace
Collection Entity.
## 4.3 Service Level Tracing for IMS high level Architecture
There are two ways in which to activate service level trace for IMS:
a) Trace activation at the UE, and
b) Trace activation at an IMS NE.

# 5 Trace requirements
## 5.1 General trace requirements
The general high-level requirements for Trace, common to both Management
activation/deactivation and Signalling Based Activation/Deactivation, are as
follows:
\- for the Maximum Level: Trace data encompassing all signalling messages on
the different interfaces dedicated to the events of the traced subscriber or
UE with their entire content (all IEs) shall be retrieved. The operator can
then use an external system (e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN
terminology) and decode specific information in line with operator
requirements.
\- for the Minimum Level: a selected subset of IEs shall be retrieved from the
signalling interface messages. The Minimum Level provides support for the most
common use cases (described in annex A).
\- for the Medium Level: a selected Minimum Level subset of IEs from the
signalling interface messages and a selected set of radio measurement IEs
shall be retrieved.
\- for the MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension Level: it is the same as for
Maximum level without vendor specific data.
\- for the MediumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension Level: it is the same as for
Medium level without vendor specific data.
\- for the MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension Level: it is the same as for
Minimum level without vendor specific data.
The high-level requirements for Trace, specific for Service Level Tracing for
IMS are as follows:
The following high-level OMA Service Level Tracing requirements apply. (refer
to OMA Service Provider Environment Requirements [9]).
NOTE: Each referenced OMA requirement utilizes its OMA unique identifier
within square brackets. Clarification provided to each requirement should be
considered applicable to other OMA requirements using the same concepts.
  * [SLT-HL-1] with the following clarification:
\- The OMA term _OMA Service Provider Environment (OSPE)_ shall be understood
as PLMN.
  * [SLT-HL-5] with the following clarification:
\- In the context of Service Level Tracing for IMS a Minimum and Maximum level
of detail of trace only applies. Trace data for Service Level Tracing at
Minimum and Maximum level of detail shall include information associated to
_end user visible events_
  * [SLT-HL-6] with the following clarification:
\- The OMA term _service chain_ shall be understood as the relationship
between appropriate IMS elements needed to support a service. The term
_service chain_ does not imply a strict sequence of events.
\- The source of the logged trace information (e.g. IMS element including
S-CSCF) shall be identifiable when the retrieved trace information is
analyzed.
  * [SLT-HL-10] with the following clarification:
\- IMS elements that do not support Service Level Tracing shall not prohibit
the propagation of the Trace Parameter Propagation.
  * [SLT-OSR-1
\- Multiple Service Level Trace instances shall be simultaneously supported by
the PLMN and the UE (e.g. several services initiated from the same UE may each
have a Trace Recording Session Reference)
## 5.2 Requirements for Trace data
The high level requirements for Trace data, common to both Management
activation/deactivation and Signalling Based Activation/Deactivation, are as
follows:
\- The Trace records have to contain Information Elements or signalling
messages from control signalling and/or the characteristics of the user data.
The following list contains the Network Elements and the Traceable interfaces
in the NEs where tracing is needed:
\- MSC Server: A, Iu-CS, Mc and MAP (G, B, E, F, D, C) interfaces; CAP
\- MGW: Mc, Nb-UP, Iu-UP
\- HSS: MAP (C, D, Gc, Gr) Cx, S6a and S6d interfaces and location and
subscription information
\- EIR: MAP(F), S13, S13', MAP (Gf)
\- SGSN: Gb, Iu-PS, Gn, MAP (Gr, Gd, Gf), CAP (Ge) Gs, S6d, S4, S3 and S13\'
interfaces
\- GGSN: Gn, Gi and Gmb interfaces
\- S-CSCF: Mw, Mg, Mr and Mi interfaces
\- P-CSCF: Gm and Go interfaces
\- RNC: Iu-CS, Iu-PS, Iur, Iub and Uu interfaces
\- BM-SC: Gmb interface
\- e-NodeB: S1-MME, X2, Uu
\- MME: S1-MME, S3, S6a, S10, S11, S13
\- Serving Gateway: S4, S5, S8, S11
\- PDN Gateway: S2a, S2b, S2c, S5, S6b, Gx, S8, SGi
\- A unique ID within a Trace Session shall be generated for each Trace
Recording Session. This is called the Trace Recording Session Reference.
The high level requirements for Trace data applicable for Signalling Based
Activation/Deactivation for Service Level Tracing for IMS, are as follows:
\- In the context of Service Level Tracing for IMS Trace records have to
contain Information Elements or signalling messages or end user visible event
from control signalling and/or the characteristics of the user data. The
following list contains the IMS NEs and the Traceable interfaces in the NEs
where tracing is needed:
\- HSS: Sh and Cx interfaces and location and subscription information;
\- S-CSCF: ISC, Mw, Mg, Mr and Mi interfaces;
\- P-CSCF: Gm and Go interfaces;
\- I-CSCF: Mw and Cx interfaces;
\- SIP AS: ISC interface;
\- MRF: Mr interfaces;
\- MGCF: Mg interfaces;
\- BGCF: Mi interfaces;
  * A unique ID within a Trace Session shall be generated for each Trace Recording Session. This is called the Trace Recording Session Reference. In the context of Service Level Tracing for IMS the Trace Recording Session shall be unique across all IMS NEs within a PLMN.
Changes to existing NEs and interfaces above may be required. These changes
would be dependent upon various 3GPP working groups and possibly other
non-3GPP industry groups for completion of Trace Session
Activation/Deactivation.
For a detailed description of NEs and interfaces above see 3GPP TS 23.002 [4].
## 5.3 Requirements for Trace activation
### 5.3.1 Requirements for Trace Session activation
The high level requirements for Trace Session activation, common to both
Management activation and Signalling based activation), are as follows:
\- In the case of a subscriber Trace, the Trace Session will be activated for
a certain subscriber whose identification (IMSI in UTRAN/CS/PS) shall be known
in the NEs where subscriber Trace is needed.\ In the case of E-UTRAN the IMSI
shall not be included in the Trace Parameter Propagation data to the e-NodeB.
\- In the case of a UE Trace, the Trace Session will be activated for a
certain UE whose identification (IMEI or IMEISV) shall be known in the NEs
where UE Trace is needed. In the case of E-UTRAN, neither the IMEI nor IMEISV
shall be included in the Trace Parameter Propagation data to the e-NodeB -
Trace Session activation shall be possible for both home subscribers and
visiting subscribers.
\- There are two methods for Trace Session activation: Management activation
and Signalling activation.
\- For an established call/session within a Network Element, it is optional
for the Network Element to start a Trace Recording Session for the associated
Subscriber or UE upon receipt of the Trace activation request from the EM.
\- A globally unique ID shall be generated for each Trace Session to identify
the Trace Session.\ This is called the Trace Reference.\ The method for
achieving this is to divide the Trace reference into Country, Operator, and
trace Id.
\- Trace Session may be activated from the EM simultaneously to multiple NEs
with the same Trace Reference (i.e. same Trace Session).
\- The Trace Scope and Depth shall be specified within the control and
configuration parameters during Trace Session activation.
\- There can be cases in a NE when it receives multiple Trace Session
activations for the same connection (e.g. simultaneous CS/PS connections). In
these cases the starting time of the Trace Session Activation and the starting
time of the first Trace Recording Session is the same using signalling based
activation. For these cases there are two different cases for the Trace
Session activation in a Network Element when it receives another Trace Session
activation to the same subscriber or MS:
\- If the Trace Reference is equal to an existing one, a new Trace Session
shall not be started;
\- If the Trace Reference is not equal to an existing one, a new Trace Session
may be started.
\- The EM shall always provide the trace control and configuration parameters
to the appropriate NEs at the time of Trace Session activation.
\- The Trace collection entity shall be notified, in case of theTrace Session
activation has failed, by the response message with the specific cause (e.g.
overload) from the NE on which the Trace Session activation failure happened.
The high-level requirements for Trace Session activation, specific to
Signalling Based activation, are as follows:
\- Signalling based activation shall be able to capture signalling messages as
early in a session as possible, e.g. by means of a piggybacked trace
invocation message in the case of a new connection or new bearer setup
For active users, it shall be possible to start trace recording when the trace
order is received, by means of a distinct trace invocation message.
The high-level requirements for Trace Session activation, specific to
Management activation, are as follows:
\- In the case of a subscriber Trace, the Trace Session will be activated for
a certain subscriber whose identification (IMSI in UTRAN/CS/PS or Public User
Identity in IMS) shall be known in the NEs where subscriber Trace is needed.
In the case of a Cell Traffic Trace, Trace Session activation should be
possible for all calls active in a cell or multiple cells without knowledge of
the UEs' identification (IMEI or IMEISV).
\- In the case of a Cell Traffic Trace, Trace Sessions should be activated for
all the NEs where Cell Traffic Trace is specified.
\- In the case of Cell Traffic Trace (in a shared network only), a Trace
Session shall be started for UEs which are served by the Participating
Operator that has made the request to the Master Operator.
The high-level requirements for Trace Session activation specific for Service
Level Tracing for IMS are as follows:
The following high-level OMA Service Level Tracing requirements apply [9]:
  * [SLT-COM-2] with the following clarification:
\- The OMA term _component_ in the context of Service Level Tracing for IMS
shall be understood as IMS NE and UE.
  * [SLT-HL-2] with the following clarification:
\- The OMA terms _device_ and _component_ shall be understood as UE and IMS
NE, respectively;
\- The IMS NEs HSS, P/I/S-CSCF, AS and UE, apply only.
  * [SLT-AC-1] with the following clarification:
\- The OMA term _Authorised Actor_ shall be understood as NE, EM or NM;
\- The OMA term _trace indication_ shall be understood as Start Trigger Event.
  * [SLT-AC-2] with the following clarification:
\- The OMA term _Service Provider_ shall be understood as Service Provider;
\- The OMA term _marking request_ shall be understood as the ability to send
the Trace Parameter Configuration to either the UE or IMS NE.
  * [SLT-AC-6]
  * [SLT-AC-7] with the following clarification:
\- The OMA term _criteria_ shall be understood as Trace Configuration
Parameters.
### 5.3.2 Requirements for starting a Trace Recording Session
The high level requirements for starting a Trace Recording Session, common to
both Management activation and Signalling based activation), are as follows:
\- It is optional for the NE to start a Trace Recording Session if there are
insufficient resources available within the NE.
\- The Trace Recording Session Reference shall be unique within a Trace
Session.
\- The Trace Recording Session should be started after appropriate start
trigger events are detected.
The high level requirements for starting a Trace Recording Session, specific
to Management activation, are as follows:
\- Each NE shall generate its own Trace Recording Session Reference (i.e.,
independent Trace Recording Sessions).
\- Each NE shall start the Trace Recording Session based upon the Trace
control and configuration parameters received by the NE in the Trace Session
activation.
\- In the case of a trace other than Cell Traffic Trace, the correlation of
Trace data will be done with a Trace Reference and IMSI / IMEI / IMEISV /
Public User Identity.
\- The Trace Recording Session can start only when the IMSI (in the case of a
subscriber trace), the IMEI / IMEISV (in case of UE trace) or Public User
Identity (in the case of IMS) is made available in the NE. In order to trace
the early phases of the call the IMSI (in case of subscriber trace), the IMEI
/ IMEISV (in case of UE trace) or Public User Identity (in case of IMS) shall
be made available to the NE as soon as practically possible. E.g. the IMSI and
IMEI / IMEISV shall be made available to both Serving RNC and Drift RNC.
\- In the case of E-UTRAN the Core Network node that triggers a Trace
Recording Session to E-UTRAN shall either:
\- provide a trace log including Trace Reference, Trace Recording Session
Reference and the identity of the UE (i.e. IMSI or IMEI(SV) to the Trace
Collection Entity, or
\- provide a notification including Trace Reference, Trace Recording Session
Reference and the identity of the UE (i.e. IMSI or IMEI(SV)) to the Trace
Collection Entity.
\- In the case of a Cell Traffic Trace, the Trace Recording Session should
start upon the Trace control and configuration parameters being received by
the NEs in the Trace Session activation and the presence of call activity.
Furthermore, the the Core Network node that handles the traced session should
be requested to:
\- provide a trace log including Trace Reference, Trace Recording Session
Reference and the identity of the UE (i.e. IMSI or IMEI(SV) to the Trace
Collection Entity, or
\- provide a notification including Trace Reference, Trace Recording Session
Reference and the identity of the UE (i.e. IMSI or IMEI(SV)) to the Trace
Collection Entity.
\- In the case of a Cell Traffic Trace (in a shared network only), the Trace
Recording Session shall only be started for UEs which are served by the
Participating Operator that has made the request to the Master Operator.
The high-level requirements for starting a Trace Recording Session, specific
for Service Level Tracing for IMS are as follows:
The following high-level OMA Service Level Tracing requirements apply [9]:
[SLT-HL-3] with the following clarification:
\- The OMA term _marked_ shall be understood as UE or IMS NE that has
previously received Trace Parameter Configuration information.
\- The OMA term _marking_ shall be understood as Trace Parameter
Configuration.
[SLT-COM-3] with the following clarification:
\- The OMA term _indication for SLT_ shall be understood as Start Trigger
Event
\- The OMA terms _inbound_ and _outbound_ protocols shall be understood as,
for example, inbound SIP and outbound Diameter.
## 5.4 Requirements for Trace deactivation
### 5.4.1 Requirements for Trace Session deactivation
The high level requirements for Trace Session deactivation, common to both
Management deactivation and Signalling based deactivation, are as follows:
\- The Trace Session shall be deactivated using the Trace Reference specified
for the Trace Session activation.
\- The Trace Session shall be deactivated in all those NEs where it was
activated.
\- The deactivation of a Trace Session during a Trace Recording Session within
a NE may take place anytime after the NE receives the deactivation request
until the end of the current Trace Recording Session related to the traced
Subscriber or UE.
\- Trace Session deactivation in a NE could occur when two simultaneous
signalling connections for a subscriber or UE exist. E.g. figure 5.4.1 shows
NE 3 having two signalling connections (one of them or both of them are traced
with the same Trace Reference) and a Trace deactivation message is received.
The Trace Session shall be closed.
Figure 5.4.1: Trace Session closure
The high-level requirements for Trace Session deactivation specific for
Service Level Tracing for IMS are as follows:
The following high-level OMA Service Level Tracing requirements apply [9].
[SLT-COM-2] with the following clarification:
[SLT-AC-1] with the following clarification:
\- Deactivation at an IMS NE forming part of an IMS _service chain_ shall not
prohibit the propagation of the Trace Parameter Propagation.
### 5.4.2 Requirements for stopping a Trace Recording Session
The high level requirements for stopping a Trace Recording Session, common to
both Management deactivation and Signalling based deactivation, are as
follows:
\- The Trace Recording Session should be stopped after appropriate stop
trigger events are detected.
\- Trace Session deactivation in a NE could occur when two simultaneous
signalling connections for a subscriber or UE exist. E.g. figure 5.4.2 shows
NE3 having two signalling connections, but only one connection is traced. If
the non-traced connection is released, the Trace Recording Session shall be
kept in NE3. If the traced connection is released the Trace Recording Session
shall be closed.
Figure 5.4.2: Trace Recording Session closure
The high level requirements for stopping a Trace Recording Session, specific
to Signalling based deactivation, are as follows:
The Trace Recording Session should be stopped after an NE receives the
appropriate signalling deactivation message.
The high-level requirements for stopping a Trace Recording Session, specific
for Service Level Tracing for IMS are as follows:
The following high-level OMA Service Level Tracing requirements apply [9].
[SLT-AC-3] with the following clarification:
\- The implication of un-marking a UE is threefold:
a) It prohibits the initiation of further trace recording sessions from that
UE or IMS NE (i.e. subsequent services shall not be traced);
b) It cancels outstanding Trace Parameter Configuration information on a UE or
IMS NE;
c) Existing trace recording sessions active in the PLMN may continue until an
appropriate Stop Event Trigger.
## 5.5 Requirements for Trace Data reporting
The high level requirements for Trace Data reporting, common to both
Management activation/deactivation and Signalling Based
Activation/Deactivation, are as follows (Trace record contents, file formats
and file transfer mechanisms are defined in 3GPP TS 32.423 [3]):
\- Trace records should be generated in each NE where a Trace Session has been
activated and a Trace Recording Session has been started.
\- Format of the Trace records sent over Itf-N shall be XML based on the
Schema in TS 32.423 [3].
\- Trace records should be transferred on the Itf-N to the Network Manager
using one of two approaches: direct transfer from NE to NM or transfer from NE
to NM via EM.
\- Trace records may also be transferred to an external IP address (received
in Trace Control and Configuration Parameters) in 3 ways:
1) Direct transfer from NE to IP address
2) Transfer from NE to IP address via EM
3) Transfer from NE to EM. The EM notifies the holder of the IP address that
collects the files.
\- The Trace Records in a shared node for a Participating Operator's trace
request should be collected by the Master Operator's NE and may be delivered
through the Master Operator\'s management system. The Trace records shall be
made available to the Participating Operator's management system.
The high-level requirements for stopping a Trace Recording Session, specific
for Service Level Tracing for IMS are as follows:
The following high-level OMA Service Level Tracing requirements apply [9].
[SLT-HL-4] with the following clarification:
\- Encoded trace information shall be Standard File Format. Standard File
Format may not be applicable for encoded trace information at the UE.
[SLT-HL-7] with the following clarification:
\- An instance of a service level trace across a PLMN shall be uniquely
identifiable using the Trace Recording Session Reference.
[SLT-HL-8]
[SLT-COM-1] with the following clarification:
\- Time stamping alone to determine the sequence of IMS NEs performing trace
within the _service chain_ shall not be used;
\- Statistical information shall not be included as part of IMS NE
characteristics;
\- Service Level Tracing shall apply only to the IMS session layer and not the
underlying transport layers.
[SLT-COM-4] with the following clarification:
\- An IMS NE, in addition to providing trace information specific to a service
that it has traced, may also make available other information, for example,
timestamp and throughput information.
[SLT-NI-1] with the following clarification:
\- The UE shall expose a standardised interface for Trace Parameter
Configuration and the retrieval of trace information. This interface may not
be standardized by 3GPP.
[SLT-NI-2] with the following clarification:
\- An IMS NE shall transfer Trace records in Standard File Formats via Itf-N.
For transfer of Trace records via Itf-N, FTP or secure FTP shall be used.
The transfer of Trace record from the UE is For Further Study.
## 5.6 Requirements for Privacy and Security
The high-level requirements for privacy and security, specific for Service
Level Tracing for IMS are as follows:
The following high-level OMA Service Level Tracing requirements apply [9].
  * [SLT-PRV-1] with the following clarification:
\- Privacy shall be applied across the appropriate Trace Itf-N.
  * [SLT-SEC-1]
  * [SLT-SEC-2]
  * [SLT-SEC-3] with the following clarification:
\- It may not be possible to retrieve Trace information from IMS NEs from
outside the PLMN where the IMS NEs reside.
  * [SLT-IOP-1] with the following clarification:
\- The propagation of the Trace Parameter Configuration and the Start Trigger
event shall be prohibited by the PLMN when e.g. the SIP AS is hosted outside a
PLMN.
As the radio access nodes in E-UTRAN are outside an operator's secure domain,
the following requirement applies for E-UTRAN as described in 3GPP TS 33.401
[10]:
  * [SET-SEC-1] Keys stored inside eNBs shall never leave a secure environment within the eNB. When security key(s) transported on control signalling messages are included in the trace file, the key value(s) shall be removed and replaced with the value "Unavailable".
## 5.7 Requirements for Charging
The high-level requirements for charging, specific for Service Level Tracing
for IMS are as follows:
The following high-level OMA Service Level Tracing requirements apply [9].
  * [SLT-CRG-1]
## 5.8 Use cases for Trace
The operator can use Subscriber and UE Trace for numerous purposes. However,
the use cases for Trace can be divided into two basic categories:
\- Troubleshooting use cases cover situations where the operator is solving an
existing problem in his network;
\- Validation testing use cases cover situations where the operator is not
solving a known problem but merely analysing, fine-tuning or optimising his
network.
A more detailed description for the following use cases for Subscriber and UE
Trace can be found in annex A:
\- Interoperability checking between UE from different vendors;
\- QoS profile checking for a subscriber after a subscriber complaint;
\- Malfunctioning UE;
\- Checking radio coverage in a certain area;
\- Testing new features;
\- Fine-tuning and optimisation of algorithms or procedures.
The operator can use Service Level Tracing for IMS for numerous purposes.
However, the use cases for Trace can be divided into two basic categories:
\- Troubleshooting use cases cover situations where the operator is solving
existing problems with services offered to their subscribers.
\- Validation testing use cases cover situations where the operator is not
solving a known problem but performing service regression and automated
service testing.
A more detailed description of the following use cases for Service Level
Tracing can be found in annex A:
  * Automated testing of service provider services;
  * Regression testing following a network fix;
  * Service fault localization within a Service Provider's network;
  * Service fault localization when a service is hosted by a third party Service Provider.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Trace use cases
# A.1 Use case #1: multi-vendor UE validation
## A.1.1 Description
The aim of this use case is to check how different vendor\'s UEs are working
(e.g. in field testing) in the mobile network or to get detailed information
on the UE.
The study can be started by an initiative from operator for verification of UE
from different vendors (e.g. testing how the UE fulfils the requirements set
by the standards).
The operator can perform the test using test UEs or tracing subscribers\'
mobiles.
## A.1.2 Example of required data for this use case
The Trace parameters required to cover use case #1 are listed below:
\- Tracing is needed in the Radio Network (RNC) or in the Core Network (MSS,
SGSN);
\- The identification of the Trace case shall be IMEI or IMEISV (and possibly
IMSI);
\- The level of details usually is to get the most important IEs from the
signalling messages (Medium Level) or all messages with their encoded IEs
(Maximum Level).
The traceable protocols are:
\- In RNC: RRC, NBAP, RNSAP, RANAP.
\- In MSS/SGSN: DTAP messages.
# A.2 Use case #2: subscriber complaint
## A.2.1 Description
The aim of this use case is to check how the complaining subscriber\'s
services are working, to get information on the services in order to find out
the reason for the complaint.
The study can be started after a subscriber is complaining at his/her home or
visited operator that some of the service to which he/she subscribed is not
working. E.g. the subscriber:
\- cannot make calls;
\- cannot use some supplementary service;
\- does not get the negotiated QoS level (e.g. Mobile subscriber activates
video-streaming application to watch the latest sport events and every time
the subscriber tries to connect to the service the system disconnects the
subscriber\'s UMTS bearer).
As the Trace is activated for a subscriber, the signalling based Trace Session
activation shall be used, as the location of the subscriber is not known.
## A.2.2 Example of required data for this use case
The Trace parameters required to cover the use case #2 are listed below:
\- The list of NEs where tracing may be needed depends on the service being
complained about by the subscriber. For this use case, tracing should be
possible in all network elements, such as: HSS, MSS, RNC, MGW, SGSN, GGSN.
\- The identification of the subscriber in a Trace is IMSI in UTRAN/CS/PS. The
identification of the UE in a Trace is IMEI or IMEISV.
\- The data includes those Information Elements from the signalling messages,
which are related to the service(s) being complained about by the subscriber
(Medium Level).
Example cases, which can be the basis for subscriber complaint:
1\. The subscriber\'s CS call is misrouted
This illustrates an instance where a subscriber complains that his calls are
being cross-connected (or misrouted). Such a complaint involves setting up a
Trace at all the 3GPP standardised interfaces being handled by the MSC.
However, the Trace functionality shall not cover MSC internal or vendor
proprietary interfaces. The Trace record shall need to have the dialled number
and connected number.
2\. The subscriber\'s call is dropped
Tracing data is required from the radio network (UTRAN) or from the core
network (MSS, SGSN, GGSN). In the radio network the radio coverage shall be
checked. See use case #4 (checking radio coverage). Beside the radio coverage,
other information can be useful as well, like RLC parameter, power information
(OLPC or RRC measurement report), error ratios (BLER / BER, SDU error ratio),
etc. Tracing in the core network is needed also, if the problem is not in the
radio network. E.g. in case of PS domain the call can be dropped by the
application due to the long delays or congestions in TCP layer or due to bad
QoS. Thus in SGSN the requested and negotiated QoS parameters should be
included in the Trace record.
3\. The received QoS level is less than the negotiated level.
To be able to solve the possible problem Tracing data is required from HSS,
SGSN, GGSN, and UTRAN. Furthermore in case of problem in CS calls tracing in
MGW shall be performed.
From HSS Trace data the operator can monitor whether the subscriber\'s
authentication to the network is successful, and what kind of QoS parameters
are allowed to the subscriber. From SGSN Trace data the operator can monitor
PDP context creation request from mobile. Request seems to contain legal QoS
profile (incl. Maximum bandwidth, guaranteed bandwidth etc) and the local
resources in SGSN are available to provide the service as requested by the
subscriber. From UTRAN Trace data the operator can monitor whether the maximum
bandwidth and guaranteed bandwidth, requested by SGSN, acceptable for UTRAN.
Thus to check whether UTRAN can provide and maintain the requested radio
access bearer services. From GGSN Trace data the operator can monitor PDP
context activation between SGSN and GGSN. If the problem is in the CS domain
the MGW Trace can provide the QoS data.
# A.3 Use case #3: malfunctioning UE
## A.3.1 Description
The aim of this use case is to check a UE, which is not working correctly.
The study can be initiated by the operator when he/she suspects that a UE not
working according to the specifications or he/she would like to get more
information on a specific UE, which is on the grey or black EIR list.
## A.3.2 Example of required data for this use case
The Trace parameters required to cover the use case #3 are listed below:
\- UE Tracing may be needed in the Radio Network (UTRAN) or in the Core
Network (MSS, SGSN).
\- The identification of the subscriber in a Trace is IMSI. The identification
of the UE in a Trace is IMEI or IMEISV.
\- The level of details depends on the operator needs (either Minimum Level or
Medium Level).
The malfunction of UE in UTRAN can occur in different places. The problem can
be in basic RRC and RANAP signalling, Radio Bearer procedures, Handover
procedures, Power control etc.
Therefore, all RRC, RANAP, NBAP, RNSAP signalling procedures, transmission
powers, error ratios (BLER / BER, SDU error ratio) and retransmission can be
included in the Trace records.
# A.4 Use case #4: checking radio coverage
## A.4.1 Description
This use case aims at checking the radio coverage on a particular network
area.
This study can be started by an initiative from operator for testing radio
coverage on a particular geographical area following network extension for
instance (e.g. new site installation).
The operator can perform a drive test on the new site area, and check that
radio coverage is correct, or may collect Cell Traffic Trace data on all of
the cells active in the area of interest.
The other options for collecting information on radio coverage is to collect
RLF reports generated by the UE in an E-UTRAN network. .
## A.4.2 Example of required data to cover use case #4
The DL radio coverage can be checked using the values of CPICH Ec/No and RSCP
measured by the mobile on the cells in the active set and the monitored set.
These measurements are sent to the RNC trough the RRC message MEASUREMENT
REPORT.
For E-UTRAN the RLF reports contained in the UE Information Response message
provide the radio condition in terms of RSRP and RSRQ values when the Radio
Link failure happened together with a location information.
The UTRAN Trace record intra frequency measurement contains the required
information.
The UTRAN Trace record inter frequency, and inter RAT measurements can also be
used to check radio coverage with other frequencies or systems.
After a network extension, the operator can check that Ec/No and RSCP levels
on the new site area are the expected ones, and there is no coverage hole.
The following Trace parameters are required to cover use case #4:
\- The type of NE to Trace is RNC or eNB.
\- The identification of the subscriber in a Trace is IMSI. The identification
of the UE in a Trace is IMEI or IMEISV.
\- In the case of a Cell Traffic Trace, the identification of the cells where
Trace data is to be collected.
\- In case of RLF report collection the list of eNodeBs where the RLF reports
are collected.
\- The Trace data to retrieve shall contain the messages with all IEs that are
relevant for radio coverage.
# A.5 Use case #5: testing a new feature
## A.5.1 Description
This use case aims at testing the implementation of a new feature in the
network before its general deployment. The functionality can be either a
standard feature or a vendor/operator specific feature.
This study is started by an initiative from the operator.
The operator can perform a drive test on the area where the feature is
introduced, and check its good behaviour as well as its benefits, in term of
quality or capacity. He can also rely on subscribers\' Trace data when they
use the feature to be tested.
## A.5.2 Example of required data to cover use case #5
Depending on the feature, the list of NEs to Trace, as well as the level of
details can be different.
For a feature concerning Core and UTRAN networks, for instance hard handover,
SRNS relocation, or new UMTS bearer service, the operator needs to activate
Trace on several NEs.
Then, the operator can be interested in:
\- Only the protocol messages generated by the feature; or
\- The impact of the new feature introduction on the network, for instance,
the radio coverage, the capacity, the quality, or the behaviour of the
existing algorithms.
In this last case, the operator needs more detailed data, for instance
messages with all (Maximum Level) or part of the IEs (Minimum Level).
The following Trace parameters are required to cover use case #5:
\- The types of NEs to Trace are NEs that can be traced related to the
feature.
\- The identification of the subscriber in a Trace is IMSI. The identification
of the UE in a Trace is IMEI or IMEISV.
\- The Trace data to retrieve can be either only the protocol messages
(Maximum Level) or the messages with all or part of the IEs (Minimum Level).
# A.6 Use case #6: fine-tuning and optimisation of algorithms/procedures
## A.6.1 Description
Subscriber and UE Trace is part of the optimisation process. Trace data are
used to get feedback on the network quality and capacity after optimisation
operations like parameter fine-tuning, or new network design. Each
intervention to improve the network behaviour can be confirmed both by
measurement data and Trace data.
This study is started following an initiative from the operator.
The operator can perform a drive test on the area and/or activate a Cell
Traffic Trace where the optimisation has been performed, and check its good
behaviour as well as its impact on the network. He can also rely on
subscribers\' Trace data when they use the network to be optimised.
## A.6.2 Example of required data to cover use case #6
Depending on the optimisation operation, the list of NEs to Trace, as well as
the level of details can be different. But generally, fine-tuning activities
like scrambling code plan, handover and relocation algorithms, or call
admission algorithm optimisation concern a very specific part of the network.
To cover this use case, the operator is usually searching for the highest
level of details, on specific NEs.
The following Trace parameters are required to cover use case #6:
\- The types of NEs to Trace are any NE that can be traced related to the
network to be optimised.
\- The identification of the subscriber in a Trace is IMSI. The identification
of the UE in a Trace is IMEI or IMEISV.
\- In the case of a Cell Traffic Trace, the identification of the cells where
Trace data is to be collected.
\- The Trace data to retrieve are the messages in encoded format with all
(Maximum Level) or part of the IEs (Minimum Level).

# A.11 Use case #11 Analysing drop calls in E-UTRAN
## A.11.1 Description
One of the important KPIs in an operator's network is the call drop KPI. A
call drop KPI is defined also in 3GPP TS 32.450 [12]. The call drop KPI
indicates in percentage of how many successfully established calls have been
dropped. This is a crucial indicator about the quality of the network that has
clear effects to the user experience.
Therefore one of the most important targets for operator is to minimize the
value of the Call drop rate KPI. The root cause of a dropped call is typically
a radio link failure or a handover failure. Both of these failures currently
reported by the UE in the RLF reports, which additionally contain the radio
conditions at the time the failure happened. Therefore the RLF reports are
very important input for operators to determine the reasons for degradations
in Call Drop KPI. In addition the RLF reports combines the radio conditions
with location information, therefore it can serve as a valueable input for
analysis how to decrease the Call Drop KPI.
## A.11.2 Example of required data to cover use case #11
For further analysis of drop calls information is required about the radio
conditions of the radio network when the drop calls happens. In E-UTRAN the
ideal data can be collected by utilising the RLF reports defined in TS 37.320
[11]. RLF reports contain the RSRP and RSRQ values of the radio conditions at
the time when the Radio Link Failure happens that can lead in most of the
cases to a drop call. The RLF report contains also the time and location of
the RLF event.
# A.12 Use case #12 Periodical sampling of network performance
## A.12.1 Description
For management purpose, an operator need to measure statistical network
performance e.g. overall coverage status, overall voice call and data session
performance and so on. The data collected could include measurements, such as
Ec/No and RSCP for case of UMTS and RSRP and RSRQ for case of E-UTRAN, and
statistical business level KPIs such as sampled call drop rate and application
layer throughput. By periodically sampling these network performance data,
managers of the operator can monitor overall performance of the network and
compare performance differences between areas or periods. The statistical data
sampling can be performed periodically e.g. weekly or monthly. The drive test
fleet's scale makes the amount of data samples under operators control.
MDT can be used to replace or reduce drive test in this case. It is necessary
for the MDT task to collect measurements in a way similar as the drive test
do. To prevent unnecessary waste of network resources, operators need to
specify the desired maximum number and amount of data samples collected
through an MDT task. There is no need to notify the operator when the max
number or amount is reached because that will not trigger any action of the
operator. It is necessary for the operators to specify the desired minimum
number of UEs and amount of data samples collected in a MDT job so that the
data collected can meet the business and management requirements. If a MDT job
can not collect minimum amount of data in a given period of time, the operator
need to be notified quickly at the end of the time period given by the
operator so he can decide if he will need to send a drive test team in the
field to replace the MDT job.
## A.12.2 Example of required data to cover use case #12
Ideally, the data collected should include all measurements taking place in a
drive test, such as Ec/No and RSCP for UMTS and RSRP and RSRQ for E-UTRAN, and
statistical business level KPIs such as sampled call drop rate and application
layer throughput. It is not possible to ask a normal UE to perform similar
task. To make MDT a basic replacement for drive test, UE measurement such as
Ec/No and RSCP for UMTS and RSRP/RSRQ for E-UTRAN should be reported.
It shall also be possible for MDT to facilitate the introduction of future
technology to collect business level KPIs e.g. sampled call drop rate and
application layer throughput.
# A.13 Use case #13 Differentiation of area based MDT data by terminal type
## A.13.1 Description
For analysis of area based MDT data, it's useful to differentiate the MDT data
which are collected from different terminal types. For example, it allows
operators to analyze whether the poor network performance is caused by a
specific terminal type.
For privacy consideration of MDT data, operator shall also be able to select
whether the MDT data should be reported with or without the user terminal type
information.
## A.13.2 Example of required data to cover use case #13
The IMEI-TAC could be used together with MDT data and operators could use the
information to analyze whether the poor network performance is caused by
network or specific terminal types.
# A.14 Use case #14 Subscriber complaint about MBMS service in the eUTRAN
network
## A.14.1 Description
When a subscriber complains about their MBMS service, signalling based MDT for
that particular user can be triggered to analyse and troubleshoot the issue.
Operator may also want to analyse the performance or issues in the network by
looking at per subscriber MBSFN measurements.
## A.14.2 Example of required data to cover use case #14
The MBSFN MDT measurements defined in TS 37.320 [11] are required for
analysing MBMS service quality in the indicated area and for trouble shooting
per user MBMS service. The measurement quantities for E-UTRA MBSFN measurement
logging are fixed and consist of MBSFN RSRP, MBSFN RSRQ, BLER for signalling
and BLER for data per MCH, in addition to the measurement quantities for
downlink pilot strength measurements.
The MBSFN measurement results consist of, per MBSFN area where MBMS service is
received:
\- MBSFN area identity.
\- Carrier frequency.
\- MBSFN RSRP.
\- MBSFN RSRQ.
\- MCH BLER for signalling.
\- MCH BLER for data, and related MCH index.
# A.15 Use case #15 Check MBMS service quality and performance of the eUTRAN
Network
## A.15.1 Description
The operator needs information for analysing signal strength, signal quality
and block error rates for MBMS reception and quality. Logged MBSFN MDT data is
needed to support network verification, re-planning of MBSFN areas, and
optimization of MBSFN operation parameters.
## A.15.2 Example of required data to cover use case #15
