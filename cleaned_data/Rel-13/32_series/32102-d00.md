**modular:** pertaining to the design concept in which interchangeable units
are employed to create a functional end product.
**module:** interchangeable item that contains components. In computer
programming, a program unit that is discrete and identifiable with respect to
compiling, combining with other modules, and loading is called a module.
**Network** **Resource Model (NRM):** Defined in 3GPP TS 32.150 [5].
**Next Generation Networks Management (NGNM):** Planning, provisioning,
installation, maintenance, operation and administration of next generation
telecommunications equipment for transmission or control of resources and
services within NGN transport and service strata. NGNM is defined by ITU-T
[16].
**NGN service stratum:** that part of the NGN which provides the user
functions that transfer service-related data and the functions that control
and manage service resources and network services to enable user services and
applications.
**NGN transport stratum:** that part of the NGN which provides the user
functions that transfer data and the functions that control and manage
transport resources to carry such data between terminating entities.
**open specifications:** public specifications that are maintained by an open,
public consensus process to accommodate new technologies over time and that
are consistent with international standards
**open standards:** widely accepted and supported standards set by recognised
standards organisation or the commercial market place. These standards support
interoperability, portability, and scalability and are equally available to
the general public at no cost or with a moderate license fee.
**open systems strategy:** focuses on fielding superior telecom capability

**reference model:** a generally accepted abstract representation that allows
users to focus on establishing definitions, building common understandings and
identifying issues for resolution. For TMN Systems acquisitions, a reference
model is necessary to establish a context for understanding how the disparate
technologies and standards required to implement TMN relate to each other. A
reference model provides a mechanism for identifying the key issues associated
with applications portability, modularity, scalability and interoperability.
Most importantly, reference models will aid in the evaluation and analysis of
domain-specific architectures.
**scalability:** capability to adapt hardware or software to accommodate
changing workloads

requirements per standards defined in the Physical Architecture. The SA shows
how multiple systems within a subject area link and inter-operate, and may
describe the internal construction or operations of particular systems within
the architecture.

# 4 General
## 4.1 PLMN Telecom Management
### 4.1.1 3GPP Reference Model
A 3GPP System is made of the following components:
\- one or more Access Networks, using different types of access techniques
(GSM, UTRA, DECT, PSTN, ISDN, ...) of which at least one is GSM BSS, UTRA; or
LTE radio access network
\- one or more Core Networks;
\- one or more Intelligent Node Networks, service logic and mobility
management, (IN, GSM ...);
\- one or more transmission networks (PDH, SDH etc) in various topologies
(point-to-point, ring, point‑to‑multipoint etc) and physical means (radio,
fibre, copper, etc.).
The 3GPP system components have signalling mechanisms among them (DSS1, INAP,
MAP, SS7, RSVP, etc.).
From the service perspective, the 3GPP system is defined to offer:
\- service support transparent to the location, access technique and core
network, within the bearer capabilities available in one particular case;
\- user to terminal and user to network interface (MMI) irrespective of the
entities supporting the services required (VHE);
\- multimedia capabilities.
### 4.1.2 3GPP Provisioning Entities
Two major entities, which cover the set of 3GPP functionalities involved in
the provision of the 3GPP services to the user, are identified as follows:
**\- Home Environment:** This entity holds the functionalities that enable a
user to obtain 3GPP services in a consistent manner regardless of the user\'s
location or the terminal used.
**\- Serving Network:** This entity provides the user with access to the
services of the Home Environment.
### 4.1.3 Management Infrastructure of the PLMN
Every PLMN Organisation has its own Management Infrastructure. Each Management
Infrastructure will contain different functionality depending on the role-
played and the equipment used by that Entity.
However, the core management architecture of the PLMN Organisation is very
similar. Every PLMN Organisation:
\- provides services to its customers;
\- needs an infrastructure to fulfil them (advertise, ordering, creation,
provisioning, ...);
\- assures them (Operation, Quality of Service, Trouble Reporting and Fixing,
...);
\- bills them (Rating, Discounting, ...).
Not every PLMN Organisation will implement the complete Management
Architecture and related Processes. Some processes may be missing dependent on
the role a particular Organisation is embodying. Processes not implemented by
a particular Organisation are accessed via interconnections to other
organisations, which have implemented these processes (called X-interfaces in
the TMN architecture).
The Management architecture itself does not distinguish between external and
internal interfaces.
## 4.2 TMN
TMN (Telecommunications Management Network), as defined in [1], provides:
\- an architecture, made of OS (Operations Systems) and NEs (Network
Elements), and the interfaces between them (Q, within one Operator Domain and
X, between different Operators);
\- the methodology to define those interfaces;
\- other architectural tools such as LLA (Logical Layered Architecture) that
help to further refine and define the Management Architecture of a given
management area;
\- a number of generic and/or common management functions to be
specialised/applied to various and specific TMN interfaces.
The PLMN Management Architecture is largely based on TMN, and will reuse those
functions, methods and interfaces already defined (or being defined) that are
suitable for the management needs of a PLMN. However, the new challenges of
3GPP Telecom Management may require the exploration and incorporation of other
concepts (other management paradigms widely accepted and deployed).
## 4.3 Management of Next Generation Networks
Next Generation Networks (NGN) as defined in [18, 19], are essentially about
delivering new services that are available any place, any time, and on any
device, through any customer-chosen access mechanism.
NGN Management (NGNM) [16] supports the aims of the NGN by decoupling and make
independent, the service creation/deployment infrastructure from the transport
infrastructure. The decoupling is reflected in the NGN architecture as the
separation of the Transport and Service strata and shown as two independent
stratums. NGNM also introduces the NGN management plane, union of the NGN
service stratum management plane and the NGN transport stratum management
plane and may include joint management functions, i.e., functions used to
manage entities in both strata plus functions required to support this
management [18].
NGNM introduces a new set of grouping of management functionality compared to
TMN LLA to better support the complexity of the NGN .e.g. NGNM Resource
Management layer encompasses the Network Management layer and the Element
Management layer.
The PLMN management architecture will facilitate the ITU-T NGN Management
principles above where necessary and suitable.
# 5 General view of PLMN Management Physical architectures
Telecom Management Architectures can vary greatly in scope and detail. The
architecture for a large service provider, with a lot of existing legacy
systems and applications, upon which many services are based, will be of high
complexity. In contrast, the architectural needs of a start-up mobile operator
providing its services to a small group of value-added Service Providers will
be much less and will probably focus on more short-term needs.
A mobile network operator has to manage many different types of networks as
radio networks, exchanges, transmission networks, area networks, intelligent
nodes and substantial amounts of computer hardware/software. This wide variety
of network equipment will most probably be obtained from a variety of
equipment vendors. The nature of a mobile radio network will be heterogeneous
and will present a number of operational difficulties for the service provider
on enabling effective and efficient network management.
The standardisation work for the management of a PLMN has adopted the top-down
approach and will from business needs identify functional and informational
architectures. The physical architecture will have to meet these requirements
and as there are many ways to build a PLMN it will vary greatly from one TMN
solution to another. There will be many physical implementations, as different
entities will take different roles in a PLMN.
It is obvious that it will not be meaningful or even possible to fully
standardise a common Telecom Management physical architecture for PLMNs. The
present document will identify and standardise the most important and
strategic contexts and serve as a framework to help define a physical
architecture for a planned PLMN.
# 6 Basic objectives for PLMN Management Physical Architecture
The management of a 3GPP system will put a lot of new requirements to the
management systems compared to the second generation of Mobile telephony. Some
of the challenging requirements affecting the physical architecture are:
\- To be capable of managing equipment supplied by different vendors.
\- To enable TM automation in a more cost efficient way - TM optimised for
maximum efficiency and effectiveness.
\- To provide PLMN configuration capabilities that are flexible enough to
allow rapid deployment of services.
\- To report events and reactions in a common way in order to allow remote
control.
\- To allow interoperability between Network Operators/Service Providers for
the exchange of management/charging information.
\- To be scaleable and applicable to both larger and small deployments.
\- Accessibility to information.
\- To profit from advances and standards in IT and datacom industry.
The second generation of mobile networks can - from a management point of view
- be characterised as the era of vendor-dependent NE managers. The different
OSs had very low interoperability with other systems and functional blocks
could rarely be re-used. The Mobile Telecom Management Networks were far away
from the TMN vision where one vendor\'s OS should be able to manage other
vendors' network elements.
PLMN Organisations need cost-effective management solutions and better time to
market focus. Interoperability, scalability and re-use are keywords for the
new generation of management systems.
Many of the new requirements on the management of PLMNs can only be solved by
defining and establishing a suitable physical architecture. Though it is not
possible to standardise on one single TM physical architecture, it is
evidently so that the success of a Telecom Management Network of a PLMN
Organisation will heavily depend on critical physical architectural issues.
The present document will identify those architectural critical issues.
# 7 TM Architectural aspects
## 7.1 Architectural relationship
The basic aspects of a TM architecture, which can be, considered when planning
and designing a TM network are:
\- The functional architecture.
\- The information architecture.
\- The physical architecture.
The management requirements - from the business needs - will be the base for
the functional architecture, which will describe the functions that have to be
achieved. The information architecture defines what information that has to be
provided so the functions defined in the functional architecture can be
achieved. The physical architecture has to meet both the functional
architecture and the information architectures. Other constraints from realty
will also have impact to the physical architecture as cost, performance,
legacy systems and all preferences any operator will have on a big capital
investment as a TM network.
Figure 7.1: Architectural relationship
## 7.2 Architectural constraints
Large software systems, such as a network management system, are a capital
investment that operators cannot afford to scrap every time its requirements
change. Operators are seeking cost-effective solutions to their short-term
needs. All these reality-related issues are vital constraints that should be
addressed in the definition of the architecture.
The standardisation of 3GPP systems will bring new and different services that
will add new demands on telecommunications management. Every PLMN organisation
will include different functionality depending on the role-played and the
equipment used by that entity. Regulation may force some of the roles that
shall be taken. The need to link systems across corporate boundaries will be a
consequence of this.
The rapid evolution of new services and technologies will also put
requirements on the PLMN physical management architecture to accommodate
market and technology trends. To future-proof investments and continuously be
able to take advantage of new technologies are important constraints to the
physical architecture.
A PLMN TMN should also adopt an architecture that will achieve scalability and
extensibility of systems and networks so the TMN can grow as the services
expand over time. To start with a small TMN and easily be able to expand the
TMN after new requirements will be important issues for most PLMN operators.
The Telecom Management Network will be just one part of the overall business
of a company. System management, general security issues and development
strategies can be the target for company policies. System architectures and
technology choices, as well as the availability of off-the-shelf commercial
systems and software components that fulfil the requirements established in
the present document, may be critical to an operator\'s implementation of the
specified management architecture.
## 7.3 Interoperability
### 7.3.1 Introduction
The new requirement on a 3GPP system TMN will imply a focus change from
network element management towards management of information \"information
management\". Network and service providers make use of different information
in several different ways which also may vary from network to network and from
time to time. Basic information such as alarms is of course essential
information for localising faults but may also be the key information to be
able to set up a service with a service level agreement.
Numerous different interfaces can be identified in a PLMN network in the areas
of network element management, network management and service management. The
most important and complex of these interfaces will be standardised but many
interfaces of less importance are unlikely to be fully standardised and will
be up to the individual operator and vendor to develop. To adopt mainstream
computing technologies, re-use widely used protocols, standards and an open
system architecture will be essential to secure interworking between all
physical entities in a PLMN.
Low-cost and general access to management systems information will be needed.
Obviously this is the critical issue and challenging task in the
heterogeneous, distributed and complex network of a PLMN.
### 7.3.2 Interfaces
A PLMN will consist of many different types of components based on different
types of technologies. There will be access-, core-, transmission- and service
node networks and many of the components have already been the targets for
Telecom Management standardisation at different levels. Many of these
standards will be reused and the management domain of a PLMN will thereby
consist of many TMNs. The architecture of PLMN TMNs should support distributed
TMNs and TMN-interworking on peer-to-peer basis.
The Telecom Management Architecture can vary greatly in scope and detail,
because of scale of operation and that different organisations may take
different roles in a PLMN (see clause 5). The architecture of PLMN TMNs should
provide a high degree of flexibility to meet the various topological
conditions as the physical distribution and the number of NEs. Flexibility is
also required to allow high degree of centralisation of personnel and the
administrative practices as well as allowing dispersion to administrative
domains. The 3GPP Telecom Management architecture should be such that the NEs
will operate in the same way, independently of the OS architecture.
Figure 7.3.2.1 illustrates the basic domains in a 3GPP system (identified in
3GPP Technical Specifications [12], [13]), related management functional areas
and introduces Interface-N (Itf-N).
Figure 7.3.2.1: Overview of 3GPP Telecom Management Domains and Itf-N
Itf-N between the NE OSFs and NM/SM OSFs could be used by the network- and
service management systems to transfer management messages, notifications and
service management requests via the NE OSF to the Network Elements (NEs).
This interface shall be open and the information models standardised.
Telecom management interfaces may be considered from two perspectives:
1) the management information model;
2) the management information exchange.
The management information models will be standardised in other 3GPP documents
but the management information exchange will be further described in this
architectural standard.
The management task will vary greatly between different network elements in a
PLMN. Some NEs are of high complexity e.g. a RNC, while others such as border
gateways is of less complexity. Different application protocols can be chosen
to best suite the management requirements of the different Network Elements
and the technology used.
Application protocols can be categorised out of many capabilities as:
\- Functionality;
\- Implementation complexity;
\- Processor requirements;
\- Cost efficiency;
\- Market acceptance, availability of \"off the shelf commercial systems and
software\".
For each Telecom Management interface that will be standardised by 3GPP at
least one of the accepted protocols will be recommended. Accepted application
protocols (e.g. SNMP, CORBA IIOP) are defined in TS 32.101 [2], annex A.
Figure 7.3.2.2 below illustrates the basic domains in a 3GPP system
(identified in 3GPP Technical Specifications [12], [13]), related management
functional areas and introduces Interface-P (Itf-P2P).
Figure 7.3.2.2: Overview of 3GPP Telecom Management Domains and Itf-P2P
Itf-P2P between two NE OSFs (or NE Management as shown in the above figure)
could be used to transfer network management information such as network
configuration management information
The information model and the protocols used shall be those defined for
Itf-P2P. They are listed in Annex E of [2].
### 7.3.3 Entities of a 3GPP system
To provide the mobile service as defined in a 3GPP system, some specific
functions are introduced [12]. These functional entities can be implemented in
different physical equipments or gathered. In any case, exchanges of data
occur between these entities and from the Telecom Management perspective they
can all normally be treated as network elements. The basic telecom management
functional areas such as fault management, configuration management,
performance management and security management are all applicable to these
entities. As such they are all the targets for 3GPP Telecom Management
technical Specifications.
As discussed in clause 5, there will be many possible ways to build a 3GPP
system and thereby many possible architectures of a mobile system. The
entities presented in figure 7.3 should be treated as the fundamental building
blocks of any possible implementation of a 3GPP system.
Figure 7.3.3.1: Examples of entities of the mobile system to be managed
In figure 7.3.3.2 the prime domains for the standardisation effort of 3GPP
Telecom Management are shown as shaded.
Figure 7.3.3.2: High level 3GPP system Network architecture
### 7.3.4 Open systems approach
Even in the second generation of mobile radio networks the operators have to
cope with heterogeneous environments in many different ways. No single vendor
is likely to deliver all the management systems needed for a mobile operator.
The many different types of network elements, some with very high management
complexity such as an exchange and some less complex such as a repeater
system, are generally supported with unique vendor specific management systems
with very low interoperability. Duplicated TMN applications is another obvious
reality of this generation of management systems. This will be further
discussed under clause 9 (TMN Applications).
The 3GPP requirements call for open systems that can be supported by the
marketplace, rather than being supported by a single (or limited) set of
suppliers, due to the unique aspects of the design chosen. Open systems
architectures are achieved by having the design focus on commonly used and
widely supported interface standards. This should ensure costs and quality
that are controlled by the forces of competition in the marketplace.
The open systems approach is a technical and business strategy to:
\- Choose commercially supported specifications and standards for selected
system interfaces.
\- Build systems based on modular hardware and software design.
Selection of commercial specifications and standards in the Open systems
approach should be based on:
\- Those adopted by industry consensus based standards bodies or de facto
standards (those successful in the market place).
\- Market research that evaluates the short and long term availability of
products.
\- Trade-offs of performance.
\- Supportability and upgrade potential within defined cost constraint.
\- Allowance for continued access to technological innovation supported by
many customers and a broad industrial base.
### 7.3.5 Level of openness
The level the interfaces conform to open standards is critical for the overall
behaviour. A low level of openness will severely impact on long-term
supportability, interoperability, development lead-time, and lifecycle cost
and overall performance.
Interfaces are expensive parts in a TMN and interfaces with low level of
openness severely impact on development lead-time for the introduction of any
system, application component or service. Easy implementation (plug & play) is
a requirement for TMN physical entities and requires a high the level of
openness.
### 7.3.6 Closed interfaces
Many second-generation mobile network physical management entities have vendor
controlled system/subsystem boundary descriptions that are not disclosed to
the public or are unique to this single supplier - closed interfaces.
Such interfaces will not fulfil the basic requirements of a 3G TMN. Closed
interfaces can only be used as internal interfaces where no information what
so ever has to be shared to other physical management entities.
## 7.4 Data communication networks
Within a TMN, the necessary physical connection (e.g. circuit-switched or
packet-switched) may be offered by communication paths constructed with all
kinds of network components, e.g. dedicated lines, packet-switched data
network, ISDN, common channel signalling network, public-switched telephone
network, local area networks, terminal controllers, etc. In the extreme case
the communication path provides for full connectivity, i.e. each attached
system can be physically connected to all others.
The TMN should be designed such that it has the capability to interface with
several types of communications paths, to ensure that a framework is provided
which is flexible enough to allow the most efficient communications:
\- between NE and other elements within the TMN;
\- between WS and other elements within the TMN;
\- between elements within the TMN;
\- between TMNs;
\- between TMNs and enterprise.
In this case the term efficiency relates to the cost, reliability and
maintainability of the data transported.
Two aspects impact costs. The first is the actual cost to transport data
across the network between the TMN and the NE. The second aspect is the design
of the interface including the selection of the appropriate communications
protocol.
Whatever standardised protocol suite at the networking level that is capable
of meeting the functional and operational requirements (including the network
addressing aspects) of the Logical and Application Protocol levels of a given
3GPP management interface, is a valid Networking Protocol for that interface.
A number of requirements **must** be met by the Networking Protocol, as
follows:
\- Capability to run over all supported bearers (leased lines, X.25, ATM,
Frame Relay, ...)
\- Support of existing transport protocols and their applications, such as
OSI, TCP/IP family, etc.
\- Widely available, cheap and reliable.
The Internet Protocol (IP) is a Networking Protocol that ideally supports
these requirements. IP also adds flexibility to how management connectivity is
achieved when networks are rolled out, by offering various implementation
choices. For instance, these may take the form of:
\- Dedicated management intranets.
\- Separation from or integration into an operator\'s enterprise network.
\- Utilisation, in one-way or another, of capacities of the public Internet
and its applications or other resources.
## 7.5 New technologies
Meeting application requirements in the most affordable manner together with
development lead-time are important issues identified in early 3GPP management
standardisation work. But the TMN functional, information and physical
architectures should also keep pace with the introduction of new technologies,
services and evolving network infrastructures. Technology is advancing so
rapidly today that this should be a fundamental part of the physical
architecture - to be able to easily adopt new important technologies.
A 3GPP system will need to incorporate new successful technologies from the
IT-world. Today distributed computing implementations have matured to a point
where the goals of TMN can be realised using commonly available technologies
for a reasonable cost.
Widely accepted open standards and new IT-technologies will be indispensable
to fulfil the challenging managing requirements of a 3GPP system.
New technologies in the IT business such as generic application components
together with distributed processing technology are new important drivers upon
application design of management systems. The possibility to purchase
functional components from the open market are of great importance from many
aspects such as cost-efficiency and time-to-market.
# 8 3GPP Management Physical architectures
A 3GPP Telecom Management Network will consist of many different management
layers and many different building blocks. The complexity will vary greatly in
detail because every organisation has different needs. The following clause
will identify the most critical architectural issues and compliance conditions
for a given 3GPP management interface. It should serve as fundamental
requirements for any 3GPP entity (network element or management system) being
a part of a 3GPP TMN.
## 8.1 Compliance Conditions
For a 3GPP entity (management system or NE) to be compliant to a given
management interface, all the following conditions shall be satisfied:
1) It implements the management functionality specified in the relevant IRP
Information Service specifications.
2) It provides at least one of the IRP Solution Sets (were available) related
to the valid Application Protocols specified by 3GPP Application Protocols for
that interface, [2] annex C.
3) It provides at least one standard networking protocol.
4) In case the entity does not offer the management interface on its own, a
Q‑Adapter shall be provided. This Q‑Adapter shall be provided independently of
any other NE and/or management system.
5) Support for Bulk Transfer Application Protocols specified by the relevant
3GPP management interface specifications applicable to that interface.
## 8.2 Network Element (NE) management architecture
Figure 8.2 shows two possible options for management interface from the OS
upper layers to NE. Option 1, provides access to the NE via element manager,
and Option 2, provides a direct access. It is sufficient to provide one or the
other.
Figure 8.2 does not imply and limit the realisation of any OS physical block
(e.g. E-OS, N-OS) to just one logical layer. OS physical blocks may span more
than one logical layer (ITU‑T Recommendation M.3010 [1]). Different types of
network elements, different functional areas, operator and vendor preferences
etc will put different constraints on the physical realisation of the OSFs.
See further clause 9.
Figure 8.2: Network Element Management Architecture
For a 3GPP entity (Network Element or management system) to be compliant to a
given management interface the following conditions shall all be satisfied:
+------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | Item | Compliance conditions | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1 | Implements relevant 3GPP IRP Information Service | | | specifications. | | | | | | For an interface illustrated by the dashed line in figure 4 | | | the object model is not standardised but it shall be open | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | 2 | Application protocol (e.g. SNMP,CORBA IIOP)\ | | | (Defined in TS 32.101 [2], annex A) | | | | | | If 3GPP has specified one or more IRP Solution Sets | | | corresponding to the IRP Information Services in item 1 then | | | at least one of those IRP Solution Sets shall be supported. | | | | | | (Defined in TS 32.101 [2], annex C) | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | 3 | Valid Network Layer Protocol\ | | | (see annex B of TS 32.101 [2]) | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | 4 | Lower protocol levels required by Item 1, 2 and 3 | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
## 8.3 Subnetwork Management Architecture
(Example 3GPP RNC / NodeB)
An important special case of the network element management architecture is
where one type of network element such as the RNC will need management
information for co-ordination of a subnetwork of other types of network
elements such as NodeB.
This management information shared between the RNC and NodeB will not reach
the operators and is not considered to be a part of the 3GPP TMN. All other
management information related to NodeB will transparently be transferred by
the RNC towards the 3GPP TMN.
Figure 8.3: Subnetwork Management Architecture
The same compliance conditions apply for the subnetwork management
architecture as for the network element management architecture (see clause
8.2).
## 8.4 Operations Systems interoperability architecture
Interoperability between operations systems is an important issue in a 3GPP
system. Different organisations may take different roles in a 3GPP system. The
need to share information across corporate boundaries will be a consequence of
this.
The heterogeneous, distributed and complex network of a 3GPP system will be a
market for many different vendors. All operations systems have to interoperate
and shall be able to share information. This is a critical issue in the
management of third generation systems.
Figure 8.4: Operations Systems interoperability Architecture
For a Operations System to be 3GPP TMN compliant the following conditions
shall all be satisfied:
+------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | Item | Compliance conditions | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | 1 | Implements relevant 3GPP IRP Information Service | | | specifications. | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | 2 | Application protocol (e.g. SNMP,CORBA IIOP)\ | | | (Defined in TS 32.101 [2], annex A) | | | | | | If 3GPP has specified one or more IRP Solution Sets | | | corresponding to the IRP Information Services in item 1 then | | | at least one of those IRP Solution Sets shall be supported.\ | | | (Defined in [2], annex C) | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | 3 | Valid Network Layer Protocol\ | | | (see annex B of TS 32.101 [2]) | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | 4 | Lower protocol levels required by Item 1,2 and 3 | +------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

## 8.6 Enterprise management System interconnection architecture
The business enterprise layer has in the second-generation systems a very low
degree of standardisation. Operators have legacy systems or more IT influenced
systems often adopted to every organisations different needs. Enterprise
management systems are not a part of a 3GPP TMN.

# 9 TMN applications
Telecom management applications can be implemented in many different ways
depending on constraints presented in previous clauses. The TMN application -
the operations systems component (OSC) -is the physical realization of one or
more OSFs needed to support the operational processes. An up-to-date
Operations System would be assembled from one or more OS components which
expose standardized interfaces to allow for more flexible and agile OSs.
To identify and specify the design criteria that will allow re-usable
application components to be developed across multiple telecom business
scenarios are important issues to fulfil the basic 3GPP Management
requirement. \"To minimise the costs of managing a PLMN such that it is a
small component of the overall operating cost\".
The implication of the top down approach in the standardising work of 3G is
that consistent operational management processes are required irrespective of
vendor equipment.
Generic and re-usable management applications are required to facilitate:
\- Reduced management application development costs.
\- Simplification of operational processes and associated reduction in costs.
\- Reduced time to deploy new services as management systems already exist.
\- Consistent representation of basic
information.[]{#__RefHeading___Toc217150348 .anchor}The complexity and
heterogeneous nature of a 3GPP system calls for easy integration (plug&play)
of HW/SW.
## 9.1 Management function blocks
A management function is the smallest part of a business process (or
management service), as perceived by the user of the process (or service). A
management function block is the smallest deployable unit of management
functionality. Figure 9.1 illustrates the different types of optional
management function blocks. For example physical views and mapping to 3GPP
PLMN management interfaces, see subclause 9.2 and 9.3. The OSF
specializations/decompositions reflect the high level processes identified in
ITU-T TMN Enhanced Telecom Operations Map(eTOM), M.3050.x series, ref[20].,
See further M.3060/Y.2401 ref [16].

Figure 9.1: Management function blocks in M.3060/Y.2401 [16]
## 9.2 Management physical blocks
Figure 9.2-1 illustrates example implementations of physical views. The OS
physical block realizes OSFs, of which a great variety is available. Some will
be consequence of 3GPPs decision to base the management processes on Enhanced
Telecom Operations Map [2],[9],[20], others on enabling support for the
management of Next Generation Networks [16], [17].

Figure 9.2-1: An example implementation of a physical view in M.3060/Y.2401
[16]
The physical architecture may flatten the functional Management Layers into a
single, unified management layer for the co-management of several functional
Management Layers to facilitate a unified handling of e.g. alarms and
performance data. There is great flexibility in the design of Next Generation
Network Operations Systems with this concept, see further Annex 1. The
flexibility can enable co-management of multiple functional layers as
presented in Figure 9.2-2. The interfaces depicted in fig. 9.2-1 and 9.2-2 are
in the 3GPP PLMN management architecture mapped to the Itf-N or Itf-P2P
interface between an IRPManager and IRPAagent, as shown in fig. 9.3.

Figure 9.2-2: Co-management of multiple functional management layers in
M.3060/Y.2401 [16]
## 9.3 IRP concept enabling TMN applications
3GPP has developed the interface concept "Integration Reference Point" (IRP)
to promote the wider adoption of standardized management interfaces in
telecommunication networks. The concept is presented in TS32.150 [5]. These
IRPs are provided by an IRPAgent and managed via an IRPManager. The IRPs are
the prime enabler of flexibility in the design of management physical blocks
(OSs).
In the context of management of Next Generation Networks the IRPAgent and
IRPManager represents the provider reference point and respectively the
consumer reference point, respectively. See figure 9.3.
The IRP concept may be mapped to all of the management physical blocks. The
3GPP PLMN Management Architecture will focus on those functions, methods and
interfaces that the new challenges of 3GPP Telecom Management may require. The
detailed and final standardization requirements will be targeted in other
32.*** series and 28.*** series of standards.
Figure 9.3: IRPAgent and IRPManager using NGN principles
# 10 Void
# 11 Implementation aspects
PLMN operators might categories and organise its operation systems in many
different ways as:
\- A national fault and performance OS.
\- A national charging, billing and accounting OS.
\- Regional configuration OS.
\- Regional fault, performance and configuration OS.
\- etc.
This geographical dependent categorisation may change after time and the
growth of the network. A physical architecture based on an open system design
and re-usable application components would ease the work to adopt such
structural changes. A management system build for a PLMN shall provide the
possibility of layering the applications.
# 12 3GPP TMN Conformance
The goal of TMN conformance (see ITU-T Recommendation M.3010 [1]) is to
increase the probability that different implementations within a TMN will be
able to interwork, that TMNs in different service/network provider\'s
administrations and customer\'s system will be able to interwork as much as
agreed on.
TMN conformance are testable conditions.
It is only the requirements on the external behaviour that have to be met by
the conformance statements.
To finally guarantee interoperability the purchaser/user shall be able to test
and verify that any two systems, claiming any type of TMN conformance,
interoperate. Interoperability testing shall include:
\- Testing of the interface protocols;
\- The shared/exposed information over those interfaces;
\- The interface functionality of the system.
A 3GPP TMN conformant entity shall support necessary information to support
such interoperability testing namely:
\- Statements made by the supplier of an implementation or system claimed to
conform to a given specification, stating which capabilities and options have
been implemented.
\- Detailed information to help determine which capabilities are testable and
which are un-testable.
\- Information needed in order to be able to run the appropriate test.
\- The system interface documentation shall list the documents that define the
specified information models with the inclusion of the version number and
date.
\- Necessary information about vendor supplied extensions of a standardised
interface
The interface specification shall be documented, publicly available and
licensable at reasonable price on a non-discriminatory basis.
Specific conformance guidelines shall be included in the different IRP
solution sets. A 3GPP TMN conformant entity **must** support information
stated in those conformance guidelines.
# 13 TMN planning and design considerations
A TMN should be designed such that it has the capability to interface with
several types of communications paths to ensure that a framework is provided
which is flexible enough to allow for the most efficient communications:
\- Between one NE and other elements within the TMN;
\- Between a WS and other elements within the TMN;
\- Between elements within the TMN;
\- Between TMNs.
The basis for choosing the appropriate interfaces, however, should be the
functions performed by the elements between which appropriate communications
are performed. The interface requirements are specified in terms of function
attributes needed to provide the most efficient interface.
## 13.1 Function attributes
a) _Reliability_ \- The capability of the interface to ensure that data and
control are transferred such that integrity and security are maintained.
b) _Frequency_ \- How often data is transferred across the interface boundary
(Normal behaviour).
c) _Quantity_ \- The amount of data that is transferred across the interface
during any transaction.
d) _Priority_ \- Indicates precedence to be given to data in case of
competition for network resources with other functions.
e) _Availability_ \- Determines the use of redundancy in the design of the
communications channels between interfacing elements.
f) _Delay_ \- Identifies the amount of buffering that may be tolerable between
interfacing elements. This also impacts communications channel designs.
Table 13.1 suggests a possible ranges for these function attributes.
Table 13.1: Possible ranges for TMN function attributes [1]

* * *
## 13.2 Functional characteristics
Each major type of telecommunications equipment has functional characteristic
needs that can be used to describe the complexity of the interface.
There are, however, a basic group of TMN application functions that cross all
major types of telecommunications equipment. There are also unique TMN
application functions that are performed by specific categories of major
telecommunications equipment. Alarm surveillance is an example of the former,
whereas billing information collection is an example of the latter.
Functional characteristics of the elements within a TMN, e.g. OS, DCN and MD
also describe the complexity of interfaces between these elements.
## 13.3 Critical attributes
Attribute values for a given function are generally consistent across the
network elements.
When considering a single interface, it is important to identify the
controlling attribute ranges for the design of the interface.
If there are conflicting attribute values for different functions in a given
network element, more than one instance of an interface may be needed.
Overall TMN attribute values for the interfacing of elements within the TMN
depend on the type and number of functions performed within these elements. In
this case the functions are not consistent across TMN elements, but are
controlled by the individual TMN design of an Administration.
## 13.4 Protocol selection
In many cases, more than one protocol suite will meet the requirements for the
network element or TMN element under consideration. It is the approach for the
3GPP Telecom management standardisation to concentrate on protocol independent
information models, allowing the mapping to several protocol suites.
The rationale behind this is:
\- The blurring of Information and Telecommunication technologies in a 3GPP
system, it is required to work on a more open approach (acknowledging the
market status and foreseen evolutions).
\- The lifecycle of information flows is 10 to 20 years, while the protocols
is 5 to 10 years.
\- The developments on automatic conversion allows for a more pragmatic and
open approach.
The choice of the individual protocol from the recommended family will be left
open to the vendors and operators.
To provide the most efficient interface care should be taken to select the
protocol suite that optimises the relationship between the total cost to
implement that protocol suite, the functional attributes and the data
communications channels that carry the information across the interface.
## 13.5 Communications considerations
DCN architectures should be planned and designed to ensure that their
implementation provides appropriate degrees of availability and network delay
while minimising cost.
One should consider the selection of communications architectures, e.g. star,
multipoint, loop, tree, etc.
The communications channels, e.g. dedicated lines, circuit-switched networks
and packet networks used in providing the communications paths, also play an
important role.
# 14 Mediation/Integration
The increase in the need to incorporate a hybrid set of technologies, multiple
protocols and heterogeneous resources requires the availability of open
management interfaces between the management systems and the different network
resources. These interfaces require an underlying mechanism to mediate -
interpret, translate, and handle data - between the various data
representations and protocols. A set of Technology Integration Points [10] can
be identified.
Software components on the open market as automatic conversion applications,
gateways, mediation applications will be valuable products to fulfil the
challenging task to incorporate multiple protocols and heterogeneous
resources.
Figure 14.1 summarises Technology Integration Points for some example
technologies:
Figure 14.1: Example of Technology Integration Points [10]
Essentially, figure 14.1 indicates that from the technologies selected, a
number of technology areas will need to be integrated. These are:
\- Internet/Web based services;
\- Object Request Broker (CORBA) based services;
\- Telecom based Manager/Agent services (e.g. CMIP/GDMO and SNMP/SMI).
In order to provide adequate points of integration between these areas of
technology, a number of Integration Points (IPs) have been identified \- as

###### ## Annex A (informative): Technology considerations
# A.1 Management physical blocks
TMN functions can be implemented in a variety of physical configurations
(ITU-T Recommendation M.3010 [1], M3060/Y.2401 [16]). The relationship of the
functional blocks to physical equipment is shown in table A.1 which names the
management physical blocks according to the set of function blocks which each
is allowed to contain. For each physical block there is a function block which
is characteristic of it and is mandatory for it to contain. There also exist
other functions, which are optional for the physical blocks to contain. Table
A.1 does not imply any restriction of possible implementations. The M/O
qualifiers are examples from M3060/Y.2401 [16] and do not have any implication
for compliance in the 3GPP PLMN management architecture.
The subclauses below give the definitions for consideration in implementation
schemes.
Table A.1: Relationship of management physical block names to management
function blocks
+-----------------------------------+------------+------------+-----+ | | TEF | SEF | OSF | +-----------------------------------+------------+------------+-----+ | **NE** | M (Note 3) | M (Note 3) | O | +-----------------------------------+------------+------------+-----+ | **OS** | | | M | +-----------------------------------+------------+------------+-----+ | M Mandatory | | | | | | | | | | O Optional | | | | | | | | | | NOTE 1: Within this table, where | | | | | more than one name is possible, | | | | | the choice of the physical block | | | | | name is determined by the | | | | | predominant usage of the block. | | | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: Management physical | | | | | blocks may contain additional | | | | | functionality, which allows them | | | | | to be managed. | | | | | | | | | | NOTE 3: The NE needs to support | | | | | at least one of the TEF or SEF. | | | | +-----------------------------------+------------+------------+-----+
## A.1.1 Operations System (OS)
The OS is the system, which performs OSFs.An OS may conceptually be considered
as part of the NGN transport stratum, the NGN service stratum, both, or
neither, depending on the OSFs that it realizes.
## A.1.2 Void
## A.1.3 Void
## A.1.4 Void
## A.1.5 Void
## A.1.6 Void
## A.1.7 Void
## A.1.8 Network Element (NE)
The NE is comprised of telecommunication equipment (or groups/parts of
telecommunication equipment) and support equipment or any item or groups of
items considered belonging to the telecommunications environment that performs
NEFs. The NE may optionally contain any of the other management function
blocks according to its implementation requirements. The NE has one or more
standard Q-type interfaces and may optionally have B2B/C2B interfaces. An NE
performs at least one of transport element functions (TEFs) or service element
functions (SEFs), and so can be deployed in an NGN transport stratum or in an
NGN service stratum or in both.
Existing NE-like equipment that does not possess a standard management
interface will gain access to the management infrastructure via a Q adapter
(see A.1.9.1.1), which will provide the necessary functionality to convert
between a non-standard and standard management interface.
A Transport Network Element is an NE that performs only TEFs. A Service
Network Element is an NE that performs only SEFs.
## A.1.9 Data Communication Network (DCN)
The DCN is a support service that provides the capability to establish paths
for information flow between physical blocks in a management environment. The
DCN may consist of a number of interconnected subnetworks of different types.
The DCN may be a local path or a wide-area connection among distributed
physical blocks. The DCN is technology-independent and may employ any single
or combination of transmission technologies.
In order for two or more physical blocks to exchange management information,
they must be connected by a communications path and each element must support
the same interface onto that communications path.
Physical blocks communicate using a common communication mechanism which
provides a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that include the
services of the upper three protocol layers of the OSI Reference Model. Some
of these API services expose the communications capabilities of the DCN and
others expose common platform functions (e.g., Directory Services, Time
Services, Security, etc.). Refer to ITU-T Recs Q.811 and Q.812 for specific
interface protocols for information transfer through a DCN.
### A.1.9.1 Transformation
Transformation provides conversion between different protocols and data
formats for information interchange between physical blocks. There are two
types of transformation: adaptation and mediation that can apply at q or
b2b/c2b reference points.
#### A.1.9.1.1 Adaptation device
An adaptation device (AD), or adapter, provides transformation between a non-
compliant physical entity to a NE to OS within an administrative domain. A
Q-adapter (QA) is a physical block used to connect NE-like or OS-like physical
blocks with non-compatible interfaces to Q interfaces. A B2B/C2B-adapter is a
physical block used to connect non-compatible physical entities having a non-
compatible communication mechanism in a non-compatible environment to an OS at
the edge of an administrative domain.
#### A.1.9.1.2 Mediation device
A mediation device (MD) provides transformation between management physical
blocks that incorporate incompatible communication mechanisms. A Q-mediation
device (QMD) is a physical block that supports connections within one
administrative domain. A B2B/C2B-mediation device is a physical block that
supports connections of OSs in different administrative domains
### A.1.9.2 Distributed multi-element structure
A distributed multi-element structure is an architectural concept that
represents a grouping of network elements that must be managed as a single
entity for operational efficiency sake. Due to the distributed nature of their
blocks and the complexity of their internal make up, it is sometimes difficult
to distinguish between Distributed multi-element structures and a sub-network.
## A.1.10 Management logical layered architecture within the management
physical view
Several specializations of the OS physical block can be defined to support a
physical realization of function blocks in logical layers (see Figures 9.1).
The variety of types of management functionality is reflected in a
corresponding flexibility for the mapping of OSFs to Operations Systems so
that, in principle, any combination of specialized OSFs can map to an
Operations System. As a result, the interfaces offered by an Operations System
may include functionality from various OSF specializations (e.g., service
management, service resource management and transport resource management
functions).
Such a flexible transition from the functional view to a physical view
(subject to constraints from the information architecture as outlined in
clause 14) allows for different types of OS interactions and corresponding
Operations Systems Interface design patterns:
> \-- Provider/consumer;
>
> \-- Peer-to-peer.
As a result, a physical architecture may flatten the functional Management
Layers described in 11.6 into a single, unified management layer for the co-
management of several functional Management Layers. Examples of this layer co-
management paradigm are shown in Figures 9.2-1 and 9.2-2.
The unified management layer is opaque, i.e., the interworking of the
functional Management Layers is invisible to the user of the Interface.
## A.1.11 Interface concept
Management interface is an architectural concept that provides interconnection
between physical blocks at reference points. Management interfaces provide,
via specific communication protocols, for the interconnection of NEs and OSs
through the DCN. Interactions between physical blocks, to exchange management
information, are established dynamically at run time and are usually not
defined statically at design time. In order for such dynamic interactions to
occur, physical blocks must be connected by a communications path and each
element must support compatible interfaces. It is useful to use the concept of
an interface to simplify the communications problems arising from a multi-
vendor, multi-capability network. The interface defines the specific
protocols, commands, procedures, message formats and semantics used for the
management communications between physical blocks. The goal of an interface
specification is to ensure compatibility of devices interconnected to
accomplish a given management function independent of the type of device or of
the supplier.
Figure A.2 shows the interconnection of the various management physical blocks
by a set of standard interoperable interfaces.
Management standard interfaces are defined corresponding to the reference
points and are classified in two types:
> \-- Provider interfaces: physical realizations of one or more provider
> reference points; each provider interface is depicted with a white lollipop
> or ball icon.
>
> \-- Consumer interfaces: physical realizations of one or more consumer
> reference points; each consumer interface is depicted with a white crescent
> or socket icon.
An interface contains the mapping from the protocol-neutral reference point
specifications to a protocol-specific specification. An interface consists of
one or more reference points together with a single communication protocol
binding, which is a protocol suite used to realize a communications path at
these reference points.
# A.2 Standard interfaces
Management standard interfaces are realizations of specific reference points.
The classes of references points correspond to the classes of interfaces.
Figure A.2 shows an example of a simplified physical view for a management
implementation. This example is provided to assist in understanding the
management physical blocks described in A.1.

management areas
All the following interfaces are illustrated in figure B.1:
\- Itf-T between a terminal and a NE Manager. This interface will in some
extent manage the 3GPP terminal and the USIM of the subscriber. Requirements
of this interface are for further study.
\- Itf-B and Itf-R between UTRAN and a NE Manager.
\- Itf-G1 between GSM NSS and NE Manager.
\- Itf-G2 between GSM BSS and NE Manager. This interface is standardised in
GSM 12-series specifications.
  * Itf-G3 between GPRS NEs and a NE Manager.
