# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
The present document is part 4 of a multi-part conformance test specification.
The specification contains a TTCN design frame work and the detailed test
specifications in TTCN for the UE:
\- A-GPS at the UTRA Uu interface in TTCN-2;
\- A-GNSS at the UTRA Uu interface in TTCN-3;
\- LTE positioning at the LTE-Uu interface in TTCN-3.
The present document is part 4 of a multi-parts TS:
**-** 3GPP TS 37.571-1: Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) and Evolved
UTRA (E-UTRA) and Evolved Packet Core (EPC); User Equipment (UE) conformance
specification for UE positioning; Part 1: Terminal conformance.
**\- 3GPP TS 37.571-2:** Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) and

# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the protocol and signalling conformance testing
in TTCN for the UE:
\- A-GPS at the UTRA Uu interface;
\- LTE positioning at the LTE-Uu interface;
\- A-GNSS at the UTRA Uu interface.
The following TTCN test specification and design considerations can be found
in the present document:
\- Test system architecture;
\- Test models and ASP definitions;
\- Test methods and usage of communication ports definitions;
\- Test configurations;
\- Design principles and assumptions;
\- TTCN styles and conventions;
\- Partial PIXIT proforma;
\- Test suites in TTCN-2 and TTCN-3;
\- The Test Suites designed and implemented in the present document are based
on the test specifications in prose in 3GPP TS 37.571‑2 [3];
\- The applicability of the individual test cases is specified in the test ICS
proforma specification in 3GPP TS 37.571‑3 [4].
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document in the same
Release as the present document unless the context in which the reference is
made suggests a different Release is relevant (information on the applicable
release in a particular context can be found in e.g. test case title,
description or applicability, message description or content).
