# 4 General test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.
The minimum requirements are given in TS 37.104 [2] and the references
therein. Test requirements are given in this specification or are included by
reference to TS 25.141 [10], TS 25.142 [12], TS 36.141 [9] or TS 51.021 [11].
Test Tolerances for the test requirements explicitly stated in the present
specification are defined in Annex C of this specification. Test Tolerances
for test requirements included by reference are defined in the respective
referred test specification.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
included by reference is defined in the respective referred test
specification.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.
Unless otherwise stated, the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2 apply to the
Test System for testing E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/EDGE and NB-IoT MSR BS.

The applicable test configurations for each RF requirement are defined in sub-
clause 5.1 and 5.2 for the declared capability set(s). For a BS declared to be
capable of multi-band operation, the applicable test configurations for each
RF requirement are defined in sub-clause 5.3 for the declared capability
set(s).
NOTE: Not every supported configuration within a CS is tested, but the tables
in sub-clause 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 provide a judicious choice among the supported
configurations and test configurations to ensure proper test coverage.
### 4.7.2 Manufacturer\'s declarations of supported RF configurations
The manufacturer shall declare which operational configurations the BS
supports by declaring the following parameters:
a) General Parameters:
\- Support of the BS in non-contiguous spectrum operation. If the BS does not
support non-contiguous spectrum operation the parameters for non-contiguous
spectrum operation below shall not be declared.
\- The supported operating bands defined in subclause 4.4.
\- The frequency range within the above frequency band(s) supported by the BS.
\- Supported capability set(s) in each supported operating band
\- The maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth supported by a MSR BS within an
operating band when the BS is configured with carriers of different RATs.
\- for contiguous spectrum operation.
\- for non-contiguous spectrum operation
\- The rated total output power as a sum over all RATs
\- for contiguous spectrum operation.
\- for non-contiguous spectrum operation
\- Maximum supported power difference between carriers
\- Total number of supported carriers
For MSR BS supporting CS7, the rated total output power as a sum over all
RATs, total number of supported carriers and the maximum Base Station RF
Bandwidth is declared in e).
If the rated total output power and total number of supported carriers are not
simultaneously supported in Multi-RAT operations, the manufacturer shall
declare the following additional parameters:
\- The reduced number of supported carriers at the rated total output power in
Multi-RAT operations (i.e. \ \- The Base Station RF Bandwidth shall be the declared maximum Base Station

\- Place a GSM carrier at the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. Place a 10
MHz E-UTRA carrier adjacent to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. Place
the power boosted NB-IoT PRB at the outermost guard-band position eligible for
NB-IoT PRB (according to sub-clause 4.5.3)at the upper Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge and adjacent to the E-UTRA PRB edge as close as possible (i.e.,
away from the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge). The specified F~Offset-
RAT~ shall apply.
\- For transmitter tests, add GSM carriers at the edges using 600 kHz spacing
until no more GSM carriers are supported or no more GSM carriers fit, then
select as many 10 MHz E-UTRA carriers that the BS supports and that fit in the
rest of the Base Station RF Bandwidth. Place the carriers adjacent to each
other starting from the high Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. The nominal
carrier spacing defined in subclause 4.5.1 shall apply.

Set the power of each carrier to the same power so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the rated total output power according to the manufacturer's
declaration in subclause 4.7.2.
## 4.9 RF channels and test models
### 4.9.1 RF channels
Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth
located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range in the
operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and
T~RFBW~ (top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and
T~RFBW~ defined as following:
B~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
M~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band. M~RFBW~ may be shifted
maximum 100 kHz towards lower frequencies to align carriers with the channel
raster.
T~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band.
For the test of certain RF requirements the present specification refers to
test procedures defined in the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the
interpretation of the RF channels to be tested shall be according to the
definitions in the corresponding single-RAT specifications.
For BS capable of dual-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the test shall
be performed at B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~_ T'~RFBW~: the Base Station RF Bandwidths located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the highest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum Radio Bandwidth,
in the upper operating band.
\- B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW:~ the Base Station RF Bandwidths located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the upper operating band and at the lowest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum Radio Bandwidth,
in the lower operating band.
NOTE: B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ = B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ when the declared
Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans both operating bands. B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ means the
Base Station RF Bandwidths are located at the bottom of the supported
frequency range in the lower operating band and at the top of the supported
frequency range in the upper operating band.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in each supported operating band, the position of
B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating band
combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may consult
with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.10.1-1: Transmitter test ports
#### 4.10.1.1 Transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present document,
the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector in the case of
transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors.
Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to measure
the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors.
### 4.10.2 Receive configurations
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics in clause 7 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.10.2-1: Receiver test ports
#### 4.10.2.1 Reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors, receiver
diversity
For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement applies at
each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna diversity or in the
case of multi-carrier reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors.
Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the remaining
receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector (s) being terminated. If the
manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be equivalent, it is
sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any one of the receiver
antenna connectors.
For a multi-band BS, multi-band tests for blocking and intermodulation are
performed with the interferer(s) applied to each antenna connector mapped to
the receiver for the wanted signal(s), however only to one antenna at a time.
Antenna connectors to which no signals are applied are terminated.
### 4.10.3 Duplexers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer fitted,
if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS.
NOTE: The present release of this specification does not contain test
requirements for the case that the duplexer is supplied as an option by the
manufacturer. This is left for future releases.
### 4.10.4 Power supply options
If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply configurations,
it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the power supply
options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of conditions
over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the range of
conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be supplied
either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In this case, the
conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power supply options can be
tested by testing only the external DC supply option. The range of DC input
voltages for the test should be sufficient to verify the performance with any
of the power supplies, over its range of operating conditions within the BS,
including variation of mains input voltage, temperature and output current.
### 4.10.5 Ancillary RF amplifiers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with the ancillary RF
amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7 for TX and RX
respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting
network (including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to
make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary amplifier and
the BS. The applicable connecting network loss range is declared by the
manufacturer. Other characteristics and the temperature dependence of the
attenuation of the connecting network are neglected. The actual attenuation
value of the connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the
applicable extreme values. The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.
Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted and,
if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.
When testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to Table 4.10.5-1, where x denotes that
the test is applicable:
Table 4.10.5-1: Tests applicable to ancillary RF Amplifiers

* * *
NOTE: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The amplifiers
can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of these amplifiers
could be a passive network.
In test according to subclauses 6.2 and 7.2 highest applicable attenuation
value is applied.
### 4.10.6 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the integrated
Iuant BS modem shall be switched off. Spurious emissions according to clauses
6.6.4 and 7.7 shall be measured only for frequencies above 20MHz with the
integrated Iuant BS modem switched on.
### 4.10.7 BS using antenna arrays
A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some or all
of its transceivers or with an antenna array related to one cell (not one
array per transceiver). This subclause applies to a BS which meets at least
one of the following conditions:
\- the transmitter output signals from one or more transceiver appear at more
than one antenna port; or
\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a transceiver or per cell
and an input signal is required at more than one port for the correct
operation of the receiver thus the outputs from the transmitters as well as
the inputs to the receivers are directly connected to several antennas (known
as \"aircombining\"); or
\- transmitters and receivers are connected via duplexers to more than one
antenna.
In case of diversity or spatial multiplexing, multiple antennas are not
considered as an antenna array.
If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with an antenna system
which contains filters or active elements which are necessary to meet the BS
requirements, the conformance tests may be performed on a system comprising
the BS together with these elements, supplied separately for the purposes of
testing. In this case, it must be demonstrated that the performance of the
configuration under test is representative of the system in normal operation,
and the conformance assessment is only applicable when the BS is used with the
antenna system.
For conformance testing of such a BS, the following procedure may be used.
#### 4.10.7.1 Receiver tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna connectors
shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals the
power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.10.7.1-1.
Figure 4.10.7.1-1: Receiver test set-up
For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may be
performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.
#### 4.10.7.2 Transmitter tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the transmitter antenna connectors
(Pi) shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals
the power of the test signal(s) (Ps) specified in the test. This may be
assessed by separately measuring the signals emitted by each antenna connector
and summing the results, or by combining the signals and performing a single
measurement. The characteristics (e.g. amplitude and phase) of the combining
network should be such that the power of the combined signal is maximised.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.10.7.2-1.
Figure 4.10.7.2-1: Transmitter test set-up
For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately for each
transmitter antenna connector.
## 4.11 Format and interpretation of tests
Each test in the following clauses has a standard format:
**X Title**
All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the present
document, unless otherwise stated.
**X.1 Definition and applicability**
This subclause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all equipment or
only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer declarations may be included
here.
**X.2 Minimum requirement**
This subclause contains the reference to the subclause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.
**X.3 Test purpose**
This subclause defines the purpose of the test.
**X.4 Method of test**
**X.4.1 Initial conditions**
This subclause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-
up. For the test of certain RF requirements the present specification refers
to the test method of the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the initial
conditions as defined within the referred test specification for the RF
requirement shall be used.
**X.4.2 Procedure**
This subclause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and provides
further details of the test definition like point of access (e.g. test port),
domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and
algorithms (e.g. averaging). For the test of certain RF requirements the
present specification refers to the test method of the single-RAT
specifications. In this case, the test procedure as defined within the
referred test specification for the RF requirement shall be used.
**X.5 Test requirement**
This subclause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test.
See subclause 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results. For the test of
certain RF requirements the present specification refers to the requirements
of the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the test requirement as
defined within the referred test specification for the RF requirement shall be
used.
## 4.12 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For some
requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or exclusions to
the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band operation. In the case of
multiband operation of a BS, single-RAT operation and the corresponding
applicability of the requirements for each operating band is determined based
on the RAT configuration within only that operating band, unless otherwise
stated.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band
or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more antenna port(s) in
different ways are possible. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, operating band unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to each antenna connector.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to the antenna connector configured for single-band operation and
no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-
band requirements are tested separately at the antenna connector configured
for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation supporting BC3 bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume synchronized operation, where
no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.
The RF requirements in the present specification are FFS for multi-band
operation supporting bands for both FDD and TDD.
# 5 Applicability of requirements and test configurations
The present clause defines for each RF test requirement the set of mandatory
test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating conformance. This is
specified in the Table 5.2-1 for single-RAT Multi-carrier, Table 5.1-1, Table
5.1-1a and Table 5.1-1b for multi-RAT Base Stations and Table 5.3-1 for multi-
band capable Base Station.
Requirements apply according to the declared RAT Capability Set (CS) within
each supported operating band of the MSR Base Station and the Band Category of
the declared operating band (BC1, BC2 or BC3), as listed in the heading of
each table. Some RF requirements listed in the tables may not be mandatory or
they may apply only regionally. This is further specified for each requirement
in clause 6 and 7, and in Table 4.3-1.
For a declared RAT Capability Set (CS) in Table 5.1-1, 5.1-1a, 5.1-1b and
5.2-1, only the requirements listed in the column for that CS apply.
Requirements listed under CS other than the declared CS(s) need not be tested.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous operation only, the test
configuration(s) in Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 denoted by a "C" and entries that
refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous operation and
where the parameters in the manufacture's declaration according to subclause
4.7.2 are identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation (within
subgroup in case of CS7), the test configuration(s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1
denoted by "CNC" and entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall be
used.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous operation and
where the parameters in the manufacture's declaration according to subclause
4.7.2 are not identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation (within
subgroup in case of CS7), the test configuration(s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1
denoted by "C/NC" and entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall be
used for testing.
For a BS declared to support NB-IoT operating in-band, the test
configuration(s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 denoted by "NI" and entries that
refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.
For a BS declared to support NB-IoT operating in guard band, the test
configuration(s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 denoted by "NG" and entries that
refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.
For a BS declared to support NB-IoT operating in guard band and in-band, the
test configuration(s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 denoted by "NG" or/and "NI" and
entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.
For a BS declared to support NB-IoT standalone, the test configuration(s) in
Table 5.1-1a, 5.1-1b and 5.2-1 and entries that refer to single-RAT
specifications shall be used for testing.
For some of the RF test requirements entries within Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1
refer to the single-RAT specifications; this is denoted by \"(TS 25.141)\",
\"(TS 25.142)\", \"(TS 36.141)\" or \"(TS 51.021)\". In this case the
following shall apply:
\- transmitter test signals and test models as defined within the referred
test specification shall be used, see clause 4.9.2. For some RF requirements
this comprises a mandatory test case in addition to a test case using the MSR
test configurations defined in clause 4.8.
\- for some RF requirements the initial conditions and test procedure as
defined within the referred single-RAT test specification for the RF
requirement shall be used. This is specified in further detail in clauses 6, 7
and 8 of the present document.
\- for some RF requirements the test requirement as defined within the
referred single-RAT test specification for the RF requirement shall be used.
This is specified in further detail in clauses 6, 7 and 8 of the present
document. In this case (see clause 4.1):
\- The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
are defined in the respective referred test specification
\- Test Tolerances are defined in the respective referred test specification.
\- If the parameters in the manufacturer's declarations according to subclause
4.7.2 are not identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation, the
parameters for contiguous operation shall be used for the test in the single
RAT test specification.
For a BS declared to be capable of multi-band operation, the applicability of
the requirement for each operating band is determined by the RAT configuration
within that operating band as identified in Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1, unless
otherwise stated. The testing of multi-band capable BS shall be according to
Table 5.3-1 as follows:
\- For requirements test denoted by SBT (Single Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 shall be used for each operating
band depending on the RAT configuration within that band.
\- For requirements test denoted by MBT (Multi-Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in Table 5.3-1 shall be used depending on the Band Category
of the declared operating band combination.

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. BS
configurations for the tests are defined in subclause 4.10.
Unless otherwise stated, a BS declared to be capable of E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-
band or guard band operations (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA) is
only required to pass the transmitter tests for E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-band or
guard band (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA); it is not required to
perform the transmitter tests again for E-UTRA only (or any combination with
GSM and/or UTRA).
Unless otherwise stated, a BS declared to be capable of E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-
band and guard band operations (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA) needs
only to pass the transmitter tests for E-UTRA with guard band operation (or
any combination with GSM and/or UTRA).
## 6.2 Base Station output power
### 6.2.1 Base Station maximum output power
#### 6.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
Output power of the Base Station is the mean power delivered to a load with
resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the transmitter.
The maximum total output power, P~max~, of the Base Station is the mean power
level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period in a
specified reference condition.
The maximum RAT output power, P~max,RAT~, of the Base Station is the mean
power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
for a specific RAT in a specified reference condition.
The maximum carrier output power, P~max,c~ of the Base Station is the mean
power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
for a specific carrier in a specified reference condition.
The rated carrier output power, P~Rated,c~, of the base station is the mean
power level for a specific carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be
available at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.
In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply
also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal test
environment in Annex B.
The rated carrier output power of the BS shall be as specified in Table 6.2-1.
Table 6.2-1: Base Station rated carrier output power
* * *
BS class P~Rated,c~ Wide Area BS (note) Medium Range BS ≤+ 38 dBm Local Area
BS ≤+ 24 dBm NOTE: There is no upper limit for the rated carrier output power
of the Wide Area Base Station.
* * *
#### 6.2.1.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 6.2.1.
#### 6.2.1.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the accuracy of the maximum carrier output power
across the frequency range and under normal and extreme conditions for all
transmitters in the BS.
#### 6.2.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~
in single-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1; B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and
B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
In addition, a single test shall be performed under extreme power supply
conditions as defined in Annex B.5. In this case, it is sufficient to test on
a single combination of one ARFCN, UARFCN or E-ARFCN, one Base Station RF
Bandwidth position and with only one applicable test configuration defined in
clause 5.

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or
under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by
local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the
present document is given in subclause 4.4.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, etc.) as listed below. The power of any spurious emission shall not
exceed the limits of Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 for a BS where requirements for co-
existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of
multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of
Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.5.5-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in
Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in Table
6.6.1.5.5-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside
the downlink operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). Emission limits for
this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table 4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not
deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-
existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA
Band 12 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz
below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and
10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating
band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

##### 6.6.1.5.6 Co-location with other Base Stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.1.5.6-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed
in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For
BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note
column of Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS
capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate
antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the
co-location requirements in Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
downlink operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). The current state-of-
the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location
with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling
loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used.
These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [14].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table
4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the
same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized Base Stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
### 6.6.2 Operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Operating band unwanted emission limits are defined from 10 MHz below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating band to the lower Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to 10 MHz above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink operating band. In addition, for
a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block
gap. In addition, for a BS operating in multiple bands, it applies inside any
Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification,
except for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation. The
requirements in TS 45.005 [6] as defined in subclause 6.6.2.3 apply to an MSR
Base Station for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in Band
Category 2.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter RF Bandwidth gap are
not applicable.
#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 6.6.2.1, 6.6.2.2,
6.6.2.3 and 6.6.2.4.
#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions of the MSR BS, close to the assigned channel
bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.

## 7.5 Out-of-band blocking
### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability
The Out-of-band blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an
unwanted interferer outside the uplink operating band.
The blocking performance requirement applies as specified in the Table
7.5.5.1-1 and Table 7.5.5.2-1.
Unless otherwise stated, a BS declared to be capable of E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-
band and guard band operations (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA) is
only required to pass the out-of-band blocking tests for E-UTRA with guard
band operation (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA). It's not required to
perform the out-of-band blocking receiver tests again for E-UTRA with in-band
operation (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA).
### 7.5.2 Minimum requirement
The general minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 7.5.1. The co-
location minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 7.5.2.
### 7.5.3 Test purpose
The test stresses the ability of the BS receiver to withstand high-level
interference from unwanted signals at specified frequency bands, without undue
degradation of its sensitivity.
### 7.5.4 Method of test
#### 7.5.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: M~RFBW~ in single-band
operation, see subclause 4.9.1, B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in
multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
In addition, in multi-band operation:
\- For B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing above the highest
operating band may be omitted
\- For B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing below the lowest
operating band may be omitted
1) Set up the equipment as shown in Annex D.2.1.
2) Generate the wanted signal according to the applicable test configuration
(see clause 5) using reference measurement channel to the BS under test as
follows:
\- For E-UTRA see Annex A.1 in TS 36.141 [9].
\- For UTRA FDD see Annex A.2 in TS 25.141 [10].
\- For UTRA TDD see Annex A.2.1 in TS 25.142 [12].
\- For GSM see subclause 7.6.2 in TS 51.021 [11] and Annex P in TS 45.005 [6]
for reference channels to test.
\- For NB-IoT see Annex A.14 in TS 36.141 [9].
#### 7.5.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the BS to transmit with the carrier set-up and power allocation
according to the applicable test configuration(s) (see clause 5).
The transmitter may be turned off for the out-of-band blocker tests when the
frequency of the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall inside the
bandwidth of the wanted signal.
2) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals, levels and
the frequency offsets as specified for general test requirements in Table
7.5.5.1-1 and, when applicable, for co-location test requirements in Table
7.5.5.2-1.
3) The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz within
the specified range.
4) Measure the performance of the wanted signal at the BS receiver, as defined
in the subclause 7.5.5, for the relevant carriers specified by the test
configuration in subclause 4.8.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connectors, the
following steps shall apply:
5) For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where
single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier
activated in the other band.
6) For multi-band tests, the interfering signal shall first be applied on the
same port as the wanted signal. The test shall be repeated with the
interfering signal applied on the other port (if any) mapped to the same
receiver as the wanted signal. Any antenna connector with no signal applied
shall be terminated.
7) Repeat step 6 with the wanted signal for the other band(s) applied on the
respective port(s).

#### 7.5.5.2 Co-location test requirements
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of BS
receivers when E-UTRA BS, UTRA, CDMA or GSM/EDGE operating in a different
frequency band are co-located with a BS.
The requirements in this subclause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between the
interfering transmitter and the BS receiver and are based on co-location with
base stations of the same class.
For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
parameters in Table 7.5.5.2-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
[5], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [3], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [4], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS
45.005 [6], Annex P.2.1.
\- For any measured NB-IoT carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
[5], subclause 7.2.

## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna connector. The
requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX antenna ports. In this
case for FDD BS the test shall be performed when both TX and RX are on, with
the TX port terminated.
For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the
transmitter spurious emission limits as specified in subclause 6.6.1 are
valid.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band supported
on each antenna connector.
Unless otherwise stated, a BS declared to be capable of E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-
band and guard band operations (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA) is
only required to pass the receiver spurious emissions tests for E-UTRA with
guard band operation (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA). It's not
required to perform the receiver spurious emissions tests again for E-UTRA
with in-band operation (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA).
### 7.6.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 7.6.1.
### 7.6.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to limit the interference
caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.
### 7.6.4 Method of test
#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: M~RFBW~ in single-band
operation, see subclause 4.9.1, B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in
multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
1) Set up the equipment as shown in Annex D.2.1.
#### 7.6.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the measurement equipment parameters as specified in Table 7.6.5.1-1.
For BC2, the parameters in Table 7.6.5.2-1 apply in addition.
2) Set the BS to transmit with the carrier set-up and power allocation
according to the applicable test configuration(s) (see clause 5).
3) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described in
subclause 7.6.5.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
4) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
### 7.6.5 Test requirements
#### 7.6.5.1 General test requirements
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table
7.6.5.1-1.
Table 7.6.5.1-1: General spurious emission test requirement
* * *
Frequency range Maximum level Measurement Bandwidth Note 30 MHz ‑ 1 GHz -57
dBm 100 kHz  
1 GHz ‑ 12.75 GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz  
12.75 GHz - 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the UL operating
band in GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz Applies only for Bands 22, 42 and 43. NOTE: The
frequency range from F~BW\ RF,DL,low~ -10 MHz to F~BW\ RF,_,DLhigh~ + 10 MHz
may be excluded from the requirement. For BS capable of multi-band operation,
the exclusion applies for all supported operating bands. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the excluded frequency
range is only applicable for the operating band supported on each antenna
connector.
* * *
In addition to the requirements in Table 7.6.5.1-1, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the additional spurious emissions requirements in
subclause 6.6.1.5.5 and in case of FDD BS (for BC1 and BC2) emission shall not
exceed the levels specified for protection of the BS receivers of own or
different BS in subclause 6.6.1.5.4. In addition, the requirements for co-
location with other Base Stations specified in subclause 6.6.1.5.6 may also be
applied.
#### 7.6.5.2 Additional test requirement for BC2 (Category B)
For a BS operating in Band Category 2 when GSM/EDGE is configured and where
Category B spurious emissions apply, the power of any spurious emissions shall
not exceed the limits in Table 7.6.5.2-1.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the limits in Table 7.6.5.2-1 are only
applicable when all supported operating bands belong to BC2 and GSM/EDGE is
configured in all bands.

## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation
### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal.
Unless otherwise stated, a BS declared to be capable of E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-
band and guard band operations (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA) is
only required to pass the receiver intermodulation tests for E-UTRA with guard
band operation (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA). It's not required to
perform the receiver intermodulation tests again for E-UTRA with in-band
operation (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA).
### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2], subclauses 7.7.1, 7.7.2 and
7.7.3.
### 7.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to inhibit the
generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements caused by
the presence of two high-level interfering signals at frequencies with a
specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted signal.
### 7.7.4 Method of test

following steps shall apply:
3) For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where
single band test configurations shall apply with no carrier activated in the
other band.
4) For multi-band tests, the interfering signal shall first be applied on the
same port as the wanted signal. The test shall be repeated with the
interfering signal applied on the other port (if any) mapped to the same
receiver as the wanted signal. Any antenna connector with no signal applied
shall be terminated.
5) Repeat step 6 with the wanted signal for the other band(s) applied on the
respective port(s).

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the gap size is at least as wide as
the E-UTRA interfering signal in Table 7.7.5.2-2. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Test Tolerances and Derivation of test
requirements
The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification
using the Test Tolerances defined here. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the
test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the Test
Tolerance is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum
requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the
following tables.
Test requirements which are included by reference to TS 25.141 [10], TS
25.142[12], TS 36.141[9] or TS 51.021[11] have been calculated within the
referred test specification using the Test Tolerances defined therein.
The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test
Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.
The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where
the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in subclause 4.1.2.
In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test
tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as
defined in this Annex.
Unless otherwise stated, the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2 apply to the
Test System for testing E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/EDGE and NB-IoT MSR BS.
