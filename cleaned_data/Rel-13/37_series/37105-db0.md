# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between the AAS BS specification and non‑AAS BS single RAT
& MSR specifications
An AAS BS is distinguished from a _non-AAS BS_ by including a dedicated
antenna system in its design.
The transceiver to antenna RF interface of the AAS BS (referred to as the
_transceiver array boundary_) comprises one or several _TAB connectors_. There
is no general one-to-one relationship between _non-AAS BS_ antenna connectors
and AAS BS _TAB connectors_ , but it can be expected the number of _TAB
connectors_ in AAS BS will be greater than or equal to the number of _non-AAS
BS_ antenna connectors for respective base stations with corresponding
functionality.
For the conducted requirements, the AAS BS requirements are formulated in such
a way that the impact of what they are meant to regulate is expected to be
\"equivalent\" to the corresponding _non-AAS BS_ requirements; i.e. the
outside world sees the same level of emissions, power levels, or can expect
the same demodulation performance at the UE from the AAS BS as it would from a
_non-AAS BS_ with equivalent functionality. All _non-AAS BS_ RF requirements
(referenced to the _non-AAS BS_ antenna connector) have been adapted to AAS BS
conducted requirements. Many requirements are also direct references to the
_non-AAS_ BS RF specifications 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3], 3GPP TS
36.104 [4] and 3GPP TS 37.104 [5].
NOTE 1: Applying _non-AAS BS_ antenna connector requirements directly to
individual _TAB connectors_ renders certain AAS BS requirements excessively
strict from a system perspective.
NOTE 2: Both specific references and non-specific references occur.
In addition, a new set of requirements referred to as radiated requirements or
OTA requirements is introduced in subclauses 9 and 10 for transmitter and
receiver, respectively. These requirements have no corresponding _non-AAS BS_
requirements.
In this specification, the term \"requirements for _single RAT operation_ \"
refers to requirements that are derived from the 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS
25.105 [3], or 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] specifications baseline, whilst
\"requirements for _MSR operation_ \" refers to requirements derived from the
3GPP TS 37.104 [5] specification baseline.
NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation is not
supported by AAS BS. When referring to standalone E-UTRA requirements for
_single RAT operation_ in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] or to E-UTRA requirements for
_MSR operation_ in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5], any requirements specified in those
specifications for E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band or guard band) or for
standalone NB-IoT, shall not be considered for the AAS BS. Unless otherwise
stated, the exclusion of the NB-IoT requirements in this specification applies
to all operation modes (i.e. _in-band NB-IoT operation_ , _guard band NB-IoT
operation_ and _standalone NB-IoT operation_).
Band 46 operation is not supported by AAS BS. When referring to standalone
E-UTRA requirements for _single RAT operation_ in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] or to
E-UTRA requirements for _MSR operation_ in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5], any
requiremetns specified in those specifications for Band 46 operation shall not
be considered for the AAS BS with E‑UTRA.
## 4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the
test requirements specified in the conformance specifications TS 37.145-1 [26]
and TS 37.145-2 [27].
The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 37.145-1 [26] and TS
37.145-2 [27] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum
requirements in this specification to create test requirements. For some
requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to
zero.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle. The shared risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITU‑R M.1545
[11].
## 4.3 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
AAS BS requirements are defined for two points of reference, signified by
radiated requirements and conducted requirements.
{width="6.304166666666666in" height="3.061111111111111in"}
Figure 4.3-1: Radiated and conducted points of reference of AAS BS
Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA) with a point of
reference in the far field (Fraunhofer) region. Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) directions in which the OTA
requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.
Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of _TAB
connectors_ at the _transceiver array boundary_ , which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.
The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver functionality
generating modulated transmit signal structures and performing receiver
combining and demodulation.
The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver units.
Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into transceiver units.
The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to transmit/receive parallel
independent modulated symbol streams.
The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the RF
power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array, and/or
distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to the
transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.
How a conducted requirement is applied to the _transceiver array boundary_ is
detailed in the respective requirement sub‑clause.
## 4.4 Base station classes for AAS BS
The requirements in the present document apply to AAS BS of Wide Area BS,
Medium Range BS and Local Area BS classes unless otherwise stated.
Wide Area BS are characterized by requirements derived from Macro Cell
scenarios. For _AAS BS_ of Wide Area BS class, the minimum coupling loss
between any _TAB connector_ and the UE is 70 dB.
NOTE: Whenever WA BS is referred in this specification, the NB-IoT Wide Area
BS and related requiremetns as defined in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4], are not
applicable for AAS BS.
Medium Range BS are characterized by requirements derived from Micro Cell
scenarios. For _AAS BS_ of Medium Range BS class, the minimum coupling loss
between any _TAB connector_ and the UE is 53 dB.
Local Area BS are characterized by requirements derived from Pico Cell
scenarios. For _AAS BS_ of Local Area BS class, the minimum coupling loss
between any _TAB connector_ and the UE is 45 dB.
## 4.5 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements set by local and
regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances the regional requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may be
applied differently in different regions. _Non‑AAS BS_ requirements are
applicable as defined in the present document. In many cases, such
requirements include regional requirements that are implicitly referenced from
the present specification, and listed in the specification for the
specifications concerned 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3], 3GPP TS
36.104 [4] and 3GPP TS 37.104 [5].

## 4.6 Operating Bands and Band Categories
The operating bands and _band categories_ for AAS BS are the same as for _non-
AAS BS_ , as described in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5].
NOTE 1: AAS BS does not support GSM, but BC2 is still applicable for
protection of and against GSM operation in BC2 operating bands.
NOTE 2: AAS BS does not support Band 46 (and all its sub-bands defined in 3GPP
TS 36.104 [8], subclause 5.5) operation, but Band 46 requirements are still
applicable for AAS BS for protection of and against Band 46 operation.
## 4.7 Channel arrangements
The channel arrangements for AAS BS are the same as those for UTRA _non-AAS
BS_ and E-UTRA _non-AAS BS_ as described in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5].
NOTE: Requirements for nominal carrier spacing of 19.8 MHz and 20.1 MHz for
carriers in Band 46 as specified in 36.104 [8] subclause 5.7.1, are not
applicable for AAS BS.
## 4.8 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where an AAS BS operates can be either contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for AAS BS configured for both _contiguous spectrum_
operation and _non-contiguous spectrum_ operation.
For AAS BS operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , some requirements apply
both at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and inside the _sub-block gaps_.
For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and the _sub-block_ edges respectively.
## 4.9 Requirements for AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating
bands
For AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating bands, the RF
requirements in clause 6, 7, 9, and 10 apply separately to each supported
operating band unless otherwise stated.
An AAS BS may be capable of supporting operation in multiple operating bands
with one of the following implementations of _TAB connectors_ in the
_transceiver array boundary_ :
\- All _TAB connectors_ are _single band TAB connectors_.
\- Different sets of _single band TAB connectors_ support different operating
bands, but each _TAB connector_ supports only operation in one single
operating band.
\- Sets of _single band TAB connectors_ support operation in multiple
operating bands with some _single band TAB connectors_ supporting more than
one operating band.
\- All _TAB connectors_ are multiband _TAB connectors_.
\- A combination of single band sets and multi-band sets of _TAB connectors_
provides support of the AAS BS capability of operation in multiple operating
bands.
Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an operating band apply
only to the set of _TAB connectors_ supporting that operating band.
In certain requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or
exclusions to the requirement apply at _multi-band TAB connectors_ as detailed
in the requirement subclause.
In the case of an operating band being supported only by _single band TAB
connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min
cell group_ , _single band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB
connectors_.
NOTE: Each supported operating band needs to be operated separately during
conformance testing on _single band TAB connectors_.
In the case of an operating band being supported only by _multi-band TAB
connector_ s supporting the same operating band combination in a _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ , _multi-
band requirements_ apply to that set of _TAB connectors_.
The case of an operating band being supported by both _multi-band TAB
connectors_ and _single band TAB connectors_ in a _TAB connector TX min cell
group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ is not covered by the present
release of this specification.
The case of an operating band being supported by _multi-band TAB connectors_
which are not all supporting the same operating band combination in a _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ or a _TAB connector RX min cell group_ is not
covered by the present release of this specification.
For _multi-band TAB connectors_ supporting the bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink and
downlink occur between the bands.
The RF requirements for _multi-band TAB connectors_ supporting bands for both
FDD and TDD are not covered by the present release of this specification.
# 5 Applicability of Requirements
## 5.1 General
The applicability of requirements is related to the band categories described
in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5]. This clause captures the requirement clauses\'
applicability for the respective band categories depending on the operating
band specific BS RAT/MSR capability. For each individual band, the
manufacturer declares whether the AAS BS conforms to MSR or single RAT
requirements.
In the present specification, requirements for _MSR operation_ and for _single
RAT operation_ are defined. If the AAS BS is declared to be single RAT in an
operating band, the respective requirements for _single RAT operation_
(derived from 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3] or 3GPP TS 36.104 [4])
apply in that operating band. If the AAS BS is declared to be MSR (operating
one or more RATs) in the operating band, the requirements for _MSR operation_
(derived from 3GPP TS 35.104 [5]) apply to that operating band. Where
requirements for _MSR operation_ comprise RAT specific requirements, these
apply only when the AAS BS is operating the RAT in the operating band.
NOTE: An AAS BS declared MSR in an operating band and operating only one RAT
is differentiated from an AAS BS declared single RAT in the operating band by
the fact that requirements are derived from 3GPP TS 37.104 [5] rather than
from the single RAT specifications 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3] or
3GPP TS 36.104 [4].
## 5.2 Band category 1 (BC1) and band category 2 (BC2)
The RF requirements listed in table 5.2-1 apply to AAS BS for each supported
operating band belonging to BC1 and BC2. Requirements apply according to the
RAT/MSR capability of the AAS BS in the operating band, as listed in the
heading of the table. Some requirements listed in the table may not be
mandatory or they may apply only regionally. This is further specified in the
subclause treating each requirement and in table 4.5-1.
NOTE: Bands in BC1 and BC2 categories are also used for NB-IoT operation. NB-
IoT is not applicable for AAS BS.
For operation in multiple operating bands, the applicability of the
requirements in table 5.2-1 is determined based on the manufacturer declared
AAS BS RAT and single RAT/MSR conformance for each operating band. The
applicability of _multi-band requirements_ respective _single band
requirements_ is defined in clause 4.9 and in each referred clause in the
table but it cannot be determined by the table itself.

## 5.3 Band category 3 (BC3)
The RF requirements listed in table 5.3-1 apply to AAS BS for each supported
operating band belonging to BC3. Requirements apply according to the RAT/MSR
capability of the AAS BS in the operating band, as listed in the heading of
the table. Some requirements listed in the table may not be mandatory or they
may apply only regionally. This is further specified in the clause of each
requirement and in table 4.5-1.
For operation in multiple operating bands, the applicability of the
requirements in table 5.3-1 is determined based on the manufacturer declared
AAS BS RAT and single RAT/MSR conformance for each operating band. The
applicability of _multi-band requirements_ respective _single band
requirements_ is defined in clause 4.9 and in each referred clause in the
table but it cannot be determined by the table itself.

# 6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified with a
full complement of transceiver units for the configuration in normal operating
conditions.
_The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported geographical
cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of supported geographical
cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting with the minimum amount of cell
splitting supported with transmission on all TAB connectors supporting the
operating band. The manufacturer shall also declare TAB connector TX min cell
groups._ Every _TAB connector_ supporting transmission in an operating band
shall map to one _TAB connector_ _TX min cell group_ supporting the same
operating band _. The mapping of TAB connectors to cells is implementation
dependent._
_The number of active transmitter units that are considered when calculating
the emissions limit (N~TXU,\ counted~) for an AAS BS is calculated as
follows:_
N~TXU,\ counted~ = _min(N~TXU,active~ , 8×N~cells~)_ for AAS BS in _single RAT
E-UTRA operation_ and MSR AAS BS (except UTRA only MSR AAS BS)
_and_
N~TXU,\ counted~ = _min(N~TXU,active~, 4×N~cells~)_ for AAS BS in _single RAT
UTRA operation_ and UTRA only MSR AAS BS
_Further:_
N~TXU,countedpercell~ = _N~TXU,counted~ / N~cells~_
N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the _basic limits_ as described in
subclause 6.6.
NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of _active transmitter unit_
s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.
Any transmitter requirement specified for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard band,
or standalone NB-IoT operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] for E-UTRA with NB-IoT
(in-band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, or in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5] for
E-UTRA with NB-IoT or standalone NB-IoT in _MSR operation_ , and referred in
clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS.
Any transmitter requirement specified for Band 46 operation in 3GPP TS 36.104
[4] for E-UTRA, or in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5] for E-UTRA in _MSR operation_ , and
referred in clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS.

Primary CCPCH power is the _code domain power_ of the primary common control
physical channel averaged over the transmit timeslot and summed over the _TAB
connectors_ transmitting the PCCPCH for a cell. Primary CCPCH power is
signalled over the BCH.
The differential accuracy of the Primary CCPCH power is the relative
transmitted power accuracy of PCCPCH in consecutive frames when the nominal
PCCPCH power is not changed.

function of the output power from the _TAB connector_ group transmitting
PCCPCH averaged over the transmit timeslot, Pout, and the manufacturer\'s
rated total power of the group, P~rated,t,group~.

## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
### 6.7.1 General
The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna array. The requirement
applies during the _transmitter ON period_ and the _transmitter transient
period_.
The requirement applies at each _TAB connector_ supporting transmission in the
operating band.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an interfering signal is injected into the _TAB connector_.
For AAS BS there are two types of transmitter intermodulation cases captured
by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:
1) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
from a co-located base station.
2) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
from other transmitter units within the AAS BS.
For AAS BS, the co-location transmitter intermodulation requirement is
considered sufficient if the interfering signal for the co-location
requirement is higher than the declared interfering signal for intra-system
transmitter intermodulation requirement.
### 6.7.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation
#### 6.7.2.1 General co-location minimum requirement
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission
limits specified for transmitter spurious emission in subclause 6.6.6,
operating band unwanted emission in subclause 6.6.5 and ACLR in subclause
6.6.3 in the presence of a wanted signal and an interfering signal according
to table 6.7.2.1‑1 for AAS BS operation in BC1, BC2 and BC3.
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth edges_.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ _edges_ or _Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For _TAB connectors_ supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the
requirement is also applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ for interfering signal
offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the _sub-block
gap_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _sub-block_
edges.
For _TAB connectors_ supporting operation in multiple operating bands, the
requirement applies relative to the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ of
each operating band. In case the inter _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap is less
than 15 MHz, the requirement in the gap applies only for interfering signal
offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the inter _Base
Station RF Bandwidth_ gap.

In case that none of the | | | interfering signal positions | | | fall completely within the | | | frequency range of the _downlink | | | operating band_ , 3GPP TS 37.141 | | | [19] provides further guidance | | | regarding appropriate test | | | requirements. | | | | | | NOTE 2: In certain regions, note | | | 1 is not applied in Band 1, 3, | | | 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 28, 32 | | | operating within 1 475.9 MHz to | | | 1 495.9 MHz, 34. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

or BC2, the requirement is also applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ with a gap
size larger than or equal to two times the interfering signal centre frequency
offset. For _TAB connectors_ supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_
in BC1, the requirement is not applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ with a gap
size equal to or larger than 5 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the _sub-block_ edges.
For _TAB connectors_ supporting operation in multiple operating bands, the
requirement applies relative to the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ of a
BC2 operating band. The requirement is also applicable for BC1 and BC2 inside
an inter _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap equal to or larger than two times the
interfering signal centre frequency offset. For _TAB connectors_ supporting
operation in multiple operating bands, the requirement is not applicable for
BC1 band inside an inter _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap with a gap size equal

# 7 Conducted receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at the AAS
BS _TAB connector_ with full complement of transceivers for the configuration
in normal operating condition. For FDD operation the requirements in clause 7
shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) on.
NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is configured to
transmit and receive at the same time.
NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is configured to
TX OFF power during _receive period_.
The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported geographical
cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of supported geographical
cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting with minimum amount of cell
splitting. The manufacturer shall also declare _TAB connector RX min cell
groups for this minimum number of cells configuration_. Every _TAB connector_
supporting reception in an operating band shall map to one _TAB connector_ RX
min cell group supporting the same. The mapping of _TAB connectors_ to cells
is implementation dependent.
The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating the
emission limit (N~RXU,counted~) for an AAS BS is calculated as follows:
N~RXU,counted~ = _min(N~RXU,active~, 8_ _× N~cells~)_ for AAS BS in _single
RAT E-UTRA operation_ and MSR AAS BS (excluding UTRA only MSR AAS BS).
And
N~RXU,counted~ = _min(N~RXU,\ active~, 4_ _×_ _N~cells~)_ for AAS BS in
_single RAT UTRA operation_ and UTRA only MSR AAS BS.
Further:
N~RXU,countedpercell~ = _N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~_
N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the _basic limits_ as described in
subclause 7.6.
NOTE 3: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units and is
independent to the declaration of N~cells~.
Any receiver requirement specified for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard band, or
standalone NB-IoT operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] for E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-
band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, or in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5] for
E-UTRA with NB-IoT or standalone NB-IoT in _MSR operation_ , and referred in
clause 7, is not applicable for AAS BS.
Any receiver requirement specified for Band 46 operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4]
for E-UTRA, or in 3GPP TS 37.104 [5] for E-UTRA in _MSR operation_ , and
referred in clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS. The requirements for co-

_Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
_Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ or _Radio Bandwidth_ edges applicable to
each _TAB connector_.
For _TAB connector_ supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the
requirement applies in addition inside any _sub-block gap_ , in case the _sub-
block gap_ size is at least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined

#### 7.5.2.2 Co-location minimum requirement
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of _AAS
BS receivers_ when E-UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS or GSM/EDGE BS operating in a
different frequency band are co-located with an AAS BS.
The requirements in this subclause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between the
interfering transmitter and the _AAS BS receiver_ and are based on co-location
with base stations of the same class.
For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the _TAB connector_ using
the parameters in table 7.5.2.2-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the _maximum
throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 36.104
[8], subclause 7.2.1.
\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6], subclause 7.2.1.
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 [7], subclause 7.2.1.2.

## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
### 7.6.1 General
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the _TAB connector_. The
requirements apply to all AAS BS with separate RX and TX _TAB connectors_.
NOTE: In this case for FDD AAS BS the test is performed when both TX and RX
are ON, with the TX _TAB connector_ terminated.
For a _TAB connector_ supporting both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements apply
during the _transmitter OFF period_. For a _TAB connector_ supporting both RX
and TX in FDD, the receiver spurious requirements are superseded by the TX
spurious requirements in subclause 6.6.6.
For RX only _multi-band TAB connector(s)_ , the RX spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported operating band.
For _multi-band TAB connector(s)_ that both transmit and receive in operating
band supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are applicable during
the TX OFF period, and are subject to exclusion zones in each supported
operating band. _The unwanted emission level limit of a TAB connector RX min
cell group is in general defined by the unwanted emission basic limit which is
the same as the corresponding applicable non-AAS BS per transmitter
requirement specified in_ 3GPP TS 25.104 [2], 3GPP TS 25.105 [3], 3GPP TS
36.104 [4] or 3GPP TS 37.104 [5]_, and its scaling by_ N~RXU,countedpercell~.
The _basic limits_ and corresponding scaling are defined in each relevant
subclause. The receiver spurious emission requirements are applied per the
_TAB connector RX min cell groups for all the configurations supported by the
AAS BS._
### 7.6.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation
#### 7.6.2.1 General minimum requirement
The general MSR RX spurious emission _basic limit_ s are provided in table
7.6.2.1-1.
Table 7.6.2.1-1: General spurious emissions _basic limits_
Frequency range Maximum level Measurement bandwidth Note
* * *
30MHz ‑ 1 GHz -57 dBm 100 kHz  
1 GHz - 12.75 GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz  
12.75 GHz - 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the UL operating
band in GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz Applies only for Bands 22, 42 and 43. NOTE: The
frequency range from F~BW\ RF,DL,low~ -10 MHz to F~BW\ RF,\ DL,high~ + 10 MHz
may be excluded from the requirement. For _multi-band TAB connectors_ , the
exclusion applies for all supported operating bands for those connectors.
The RX spurious emissions requirements for an MSR AAS BS are that for each
applicable _basic limit_ specified in table 7.6.2.1-1 for each _TAB connector
RX min cell group,_ the power sum of emissions at the _TAB connectors_ of the
_TAB connector RX min cell group_ shall not exceed an AAS BS limit specified
as the _basic limit_ \+ X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless
stated differently in regional regulation.
In addition to the _basic limit_ s in Table 7.6.2.1-1, additional spurious
emissions requirements in 3GPP TS 37.104 [9], subclause 6.6.1.3 form _basic
limit_ s for additional receiver spurious emission requirements.
In case of FDD BS (for BC1 and BC2), the levels specified for Protection of
the BS receivers of own or different BS in 3GPP TS 37.104 [9], subclause
6.6.1.2 form basic levels for additional receiver spurious emission
requirements.
In addition, the requirements for co-location with other base stations
specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 [9], subclause 6.6.1.4 may also form basic levels
for co-location spurious emission requirements.
NOTE: Conformance to the _AAS BS receiver_ spurious emissions requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:
> 1) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each _TAB connector_
> in the _TAB connector RX min cell group_ shall be less than or equal to the
> AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective frequency span.
>
> Or
>
> 2) The spurious emissions power at each _TAB connector_ shall be less than
> or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective frequency
> span, scaled by -10log~10~(_n_), where _n_ is the number of _TAB connectors_
> in the _TAB connector RX min cell group_.
### 7.6.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation
The single RAT UTRA FDD wide area, medium range area and local area RX
spurious emissions _basic limit_ s are the same as those specified in 3GPP TS
25.104 [6], subclause 7.7.1.
The single RAT UTRA TDD wide area and local area RX spurious emissions _basic
limit_ s are the same as those specified in 3GPP TS 25.105 [7], subclause
7.7.1.2.
The RX spurious emissions requirements for a single RAT UTRA AAS BS are that
for each applicable _basic limit_ as specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6] or 3GPP
TS 25.105 [7], for each _TAB connector RX min cell group,_ the power sum of
emissions at the _TAB connectors_ of the _TAB connector RX min cell group_
shall not exceed an AAS BS limit specified as the _basic limit_ \+ X, where X
= 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.
NOTE: Conformance to the _AAS BS receiver_ spurious emissions requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:
> 1) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each _TAB connector_
> in the _TAB connector RX min cell group_ shall be less than or equal to the
> AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective frequency span.

> or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective frequency
> span, scaled by -10log~10~(_n_), where _n_ is the number of _TAB connectors_
> in the _TAB connector RX min cell group_.
### 7.6.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation
The single RAT E-UTRA wide area, medium range area and local area RX spurious
emissions _basic limit_ s are the same as those specified in 3GPP TS 36.104
[8], subclause 7.7.1.
The RX spurious emissions requirements for a single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS are that
for each applicable _basic limit_ specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] for each
_TAB connector RX min cell group_ , the power sum of emissions at the _TAB
connectors_ of the _TAB connector RX min cell group_ shall not exceed an AAS
limit specified as the _basic limit_ \+ X, where X =
10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.
NOTE: Conformance to the _AAS BS receiver_ spurious emissions requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:
> 1) The sum of the emissions power measured on each _TAB connector_ in the
> _TAB connector RX min cell group_ shall be less than or equal to the AAS BS
> limit as defined above for the respective frequency span.

> span, scaled by -10log~10~(_n_), where _n_ is the number of _TAB connectors_
> in the _TAB connector RX min cell group_.
## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation
### 7.7.1 General
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver unit to
receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
two interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the
wanted signal. The requirement applies per _TAB connector._
### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation
#### 7.7.2.1 General intermodulation minimum requirement
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA or UTRA signal as
specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 [9], annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ or
_Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
_Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ or _Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For _multi-band TAB connectors_ , the requirement applies in addition inside
any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ at those connectors, in case the gap size is at
least twice as wide as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency
offset from the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edge_. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ inside
the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the _TAB connector_ , using the parameters in tables
7.7.2.1-1 and 7.7.2.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the _maximum
throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 36.104
[8], subclause 7.2.1.
\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6], subclause 7.2.1.
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 [7], subclause 7.2.1.2.

# 8 Performance requirements
## 8.1 General
Performance requirements specify the ability of the AAS BS to correctly
demodulate signals in various conditions and configurations.
The demodulation requirements for an AAS BS are the same as non-AAS BS
demodulation requirements specified for:
\- _Single RAT UTRA operation_ in 3GPP TS 25.104 [9] clause 8 for FDD
operation, and in 3GPP TS 25.105 [10] clause 8 for TDD operation,
\- _Single RAT E-UTRA operation_ in 3GPP TS 36.104 [11], subclauses 8.1 --
8.4.
### 8.1.1 UTRA operation
Performance requirements for _single RAT UTRA operation_ in FDD are specified
for the measurement channels defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 [2] and 3GPP TS 25.105
[3]. The requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are
supported by AAS BS. For FRC8 in 3GPP TS 25.104 [2] the non E-DPCCH boosting
and E-DPCCH boosting requirement only apply for the option supported by the
AAS BS. The performance requirements for the high speed train scenarios
defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 [2] and 3GPP TS 25.105 [3] are optional.
Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single cell
only. Performance requirements for an AAS BS supporting UTRA FDD DC-HSUPA or
DB-DC-HSUPA and UTRA TDD MC_HSUPA are defined in terms of single carrier
requirements. For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with
the transmitter unit(s) ascociated with the _TAB connectors(s)_ in the
operating band ON.
NOTE: In normal operating conditions the _TAB connectors(s)_ in UTRA FDD
operation are configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The
transmitter unit(s) ascociated with the _TAB connectors_ may be OFF for some
of the tests as specified in TS 37.145-1 [26] and TS 37.145-2 [27].
In the referred UTRA specifications and in this section, the term BS with RX
diversity refers to performance requirements for two _demodulation branches_ ,
and BS without RX diversity refers to performance requirements for one
_demodulation branch_.
For AAS BS with RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements with RX
diversity apply, the required E~b~/N~0~ for UTRA FDD and Î~or~/I~oc~ for UTRA
TDD shall be applied separately for each _demodulation branch_.
For AAS BS without RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements without
RX diversity apply. The required E~b~/N~0~ for UTRA FDD and Î~or~/I~oc~ for
UTRA TDD shall be applied for each AAS BS _demodulation branch_.
The E~b~/N~0~ used for UTRA FDD is defined as:
Where:
is the received total energy of DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH, HS-DPCCH, E-DPDCH, S-E-
DPDCH, E-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH per PN chip per _demodulation branch_ from all
branches
is the total one-sided noise power spectral density due to all noise sources
is the number of chips per frame
is the number of information bits in DTCH excluding CRC bits per frame

ascociated with the _TAB connectors(s)_ in the operating band ON.
NOTE: In normal operating conditions _TAB connectors_ in FDD operation are
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter unit(s)
associated with the _TAB connectors_ may be OFF for some of the tests as
specified in TS 37.145-1 [26] and TS 37.145-2 [27].
In the referred E-UTRA specification, the term \"RX antennas\" refers to
_demodulation branches_ (and not physical antennas).

SNR = S / N
Where:
S is the total signal energy in the subframe on a single _TAB connector_.
N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the _transmission
bandwidth_ over the duration of a subframe.
For enhanced performance requirements type A, the SINR used in this clause is
specified based on a single carrier and defined as:
Where:
is the total signal energy in the subframe on a single _TAB connector_.
is the summation of the received energy of the strongest interferers
explicitly defined in a test procedure plus the white noise energy _N_ , in a
bandwidth corresponding to the transmission bandwidth over the duration of a
subframe on a single _TAB connector_. The respective energy of each interferer
relative to is defined by its associated DIP value.

# 9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
## 9.1 General
Radiated transmitter characteristics requirements apply on the AAS BS
including all its functional components active and for all foreseen modes of
operation of the AAS BS unless otherwise stated.
## 9.2 Radiated transmit power
### 9.2.1 General
An AAS BS is declared to support one or more beams. Radiated transmit power is
defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific _beam peak
direction_.
For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam identity,
_reference beam direction pair_ , _beamwidth_ , _rated beam EIRP_ , _EIRP
accuracy directions set_ , the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering
directions and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and _beamwidth(s)_.
For a declared beam and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam EIRP_ level is
the maximum power that the base station is declared to radiate at the
associated _beam peak direction_ during the _transmitter ON period_.
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _EIRP accuracy directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing as detailed in TS
37.145-2 [27].
NOTE 1: _EIRP accuracy directions set_ is set of _beam peak directions_ for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The _beam peak
directions_ are related to a corresponding contiguous range or discrete list
of _beam centre directions_ by the _beam direction pairs_ included in the set.
NOTE 2: A _beam direction pair_ is data set consisting of the _beam centre
direction_ and the related _beam peak direction._
NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer for
verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the manufacturer to
the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment and is not subject to
formal conformance testing.
### 9.2.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within the _EIRP accuracy
directions set_ , a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the corresponding _beam
peak direction_ shall be achievable to within +2,2 dB and -2,2 dB of the
claimed value.

# 10 Radiated receiver characteristics
## 10.1 General
OTA receiver characteristics requirements apply to the _AAS BS_ including all
its functional components active unless otherwise stated in each requirement.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 10 apply during the AAS BS
_receive period._
The requirements in clause 10 shall be met for any transmitter setting.
The (E-UTRA) throughput requirements defined for the receiver characteristics
in this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
When the AAS BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
## 10.2 OTA sensitivity
### 10.2.1 General
The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or more
_OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD), related to an _AAS BS
receiver_.
The _AAS BS receiver_ may optionally be capable of redirecting/changing the
_receiver target_ by means of adjusting BS settings resulting in multiple
_sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting from the current AAS BS
settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the AAS BS is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD then the OSDD shall include:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to any active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target
redirection range_ in the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the AAS BS.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 37.145-2 [27].
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
NOTE 3: (Void)
If the _AAS BS_ is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to
the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 4: For AAS BS without target redirection capability, the declared (fixed)
_sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation
The minimum requirements for a UTRA FDD and for UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps option
carrier OTA sensitivity are defined in subclause 10.2.3.
The minimum requirement for an E-UTRA carrier OTA sensitivity is defined in
subclause 10.2.4.
### 10.2.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation
For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as described below
shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is equal to the minimum EIS
level in the respective declared set of EIS level, RAT and _channel
bandwidth_.
For UTRA FDD, the BER shall not exceed 0,001, using the 12,2 kbps data rate
reference measurement channel specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 [2].
For UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps option, the BER shall not exceed 0,001, using the 12,2
kbps data rate reference measurement channel specified in 3GPP TS 25.105 [3].
NOTE: The requirement applies for all declared sets of EIS, RAT and _channel
bandwidth_ , within the OSDD comprising UTRA, and for all related active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ settings within the AAS BS capability.
### 10.2.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation
For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of an OSDD the throughput criterion, as described below,
shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is equal to the minimum EIS
level in the respective declared set of EIS level, RAT and _channel
bandwidth_.
The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the _maximum throughput_ of the reference
measurement channel as specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 [4] with parameters
specified in table 10.2.4-1.

NOTE 1: The requirement applies for all declared sets of EIS level, RAT and
_channel bandwidth_ , within the OSDD comprising E-UTRA, and for all related
active _sensitivity RoAoA_ settings within the AAS BS capability.
NOTE 2: Several OSDD EIS level declarations corresponding to different
_channel bandwidths_ may be made.
