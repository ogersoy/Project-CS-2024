# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**active antenna system base station:** BS system which combines an a _ntenna
array_ with an _transceiver unit array_. An AAS BS may include a radio
distribution network
**array element:** subdivision of a passive _antenna array_ , consisting of a
single radiating element or a group of radiating elements, with a fixed
radiation pattern
**antenna array:** group of radiating elements characterized by the geometry
and the properties of the _array elements_
**array factor: radiation pattern of an array antenna when each _array
element_ is considered to radiate isotropically**
NOTE: When the radiation pattern of individual _array elements_ are identical,
and the _array elements_ are congruent under translation, then the product of
the _array factor_ and the _array element_ radiation pattern gives the
radiation pattern of the entire array.
**angle of arrival:** is the direction of propagation of electromagnetic wave
incident on an AAS BS _antenna array_
**beam:** beam (of the antenna) is the main lobe of the radiation pattern of
an _antenna array_
NOTE: For certain AAS BS _antenna array_ , there may be more than one beam.
**beam centre direction:** direction equal to the geometric centre of the
half-power contour of the beam
**beam direction pair:** data set consisting of the _beam centre direction_
and the related _beam peak direction_
**beam peak direction:** direction where the maximum EIRP is found
**beamwidth:** beam which has a half-power contour that is essentially
elliptical, the half-power beamwidths in the two pattern cuts that
respectively contain the major and minor axis of the ellipse
**cell specific beam:** _Cell specific beam_ is a beam which is intended to
facilitate communication for multiple UEs within a cell
**cell splitting:** division of the cell\'s coverage in a sector into multiple
subsectors.
NOTE: The subsectors may be divided into the vertical and/or horizontal plane.
**demodulation branch:** single input to the demodulation algorithms.
NOTE: For UTRA a _demodulation branch_ is referred to as a receive diversity
branch or a UL MIMO branch. For E-UTRA a _demodulation branch_ is referred to
as an RX Antenna in the performance requirement tables.
NOTE: The term \"RX antenna\" in chapter 8 of the E-UTRA specification 3GPP TS
36.104 [7] does not refer to physical receiver antennas, but to the
_demodulation branches_.
**directions diagram:** two dimensional Cartesian diagram showing Φ on the
horizontal axis and minus Θ on the vertical axis
**directivity: ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction from the
antenna to the radiation intensity averaged over all directions**
NOTE: If the direction is not specified, the direction of maximum radiation
intensity is implied.
**EIRP accuracy directions set:** _beam peak directions_ for which the EIRP
accuracy requirement is intended to be met.
NOTE: The _beam peak directions_ are related to a corresponding contiguous
range or discrete list of _beam centre directions_ by the _beam direction
pairs_ included in the set.
**equivalent isotropic radiated power:** in a given direction, the relative
gain of a transmitting antenna with respect to the gain of an isotropic
radiating element multiplied by the net power accepted by the antenna from the
connected transmitter
NOTE: For an AAS BS the EIRP can be seen as the equivalent power radiated from
an isotropic radiating element, producing the same field intensity as the
field intensity radiated in the declared beam pointing direction of the active
antenna system being considered.
**equivalent isotropic sensitivity:** power level relative to an isotropic
antenna that is required to be incident on the AAS BS array from a specified
azimuth/elevation direction in order to meet a specified receiver sensitivity
requirement

would be collected by an isotropic antenna if it were subject to a uniform
field around the whole sphere as the AAS BS array experiences in the specified
azimuth/elevation direction.
**front-to-back ratio: ratio of maximum directivity of an antenna to its
directivity in a specified rearward direction**
**gain: ratio of the radiation intensity, in a given direction, to the
radiation intensity that would be obtained if the power accepted by the
antenna were radiated isotropically**
NOTE: If the direction is not specified, the direction of maximum radiation
intensity is implied.
**multi-band TAB connector:** _TAB connector_ supporting operation in multiple
operating bands through common active electronic components(s)
_NOTE: For common TX and RX TAB connectors, the definition applies where
common active electronic components are in the transmit path and/or in the

comprising an EIS value and the directions where it applies
**receiver target:** angles of arrival in which reception is performed
**receiver target redirection range:** union of all the _sensitivity RoAoA_
achievable through redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the OSDD
**receiver target reference direction: direction, inside the _receiver target
redirection range_ declared by the manufacturer for conformance testing.**
NOTE: For an OSDD without _receiver target redirection range_ , this is a
direction inside the _sensitivity RoAoA_.
**reference beam direction pair: declared _beam direction pair_ , including
reference _beam centre direction_ and reference _beam peak direction_ where
the reference _beam peak direction_ is the direction for the intended maximum
EIRP within the EIRP accuracy compliance directions set**

# 4 General
## 4.1 Work Item scope
This Work Item (WI) is to specify Radio Frequency (RF) requirements for Active
Antenna System (AAS) Base Station (BS) covering single Radio Access Technology
(RAT) capable BS supporting UTRA or E-UTRA, and multi-RAT capable BS operating
in Band Category (BC) 1 and BC3, for Wide Area (WA), Medium Range (MR), and
Local Area (LA) coverage to ensure necessary coexistence. Wide Area BS will be
prioritized.
## 4.2 Work Item objectives
A Study Item (SI) phase on Active Antenna System BS was concluded and the
investigation results are captured in 3GPP TR 37.840 [2]. Particularly the SI
conclusion is captured in subclause 9 in 3GPP TR 37.840 [2]. A WI was approved
in [3] and the objectives of the Work Item are to firstly decide the list of
radiated requirements as well as the list of conducted requirements based on
the identified representative deployment scenarios, and then to create the
specifications for the requirements that are applicable to AAS BS.
The AAS BS test methods and specification of the conformance requirements
corresponding to the core requirements will be defined.
Detailed WI texts are presented in [3].
## 4.3 General AAS BS RF architecture
The AAS BS radio architecture is represented by three main functional blocks,
the _transceiver unit array_ (TRXUA), the _radio distribution network_ (RDN),
and the _antenna array_ (AA). The _transceiver units_ (TRXU) interface with
the base band processing within the AAS BS.
The TRXUA consists of multiple transmitter units (TXU) and receiver units
(RXUs). The TXU takes the baseband input from the AAS BS and provides the RF
TX outputs. The transmitted signal of the same carrier from different
_transceiver units_ does not appear at a common _TAB connector_. The RF TX
outputs are distributed to the AA via the RDN. The RXU performs the reverse of
the TXU operations. The RDN performs the distribution of the TX outputs into
the corresponding antenna paths and antenna elements, and a distribution of RX
inputs from antenna paths in the reverse direction. The TXU and RXU can be
separated and can have different mapping through the RDN towards the AA.
The transceiver array boundary (TAB) is the point or points at which the TRXUA
is connected to the RDN. The point where a TXU or RXU connects with the RDN is
equivalent to an \"antenna connector\" of a non-AAS BS and is called
\"Transceiver Array Boundary connector\" (_TAB connector_). The _TAB
connector_ is defined as conducted requirement reference point. The
transmitted signal per carrier from one Transmitter Unit appear at one or more
_TAB connector(s)_ and the received signals per carrier from one or more _TAB
connector(s)_ appear at a single RXU.
Figure 4.3-1 shows a general AAS BS radio architecture, where N~TRXU~ is the
total number of _transceiver units_ and N~TABC~ is the total number of _TAB
connectors_ at the transceiver array boundary.
NOTE 1: The RDN may consist of a simple one to one mapping between the
TXU(s)/RXU(s) and the passive _antenna array_. In this case, the RDN would be
a logical entity but not necessarily a physical entity.
NOTE 2: The _antenna array_ includes various implementations and
configurations e.g. polarization, array geometry (including element factor and
element separation), etc.
**NOTE 3:** The physical location of theTRXUA, the RDN, and the AA may differ
from this logical representation and is implementation dependent.
NOTE 4: No specific mapping in the RDN between _TAB connectors_ and antenna
elements is assumed. Further the number of separate receiver and transmitter
units as well as the mapping in the RDN between _TAB connectors_ and radiating
elements can differ between the transmit and receive directions. The AAS BS
reference architecture allows for full asymmetry between receive path and
transmit path.
NOTE 5: For AAS BS capable of supporting applications employing beamforming,
all or subgroups of _TAB connectors_ can be configured with designated
amplitude and phase weights such that one or more beams are radiated from the
_antenna array_.
NOTE 6: If the TR text and figure 4.3-1 contradict each other, then the TR
text applies.
Figure 4.3-1: General AAS BS radio architecture
A base station with AAS, with general radio architecture as shown in figure
4.3-1, is generic to all types of AAS structures including diversity,
beamforming, spatial multiplexing, or any combination of the three.
## 4.4 Specification organization
The technical specification for the AAS BS core requirements is titled:
\- 3GPP TS 37.105 [22].
The structure follows a similar pattern to the MSR specification. However the
structure explicitly captures both MSR and single RAT requirements such that
AAS BS can be built as single RAT or MSR.
The level 1 and level 2 headings are be arranged as follows:
1 Scope
2 Reference
3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
3.1 Definitions
3.2 Symbols
3.3 Abbreviations
3.4 Spatial parameters
4\. General
4.1 Relationship between the AAS BS specification and non AAS single RAT & MSR

4.5 Regional Requirements
4.6 Operating Bands and Band Categories
4.7 Channel arrangements
4.8 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
4.9 Requirements for AAS BS capable of multi-band operation
5\. Applicability of Requirements
6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
6.1 General
6.2 Base station output power
6.3 Output power dynamics
6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
6.5 Transmitted signal quality

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
7\. Conducted receiver characteristics

7.2 Reference sensitivity level

8 Performance requirements
9\. Radiated transmitter characteristics
9.1 General
9.2 Radiated Tx Power
10\. Radiated receiver characteristics
10.1 General
10.2 OTA sensitivity
The conducted chapters are arranged in a similar manner to the existing
specifications. However each requirement has 4 clauses; general, single RAT
E-UTRA, single RAT UTRA and MSR:
\- An MSR basestation conforms to all MSR clauses, and single RAT basestations
to all single RAT clauses for the respective RAT.
\- For requirements for which there is a generic MSR requirement, the MSR
clause contains the generic MSR requirement and if needed references to
additional single RAT requirements in the single RAT clauses of the AAS BS
document.
\- For requirements that are single RAT only, the MSR clause states this and
refers to the appropriate single RAT clauses.
\- No changes will be made (apart from AAS specific ones) to existing
requirements; i.e. no single RAT only requirements will be changed to MSR
ones.
## 4.5 Applicability of requirements
\
# 5 Application and coexistence scenarios
## 5.1 Objectives
A downlink co-existence simulation campaign was performed with the objective
of establishing whether the radiated adjacent channel emissions pattern for an
AAS BS aggressor system, which differs from a non-AAS BS aggressor system,
impact co-existence KPIs such as mean and 5^th^ percentile throughput losses
in the context of the co-existence simulation framework of 3GPP TR 25.942 [4].
Co-existence characteristics were studied in a macro scenario in which cell
specific beamforming was performed. This scenario is directly comparable with
the simulations performed when deriving the existing ACLR and ACS requirements
as outline in 3GPP TR 36.942 [5].
Cell specific beamforming creates static patterns of interference that differ
between AAS BS and non-AAS BS. Other types of beamforming, such as user
specific beamforming create patterns which are time varying and are composed
of intermodulation between multiple beams. Cell specific beamforming thus
represents a worst case spatial interference behaviour, since its radiated
pattern is not averaged across multiple beams or in time.
In addition, an uplink simulation was performed with the objective of
establishing blocking levels that are likely to be encountered by an AAS BS
victim system within the context of the 3GPP TR 36.942 [5] framework. The
blocking simulations were performed using the same system scenario as that
used to derive the existing LTE blocking requirements.
## 5.2 Simulation scenarios
### 5.2.1 Vertical/horizontal cell splitting applications
Based on AAS BS using vertical/horizontal cell splitting applications, the
E-UTRA Macro to E-UTRA Macro coexistence scenario is identified for the
purpose of studying the spatial characteristics of AAS BS. Simulation cases
for both downlink and uplink were made and shown in table 5.2.1-1 and Table
5.2.1-2 are applied for evaluating ACLR and in-band blocking for AAS BS.

### 5.3.2 UE specific beamforming simulation assumptions
In case of UE specific beamforming, the AAS BS may generate
{width="0.3888888888888889in" height="0.25in"} beams, each pointing to a
specific UE. The overall radiation pattern of the
{width="0.3888888888888889in" height="0.25in"} beams can be derived as:
{width="3.7777777777777777in" height="0.5555555555555556in"}
where {width="0.6111111111111112in" height="0.25in"} is the element pattern
defined in table 5.3.3.1-1, and {width="0.4027777777777778in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}and {width="0.2777777777777778in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}are the _array factors_ defined in table
5.3.2-1.
Due to the non-linearization characteristics of the transmitters, the 3^rd^
order intermodulation productions generated by the
{width="0.3888888888888889in" height="0.25in"} beams may be pointed to
different directions as the weighting vector for each of the beams are
involved in the intermodulation process, and combinations of any three of the
weighting vectors generated a different direction for the 3^rd^ order
intermodulation product. The overall radiation pattern of the IMD3 products
can be derived as:
{width="5.397916666666666in" height="0.5520833333333334in"}
where {width="0.6666666666666666in" height="0.2638888888888889in"}is number of
IMD3 beams generated, and {width="1.1388888888888888in" height="0.25in"}.
Please be noted that the triplet (p, q, l) is order sensitive and they
represent any of the three UE specific beams with an intermodulation relation
of p+q- l. Please also be noted that p, q, l can take the same value.
Therefore:
{width="0.6666666666666666in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}={width="0.3888888888888889in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}
and {width="0.9402777777777778in" height="0.24027777777777778in"} is the
weighting vector for the IMD3 products generated by the three beams and:
{width="0.9402777777777778in" height="0.24027777777777778in"}={width="0.875in"
height="0.5in"}
The weighting factor above is for the IMD3 products
{width="0.4166666666666667in" height="0.2638888888888889in"} which is
generated by{width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}+{width="0.19375in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}-{width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.25in"}, where {width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, {width="0.19375in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, and {width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.25in"} represent any frequency component in beam p, q, l
correspondingly.
Based on the radiation pattern of wanted signal and IMD3 products, the ACLR
pattern can be derived as:
{width="4.8375in" height="1.0090277777777779in"}+{width="0.7916666666666666in"
height="0.25in"}
where {width="0.7916666666666666in" height="0.25in"}is the ACLR performance of
each transmitter.
The assumption in table 5.4.3.1-1 in 3GPP TR 37.840 [2] was used for UE
beamforming scenarios but the number of UEs activated in each cell is assumed
to be 4. A 10x4 _antenna array_ is employed to generate beams pointed directly
at each UE dropped in cell.

### 5.3.3 Antenna array model
#### 5.3.3.1 General
The AAS BS _antenna array_ model is determined by _array element_ pattern,
_array factor_ and signals applied to the system. The element pattern and
composite antenna pattern are defined in the subclauses 5.3.3.2 and 5.3.3.3.
NOTE: The $\theta$and $\phi$definition in this subclause is based on the
coordinate system in subclause 5.4.4.1 of 3GPP TR 37.840 [2].

### 5.3.4 Propagation Model
The minimum BS to UE distance in Macro cell scenario is set to 35 meter in the
system simulation with reference to a 70 dB Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) in the
worst case where the BS antenna gain (both array gain and element gain) and UE
antenna gain is assumed to be zero. This is also aligned with the parameters
suggested in subclause 4.1.1.2 in 3GPP TR 25.942 [4]. The calculated free
space path loss is about 67dB based on 35 meter minimum distance separation.
The MCL would be around 70 dB if 2dB cable loss and 1dB body loss is
considered. Considering that the cable loss for AAS BS would be smaller than
2dB, the simulation results would imply a little bit tighter requirements.
Nevertheless, MCL is a statistical parameter in nature and the minimum BS to
UE distance separation calculated deterministically using the free space path
loss model doesn\'t mandate the minimum BS to UE distance separation as a
deployment condition for AAS BS.
The path loss model is defined as below:
Path_Loss = max {L(R), Free_Space_Loss}+ shadowfading
where the free space loss is defined as:
Free_Space_Loss = 98.46 + 20^.^log~10~(R) (R in kilometre)
and L(R) is defined as below:
L(R) = 128.1 + 37.6^.^Log~10~(R) (dB)
The shadow fading is modelled as a log-normal distribution.
Then the final coupling loss model is defined as below:
Coupling_Loss_macro= max {Path_Loss, Free_Space_Loss} - G_Tx - G_Rx
where G_Tx is the transmitter antenna gain and the G_Rx is the receiver
antenna gain.
## 5.4 Simulation conclusions
In all of the cell and user specific scenarios that were modeled, the spatial
pattern of an AAS BS aggressor system did not increase the mean or 5^th^
percentile throughput loss in the victim system beyond what is experienced
with a passive system. Therefore it is concluded that the existence of a
different spatial distribution of adjacent channel interference that arises
from an AAS BS compared to non-AAS BS does not necessitate any additional type
of requirement. Furthermore, the simulations indicated that the existing ACLR
requirement of 45 dB can be applied per transceiver, or across all
transceivers for an AAS BS.
# 6 AAS BS classifications
## 6.1 Minimum coupling loss
AAS BS is classified according to the deployment scenarios defined in
subclause 5.2.1 in 3GPP TR 37.840 [2] and those scenarios are the same as for
non-AAS BS. One of the key parameters that characterise each of the deployment
scenarios is the MCL between BS and UE, which includes the path loss and the
antenna gains of both UE and BS.
## 6.2 BS classifications
Wide Area BS are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell
scenarios. For AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, the minimum coupling loss between
any _TAB connector_ and the UE is 70 dB.
Medium Range BS are characterised by requirements derived from Micro Cell
scenarios. For AAS BS of Medium Range BS class, the minimum coupling loss
between any _TAB connector_ and the UE is 53 dB.
Local Area BS are characterised by requirements derived from Pico Cell
scenarios. For AAS BS of Local Area BS class, the minimum coupling loss
between any _TAB connector_ and the UE is 45 dB.
NOTE: In selecting these minimum coupling losses, it has been assumed that the
antenna aperture for AAS BS is roughly similar to that for non-AAS BS so that
the methodologies for setting minimum BS to UE distance separation in 3GPP TR
36.942 [5] and 3GPP TR 25.942 [4]can be reused.
# 7 Radiated requirements
## 7.1 General
In legacy systems (i.e. passive antenna systems), power accuracy can be
characterized by means of considering the conducted output power together with
the antenna gain. However, in an AAS BS there is an interaction between
different subsystems (_transceiver unit array_ , RDN, _antenna array_) which
motivated the need for radiated RF requirements.
OTA requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic and spatial
parameters. The electromagnetic parameters are specified either in terms of
power (dBm) or field strength (dBμV/m). The spatial parameters are specified
in a Cartesian coordinate system (_x, y, z_) using spherical coordinates (r,
Θ,**__** φ). The orientation of these coordinates is depicted in the following
figures. φ** __** is the angle in the x/y plane and it is between the x-axis
and the projection of the vector onto the x/y plane and is defined between
-180° and +180°, inclusive. Θ*** *** is the angle between the projection of
the vector in the x/y plane and the vector and is defined between -90° and
+90°, inclusive.
A point in the Cartesian coordinate system (_x_ ,_y_ ,_z_) can be transformed
to spherical coordinates (r, Θ,**__** φ) using the following relationships:
The inverse transformation is given by:
The representation and definitions of angles are described in figure 7.1-1,
figure 7.1-2 and figure 7.1-3.
Figure 7.1-1: Orthogonal representation of coordinate system
Figure 7.1-2: Definition of the φ angle
Figure 7.1-3: Definition of Θ angle
The vendor declares the location of this coordinate system origin in reference
to an identifiable physical feature of the AAS BS enclosure. The vendor also
declares the orientation of this coordinate system in reference to an
identifiable physical feature of the AAS BS enclosure.
## 7.2 Radiated transmit power requirements
### 7.2.1 General
The minimum requirements for AAS BS radiated transmit power, are placed on one
or more manufacturer declared beam(s) that are intended for cell-wide
coverage.
The characteristics of the manufacturer declared beam and the requirement on
the declared EIRP are defined in the subclauses 7.2.2 to 7.2.6 below.
### 7.2.2 Beam definitions
A beam (of the antenna) is the main lobe of the radiation pattern of an
_antenna array_. An AAS BS beam is created by means of a superposition of the
signals radiated from different parts of the AAS BS _antenna array_.
A _cell specific beam_ is an AAS BS beam which is intended to facilitate
communication to all UEs within a cell.
A UE specific beam is an AAS BS beam which is intended to facilitate
communication to a specific UE or a specific group of UEs.
Each _beam direction pair_ is associated with half-power contour of the _beam
centre direction_ and a _beam peak direction_. The EIRP is declared at the
_beam peak direction_. The _beam centre direction_ is used for describing beam
steering.
{width="6.489583333333333in" height="2.8645833333333335in"}
Figure 7.2.2-1: Example of _beam direction pair_
In figure 7.2.2-1 left sub-figure shows a symmetrical beam where _beam centre
direction_ and _beam peak direction_ are the same. In figure 7.2.2-1 right
sub-figure shows an example of a beam with ripple where the _beam centre
direction_ and the _beam peak direction_ are different.
For an AAS BS beam, the following parameters that belong to the beam are
declared:
\- A beam identifier.
\- A _reference beam direction pair_ , including reference _beam peak
direction_ and reference _beam centre direction_.
\- A maximum EIRP achieved in the _beam peak direction_ when the _beam
direction pair_ is set to the _reference beam direction pair_.
\- The _EIRP accuracy directions set._
\- Four further _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering directions,
where the maximum steering direction is the _beam direction pair_ associated
with the maximum _beam centre steering direction_. Selection of these 4
maximum steering directions is described in subclause 7.1.4.
\- For each of the four further _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering
directions:
\- Maximum EIRP achieved in the _beam peak direction_ (one EIRP per _beam
direction pair_).
\- Beamwidth (one beamwidth per _beam direction pair_).
NOTE: If an AAS BS is not capable of beam repositioning in one or both
directions, any of the maximum steering directions may be the same as the
_reference beam direction_.
The term \"maximum steering direction\" refers to maximum repositioning
capability of the _beam centre direction_ of the beam by any means, and makes
no assumption about the type of implementation.
### 7.2.3 EIRP accuracy requirements
#### 7.2.3.1 General
The minimum requirement for radiated transmit power will be on the accuracy
with which declared EIRP level is met.
For each beam, the maximum configurable EIRP measured at the _beam peak
direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ corresponding to the main
beam are declared.
#### 7.2.3.2 Impacts of accuracy on network performance
The actual output power levels of any two AAS BS(s) (or any two transmitting
equipments) are not identical. It should be noted however that the output
power of a particular BS is fairly stable once it\'s manufactured for
shipment. Due to setting the accuracy requirements on output power, the output
power levels of a group of BS(s) will be relatively consistent around a rated
output power. This means that some of BS(s) may deliver power a little bit
higher, but some of them may be a little bit lower, but all are around the
rated power. The impacts on the network of the variability of output power
between different base stations are that the application coverage of some
cells may be a little bit larger, and others may be a little bit smaller
compared with a calculated application coverage based on nominal output power.
In some situations it is difficult to tell whether consistently large output
power is better as large output power also increases the inter-cell
interference. In real network, the coverage is also impacted by other
parameters such as deployment environment. One typical and efficient approach
to tune the cell coverage is by adjusting the antenna tilt which results in
signal strength changes in several decibels. Large deviation of expected EIRP
could impact the estimation of correct tilt angles.
#### 7.2.3.3 Impacts of accuracy on the manufacturing process
The accuracy requirements on output power drive the manufacturing process to
deliver the output power as close as possible to the rated output power in
order to achieve a reasonable level of the yield rate. For the same accuracy
requirement in specification, the more accurate of the output power is
manufactured, the higher the yield rate achieved, Therefore, the components in
massive manufacturing process need to be of high precision exceeding the
accuracy requirement in specification in order to achieve an acceptable yield
rate, and thus an accuracy value should be selected that is a good trade-off
between network coverage and cost considerations.
#### 7.2.3.4 EIRP accuracy
EIRP accuracy refers to the maximum deviation of the DUT (i.e. the AAS BS) to
a declared performance requirement.
The AAS base station EIRP accuracy requirement has been determined by taking
into account the following factors:
\- non AAS base station EIRP accuracy; and
\- an estimate of the achievable accuracy by AAS BS.
The estimated EIRP accuracy of a non-AAS BS is used as the baseline for the
AAS BS, which is then adapted to derive the EIRP accuracy requirements for AAS
BS.
Preliminary investigations of the impact of EIRP accuracy on network
performance indicate that a Wide Area AAS base station EIRP accuracy of around
±2.25 dB enables throughput to be predicted to within 5 % variation.
For an AAS BS, the EIRP accuracy is influenced by a number of factors that do
not linearly combine. Nevertheless, as an approximation, from the AAS BS radio
architecture, the EIRP accuracy of an AAS BS can be estimated by considering
the steering error (translated from the phase error of the beam) and the
inaccuracy of _antenna array_.
Based on the above the EIRP accuracy can be approximated using root sum square
of the error sources which are all assumed to be Gaussian distributed in the
dB domain and uncorrelated. As a result of these assumptions, the root sum
square EIRP accuracy can be approximated in a logarithmic scale by:
$\text{EIRP}_{\text{accuracy}} = \sqrt{\sigma_{\text{tx}}^{2} +
\sigma_{\text{steer}}^{2} + \sigma_{\text{array}}^{2}}$[dB]
where:
$\sigma_{\text{tx}}$ - is the maximum conducted output power error at the
_transceiver unit_ output.
$\sigma_{\text{steer}}$ - is the variation in main beam EIRP due to
beamforming errors caused by phase error at the _transceiver unit_ output.
$\sigma_{\text{array}}$ - is the variation due to the error in the passive
elements, the RDN, the _antenna array_ gain errors, mismatch errors and
insertion losses variations.
The inaccuracy of RDN and the aforementioned factors are incorporated in the
array error as defined above.
It should be noted that the use of a root square sum implies that the 3
factors are independent Gaussian distributed, which may not be the case. This
could potentially be an error source in this model.
Based on the network performance evaluation, and EIRP accuracy proposal from
different companies listed in annex D, the EIRP accuracy requirement for AAS
BS is determined as ±2,2 dB for each declared maximum EIRP per carrier.
The Rel-13 non-AAS BS specifications specify same conducted output power
accuracy for all BS classes. The same EIRP accuracy is assumed for all AAS BS
classes. EIRP accuracy for each AAS BS class (Wide Area, Medium Range and
Local Area AAS BS) could be revised if deviation from this assumption is
justified.
### 7.2.4 The core requirements
The radiated transmit power generated by the AAS BS is distributed in the
space by means of radiating and allocation of conducted power to single or
multiple beams. The beam configuration and corresponding power allocated to
each beam is application dependent.
The radiated transmit power per beam of the AAS BS is the maximum achievable
EIRP in a declared _beam peak direction_ for a manufacturer-declared AAS BS
beam generated during the transmitter ON period. The minimum requirement for
radiated transmit power is specified for one or more manufacturer-declared AAS
beam(s). The AAS BS beam definition is described in subclause 7.1.1.
The number of declared AAS BS beams is for the manufacturer to declare. Some
examples of declarations of beams are illustrated in a _directions diagram_ in
figure 7.2.4-1.
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="3.4604166666666667in"}
Figure 7.2.4-1: Examples of AAS BS beam declarations depicted in a _directions
diagram_
In figure 7.2.4-1 the shaded areas/points represent the declared EIRP
directions set, which may be continuous (top right, bottom right) or not
continuous (bottom left), or be restricted to just the points of maximum
steering (top left). The red coloured points represent the compliance test
points at which EIRP is declared. The maximum EIRP and its accuracy are
defined for the declared beams when activated individually on all
corresponding RE and the requirements are placed per individual beam.
The maximum radiated transmit power of the AAS BS beam is the mean power level
measured at the declared _beam peak direction_ at the RF channels B (bottom),
M (middle) and T (top) when configured for maximum EIRP value for a specific
AAS BS beam of the supported frequency channels declared by the manufacturer.
In normal condition, when a beam is steered within the maximum EIRP directions
set, if a maximum EIRP is claimed by the manufacturer then the AAS BS maximum
EIRP should remain within +2.2 dB and -2.2 dB of the claimed value.
Intended maximum EIRP is only declared for the _beam peak direction_
associated with the _reference beam direction pair_ and the _beam peak
directions_ associated with the _beam direction pairs_ corresponding to the
maximum steering directions; for the remainder of the EIRP directions set
there is no need to declare maximum EIRP as part of the 3GPP compliance
declaration.
### 7.2.5 The conformance requirements
For conformance testing purposes, for each declared AAS BS beam, the vendor
declares four _beam peak directions_ corresponding to four maximum steering
directions. These are the _beam direction pair_ associated with the maximum
beam centre steering direction and are defined as follows:
\- The _beam peak direction_ corresponding to the maximum steering from the
reference _beam centre direction_ in the positive φ direction while
maintaining the reference _beam centre direction_ Θ value.
\- The _beam peak direction_ corresponding to the maximum steering from the
reference _beam centre direction_ in the negative φ direction while
maintaining the reference _beam centre direction_ Θ value.
\- The _beam peak direction_ corresponding to the maximum steering from the
reference _beam centre direction_ in the positive Θ direction while
maintaining the reference _beam centre direction_ φ value.
\- The _beam peak direction_ corresponding to the maximum steering from the
reference _beam centre direction_ in the negative Θ direction while
maintaining the reference _beam centre direction_ φ value.
NOTE: It should be noted that in some cases, one or more maximum steering
directions may coincide with the reference _beam centre direction_.

The grey shaded area in figure 7.2.5-1 represents an EIRP accuracy direction
set. The maximum steering directions are in the positive and negative
directions along each axis from _the reference beam centre direction_.
The measured maximum EIRP should be within +(2.2+TestTolerance) to
-(2.2+TestTolerance) (dB) of the respective declared EIRP values at the _beam
peak direction_ when the _beam direction pair_ is set to each of the 4
declared maximum steering directions and to the _reference beam direction
pair_.
Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the EIRP are defined in
table 10.3.2.3-1.
### 7.2.6 The conformance beam declaration set
The vendor may declare any number of beams, the minimum requirement to declare
for conformance are the beams with the highest intend EIRP for each of the
beams widths below:
\- Narrowest intended BeW~Θ~, narrowest intended BeW~ϕ~ (possible when
narrowest intended BeW~Θ~) at the reference beam direction.
\- Narrowest intended BeW~ϕ ~, narrowest intended BeW~θ~ (possible when
narrowest intended BeW~Θ~) at the reference beam direction.
\- Widest intended BeW~Θ~ , widest intended BeW~ϕ~ (possible when widest
intended BeW~Θ~) at the reference beam direction.
\- Widest intended BeW~ϕ~ - widest intended BeW~Θ~ (possible when widest
intended BeW~ϕ~) at the reference beam direction.
\- BeW~Θ~ and BeW~ϕ~ which provide highest intended EIRP of all possible beams
at the reference beam direction.
NOTE: Depending on the capability of the system some of these beams may be the
same.
There are 2 declarations made to identify beams which have the same spatial
declarations (D9.4-9.13).
Equivalent beams are beams which are expected to have the same spatial
characteristics when presented with the same signals and are generated from
transceiver units of the same design and may be transmitted at the same time.
Equivalent beams may be generated by:
\- Common RF hardware, e.g. 2 equivalent beams are generated from 8
transceiver units where each beam utilizes all 8 transceiver units but half
the power of each transceiver unit is allocated to each beam.
\- Parallel RF hardware, e.g. 2 equivalent beams are generated from 8
transceiver units where each beam utilizes only 4 transceiver units with each
transceiver unit at full power.
In the case of equivalent beams which use common RF hardware, as during
conformance testing full, power is a required condition of the transceiver
units then all beams are switched ON in order to ensure the transmitters are
at full power.
In the case of equivalent beams which use parallel RF hardware, during
conformance testing it is only necessary to turn ON one of the parallel beams
to its maximum declared power.
If the equivalent beams are generated by parallel RF hardware then they are
also declared as parallel beams.
For certain test cases if beams are declared both equivalent and parallel, it
is only required to test a representative beam to show conformance.
Two examples of parallel beams are provided below:
\- In the first example of figure 7.1.4-A1, an array consists of a column with
2 polarizations. A beam can be produced with each polarization, two beams can
be produced, but because the beams cannot combine coherently these are
declared as 2 parallel beams.
\- In the second example of figure 7.1.4-A1, a multi-column array consists of
2 columns but there is no phase synchronisation between columns. In this case,
a beam is produced per column and polarization, but these beams do not combine
coherently and are declared as 4 parallel beams.
Figure 7.1.4-A1: Examples of multicolumn array
When in operation, an AAS BS may transmit multiple beams (for example, beams
may be transmitted that are identified by UEs by any kind of cell or UE
specific reference signals, each with different beam patterns). When
considering the minimum 5 beamwidths to declare, most examples of beams that
the AAS BS will transmit should be included. A few types of transmission could
be misinterpreted as a beam, but should not be subject to the radiated TX
power requirement. These are specifically beams that arise from groups of
transmitters that are not all phase synchronised. Typically, they arise when
codebook based precoding (based on UE feedback) is applied to non-phase
synchronized transmitters. The specification text requires that the beam
declaration captures all beamwidths that may be used during operation (whether
identified by cell or UE specific reference signals) and excludes any
\"beams\" created from non-phase synchronised transmitters.
## 7.3 OTA sensitivity requirements
### 7.3.1 General
The OTA sensitivity requirement applies to the AAS BS operating as a system,
i.e. including combining of received signals from all active receivers. Hence:
\- Combiners (however implemented) are considered part of the AAS BS.
\- Demodulators are considered part of the AAS BS.
The OTA requirement is implementation independent.
### 7.3.2 The core requirements
The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or more
_OTA sensitivity directions declaration(s)_ (OSDD), related to an AAS BS
receiver.
The _AAS BS receiver_ may optionally be capable of redirecting/changing the
_receiver target_ by means of adjusting BS settings resulting in multiple
_sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the AAS BS is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD then the OSDD includes:
\- A declared minimum EIS level, the OTA sensitivity _,_ applicable to all
_sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the AAS BS.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed below.
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting from the Rel-13 AAS BS settings is referred
to as the active _sensitivity RoAoA_. The declared OTA sensitivity applies
only to the active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target redirection
range_.
NOTE 2: Several _sensitivity RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver
target redirection range_ without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
If the AAS BS is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to
the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- A declared minimum EIS level, the OTA sensitivity _,_ applicable to the
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of the OSDD.
\- One declared _sensitivity RoAoA._
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
Figure 7.3.2-1: Direction diagram showing an example of _receiver target
redirection range_ \ of an OSDD for a AAS BS capable of redirection
In figure 7.3.2-1 a _directions diagram_ is showing a _receiver target
redirection range_ (green contour) of an OSDD and five (out of many) possible
directions of a _sensitivity RoAoA_ (shaded areas). Only one of the
_sensitivity RoAoA i_ s active at a time.
More than one OSDD may be declared. Different OSDD are independent.
For a received signal whose _angle of arrival_ is within the active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of an OSDD the throughput (in case of E-UTRA) or bit error
rate (in case of UTRA) criteria should be met when the level of the arriving
signal is equal to the declared minimum EIS. The _angle of arrival_ can be
described as a combination of φ and Θ.
The OTA sensitivity is a received signal level above which a specified
throughput (E-UTRA) or BER (UTRA) should be met.
For E-UTRA, the requirement is to meet or exceed the throughput when the AAS
BS is presented with a specified stimulus signal transmitted through a
specified channel at the OTA sensitivity level.
For UTRA, the requirement is to meet or achieve a lower BER when the AAS BS is
presented with a specified stimulus signal transmitted through a specified
channel at the OTA sensitivity level. The received signal level can be
represented as a field-strength or EIS power level. The relation between
field-strength and EIS is:
$\text{EIS}\left( \Theta,\varphi \right) = E\left( \Theta,\varphi \right) -
\text{20}\text{log}_{\text{10}}(f) + \text{77}\text{.}2$ [dBm]
where $E\left( \Theta,\varphi \right)$ is the field strength in units of
dBμV/m at $\left( \Theta,\varphi \right)$and f is carrier frequency in MHz of
a plane wave incident to the AAS BS antenna from $\left( \Theta,\varphi
\right)$within the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The _figure of merit (FOM) for OTA sensitivity is EIS for all AAS BS classes._
The stimulus signal is the fixed reference measurement channel (FRC) for
target throughputs or BER as specified in non-AAS BS requirements in 3GPP TS
25.141 [10] for UTRA FDD, 3GPP TS 25.142 [11] for UTRA TDD and 3GPP TS 36.141
[12] for E‑UTRA. The requirement assumes the FRC for non-fading conditions/no
environment.
The OTA sensitivity requirement applies per polarization, under the assumption
of polarization matching. The manufacturer declares whether dual polarization
or single polarization reception is supported for each AAS BS receiver.
The following options were discussed on the EIS declarations:
\- Option1: Define the relationship between minimum OTA EIS value and
conducted REFSENS.
\- Option2: Define a minimum declarable minimum EIS value.
\- Option3: Not to define any criterion on declared minimum EIS value. Vendors
declare the EIS values. Information is provided on the reason how the EIS
values are obtained (separately to the conformance specification).
Then, it is agreed that the EIS declarations are based on Option3 in Rel-13,
i.e. vendors declare the EIS values. Information is provided on the reason how
the EIS values are obtained (separately to the conformance specification). Any
reason is not excluded.
Note that the definition of the relationship between EIS and REFSENS, i.e.
Option1, is not defined in Rel-13 because the reference sensitivity level
equivalent to non-AAS BS can be satisfied by the conducted requirement. In
future releases, when conducted reference sensitivity is no longer specified
then it would be necessary to define any relationship based on Option 1.
### 7.3.3 The conformance requirements
If an OSDD does not include a _receiver target redirection range_ ,
conformance testing is performed for the following five directions, as
depicted in the example in figure 7.3.3-1:
\- The receiver target reference direction.
\- The direction determined by the maximum φ value achievable inside the
sensitivity RoAoA maintaining the receiver target reference direction Θ value.
\- The direction determined by the minimum φ value achievable inside the
sensitivity RoAoA maintaining the receiver target reference direction Θ value.
\- The direction determined by the maximum Θ value achievable inside the
sensitivity RoAoA maintaining the receiver target reference direction φ value.
\- The direction determined by the minimum Θ value achievable inside the
sensitivity RoAoA maintaining the receiver target reference direction φ value.
The manufacturer declares the five directions for conformance testing.
Figure 7.3.3-1: OSDD without target redirection capability
In figure 7.3.3-1 a direction diagram shows a RoAoA without _receiver target_
redirection capability. The _receiver target reference direction_ and the
extreme directions subject to conformance testing are marked by red crosses.
If an OSDD includes a _receiver target redirection range_ , conformance
testing is performed for the following five directions, as depicted in the
example in figure 7.3.3-2:
\- The receiver target reference direction.
\- The direction determined by the maximum φ value achievable inside the
receiver target redirection range maintaining the receiver target reference
direction Θ value.
\- The direction determined by the minimum φ value achievable inside the
receiver target redirection range maintaining the receiver target reference
direction Θ value.
\- The direction determined by the maximum Θ value achievable inside the
receiver target redirection range maintaining the receiver target reference
direction φ value.
\- The direction determined by the minimum Θ value achievable inside the
receiver target redirection range maintaining the receiver target reference
direction φ value.
The manufacturer declares the five directions for conformance testing, the
setting of the AAS BS to achieve conformance at each of the conformance test
directions, and the resulting _sensitivity RoAoA_ for each of these settings.

Figure 7.3.3-2: OSDD with target redirection capability
In figure 7.3.3-2, a direction diagram is showing a _receiver target
redirection range_ (with discrete settings for the _sensitivity RoAoA_). The
_receiver target reference direction_ and the extreme directions subject to
conformance testing are marked by red crosses. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ for
each conformance test setting is shown as shaded. Note that each _sensitivity
RoAoA_ is exceptionally small compared to the _receiver target redirection
range_ , for demonstration purposes.
The measured EIS should be less than the declared EIS + Test Tolerance
Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the EIS are defined in
table 10.3.2.3-2.
# 8 Conducted requirements
## 8.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in this clause are expressed for a
single _TAB connector_.
Requirement placed on the sum of power from all _TAB connector(s)_ refer to
all _TAB connector(s)_ associated with that particular single band.
If the _TAB connector(s)_ associated with a single band are all _singleband
TAB connector(s)_ then single band requirements are applied.
If the _TAB connector(s)_ associated with a single band are all _multi-band
TAB connector(s)_ then multi-band requirements and exceptions apply.
If the _TAB connectors_ associated with a single band are a mixture of
_single-band TAB connector(s)_ and _multi-band TAB connector(s)_ then this is
FFS and precluded from Rel-13.
## 8.2 Transmitter
### 8.2.1 Time alignment error
The Time Alignment Error (TAE) is defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6] and 3GPP TS
25.105 [9] for UTRA and in 3GPP TS 36.104 [7] for E-UTRA and 3GPP TS 37.104
[8] for MSR as the largest frame timing difference between any two signals
present at the BS transmitter RF antenna port(s) for a specific set of signals
and/or transmitter configurations.
For AAS BS, the transmitters in the TRXUA may be grouped and associated with
different signals corresponding to TX diversity, MIMO transmission, carrier
aggregation etc. In such scenarios, the time alignment error for AAS BS is the
largest frame timing difference between any two different LTE signals or any
two different WCDMA signals belonging to different transmitter groups at the
_TAB connectors_. The same TAE requirements specified for the legacy BS in
3GPP TS 25.104 [6], 3GPP TS 25.105 [9], 3GPP TS 36.104 [7] and 3GPP TS 37.104
[8] can then be applied for AAS BS.
For a specific set of signals/ transmitter configuration/transmission mode,
the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference between any two different
LTE signals or any two different WCDMA signals belonging to different
transmitter groups at the transceiver array boundary, where transmitter group
is associated with the _TAB connectors_ in corresponding to TX diversity, MIMO
transmission, carrier aggregation, etc.
Within a _TAB connectors beam forming group_ the time difference between such
connectors will be very small compared to the requirement. For conformance
testing of the timing difference between groups, it is acceptable that the
timing is measured between a single representative _TAB connector_ in each
_TAB connectors beam forming group_ from each pair of groups. Conformance
testing is performed between pairs of _TAB connectors_ relating to different
groups only. Timing alignment between _TAB connector_ pairs within each _TAB
connectors beam forming group_ is considered to be verified by the EIRP
conformance test.
Compliance to the TAE requirement is to be demonstrated between all pairs of
_TAB connectors beam forming groups_ ; however it is not required to
exhaustively measure the TAE between every combination of pairs of
representative _TAB connectors_. Compliance can be demonstrated by comparison
of a reduced set of representative measurement results.
Details of the vendor declaration for TAE are given in subclause 9.2.
### 8.2.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) requirements
The ACLR is defined in [6], [7] and [8] as the ratio of the filtered mean
power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The same definition will be
maintained for AAS BS.
Re-use of this definition was examined in several scenarios in the simulation
study presented in clause 5 and annex A, which observed that applying the ACLR
requirements as specified in [6], [7] and [8] to each _TAB connector_ did not
increase the mean or 5^th^ percentile throughput loss in the victim system
beyond what is experienced with a passive system. For AAS BS architectures and
deployment scenarios that can be represented by the simulation study and
analysis, the same ACLR requirements as specified in [6], [9], [7] and [8] are
judged as adequate and can be maintained.
The simulated network performance was shown to be insensitive to the
correlation level of the adjacent channel power. It has been noted in
subclause 5.4 that the simulations indicated the existing ACLR requirement of
45 dB can be applied per _TAB connector_ , or across all _TAB connectors_ for
an AAS BS.
The ACLR requirement may be applied as a requirement per _TAB connector_ or a
ratio of the power sum of the total wanted signal level to the power sum of
the power on an adjacent frequency from all _TAB connector(s)_ associated with
a particular band.
The absolute limits specified in [6], [7] and [8] are scaled for AAS BS using
the same principle for unwanted emissions in Clause 8.2.6 and defined as ACLR
absolute limit. Either the ACLR limit or ACLR absolute limit of AAS BS,
whichever less stringent is applied.
### 8.2.3 Error Vector Magnitude
The Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference between the
ideal symbols and the measured symbols after the equalization. For AAS BS, it
is proposed that the reference point for EVM requirements is reused from the
Rel-13 requirements for EVM in [6], [9], [7] and [8] as a conducted
requirement per transceiver at the _TAB connector_ and using the same
measurement methodology.
### 8.2.4 AAS BS output power
#### 8.2.4.1 Maximum Output Power
The objectives of defining conducted output power of the AAS BS are to verify
the capabilities of the transmitter to feed antennas and the accuracy of the
maximum output power.
Regulatory review on output power is presented in 3GPP TR 37.840 [2]. The
following summarises regulatory views and requirements for BS employing
_antenna arrays_.
\- No specific limits for AAS BS for terrestrial mobile systems are given in
ITU-R recommendations.
\- For the ECC regulation in Europe there is not output power limit specified
and does not give any additional definitions in the AAS BS area, however there
are several spurious emissions limits and Block Edge Mask requirements which
impact and limit the maximum transmission power.
\- For the FCC regulation in US, it suggests the transmission limits
applicable to the sum at the antenna connectors.
\- For the MIC regulation in Japan, the measurement and calculation method of
output power from multiple outputs:
\- For an adaptive array antenna are given as follows: Measure and sum the
output powers or emissions (which are specified by absolute values in the
technical conditions) of all the antenna connectors. In this case, the output
power of one _array element_ should be configured with the maximum output
power. Then, the output powers of remaining _array element_ s should be
configured as the sum of output powers of all _array element_ s are maximized.
\- For MIMO: Measure the output power or emission on each antenna connector.
Based on the above, the maximum output power is declared for each _TAB
connector_ , the total output power from all _TAB connector(s)_ is then
derived from the sum of those declarations.
The rated multi band total output power per _TAB connector_ ,
P~Rated,MB,TABC~, is the mean power level associated with all bands the
manufacturer has declared to be simultaneously available at the _TAB
connector_ , during the transmitter ON period in a specified reference
condition.
The rated total output power per _TAB connector_ , P~Rated,t,TABC~, is the
mean power level associated with a particular band the manufacturer has
declared to be available at the _TAB connector_ , during the transmitter ON
period in a specified reference condition.
The rated RAT output power per _TAB connector_ , P~Rated,RAT,TABC~, is the
mean power level associated with a particular band and RAT the manufacturer
has declared to be available at the _TAB connector_ , during the transmitter
ON period in a specified reference condition.
The rated carrier output power per _TAB connector_ , P~Rated,c,TABC~, is the
mean power level associated with a particular carrier the manufacturer has
declared to be available at the _TAB connector_ , during the transmitter ON
period in a specified reference condition.
The maximum total output power per _TAB connector_ , P~max,t,TABC~, is the
mean power level measured in a particular band at the array boundary antenna
connector, during the transmitter ON period in a specified reference
condition.
The maximum RAT output power per _TAB connector_ , P~max,RAT,TABC~, is the
mean power level measured in a particular band and RAT at the array boundary
antenna connector, during the transmitter ON period in a specified reference
condition.
The maximum carrier output power per _TAB connector_ , P~max,c,TABC~, is the
mean power level measured on a particular carrier at the array boundary
antenna connector, during the transmitter ON period in a specified reference
condition.
The system power in each case can be calculated by adding the declared or
measured power from each of the _TAB connectors_ :
> P~Rated,t,sys~ - The sum of P~Rated,t,TABC~ for all _TAB connectors_ for a
> particular band
>
> P~Rated,RAT,sys~ - The sum of P~Rated,RAT,TABC~ for all _TAB connectors_ for
> a particular band for a single RAT
>
> P~Rated,c,sys~ - The sum of P~Rated,c,TABC~ for all _TAB connectors_ for a
> single carrier
>
> P~max,t,sys~ - The sum of P~max,t,TABC~ for all _TAB connectors_ for a
> particular band
>
> P~max,RAT,sys~ - The sum of P~max,RAT,TABC~ for all _TAB connectors_ for a
> particular band for a single RAT
>
> P~max,c,sys~ - The sum of P~max,c,TABC~ for all _TAB connectors_ for a
> single carrier
The above represents a complete set of all possible power definitions, any
definitions not needed for requirements do not need to be included in the
specification and are here for information.
AAS BS rated output power requirements are placed on both P~Rated,c,sys~ and
P~Rated,c,TABC~ as specified in table 8.2.4.1-1.
Table 8.2.4.1-1: AAS Base Station rated output power
+------------------------+------------------------+-----------------+ | AAS BS class | P~Rated,c,sys~ | P~Rated,c,TABC~ | +------------------------+------------------------+-----------------+ | Wide Area BS | NOTE 1 | NOTE 1 | +------------------------+------------------------+-----------------+ | Medium Range BS | ≤ 38 dBm | ≤ 38 dBm | | | +10log(N~TXU~) NOTE 2 | | +------------------------+------------------------+-----------------+ | Local Area BS | ≤ 24 dBm | ≤ 24 dBm | | | +10log(N~TXU~) NOTE 2 | | +------------------------+------------------------+-----------------+ | NOTE 1: There is no | | | | upper limit for the | | | | P~Rated,c,sys~ or | | | | P~Rated,c,TABC~ of the | | | | Wide Area BS. | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: N~TXU~ is the | | | | same value used in | | | | subclause 8.2.6 | | | | Unwanted emissions. | | | +------------------------+------------------------+-----------------+
The output power requirement is set on the accuracy of the declared output
power for each _TAB connector_ at the transceiver boundary.
In normal conditions, the AAS BS maximum carrier output power per _TAB
connector_ should remain within +2 dB and ‑2 dB of the rated carrier output
power declared by the manufacturer.
In extreme conditions, the AAS BS maximum carrier output power per _TAB
connector_ should remain within +2.5 dB and -2.5 dB of the rated carrier
output power declared by the manufacturer.
Additional regional requirement may be specified if applicable.
#### 8.2.4.2 Reference/Pilot signal power
There are a number of broadcast messages which have power accuracy
requirements place upon them in addition to the maximum output power
requirement. These are:
\- For UTRA - FDD primary CPICH power, TDD CCPCH power, FDD secondary CPICH
power, MIMO mode and MIMO mode with 4 antenna\'s.
\- For E-UTRA - DL RS power.
The requirements apply to the power level of a code channel (UTRA) or
resources element (E-UTRA). The requirement is applied to the actual power in
the signal compared the intended power which is broadcast on the BCH (UTRA) or
DL_SCH (E-UTRA).
In non-AAS BS systems these requirements are applied to a single antenna
connector 3GPP TS 25.104 [6] and 3GPP TS 36.104 [7].
As there is only a single BCH message per cell if applied to AAS BS a similar
requirement would effectively limit the system to having only a single _TAB
connector_ per cell, this would inhibit many AAS BS features for example it
would prohibit beamforming of these signals. In order to beam form the signals
it is necessary to distribute the power over a number of antenna elements (and
hence _TAB connectors_) and hence the power broadcast on the BCH would
represent the total signal power on all the _TAB connectors_ (in the group
transmitting the signal) not the power on any single _TAB connector_. The
requirement(s) therefore are rephrased to state:
Either:
\- The signal power broadcast on the BCH is compared to the sum of the
reference signal (CPICH, DL RS, etc.) power summed over all the _TAB
connectors_ transmitting the signal.
Or
\- The reference signal (CPICH, DL RS, etc.) power broadcast on the BCH is
multiplied by the fraction of power of that signal declared by the
manufacturer on each _TAB connector_ and compared with the power on the _TAB
connector_ individually.
The net result on the accuracy of the reference signal is the same in both
cases so both should be possible. Information about _TAB connector_ groups or
the distribution of the reference signals are provided by vendor declaration.
The same accuracy level as the non-AAS BS requirements can be applied.
### 8.2.5 Transmitter intermodulation
#### 8.2.5.1 General
Traditionally the transmitter intermodulation requirement was created to
guarantee emission levels in a co-location scenario. The requirement is based
on robustness against injection of a reverse interference signal from a co-
located BS. For AAS BS reverse interference signals can be caused by intra-
system coupling.
Therefore two types of transmitter intermodulation scenarios have been
identified for AAS BS:
1) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
from a co-located BS, and this is analogous to the existing transmitter
intermodulation requirement in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6], 3GPP TS 25.105 [9], 3GPP TS
36.104 [7] and 3GPP TS 37.104 [8].
2) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
determined by the sum of the co-channel leakage power coupled via the combined
RDN and antenna array within the AAS BS.
Both scenarios are be captured in the AAS BS specification by the transmitter
intermodulation requirement, where a reverse interference signal is feed to
_TAB connector_ , while maintaining emission levels.
The co-location transmitter intermodulation test is considered sufficient if
it represents the greatest interference power at the tested _TAB connector_.
Intra-system AAS transmitter intermodulation is only be tested where the
maximum leakage power at the _transceiver unit_ connector exceeds the
interference signal power level at the _TAB connector_ determined for co-
location transmitter intermodulation.
Figure 8.2.5.1-1: Set-up for testing transmitter intermodulation on one _TAB
connector_
#### 8.2.5.2 Co-location transmitter intermodulation
In non-AAS BS the transmitter intermodulation requirement is to address the
coexistence between the transmitter from one operator and the transmitter from
another operator in case they are co-located with assumption that the coupling
loss between them is 30 dB. The requirement assumes that they transmit the
same level of power, and the transmitted signals are adjacent to each other in
the frequency domain. It is proposed to apply the existing non-AAS BS
requirements specified at the antenna connector for non-AAS BS to each _TAB
connector_ at the transceiver array boundary for AAS BS. The wanted signal
power level is the rated total output power of each _TAB connector,_
P~Rated,t,TABC~ and the interference signal power level is 30 dB below the
wanted signal.
The interfering signal is defined in the same way as for the non-AAS BS
requirement.
The transmitter intermodulation emission level caused by the interference from
co-located BS should not exceed the unwanted emission limits of the AAS BS
transmitter spurious emissions requirement, the AAS BS operating band unwanted
emission requirement and AAS ACLR requirements in the presence of the
interfering signal defined above.
#### 8.2.5.3 Intra AAS BS transmitter intermodulation
In an AAS BS there could be coupling effects occurring in the RDN and the
_antenna array_ , which potentially can generate reverse interferers and
consequently unwanted emissions due to intermodulation. In this case, the
central frequencies of the transmitted signals are aligned in frequency
domain, and they could transmit the same level of power.
The wanted signal and the interfering signal in a corresponding test would
thus be within the bandwidth of the same carriers. The wanted signal and the
interfering signal would have the same waveform characteristics, but they
would be non-coherent. The wanted signal for intra AAS BS transmitter
intermodulation testing is the same as the one defined for co-location
transmitter intermodulation.
The transmitter intermodulation emission level caused by intra AAS BS
interfering signal should not exceed the unwanted emission limits of the AAS
BS operating band unwanted emission requirement and AAS ACLR requirement in
the presence of the interference signal declared by the manufacturer as
described below.
The manufacturer declares one of the following options:
\- The maximum interference signal level for testing equal to the maximum
intra array leakage power for each _TAB connector_ in the transceiver array
boundary for each operating band supported by that _TAB connector_.
\- The maximum interference signal level for testing equal to the leakage
power of the _TAB connector_ experiencing the most leakage power in the array
to be applied for all _TAB connectors_.
The maximum leakage power at each _TAB connector_ at the transceiver array
boundary is the sum of the co-channel leakage power coupled via the combined
RDN and _antenna array_ from all the other _TAB connectors_ , but does not
comprise power radiated from the _antenna array_ and reflected back from the
environment. All _TAB connectors_ should be transmitting at P~Rated,c,TABC~.
The manufacturer can estimate the maximum leakage power at each _TAB
connector_ at the Transceiver Array Boundary by measurements and calculation.
Measurement does not have to include all _TAB connectors_ provided that the
level of leakage power from the excluded _TAB connectors_ have no impact on
the estimated maximum leakage power.
### 8.2.6 Unwanted emissions
In non-AAS BS, the unwanted emissions are specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 [6],
3GPP TS 25.105 [9], 3GPP TS 36.104 [7] and 3GPP TS 37.104 [8] and apply per
_TAB connector_. The AAS BS has a TRXUA consisting of many _transceiver units_
which will be equal to, or potentially much higher than the number of non-AAS
BS transmitter antenna connectors in a non-AAS BS with comparable
functionality. As there is no upper limit on the number of _transceiver units_
and associated _TAB connectors_ that an AAS BS system has, it is important to
set the total unwanted emissions limits to an amount equivalent to Rel-13 non-
AAS BS.
The total unwanted emissions from the AAS BS should be no higher than the
unwanted emissions from a non-AAS BS conforming to the Rel-13 specifications
with either the same number of transmitter units as the AAS BS or a maximum of
8 transmitter units.
Unwanted and spurious emissions are specified with a corresponding measurement
bandwidth in the core specifications.
_The manufacturer declares the minimum supported number of cells (i.e.
geographical areas). The minimum number of supported cells (N~cells~) relates
to the AAS BS setting with the minimum amount of cell splitting. The
manufacturer also declares TAB connector TX min cell groups. A TAB connector
TX min cell group is a group of TAB connectors that are responsible for
transmitting in a cell when the AAS BS setting corresponding to the declared
minimum number of cells is active. All TAB connectors for a band should belong
to a TAB connector TX min cell groups. The mapping of TAB connectors to cells
is implementation dependent and is subject to manufacturer declaration._
_The emission limit of an AAS BS is defined as the emission limits specified
in 3GPP TS_ 25.104 [6], _3GPP TS_ 25.105 [9], _3GPP TS_ 36.104 [7] and _3GPP
TS_ 37.104 [8] multiplied by _N~TXU,counted~, where N~TXU,counted~ is the
scaling factor defined by:_
N~TXU,counted~ _= min(number of active transmitter units, 8*N~cells~)_ for
E-UTRA and MSR (except UTRA only MSR)
_and_
N~TXU,counted~ = min(number of active transmitter units,4*N~cells~) for UTRA
and UTRA only MSR
The emission limit for each _TAB connector TX min cell group is equal to the
emission limits of an AAS BS specified above divided by N~cells~. The
requirements are to meet the emission limits per TAB connector TX min cell
group._
The number of _active transmitter units_ is the number of transmitter units
which are ON, and have the ability to send parallel and distinct modulated
data streams to the _TAB connectors_ at the transceiver array boundary.
It is captured in the core specification that the compliance to the
requirement can be shown as either:
\- the unwanted emissions power at each _TAB connector_ should be less than or
equal to the emissions limit as defined above scaled by -10log~10~(_n_), where
_n_ is the number of _TAB connectors_ in the _TAB connector TX min cell group_
; or
\- the sum of the emissions power measured on each _TAB connector_ in the _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ should be less than or equal to the emissions
limit as defined above.
The fixed attribute of 8 in the scaling factor _N~TXU~_ is based on the
maximum number of layers/streams specified in 3GPP Rel-12 specifications. The
scaling function may be further reconsidered for future releases if the
maximum number of layers/streams supported is changed.
### 8.2.7 TDD transmitter OFF power
TDD transmitter OFF power requirements are applicable for UTRA and E-UTRA TDD
systems. In both cases, the non AAS BS requirement consists of two components:
1) A maximum time interval of 17μs for the transmitter output power to move
from the transmitter ON level and the OFF level or from the transmitter OFF
level to the transmitter ON level.
2) A maximum transmitter output power level of -85 dBm during uplink
subframes.
The TDD transmitter OFF power requirement serves two purposes:
1) Prevention of de-sensitization of the TDD receiver due to transmitter
leakage.
2) Prevention of interference to other sites during UL periods.
The transmitter OFF power level is driven by the first of these issues; (i.e.
prevention of de-sensitization of the receiver), whereas the time limit
ensures that interference towards other sites is at a sufficiently low level
before the start of the UL period.
It has been agreed that the OTA sensitivity conformance test for TDD will
include an appropriate test model and test level. This means that the OTA
sensitivity requirement is able to capture any desensitization effects arising
from the transmitter.
In the Rel-13 specification, a minimum declarable level for OTA sensitivity
has not been set. However, if in a future release a minimum OTA sensitivity
level is present, then the purpose of the TDD transmitter OFF requirement will
be entirely related to prevention of inter-site interference. In such a case,
the transmitter OFF level could be revised to reflect the needs of the inter-
site interference scenario only.
## 8.3 Receiver
### 8.3.1 General
Provisions for conducted verification of base station receivers with multiple
receivers are present in the core requirement and conformance specifications
3GPP TS 25.104 [6], 3GPP TS 25.105 [9], 3GPP TS 36.104 [7] and 3GPP TS 37.104
[8]. The simulation results presented in clause 5 and analyses show that
applying the existing per receiver requirements to each receive _TAB
connector_ of an AAS BS is consistent with the multiple receiver requirements
captured in the requirements specifications for non-AAS BS, for the AAS BS
deployment scenarios and AAS BS structure that can be represented by the
scenarios and structure simulated and studied. These requirements are
therefore judged adequate for conducted verification of AAS BS receivers in
these and similar scenarios.
The requirements placed on the receive _TAB connectors_ are hence based on
those from the non-AAS BS requirements [6], [9], [7] and [8].
### 8.3.2 Reference sensitivity level
The minimum sensitivity requirements for the AAS BS are specified to
correspond to the received signal power at the transceiver array boundary
using same reference measurement channels and reference sensitivity power
levels for the target throughputs as the non-AAS BS sensitivity requirements
in [6], [9], [7] and [8].
Fixed conducted reference sensitivity requirements per receiver unit connector
could lead to overall sensitivity being over dimensioned for some AAS BS with
large antenna apertures.
For AAS BS in Rel-13, it has been decided that it is acceptable to keep the
Rel-13 non-AAS BS conducted reference sensitivity requirement and apply it per
receive _TAB connector_ at the transceiver array boundary.
### 8.3.3 Dynamic range
The minimum dynamic range requirements for the AAS BS are specified to
correspond to a wanted signal power and an interfering signal power at the
transceiver array boundary using the same: interfering signal types,
interfering signal power levels, wanted signal power levels, and test
configurations for target throughputs as the non-AAS BS dynamic range
requirements in [6], [9], [7] and [8].
### 8.3.4 In-channel sensitivity
The minimum in-channel sensitivity requirements for the AAS BS are specified
to correspond to the wanted signal power and interfering signal power at the
transceiver array boundary using the same: interfering signal type,
interfering signal power levels, wanted signal power levels, and test
configuration for target throughputs as the non-AAS BS in‑channel sensitivity
requirements in [6], [9], [7] and [8].
### 8.3.5 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) and narrow-band blocking
The minimum ACS requirements for the AAS BS are specified to correspond to the
wanted signal power and adjacent channel signal power at the transceiver array
boundary using the same: adjacent channel signal types, interfering signal
power levels, wanted signal power levels, and test configuration for target
throughputs as the non‑AAS BS adjacent channel selectivity requirements in
[6], [9], [7] and [8].
### 8.3.6 Blocking
#### 8.3.6.1 General
The minimum blocking requirements for the AAS BS are specified to correspond
to the wanted signal power and blocking signal power at the transceiver array
boundary using the same: blocking signal types, interfering signal power
levels, wanted signal power levels, and test configurations for target
throughputs as the non-AAS BS blocking requirements in [6], [9], [7] and [8].
#### 8.3.6.2 Co-location with other base stations
Additional minimum co-location blocking requirements may be specified for the
AAS BS receiver in co-location situation at corresponding to the coupling
levels, wanted and blocking signal powers at the transceiver boundary using
the same blocking signal types, interfering signal power levels, wanted signal
power levels, and test configurations in [6], [9], [7] and [8].
### 8.3.7 Receiver spurious emissions
The minimum spurious emissions requirements for the AAS BS are specified to
correspond to permissible emissions levels at the transceiver boundary using
the same test configurations as the non-AAS BS spurious emissions requirements
in [6], [9], [7] and [8].
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver unit (RXU) that appear at the receiver _TAB
connector_. The receiver spurious emissions requirements apply to all
receiver/_transceiver units_ with separate RX and TX _TAB connectors_. In this
case for FDD AAS BS the receiver spurious emissions test are performed when
all TXU and RXU are ON, with the transmit _TAB connectors_ terminated.
For TDD AAS BS _TAB connectors_ common to RXU and TXU the requirement applies
during the transmitter OFF period. For FDD AAS BS _TAB connectors_ common to
RXU and TXU the transmitter spurious emission limits as specified in subclause
8.2.6 are valid.
_The manufacturer declares TAB connector RX min cell groups. A TAB connector
RX min cell group is a group of RX TAB connectors that are responsible for
receiving a cell when the AAS BS setting corresponding to the minimum number
of cells is active. All TAB connectors for a band should belong to a TAB
connector RX min cell group. The mapping of TAB connectors to cells is
implementation dependent and is subject to manufacturer declaration._
The total receiver spurious emissions limits for the AAS BS are specified such
that the power sum of emissions from all RX _TAB connectors_ , in a particular
band to correspond to the receiver spurious emissions limits in [6], [9], [7]
and [8], multiplied by N~RXU,counted~.
N~RXU,counted~ is given by:
N~RXU,counted~ = _min(number of active receiver units, 8 * N~cells~)_ for
E-UTRA and MSR (excluding UTRA only MSR)
N~RXU,counted~ = _min(number of active receiver units, 4 * N~cells~)_ for
single RAT UTRA and UTRA only MSR
_N~cells~_ is defined in subclause 8.2.66. The number of active receiver units
is the same as the [number of receive diversity branches] to which compliance
is declared for chapter 8 performance requirements.
The spurious emission limit for each _TAB connector RX min cell group is equal
to the spurious emission limits of an AAS BS specified above divided by
N~cells~. The requirements are to meet the emissions limit per TAB connector
RX min cell group._
It is captured in the AAS BS core specification that the compliance to the
receiver spurious emissions requirement can be shown as either:
1) the unwanted emissions power at each RX _TAB connector_ should be less than
or equal to the emissions limit as defined above scaled by -10log10(n), where
n is the number of RX _TAB connectors_ in the _TAB connector RX min cell
group_ with the operating band; or
2) the sum of the emissions power measured on each RX _TAB connector_ in the
_TAB connector RX min cell group_ with the operating band should be less than
or equal to the emissions limit as defined above.
The fixed attribute of 8 in the scaling factor N~RXU,counted~ is based on the
TX spurious emissions limit, which is based upon consideration of the maximum
number of layers/streams specified in release 12 of 3GPP specifications. The
scaling function may be further reconsidered for future releases if the
maximum number of layers/streams is changed.
### 8.3.8 Receiver Intermodulation
The minimum receiver intermodulation requirements are specified to correspond
to the wanted signal power and interfering signal power at the transceiver
array boundary using the same interfering signal types, interfering signal
power levels, wanted signal power levels, and test configurations in [6], [9],
[7] and [8].

# 10 Conformance testing aspects
## 10.1 Conformance testing framework
### 10.1.1 General
For conducted test requirements, it is expected that one test method will be
sufficient for each core requirement. Hence the traditional approach for
devising test specifications can be followed. This is depicted in figure
10.1.1-1.
Figure 10.1.1-1: Conducted requirement to test mapping
The following 11 points have been agreed as a framework for developing OTA
test.
1) Multiple test methods may exist for each requirement
2) Each test method will require its own test procedure.
3) A single conformance requirement applies for each core requirement,
regardless of test procedure.
4) Common maximum accepted test system uncertainty applies for all test
methods addressing the same test requirement. Test methods producing
significantly worse uncertainty than others at comparable cost should not
impact the common maximum accepted test system uncertainty assessment.
5) Common test tolerances apply for all test methods addressing the same test
requirement.
6) A common way of establishing the uncertainty result from all test methods\'
individual budgets is established.
7) A common method of making an uncertainty budget (not a common uncertainty
budget) is established.
8) Establish budget format examples for each addressed test method in the form
of lists of uncertainty contributions. Contributions that may be negligible
with some DUT and substantial with others should be in this list. For each
combination of measurement method and test parameter (EIRP or EIS) develop a
list with measurement uncertainties.
9) Describe potential OTA test methods relevant for testing radiated transmit
power and OTA sensitivity. The description requires information about the test
range architecture and test procedure. Addressing each item in each
uncertainty budget with respect to the expected distribution of the errors,
the mechanism creating the error and how it interacts with properties of the
DUT.
10) Providing example uncertainty budgets in the TS will be useful in order to
demonstrate the way a budget should be defined and how calculating its
resulting measurement uncertainty is done, but the figures used in the
examples will clearly be only examples and not applicable in general.
11) Each test instance may require an individual uncertainty budget applicable
for the combination of the test facility, the DUT and the test procedure and
property tested. Here, the tester demonstrates that the uncertainty
requirement is fulfilled during the conformance testing.
The linking of core requirements via test methods to conformance requirements
is depicted in figure 10.1.1-2.

### 10.1.2 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
Uncertainty contributions listed in subclause 10.3 with descriptions in the
annex B need to be calculated to provide an overall total measurement
uncertainty for each OTA test method for the accompanying conformance
requirement.
The uncertainty tables are presented with two stages in mind:
\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna (for example a
standard gain horn) whose absolute gain is known at the frequencies of
measurement
\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the transmitter or
receiver (depending on EIRP or EIS measurement) is performed.
The final uncertainty budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:
1) The uncertainty source,
2) Uncertainty value,
3) Distribution of the probability,
4) Divisor based on distribution shape,
5) Sensitivity coefficient _c~i~_ and its calculated standard uncertainty
_u~i~_ (based on uncertainty value, divisor and sensitivity coefficient
_c~i~_).
NOTE: All measurement uncertainty contributions are assumed independent, log
and small, hence the errors induced by taking values in log are negligible.
The calculation of the uncertainty contribution is based on the ISO Guide [25]
to the expression of uncertainty in measurement. Each individual uncertainty
is expressed by its standard deviation (termed as 'standard uncertainty') and
represented by symbol _u~i~_.
The procedure for forming the uncertainty budget can be as follows:
1) Compile lists of individual uncertainty contributions for EIRP/EIS
measurement both in Stage 1 and Stage 2.
2) Determine the standard uncertainty of each contribution _u~i~_ by:
a) Determining the distribution of the uncertainty (i.e. Gaussian, U-shaped,
rectangular, or exponentially normal).
b) Determining the maximum value of each uncertainty (unless the distributions
is Gaussian).
c) Calculating the standard uncertainty by dividing the uncertainty by
{width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} if the
distribution is U-shaped, by 2 if the distribution exponentially normal and by
{width="0.25in" height="0.25in"} if the distribution is rectangular.
d) Multiplying the standard uncertainty by the sensitivity coefficient _c~i.~_
3) Convert the units into decibel, if necessary.
4) Combine all the standard uncertainties by the Root of the Sum of the
Squares (RSS) method.
5) Combine the uncertainties in Stage 1 and Stage 2 into the combined
uncertainty _u~c~_ also by the RSS method:
{width="2.5833333333333335in" height="0.2916666666666667in"}.
6) Multiply the result of the combined uncertainty _u~c~_ by an expansion
factor of 1.96 to derive expanded uncertainty _u~e~_ at 95 % confidence level:
_u~e~_ = 1.96 _u~c~_
## 10.2 Conducted tests
The conducted measurement uncertainty values and test tolerance values are the
same as those for non-AAS BS, as specified in 3GPP TS 25.141 [10] for UTRA
FDD, 3GPP TS 25.142 [11] for UTRA TDD and 3GPP TS 36.141 [12] for E-UTRA.
## 10.3 OTA tests
### 10.3.1 Radiated transmit power
#### 10.3.1.1 Test methods
##### 10.3.1.1.1 General
The radiated measurement methods for AAS BS conformance test, also known as
over the air (OTA) test methods, include the antenna performance into the
requirements measurement. In principle, the methods being discussed are:
\- Indoor Anechoic Chamber
\- Compact Antenna Test Range
\- One Dimensional Compact Range Chamber
\- Near Field Test Range
These methods are described in detail in the following subclauses, including
the explanation of the method, the measurement procedure and the uncertainty
budget.
##### 10.3.1.1.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber
##### 10.3.1.1.2.1 Description {#description .H6}
This method measures the EIRP in an anechoic chamber with the separation
between the manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point of the AAS
BS and the phase centre of the receiving antenna of no less than 2D^2^/λ,
where D is the largest dimension of the antenna of AAS BS and λ is the
wavelength. The measurement system setup is as depicted in figure
10.3.1.1.2.1-1.

##### 10.3.1.1.2.2 Test Method limitations and scope {#test-method-
limitations-and-scope .H6}
The maximum size of the DUT is a chamber restriction that would affect the
quality of the quiet zone. For larger DUT sizes larger size chambers should be
considered such that the uncertainty of the quiet zone is taken into account.
##### 10.3.1.1.2.3 Procedure {#procedure .H6}
The test consists of two stages: the calibration and the measurement. The test
procedure is as follows.
{width="5.508333333333334in" height="5.163194444444445in"}
Figure 10.3.1.1.2.3-1: Indoor Anechoic Chamber calibration system setup for
EIRP
**Stage 1 - Calibration:**
1) Connect the reference antenna and the receiving antenna to the measurement
RF out port and RF in port of the network analyzer, respectively, as shown in
figure 10.3.1.1.2.3-1.
2) Install the reference antenna with its _beam peak direction_ and the height
of its phase centre aligned with the receiving antenna.
3) Set the centre frequency of the network analyzer to the carrier centre
frequency of the tested signal for EIRP measurement of AAS BS and measure
LF~EIRP,\ E→D~ , which is equivalent to 20log\|S21\| (dB) obtained by the
network analyzer:
\- LF~EIRP,\ E→D~: Pathloss between E and D in figure 10.3.1.1.2.3-1.
4) Measure the cable loss, LF~EIRP,\ E→F~ between the reference antenna
connector and the network analyzer connector:
\- LF~EIRP,\ E→F~: Cable loss between E and F in figure 10.3.1.2.3-1.
5) Calculate the calibration value between A and D with the following formula:
\- L~EIRP_cal,\ A→D~ = LF~EIRP,\ E→D~ + G~REF_ANT_EIRP,\ A→F~ -LF~EIRP,\ E→F~.
\- L~EIRP_cal,\ A→D~: Calibration value between A and D in figure
10.3.1.1.2.3-1.
\- G~REF_ANT_EIRP,\ A→F~: Antenna gain of the reference antenna.
**Stage 2 - Measurement:**
6) Uninstall the reference antenna and install the AAS BS with the
manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as
the phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer declared
coordinate system orientation of the AAS BS is set to be aligned with the
testing system.
7) Set the AAS BS to generate the tested beam with the _beam peak direction_
intended to be the same as the testing direction.
8) Rotate the AAS BS to make the testing direction aligned with the direction
of the receiving antenna.
9) Set the AAS BS to transmit the test signal at the maximum power according
to E-TM1.1.
10) Measure the mean power for each carrier arriving at the measurement
equipment connector, denoted by P~R_AAS_EIRP,\ D~:
\- P~R_AAS_EIRP,\ D~: Measured mean power for each carrier at the measurement
equipment connector at D in figure 10.3.1.1.2.3-1.
11) Calculate the EIRP with the following formula:
EIRP = P~R_AAS_EIRP,\ D~+ L~EIRP_cal,\ A→D~
12) Repeat the above steps 7)\~17) per conformance test _beam direction pair_.

etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for both stages,
the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant  0.00 dB value.
In other cases a technical study should be done.
**B1-17 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the reference antenna**
This contribution originates from the gain/efficiency uncertainty of
calibration antenna that is employed in Stage 2 only. This uncertainty value
will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s data in logs with a rectangular
distribution, unless otherwise informed. This uncertainty value can be found
in Annex E and was a result of compromised value in order to align all test
methods having this uncertainty contribution.
**B1-18 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the receiving antenna**
The uncertainty appears in both stages and it is thus considered systematic
and constant  0.00 dB value.
# B.2 Compact Antenna Test Range
**B2-1 Misalignment DUT/calibration antenna & pointing error**
This contribution denotes uncertainty in DUT/calibration antenna alignment and
DUT/calibration antenna pointing error. In this measurement the
DUT/calibration antenna is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a zero
contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums
to align, this contribution can be a small contribution. The calibration
antenna\'s phase centre and polarization purity changes slightly according to
the frequency. Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this.
To ensure that the point error is at a minimal, this contribution should be
captured using the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the
DUT this would most likely be in the azimuth domain).
**B2-2 Measurement Receiver: uncertainty of the absolute level**
The receiving device used to measure the received signal level in the EIRP
tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level. These receiving
devices to name a few are spectrum analyzers, network analyzers or power
meter. These devices will have an uncertainty contribution of their own; this
value declared by the test gear vendor should be recorded as this uncertainty
contribution. If a power meter is used then both measurement uncertainty and
out of band noise is considered as part of the contribution. This uncertainty
value can be found in Annex E and was a result of compromised value in order
to align all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.
**B2-3 Standing wave between DUT and test range antenna**
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between DUT and test range antenna. This
value can be captured by moving the DUT towards the test range antenna as the
standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in measured gain.
**B2-4 RF leakage (SGH connector terminated & test range antenna connector
cable terminated)**
This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between SGH/reference antenna
and transmitting equipment.
**B2-5 QZ ripple DUT/calibration antenna**
This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the AAS BS/calibration
antenna during the measurement or calibration phase. The purpose of this
component is to capture the contributions that the reflections from the walls,
roof and floor that will add to the EIRP measurement. The sum of all these
reflections from the walls, range reflector (if applicable), roof and floor
will give the overall value for the QZ ripple. In other words, the uncertainty
component from the wall will not be separated from the roof or the floor. The
purpose of this uncertainty component is to capture the overall reflections
from the chamber walls experienced by the AAS BS/calibration antenna. To
capture the full effect of the QZ ripple a distance of 1λ should be measured
from each of the AAS BS/calibration antenna physical aperture edges, i.e.
total QZ distance = physical aperture length +2 λ, to ensure the full volume
of the QZ is captured in the uncertainty measurement.
**B2-6 Uncertainty of network analyser**
**a) drift (temp, oscillators, filters, etc.) start-to-end time of
measurements.**
This uncertainty includes all the uncertainties involved in the S~21~
measurement (including drift and frequency flatness) with a network analyzer,
and will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs. This uncertainty
also includes analyzer uncertainty for multi-polarization (2 or more ports)
measured simultaneously. This uncertainty value can be found in Annex E and
was a result of compromised value in order to align all test methods having
this uncertainty contribution.
**B2-7 Mismatch of receiver chain (i.e. between receiving antenna and
measurement receiver)**
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver equipment.
This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the S~11~ towards
the receive antenna and also towards the test receiver. The mismatch between
the antenna reflection and the receiver reflection can also be calculated. If
the same cable is used for calibration Stage 1, this can be considered
systematic and negligible.
**B2-8 Insertion loss of receiver chain**
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the measurement
stage. Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be calculated by taking the
measurement of the cable where port 2 is the end of the cable connected to the
AAS BS or calibration antenna.
IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB
**B2-9 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable**
**a) Flexing cables, adapters, attenuators, extra pathloss cable & connector
repeatability.**
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This
is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary
joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as the
uncertainty.
**B2-10 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna**
This uncertainty consists of the uncertainty of the gain value associated with
the gain value denoted from the antenna calibration. This uncertainty value
can be found in Annex E and was a result of compromised value in order to
align all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.
**B2-11 Misalignment positioning system**
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to maximum this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
**B2-12 Rotary Joints**
If applicable the contribution of this uncertainty the accuracy in changing
from azimuth to vertical measurements.
**B2-14 Miscellaneous Uncertainty**
The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the unknown,
unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP measurements. This
term should include truly random effects as well as systematic uncertainties,
such as that arising from dissimilarity between the patterns of the reference
antenna (SGH) and the DUT.
**B2-15 Switching Uncertainty**
The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically different
RF path to different measurement instruments of different measurement modes.
The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the errors arising from manual
switching work. Switching is also used to measure the path loss values of each
polarization component. Even though the electromechanical switching is
preferable during path loss and antenna performance measurements, some minor
uncertainties can occur when the switch states are programmed to change their
polarity.
# B.3 One Dimensional Compact Range
**B3-1 Misalignment DUT and pointing error**
This contribution denotes uncertainty in DUT alignment and DUT pointing error.
In this measurement the DUT is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a zero
contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums
to align, this contribution can be a small contribution. The reference
antenna´s phase centre and polarization purity changes slightly according to
the frequency. Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this.
To ensure that the pointing error is at a minimal, this contribution should be
captured using the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the
DUT this would most likely be in the azimuth domain).
**B3-2 Standing wave between DUT and test range antenna**
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between DUT and test range antenna. This
value can be captured by moving the DUT towards the test range antenna as the
standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in measured gain.
**B3-3 Quiet zone ripple DUT/reference antenna**
This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the DUT/reference antenna
during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is to capture the
contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof and floor that will
add to the EIRP measurement. The sum of all these reflections from the walls,
range reflector (if applicable), roof and floor will give the overall value
for the QZ ripple. In other words, the uncertainty component from the wall
will not be separated from the roof or the floor. The purpose of this
uncertainty component is to capture the overall reflections from the chamber
walls experienced by the DUT/reference antenna. To capture the full effect of
the QZ ripple a distance of 1λ must be measured from each of the DUT/reference
antenna physical aperture edges, i.e. total QZ distance = physical aperture
length + 2 λ, to ensure the full volume of the QZ is captured in the
uncertainty measurement.
**B3-4 Phase curvature**
This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of AAS BS/reference antenna.
**B3-5 Polarization mismatch between DUT/reference antenna and receiving
antenna**
This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between the
DUT/reference antenna and the receiving antenna.
**B3-6 Mutual coupling between DUT/reference antenna and receiving antenna**
This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the DUT/reference
antenna and the receiving antenna. Mutual coupling degrades not just the
antenna efficiency, i. e. the EIRP value, but it can alter the antenna's
radiation pattern as well. For compact range chamber, usually the spacing
between the DUT/reference antenna and the receiving antennas is large enough
so that the level of mutual coupling might be negligible.
**B3-7 Measurement equipment**
This contribution originates from limited absolute level accuracy and non-
linearity of the measurement equipment. The measurement equipment such as a BS
simulator, spectrum analyser, or power meter measures the received signal
level in EIRP tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level. The
uncertainty value will be indicated in the manufacturer's data sheet in logs.
**B3-8 Impedance mismatch in receiving chain**
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the receiving
antenna and the measurement equipment. The multiple reflections can produce an
overall reflection that depends not only upon the individual reflections of
each part but their reflective interactions as well. The combination loss by
the overall reflection can be higher or lower than individual loss by multiple
reflections. The combination loss is called the mismatch error and leads to
the measurement uncertainty.
**B3-9 RF leakage (DUT/SGH connector terminated and test range antenna
connector cable terminated)**
This contribution denotes noise leaking into connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between SGH/reference antenna
and transmitting equipment.
**B3-10 Misalignment positioning system**
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to maximum this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
**B3-11 Pointing error between reference antenna and test range antenna**
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the _beam peak direction_ of the receiving antenna due to imperfect
rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and
vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the
beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a
larger measurement error for a narrower beam.
**B3-12 Impedance mismatch in path to reference antenna**
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the reference
antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate calibration, the
measurement equipment may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the
error still happens between the reference antenna feed cable and the reference
antenna.
**B3-13 Impedance mismatch in path to compact probe**
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the receiving
antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate calibration, the
measurement equipment may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the
error still happens between the receiving antenna feed cable and the receiving
antenna.
**B3-14 Influence of reference antenna feed cable (flexing cables, adapters,
attenuators, connector repeatability)**
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the reference antenna
and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This is
assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary joints.
The largest difference between the results is recorded as the uncertainty.
**B3-15 Mismatch of receiver chain (i.e. between receiving antenna and
measurement equipment)**
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver equipment.
This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the S~11~ towards
the receive antenna and also towards the test receiver. The mismatch between
the antenna reflection and the receiver reflection can also be calculated. If
the same cable is used for calibration stage, this can be considered
systematic and negligible.
**B3-16 Insertion loss of receiver chain**
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration and the measurement stage, the uncertainty
is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the measurement stage.
Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be calculated by taking the
measurement of the cable where port 2 is the end of the cable connected to the
DUT or reference antenna.

ratio should be determined or measured at the AAS BS location. The noise level
is usually measured with a Spectrum Analyzer. This uncertainty is assumed to
have a Gaussian distribution.
**B4-9 Leakage and Crosstalk**

phase errors so that the relative importance should be determined. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**B4-10 Amplitude non-Linearity**
This uncertainty is the linearity of the receiver used for the measurement. It
can be taken from the data sheet of the receiver.

cables and reflection coefficients. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.

measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**B4-14 Probe pattern knowledge**

in near field can be corrected when performing the near field to far field
transform. There is no direct dependence between the AAS BS pattern and the
probe pattern in near field measurements. This uncertainty is assumed to have
a Gaussian distribution.
**B4-15 Multiple reflections**
The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna and re-
reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving antenna. This
uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of the AAS BS when at
different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
**B4-16 Room scattering**
As for the multiple reflections, a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected by either the absorbers or other structures in the measurement
anechoic chamber before being received by the receiving antenna. This effect
can be isolated from the multiple reflections by testing the AAS BS in
different positions, separated by λ/4 with respect to the anechoic chamber and
comparing these measurements with the reference. This uncertainty is assumed
to have a Gaussian distribution.
**B4-17 DUT support scattering**
This is the uncertainty due to the AAS BS supporting structure on the signal
level. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

by comparing the measurement result when scanning the full area. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**B4-19 Sampling point offset**
This uncertainty has an influence in near field and far field. It is assumed
to have a Gaussian distribution.
**B4-20 Mode truncation**
The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical modes. The
number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering effect generated
by the finite number of modes can improve measurement results by removing
signals from outside the physical area of the AAS BS. Care should be taken in
order to make sure the removed signals are not from the AAS BSitself. This
uncertainty is usually negligible.
**B4-21 Positioning**
The relative position of the probe array is not ideal. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a rectangular distribution.
**B4-22 Probe array uniformity**
This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used for
each physical position. Different probes have different radiation patterns.
Generally, the probe array is calibrated so that the uniformity of the probes
is achieved.
**B4-23 Mismatch of receiver chain**
If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the probe
antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00 dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and should be measured or determined by the method described in [14].
This uncertainty is assumed to have a U-shaped distribution
**B4-24 Insertion loss of receiver chain**
It is composed of the following:
\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable.
\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna attenuator (if used).
\- Insertion loss of RF relays (if used).
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant

The expanded uncertainty is the Root Square Sum (RSS) of the standard
uncertainties for each uncertainty contributors. Each uncertainty can be taken
from the instrument data sheet and is assumed to have a uniform distribution.
This uncertainty value can be found in Annex E and was a result of compromised
value in order to align all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.
**B4-27 Measurement Repeatability - Positioning Repeatability**

It can be addressed by repeating the corresponding measurement 5 times.
Calculate the standard deviation of the metric obtained and use that as the
measurement uncertainty. For tests that require multiple setups, the worst-
case standard deviation is used. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.

of compromised value in order to align all test methods having this
uncertainty contribution.
**B.4-29 Mismatch of receiver chain**
If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the probe
antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00 dB value.
If it is not the case, each uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and should be measured or determined and then taking the total of all
non-zero mismatch uncertainty contribution from all parts by root-sum-squares
(RSS) method. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**B4-31 Mismatch in the connection of the calibration antenna**
This is the uncertainty from the mismatch in the connection between the system
coax cable and the calibration antenna. This uncertainty is from the mismatch
between the cable and the reference antenna that is used for calibration. It
is determined by the S~11~ of the reference antenna and the S~11~ of the cable
to which the antenna is connected i.e if using an SGH antenna for calibration
and 10dB pad is inserted on the cable connecting to the antenna this
uncertainty contribution can be considered negligible. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a U-shaped distribution.
**B4-32 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable**
This uncertainty is due to the impact of the feeding cable on the radiation
properties of the calibration antenna. In case of using either a standard horn
or standard gain horn, the impact of the cable is to be considered negligible
thus the uncertainty  0.00 dB value. In case of using a dipole-like antenna,
the uncertainty should be addressed by measuring this impact. This uncertainty
is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

###### ### Annex C: OTA sensitivity measurement error contribution
descriptions
# C.1 Indoor Anechoic Chamber
**C1-1 Positioning misalignment between the AAS BS and the reference antenna**
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the manufacturer
declared coordinate system reference point of the AAS BS and the phase centre
of the reference antenna. The uncertainty makes the space propagation loss
between the AAS BS and the transmitting antenna at the DUT measurement stage
(i.e. Stage 2) different from the space propagation loss between the reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna at the calibration stage (i.e. Stage 1).
**C1-2 Pointing misalignment between the AAS BS and the transmitting antenna**
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the _beam peak direction_ of the transmitting antenna due to imperfect
rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and
vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the
beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a
larger measurement error for a narrower beam.
**C1-3 Quality of quiet zone**
This contribution originates from a reflectivity level of an anechoic chamber.
The reflectivity level is determined from the average standard deviation of
the electric field in the quiet zone. By repeating a free space VSWR
measurement in 15-degree grid in elevation and azimuth, 264 standard deviation
values in both polarizations are determined. From these values an average
standard deviation of electric field in the quiet zone can be calculated from
the equation:
$\overline{S_{\text{freq}}} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n =
1}^{N}{\sum_{m = 1}^{M}{s_{n,m,\text{hor}}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})} +
\frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}{\sum_{m =
1}^{M}{s_{n,m,\text{ver}}\text{sin}(\theta_{n})}}}}{2}$
where:
$N$ is the number of angular intervals in elevation,
$M$ is the number of angular intervals in azimuth, and
$\theta_{n}$ is elevation of single measurement $s_{n,m,\text{pol}}$.
If an efficiency calibration with omni-directional calibration antenna is
performed, the effect of reflectivity level decreases in Stage 1 (i.e.
calibration measurement) and $\overline{S_{\text{freq}}}$ may be divided by
factor 2. This is due to correcting impact of data averaging in this type of
calibration. Efficiency calibration done with sampling step ≤ 30°, can be
considered to have at least four independent samples.
$\overline{S_{\text{freq}}}$ may be divided by factor 2 also in stage 2 (i.e.
DUT measurement) for the same reason.
It\'s likely that asymmetry of the field probe will have a very small impact
on this measurement uncertainty contributor, however, an upper bound to probe
symmetry should be considered.
**C1-4 Polarization mismatch between the AAS BS/reference antenna and the
transmitting antenna**
This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between the AAS
BS/reference antenna and the transmitting antenna.
**C1-5 Mutual coupling between the AAS BS/reference antenna and the
transmitting antenna**
This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the AAS BS/reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna. Mutual coupling degrades not just the
antenna efficiency, but it can alter the antenna\'s radiation pattern as well.
For indoor anechoic chamber, usually the spacing between the transmitting
antenna and the AAS BS/reference antenna is large enough so that the level of
mutual coupling might be negligible.
**C1-6 Phase curvature**
This contribution originates from the finite far-field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of the AAS BS/reference
antenna.
**C1-7 Uncertainty of the RF signal generator**
The use of this signal generator introduces an uncertainty on the absolute
output level. The uncertainty value will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s
data sheet in logs. This uncertainty value can be found in Annex E and was a
result of compromised value in order to align all test methods having this
uncertainty contribution.
**C1-8 Impedance mismatch in the transmitting chain**
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the signal generator. The multiple reflections can
produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon the individual
reflections of each part but their reflective interactions as well. The
combination loss by the overall reflection can be higher or lower than
individual loss by multiple reflections. The combination loss is called the
mismatch error and leads to the measurement uncertainty.
**C1-9 Random uncertainty**
The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous effects
which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of uncertainty with a
repeatability test by making a series of repeated measurement with a reference
DUT without changing anything in the measurement set-up.
**C1-10 Impedance mismatch between the transmitting antenna and the network
analyzer**
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate calibration,
the network analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the error
still happens between the transmitting antenna feed cable and the transmitting
antenna.
**C1-11 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference antenna
and the transmitting antenna**
This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing
error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each other, this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
**C1-12 Impedance mismatch between the reference antenna and the network
analyzer**
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the reference
antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate calibration, the network
analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the error still
happens between the transmitting antenna feed cable and the transmitting
antenna.
**C1-13 Uncertainty of the network analyzer**
This uncertainty includes the all uncertainties involved in the S~21~
measurement with a network analyzer, and will be calculated from the
manufacturer\'s data in logs. This uncertainty value can be found in Annex E
and was a result of compromised value in order to align all test methods
having this uncertainty contribution.
**C1-14 Influence of the reference antenna feed cable**
In the calibration Stage 1, the influence of the calibration antenna feed
cable is assessed by measurements. A measurement for calibration may be
repeated with a reasonably differing routing of the feed cable. Largest
difference among the results is entered to the uncertainty budget with a
rectangular distribution.
**C1-15 Reference antenna feed cable loss measurement uncertainty**
Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss have
to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer to measure
its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced.
**C1-16 Influence of the transmitting antenna feed cable**
If the probe antenna is directional (i.e. peak gain >+5 dBi e.g. horn, LPDA,
etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for both stages,
the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant  0.00 dB value.
**C1-17 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the reference antenna**
This contribution originates from the gain/efficiency uncertainty of
calibration antenna that is employed in Stage 2 only. This uncertainty value
will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s data in logs with a rectangular
distribution, unless otherwise informed. This uncertainty value can be found
in Annex E and was a result of compromised value in order to align all test
methods having this uncertainty contribution.
**C1-18 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the transmitting antenna**
The uncertainty appears in both stages and it is thus considered systematic
and constant  0.00 dB value.

This contribution denotes uncertainty in DUT/calibration antenna alignment and
DUT/calibration antenna pointing error. In this measurement the
DUT/calibration antenna is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a zero
contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums
to align, this contribution can be a small contribution. The calibration
antenna\'s phase center and polarization purity changes slightly according to
the frequency. Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this.
To ensure that the point error is at a minimal, this contribution should be
captured using the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the
DUT this would most likely be in the azimuth domain).
**C2-2 Standing wave between DUT and test range antenna**

during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is to capture the
contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof and floor that will
add to the EIS measurement. The sum of all these reflections from the walls,
roof and floor will give the overall value for the QZ ripple. In other words,
the uncertainty component from the wall will not be separated from the roof or
the floor. The purpose of this uncertainty component is to capture the overall
reflections from the chamber walls experienced by the DUT/calibration antenna.
To capture the full effect of the QZ ripple a distance of 1λ should be
measured from each of the DUT/calibration antenna physical aperture edges,
i.e. total QZ distance = physical aperture length + 2 λ, to ensure the full
volume of the QZ is captured in the uncertainty measurement.

measurements.**
This uncertainty includes the all uncertainties involved in the S~21~
measurement (including drift and frequency flatness) with a network analyzer,
and will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs. This uncertainty
also includes analyzer uncertainty for multi-polarization (2 or more ports)
measured simultaneously. This uncertainty value can be found in Annex E and
was a result of compromised value in order to align all test methods having
this uncertainty contribution.
**C2-6 Mismatch of transmit chain (i.e. between transmitting measurement
antenna and DUT)**
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the transmitting antenna and the signal generation
equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the
S~11~ towards the transmit antenna and also towards the test signal generator
equipment. The mismatch between the antenna reflection and the transmit
reflection can also be calculated.
**C2-7 Insertion loss of transmit chain**
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the DUT measurement Stage 2,
the uncertainty is assumed to be systematic. Alternatively, the insertion loss
can also be calculated by taking the measurement of the cable where port 2 is
the end of the cable connected to the measurement antenna.
IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB
**C2-8 RF leakage (SGH connector terminated & test range antenna connector
terminated)**
This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between SGH/reference antenna
and transmitting equipment.
**C2-9 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable**
**a) Flexing cables, adapters, attenuators & connector repeatability.**
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This
is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary
joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as the
uncertainty.
**C2-10 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna**
This uncertainty consists of the uncertainty of the gain value associated with
the gain value denoted from the antenna calibration. This uncertainty value
can be found in Annex E and was a result of compromised value in order to
align all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.

If applicable the contribution of this uncertainty the accuracy in changing
from azimuth to vertical measurements.
**C2-12 Signal Generator Uncertainty**
This uncertainty consists of the uncertainty of the signal generator used to
illuminate the DUT when DUT is in receiving mode. This uncertainty value can
be found in Annex E and was a result of compromised value in order to align
all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.
**C2-13 Miscellaneous uncertainty**
The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the unknown,
unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP measurements. This
term should include truly random effects as well as systematic uncertainties,
such as that arising from dissimilarity between the patterns of the reference
antenna (SGH) and the DUT.
**C2-14 Rotary Joints**
If applicable the contribution of this uncertainty is the accuracy in changing
from azimuth to vertical measurements.
**C2-15 Misalignment positioning system**
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to the maximum
then this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
**C2-16 Standing wave between DUT and test range antenna**
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between DUT and test range antenna. This
value can be captured by moving the DUT towards the test range antenna as the
standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in measured gain.
**C2-17 Switching Uncertainty**
The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically different
RF path to different measurement instruments of different measurement modes.
The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the errors arising from manual
switching work. Switching is also used to measure the path loss values of each
polarization component. Even though the electromechanical switching is
preferable during path loss and antenna performance measurements, some minor
uncertainties can occur when the switch states are programmed to change their
polarity.
# C.3 One Dimensional Compact Range
**C3-1 Misalignment DUT and pointing error**
This contribution denotes uncertainty in DUT alignment and DUT pointing error.
In this measurement the DUT is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a zero
contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums
to align, this contribution can be a small contribution. The reference
antenna´s phase centre and polarization purity changes slightly according to
the frequency. Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this.
To ensure that the pointing error is at a minimal, this contribution should be
captured using the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the
DUT this would most likely be in the azimuth domain).
**C3-2 Standing wave between DUT/reference antenna and test range antenna**
This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of gain
ripple coming from standing waves between DUT/reference antenna and test range
antenna. This value can be captured by moving the DUT/reference antenna
towards the test range antenna as the standing waves go in and out of phase
causing a ripple in measured gain.
**C3-3 Quiet zone ripple DUT/reference antenna**
This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the DUT/reference antenna
during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is to capture the
contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof and floor that will
add to the EIS measurement. The sum of all these reflections from the walls,
roof and floor will give the overall value for the QZ ripple. In other words,
the uncertainty component from the wall will not be separated from the roof or
the floor. The purpose of this uncertainty component is to capture the overall
reflections from the chamber walls experienced by the DUT/reference antenna.
To capture the full effect of the QZ ripple a distance of 1λ must be measured
from each of the DUT/reference antenna physical aperture edges, i.e. total QZ
distance = physical aperture length + 2 λ, to ensure the full volume of the QZ
is captured in the uncertainty measurement.
**C3-4 Signal generator**
This uncertainty consists of the uncertainty of the signal generator used to
illuminate the DUT when DUT is in receiving mode.
**C3-5 Phase curvature**
This contribution originates from the finite far-field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of the DUT/reference antenna.
**C3-6 Polarization mismatch between DUT/reference antenna and transmitting
antenna**
This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between the
DUT/reference antenna and the transmitting antenna.
**C3-7 Mutual coupling between DUT/reference antenna and transmitting
antenna**
This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the DUT/reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna. Mutual coupling degrades not just the
antenna efficiency, but it can alter the antenna's radiation pattern as well.
For compact range chamber, usually the spacing between the transmitting
antenna and the DUT/reference antenna is large enough so that the level of
mutual coupling might be negligible.
**C3-8 Measurement equipment**
This contribution originates from limited absolute level accuracy and non-
linearity of the measurement equipment. The measurement equipment such as a BS
simulator, spectrum analyser, or power meter measures the received signal
level in EIS tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level. The
uncertainty value will be indicated in the manufacturer's data sheet in logs.
**C3-9 Impedance mismatch in transmitting chain**
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the signal generator. The multiple reflections can
produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon the individual
reflections of each part but their reflective interactions as well. The
combination loss by the overall reflection can be higher or lower than
individual loss by multiple reflections. The combination loss is called the
mismatch error and leads to the measurement uncertainty.
**C3-10 RF leakage and dynamic range**
This contribute denotes noise leaking into connectors and cables between test
range antenna and receiving equipment.
**C3-11 Misalignment positioning system**
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle accuracy. If the reference antenna is aligned to the maximum then
this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
**C3-12 Pointing error between reference antenna and test range antenna**
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the _beam peak direction_ of the transmitting antenna due to imperfect
rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and
vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the
beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a
larger measurement error for a narrower beam.
**C3-13 Impedance mismatch in path to reference antenna**
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the reference
antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate calibration, the
measurement equipment may not introduce impedance mismatch error, but the
error still happens between the reference antenna feed cable and the reference
antenna.
**C3-14 Impedance mismatch in path to compact probe**
This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate
calibration, the measurement equipment may not introduce impedance mismatch
error, but the error still happens between the transmitting antenna feed cable
and the transmitting antenna.
**C3-15 Influence of reference antenna feed cable (flexing cables, adapters,
attenuators and connector repeatability)**
During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the reference antenna
and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured. This is
assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and rotary joints.
The largest difference between the results is recorded as the uncertainty.
**C3-16 Mismatch of transmitter chain (i.e. between transmitting measurement
antenna and DUT)**
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from multiple
reflections between the transmitting antenna and the signal generation
equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by measuring the
S~11~ towards the transmit antenna and also towards the test signal generator
equipment. The mismatch between the antenna reflection and the transmit
reflection can also be calculated.
**C3-17 Insertion loss of transmitter chain**
This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration and the DUT measurement stage, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic. Alternatively, the insertion loss can
be calculated by taking the measurement of the cable where port 2 is the end
of the cable connected to the measurement antenna.
IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB
**C3-18 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of reference antenna**
This uncertainty consists of the uncertainty of the gain value associated with
the gain value denoted from the antenna calibration.
**C3-19 RF leakage (SGH connector terminated and test range antenna connector
terminated)**
This contribution denotes noise leaking into connector and cable(s) between
test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution also includes the
noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between SGH/reference antenna
and transmitting equipment.
# C.4 Near Field Test Range
**C4-1 Axes Intersection**
This is a mechanical uncertainty term and aim to find the uncertainty related
with the lateral displacement between the horizontal and vertical axes of the
DUT positioner. This can result in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere.
This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-2 Axes Orthogonality**
The difference from 90° of the angle between the horizontal and vertical axes
also results in sampling the field on a non ideal sphere. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

The horizontal mispointing of the horizontal axis to the probe reference point
for Theta=0° also results in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-4 Probe Vertical position**
The vertical displacement of the probe reference point from the horizontal
axis results in sampling the field on a non ideal sphere. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

This is the knowledge of the distance between the intersection point of the
horizontal and vertical axis and probe reference point. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-7 Amplitude and phase drift**
The system drift due to temperature variations causes the signal at DUT
location to drift in amplitude and phase. This uncertainty is assumed to have
a unif Gaussian orm distribution.
**C4-8 Amplitude and phase noise**
This uncertainty is due to the noise level of the test range so that the S/N
ratio should be determined or measured at the DUT location. The noise level is
usually measured with a spectrum analyzer. This uncertainty is assumed to have
a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-9 Leakage and Crosstalk**
This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system setup.
The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random amplitude and
phase errors so that the relative importance should be determined. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-10 Amplitude non-linearity**
This uncertainty is the linearity of the receiver used for the measurement. It
can be taken from the data sheet of the receiver.
**C4-11 Amplitude and phase shift in rotary joint**
This uncertainty is due to the variation of the rotary joint. It can be
measured and is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-12 Channel balance amplitude and phase**
This uncertainty is relevant for systems which are using dual polarized probes
and polarization switches. The amplitude and phase difference between two
signal channels of the receiver includes the difference between the probe
ports, difference between the channels of the polarization switch, connecting
cables and reflection coefficients. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
**C4-13 Probe polarization amplitude and phase**
The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-14 Probe pattern knowledge**
The probe(s) pattern(s) is assumed to be known so that the DUT measurement in
near field can be corrected when performing the near field to far field
transform. There is no direct dependence between the DUT pattern and the probe
pattern in near field measurements. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
**C4-15 Multiple reflections**
The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna and re-
reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving antenna. This
uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of the DUT when at
different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
**C4-16 Room scattering**
As for the multiple reflections, a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected by either the absorbers or other structures in the measurement
anechoic chamber before being received by the receiving antenna. This effect
can be isolated from the multiple reflections by testing the DUT in different
positions, separated by λ/4 with respect to the anechoic chamber and comparing
these measurements with the reference. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.
**C4-17 DUT support scattering**
This is the uncertainty due to the DUT supporting structure on the signal
level. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-18 Scan area truncation**
This uncertainty does affect the near field measurement. It can be addressed
by comparing the measurement result when scanning the full area. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-19 Sampling point offset**
This uncertainty has an influence in near field and far field. It is assumed
to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-20 Mode truncation**
The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical modes. The
number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering effect generated
by the finite number of modes can improve measurement results by removing
signals from outside the physical area of the AAS BS. Care should be taken in
order to make sure the removed signals are not from the AAS BS itself. This
uncertainty is usually negligible.
**C4-21 Positioning**
The relative position of the probe array is not ideal. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a rectangular distribution.
**C4-22 Probe array uniformity**
This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used for
each physical position. Different probes have different radiation patterns.
This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-23 Mismatch of transmitter chain**
If the same chain configuration (including the vector signal generator; the
probe antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00 dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and should be measured or determined by the method described in 3GPP
TR 25.914 [14]. This uncertainty is assumed to have a U-shaped distribution.
**C4-24 Insertion loss of transmitter chain**
It is composed of the following:
\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable.
\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna attenuator (if used).
\- Insertion loss of RF relays (if used).
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant
 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-25 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the probe antenna**

systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.
**C4-26 Vector Signal Generator**
This uncertainty is composed of the following uncertainties:
\- absolute power level;
\- stability;
\- stability over temperature;
\- linearity.
The expanded uncertainty is the Root Square Sum (RSS) of the standard
uncertainties for each uncertainty contributors. Each uncertainty can be taken
from the instrument data sheet and is assumed to have a uniform distribution.
This uncertainty value can be found in Annex E and was a result of compromised
value in order to align all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.
**C4-27 Measurement Repeatability - Positioning Repeatability**
This uncertainty is due to the repositioning of the DUT in the test setup. It
can be addressed by repeating the corresponding measurement 10 times.
Calculate the standard deviation of the metric obtained and use that as the
measurement uncertainty. For tests that require multiple setups, the worst-
case standard deviation is used. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussiandistribution.
**C4-28 Uncertainty of Vector Network Analyzer**
This uncertainty includes the all uncertainties involved in the S~21~
measurement with a vector network analyzer, and will be calculated from the
manufacturer\'s data sheet. This uncertainty is assumed to have a uniform
distribution. This uncertainty value can be found in Annex E and was a result
of compromised value in order to align all test methods having this
uncertainty contribution.
**C4-29 Mismatch of transmitter chain**
If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the probe
antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00 dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and should be measured or determined by the method described in 3GPP
TR 25.914 [14]. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-30 Insertion loss of transmitter chain**
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant
 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-31 Mismatch in the connection of the calibration antenna**
This is the uncertainty from the mismatch in the connection between the system
coax cable and the calibration antenna. It should be measured or determined by
the method described in 3GPP TR 25.914 [14]. This uncertainty is assumed to
have a U-shaped distribution.
**C4-32 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable**
This uncertainty is due to the impact of the feeding cable on the radiation
properties of the calibration antenna. In case of using either a standard horn
or standard gain horn, the impact of the cable is to be considered negligible
thus the uncertainty  0.00 dB value. In case of using a dipole-like antenna,
the uncertainty should be addressed by measuring this impact. This uncertainty
is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4.33 Influence of the probe antenna cable**
If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration, the
uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and constant
 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.
**C4-34 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna**
The calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the
gain/efficiency uncertainty has to be taken into account. This uncertainty
will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s calibration certificate and is
assumed to have a uniform distribution, unless otherwise informed This
uncertainty value can be found in Annex E and was a result of compromised
value in order to align all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.
**C4-35 Short term repeatability**

###### ### Annex F: Radiated transmit power requirement
The radiated transmit power requirement as described in subclause 9.2 is on
beamformed transmit power in the form of EIRP.
Thus a basestation may transmit several types of beam from different groups of
transmitters and may transmit different beams simultaneously.
The AAS specification requires declaration of a subset of beams, which are
subject to EIRP accuracy requirements when transmitted individually. EIRP is
not a metric that is associated with the basestation as a whole, but rather
with each vendor declared beam.
The subset of beams to declare is described in the conformance specifications
and consists of up to 5 beams with maximum or minimum beamwidth in different
dimensions. In order to select the beams to declare, all possible beamwidths
that may be used during operation should be considered but only the
minimum/maximum are required for declaration).
It is important to note that radiation patterns that result from transmissions
from non-phase aligned transceivers are not considered \"beams\" for
declaration. (Examples of when such transmissions occur during operation are
transmission of PDSCH using codebook based precoding from non phase-aligned
antennas with TM4 or TM9). Only beams that are generated from coherent
transmitters are declared.
The OTA TX power requirement is based upon EIRP. EIRP is in effect a
measurement of radiated power in a particular direction. A beam will consist
of a main lobe and several sidelobes. In an ideal situation, the EIRP is
declared and tested at the centre of the main lobe of a beam. There are no
requirements placed on the side lobes.
{width="2.5131944444444443in" height="1.5402777777777779in"}
Figure F-1: EIRP defined at the centre of the main beam
For some types of beam, the centre of a beam is not straightforward to define
unambiguously, since the beam pattern contains a ripple. The point at which
EIRP is declared and measured at the centre of a beam could be defined in one
of two ways:
\- It could be defined in the direction in which maximum EIRP occurs.
\- It could be defined in the direction that is the geometric centre of the
beam (around the half-power beamwidth).
The point of maximum EIRP may not lie in the geometric centre of the beam.
Furthermore, if a beam is \"steered\" or redirected in space then the ripple
pattern might change and the position of the point of maximum EIRP may not
move in proportion to the movement of the beam, as depicted in figure F1-2.
The direction of the centre of the beam is a good means to describe the
overall steering of the beam, but it will not capture the position of maximum
EIRP in all cases.
{width="4.389583333333333in" height="3.2569444444444446in"}
Figure F-2: Example of a beam with ripple for which the geometric centre\ and
direction of maximum EIRP differ
The specification includes both definitions of beam centre:
\- The direction of maximum EIRP is known as the _beam peak direction._
\- The geometric centre of the beam is known as the _beam centre direction._
When a declared beam is steered in a declared direction, both the _beam peak
direction_ and the _beam centre direction_ are stated. The combination of a
_beam peak direction_ and _beam centre direction_ are collectively called a
_beam direction pair_. Beam steering is always stated using a beam direction
pair; i.e. steering a beam is described in terms of both the centre direction
of the beam and the direction within any ripple at which maximum EIRP occurs.
This allows the _beam centre direction_ part of the pair to be used to
interpret the overall steering direction, whilst the _beam peak direction_ is
tied to the intended beam pointing direction and can be pinpoint the direction
within the ripple across the beam at which the peak of EIRP occurs.
For each beam direction pair where an EIRP declaration is required it is made
(and subsequently measured) at the beam peak direction associated with that
beam direction pair.
{width="4.366666666666666in" height="2.3868055555555556in"}
Figure F-3: Example of position of beam centre direction and beam peak
direction\ for a beam with ripple (left) and a beam with no ripple (right)
Because an AAS can be built with a variety of different architectures and
beamforming applications, the specification does not differentiate beams based
on how they will be used. Instead it states that beams that can be produced by
the basestation are declared. (Only beams with the minimum and maximum
beamwidth are actually declared).
The specification also incorporates the concept of a beam being steered.
Steering implies that the pointing direction of the beam is changed. When a
beam is steered, each different beam steering direction implies a different
_beam direction pair_ (i.e. a different beam centre and beam peak direction).
In order to define directions, a coordinates system is needed. The orientation
of the coordinates system with respect to the physical shape of the AAS
basestation is declared by the manufacturer.
Furthermore, beam steering needs to be defined in relation to a direction in
which \"no steering\" is applied. This direction of \"no steering\" is called
the _reference beam direction_ in the specification. The reference beam
direction in relation to the coordinates system is declared by the
manufacturer. The reference beam direction is not fixed by specification,
since some AAS may have built in downtilt, etc.
A declared beam is characterised by a beamwidth when pointed in the reference
beam direction. A definition of beamwidth is provided in the specification.
When a beam is steered away from the reference beam direction, the beamwidth
may change somewhat, but the beam is still considered to be the same beam.
When a beam is declared, in addition to the beamwidth the steering
capabilities of the beam are also declared. The declared steering capabilities
comprises the set of directions in two dimensions in which the _beam centre
direction_ may be pointed. A convenient way to capture the set of beam
steering directions is on a directions diagram, as in the example below. A
directions diagram is a projection of the polar (Θ Φ) steering coordinates
onto Cartesian axes. In the example, a beam can be steered such that the beam
pointing direction is set to any combination of (Θ, Φ) that is within the blue
area/points indicated on the directions diagram.
{width="6.69375in" height="3.238888888888889in"}
Figure F-4: Example of a directions diagram indicating possible settings\ for
the beam pointing direction
The set of potential _beam centre directions_ may be a continuous range or may
be a discrete set (for example, an AAS that implements a grid of beams may
have a discrete set of potential beam directions).
Regardless of the nature of the set of potential beam centre directions, for
conformance testing 5 directions are selected. One of these is the reference
beam direction. The other 4 directions relate to the maximal extents of
steering in each direction across each of the orthogonal Θ and Φ axes. (In
case the AAS does not support steering of the beam in each direction in each
axis, then some of these 4 directions may coincide and the amount of
conformance testing will be reduced).
The requirement states that for each _beam direction pair_ for which the
corresponding _beam centre direction_ is within the set or range of directions
in which the beam can be steered, the basestation should be capable of meeting
a declared EIRP to within ±2.2dB of the intended EIRP value. (Recall that the
EIRP is declared and measured at the _beam peak direction_ in each _beam
direction pair_.) The EIRP itself will change depending on the beam steering
direction due to phenomenon such as scan loss. The specification does not
require that EIRP (and beamwidth) are actually declared at every possible beam
steering direction, it requires that the basestation has the capability to
meet EIRP accurately such that if, for any direction the EIRP would be
indicated by the manufacturer then the AAS would be able to accurately meet
the declaration.
For conformance testing, the specification requires that EIRP and beamwidth
are declared for each of the 5 \"conformance direction pairs\". The EIRP is
then actually measured in each of the 5 beak peak directions (with the beam
appropriately steered) to verify that the EIRP is indeed met to within the
required accuracy.
Thus, for each beam, the following information is provided:
\- The beamwidth when the beam is steered in the reference direction pair.
\- The complete set of all beam direction pairs over which the beam can be
steered in both Θ and Φ axes:
\- (Declared as a complete set or a range, possibly as a diagram rather than a
text list).
\- The 5 \"conformance beam direction pairs\".
\- For each of the 5 conformance directions, the EIRP (in the corresponding
beam peak direction) and the beamwidth.
For many types of AAS BS, the declaration of beams will be straightforward.
Some examples of what would need to be declared for some common types of
beamforming are described below. These are hypothetical examples that have
been invented for clarifying the mechanism of declarations only; many types of
AAS implementations are possible and these tables do not indicate any kind of
\"typical\" implementation.
EXAMPLE: AAS BS with variable downtilt:
In this example, the AAS BS is a single column that provides variable downtilt
from 0 to 10 degrees. The BS operates in two bands, band X and band Y with two
different beam characteristics. In each band, 2 identical beams (one beam per
polarization) are declared. The reference direction is taken to be (0,0) and
there is only one possible beamwidth in the reference direction.

**AAS BS implementing grid of beams in one dimension:**
The AAS in this example implements a grid of beams in the Φ dimension. The
grid of beams is used for user specific beamforming within one cell. Since the
basestation is operating E-UTRA, it will also transmit cell wide reference
symbols (CRS). Thus this basestation will transmit two types of beam: wide
beamwidth (for carrying the CRS and cell wide traffic) and narrow beamwidth
for carrying the UE specific beams selected from the GoB. Selecting the widest
and narrowest beams will in this case result in declaring two beams (per
polarization).

**TDD AAS BS doing user specific beamforming nd also variable downtilt for the
cell wide beams:**
The third example is a TDD AAS BS. The BS operates E-UTRA. The BS is TDD and
uses reciprocity to perform user specific beamforming (using e.g. TM7 or TM8).
The BS also, of course needs to transmit cell wide signals, and can perform
steering on the cell wide signals.
Thus the maximum beamwidth will correspond in this case to the widest cell
wide signal that the BS can transmit and the minimum beamwidth to the user
specific beamwidth. In this case, both types of beamwidth can be steered.
When in real operation with a fading channel, the beam shape may be very non-
uniform. For the declarations, the minimum beamwidth regular beamshape and
maximum steering directions achieved in a reflection free environment in which
the beam shape is pre-selected (i.e. reciprocity algorithms turned off) is
declared.

###### ### Annex G: OTA sensitivity requirement
The OTA receiver sensitivity requirement is intended to capture system
performance, including antenna array, RDN, TRX array and BB combining and
demodulation algorithms. In this way, the requirement captures all aspects
that influence OTA sensitivity such as beamforming and combining, receiver
electronics noise figure and receiver radiated self-interference (arising e.g.
from Passive intermodulation in some bands).
AAS receivers may vary enormously in both dimension and implementation. At one
extreme is the example shown on the left hand side of figure G-1, in which
there is a single receiver and a fixed combining network in the RDN. The
receive pattern will be fixed and the receiver can be said to have a \"beam
pattern\" in this case. The opposite extreme is shown in the right hand side
of figure G-1. In this case, there are a large number of receivers and a 1:1
mapping with antenna elements. RX combining can be performed on a user
specific basis in baseband. For each user (and potentially each constellation
of interfering users) there may be a specific combining. Thus it is not
possible to talk about a receiver beam pattern or receiver beam for this kind
of architecture. Many AAS implementations will lie somewhere between these two
extremes, with variations of fixed analogue combining and fixed combining
after the RF receivers and active combiners.

Figure G-1: Two extremes of receiver architecture (left) no adaptive
combining,\ (right) all adaptive combining
The OTA sensitivity requirement is designed to be flexible to all different
types of receiver architecture and is complex in its description.
Central to the description is the concept of a _sensitivity Range of Angles of
Arrival (sensitivity RoAoA)_. A sensitivity RoAoA is a range of angles in
azimuth and elevation. When illuminated in any direction within this range, an
AAS BS is able to meet or exceed a (declared) OTA sensitivity level. Outside
of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ range, the sensitivity level does not have
to comply with any requirement. The concept of sensitivity RoAoA is depicted
in figure G-2. The left hand side of the figure shows a one dimensional cut of
a _sensitivity RoAoA_. The sensitivity is achieved over a range of declared
angles in the depicted dimension. A _sensitivity RoAoA_ is declared to capture
steering in both Θ and Φ. This can best be achieved by projecting the Φ and Θ
polar coordinates onto a Cartesian representation, as depicted on the right
hand side of figure G-2. Several grey shaded potential _sensitivity RoAoA_ are
depicted. Each grey area captures a range of combinations of (Θ, Φ) within
which sensitivity can be achieved.
{width="6.634722222222222in" height="2.1756944444444444in"}
Figure G-2: Illustration of range of Angles of Arrival in which sensitivity is
met\ in one dimension (left) and two dimensions (right)
For a simple AAS with only passive combining, a sensitivity RoAoA can be
related to a receive beamwidth. This is not the case though where there is
adaptive combining. It is important to note that a _sensitivity RoAoA_ is not
equivalent to a cell coverage pattern. A cell is defined by the coverage area
of DL reference symbols and an uplink RoAoA can potentially cover more than
one cell. (For example, if cell splitting is implemented then in the uplink,
the RoAoA may contain 2 or more cells).
In the left hand example of figure G-1, as an example the phase progression
applied in the RDN combining may be adjusted (i.e. RET applied). In this case,
the coverage pattern of the uplink will change. Changing the uplink coverage
will redefine the position of the sensitivity RoAoA. In 3GPP TS 37.105 [22],
redefining the position of the sensitivity RoAoA is known as redirecting.
{width="6.69375in" height="1.8854166666666667in"}
Figure G-3 \"Redirection\" of the RoAoA depicted in one dimension (Left) and
two dimensions (Right)
By means of redefining the position of the _sensitivity RoAoA_ , the AAS can
be made to cover a larger range. However it is not possible to achieve
sensitivity in all parts of the larger range simultaneously, as
reconfiguration of some parameters is needed to redirect the RoAoA. The
complete set of all angles of arrival that can be covered by all possible
redirections of the sensitivity RoAoA is called the _redirection range_ in
3GPP TS 37.105 [22].
{width="6.69375in" height="2.1756944444444444in"}
Figure G-4: Illustration of extremes of redirection of RoAoA\ and the
redirection range (highlighted in red)
Ultimately, the AAS BS is able to achieve a (declared) sensitivity for any
angle of arrival within the redirection range. However, at any individual
moment in time, the AAS is not able to instantaneously receive an incoming
signal at sensitivity level that is outside of the current sensitivity RoAoA.
For the receiver architecture depicted in the right hand side of figure G-1,
adaptive UE specific processing in the baseband may enable the basestation to
receive from any direction. Hence the _sensitivity RoAoA_ and the redirection
are likely to coincide for this architecture.
The sensitivity is defined as Equivalent Isotropic Sensitivity, EIS. The EIS
is relates to the strength of a directional signal. A receive quality metric
is also defined, which is based on throughput for E-UTRA and BER for UTRA. The
sensitivity requirement is deemed as being met if, when the basestation is
illuminated with a UTRA or E-UTRA signal of the declared power level, from a
direction within the _sensitivity RoAoA_ the basestation receiver achieves the
quality metric. Sensitivity should be achieved for a signal coming from any
direction that is within the _sensitivity RoAoA_ for any position of the RoAoA
within the redirection range.
The minimum EIS level that should be achieved within the redirection range is
declared by the vendor. The actual sensitivity level does not need to be equal
to the EIS; the sensitivity may be less than EIS at within the redirection
range but may not be worse (greater) than the declared EIS.
Conformance testing is performed by transmitting a signal from 5 angles of
arrival that mark edges of the redirection range and a reference direction.
{width="6.5in" height="2.5381944444444446in"}
Figure G-5 Illustration of conformance test directions
The combination of the declaration of an EIS value (a specific value of EIS is
declared within the redirection range for each supported RAT/bandwidth), a
redirection range within which the EIS value is achieved and some conformance
test parameters is known as an OTA Sensitivity Directions Declaration (OSDD).
A minimum of one OSDD declaration is made and tested. However, it is optional
to declare more than one OSDD. Each different declared EIS value forms a
different OSDD with different redirection range.
Some examples of declarations for OTA sensitivity are as follows. These are
examples that have been invented for the purpose of illustrating how
declarations may be made. A wide variety of different implementations of real
AAS may exist that differ from these examples.
EXAMPLE: Basestation with no adaptive combining capable of 0-10 degrees
downtilt.
