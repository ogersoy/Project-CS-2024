# 4 Introduction
## 4.1 Background
The use of MIMO and receiver diversity in the UE is expected to give large
gains in downlink throughput performance for HSPA and LTE devices. 3GPP
already defined conducted tests for MIMO and multiple antenna receivers (type
1 and type 3 in TS25.101 for HSPA demodulation), but it is clear that the
ability to duplicate these gains in the field is highly dependent on the
performance of the receive-antenna system.
At TSG RAN#41, it was indicated that there is a need for a test methodology to
be created with the aim of measuring and verifying the radiated performance of
multi-antenna and MIMO receiver in UEs for both HSPA and LTE devices. As an
outcome of the discussion, an LS was sent to COST 2100 SWG2.2 and CTIA ERP to
ask them for feedback on their plans/ongoing work in this area, and also the
timescales for which such work could be completed to define such a
methodology, with particular focus on handheld devices and devices embedded in
laptop computers.
Since then, feedback from COST 2100 and CTIA has suggested they are happy to
work on this topic. However given that 3GPP is the customer for this work as
well as being a potential contributor, it is important to aim for commonly-
accepted measurement and test methodology to be used across the industry.
## 4.2 Study item objective
The high level objective of this study item is to define a 3GPP methodology
for measuring the radiated performance of multiple antenna reception and MIMO
receivers in the UE. The test methodology should be relevant for HSPA and LTE
technologies, with particular focus on handheld devices and devices embedded
in laptop computers.
The steps intended to achieve this involve the following:
1) Identify the performance metrics and clarify the requirements of operators
for defining such a methodology.
2) Review of potential solutions also considering input from CTIA ERP and COST
2100.
3) Agree the final solution, and detail the agreed 3GPP solution in a
technical report to be reported to RAN plenary.
4) Maintain ongoing communication with COST 2100 and CTIA ERP to ensure
industry coordination on this topic.
TSG RAN should contact TSG GERAN to get feedback on the applicability of such
a test methodology for GERAN.
## 4.3 High Level Requirements
The following high level requirements are agreed by RAN4:
1\. Measurement of radiated performance for MIMO and multi-antenna reception
for HSPA and LTE terminals must be performed over-the-air, i.e. without RF
cable connections to the DUT.
> NOTE 1: DUTs to the test house will have accessibility to temporary antenna
> port for conducted purposes.
>
> NOTE 2: Temporary antenna port is used to assess to DUT receiver.
>
> NOTE 3: UE special function to measure antenna pattern is not desirable for
> MIMO OTA purposes.
2\. The MIMO OTA method(s) must be able to differentiate between a good
terminal and a bad terminal in terms of MIMO OTA performance.
3\. The desired primary Figure of Merit (FOM) is throughput.

### 5.1.1 Definition of MIMO Throughput
MIMO Throughput is defined here as the time-averaged number of correctly
received transport blocks in a communication system running an application,
where a Transport Block is defined in the reference measurement channel. From
OTA perspective, this is also called MIMO OTA throughput.
The MIMO OTA throughput is measured at the top of physical layer of HSPA and
LTE system. Therefore, this is also measured at the same point as in the
conductive measurement setup: under the use of FRC, the SS transmit fixed-size
payload bits to the DUT. The DUT signals back either ACK or NACK to the SS.
The SS then records the following:
Number of ACKs,
Number of NACKs, and
Number of DTX TTIs
Hence the MIMO (OTA) throughput can be calculated as
where Transmitted TBS is the Transport Block Size transmitted by the SS, which
is fixed for a FRC during the measurement period. MeasurementTime is the total
composed of successful TTIs (ACK), unsuccessful TTIs (NACK) and DTX-TTIs.
The time-averaging is to be taken over a time period sufficiently long to
average out the variations due to the fading channel. Therefore, this is also
called the average MIMO OTA throughput. The throughput should be measured at a
time when eventual start-up transients in the system have evanesced.
### 5.1.2 Definition of SNR
The typical configuration of a MIMO handset under real channel with co-channel
interference is shown in Figure 5.1.2-1. As a first step the interference can
be simplified to use non-directional AWGN with no fading. More realistic noise
including narrowband statistical scheduling and directional aspects is for
further study.
To evaluate the MIMO antenna's influence, a multipath channel needs to be
applied to the downlink signal. This configuration can still be illustrated by
Figure 5.1.2-1.
{width="1.9993055555555554in" height="2.5069444444444446in"}
Figure 5.1.2-1: MIMO Handset under co-channel interference
Suppose a reference dipole antenna is placed in the center of configuration,
then the received signal power by one element of the handset antenna is
$P = P_{s}H_{s}G_{\text{dipole}}$, where _H_ is the channel gain for the
transmitted signal under given configuration, $G_{\text{dipole}}$is the
antenna gain of the dipole antenna.
The received interference signal is
The SNR is defined to be $\text{SNR} = \frac{P}{P_{I}}$ when there is a co-
channel interferer. If the co-channel interferer is removed by setting the
power of the interferer zero, then the test configuration corresponds to the
test case where the device under test self noise will be the major noise
influencing the performance. It is not possible to know the actual SNR for
this case without knowing details of the handset design. From the MIMO OTA
test perspective, it is not necessary to know the actual SNR for this case.
What is needed for the test is to control the downlink signal power to search
for the lowest power level at which the DUT achieves a pre-defined throughput.
This power corresponds to potential improvement in coverage.
The SNR definition is applied to the three main MIMO radiated test methods as
follows:
#### 5.1.2.1 Multiple probe antenna based method
For the multiple probe antenna based methods, the AWGN is applied to a full
circle of antennas surrounding the DUT with equal angle interval. On each
probe antenna, equal power AWGN is applied. Equal power AWGN is applied to
both vertical polarization and horizontal polarization.
The AWGN can be super-imposed on the probe antennas for signal generation or
can be on independent probe antennas. The number of probe antennas for AWGN
noise generation is at least 3 to have a good approximation of spatial AWGN.
When testing MIMO antenna design with the throughput figure of merits, the
AWGN interferer's power level is set to a constant level. The downlink power
level is changed to vary the SNR. The measured throughput under different SNR
will be used to evaluate the different MIMO antenna design. When testing the
coverage improvement, the AWGN interferers are turned off. The downlink signal
power is changed to find the power level where a given throughput is achieved.
The measured signal power with a dipole for this case will be a measure of
potential coverage improvement for the MIMO downlink.
#### 5.1.2.2 Reverberation chamber based method
For the reverberation chamber based method, the way of applying AWGN is to
apply it to the test signal before it is radiated through the test antenna.
When testing MIMO antenna design with the throughput figure of merits, the
AWGN interferer's power level is set to a constant level. The downlink power
level is changed to vary the SNR. The measured throughput under different SNR
will be used to evaluate the different MIMO antenna design. When testing the
coverage improvement, the AWGN interferers are turned off. The downlink signal
power is changed to find the power level where a given throughput is achieved.
The measured signal power with a dipole for this case will be a measure of
coverage improvement.
#### 5.1.2.3 Two-stage method
The spatial AWGN is integrated over the antenna pattern and the resulting
noise power is used to generate the noise power for the second stage
throughput test. The first stage antenna pattern measurement does not require
AWGN. The output power of the channel emulator is set to ensure the power
received by the DUT with RF connection is comparable to the power received
through the DUT's antenna. The SNR is emulated by setting the power of the
AWGN correctly when measuring the throughput for the given MIMO antenna
design. When measuring for coverage improvement, the AWGN interference is
turned off.

\
# 6 Measurement Methodologies
## 6.1 Fixed Reference Measurement Channels (FRCs)
\
## 6.2 MIMO Channel Models
The following channel models are used in evaluation of MIMO OTA methodologies.
The same models are also potential candidates for final MIMO OTA UE tests
(WI).
There are three different clustered delay line (CDL) models, and one
simplified (single cluster) model.
The generic models are
• SCME Urban micro-cell,
• Modified SCME Urban micro-cell,
• SCME Urban macro-cell, and
• WINNER II Outdoor-to-indoor.
The single cluster models are based on
• SCME Urban micro-cell and
• Extended Pedestrian A (EPA)
The uniform models are based on
• Extended Pedestrian A (EPA) and
• Exponential decay.
The emulated base station antennas may be assumed to be one of the following:
1) Vertically polarized elements
a.) with a fixed 4λ separation, specified at the center frequency, or
b) are uncorrelated, i.e. to allow the UE to be measured independently from BS
effects
2) Dual polarized equal power elements that are uncorrelated with a fixed 0λ
separation, 45 degrees slanted.
In the following we define the cross polarization power ratio a propagation
channel as $\text{XPR} = \text{XPR}_{V} = \text{XPR}_{H}$, where
$\text{XPR}_{V} = \frac{S_{\text{VV}}}{S_{\text{HV}}}$ and $\text{XPR}_{H} =
\frac{S_{\text{HH}}}{S_{\text{VH}}}$
and
• S~VV~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on V-polarization and
incident power on V-polarization
• S~VH~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on V-polarization and
incident power on H-polarization
• S~HV~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on H-polarization and
incident power on V-polarization
• S~HH~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on H-polarization and
incident power on H-polarization
Note: for Vertical only measurements, the powers per delay are used without
regard to the specified XPR values.

The parameters of the channel models are the expected parameters for the MIMO
OTA channel models. However, the final channel model achieved for different
methods could be a combined effect of the chamber and the channel emulator.
How the Rayleigh fading is implemented in the channel emulator or in the MIMO
OTA test for different test methods is implementation specific and should be
appropriate as long as the statistics of the generated Rayleigh fading are
within standard requirement on Rayleigh fading statistics.
## 6.3 Downlink Measurement Methodologies
The methodologies defined in this subclause are candidate methodologies being
studied for the purpose of defining procedures for conformance testing of over
the air performance.
### 6.3.1 Methodologies based on Anechoic RF Chamber
An OTA method based on the use of an Anechoic RF Chamber is described
consisting of a number of test antenna probes located in the chamber
transmitting signals with temporal and spatial characteristics for testing
multiple antenna devices.
This section describes the methodologies based on Anechoic RF Chamber, where a
number of test antennas are located in different positions of the chamber, and
the device under test (DUT) is located at center position. The DUT is tested
over the air without RF cables.
#### 6.3.1.1 Candidate Solution 1
An Anechoic Chamber technique is defined, consisting of a number of source
elements at one end or surrounding the DUT to create a realistic geometric
based spatio-temporal radio channel for testing MIMO performance. The latter
implementation is illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.1-1.
By utilizing specific geometries of the test probes in the chamber, a range of
possible channels are emulated. The exact number and positioning of the source
antenna probes will be fixed in a final design; however they may be optimized
for the best performance when the OTA channel models are defined. In other
words, depending on the types of channel models required and the range of
parameters needed for testing, the number of probes may be optimized to
produce the best performance with the fewest number of probes. For example,
based on the range of channels defined by the SCM, SCME, Winner I & II channel
models, the optimized number of probes may vary from 6 to 8 for a given
polarization. In general, the most flexible configurations require the higher
number of probes.
Azimuth spread is created by energizing sets of probes separated in azimuth
with signals that will combine over the air at a specific delay to emulate a
path or cluster. Elevation spread may be created by installing probes at
different elevations, however doing this tends to constrain their flexibility.
The components of the solution include:
● Anechoic Chamber
● System Simulator (SS)
● N channel RF emulator, with OTA Channel Generation Features
● N antenna elements configured with V, H or co-located V&H or slant X
polarizations
● K azimuthally separated antenna positions with predefined angles at radius R

Figure 6.3.1.1-2: OTA System Level Block Diagram
A system level block diagram is shown in Figure 6.3.1.1-2, which includes the
SS to generate the M branch MIMO signal, and an RF Channel Emulator with an
OTA Channel Generation Feature to properly correlate, fade, scale, delay, and
distribute the signal to each test probe in the chamber.
For research purposes, a range of possible channel models and
parameterizations will be used to specify the most generic and versatile
antenna test probe configuration. For performance and conformance testing, the
channel model is expected to be limited in scope or simplified, which may
allow an optimized design to reduce the number of test probes required. Thus
the number of test probes will be selected to best meet the requirements of
the test so that the most efficient and economical design can be achieved.
##### 6.3.1.1.1 Concept and Configuration
##### 6.3.1.1.1.1 Emulating Spatial Channels {#emulating-spatial-channels .H6}
Spatial channel models, including SCM, SCME, Winner I & II, and ITU-A, were
developed from measured data, and attempt to preserve the measured behaviour
of the channel at the path (cluster) level, including spatial, temporal,
polarization, and delay characteristics. Reference [3] described a technique
for reproducing the spatial characteristics of a narrow angle spread signal
with a reduced number of antenna probes. This technique uses pre-faded signals
at each probe wherein the power-adjusted signals from the multiple probes,
i.e. typically 2-4 or more, are combined over the air to produce an accurate
narrow angle spread representation of the signal for each delay. This
technique is able to maintain its close match to an ideal narrow angle spread
signal even for severe antenna variations.
The spacing of the antenna probes in the chamber are constrained by the range
of angle spreads being emulated, and therefore the channel model is a key
determining factor in optimizing an OTA chamber design. For the angle spreads
defined by SCM, SCME, Winner I & II, and the ITU-A channel models, the optimum
number of probes may vary from 6 to 8 for a given polarization, depending on
the device type, and for large devices the number of probes may increase. In
general, the most flexible configurations will tend to require the higher
number of probes. Once the design of parameters of the system are decided, it
is expected that the number of probes will be fixed to a value that works for
all channel models and devices being simulated. Figure 6.3.1.1.1.1-1
illustrates some practical antenna probe configurations to support devices
such as handsets and laptops. The single cluster approach can be performed
using probes distributed over a portion of a circle or in a full ring-like
distribution.

Figure 6.3.1.1.1.1-1: Some Practical Antenna Probe Configurations, (shown with
dual polarization)
The probe separation angle, φ used in the Chamber design, shown in Figure
6.3.1.1.1.1-1, will be defined in conjunction with the channel models as
described below. In general, the angles will not be exact even integer
fractions of pi, to avoid symmetries. i.e. exact symmetry will produce
convergence problems due to correlated Doppler, e.g. $\text{cos}(\alpha) = -
\text{cos}(\alpha + \pi)$.
##### 6.3.1.1.1.2 Joint Selection of a Channel Model and a Chamber Design
{#joint-selection-of-a-channel-model-and-a-chamber-design .H6}
Since link modelling is usually associated with a single "drop" or single
"channel realization" from the channel model, a few specific channel
realizations will likely be specified and standardized for evaluation
purposes. From a testing standpoint, only a few channel realizations will be
measured in an OTA performance/conformance system, and it would be useful to
align the channel model clusters with the probe locations in an optimized
chamber design. However, there is enough flexibility inherent in these probe
configurations to emulate clusters from arbitrary angles if desired.
Specifically, since the chamber layout has probes at specific angles, and
since most spatial channel models draw channel AoAs randomly from specified
distributions, it is reasonable that specific AoAs are chosen to align with
the chamber layout for these few test channels.
For research purposes, a more generic OTA chamber design is possible, but
generally at the cost of having the maximum number of probes. Also, there is a
trade-off in modelling signals with arbitrary AoA while controlling the
signals Angle Spread at the same time. By selecting specific AoAs within a
valid channel realization, a more precise AS can be obtained. Thus performance
of the OTA design is closely tied to the channel modelling assumptions used,
and can be specified more completely when the channel model and it's
associated parameters are specified.
##### 6.3.1.1.2 Test Conditions
For performance and conformance testing purposes, only a small number of
channel realizations is practical due to the nature of the OTA measurements.
Based on this, it is reasonable to define a range of conditions for testing
that can be represented in 2-3 channel realizations. It is anticipated that
these channel realizations would represent a Low, Medium, and High correlation
cases, which generally align to the ability of the channel to support MIMO
operation.
These channels may also be used to optimize the design and layout of the
chamber to reduce the number of probes and achieve the most efficient and cost
effective design.
#### 6.3.1.2 Candidate Solution 2
The MIMO OTA test setup is composed of a number of OTA chamber antennas, a
multidimensional fading emulator, an anechoic chamber, communication tester /
BS emulator and a device under test (DUT). The following figure depicts an
example of the OTA concept. The purpose of the figure is not to restrict the
implementation, but rather to clarify the general idea of the MIMO OTA
concept. For simplicity, uplink cabling is not drawn here.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="3.8430555555555554in"}
Figure 6.3.1.2-1: Example of MIMO/Multiantenna OTA test setup (Uplink signal
path omitted in the figure)
The DUT is located at center of the anechoic chamber. The idea of locating DUT
into center provides a possibility to create a radio channel environment where
the signal can arrive from various possible directions simultaneously to the
DUT. This is the key aspect of the wideband MIMO radio channel models
implemented today.
The proposed test setup is composed of a transmitter, a multidimensional radio
channel emulator, an anechoic chamber equipped with OTA antennas and a DUT
with multiple antennas. The crucial challenge is to generate realistic angular
and polarization behavior within the anechoic chamber. The family of geometry-
based stochastic channel models (GSCM) is well suitable for MIMO OTA testing.
The GSCM include 3GPP SCM, SCME, WINNER and IMT-Advanced channel models. This
angular and polarization behavior creates appropriate correlation at the DUT
antennas. The correlation is defined implicitly via the per-path angle of
arrival and real antennas. Correlation matrix based model is not suitable for
this, because it includes the antenna information in the model itself.
Geometry based channel modeling methodology models BS and UE antenna arrays
and the propagation between them (including angular power spectra). The
parameters that are included are Doppler, Angle of Arrival, Angle of
Departure, delay and polarization. The parameters are based mainly on
measurements. The measurements define certain statistics and radio channel
realizations are then created by these statistical properties.
The geometrical models are divided in to three parts:
1) BS antenna arrangement and the angular power spectrum as well as the AoD
from the BS are modeled in the channel emulator.
2) AoA is created by dividing the appropriate clusters based on their original
AoA to corresponding OTA antennas. The user terminal is not physically in a
motion, thus the fading and Doppler spectrum are built in the channel model.
3) The angular power spectrum at DUT is created by radiating the signal from
multiple OTA antennas.
UE (DUT) antenna characteristics are assumed unknown. In other words we do not
use this information in the OTA modeling.
##### 6.3.1.2.1 Concept and Configuration
The idea of the MIMO OTA modelling is that the geometric channel models are
mapped into the fading emulator. The mapping process covers all the required
mathematics when converting the traditional geometric channel model to fading
emulator tap coefficients as well as the calibration. The modeling process is
shown in Figure 6.3.1.2.1-1.
{width="4.249305555555556in" height="2.6347222222222224in"}
Figure 6.3.1.2.1-1: Modelling process
The setup of OTA chamber antennas with eight antenna elements is depicted in
Figure 6.3.1.2.1-2. DUT is at center and the antennas are on a circle around
DUT with uniform spacing (e.g. 45° with 8 elements). Let us denote directions
of _K_ OTA antennas with _θ~k~_ , _k_ = 1, ..., _K_ , and antenna spacing in
the angle domain with _∆θ_. Each antenna is connected to a single fading
emulator output port. If single antenna BS is considered the fading emulator
configuration is 1x8 SIMO, with two BS antennas 2x8 MIMO etc. If dual
polarized OTA antennas are used like in Figure 6.3.1.2.1-3 the fading emulator
configuration will be with 1 BS antenna 1x16 SIMO, with two BS antennas 2x16
MIMO etc. In the figure for example antenna A~1V~ denotes the first OTA
antenna position and vertically (V) polarized element, A~8H~ denotes the eight
OTA antenna position and horizontally (H) polarized element, etc.

polarized chamber antennas. In the drawing the V-polarized elements are
actually orthogonal to the paper (azimuth plane)
##### 6.3.1.2.1A Scalability of the methodology
The number of antennas is scalable. In theory, there is no upper limit and the
lower limit is one. The required number of channels depends on three main
aspects: channel model, DUT size, and polarization. The key question is how
accurately the channel model is emulated. Based on the quiet zone discussion,
it was proposed to use 8 antennas in the case of single polarization and 16
antennas in the case of dual polarization. However, for single cluster case,
less antennas may be enough. On the other hand, if elevation is needed, the
antenna number will be higher. Additionally, the antenna positions can be
adjusted to optimize the accuracy with limited number of antennas.
Other aspect is the channel model. Most of the geometry-based stochastic
channel models (GSCMs) are two-dimensional, i.e. azimuth plane only, but the
proposed MIMO OTA concept is not limited into azimuth plane. It can also be
extended to elevation plane, when we talk about 3D MIMO OTA. However, the 3D
MIMO OTA is rather complex and it does not provide very much additional
information about the DUT. Therefore, 3D MIMO OTA can be considered as one
future development, but it is not the recommended solution in the beginning of
MIMO OTA testing.
Downscaling of the proposed method is more attractive due to the possibility
to save the cost of the test system. Full SCME requires at least 8 probe
antennas, but single cluster SCME can be implemented with lower number of
antennas. The difference between full SCME and Single Cluster model is
depicted in Figure 6.3.1.2.1A-1. Basically the only difference is that the
mean Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of each cluster is turned to the same direction.
Obviously, one AoA requires lower number of antennas than multiple AoAs
especially when angular spread is narrow, e.g., 35 degrees. The number of
fading channels is the same as the number of antennas. Therefore, single
cluster SCME would require less fading channels as well.

##### 6.3.1.2.2 Test Conditions
This candidate solution supports testing of different figure of merits. It is
also applicable for any 3GPP Release, and even for other standards. It
supports different channel models from SCM to IMT-Advanced. Due to its
generality, it does not restrict the test conditions. However, for simplicity,
it is good to start from downlink throughput testing.
The downlink throughput testing can be done e.g. in following manner.
BS transmits signal through a radio channel emulator. This signal is routed to
several antennas in anechoic chamber. The DUT is placed at center of the
chamber and the performance is measured from the DUT.
● OTA antennas are located along a circle around the DUT.
● The circular geometry is needed because we need signal from many directions
at the same time (requirement from the channel models)
The test steps can be, e.g., according to [3] or as follows:
1) Calibrate the full system with a test signal.
2) Set the first test case (e.g. channel model) to the fading emulator.
3) Generate test signal by the communication tester / BS emulator.
4) Measure the DUT performance (downlink throughput).
5) If the performance exceeds the specified limit, the DUT passes the test
case.
6) If all test cases done, go to step 7. Otherwise, set the next test case
(e.g. channel model) to the fading emulator and go back to step 3.
7) If DUT passed all the test cases, the DUT passes the full MIMO OTA test.
8) If DUT failed in at least one test case, the DUT failed the full MIMO OTA
test.
#### 6.3.1.3 Candidate Solution 3
The principle of two-stage MIMO OTA method is based on the assumption that the
far-field antenna radiation pattern will contain all the necessary information
for evaluation the antenna's performance like radiation power, efficiency and
correlation and that with channel model approaches, the influence of antenna
radiation pattern can be correctly incorporated into the channel model. Thus
the method will first measure the MIMO antenna patterns and then incorporate
the measurement antenna patterns with chosen MIMO OTA channel models for real-
time emulation. In order to accurately measure the antenna pattern of the
intact device, the chipset needs to support amplitude and relative phase
measurements of the antennas. If the EUT has dynamic antenna tuning elements,
detailed information on the implementation is required to understand the
consequences for the pattern measurement. The BTS and DUT can then be
connected to the real-time channel emulator through the standard temporary
antenna connectors to do the test on throughput, etc., to test how the MIMO
antennas will influence the performance.
It should be noted that should this methodology be chosen for conformance
testing, the method for antenna gain and phase measurement would require to be
standardized. The details for proposed antenna gain and phase measurements are
FFS. Further details will be provided before the RAN4 evaluation of this
methodology can progress.
##### 6.3.1.3.1 Concept and Configuration
The assumption of the two-stage MIMO OTA method is that the measured far field
antenna pattern of the multiple antennas can fully capture the mutual coupling
of the multiple antenna arrays and their influence. Thus to do the two-stage
MIMO OTA test, the antenna patterns of the antenna array needs to be measured
accurately in the first stage. In order to accurately measure the antenna
pattern of the intact device, the chipset needs to support amplitude and
relative phase measurements of the antennas.
Stage 1: Test multiple antennas system in a traditional anechoic chamber. The
chamber for antenna pattern measurement is set up as described in Annex A.2 in
[4], where the DUT is put into a chamber and each antenna element's far zone
pattern is measured. Section B.4.3 gives description on how to measure each
antenna element's pattern using non-intrusive method. The influence of human
body loss can be measured by attaching the DUT to a SAM head and or hand when
doing the antenna pattern measurements. The DUT is placed against a SAM
phantom, and the characteristics of the SAM phantom are specified in Annex A.1
of [4]. The chamber is equipped with a positioner, which makes it possible to
perform full 3-D far zone pattern measurements for both Tx and Rx radiated
performance. The measurement antenna should be able to measure two orthogonal
polarizations (typically linear theta (θ) and phi (φ) polarizations as shown
in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-1).
{width="3.301388888888889in" height="3.5215277777777776in"}
Figure 6.3.1.3.1-1: The coordinate system used in the measurements
Stage 2: Combine the antenna patterns measured in stage 1 into MIMO channel
model, emulate the MIMO channel model with the measured antenna patterns
incorporated in the commercial channel emulator and perform the OTA test in
conducted approach.
The MIMO OTA method based on the above mentioned two-stage method is
illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2. The integrated channel model with both MIMO
antenna effect and the multipath channel effect can be emulated with a
commercial MIMO channel emulator. The BS emulator is connected to the MIMO
channel emulator and then to the MIMO device's temporary antenna ports via
approved RF cables. These ports are the standard ones provided for conducted
conformance tests. By controlling the power settings of the channel emulator
and also the integrated channel model, the end-to-end throughput with the MIMO
antenna radiation influence can be measured.
There are two different approaches to combine the antenna patterns with MIMO
channel model.
a) Apply antenna patterns to Ray-based channel models. Ray-based models are
capable to support arbitrary antenna patterns under predefined channel modes
in a natural way as described above. If Ray-based model like SCM model is
specified to be used for MIMO OTA test, then the channel emulator needs to be
able to support SCM channel model emulation and support loading measured
antenna patterns.
b) Apply antenna patterns to correlation-based channel models. MIMO channel
model. With a correlation matrix calculation method for arbitrary antenna
patterns under multipath channel conditions, the correlation matrix and the
antenna imbalance can be calculated and then emulated by the channel emulator.
c) This method can be used to measure the following figure of merit:
1) Throughput
2) TRP and TRS
3) CQI, BLER
4) Antenna efficiency and MEG
5) Antenna correlation, MIMO channel capacity.
The coupling between the UE antenna and internal spurious emission of the UE
might be characterized during the antenna pattern measurement stage inside the
chamber by lowering down the signal power and is for further research.
{width="2.907638888888889in" height="2.00625in"}
Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2: Proposed two-stage test methodology for MIMO OTA test
##### 6.3.1.3.2 Test Conditions
This candidate solution supports testing of different figure of merits. It is
also applicable for any 3GPP Release, and even for other standards.
This method can reuse existing SISO OTA anechoic chambers to make the antenna
pattern measurements; the channel emulator number is required to match the
number of device receiver inputs regardless of the complexity of the chosen
channel model, the method is consequently easily scalable to higher order MIMO
due to the reduced number of instruments required; the channel models are
highly accurate due to being implemented electronically and are also fully
flexible and can be altered to suit any desired operating conditions such as
indoor-outdoor, high or low Doppler spread, high or low delay spread, beam
width, in 2D or full 3D etc.
This method requires the chipset in DUT to support amplitude and relative
phase measurements of the antennas, and it cannot directly measure self-
desensitization since the antenna pattern measurement does not take account of
possible signal leakage from the device transmit antennas into the receive
antennas.
The detailed test procedure can be found in Annex B.
#### 6.3.1.4 Candidate Solution 4
In this method an assessment of the antenna's performance in MIMO or Diversity
operation is performed. Several simplifications are used in order to optimise
the testing.
A test of the UE in an anechoic environment with the help of a base station
emulator is proposed, with a limited number of faded channels and transmitting
antennas, and in a simple geometrical set-up.
The underlying principle is to decompose the task for evaluating MIMO
performance. Since in the conformance test many properties of the DUT are
already tested in a conducted environment, the OTA test only has to add
information not achievable by a cabled set-up.
For that reason it then is sufficient to define some abstract channel
environment during the test which does not need to be very close to reality.
Abstraction on the environment makes it easier to interpret the obtained
results.
The channel information available in the UE can be used to deliver a quick
answer to the test system about the current receive quality. Such a
measurement is much faster than the evaluation of a throughput figure, but it
is nevertheless closely related to it. If necessary, an explicit scaling from
one quantity onto the other one can be made.
##### 6.3.1.4.1 Concept and Configuration
_The_ test set-up uses an anechoic chamber. In case of an RX diversity
measurement the signal from the base station emulator is routed via a two-
channel fading to two antennas in the chamber. For an RX MIMO measurement, the
two signals from the base station emulator can undergo a 2x2 channel fading
simulation before reaching the antennas in the chamber, or can be routed
directly to the probe antennas with some chosen polarization.
Figure 6.3.1.4.1-1 is a sketch of the chamber set-up. For obtaining various
angles of arrival (AoA) at the EUT, two antennas A1 and A2 can be rotated in a
vertical plane and can be put to angles θ1 and θ2. The UE is placed on a
turntable rotating around the vertical axis by some angle φ. In addition, the
UE may be tilted by some additional rotation around the horizontal axis, not
shown in the figure. By this arrangement the two antennas A1 and A2 can send
the signals from the base station emulator to any position on the unit sphere
around the UE, thus creating arbirtrary AoA.
As an alternative to moving the antennas by mechanically rotating them it is
possible to arrange the antennas in a horizontal plane and to move one antenna
with respect to the other in order to vary the angle difference between the
two. In that case the positioner rotating the UE will be designed in a more
complex way.
Typically, the antennas are dual-polarised ones. In the usual configuration
each antenna is sending its signal in one polarization only. Tests are made
for the various combinations of antenna polarizations in order to generate
either co-polarized or cross-polarized signals. As a special case it is also
possible to test with one antenna where each polarization is transmitting one
MIMO data stream. This will lead to identical AoAs for the two data streams.
If one wants to extend this method to 3D AoA, a third antenna outside the
plane can be used.
The figure does not show an additional antenna used for the uplink
communication. This antenna may be placed in the vicinity of the UE, for
example in the φ positioner. It is common practise to use circularly polarized
antennas for this purpose, and to use a limiting amplifier in the path towards
the BSE in order to get a good and constant UL level.
{width="2.504861111111111in" height="2.7055555555555557in"}
Figure 6.3.1.4.1-1: 2 Channel Method, antenna arrangement in anechoic chamber
A test point is described by:
1) Signal from BSE, e.g. frequency, MCS, data rate, MIMO mode, ...
2) Fading characteristics (if applicable) and antenna polarisations
3) Antenna positions
4) UE position elevation, azimuth
The detailed settings for the various parameters describing a test point are
for further study.
The measurement then uses the quantities CQI, RI and PMI for a quick
evaluation of the channel characteristics for each given test point. More
precisely, the DL power will be changed until a change in the returned channel
information is observed.
In case the required figure of merit is some other quantity such as
throughput, some mapping from the channel information onto the figure of merit
can be made. This mapping of course depends on the signal settings on the BSE
and possibly on other parameters. The mapping can be derived in a series of
measurements where changes to the channel parameters lead to different channel
information values and to different corresponding values of the figure of
merit. It is also possible but more time-consuming to measure the figure of
merit for each test point.
The OTA performance can better be described by taking statistical evaluations
into account. If, for example, for each test point a relative throughput value
is obtained as function of subcarrier power, one can plot the results for
different points in a histogram and to obtain some CCDF indicating the
conditions for getting at least a given TP value.
#### 6.3.1.5 Candidate Solution 5
The RF-controlled spatial fading emulator can directly reproduce a multipath
radio propagation environment by radio waves emitted from antenna-probe units
arranged around a handset tested. Moreover, the emulator has an advantage of
measuring radiation characteristics of a handset antenna for the present OTA
testing in 3GPP as well as the multipath testing because of its RF operation
[6].
##### 6.3.1.5.1 Concept and Configuration
The RF-controlled spatial fading emulator can directly reproduce multipath
radio propagation environments both in line-of-sight (LOS) and non line-of-
sight (NLOS) situations by radio waves emitted from antenna probes arranged
around a DUT. Thus, the emulator can be easily used for measurement of the
MIMO characteristics of a HSPA/LTE multiple antenna device in a multipath
fading environment.
Figure 6.3.1.5.1-1 (a) and (b) show the configuration and arrangement of the
antenna probes of the RF spatial fading emulator in an anechoic chamber. In
this method, the DUT is designated as any device that possesses multiple
antennas, including a HSPA or LTE device.
The height of DUT from the floor of the anechoic chamber is **_H_**. The DUT
can also be placed at a rotatable turn-table in order to set and vary the
horizontal angle of the DUT. The DUT is surrounded by **_N_** numbers of
antenna probes. The distance between DUT and each antenna probe is **_r_**.
The antenna probe consists of two antennas. The one is a half-wavelength
dipole set vertically for emitting the vertically-polarized wave and the other
is a horizontally-located half-wavelength dipole for the horizontally-
polarized wave. This configuration of the antenna-probe unit can represent a
cross polarization power ratio, XPR, of incoming wave. The separation between
vertical and horizontal antennas is **_d_**. The height of the antenna probe
from the anechoic chamber floor is **_h_**. The distance between the ring of
antenna probes and the walls of anechoic chamber is **_D_**. (Note if the
anechoic chamber is not square, then **_D~1~_** and **_D~2~_** are used).
A reference antenna probe is designated so that it can be used to determine
the direction of motion of DUT. This parameter is designated as
$\varphi_{\text{shift}}$. The circular angle between antenna probes from the
centre of the ring (i.e. DUT) is $\varphi_{i}$ with respect to the reference
antenna probe.

Figure 6.3.1.5.1-1: Experimental setup of the spatial fading emulator
The key features of this method are that it does not use the sophisticated
commercial channel emulator. By using the combination of phase shifters, power
dividers and attenuators, operating in the RF band, it has been shown that a
realistic fading channel environment can be emulated. To reduce the influence
from the measurement equipment, the receiver, phase shifter, power divider,
transmitter and computer are set outside of the anechoic chamber. Firstly, we
describe channel response between the _m_ ^th^ base station, BS, antenna and
the _n_ ^th^ handset antenna for _M_ -by-_N_ MIMO radio communication system.
The channel response is calculated by following equation:
$h_{\text{nm}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}{E_{n}\left( \varphi_{i}
\right)\sqrt{\Omega\left( \varphi_{i} \right)}}\frac{\lambda}{4\pi \cdot
r}\text{exp}\left\lbrack - j\left{ \text{kr} + 2\pi \cdot t \cdot
f_{D}\text{cos}(\varphi_{0} - \varphi_{i}) + \alpha_{\text{mi}} \right}
\right\rbrack$ (1)
where _E~n~_ and _f~D~_ are radiation component of the _n_ -th handset antenna
and the Doppler frequency respectively. _φ~0~_ is the direction of motion and
_φ_ ~i~ is the direction of the _i_ -th antenna probe. _α~mi~_ is initial
phase of the signal radiated from the _i_ -th antenna probe. The waves
radiated from each base station (BS) antenna are uncorrelated each other. For
the investigation of MIMO antennas, the waves from different BS antenna are
represented by different sets of initial phases, _α~mi~_ , of the waves.
According to the propagation models, such as SCM and SCME, the angular power
spectrum _Ω_ of the spatial cluster of incoming waves in the horizontal plane
can be modelled by a Laplacian distribution in the following, for instance:
$\Omega\left( \varphi \right) = \frac{P}{2\sigma}\text{exp}\left{ -
\frac{\left| \varphi - \mu_{\varphi} \right|}{\sigma} \right}$ (2)
where _P_ and _μ~φ~_ are power and average direction of angle of the cluster.
_σ_ is a standard deviation of the APS. In this case, the spatial distribution
in the vertical plane is modelled by a delta function.
In addition, the strongest point of the spatial fading emulator is to be
capable of evaluating radiation characteristics of a handset antenna for the
present OTA testing in 3GPP as well as the multipath-fading evaluation since
the emulator is operated in a radio frequency (RF) band.
A calibration of the RF-controlled spatial fading emulator is carried out
using the following procedure:
1) Firstly a half-wavelength dipole for the receiving antenna is vertically
placed at the center of a circle arranging the antenna probes.
2) A radio wave with vertical polarization is radiated only from a vertical
dipole of the antenna probe #i (i=1, 2, ..., L), and then, the dipole at the
center of the emulator can receive the wave. From this, we can obtain
amplitude and phase of the RF signal from the transmitter to the receiver via
the vertical dipole of the antenna probe #i.
3) The attenuator and phase shifter are adjusted so that the RF signals
received by the dipole at the center have the same values in amplitude and
phase.
4) Secondly the slotted cylindrical antenna is placed at the center of the
antenna probes located on the circle.
5) A radio wave with horizontal polarization is radiated only from a
horizontally-located dipole of the antenna probe #i (i=1, 2, ..., L). From the
received signal from the antenna probe #i, we also obtain amplitude and phase
of the RF signal from the transmitter to the receiver via the horizontal
dipole of the antenna probe #i.
6) The attenuator and phase shifter are adjusted so that the RF signals
received by the slotted cylindrical antenna at the center have the same values
in amplitude and phase.
The calibration procedure above mentioned can be performed by using an
electrical-controlled RF switch. Thus, the calibration of the emulator can be
done automatically using a computer in our system. Once the calibration is
finished, we can vary the attenuators in order to produce a special
distribution of the incoming wave and to make a cross polarization power ratio
(XPR). Moreover, we can set an initial phase to each antenna probe to create a
multipath fading channel.
With regard to the signal-to-noise power ratio, SNR, of incoming wave, the
signal power can be determined by an average value of faded signal powers
received by a half-wavelength dipole antenna for the vertical polarization and
a slotted cylindrical antenna for the horizontal polarization. Both antennas
have an omni-directional radiation pattern. Thus, SNR can be obtained as the
following equation:
$\text{SNR} = \frac{S_{V} + S_{H}}{N_{0}}$ (3)
where _S~V~_ and _S~H~_ are the average signal powers received by the dipole
and slotted cylindrical antennas, respectively. _N~0~_ is the noise power that
was calculated as a thermal noise within the frequency bandwidth of the radio
communication.
##### 6.3.1.5.2 Test Conditions
In this method, all signals are operated and controlled at RF level. A
computer (either a laptop or relatively powerful computer) is used to provide
the followings:
1) Graphical user interface (GUI) to set the input parameters, determine the
measured parameters to be collected, setting of calibration parameters and
setting of DUT parameters.
2) Generating control signals to manipulate the phase angle of each Phase
Shifter.
3) Collecting measured raw data obtained via the DUT.
4) Post-processing the measured raw data to derive the desired figure of
merits (i.e. minimum requirements for DUT).
5) To initiate the BS emulator and start the testing session (by establishing
a communication session with DUT)
The RF signals transmitted from the BS emulator's antenna connector are fed to
a bank of Power Dividers. Each power divider provides identical RF signal from
each of the output ports. The number of Power Dividers required is determined
by **_N_**.
Each Power Divider output is then fed to a Phase Shifter. The Phase Shifter is
used to change the phase of the RF signal according to the parameter setting
input to the computer earlier. Note that the control signal from the computer
is digital-to-analogue, D/A, converted, before used to control the Phase
Shifter. By controlling the phase of each RF signal, a Rayleigh distributed or
other relevant multipath distribution can be obtained. The number of Phase
Shifters required is determined by **_N_**.
The output of the Phase Shifters is connected to the antenna probes. The
signal from each Phase Shifter is fed to the vertical and horizontal antennas
and radiates toward the DUT. The DUT then measures the signals from each
antenna probe and the measurement data is reported back to the computer. The
amount of measurement data to be collected can be controlled by the computer
by setting the sampling rate, **_R_**.
An example below illustrated the principle of creating Rayleigh faded signal
by control the phase of each component wave in Figure 6.3.1.5.2-1.

### 6.3.2 Methodologies based on Reverberation Chamber
#### 6.3.2.1 Candidate Solution 1
The reverberation chambers is a metallic cavity or cavities that can emulate
an isotropic multi-path environment which represents a reference environment
for systems designed to work during fading, similar to how the free space
"anechoic" reference environment is used for tests of Line-Of-Sight systems.
The Rayleigh environment in a reverberation chamber is well known as a good
reference for urban and indoor environments, but does not well represent rural
and suburban environments.
For a future Multi-antenna OTA measurement standard it is important to have a
fast and repeatable test method to evaluate and compare multi-antenna devices
in the environments and under the conditions where most people will use them.
The overwhelming majority of calls/data connections with mobile phones are
made indoors and in urban areas which can be very well represented by the
reverberation chamber. These environments are well characterised by multi-path
and 3D distribution of the communication signals and it makes sense to use the
reverberation chamber for optimizing/evaluating devices with both single and
multiple antenna configurations to be used indoors and in urban areas.
The test setup for testing UE receiver diversity performance is composed of a
base station emulator, a reverberation chamber equipped with fixed BS wall-
mounted antennas, a switch to direct the base station signal to/from one of
the BS wall mounted antennas, mechanical metallic stirrers and a rotating
platform to hold the DUT (Figure 6.3.2.1-1). Alternatively, the chamber may
contain one or more cavities coupled through waveguides or slotted plates
(Figure 7.1-2).
Reverberation chambers have no quiet zone. As long as the DUT is placed at
least 0.5 wavelengths from the wall or metallic stirrers the result will be
the same within the standard deviation of the chamber.
Mechanical stirrers and switching among different fixed BS wall-mounted
antennas (monopoles used for polarization stirring) allow simulating the
Rayleigh fading at each antenna of the terminal inside the chamber. Accuracy
can even been increased by rotating the platform holding the device.
Each position of the mechanical stirrers for each position of the platform and
each fixed BS antenna, represents a point of the Rayleigh distribution in
terms of receive power on the device antennas. In that way a Rayleigh fading
is artificially created.
In that way, several UE metrics can be measured: throughput with RX-DIV, TRP,
TIS (Total isotropic sensitivity), etc.
For each point of the Rayleigh distribution created by the different
configurations of the chamber, the metric is noted. This method can be used to
measure UE sensitivity and UE radiated power.

## 9.2 Lessons learnt and conclusions
After round robin testing campaign the following conclusions have been reached
and agreed, and taken as lessons learnt:
Test Result Agreement within a Methodology
● Anechoic chamber based OTA typically shows good level of agreement when
using UMi and UMa channel propagation models.
● Reverberation chamber based OTA typically shows good level of agreement when
using NIST, UMi and UMa channel propagation models.
● Uncertainties in the measurements and different lab setups prevent full
comparison in some cases.
● It can be seen from the comparison that Nokia's two stage results and
Agilent two-stage results from Pool 4 USB-dongle are comparable with a 3dB
difference. One possible reason for the difference related to measurement
setup is that the Nokia setup selected cross polarized BS antennas and the
Agilent setup selected uncorrelated BS antennas. Apart from this difference
the setups should be comparable and any difference in results likely to be due
to the achievable accuracy of calibration between two separate labs.In some
cases, results within a methodology were corrupted by inadvertent errors in
test equipment settings or changes to the DUT's operating environment.
Test Result Agreement between Methodologies
● Results show that several test methods were proven to be able to show a
clear ranking between DUTs.
● In several cases, very good agreement between anechoic (multiprobe, single
cluster and two-channel methods), reverberation chamber and two-stage results
were observed for a single device, however uncertainties in the measurements
and in the labs setups prevent to take any conclusion regarding any inter-
methodology comparison.
● For some other test cases, big differences among the test method results are
still to be further understood.
● It's not obvious as to how different methodologies can be directly compared
due to the fact that there are many different variables between the methods.
The following issues were identified which made a true comparison difficult:
● Test configuration issues: lack of clearly defined test environment (Base
Station antenna correlation settings, channel model details, not all labs had
access to all DUTs, and DUT configuration varied between labs.
● Reference UE issues: Instability of DUTs over test duration, laptop noise
affected throughput results, and receiver (antenna and baseband)
characteristics of each test UE were unknown so difficult to verify
specifically what caused differences in results.
● Propagation Environment Aspects: SCME channel models are two-dimensional
only; maybe there are (or there will be) more appropriate channel models for
us to consider, 1 drop/instance of a channel model unlikely to be enough to
verify real-world performance.
● Test equipment aspects: eNode B emulators were not mature and even today
labs have found UE performance differences between them.
It is understood to be feasible to specify a test methodology to measure
multiple antenna receiver performance, but the different types of methods need
further technical analysis before agreement can be made on what
methodology(ies) are finally selected.
In chapter 10, recommendations are given on how to scope the work so that the
standardization of a method (s) can progress in the most effective and
efficient way.
# 10 Recommendations
Recommendation is to close current SI and open a WI which basically will take
all the lessons learnt in the SI phase in order to conclude in a method (s)
able to accurately provide MIMO OTA performance that is meaningful compared to
MIMO end user experience.
After Round Robin testing campaign it has been proven that the different
candidate methodologies are able to provide a measure of MIMO OTA performance,
nevertheless it is recognized that there are a number of pending issues that
need to be technically treated in order to be able to conclude a final test
methodology(ies). The following list of items are suggested to be considered
within the scope of the WI:
1\. The initial focus shall be on over-the-air testing of LTE MIMO terminals
(with expansion to LTE SIMO and HSPA SIMO/MIMO afterwards).
2\. Deploy reference antennas and reference device(s)
a. Realize and validate reference antennas
b. Agree on a reduced set of devices to be tested across all labs.
c. Reference devices will be selected such that they represent as well several
chipset manufacturers.
3\. Create reference environment (standardization of RF environment):
a. RF environment shall consider all key radio link aspects, including, for
example, downlink power levels, SNR, (e)Node B transmission modes, reference
channel types and channel rank. In order to minimize variables and uncertainty
during the initial phase, tests shall use of LTE Transmission Mode 3, Fixed
Reference Channel, and forced Rank 2.
b. Standardize eNB, channel emulator
i. Agree on eNodeB emulator settings (begin with same s/w version, MCS
settings, etc.). emulator parameters shall be evaluated and standardized for
MIMO OTA performance evaluation, ensuring alignment with the configurations
used in real-life deployments.
ii. Define BS antenna parameters
iii. Standardize channel emulator, validation of channel emulator.
c. Use channel model from TR
i. Clearly select the channel models from the TR and specify all the
parameters used to ensure consistent test results within and across
methodologies. The selection shall be done to reflect likely field conditions.
ii. Therefore, validation procedures shall be developed to ensure that any
given channel model has been correctly implemented within each methodology.
d. Utilize reference antennas in combination with a known UE baseband receiver
(verified via conducted RF tests with and without channel impairments). This
is intended to verify whether the characteristics of the receive antenna
design (i.e. correlation, gain imbalance, etc) affecting receiver performance
can be accurately distinguished by proposed test methods
i. Measure conducted reference sensitivity unimpaired.
ii. Measure conducted performance (power and noise levels need to be defined)
using an agreed channel model with direct connections (no antenna impact).
iii. Measure conducted performance (power and noise levels need to be defined)
using simulated or measured reference antenna and agreed channel model.
e. Validate channel model implementation in chamber
4\. Simulation of expected UE performance in chosen channel model
5\. Identify the repeatability, reliability and level of measurement
uncertainty of each proposed methodology.
6\. Evaluate the use of statistical performance analysis in order to minimize
test time and help ensure accurate performance assessment.
7\. Consider whether any additional MIMO performance metrics are necessary.
8\. For a final selection of the method(s) cost, time and other implications
should be considered.
Also it is noted that the standardisation of multiple test methodologies may
be one eventual outcome but, during the WI, RAN4 shall avoid fragmentation of
the absolute measurement result that is output as part of the 3GPP test
framework for any given tested device. 3GPP shall also ensure that all devices
can be comparably tested. Currently throughput is the figure of merit to be
used as to compare the different results across the different methods.
Absolute throughput is agreed as the only figure of merit that will be used
for comparable testing across different methods.
###### ## Annex A (Informative): Test Plan for Anechoic Chamber based
candidate methodologies with 3 or more probe antennas
# A.1 Introduction
This annex describes the test plan for OTA throughput comparison measurements.
This test plan is focused on anechoic chamber based methodologies with 3 or
more probe antennas. The plan has previously been presented in COST2100 and
CTIA.
The aim of the comparison measurement campaign is to study how well an OTA
throughput measurement in a predefined propagation channel can be reproduced
in different labs. Testing time and challenges in system calibration are also
matters of interest. There is a risk that labs participating in the
measurement campaign use different setups, different channel model
realizations, and different Node-B Emulator settings. This may lead into some
inconsistent results. Therefore, the goal of this test plan is to define the
radio channel conditions and the throughput measurement in such detail that
the results are as comparable as practically possible.
To be able to compare throughput results between labs one of the challenges of
this test plan has been to define an absolute power level in the center of the
test volume of the used chamber.
One of the important aspects for further study is to implement horizontal
polarization to the test system. Because the aim of this contribution was to
study calibration and repeatability, it was left out. However to create a
realistic radio channel to the chamber, both vertical and horizontal
polarizations have to be taken in to account.
# A.2 Test setup
Testing is done in an anechoic chamber. A number of vertically polarized
antennas are located in a horizontal plane in respect to the UE. The typical
number of antennas is at least eight in a full circle and at least three for a
single cluster test. The probe distance from the UE will vary from lab to lab.
The fading channel is generated by using a channel emulator/simulator which is
fed by a Node-B Emulator. The UE will be rotated around its vertical centre
line by using a turntable or manually. Figure A.2-1 depicts the test setup.
The requirement on the probe antenna is FFS.
{width="3.895138888888889in" height="2.8506944444444446in"}
Figure A.2-1: Test Setup (Communication Tester here means Node-B Emulator)
## A.2.1 Calibration
The test system shall be calibrated using the setup in Figure A.2.1-1. The UE
is replaced by a reference antenna with known gain characteristics. A CW non-
faded calibration signal is fed to one probe at a time and received by the
reference antenna. Based on the known properties of the reference antenna, the
path loss from the input of the channel emulator to the UE location will be
calculated.
The settings (except fading model) of the channel emulator during the
calibration and measurement phases should be identical. The channel model used
in the calibration is static propagation conditions (1 tap, no fading, max.
output power). Signal is routed to one probe antenna at a time. Each path
(antenna probe) is calibrated separately.
{width="3.4305555555555554in" height="2.71875in"}
Figure A.2.1-1: Calibration Setup (VNA stands for Vector Network Analyzer)
Calibration steps:
\- Measure the attenuation between points A and B through each probe. Point A
is the input to the channel emulator and point B is the UE location
represented by the reference antenna.
\- Compensate for path loss differences. This can be done for example by
adjusting the channel emulator outputs by the factor:
where
$\text{Path}_{\text{compensation}_{i}}$ is the compensation factor for probe i
to be adjusted by channel emulator.
$\text{Attn}_{i}$ is the measured attenuation via probe i, and,
$\text{max}(\text{Attn})$ is the highest attenuation over all probes.
\- Calculate the path loss of each route as follows:
### A.2.1.1 Calibration Check
A UE sensitivity measurement is performed for each probe antenna using the
static propagation conditions model. The result of this check can be used to
verify that the probe antennas have been properly calibrated.
Configure the test system according to section B.3 with the following
exceptions:
1) The channel model is single tap, non faded
2) Only one probe antenna is used at a time
Rotate the UE using an angle step of 45° and measure the UE reference
sensitivity which is the highest transmit power resulting in a throughput of
between 1499 kbps and 1999 kbps for each probe antenna. Note: These throughput
values are for H-Set 3, 16QAM. For H-Set 6, the values are FFS.
For each probe and angle of rotation, record the UE reference sensitivity in
Table A.2.1.1-1.

The path loss compensation is considered successful if the path average
results are within ±1 dB.
## A.2.2 Radio Channel Conditions
The desired radio channel models are the same as described in the main part of
this TR (subclause 6.2). The recommended sub-set of channel models for
anechoic chamber based measurements are listed below.
For full circle testing:
● SCME Urban micro-cell,
● SCME Urban macro-cell, and
For single cluster testing:
● Single Spatial Cluster Model with Multi-path based on SCME Urban micro-cell,
or
● Single Cluster Multi-Path Model based on Extended Pedestrian A (EPA)
The channel model used in the test is independent of implementation. When/if
the sum of sinusoids based implementation of SCME channel models is used, the
number of sub-paths per cluster is 20.
NOTE: The Doppler spectrum is based on the geometry (AoA and DoT).
### A.2.2.1 Average channel power
During the calibration phase the static propagation condition was used with
one probe antenna at a time.
For the measurement phase using faded channel conditions, the signal is
transmitted via several probe antennas at a time. Therefore, the per-path
calibration information gained from the path loss measurements needs to be
used to adjust the signal level when using multiple antennas and a fading
channel.
Composite loss is the loss between point A and point B. The average channel
power is defined as the signal level in the centre of the probe array
(location B). The power at location B is the sum of signal powers via a number
of calibrated probe antennas. The total power should be determined for each
channel model separately. The average channel power at location B is the
Node-B Emulator output power (location A) minus the composite loss. The
average channel power level is defined to be the measured power in the centre
of the probe array, averaged over 30 seconds, for the selected channel model
when a HSDPA link is applied. [An example step by step procedure is necessary
to explain how to take the calibrated individual static paths from the
calibration phase and turn this into a calibrated composite faded signal at
point B. The example step by step procedure will be completed by proponents].

## A.3 Test Procedure
The following UE device detail refers only to the COST2100 measurement
campaign.
The USB modem will be tested with the provided laptop. Due to practical
reasons the lid is kept closed during measurements. The laptop has two USB
ports, use the one close to the lid for testing i.e. the higher one. The
laptop will be powered by battery and following power management settings
should be used:
Turn off monitor - never
Turn off hard disks - never
System standby - never
WLAN and Bluetooth radios -- off
## A.3.1 HSDPA connection settings
Working assumptions:
1) HSDPA category 8
2) FRC (Fixed Reference Channel) H-Set 3 (16QAM)
3) Single Link Performance
4) DL channel 10562 is used for testing. Other DL channels can also be used,
but this needs to be described in the measurement report.
### A.3.1.1 FRC
H-Set3 from 34.121-1 is chosen as the FRC. During the FRC tests the behaviour
of the Node-B Emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the HS-
DPCCH is specified in Table A.3.1.1-1.

## A.3.2 Method of test

###### ## Annex B (Informative): LTE MIMO OTA Test Plan
# B.1 Test Objectives
1) To measure a set of figure of merits by using the same reference DUTs for
the candidate methodologies,
2) To compare the OTA figure of merits results between the candidate
methodologies, and
3) To determine and prove whether the candidate test methodology can be used
to differentiate a good and bad DUT
# B.2 Test Setup
The test system setup is shown in Figure B.2 for the proposed methodologies in
6.3. For anechoic chamber based methodologies in Figure B.2-1, a number of
vertically and horizontally polarized antennas are located on a plane with
respect to the DUT. The typical number of antennas is at least eight in a full
circle and at least three for a single cluster test. The antenna probes'
distance from the DUT, {width="0.11388888888888889in" height="0.125in"}, will
vary from lab to lab. In the candidate solution 4 typically two antennas will
be used. The DUT will be rotated around its centre line by using the
electronically-controlled turntable system or using a manual turning approach.
The angle of turning is designated as {width="0.125in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}. An anechoic chamber of sufficient size
({width="0.38472222222222224in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}) m is used and
this will vary from lab to lab. Some uplink signal amplifier may be used to
ensure good isolation between Tx and Rx port of eNodeB emulator.
{width="5.997222222222222in" height="3.772222222222222in"}
Figure B.2-1: Anechoic-chamber based methodologies
Figure B.2-2 shows the setup for the reverberation-chamber based
methodologies. Several measurement antennas can be used to transmit the RF
signals to the DUT. The DUT is inserted in a position inside the chamber. The
mode stirrers are used to create scattering waves that mimic certain
propagation conditions. The uplink antennas are used to establish active
communication link between the eNodeB emulator and the DUT. A reverberation
chamber is equipped with mode stirrers and can create a statistically
isotropic distribution of incoming waves to the UE (User Equipment). When in
the isotropic mimic, there are no restrictions for aligning the UE in a
certain direction, but the UE must be placed at a minimum distance of 0.7
wavelengths from any other conducting object or RF absorbing material in the
chamber. The reverberation chamber may be loaded with absorbing objects in
order to tune the power-delay-profile to fit the channel models described
below.
{width="5.1125in" height="2.186111111111111in"}
Figure B.2-2: MIMO measurement setup for baseline configuration with
reverberation chamber only. Several measurement antennas can be used to
transmit the RF signals to the DUT
{width="5.111111111111111in" height="2.1875in"}
Figure B.2-2A: MIMO measurement setup for extended configuration with
reverberation chamber paired with channel emulator.
The measurement setup with reverberation chamber can be combined with a
channel emulator to produce more specific power delay profiles. Figure B.2-2A
shows the measurement setup with added channel emulator. Configuration of the
channel emulator and the reverberation chamber is slightly different from the
reverberation chamber alone. Note that the intent is to mimic the channel
model created by the emulator as much as possible. Since the chamber
introduces its own decaying exponential PDP, the chamber must be tuned to as
low a delay spread as possible without compromising the desired statistics.
Provisionally, 90 ns has been selected as the target value. For everything
else related to the setup in the reverberation chamber, the same
considerations as in the previous section about reverberation chamber only
should be followed.
For the two-stage methodologies shown in Figure B.2-3, this method divides the
MIMO OTA test into two stages:
1) Measure the device antenna pattern inside an anechoic chamber. In order to
accurately measure the antenna pattern of the intact device, the chipset needs
to support amplitude and relative phase measurements of the antennas. Section
B.4.3 gives a description on how to measure each antenna element's pattern
using a non-intrusive method.
2) Use a commercial MIMO channel emulator to convolve the measured antenna
pattern with the desired channel model to provide the stimulus for a conducted
throughput test on the DUT.
The chamber for antenna pattern measurement is set up as described in Annex
A.2 of [4], where the DUT is put into a chamber and each antenna element's far
zone pattern is measured. The influence of human body loss can be measured by
attaching the DUT to a SAM head and or hand when doing the antenna pattern
measurements. The antenna pattern can be measured using non-intrusive methods
as described in B.4.3. The integrated channel model with both MIMO antenna
effect and the multipath channel effect can then be emulated with a commercial
MIMO channel emulator. The Node B emulator is connected to the MIMO channel
emulator and then to the MIMO device's temporary antenna ports via approved RF
cables. These ports are the standard ones provided for conducted conformance
tests. By controlling the power settings of the channel emulator and also the
integrated channel model, the end-to-end throughput with the MIMO antenna
radiation influence can be measured.

c) The DUT is capable of measuring complex antenna pattern data (i.e. both
magnitude and phase) for both antennas used in the reception of LTE signals. A
diagnostic tool may be used to capture the data. Devices that connect to the
USB port of the laptop shall be connected directly to a USB port on the left
or right side of the laptop.
d) PC running test automation software.
## B.2.1 Figure of Merits (FOMs)
The figure of merits or test parameters in Table B.2.1-1 must be measured.

CQI -- Channel Quality Indicator (This FOM is optional but where possible it
should be measured)
From the FOMs, the second-order statistics can also be derived to assess the
OTA performance of the DUT. For OTA throughput, the PDF and CDF of throughput
should be generated.
## B.2.2 Channel Models
The desired radio channel models that can be used for the measurement campaign
are described in 6.2. The recommended sub-set of channel models for the
measurement campaign is listed below:
For full circle testing:
• SCME Urban micro-cell,
• SCME Urban macro-cell, and
For single cluster testing:
• Single Spatial Cluster Model with Multi-path based on SCME Urban micro-cell
(Angle spread : 35 deg)
• Single Cluster Multi-Path Model based on Extended Pedestrian A (EPA) (Angle
spread : 35 deg)
For uniform model testing:
● Extended Pedestrian A (EPA)
The channel model used in the test is independent of implementation. When/if
the sum of sinusoids based implementation of SCME channel models is used, the
number of sub-paths per cluster is 20. The Doppler spectrum is based on the
geometry (AoA and DoT). The mobile speed of the channel models is 3 km/h.
The candidate solution 4 (two-channel method) does not require a channel model
to be applied.
## B.2.3 Antenna Probes
This setup is only applicable to anechoic-chamber based methodologies.
The measurement antennas or antenna probes should be based on orthogonally
polarised antennas that are capable of transmitting the vertical and
horizontal component of the RF transmitted signals.
Different types of antenna probes can be used, depending on the test
methodology. However, antenna probes should be able to support the 3GPP LTE
frequency bands, at various centre frequencies. The number of antenna probes
needed in an anechoic chamber will depend on the methodology employed.
For measurement campaign purpose, the antenna probes should be calibrated
where possible and the following additional information about the antenna
probes should be recorded:
● The antenna pattern of the antenna probes.
● The cross-polarisation of the antenna probes. The cross-polarisation of an
antenna probe is defined using Cross Polarisation Purity
(AntennaCrossPolarisation). AntennaCrossPolarisation is used to ensure
quality/controllability of polarisation effect. The vertical and horizontal
gain component of antenna probe can be measured separately or simultaneously
to define the XPR. The cross polarisation of the measurement antennas should
be ≥20 dB for the operating carrier frequency.
● The mutual coupling between vertical and horizontal antenna probe element.
The mutual coupling between horizontal and vertical antenna probe element
should be minimised (1 dB).
For the round robin measurement campaign, measurements have to be done for
horizontal and vertical polarization of the probe antennas. If applicable,
mixing polarizations for different antennas is recommended as an additional
test. This test will be especially important to verify performance for
polarization diversity transmissions.
## B.2.4 eNodeB Emulator Parameter Settings
The eNodeB emulator parameters are set according to the Table B.2.4.1-2.
Testing with 64QAM is considered to be done optionally. The settings for DL

The reference DUTs shall be treated as commercial off-the-shell MIMO devices.
The test SIM requirement to establish the communication links between DUT and
the BS emulator should be provided by each proponent of methodology. The SIMs

# B.3 Calibration of Test System
## B.3.1 Calibration Procedure for Anechoic-chamber based methodologies
The calibration procedure is composed of following three steps.
1\. Probe power calibration
2\. Channel power calibration
3\. Calibration check
### B.3.1.1 Probe power calibration
The test system shall be calibrated using the setup in Figure B.3.1-1. The UE
is replaced by a reference antenna (shown in green) with known gain
characteristics. A CW non-faded calibration signal is fed to one probe at a
time and received by the reference antenna. Based on the known properties of
the reference antennas, the pathloss from the input of the fading emulator to
the UE location will be calculated.
The settings (except fading model) of the channel emulator during the
calibration and measurement phases should be identical. The channel model used
in the calibration is static propagation conditions (1 tap, no fading, maximum
channel output power). Signal is routed to one antenna probe at a time. Each
path (antenna probe) is calibrated separately.
{width="4.567361111111111in" height="1.9881944444444444in"}
Figure B.3.1-1: Probe Power Calibration Setup
The calibration steps are given as follows:
1) Measure the attenuation between points A and B (shown in Figure B.3.1-1)
through the antenna probe. Point A is the input to the channel emulator and
point B is the UE location represented by the reference antenna for the first
polarization. The reference antenna has to be aligned with the antenna probe
in order to have the antenna probe within the main lobe of the reference
antenna, and with the correct polarization.
2) Calculate pathloss compensation factor as below:
{width="2.1034722222222224in" height="0.25in"}
where
{width="0.9583333333333334in" height="0.25in"} is the compensation factor for
antenna probe _i_ to be adjusted by channel emulator.
{width="0.3333333333333333in" height="0.20833333333333334in"} is the measured
attenuation via antenna probe _i_ , and,
{width="0.6354166666666666in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}is the highest
attenuation over all antenna probes.
3) Adjust the channel emulator outputs by the compensation factor.
4) Calculate the pathloss of each route as follows:
{width="2.0in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}
where {width="0.6972222222222222in" height="0.23958333333333334in"} is the
reference antenna gain.
5) Repeat the above procedure for the other polarization.
### B.3.1.2 Channel power calibration
During the calibration phase the static propagation channel condition is used
with one probe antenna at a time. For the measurement phase using faded
channel conditions, the signal is transmitted via several probe antennas at a
time. Therefore, the per-path calibration information gained from the pathloss
measurements needs to be used to adjust the signal level when using multiple
antennas and a fading channel.
The composite loss is the loss between point A and point B, as shown in Figure
B.3.1-2. The average channel power is defined as the measured signal power
level in the center of the probe array (Point B) using an omnidirectional
reference antenna for the vertical or the horizontal polarization
respectively. The power at location B is the sum of signal powers via a number
of calibrated probe antennas and averaged over 30 seconds. The total power
should be determined for each channel model, and polarization separately. The
average channel power at Point B is also the eNodeB Emulator output power
(Point A) minus the composite loss. The average channel power at the reference
antenna for both vertical and horizontal polarization should be set as the
target received power respectively, for example -60 dBm for the initial power
for each polarization.
{width="4.5375in" height="2.308333333333333in"}
Figure B.3.1-2: Channel Power Calibration Setup
### B.3.1.3 Calibration check
In order to verify that each antenna probe has been properly calibrated, a UE
sensitivity measurement is performed for each antenna probe using the static
propagation channel model. The result of this check can be used to verify that
the probe antennas have been properly calibrated.
The test system is configured as in Figure B.1-1 according to the test
procedure described in the "**Test Procedure** " section below, but with the
following exceptions:
1) The channel model is a single tap and non-faded (AWGN) channel.
2) Only one probe antenna is used at a time.
Rotate the UE using an angle step,{width="0.125in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} of 45° and measure the UE reference
sensitivity. For each antenna probe and angle of step,{width="0.125in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}, and polarization, record the UE reference
sensitivity in Table B.3.1-1.

where {width="0.125in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} is the rotation angle,
{width="0.23958333333333334in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}= 8 for angle
step of 45°, and,

reference sensitivity for each angle step {width="0.125in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}.
The pathloss compensation is considered successful if the path average results
are within ±1 dB.
## B.3.2 Calibration Procedure for Reverberation-chamber based methodologies
The calibration of reverberation-chamber based methodologies should be based
on Appendix E.3 in [11], which has been devised to support SISO-type device
OTA measurement.
For MIMO OTA, additional considerations on calibration procedure of
reverberation-chamber based methodologies should be made. The S-parameters
should be obtained using the standard vector network analyser that can support
multiple port connections. These S-parameters are
{width="3.145138888888889in" height="0.20833333333333334in"}
for {width="0.19791666666666666in" height="0.22847222222222222in"}measurement
antenna installed inside the chamber. _N_ is the total number of stirrer
positions.
During the calibration, several essential parameters should be recorded:
Chamber Q-factor or average power received from a lossless antenna,
propagation channel-related parameters such as RMC delay, coherence bandwidth
and Doppler spread. A proposed calibration setup for reverberation chamber
type methodologies is shown in Figure B.3.2-1.
{width="4.621527777777778in" height="2.245138888888889in"}
Figure B.3.2-1: Generic setup for calibration measurement in reverberation
chamber
### B.3.2.1. Tuning Reverberation Chamber to Specific Channel Model
Since the power-delay-profile (PDP) in a reverberation chamber can take the
shape of exponential decay, the RMS delay spread is the only parameter needed
to characterize the chamber PDP. From calibration data the RMS delay spread of
the current setup can be calculated. This should be used to tune the RMS delay
spread to what is specified.
For tuning of the reverberation chamber to a specific radio channel condition,
the RMS delay spread can be calculated in either of two ways. The first
alternative is the direct method where the frequency response of the chamber
is Fourier transformed to the time domain and a standard calculation of RMS
delay spread is performed on the time domain data. The second alternative is
the simplified method where the relationship between RMS delay spread,
coherence bandwidth, and average power transfer function of the chamber is
used. The relationship between RMS delay spread and average power transfer
function of the chamber is given by
#### B.3.2.2.1 Reverberation Chamber Combined with Channel Emulator
For the case when a channel emulator is used in combination with a
reverberation chamber, the total power available for the UE is dependent on
the output power available from the channel emulator.
The calibration of the reverberation chamber part of the system should be
carried out as stated in the section above about calibration of the
reverberation chamber only. The total path loss should then be adjusted so as
to appropriately account for the channel emulator path loss.
### B.3.2.2 Average Path Loss Measurement
Based on Figure B.3.1-3 and Appendix E.3 in Error: Reference source not
found[11], the following calibration procedure can be used:
1) Place all objects, which will be used during the measurements, into the RC.
These objects could include a head phantom, hand phantom and fixture for the
EUT, if applicable. The purpose of this step is to ensure that the loss in the
chamber is the same during both calibration and measurements later.
2) Place the calibration or reference antenna inside the RC. The calibration
antenna is preferably mounted on a low-loss dielectric fixture, to avoid
effects from the fixture itself which may affect the EUT's radiation
efficiency and mismatch factor. The calibration antenna must be placed in the
chamber in such a way that it is far enough from any walls, mode-stirrers,
head phantom, or other object, such that the environment for the calibration
antenna (taken over the complete stirring sequence) resembles a free space
environment. "Far enough away" depends on the type of calibration antenna
used. For low-gain, nearly omni-directional antennas like dipoles it is
normally sufficient to ensure that this spacing is larger than 0.5
wavelengths. More directive calibration antennas should be directed towards
the center of the chamber.
3) Connect the first fixed measurement antenna and measure the S-parameters
between port of fixed measurement antenna and the calibration antenna. The
network analyser should be calibrated (by manufacturer) so that the
S-parameter can be measured accurately.
4) Repeat Step 3 for each stirrer position and carrier frequency.
5) Connect the next fixed measurement antenna and repeat Step 3 -- 4.
6) Repeat Step 5 until all the fixed measurement antennas have been installed
and calibrated in the chamber.
Note that the frequency dependency of the S-parameters is suppressed in this
formulation. The number of stirrer positions _N_ in the chosen stirring
sequence, i.e. the number of S-parameter samples at each frequency point,
should be chosen in such a way that it is large enough to yield an acceptable
statistical contribution to the total measurement uncertainty. As a guideline
it should be in the range of 200 -- 400 to ensure that the number of
independent samples is not severely limited by the total number of samples
measured. The number of independent samples, which is a subset of all samples,
determines the statistical contribution to the expanded measurement
uncertainty. This should be larger than 100 to ensure an expanded uncertainty
less than 1 dB.
Note also that the number of independent samples depends on the frequency,
size of chamber, quality of stirrers, the level of loading by absorbing
objects, and whether or not frequency stirring is used. A good chamber can
provide 100 independent samples down to a lower frequency of operation than a
bad chamber. The sequence of moving the stirrers to different positions may be
either step-wise (stopping stirrer for each sample) or continuous (sampling
on-the-fly). With continuous stirring it may not be possible to characterize
the chamber over a wide frequency band at the same time.
An uplink signal amplifier may be required to ensure good isolation between Tx
and Rx port of eNodeB emulator.
## B.3.3 Calibration Procedure for 2-Stage methodologies
### B.3.3.1 Antenna pattern measurement calibration in stage I
The DUT antenna patterns are measured in a calibrated certified anechoic
chamber. The anechoic chamber constraints can be found in Annex A.2 in [4].
The preferred measurement is based on the assumption that the chipset in
device has the capability to support amplitude and relative phase measurements
of the antennas. Less integrated devices such as those providing cabled access
to the antenna and receiver After the antenna pattern measurement using non-
intrusive methods as described in B.4.3, the antenna pattern absolute gain
calibration is carried out by using a reference dipole with known gain to
measure the path loss, which means that the path loss is calibrated out from
the measured pattern. The detailed path loss {width="0.19791666666666666in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} calibration process is as below, which is from
Annex B in [4].
**Path loss calibration process**
{width="0.3333333333333333in" height="0.25in"} is the attenuation between P
and B, see figure B.3-1.
{width="1.6145833333333333in" height="0.25in"}
Where {width="0.2916666666666667in" height="0.25in"} is cable loss from A to
B. The cable AC connecting the substitution antenna should be such that its
influence upon radiation pattern measurements is minimal.
{width="0.2708333333333333in" height="0.22916666666666666in"} is the
attenuation between points A and B. {width="0.2916666666666667in"
height="0.25in"} is the efficiency or gain of the calibration antenna at the
frequency of interest.
{width="6.503472222222222in" height="3.0833333333333335in"}
Figure B.3.3.1-1 Calibration/substitution procedures using a vector network
analyzer from Annex B in TS 34.114 V.9.0.0
If the calibration is based on known efficiency of the calibration antenna, a
full spherical scanning is performed to determine{width="0.2708333333333333in"
height="0.22916666666666666in"}.
This procedure has to be done at each frequency of interest.
To achieve measurements with an uncertainty as low as possible, it is
absolutely necessary to exactly keep the same P to B configuration (cables,
dual-polarized antenna and cables positions, etc).
Calibration shall be performed yearly or if any equipment in the measurement
system is changed.

Figure B.3.3.2-1 Calibration antenna pattern change introduced by test
platform
Before carrying the throughput measurement in stage II, we should calibrate
out the antenna pattern change introduced by the test platform. The
calibration process is below:
1) Set up the conducted throughput test platform as shown in Figure B.3-2.
2) Load antenna pattern measured in chamber into channel emulator, and
configure the channel to one Line of Sight (LOS) path without fading.
3) Using device's non-intrusive pattern measurement capability to measure the
emulated pattern under this connection and compare this result with the loaded
one to get the pattern change introduced by test platform
4) Compensate the pattern change from the original pattern file to get the
calibrated pattern file, and make sure the measured pattern from this test
platform is same as that measured in the chamber. Assume the original pattern
measured in chamber is A, and the measured emulated-pattern under cable
connection in step 3 is B, then the compensated pattern should be A + (A -- B)
### B.3.3.3 Power calibration for results comparison from different OTA test
methods
To meaningfully compare the throughput results for different MIMO OTA test
methods, it is essential to ensure the incident power level is independent of
the test method. Using the multi-probe test method as an example: the
reference power is defined as the total received power on the minimum sphere
surface surrounding the DUT antenna. The transmitted power is measured from
the i^th^ probe antenna over all N antennas as P~i~, and the measured path
loss between each probe antenna and the DUT as P~loss~ (this method can be
found in Vodafone, "Detailed Test Plan of MIMO/multiple receiver antennas OTA
measurement campaign for COST2100 and CTIA"). The total received power on the
minimum sphere surface surrounding the DUT antenna
is{width="0.4270833333333333in" height="0.2076388888888889in"}.To compare the
two-stage method results with the multi-probe method, the power at the
temporary antenna connectors is set to be the same as would have been received
when using the multi-probe method.

Figure B.3.4-1: Generic setup for calibration measurement in anechoic chamber
1) Set up: An anechoic chamber with signal generator, reference antenna
supporting the test frequencies of interest, probe antenna as shown in Figure
B.3.4-1. Free space path loss from point A to point B can be measured using
measurement methods described in CTIA OTA Test Plan version 3.0, section 4
[2].
2) The UE is replaced by a reference antenna with known gain characteristics.
A CW non-faded calibration signal is fed to the probe antenna and received by
the reference antenna. Based on the known properties of the reference antenna,
the pathloss from the input of the the UE location will be calculated.
3) Repeat this measurement for both horizontal and vertical polarization path
losses and record these values. Use these values to account for the path loss
from the Node B emulator to the DUT.
## B.3.5 Calibration Procedure for two-channel method
The calibration in the case of candidate solution 4 (two-channel method) is
similar to the calibration of power levels in the SISO case. Attenuation of
cables as well as free space attenuation are measured to determine the path
loss between an RF output of the eNodeB emulator and the output of an ideally
isotropic radiator placed at the centre of the quiet zone. The radiator is co-
polarized with the utilized test antenna. The measurement can be achieved
using a signal generator, a power meter and a calibrated reference antenna,
for example.
The attenuation values obtained by means of this method are then used in the
following way:
For the power level at the quiet zone due to antenna 1, the power level of the
eNodeB emulator is taken and the total attenuation for that path is subtracted
in order to obtain the power level at the UE's position. Since there are
usually different paths involved, one for each polarization, the correction
for the appropriate polarization has to be taken.
The power level at the quiet zone due to antenna 2 then is set to the same
level by adjusting the power level in the eNodeB emulator. The power level
going into the first antenna is taken and shifted by the difference in
attenuations of the two paths involved.
The resulting uncertainty is determined by the uncertainty of the attenuation
measurement and the uncertainty of the eNodeB emulator output.
# B.4 Test Procedure
## B.4.1 Test Procedure 1
The following test procedure is used to measure MIMO throughput and CQI given
in Table B.2.1-1. The FOM is measured by varying the average channel power.
The steps for doing that are shown below:
1) Set up fading test conditions defined in section B.2 and appropriate probe
antenna polarizations.
2) Establish an LTE connection according to [12] with the UE in angular
position 0 degrees.
3) Ensure and check that the eNodeB emulator behaviour is according to Table
B.2.4.1-1.
4) Set eNodeB emulator parameters according to Table B.2.4.1-2 depending on
the DUT type.
5) Set up number of subframes to 2000, and repetition to "Single Shot".
6) Adjust the average channel power to a level approximately 1 dB higher than
the point where throughput degradation starts to occur. Record this power
level.\ \ Throughput is calculated with the following formula:
{width="2.6465277777777776in" height="0.38472222222222224in"}
7) Measure the FOM and record the FOM result in a new row below row #21, as
shown in Table B.4.1-1
8) Reduce the power level in steps of 0.5 dB and record the throughput / power
levels accordingly, until the throughput value is less than 10 % of the
maximum throughput of step 6.
9) Rotate the DUT by {width="0.125in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} degrees
and repeat steps 6 to 8 until all rotation angles have been measured
10) Calculate the average value of the FOM for each power step over all
rotation angles.

In addition a test in conducted mode has to be made with similar settings, but
of course using the much smaller attenuation of the conducted setup.
## B.4.1A Test Procedure 1A (Reverberation Chamber Based Methodologies)
1\. Set up the fading conditions defined in Section B.2.
2\. Set the eNodeB behavior according to Table B.2.4.1-2.
3\. Establish a connection according to the settings called for in [12] with
the UE placed in the chamber.
4\. Adjust the output power so that the average power available for the UE is
equal to [-50 dBm].
5\. Measure the average throughput during a full mode-stirrer sequence, with
either step-wise or continuous stirrer movement:
• Step-wise stirring: Sample the throughput in each fixed stirrer position by
using 50 frames for each sample, then calculate the average over the complete
set of samples. The number of samples should be 150 or more.
• Continuous stirring: Set the number of subframes to [5000] and make the
stirrers to move continuously for as long as it takes to measure the
throughput for this number of frames.
> Throughput is calculated with the following formula:
>
> Throughput = Transmitted blocks size × (Number of blocks acknowledged /
> Measuring time)
6\. Repeat steps 6 and 7, each time with a 2 dB lower output power of the
eNodeB until the average throughput is equal to zero or measurement cannot be
continued due to disconnection of the UE.
7\. Record the average power setting and the average throughput measurement at
each repetition of steps 6 and 7.
## B.4.2 Test Procedure 2
The following test procedure is used to measure TRS/TIS given in Table
B.2.1-1. Detailed steps are FFS.
## B.4.3 Test Procedure 3 (Antenna spatial correlation measurement)
The following test procedure is used to measure Spatial correlation, given in
Table B.2.1-1.
For the purposes of the antenna amplitude and relative phase measurement the
conditions under which the measurements are required to operate are in the
received power range of REFSENS + 10 dBm or higher in a static channel with
one dominant angle of arrival..The amplitude and phase measurements should be
computed from the same period of time which should be sufficient for the
result to represent the power and phase of the static signal, with an upper
limit of [10] ms is provisionally proposed FFS. An absolute power accuracy of
+/- [6] dB is considered sufficient for this study phase investigation and the
figure for relative phase accuracy is [2] degrees.
The test setup is according to Figure B.2.4.

1) Set initial position of DUT with respect to probe antenna.
2) Set up eNode B conditions defined in Table B.4.3-1, as per section 7.3.4.1
of [12].
3) Set the downlink signal level to REFSENS + 45 dB, above reference
sensitivity level of DUT.
4) Inner loop power control shall be enabled for the uplink.
5) Establish an LTE connection according to 3GPP 36.521-1 section 7.3.4.2 of
of [12].
6) Enable the DUT to measure complex antenna pattern data, Received for each
DUT receive antenna and the relative phase between the antennas.
The details of the received signal strength and phase measurements are to be
elaborated but at this time it is assumed that these are based on the downlink
RS as a non-limiting example.\ \ [editor's note: Details for complex antenna
pattern data, Received Signal Strength (RSS) and phase and how their obtained
are FFS. Further details shall be provided before test plan for this candidate
method can progress]
7) Rotate the DUT/antenna probe to measure complex antenna pattern data over a
spherical space around the DUT. Data points are taken every 3 degrees in theta
(θ) and phi (φ).
8) Linearize the RSS pattern measurements using the procedure in section
6.16.2 of [9]. The downlink signal strength in shall be adjusted as needed.
9) Extract the measured complex antenna pattern data per each measured theta
(θ) and phi (φ) position.
10) Calculate the antenna correlation coefficient ρ~e~. For each theta (θ) and
phi (φ), indexed as i and j for discrete elevation and azimuth positions, the
antenna correlation coefficient, ρ~e~ can be calculated using the following
expressions:
For antenna pair (1, 2),
> {width="0.9305555555555556in" height="0.4583333333333333in"}, where
{width="4.75in" height="0.4861111111111111in"}
{width="4.666666666666667in" height="0.4861111111111111in"}
{width="4.777777777777778in" height="0.4861111111111111in"}
Where:
● XPR = cross-polarization ratio (P~V~/P~H~)
● P θ and Pφ are the incident field power densities from the assumed channel
model
● ∆θ and ∆φ are the measurement angular increments
● Nθ and Nφ are the number of angular measurement points in θ and φ assuming
the measurement is made over a sphere of angles.
● θ varies from 0 to π, and φ varies from 0 to 2 π.
And the the antenna correlation coefficient is {width="0.8611111111111112in"
height="0.5in"}
## B.4.4 Test Procedure 4 (Two-stage throughput)
The following test procedure is used to measure OTA throughput and CQI given
in Table B.2.1-1 using the two-stage method.
The FOM is measured by varying the average channel power. Here the power is
not the output power from channel emulator, but is the total received power on
the minimum sphere surface surrounding the DUT antenna, it does not include
antenna gain's influence, which is same as that in multi-probe method and does
not require averaging over angle rotation.The steps are shown below:
1) Measure the amplitude and phase patterns of each element of the DUT antenna
array as defined in B.4.3 and store the results.The path loss calibration as
described in section B.3.4 also should be done in this step.
2) Connect the equipment as shown in Figure B.2-3.
3) Load the measured antenna patterns into the channel emulator, and configure
the desired MIMO channel model defined in section B.2.
4) Configure the eNodeB emulator and establish an LTE connection according to
Vodafone, "Detailed Test Plan of MIMO/multiple receiver antennas OTA
measurement campaign for COST2100 and CTIA with the UE.
5) Perform the antenna pattern calibration described in section B.3.2 to
compensate the pattern change introduced by the test platform, and make sure
after this calibration the emulated pattern from this test platform is same as
that measured in step 1)
6) Ensure and check that the eNodeB emulator behaviour is according to Table
B.2.3.1-1.
7) Set eNodeB emulator parameters according to Table B.2.3.1-2 depending on
the DUT type.
8) Set up number of frames to 5000, and repetition to "Single Shot".
9) Switch on the inner loop power control and ensure power continuously up.
10) Adjust the output power of the channel emulator to achieve roughly 50% of
the maximum throughput and record this power level. The reference power, which
is defined as the total received power on the minimum sphere surface
surrounding the DUT antenna, can be deduced by using this power minus antenna
gain and power loss between channel emulator output port and DUT temporary
antenna connectors.
Throughput is calculated with the following formula:
{width="2.6465277777777776in" height="0.38472222222222224in"}
Transmit Block Size (TBS): defines the transmitted bit number in each block.
If there is a reference power available from a different test method, then
perform the reference power calibration as described in B.3.2. In this case
the throughput measured for the two-stage method can be meaningfully compared
with the throughput for other methods.
11) Set the power to 8 dB below the power level used in step 10.
12) Measure throughput and the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) for each DUT
rotation angle in steps of 45 degrees. The DUT rotation is emulated from
within the channel emulator by rotating measured antenna pattern.
13) Increase the average channel power by 2 dB and repeat step 12 until
measurements have been completed at 8 dB above the power level in step 9.
14) Calculate the average value of the FOM for each power step over all
rotation angles.

## B.4.5 Test Procedure 5 for two-channel method
The following test procedure is used to measure MIMO throughput and CQI given
in Table B.2.1-1. The FOM is measured by varying the PDSCH resource element
power controlled via setting the RS EPRE power. The steps are similar to the
ones in section B.4.1 but with some changes.
1) Set up the paths to the antennas / polarizations to be used for this test,
and select an antenna distance (θ~2~ -- θ~1~) .
2) Establish an LTE connection according to [12] with the turntable at φ = 0
degrees and with antenna 1 at θ~1~ = 0 degrees.
3) Set eNodeB emulator parameters according to Table B.2.4.1-2.
4) Set up number of subframes to 2000, and repetition to "Single Shot".
5) Adjust the power of PDSCH resource elements to a level approximately 1 dB
higher than the point where throughput degradation starts to occur. Record
this power level.\ \ Throughput is calculated with the following formula:
{width="2.6465277777777776in" height="0.38472222222222224in"}
6) Measure the FOM and record the FOM result.
7) Reduce the power level in steps of 0.5 dB and record the throughput / power
levels accordingly, until the throughput value is less than 10 % of the
maximum throughput of step 5.
8) Rotate the antennas by {width="0.125in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}
degrees and repeat steps 5 to 7 until all rotation angles have been measured
9) Calculate the average value of the FOM for each power step over all
rotation angles.
