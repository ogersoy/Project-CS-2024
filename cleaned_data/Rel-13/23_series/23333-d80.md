In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
This specification describes the functional requirements and information flows
that generate procedures between the Multimedia Resource Function Controller
(MRFC) and the Multimedia Resource Function Processor (MRFP), the Mp
Interface.
This specification is limited to information flows relevant to the Mp
Interface; in order to define these procedures and make the functional
requirements clear some triggers from an external interface may be described;
these may be specified within the Mr interface for example or within an AS in
which the MRFC function resides. However for the overall stage 2 procedures of
IMS see 3GPP TS 23.228 [1].
The protocol on the Mp interface is defined to comply with ITU-T H.248.1
Gateway Control Protocol; see [3].The goal of this specification is to provide
the input to defining a formal Profile within the H.248 protocol toolbox
specifically for the Mp application.

# 4 Architecture
The architecture concerning the Multimedia Resource Function is presented in
Figure 4.1 below.
Figure 4.1: Architecture of MRF
The scope of this specification is limited to the area shown within the green
shading.
The MRF is split into Multimedia Resource Function Controller (MRFC) and
Multimedia Resource Function Processor (MRFP).
Tasks of the MRFC may consist of the following:
\- Control the media stream resources in the MRFP.
\- Interpret information coming from an AS and S‑CSCF (e.g. session
identifier) and control MRFP accordingly.
\- Generation of CDRs.
\- Advanced control of conferences (e.g. floor control)
Tasks of the MRFP may consist of the following:
\- Control of the bearer on the Mb reference point.
\- Provide resources to be controlled by the MRFC.
\- Mixing of incoming media streams (e.g. for multiple parties).
\- Media stream source (e.g. for multimedia announcements).
\- Media stream processing (e.g. audio transcoding, media analysis).
\- Manage access rights to shared resources in a conferencing environment
(e.g. floor control).
The Mp reference point allows an MRFC to control media stream resources
provided by an MRFP.
# 5 Functional Requirements
## 5.1 General
All functions are optional. Within a given function some components and
procedures might be optional to still support the function but some will be
required. Normative text in the following clauses thus describes requirements
for support within an optional feature where it is desired to differentiate
between optional and mandatory parts of the feature.
## 5.2 Play Tone
The MRFC shall request the MRFP to send tones to one, one of several, multiple
or all parties connected in a call/session with a given tone identifier for
each specific tone.
The MRFC may request the tone to be played continuously until requested to be
stopped.
The MRFC may include in the request the length of time that the tone shall be
played; the duration may be provisioned.
The MRFC may then request a notification from the MRFP when the tone is
completed.
The MRFC may request DTMF detection while playing a tone.
The MRFC may request that upon DTMF detection the MRFP stops playing a tone.
## 5.3 Play Announcement
The function of playing announcement is to play audio media streams to the
subscriber. The function can be used in services such as audio announcements,
mail box services, play back recorded audio etc.
The MRFC shall request the MRFP to play announcements to one, one of several,
multiple or all parties connected in a call/session.
The announcement may be referenced by identifiers that may be pre-configured,
or dynamically obtained from the same MRFP for example due to Audio Record.
The MRFC shall request sequences of predefined fixed announcements within one
request to the MRFP.
The MRFC may request announcements to be played in a loop until it commands
the MRFP to stop.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to play an announcement for a fixed number of
times.
The MRFC may request DTMF detection while playing an announcement.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to stop playing an announcement when a DTMF
digit is detected.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to add the following variants to the
announcements:
\- Date/Day/Month
\- Time
\- Digits (the announcement may contain a number of digits to be controlled by
the MRFC for example a telephone number)
\- Money (currency)
\- Integer (a value within the announcement that is controlled by the MRFC,
e.g. \"you are caller number 3 in the queue\")
\- Variants may have predefined default values for a given network.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to indicate when a specific announcement
previously requested has been played successfully.
The MRFP shall indicate error cases such as announcement not played
successfully.
## 5.4 Text to Speech
TTS (Text To Speech) is the process of automatic generation of speech output
from text or annotated text input.
The MRFC shall request the MRFP to play the text to one, one of several,
multiple or all parties connected in a call/session.
The text format shall comply with the SSML format as specified in [11].
The MRFC shall extract the SSML script from the VXML or other format XML
script if received
If the received text is another format than SSML, the MRFC shall generate a
SSML script that may include the basic SSML text and the language type.
The MRFC shall indicate to the MRFP the text-to-speech, by sending the SSML
script or sending an URI reference to this SSML script.
If the MRFC indicates the SSML script to the MRFP, the SSML text is sent
inline in a H.248 command of Mp; the size shall be limited to avoid the
segmentation in the Mp interface. The MRFC may remove unnecessary elements,
such as the comments element, from the SSML document, providing that the
result is a Conforming Speech Synthesis Markup Language Fragment as described
in clause 2.2.1 of SSML ref [11]. This is however outside the scope of the
current Mp specification work. If the SSML script size pre-processed results
in segmentation in the Mp interface, the URI reference should be used.
When the MRFC indicates the SSML script using an URI reference to the MRFP,
two options can exist:
\- the file (referenced by the URI) is located in the MRFP and it is a SSML
text, hence the MRFP should play the text;
\- the file (referenced by the URI) is located outside the MRFP; the MRFP may
fetch the text and play it to the user otherwise the MRFP indicates an error.
The MRFP shall execute the basic SSML elements and may ignore the SSML
elements not supported. The basic SSML elements include the root element
\"speak\", language type and spoken text.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to play a text in a loop until it commands the
MRFP to stop.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to play a text for a fixed number of times.
The MRFC may request DTMF detection while playing a text.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to stop playing a text when a DTMF digit is
detected.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to indicate when a text has been played
successfully.
The MRFP shall indicate error cases such as text not played successfully.
Ignoring a non-supported SSML element shall not result in an error.
## 5.5 Audio Record
The function requirement of audio record is to record the audio media
stream(s) and store it into a file. The function can be used in some services,
such as the voice mail box service, conference service, etc.
The MRFC shall request the MRFP to start the audio record from one or all
parties connected in a call/session. If it is to record one party in a
call/session, only the input stream of the party is recorded. If it is to
record all parties in a call/session, the mixed stream of all parties is
recorded.
The MRFP file format shall comply with the 3GPP multimedia file formats as
specified in the 3GPP TS 26.244[5].
The MRFC may request the MRFP to detect the DTMF digit while recording an
audio.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to stop recording and still retain the recording
file.
The MRFC may indicate to the MRFP the file format and the URI to store the
recorded file or request the MRFP to return the record file URI.
The MRFC may indicate to the MRFP the maximum record time.
The MRFC shall request the MRFP to indicate the result and the cause of record
completion when an audio has been recorded successfully.
The MRFP shall indicate error cases such as audio not recorded successfully.
The MRFC may indicate the MRFP to execute other functions, such as playing an
announcement, when the MRFP is recording audio.
## 5.6 DTMF Collection
The MRFC shall request the MRFP to detect and report the DTMF digits.
The MRFP shall report DTMF Digits detected as RTP Telephony Events (see IETF
RFC 2833 [10]) if the Telephony Event for DTMF Payload Type has been assigned
to that interface. The MRFP shall report only single DTMF Digits.
## 5.7 Automatic Speech Recognition
ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) function is that the recognizer processes
the user input voice and may match that input against a target data to produce
a recognition result that represents the detected input. In the IMS, the MRFP
acts as the recognizer that is under control of the MRFC and finish the
function of recognition.
The MRFC shall request the MRFP to start the automatic speech recognition.
The MRFC shall extract the SRGS recognition grammar script or URI from the
VXML script if received or other format XML script if received.
The grammar format shall comply with the SRGS format as specified in W3C
Recommendation [12].
The MRFC shall indicate the SRGS script or the SRGS URI to the MRFP using
H.248 packages. If the SRGS script is sent inline,. the size of the SRGS
script shall be limited to avoid segmentation in the Mp interface.
The MRFC may indicate to the MRFP the recognition mode: Normal Recognition
Mode or Hotword Recognition Mode.
\- If the MRFC indicates the Normal Recognition Mode to the MRFP, the MRFP
shall attempt to match all of the speech against a recognition grammar and
returns a no-match status if the input fails to match or the method times out.
\- If the MRFC indicates the Hot-word Recognition Mode to the MRFP, the MRFP
shall look for a match against specific speech grammar and ignores speech that
does not match. The recognition completes only for a successful match of the
recognition grammar or if the subscriber cancels the request or if the
recognition time elapses.
The MRFP shall execute the recognition against the SRGS grammar and may ignore
SRGS elements which are not supported.
The MRFC may request DTMF detection while executing ASR.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to stop ASR when a DTMF digit is detected.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to indicate when a specific ASR has been
completed successfully.
When ASR is completed successfully, the MRFP may notify the MRFC the
recognition result.
The recognition result shall comply with a single recognition format (e.g. the
EMMA format as specified in W3C Recommendation [13] or the NLSML format as
specified in W3C Recommendation [15]).
NOTE: The mandatory recognition result format may be defined in Stage 3
specification 3GPP TS 29.333 [16].The MRFP may notify the MRFC multiple
recognition results that are mutually exclusive. Each result may be structured
by multiple parts in time sequence with the input time, may include the text
token that the value will correspond to tokens as defined by the SRGS grammar,
may include the interpretation of application specific markup, may include the
confidence score that represents the recognition quality.
The MRFP shall indicate error cases such as ASR not executed successfully.

The MRFP handling of EVS codec parameters shall follow table 5.13.3.3 in 3GPP
TS 23.334 [41]. The MRFP should support transcoding of EVS with bandwidths
(sampling rates) which are supported by codec the MRFP is capable to transcode
EVS to/from (e.g. NB for AMR, and WB for AMR-WB).
## 5.13 Video Transcoding
The MRFP shall support video transcoding between streams of two Terminations
within the same context where the streams are encoded differently, in
accordance with standard H.248 principles, see ITU-T H.248.1 [3].
NOTE: 3GPP video codecs are specified in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23].
## 5.14 Floor Control Service Requirement
### 5.14.1 General
Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to shared
resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment. It enables applications
or users to gain safe and mutually exclusive or non-exclusive input access to
the shared object or resource. The \"Floor\" is an individual temporary access
or manipulation permission for a specific shared resource (or group of
resources) IETF RFC 4376 [19]. Floor control is an optional procedure; where
\"shall\" is used it is meant that this is basic required functionality within
the feature.
### 5.14.2 Architecture
The functional architecture concerning Floor control is presented in Figure
5.14.2.1 below.
Figure 5.14.2.1: Functionality Architecture of Floor Control
The functional entities are described by solid line, and the roles are
described by broken line.
The functional entities consist of the following:
\- User Equipment (UE), a UE shall support the \"Client\" role of BFCP as
specified by IETF RFC 4582 [20]. the Client may be a \"Floor Participant\" or
\"Floor Chair\" .
\- Media Resource Function (MRF), an MRF shall support the \"Floor Control
Server\" role.
The roles consist of the following:
\- Floor Participant, the Floor Participant shall support general Client
operations and Floor Participant operations as described in IETF RFC 4582
[20].
\- Floor Chair, the Floor Chair shall support Client operations and Floor
Chair operations as described in IETF RFC 4582 [20].
\- Floor Control Server, the Floor Control Server (FCS) shall support Floor
Control Server operations as described in IETF RFC 4582 [20].
### 5.14.3 Services Requirements
The MRF shall support the Floor Control function, including: the \"conference
policy\" related to Floor control and the communication between the Floor
control functional entities (the Floor Participant, the Floor Chair and the
Floor Control Server).
1\. The MRF shall support the following Floor control policy related to Floor
control:
\- Whether the Floor control is in use or not.
\- The algorithm to be used in granting the Floor.
The following algorithms shall be supported:
\- FCFS (First Come First Served)
The following algorithms may be supported:
\- Chair-Controlled
\- The maximum number of users who can hold the Floor at the same time.
\- To assign and modify the Floor Chair, if the Floor is Chair-controlled.
The MRF may support the following:
\- Announcements/tones from network for indicating when a user gets and looses
the hold of the Floor (note: announcement may also be text or indication in
video)
2\. The MRF, acting as FCS, shall support the communication with the Floor
Participants and the Floor Chairs according to the BFCP protocol as described
in IETF RFC 4582 [20] , providing:
\- Communication between Floor Participant and FCS such that the participant
shall be able to request/ modify /release a Floor for the Floor Participant
himself or a third-party Floor Participant;
\- Communication between Floor Chair and FCS such that the Chair shall be able
to receive Floor requests and to grant/ reject/ revoke the Floor requests.
### 5.14.4 Information Flows
This clause covers the information flows between the UE and MRF.
#### 5.14.4.1 User requesting the Floor during a conference
Figure 5.14.4.1.1 shows a Floor Participant requesting the Floor to obtain the
right to talk during a conference. The UE#1 is a Floor Participant, the Floor
of the \"right to talk\" is Chair-controlled and the UE#2 is the Floor Chair
of the conference.
Figure 5.14.4.1.1: User requesting the Floor to obtain the right to talk
during a conference
The details of the flows are as follows:
1\. Conference session with UE#1 & UE#2 established
The UE#1 and UE#2 are participants of an existing conference. The BFCP
connections between the participant and the MRF need to be established before
the BFCP communication.
2\. FloorRequest
The UE#1 requests the MRF for the Floor of the \"right to talk\". The message
format is described in IETF RFC 4582 [20].

give up the right to talk during a conference. The UE#1 is a Floor Participant
and owns the Floor of the \"right to talk\", the Floor is Chair-controlled and
the UE#2 is the Floor Chair of the conference.
Figure 5.14.4.2.1: User releasing the Floor to give up the right to talk
during a conference
The details of the flows are as follows:
1\. Conference session with UE#1 & UE#2 established
The UE#1 and UE#2 are participants of an existing conference. The BFCP
connections between the participant and the MRF need to be established before
the BFCP communication.

stream from the MRF only.
### 5.14.5 Requirements on Mp interface
### 5.14.5.1 Requirements for MRFP based FCS
The MRFC shall indicate to the MRFP the Floor Control Policy:
\- The algorithm to be used in granting the Floor.
\- The FCFS algorithm shall be supported.
\- The Chair-controlled algorithm may be supported.
\- The maximum number of users who can hold the same Floor at the same time.
\- To assign and modify the Floor Chair, if the Floor is Chair-controlled.
\- The Floor media type shall be audio, video or a combination of one or more
media type.
\- The association between Floors and resources.
The MRFP shall maintain the state of the Floor(s), including which Floors
exists, which terminations hold which Floors, and which termination is the
Floor Chair, if the floor is Chair-controlled.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to establish a BFCP connection between the MRFP
(FCS) and the Client (via Floor control Client Termination).
The MRFP shall support the communication with a Floor Participant such that
the participant may request/ modify /release a Floor for the Floor Participant
himself or a third-party Floor Participant according to the BFCP protocol
[20].
The MRFP may support the communication with Floor Chair such that the Chair
shall be able to receive Floor requests and to grant/ reject/ revoke the Floor
according to the BFCP protocol [20].
The MRFP shall (if requested by the MRFC) report to the MRFC any requests to
change the Floor holding status. The MRFC shall indicate to the MRFP to modify
the Client\'s access right to the media according to the changes in Floor
status.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to play tones (according to clause 5.1) or
announcements (according to clause 5.2) for indicating when a Client gains or
loses a Floor.
## 5.15 Explicit Congestion Notification Service Requirement
### 5.15.1 General
A MRFC/MRFP may support Multimedia Telephony using Explicit Congestion
Notification see IETF RFC 3168 [24], and may act as an ECN endpoint to enable
ECN with a local ECN-capable terminal within a local network that properly
handles ECN-marked packets.
This requires that the MRFC performs the following:
\- support SDP ability to negotiate ECN as described in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23].
This requires the MRFP to be capable of enabling end-to-end rate adaptation
due to congestion between the local Multimedia Telephony terminal and the MRFP
by performing the following towards the local Multimedia Telephony terminal:
\- trigger rate adaptation request towards the Multimedia Telephony terminal
when receiving incoming IMS media flow IP packets marked with ECN-CE;
\- perform media adaptation (e.g. reduce media bit-rate) towards the
Multimedia Telephony terminal when receiving from the latter an adaptation
request;
\- if requested by the MRFC, provide notification and an ECN failure event if
ECN errors or packet losses occur.
## 5.16 Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) Support
The Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) is specified in 3GPP TS 22.153 [26]. The
MRFC and MRFP may support the priority treatment of a call/session identified
as an MPS call/session. If MPS is supported then upon receipt of the MPS
priority information in the call control signalling:
\- The MRFC shall recognise the call/session as having priority.
\- The MRFC shall send the Priority information for a context to the MRFP to
enable the priority treatment described below related to the MRFP.
\- The MRFC shall apply priority handling to H.248 transactions related to
priority calls/sessions when network resources are congested, e.g.,
preferential treatment in any queues or buffers.
\- If the H.248 control association utilises a transport with the possibility
for prioritisation, the MRFC may apply priority using the appropriate
prioritisation procedures.
\- If the MPS Priority service requires a specific MPS DSCP setting, the MRFC
shall configure the MRFP to apply a specific MPS DSCP marking to the user data
transport packets to indicate that the packets are of a higher priority than
those for normal calls.
\- If the MRFP receives an indication to apply a specific MPS DSCP marking to
the user data transport packets, it shall apply this DSCP marking to the IP
headers.
NOTE 1: Support of Diffserv procedures by the MRFP assumes an operator uses
Diffserv for prioritising user plane traffic related to an MPS call/session.
\- When the MRFC marks a Context with Priority information, the MRFP may use
the Priority information for selecting resources for the media and signaling
transport with priority. The following actions may be taken by the MRFP if it
has reached a congested state:
i) seize priority reserved resources; or
ii) if resources are completely congested, indicate that in a Command Response
error code.
NOTE 2: The Priority information can be used to derive Layer 2 QoS marking and
trigger priority identification and priority treatment for other QoS
technologies than Diffserv.
## 5.17 Coordination of Video Orientation
The MRFC and the MRFP may support the Coordination of Video Orientation (CVO)
as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23].
Upon receipt of an SDP offer containing the RTP header extension attribute(s)
\"a=extmap\" as defined in IETF RFC 5285 [27] and if the \"a=extmap\"
attribute indicates the CVO URN(s) (i.e. the CVO URN for a 2 bit granularity
of rotation and/or the CVO URN for a higher granularity of rotation) as
defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23], then:
a) if the MRFC and the MRFP support the CVO feature, the MRFC shall:
\- include an \"extended RTP header for CVO\" information element when seizing
resources in the MRFP to indicate the MRFP that it shall allow the RTP header
extension for CVO to pass; and
\- select exactly one of the CVO related \"a=extmap\" attribute from the SDP
offer and include the \"a=extmap\" attribute indicating selected CVO URN in
the SDP answer that will be sent within the SIP signalling; or
b) if the MRFP does not support the CVO feature the MRFC shall send the SDP
answer without any CVO related \"a=extmap\" attribute within the SIP
signalling.
NOTE 1: The UE supporting the CVO feature will not send the extended RTP
headers for CVO if the UE did not receive any SDP answer with the CVO related
\"a=extmap\" attribute.
When the MRFC selects one of the CVO related \"a=extmap\" attribute(s) from
the SDP offer the MRFC shall take into consideration which CVO variant it has
negotiated for CVO for other call leg(s) in the session.
If the MRFC and MRFP support the CVO feature then before sending an SDP offer,
the MRFC shall:
a) determine based on the local policy and the CVO negotiation results on
other call legs if, and with which granularity to offer CVO; and
b) if the MRFC determines to offer CVO:
\- the MRFC shall include the \"extended RTP header for CVO\" information
element when seizing resources in the MRFP to indicate the MRFP that it shall
allow the RTP header extension for CVO to pass; and
\- the MRFC shall include the CVO related \"a=extmap\" attribute in the SDP
offer it sends within the SIP signalling.
If the MRFP does not support the CVO feature, the MRFC shall send the SDP
offer without any CVO related \"a=extmap\" attribute within the SIP
signalling.
NOTE 2: The UE supporting the CVO feature will not send the extended RTP
headers for CVO if the UE did not receive any SDP offer with the CVO related
\"a=extmap\" attribute.
If the MRFP supports the CVO feature and has been instructed to pass on the
extended RTP header for CVO as described above then:
\- if the MRFP does not apply video transcoding, it shall pass any received
RTP CVO header extension to succeeding RTP streams; or
\- if the MRFP applies video transcoding, it shall keep the video orientation
unchanged during the transcoding and copy the received RTP CVO header
extension into the succeeding RTP streams after transcoding the associated
group of packets.
NOTE 3: IETF RFC 5285 [27] provides a framework for header extensions and can
also be used for non-CVO related purposes. It is an implementation decision of
the MRFP if it only passes CVO related RTP header extensions, or if it passes
any RTP header extension when being instructed with the \"extended RTP header
for CVO\" information element.
NOTE 4: The behaviour of the MRFP when being instructed with \"an extended RTP
header for CVO\" information element may be variable due to the settings on
the incoming and outgoing directions as listed in the table 5.17.1 and left
further for implementation decision.
NOTE 5: Unknown IETF RFC 5285 [27] RTP header extensions are ignored by the
destination RTP end system.
NOTE 6: In the conference scenarios when the picture mixing is needed, the
MRFP can perform the video rotation of picture elements according to the
received RTP CVO header extension for the associated pictures to achieve a
consistent orientation for all of the components in the mixture collage.
Table 5.17.1: MRFP behaviour with different settings of \"extended RTP header
for CVO\" information element in a particular direction
Connection Point A in incoming direction Connection Point B in outgoing
direction MRFP behaviour on CVO processing
* * *
With CVO With CVO Received RTP CVO header extension is forwarded to the
outgoing direction. With CVO No CVO Received RTP CVO header extension is
forwarded to the outgoing direction. No CVO With CVO No RTP CVO header
extension is forwarded since the source video does not contain any CVO
information.
## 5.18 Generic image attributes
The MRFC and the MRFP may support the generic image attributes to negotiate
the image size for sending and receiving video as required by 3GPP TS 26.114
[23].
If the MRFP and the MRFC support the negotiation of the image size and the
MRFC receives an SDP offer with the media-level SDP image attribute(s)
\"a=imageattr\", as defined in IETF RFC 6236 [28], and if the received image
sizes are supported by the MRFP then the MRFC shall:
\- include the generic image attribute parameters for the send and receive
directions when seizing or modifying resources in the MRFP; and
\- include the SDP image attribute \"a=imageattr\" indicating the supported
image sizes in the SDP answer on the Mr interface.
NOTE 1: The image attribute may be used within the SDP capability negotiation
framework and its use is then specified using the \"a=acap\" parameter.
NOTE 2: The MRFC not supporting the negotiation of the image size will ignore
received generic image attributes and will return the SDP answer without any
associated generic image attribute.
When sending the SDP body with image attribute(s) on the Mr interface the MRFC
shall include in the \"a=imageattr\":
\- \"recv\" keyword and corresponding image sizes which the MRFP supports in
the receiving direction; and
\- \"send\" keyword and corresponding image sizes which the MRFP supports in
the sending direction.
If the MRFP and the MRFC support the negotiation of the image size and the
MRFC sends an SDP offer for subsequent call leg in a conference, the MRFC
should include the SDP image attribute(s) \"a=imageattr\", with image sizes as
supported by the MRFP and negotiated at other call legs in the session.
If the MRFC receives an SDP answer containing the SDP image attribute
\"a=imageattr\", it shall modify resources in the MRFP if needed by indicating
the supported image sizes within the generic image attribute parameter.
If the MRFC supports the negotiation of the image size and if the MRFC sends
on the Mr interface the SDP body (offer or answer) it shall adjust the image
sizes to be the same for the call legs in the session.
If the MRFP does not support the negotiation of the image size the MRFC shall
send on the Mr interface the SDP body (offer or answer) without any image
attribute \"a=imageattr\".
If the MRFP is configured with different image sizes on the receive direction
of one termination and the send direction of another interconnected
termination, then it shall adjust the frame sizes accordingly when forwarding
video media streams and use the image size as described in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]
when sending media.
NOTE 3: The relation between the negotiated image sizes and CVO are specified
in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23].
NOTE 4: The generic image attribute includes information related to the send
and receive capabilities of a single termination, and the adjustment of image
sizes is typically based on the setting of two connected terminations in a
single context.
## 5.19 Interactive Connectivity Establishment support
### 5.19.1 General
The MRFC and the MRFP may support Interactive Connectivity Establishment
defined in IETF RFC 5245 [29] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [30] for NAT traversal as
required by 3GPP TS 23.228 [1]. The present clause describes the requirements
for MRFC and MRFP when the ICE procedures are supported.
Support of full ICE functionality is optional, but if ICE is supported, the
MRFC and MRFP shall at least support ICE lite as specified in IETF RFC 5245
[29]_._
The MRFC and MRFP shall only use host candidates as local ICE candidates.
NOTE: MRFC and MRFP are not located behind a NAT from perspective of the ICE
deployment model according to Figure 1 in IETF RFC 5245 [29].
If ICE is supported, the MRFC shall perform separate ICE negotiation and
procedures independentantly on each call leg (e.g. with each conference
participant). Furthermore, the MRFC may be configured to apply ICE procedures
only towards the access network side.
When the MRFC detects no ICE parameters in the received SDP, it shall not
configure the MRFP to apply any ICE and STUN related procedures toward the
call leg from where the SDP has been received.
Any MRFC supporting ICE shall advertise its support of incoming STUN
continuity check procedures. An MRFC supporting full ICE procedures shall in
addition advertise its support for originating STUN connectivity check
procedures.
If the MRFP does not indicate the support of STUN procedures, or if the MRFC
is configured not to apply ICE toward a call leg, the MRFC shall not configure
the MRFP to apply STUN procedures.
### 5.19.2 ICE lite
If the MRFC is configured to use ICE lite, or supports only ICE lite, or
controls an MRFP that only support ICE lite, the procedures in the present
clause apply.
If the MRFC receives an initial SDP offer with ICE candidate information but
no \"a=ice-lite\" attribute, the MRFC:
\- shall request the MRFP for each media line where it decides to use ICE to
reserve an ICE host candidate and provide its address information and a
related ICE user name fragment and password;
NOTE 1: Requesting only one host candidate per m-line prevents that the MRFC
will receive \"a=remote-candidates\" SDP attributes in a subsequent SDP.
Requesting separate ufrag and password for each media line simplifies H.248
encoding.
\- shall configure the MRFP to act as STUN server at the host candidate
address, i.e. to answer STUN connectivity checks;
\- may provide received remote ICE candidates and the received related ICE
user name fragment and password to the MRFP;
\- shall include the host candidate and related ICE user name fragment and
password received from the MRFP in the SDP answer and;
\- shall include the \"a=ice-lite\" attribute in the SDP answer.
If the MRFC receives SDP offer with ICE candidate information and an \"a=ice-
lite\" attribute, the MRFC shall not apply ICE towards that call leg and not
include any ICE related SDP attributes in the SDP answer.
NOTE 2: This avoids that the ICE lite peer needs to send extra SDP offers to
complete ICE procedures.
If the MRFC sends an SDP offer towards a call leg where ICE is to be applied,
the MRFC:
\- shall request the MRFP to reserve a host candidate for each media line
where it decides to use ICE and provide its address information, user name
fragment and password;
\- shall configure the MRFP to act as STUN server at the host candidate
address, i.e. to answer STUN connectivity checks;
\- shall include the host candidate provided by the MRFP and related ICE user
name fragment and password in the SDP offer; and
\- shall include the \"a=ice-lite\" attribute in the SDP offer.
If the MRFC then receives an SDP answer with candidate information from the
call leg where ICE is to be applied, the MRFC may provide received remote ICE
candidates and the received related ICE user name fragment and password to the
MRFP.
After the initial SDP offer-answer exchange, the MRFC can receive a new offer
from the peer that includes updated address and port information in the SDP
\"c=\" line, \"m=\" line, or \"a=rtcp\" line SDP attributes. If the ICE user
name fragment and password in the SDP offer differ from the ones received in
the previous SDP (i.e. the peer restarts ICE), the MRFC shall apply the same
procedures as for the initial SDP offer.
When receiving a request for a host candidate for a media line, the MRFP shall
allocate one host candidate for that media line and send it to the MRFC within
the reply. The IP address and port shall be the same as indicated separately
as Local IP Resources. The MRFP shall also indicate that it supports ICE lite
in the reply.
When receiving a request for an ICE user name fragment and password, the MRFP
shall generate an ICE user name fragment and password and send it to the MRFC
within the reply. The MRFP shall store the password and user name fragment to
be able to authenticate incoming STUN binding request according to clause 7.2
of IETF RFC 5245 [29].
When receiving a request to act as STUN server, the MRFP shall be prepared to
answer STUN binding request according to clause 7.2 of IETF RFC 5245 [29].
Once a STUN binding request with the \"USE-CANDIDATE\" flag has been received,
the MRFP may send media towards the source of the binding request.
### 5.19.3 Full ICE
If the MRFC supports and is configured to use full ICE, and controls an MRFP
that supports full ICE, the procedures in the present clause apply.
If the MRFC receives an initial SDP offer with ICE candidate information, the
MRFC:
\- shall request the MRFP for each media line where it decides to use ICE to
reserve an ICE host candidate and provide its address information and a
related ICE user name fragment and password;
NOTE: Requesting only one host candidate per m-line prevents that the MRFC
will receive \"a=remote-candidates\" SDP attributes in a subsequent SDP.
Requesting separate ufrag and password for each media line simplifies H.248
encoding.
\- shall configure the MRFP to act as STUN server at the host candidate
address, i.e. to answer STUN connectivity checks;
\- shall provide received remote ICE candidates and the received related ICE
user name fragment and password to the MRFP;
\- shall include the host candidate and related ICE user name fragment and
password received from the MRFP in the SDP answer;
\- shall determine the role of the MRFC in ICE (controlling or controlled)
according to clause 5.2 of IETF RFC 5245 [29];
\- shall configure the MRFP to perform connectivity checks in accordance with
the determined ICE role;
\- shall configure the MRFP to report connectivity check results; and
\- shall configure the MRFP to report a new peer reflexive candidate if
discovered during the connectivity check.
If the MRFC sends an SDP offer towards a call leg where ICE is to be applied,
the MRFC:
\- shall request the MRFP to reserve a host candidate for each media line were
it decides to use ICE and provide its address information, ICE user name
fragment and password;
\- shall configure the MRFP to act as STUN server at the host candidate
address, i.e. to answer STUN connectivity checks; and
\- shall include the host candidate provided by the MRFP and related ICE user
name fragment and password in the SDP offer.
If the MRFC then receives an SDP answer with candidate information from the
call leg where ICE is to be applied, the MRFC:
\- shall provide received remote ICE candidates and the received related ICE
user name fragment and password to the MRFP;
\- shall determine the role of the MRFC in ICE (controlling or controlled)
according to clause 5.2 of RFC 5245 [29];
\- shall configure the MRFP to perform connectivity checks in accordance with
the determined ICE role;
\- shall configure the MRFP to report connectivity check results; and
\- shall configure the MRFP to report a new peer reflexive candidate if
discovered during the connectivity check.
When the MRFC is informed by the MRFP about new peer reflexive candidate(s)
discovered by the connectivity checks, it shall configure the MRFP to perform
additional connectivity checks for those candidates,
When the MRFC is informed by the MRFP about successful candidate pairs
determined by the connectivity checks, the MRFC shall send a new SDP offer to
its peer with contents according to clause 9.2.2.2 of IETF RFC 5245 [29] if it
has the controlling role and the highest-priority candidate pair differs from
the default candidates in previous SDP.
After the initial SDP offer-answer exchange, the MRFC can receive a new offer
from the peer that includes updated address and port information in the SDP
\"c=\" line, \"m=\" line, or \"a=rtcp\" line SDP attributes. If the ICE user
name fragment and password in the SDP offer differ from the ones received in
the previous SDP (i.e. the peer restarts ICE), the MRFC shall apply the same
procedures as for the initial SDP offer.
When receiving a request for a host candidate for a media line, the MRFP shall
allocate one host candidate for that media line and send it to the MRFC within
the reply. The IP address and port shall be the same as indicated separately
as Local IP Resources.
When receiving a request for an ICE user name fragment and password, the MRFP
shall generate an ICE user name fragment and password and send it to the MRFC
within the reply. The MRFP shall store the password and user name fragment to
be able to authenticate incoming STUN binding request according to clause 7.2
of IETF RFC 5245 [29].
When receiving a request to act as STUN server, the MRFP shall be prepared to
answer STUN binding request according to clause 7.2 of IETF RFC 5245 [29].
Once a STUN binding request with the \"USE-CANDIDATE\" flag has been received,
the MRFP may send media towards the source of the binding request.
When receiving a request to perform connectivity checks and to report
connectivity check results, the IMS AGW:
\- shall compute ICE candidate pairs according to clause 5.7 of IETF RFC 5245
[29];
\- shall schedule checks for the ICE candidate pairs according to clause 5.8
of IETF RFC 5245 [29];
\- shall send STUN connectivity checks for the scheduled checks according to
clause 7.1 of IETF RFC 5245 [29];
\- shall inform the MRFC about successful candidate pairs determined by the
connectivity checks;
\- shall inform the MRFC about new peer reflexive candidate(s) discovered by
the connectivity checks; and
\- should send media using the highest priority candidate pair for which
connectivity checks have been completed.
The MRFC and the MRFP shall check the conformance of the selected candidate
pair with the media address information in SDP.
## 5.20 IMS Media Plane Security
### 5.20.1 General
The MRFC and the MRFP may support IMS media plane security as specified in
3GPP TS 33.328 [31]. They may support end-to-end security (e2e) for a TCP (see
IETF RFC 793 [38]) based media using TLS and the Key Management Service (KMS).
The e2e media security of TCP is based on the session keys negotiated via the
TLS handshake protocol between the served UE and the MRFP as specified in 3GPP
TS 33.328 [31].
E2e security for TCP based media using TLS and KMS is applicable for MSRP (see
IETF RFC 4975 [18]; used in IMS session-based messaging conference) and BFCP
(see IETF RFC 4582 [20]; used in IMS conferencing). The MRFC and the MRFP may
support e2e security for MSRP, BFCP, or both protocols.
E2e protection of the MSRP and BFCP sessions is achieved through the KMS and a
\"ticket\" concept:
\- The session initiator requests keys and a ticket from the KMS. The ticket
contains the keys in a protected format. The initiator then sends the ticket
to the recipient.
\- The recipient presents the ticket to the KMS and the KMS returns the keys
on which the media security shall be based.
### 5.20.2 End-to-end security for TCP-based media using TLS
The e2e protection of the TCP based media relies on the usage of TLS (see IETF
RFC 5246 [32]), according to the TLS profile specified in Annex E of 3GPP TS
33.310 [47] and Annex M of 3GPP TS 33.328 [31].
The end-to-end security protection of session based messaging (MSRP) and
conferencing (BFCP) is based on the pre-shared key ciphersuites for TLS
(specified in IETF RFC 4279 [34] and with the profile defined in Annex H of
3GPP TS 33.328 [31]) and the MIKEY-TICKET mechanism (specified in IETF RFC
6043 [33] with the profiling of the tickets and procedures given in 3GPP TS
33.328 [31].
The Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is the Traffic-Encrypting Key (TEK) associated with
the Crypto Session (CS) that shall be used in the TLS handshake.
NOTE 1: The Security Parameters Index (SPI) in the CS points to a TEK
Generation Key (TGK) that is used to derive the TEK for the crypto session
using the CS ID (and some other parameters). The SPI could also point to a TEK
directly.
If the MRFC and the MRFP support and are configured to use the e2e protection
of the TCP based media using the pre-shared key ciphersuites for TLS and the
MIKEY-TICKET mechanism, the following functional requirements apply.
The list of pre-shared key ciphersuites for TLS supported by the MRFP shall be
preconfigured in the MRFC.
According to the TLS profile specified in Annex E of 3GPP TS 33.310 [47], the
MRFP shall accept TLS renegotiation only if it is secured according to IETF
RFC 5746 [46].
NOTE 2: IETF RFC 5746 [46] defines a \"TLS secure renegotiation\" procedure,
which leaves the definition of a basic TLS renegotiation still open. H.248
based support to enable the MRFC to allow or not allow the MRFP to perform
client initiated or server initiated TLS renegotiation is not addressed in the
present release. The behaviour of the MRFP for \"TLS session renegotiation\"
procedure is hence not further defined in the present release.
The MRFC acting as the session initiator shall:
\- prepare the media security offer in the SDP body of the SIP INVITE request;
\- include a single crypto session of type TLS in the TRANSFER_INIT message
according to procedures specified in 3GPP TS 33.328 [31]; and
NOTE 3: Depending on the KMS and a local policy, the MRFC will either interact
with the KMS to obtain keys and the MIKEY-TICKET ticket usable for the served
UE or will create the ticket by itself. In the latter case, MIKEY-TICKET mode
3 as specified in IETF RFC 6043 [33] is used, and the MRFC will then perform
all key and ticket generation functions otherwise performed by the KMS.
\- insert in the SDP offer the SDP key management protocol attribute \"a=key-
mgmt\" specified in IETF RFC 4567 [35] which indicates use of the MIKEY-TICKET
ticket and contains the TRANSFER_INIT message.
Upon receipt of the SIP response with the SDP answer the MRFC shall check that
the responder is authorized before completing the media security setup. If the
MRFC notices that the other endpoint is not as expected, the MRFC shall abort
the session setup. Otherwise the MRFC shall derive the PSK and shall send it
to the MRFP.
Upon receipt of the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer containing the media
security offer and the SDP key management protocol attribute \"a=key-mgmt\"
specified in IETF RFC 4567 [35] which indicates use of the MIKEY-TICKET ticket
and contains the TRANSFER_INIT message the MRFC shall:
\- check if it is authorized to resolve the ticket and if that is the case the
MRFC interacts with the KMS to resolve the ticket and receive keys;
\- include the MIKEY-TICKET response in the generated TRANSFER_RESP message;
\- insert in the SDP answer the SDP key management protocol attribute \"a=key-
mgmt\" specified in IETF RFC 4567 [35] which indicates use of the MIKEY-TICKET
ticket and contains the TRANSFER_RESP message; and
\- shall derive the PSK and shall send it to the MRFP.
The MRFC acting as the session initiator or the session responder shall:
\- determine via SDP negotiation as specified in IETF RFC 4145 [36] if the
MRFP needs to act as TCP client or server;
\- request the MRFP to start the TCP connection establishment if the MRFP
needs to act as TCP client;
\- determine via SDP negotiation if the MRFP needs to act as TLS client or
server as specified in the clauses below;
NOTE 4: The determination of the TLS client/server role relies on different
rules for MSRP and BFCP.
\- if the MRFP needs to act as TLS client, request the MRFP to start the TLS
session setup once the TCP connection is established towards the served UE;
and
\- apply additional specific procedures specified for the MSRP in clause
5.20.3 or for the BFCP in clause 5.20.4.
The MRFP shall:
\- upon request from the MRFC, start a TCP connection establishment by sending
a TCP SYN;
\- release the underlying TCP bearer connection as soon as the TLS session is
released;
\- be capable to support both the TLS server and TLS client roles;
\- when being instructed to start the TLS session setup, act as a TLS client
and establish the TLS session as soon as the underlying TCP bearer connection
is established;
\- uniquely associate the PSK received from the MRFC with the corresponding
TCP based media stream;
\- use the received PSK in the TLS handshake; and
\- apply additional specific procedures specified for the MSRP in clause
5.20.3 or for the BFCP in clause 5.20.4.
### 5.20.3 Specific requirements for session based messaging (MSRP)
For the each MSRP media stream requiring e2e security, the MRFC shall:
a) indicate \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" as transport protocol when requesting resources
from the MRFP; and
b) determine via SDP negotiation if the MRFP needs to act as TLS client or TLS
server as specified in IETF RFC 8122 [39] using the IETF RFC 4145 [36]
\"a=setup\" SDP attribute as follows:
\- if the MRFC sends the \"a=setup:active\" SDP attribute in the SDP answer
towards the UE, the MRFP shall act as TLS client;
\- if the MRFC sends the \"a=setup:passive\" SDP attribute in the SDP answer
towards the UE, the MRFP shall act as TLS server;
\- if the MRFC receives the \"a=setup:active\" SDP attribute in the SDP answer
from the UE, the MRFP shall act as TLS server; and
\- if the MRFC receives the \"a=setup:passive\" SDP attribute in the SDP
answer from the UE, the MRFP shall act as TLS client.
NOTE: Since the \"a=setup:\" SDP attribute is used for the negotiation of the
client/server roles for both protocols, TCP and TLS, then the assignment of a
particular endpoint role (client or server) also applies for both protocols
(e.g. the TLS server role assignment means also the TCP server role
assignment).
The MRFP shall send the TLS protected MSRP packets to the served UE and shall
accept the TLS protected MSRP packets from the served UE as requested by the
MRFC.
### 5.20.4 Specific requirements for conferencing (BFCP)
For the each BFCP media stream requiring e2e security, the MRFC shall:
a) indicate \"TCP/TLS/BFCP\" as transport protocol when requesting resources
from the MRFP; and
b) determine via SDP negotiation (see IETF RFC 4583 [21]) if the MRFP needs to
act as TLS client or TLS server as follows:
\- if the MRFC receives an initial SDP offer from the served UE, the MRFP
shall act as TLS server; or
\- if the MRFC sends an initial SDP offer towards the served UE, the MRFP
shall act as TLS client.
The MRFP shall send the TLS protected BFCP packets to the served UE and shall
accept the TLS protected BFCP packets from the served UE as requested by the
MRFC.
## 5.21 TCP bearer connection control
If an MRFC and an MRFP support TCP as transport protocol (see IETF RFC 793
[38] and IETF RFC 4145 [36]), the following functional requirements apply.
NOTE 1: Support of TCP is required if the MRFC and the MRFP support the
session based messaging (MSRP), (see IETF RFC 4975 [18]), and the conferencing
using the floor control service (BFCP), (see IETF RFC 4582 [20]).
NOTE 2: It is assumed that these requirements also apply to pre-Release 12
MRFCs and MRFPs.
Upon reception of an SDP offer or an SDP answer containing a media line for a
new TCP based media stream, the MRFC shall for that TCP based media stream:
\- determine via SDP negotiation if the MRFP needs to act as TCP client or TCP
server using the IETF RFC 4145 [36] \"a=setup\" SDP attribute as follows:
a) if the MRFC sends the \"a=setup:active\" SDP attribute in the SDP answer
towards the conference participant, the MRFP shall act as TCP client;
b) if the MRFC sends the \"a=setup:passive\" SDP attribute in the SDP answer
towards the conference participant, the MRFP shall act as TCP server;
c) if the MRFC receives the \"a=setup:active\" SDP attribute in the SDP answer
from the conference participant, the MRFP shall act as TCP server; and
d) if the MRFC receives the \"a=setup:passive\" SDP attribute in the SDP
answer from the conference participant, the MRFP shall act as TCP client;
\- if no media security is applied, indicate \"TCP/MSRP\" (for session based
messaging) or \"TCP/BFCP\" (for conferencing) as transport protocol to the
MRFP;
\- if media security is applied, indicate the transport protocol according to
clause 5.20 to the MRFP;
\- request the MRFP to allocate a TCP port at the termination towards the SDP
offerer/answerer;
\- indicate TCP port number from the received SDP offer/answer in the remote
descriptor at the termination towards the SDP offerer/answerer;
\- request the MRFP to start a TCP connection establishment if the MRFP needs
to act as TCP client; and
\- request the MRFP to report TCP connection establishment related failures.
Upon request from the MRFC to reserve and/or configure resources for TCP based
media the MRFP shall:
\- if being instructed to start TCP connection establishment at a given
termination, start TCP connection establishment at that TCP termination by
sending a TCP SYN message;
\- if not being instructed to start TCP connection establishment at a given
termination, answer any received TCP SYN message at a given termination with
appropriate messages according to TCP procedures; and
NOTE 3: The MRFP will use the source IP address and TCP port of the received
TCP SYN message as a destination address for the TCP SYN ACK message.
\- report TCP connection establishment related failures to the MRFC.
## 5.22 Support of Telepresence
### 5.22.1 General
If the MRFC and the MRFP support telepresence, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.103
[52] and if the CLUE data channel used for telepresence is terminated in the
MRFP, the following requirements and procedure apply.
### 5.22.2 Characteristics of the Telepresence support
The characteristics of the telepresence support by the MRFC and the MRFP are
the following:
1) Regarding usage of CLUE data channel with respect to H.248
context/termination/stream model:
a) there is only one single H.248 termination for the telepresence bearer
traffic of a single conference participant, which covers all telepresence
media traffic flows and CLUE for control purposes;
b) there is only one CLUE data channel per conference participant (i.e., per
H.248 termination);
c) the CLUE protocol including the underlying transport of a CLUE data
channel, SCTP association, DTLS and lower layer protocols are modelled by a
single H.248 stream; and
d) there is only one single CLUE data channel per SCTP association, hence a
single SCTP stream only;
2) Regarding the transport protocol stack:
a) the L4 protocol is always \"UDP\";
NOTE 1: Any switchover to or alternative usage of \"TCP\" (due to possible NAT
traversal issues) is out of scope. The option of DTLS-over-TCP is not
supported (despite the fact that the CLUE data channel is based on the
framework of WebRTC data channels).
3) For the protocol termination of SCTP in the MRFP:
a) the protocol parameter configuration for the SCTP is done via configuration
management or default value settings, apart from the information elements
(specified in clause 5.22.3) which are signalled between the MRFC and the MRFP
using the SDP for SCTP;
4) Regarding the establishment procedures for DTLS and SCTP:
a) the establishment of a SCTP association is tightly coupled to the
successful establishment of the underlying DTLS session/connection;
b) only an _immediate_ SCTP establishment is supported;
NOTE 2: Hence, an _explicit information_ element for triggering the sending of
an outgoing SCTP establishment request is not required.
c) the MRFP will immediately send an outgoing SCTP establishment request (SCTP
INIT) when DTLS layer connectivity is available, if the MRFP did not already
receive an incoming SCTP establishment request;
5) Regarding the procedure for closing the CLUE data channel:
NOTE 3: The closure procedure according to clause 3.2.7 of IETF RFC 8850 [49]
is not supported (because the correspondent \"SCTP reset message\" cannot be
explicitly triggered by the MRFC.
a) the MRFP will deny during the SCTP association establishment phase the
negotiation of SCTP extensions (such as the SCTP stream reset capability) in
order to prevent their later usage for a closure procedure; and
b) a CLUE data channel is released by a removal of the H.248 stream endpoint
or the subtraction of the H.248 termination, or a release procedure of the
DTLS bearer session. All these triggers lead firstly to a SCTP shutdown
procedure and then a subsequent DTLS bearer session release procedure;
6) security aspects:
a) incoming DTLS session/connection establishment request is not blocked; and
b) incoming SCTP association establishment request is not blocked.
### 5.22.3 CLUE data channel establishment
For establishing a CLUE data channel an SDP-based \"SCTP over DTLS\" data
channel negotiation mechanism is used. SDP offer/answer transactions between
the MRFC and the served TP UE are based on the SDP offer/answer procedure
specified in IETF RFC 8841 [48] and IETF RFC 8842 [65]. The SDP describing an
SCTP association over DTLS/UDP to be used to realize a CLUE data channel
contains:
\- \"m=\" line with \"UDP/DTLS/SCTP\" as transport protocol and UDP port;
\- associated pair of \"tls-id\" SDP attribute values (the attribute values of
the TP UE and the MRFC, see IETF RFC 8842 [65]);
\- associated \"sctp-port\" and optional \"max-message-size\" attributes (see
IETF RFC 8841 [48]); and
\- associated \"dcmap\" attribute (specified in IETF RFC 8864 [50]) with a
\"stream-id\" parameter set to a value of the used SCTP stream and a
subprotocol parameter set to \"CLUE\" as specified in IETF RFC 8850 [49].
For the media line with \"UDP/DTLS/SCTP\" as transport protocol to be set up
for a CLUE data channel, the MRFC:
\- shall send the remote UDP port and SCTP port to the MRFP;
\- shall request the local UDP port and SCTP port from the MRFP;
\- shall indicate the MRFP to start a DTLS bearer session establishment at the
termination towards the SDP offerer, if the received SDP offerer contains an
\"a=setup:passive\" SDP attribute;
\- shall send the dcmap-stream-id parameter that is contained in the received
SDP offer, indicating the actual SCTP stream identifier with the SCTP
association (over DTLS/UDP) used to realize the CLUE data channel;
\- shall send the subprotocol value of \"CLUE\", indicating the protocol to be
exchanged via the data channel;
\- if the max-message-size parameter is contained in the received SDP offer,
may forward the received max-message-size parameter, indicating to the MRFP
the maximum message size the served TP UE is willing to accept;
\- may request the maximum message size the MRFP is willing to accept;
\- shall send the received TP UE certificate fingerprint to the MRFP that is
then able to correlate the fingerprint within the CLUE data channel uniquely;
and
\- shall request the certificate fingerprint from the MRFP, for the \"m=\"
line to be transported between the served TP UE and the MRFP using CLUE data
channel.
For the media line with \"UDP/DTLS/SCTP\" as transport protocol to be set up
for a CLUE data channel, the MRFP shall:
\- allocate the local UDP port and SCTP port, and send them to the MRFC;
\- when being instructed to start the DTLS bearer session setup, act as a DTLS
client and establish the DTLS bearer session;
\- if it is requested from the MRFC, set the maximum message size that is
acceptable for the CLUE data channel and send it to the MRFC;
\- upon request from the MRFC, select an own certificate for the CLUE data
channel, and send the fingerprint of the own certificate to the MRFC;
\- uniquely associate the certificate fingerprint received from the MRFC with
the corresponding CLUE data channel, and subsequently use the certificate
fingerprint to verify the establishment of the DTLS bearer session;
\- if the verification of the remote certificate fingerprint during the DTLS
bearer session establishment fails, regard the remote DTLS endpoint as not
authenticated, terminate the DTLS bearer session and report the unsuccessful
DTLS bearer session setup to the MRFC; and
\- indicate the support of the required SCTP extensions (i.e. RE-CONFIG) and
other SCTP considerations as defined in clause 3.2 of IETF RFC 8850 [49] at
the start of the SCTP association.
### 5.22.4 Release of CLUE data channel
To close the CLUE data channel, the MRFC may instruct the MRFP to release the
underlying communication (i.e., protocol stack UDP/DTLS/SCTP) for the CLUE
data channel, which may result in triggering the release of the DTLS bearer
session (which then will implicitly lead to a SCTP association shutdown
procedure).
Regarding the SCTP reset, the MRFP shall provide a pre-configured (i.e.,
autonomous) behaviour by preventing \"SCTP Stream Reconfiguration\" procedures
as specified in IETF RFC 6525[51], which results in:
1) for an outgoing direction: the MRFP shall not initiate any \"Sender-Side
Procedures for the RE-CONFIG Chunk\", as specified in IETF RFC 6525[51]; and
2) for an incoming direction: the MRFP shall deny any SCTP re-configuration
request (as part of \"Receiver-Side Procedures for the RE-CONFIG Chunk\", as
specified in IETF RFC 6525[51]) in order to prevent possible later usage of
SCTP stream reset requests.
### 5.22.5 CLUE transport between MRFC and MRFP
When the data channel is terminated in the MRFP for telepresence, CLUE
messages (e.g. OPTIONS, ADVERTISEMENT, CONFIGURE etc.) are sent from the MRFC
to the MRFP to be exchanged via the CLUE data channel between the MRFP and the
TP UE.
When the MRFC requests the MRFP to establish a CLUE data channel the MRFC
shall include a Notify CLUE Message Received Event information element to
request the MRFP a reporting of the received CLUE message.
When a CLUE message needs to be sent to the TP UE the MRFC shall request the
MRFP to send the CLUE message.
Upon reception of the request to send CLUE message from the MRFC containing
the CLUE message content the MRFP shall send the CLUE message to the TP UE.
When a CLUE message is received from the TP UE, the MRFP shall send the
content of the received CLUE message to the MRFC.
5.23 SDP Capability Negotiation (SDPCapNeg)
The SDP Capability Negotiation (SDPCapNeg) as specified in IETF RFC 5939 [53]
is adopted as an optional functionality to negotiate capabilities and their
associated configurations according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [30].
Upon receipt of an incoming SDP offer containing the attributes of SDP
capability negotiation, e.g. offer AVPF and AVP together for the RTP profile
negotiation using \"a=tcap\", \"a=pcfg\" and \"a=acfg\" attributes, the MRFC
acting as the session responder shall make the decision on support of the
alternative configurations based on the MRFC/MRFP capability as provision, and
request the MRFP to reserve resources only for the configuration as selected.
The MRFC then send the SDP answer indicating the selected configuration in the
\"a=acfg\" attribute for actual configurations.
The MRFC acting as the session initiator may signal SDPCapNeg to the MRFP,
e.g. the MRFC wildcards the supporting configurations from the MRFP in order
to construct an SDP offer with the alternative configurations via SDPCapNeg
attributes.
> NOTE: The additional benefit of signalling SDPCapNeg between the MRFC and
> the MRFP is to check the resource availability for the corresponding
> configurations and to avoid the further session failure in case of
> inadequate resources for the configuration changes in the final
> confirmation. However, due to the extra resources reserved only during the
> call establishment phase, there is increased risk of call establishment
> failure.
In case the MRFC decides to request the MRFP to reserve resources for all of
those configurations, the MRFC shall:
> \- use legacy SDP attributes as specified in IETF RFC 4566 [53] to do the
> mapping of actual and potential configurations with the H.248 ReserveGroup
> concept; or
>
> \- use SDP extensions for SDP capability negotiation as specified in IETF
> RFC 5939 [53], if supported by the MRFP.
Before using SDP extensions for SDP capability negotiation as specified in
IETF RFC 5939 [53] towards the MRFP, the MRFC shall perform the necessary
checks (i.e. through auditing or via prior provisioning) to ensure that the
MRFP supports the syntax and capabilities requested. For an auditing the
procedure in clause 6.1.8.1 is used with the \"SDPCapNeg Supported
Capabilities\" as the object.
When receiving a request from the MRFC with information element \"SDPCapNeg
configuration\" indicating the potential use of multiple configurations, the
MRFP shall reserve resources for all of those configurations that it supports
and shall send indicate the configurations for which it reserved resources in
an \"SDPCapNeg configuration\" information element in the response. The MRFC
shall update the SDP offer with SDPCapNeg configurations in the response from
the MRFP and shall forward the SDP offer to the next hop.
On receipt of an SDP answer with SDPCapNeg, the MRFC shall request the MRFP to
configure the resources for the selected configuration. If the MRFP previously
reserved any temporary resources for configurations that were not selected,
the MRFC shall also request the MRFP to release those resources.
## 5.24 Video Region-of-Interest (ROI)
### 5.24.1 General
The MRFC and the MRFP may support the video Region-of-Interest (ROI) as
defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]. Three modes are specified for supporting ROI,
including \"Far End Camera Control (FECC)\", \"Arbitrary ROI\" and
\"Predefined ROI\". The MRFC and the MRFP may independently support any of
these modes.
For the forthcoming clauses on \"Far End Camera Control (FECC)\", \"Arbitrary
ROI\" and \"Predefined ROI\", the MRF procedures allow for only a single ROI-
sending client in a given conference to receive and act on ROI requests for a
given ROI mode, but they allow for multiple ROI-receiving clients to issue and
send ROI requests. Once the MRFC successfully completes the ROI capability
negotiation with the ROI-sending client, it offers the corresponding ROI
capabilities to other ROI-receiving clients in the conference and instructs
the MRFP to signal ROI request(s) to the ROI-sending client based on the ROI
requests it receives from the ROI-receiving clients.
### 5.24.2 \"Far End Camera Control\" mode
The MRFC and MRFP may support the \"Far End Camera Control\" mode as specified
in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]. If the MRFC and MRFP support the \"Far End Camera
Control\" mode, the MRFC and MRFP shall apply the procedures in the present
clause.
Upon receipt of an SDP offer containing an \"m=\" line with a media type
\"application/h224\", as defined by IETF RFC 4573 [54] which indicates support
for FECC (ITU-T Recommendation H.281 [56]) using ITU-T Recommendation H.224
[55], the MRFC shall determine based on the local policy and the ROI
negotiation results on other call legs whether to accept this \"FECC\" offer.
If the \"FECC\" offer is accepted, the MRFC shall:
\- include the \"m=\" and \"a=\" lines related to the \"application/h224\"
media types (see the related SDP examples in annex A.4.2e of 3GPP TS 26.114
[23]) in the SDP answer that will be sent within the SIP signalling;
\- request the MRFP to provide a separate IP/UDP/RTP transport for the
\"application/h224\" media stream by setting the \"m=\" line media type to
\"application\" and \"RTP/AVP\" or \"RTP/AVPF\" over UDP as transport protocol
when reserving the transport resources, and forward transparently RTP/UDP
packets (with the transparent (H.224)-PDU); and
\- only one of the SDP offers containing \"a=sendrecv\" or \"a=recvonly\"
capabilities shall be responded by the MRFC with an SDP answer with an
indication of \"a=sendonly\" and other such SDP offers, if accepted, shall be
responded by the MRFC with an SDP answer with an indication of \"a=recvonly\".
\- request the MRFP to pass RTP flows from the terminations where the MRFC
replied with \"a=recvonly\" in the SDP answer to the termination where the
MRFC replied with \"a=sendonly\" in the SDP answer.
NOTE 1: There may be one media type \"application/h224\" \"m=\" line for each
video \"m=\" line.
NOTE 2: The use of FECC itself is internal to the H.224 frame and is
identified by the client ID field of the H.224 packet. The MRFC only indicates
the use of IP/UDP/RTP. The use of FECC is signalled via H.224 by a MTSI
client.
If the MRFP does not support the FECC feature or the MRFC determines that the
\"FECC\" offer should not be accepted based on the local policy and the ROI
negotiation results on other call legs, the MRFC shall send the SDP answer
without any \"m=\" and \"a=\" lines related to the \"application/h224\" media
types within the SIP signalling.
If the MRFC and MRFP support the FECC feature then before sending an SDP
offer, the MRFC shall:
a) determine based on the local policy and the FECC negotiation results on
other call legs to offer FECC; and
b) if the MRFC determines to offer FECC:
\- the MRFC shall include the \"m=\" and \"a=\" lines related to the
\"application/h224\" media types in the SDP offer it sends within the SIP
signalling; and
\- request the MRFP to provide a separate IP/UDP/RTP transport for the
\"application/h224\" media stream by setting the \"m=\" line media type to
\"application\" and \"RTP/AVP\" or \"RTP/AVPF\" over UDP as transport protocol
when reserving the transport resources, and forward transparently RTP/UDP
packets (with the transparent (H.224)-PDU)
> \- only one of the SDP offers from the MRFC shall contain \"a=sendonly\" and
> remaining SDP offers from the MRFC shall contain \"a=recvonly\".
>
> \- request the MRFP to pass RTP flows from the terminations where the MRFC
> indicated with \"a=recvonly\" in the SDP offer to the termination where the
> MRFC indicated with \"a=sendonly\" in the SDP offer.
If the MRFP does not support the FECC feature, the MRFC shall send the SDP
offer without any FECC related SDP attributes within the SIP signalling.
### 5.24.3 \"Predefined ROI\" mode
The MRFC and MRFP may support the \"Predefined ROI\" mode as specified in 3GPP
TS 26.114 [23]. If the MRFC and MRFP support the \"Predefined ROI\", the MRFC
and MRFP shall apply the procedures in the present clause.
Upon receipt of an SDP offer containing the predefined ROI attribute(s)
\"a=predefined_ROI\" defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23], the MRFC shall determine
based on the local policy and the ROI negotiation results on other call legs
whether to accept this \"Predefined ROI\" offer. If the \"Predefined ROI\"
offer is accepted, the MRFC shall include the accepted set of predefined ROIs
in the SDP answer by indicating them using the \"a=predefined_ROI\" attributes
that will be sent within the SIP signalling (see the related SDP examples in
annex A.4.2e of 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]). The accepted set of predefined ROIs
shall be based on the predefined ROIs offered by the client designated by the
MRFC as the ROI-sending client. For the response to the ROI-sending client,
the SDP answer from the MRFC shall not contain \"a=predefined_ROI\"
attributes. If the MRFP does not support the Predefined ROI feature or the
MRFC determines that the \"Predefined ROI\" offer should not be accepted based
on the local policy and the ROI negotiation results on other call legs, the
MRFC shall send the SDP answer without any \"a=predefined_ROI\" attributes
within the SIP signalling.
Upon receipt of an SDP offer containing an \"a=rtcp-fb\" line with the
\"Predefined ROI\" type expressed by the parameter \"3gpp-roi-predefined\", as
described in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23], the MRFC shall determine based on the local
policy and the ROI negotiation results on other call legs whether to accept
this \"Predefined ROI\" offer. If the \"Predefined ROI\" offer is accepted,
the MRFC shall:
\- at the termination towards the ROI-sending client, include the \"Predefined
ROI Sent\" information element when seizing resources in the MRFP to indicate
to the MRFP that it shall signal RTCP \"FB ROI\" feedback message(s) related
to predefined ROI on that termination and request the MRFP to assign the
related resources for the corresponding RTCP control flow to convey pre-
defined ROI information;
\- at a termination towards an ROI-receiving client, include the \"Predefined
ROI Received\" information element when seizing resources in the MRFP to
indicate to the MRFP that it shall accept RTCP \"FB ROI\" feedback message(s)
related to predefined ROI on that termination and request the MRFP to assign
the related resources for the corresponding RTCP control flow to convey pre-
defined ROI information; and
\- include \"a=rtcp-fb\" lines related to the \"3gpp-roi-predefined\"
parameter in the SDP answer that will be sent within the SIP signalling (see
the related SDP examples in annex A.4.2e of 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]); and
NOTE: The RTCP control flow contains multiple RTCP packet types.
If the MRFP does not support the Predefined ROI feature or the MRFC determines
that the \"Predefined ROI\" offer should not be accepted based on the local
policy and the ROI negotiation results on other call legs, the MRFC shall send
the SDP answer without any \"a=rtcp-fb\" lines related to the \"3gpp-roi-
predefined\" parameter within the SIP signalling.
Upon receipt of an SDP offer containing \"a=extmap\" attribute(s), as defined
in IETF RFC 5285 [27], and the \"a=extmap\" attribute(s) contain the pre-
defined ROI URN(s) (i.e. the ROI URN for carriage of pre-defined region of
interest information in the sent video stream is given by
\"urn:3gpp:predefined-roi-sent\") as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23], then the
MRFC shall determine based on the local policy and the ROI negotiation results
on other call legs whether to accept this \"Predefined ROI\" offer. If the
\"Predefined ROI\" offer is accepted, the MRFC shall:
\- include the \"Extended RTP header for Sent ROI\" information element when
seizing resources in the MRFP to indicate to the MRFP that it shall allow the
RTP header extension for predefined ROI to pass; and
\- include \"a=extmap\" attributes containing the pre-defined ROI URN in the
SDP answer that will be sent within the SIP signalling (see the related SDP
examples in annex A.4.2e of 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]).
If the MRFP does not support the Predefined ROI feature or the MRFC determines
that the \"Predefined ROI\" offer should not be accepted based on the local
policy and the ROI negotiation results on other call legs, the MRFC shall send
the SDP answer without any Predefined ROI related \"a=extmap\" attribute
within the SIP signalling.
If the MRFC and MRFP support the Predefined ROI feature then before sending an
SDP offer, the MRFC shall:
a) determine based on the local policy and the Predefined ROI negotiation
results on other call legs if, and with what configurations to offer
Predefined ROI; and
b) if the MRFC determines to offer Predefined ROI:
> \- at the termination towards the ROI sending client, the MRFC shall include
> the \"Predefined ROI Sent\" information element when seizing resources in
> the MRFP to indicate to the MRFP that it shall signal RTCP \"FB ROI\"

\- the MRFC shall include \"a=rtcp-fb\" lines related to the \"3gpp-roi-
predefined\" parameter along with the associated \"a=predefined_ROI\"
attributes in the SDP offer it sends within the SIP signalling;
\- the MRFC shall include the offered set of predefined ROIs by indicating
them using the \"a=predefined_ROI\" attributes in the SDP offer it sends
within the SIP signalling, where the offered set of predefined ROIs shall be
based on the predefined ROIs offered by the client designated by the MRFC as
the ROI-sending client.;
\- the MRFC shall include the \"extended RTP header for Sent ROI\" information
element for Predefined ROI when seizing resources in the MRFP to indicate the
MRFP that it shall allow the RTP header extension for predefined ROI to pass;
and
\- the MRFC shall include the Predefined ROI related \"a=extmap\" attribute in
the SDP offer it sends within the SIP signalling.
If the MRFP does not support the Predefined ROI feature, the MRFC shall send
the SDP offer without any Predefined ROI related SDP attributes within the SIP
signalling.
If the MRFP has been instructed to pass on the extended RTP header for
predefined ROI as described above then:
\- if the MRFP does not apply video transcoding, it shall pass any received
RTP header extension for Predefined ROI to succeeding RTP streams; or
\- if the MRFP applies video transcoding, it shall keep the predefined ROI
information unchanged during the transcoding and copy the received RTP header
extension for Predefined ROI to the succeeding outgoing RTP stream(s) after
transcoding the associated group of packets.
### 5.24.4 \"Arbitrary ROI\" mode
The MRFC and MRFP may support the \"Arbitrary ROI\" mode as specified in 3GPP
TS 26.114 [23]. If the MRFC and MRFP support the \"Arbitrary ROI\", the MRFC
and MRFP shall apply the procedures in the present clause.
Upon receipt of an SDP offer containing an \"a=rtcp-fb\" line with the \"
Arbitrary ROI\" type expressed by the parameter \"3gpp-roi-arbitrary\", as
described in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23], the MRFC shall determine based on the local
policy and the ROI negotiation results on other call legs whether to accept
this \"Arbitrary ROI\" offer. If the \"Arbitrary ROI\" offer is accepted, the
MRFC shall:
\- at the termination towards the ROI-sending client, include the \"Arbitrary
ROI Sent\" information element when seizing resources in the MRFP to indicate
to the MRFP that it shall signal RTCP \"FB ROI\" feedback message(s) related
to arbitrary ROI on that termination and request the MRFP to assign the
related resources for the corresponding RTCP control flow to convey arbitrary
ROI information;
\- at a termination towards an ROI-receiving client, include the \"Arbitrary
ROI Received\" information element when seizing resources in the MRFP to
indicate to the MRFP that it shall accept RTCP \"FB ROI\" feedback message(s)
related to arbitrary ROI on that termination and request the MRFP to assign
the related resources for the corresponding RTCP control flow to convey
arbitrary ROI information; and
\- include \"a=rtcp-fb\" lines related to the \"3gpp-roi-arbitrary\" parameter
in the SDP answer that will be sent within the SIP signalling (see the related
SDP examples in annex A.4.2e of 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]).
NOTE: The RTCP control flow contains multiple RTCP packet types.
If the MRFP does not support the Arbitrary ROI feature or the MRFC determines
that the \"Arbitrary ROI\" offer should not be accepted based on the local
policy and the ROI negotiation results on other call legs, the MRFC shall send
the SDP answer without any \"a=rtcp-fb\" lines related to the \"3gpp-roi-
arbitrary\" parameter within the SIP signalling.
Upon receipt of an SDP offer containing \"a=extmap\" attribute(s), as defined
in IETF RFC 5285 [27], and the \"a=extmap\" attribute(s) contain the arbitrary
ROI URN(s) (i.e. the ROI URN for carriage of arbitrary region of interest
information in the sent video stream is given by \"urn:3gpp:roi-sent\") as
defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23], then the MRFC shall determine based on the
local policy and the ROI negotiation results on other call legs whether to
accept this \"Arbitrary ROI\" offer. If the \"Arbitrary ROI\" offer is
accepted, the MRFC shall:
\- include the \"Extended RTP header for Sent ROI\" information element when
seizing resources in the MRFP to indicate to the MRFP that it shall allow the
RTP header extension for arbitrary ROI to pass; and
\- include \"a=extmap\" attributes containing the arbitrary ROI URN in the SDP
answer that will be sent within the SIP signalling (see the related SDP
examples in annex A.4.2e of 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]).
If the MRFP does not support the Arbitrary ROI feature or the MRFC determines
that the \"Arbitrary ROI\" offer should not be accepted based on the local
policy and the ROI negotiation results on other call legs, the MRFC shall send
the SDP answer without any Arbitrary ROI related \"a=extmap\" attribute within
the SIP signalling.
If the MRFC and MRFP support the Arbitrary ROI feature then before sending an
SDP offer, the MRFC shall:
a) determine based on the local policy and the Arbitrary ROI negotiation
results on other call legs if, and with what configurations to offer Arbitrary
ROI; and
b) if the MRFC determines to offer Arbitrary ROI:
> \- at the termination towards the ROI-sending client, the MRFC shall include
> the \"Arbitrary ROI Sent\" information element when seizing resources in the
> MRFP to indicate to the MRFP that it shall signal RTCP \"FB ROI\" feedback

\- the MRFC shall include \"a=rtcp-fb\" lines related to the \"3gpp-roi-
arbitrary\" parameter in the SDP offer it sends within the SIP signalling;
\- the MRFC shall include the \"extended RTP header for Sent ROI\" information
element for Arbitrary ROI when seizing resources in the MRFP to indicate the
MRFP that it shall allow the RTP header extension for arbitrary ROI to pass;
and
\- the MRFC shall include the Arbitrary ROI related \"a=extmap\" attribute in
the SDP offer it sends within the SIP signalling.
If the MRFP does not support the Arbitrary ROI feature, the MRFC shall send
the SDP offer without any Arbitrary ROI related SDP attributes within the SIP
signalling.
If the MRFP has been instructed to pass on the extended RTP header for
arbitrary ROI as described above then:
\- if the MRFP does not apply video transcoding, it shall pass any received
RTP header extension for Arbitrary ROI to succeeding RTP streams; or
\- if the MRFP applies video transcoding, it shall keep the arbitrary ROI
information unchanged during the transcoding and copy the received RTP header
extension for Arbitrary ROI to the succeeding outgoing RTP stream(s) after
transcoding the associated group of packets.
## 5.25 Rate adaptation for media endpoints
If the MRFC and the MRFP support rate adaptation for media endpoints using the
enhanced bandwidth negotiation mechanism defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23] the
requirements and procedures in the present clause apply.
If the MRFC receives an SDP offer containing the SDP \"a=bw-info\"
attribute(s), defined in clause 19 of 3GPP TS 26.114 [23] the MRFC shall:
\- select the payload types (codecs and codec configurations) from the
received SDP offer;
\- if the received SDP offer contained the SDP \"a=bw-info\" attribute(s) for
the selected codec:
a) construct appropriate SDP \"a=bw-info\" attribute(s) for the selected codec
according to the rules in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]; and
NOTE 1: The MRFP can modify the related SDP \"a=bw-info\" attribute(s)
according to operator policies as specified in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23].
NOTE 2: The offer/answer negotiation is performed for each \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute line, payload type, direction and bandwidth property individually.
b) include the \"Additional Bandwidth Properties\" information element
containing \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute(s) in the remote descriptor describing
bandwidths that will be used for the selected codec in the sending direction
towards the preceding node when requesting the MRFP to reserve resources; and
NOTE 3: The included information corresponds to \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute(s)
in the sent SDP answer for the \"send\" or \"sendrecv\" direction.
\- include the selected codec with the corresponding SDP \"a=bw-info\"
attribute(s) in the SDP answer.
If the MRFC sends the SDP offer the MRFC shall include, in accordance with
local configuration, for the each offered payload type appropriate bandwidth
information in \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines(s).
If the MRFC then receives the SDP answer with the SDP \"a=bw-info\"
attribute(s) the MRFC shall, when requesting the MRFP to configure resources,
include for the selected payload type the \"Additional Bandwidth Properties\"
information element containing the \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute(s) providing
information for the selected codec in the remote descriptor about bandwidths
that will be used for the selected codec in the sending direction towards the
succeeding node.
NOTE 4: The included information corresponds to \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute(s)
in the received SDP answer for the \"recv\" or \"sendrecv\" direction.
The MRFP may use the \"Additional Bandwidth Properties\" information element
indicating media bandwidth range for rate adaptation (i.e. to select an
appropriate encoding and redundancy) when transcoding media streams.
# 6 MRFC-MRFP Procedures
## 6.1 Non-Call Related Procedures
### 6.1.1 General
The non-call related procedures are based on corresponding procedures of 3GPP
TS 23.205[7] when the MRFC takes the place of the MSC server and the MRFP
takes the place of the MGW.
### 6.1.2 MRFP Unavailable
The MRFC recognises that the MRFP is unavailable in the following 4 cases:
1\. The signalling connection is unavailable
Figure 6.1.2.1: Signalling connection failure
2\. The MRFP indicates the failure condition to all connected MRFCs
Figure 6.1.2.2: MRFP indicates the Failure/Maintenance locking
The failure indication indicates that the MRFP will soon go out of service and
that no new connections should be established using this MRFP. The MRFP can
choose between the \"graceful\" and the \"forced\" method. In the graceful
method the connections are cleared when the corresponding calls are
disconnected. In the forced method all connection are cleared immediately.
3\. The MRFC recognises that the MRFP is not functioning correctly, e.g.
because there is no reply on periodic sending of Audits. The periodic sending
of Audits by MRFC should persist.
4\. The MRFP indicates the maintenance locking condition to all concerned
MRFCs.
The maintenance locking indication indicates that the MRFP is locked for new
calls and that no new connections shall be established using this MRFP. The
MRFP can choose between the \"graceful\" and the \"forced\" method. In the
graceful method the connections are cleared when the corresponding calls are
disconnected. In the forced method all connection are cleared immediately
In all of the above cases the MRFC shall prevent the usage of the MRFP until
the MRFP has recovered or the communication with the MRFP is restored.
### 6.1.3 MRFP Available
The MRFC discovers that the MRFP is available when it receives an MRFP
Communication Up message or an MRFP Restoration message. When the MRFC
discovers that the MRFP is available the following shall occur:
1\. Signalling recovery
The MRFP indicates to all connected MRFCs that the signalling connection is
restored.
Figure 6.1.3.1: Communication goes up
2\. MRFP restoration/maintenance unlocking indication.
> The MRFP indicates to all connected MRFCs that normal operation has resumed.
Figure 6.1.3.2: MRFP indicates recovery from a failure/or maintenance
unlocking
NOTE: This procedure may be used after recovery from a signalling failure.
3\. The MRFC recognises that the MRFP is now functioning correctly, e.g.
because there is a reply on periodic sending of Audits.
After this the MRFC can use the MRFP. If none of 1,2, or 3 happens the MRFC
can initiate the MRFC Ordered Re-register procedure**.**
### 6.1.4 MRFP Recovery
If the MRFP recovers from a failure, is maintenance unlocked, or it has been
restarted, it registers to its known MRFCs using the MRFP Restoration
procedure or the MRFP Registration procedure. The MRFP can indicate whether
the Service has been restored or whether it has restarted with a cold or warm
boot. The response sent to the MRFP indicates a signalling address to be used
by the MRFP.
Figure 6.1.4.1: MRFP Restoration
Figure 6.1.4.2 MRFP Registration
After the recovery the MRFC can use the MRFP.
### 6.1.5 MRFC Recovery
#### 6.1.5.1 General
If an MRFP-unavailable condition is provoked by a failure/recovery action, the
MRFC recovery sequence will, from an information flow point of view, look like
MRFP unavailable and then MRFP available. If an MRFP-unavailable condition is
not provoked, the MRFC recovery sequence will look like MRFP available.
After the information flow, the terminations affected by the recovery action
are released.
#### 6.1.5.2 MRFC Restoration
Figure 6.1.5.2.1: MRFC Restoration
NOTE: Normal release procedure may also be initiated.
After the recovery action is complete and it is possible to signal to the MRFP
the MRFC starts a timer Tw. If recovery indications are not received (MRFP
Communication Up or MRFP Restoration) from the MRFP during Tw an Audit is
sent. If the MRFC receives a recovery indication or MRFP communication up
indication, it shall acknowledge the indication before the MRFC Restoration
may be sent or the release procedure is initiated.
### 6.1.6 MRFP Re-register
When the MRFC requests an MRFP to perform a registration (see clause 6.1.7),
the MRFP performs a re-registration to the MRFC which is defined in the MRFC
address.
Figure 6.1.6.1: Re-registration of an MRFP
### 6.1.7 MRFP Re-registration Ordered by MRFC
If the MRFC knows that communication is possible, but the MRFP has not
registered, the MRFC can order re-registration of the MRFP.
Figure 6.1.7.1: Re-registration ordered by the MRFC
If the re-registration request is accepted the MRFP uses the MRFP Re-register
procedure to register with the MRFC.
### 6.1.8 Audit of MRFP
#### 6.1.8.1 Audit of Value
The MRFC may request the MRFP to report the current values assigned to
distinct objects in the MRFP.
Figure 6.1.8.1.1: Audit Value
### 6.1.8.2 Audit of Capability
The MRFC may request the MRFP to report the capabilities of distinct objects
in the MRFP.
Figure 6.1.8.2.1: Audit Capability
### 6.1.9 MRFP Capability Change
The MRFP reports a change of capability of distinct objects in the MRFP.
Figure 6.1.9.1: Capability Update
The MRFC can use the Audit Value and/or Audit Capability procedures to obtain
further information, about the objects whose capabilities have changed.
### 6.1.10 MRFC Out of service
Figure 6.1.10.1: MRFC Out of Service
If an MRFC discovers that it wants to go out of service it starts an MRFC Out
of Service procedure. The MRFC can indicate whether it requires the context to
be cleared immediately (forced) or cleared when all terminations are
released.(Graceful)
### 6.1.11 MRFP Resource Congestion Handling -- Activate
When the MRFC requires that an MRFP congestion notification mechanism be
applied in the MRFP, the MRFC shall use the MRFP Resource Congestion Handling
- Activate procedure towards the MRFP.
Figure 6.1.11.1: MRFP Resource Congestion Handling - Activate
### 6.1.12 MRFP Resource Congestion Handling -Indication
When the MRFC receives a load reduction notification from the MRFP via the
MRFP Resource Congestion Handling - Indication procedure, the MRFC tries to
reduce the processing load that the MRFC creates on the MRFP. The MRFP shall
decide the actual level of traffic reduction.
Figure 6.1.12.1: MRFP Resource Congestion Handling-Indication
## 6.1.13 Hanging termination detection
Whenever requesting new IP bearer terminations, the MRFC shall request the
MRFP to periodically report termination heartbeat indications to detect
hanging context and termination in the MRFP that may result e.g. from a loss
of communication between the MRFC and the MRFP.
When the MRFC receives a termination heartbeat notification from the MRFP via
the Termination heartbeat - Indication procedure, the MRFC shall return a
Termination heartbeat --Indication Ack (without an error) if the context id /
termination identity combination exists in the MRFC. If it does not exist, the
MRFC shall return an error and shall correct the mismatch, e.g. by requesting
the MRFP to subtract the indicated termination and to clear any associated
context.
Figure 6.1.13.1: Termination heartbeat -- Indication
## 6.2 Call Related Procedures
### 6.2.1 Play Tone Procedure
#### 6.2.1.1 General
The following procedure assumes the IMS session has been established and the
bearer is through-connected and the MRFC has received a trigger to play a tone
and the MRFP selected for the call has the capabilities to provide tones.
NOTE: This procedure may also be ordered in combination with the session
establishment procedure.
#### 6.2.1.2 Send tone
After reception of a trigger to play a tone, the MRFC shall initiate the Send
tone procedure. The MRFC may request the MRFP to send tone to one, multiple or
all terminations in a context simultaneously with the tone identifier. The
tone identifier may be a pre-configured identifier.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to send tone continuously until requested to be
stopped. Alternatively, duration may be indicated or provisioned in the MRFP.
When the duration elapses, the tone shall be stopped.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to detect DTMF digits, and may request the MRFP
to stop sending tone when a DTMF digit is detected. For the second case, only
the tone completion event is notified.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to detect the tone completion, and notify the
completion event and cause to the MRFC. The tone is completed when either of
the following has occurred;
\- the duration has elapsed or:
\- a DTMF digit is detected by the MRFP or:
\- the sending tone is not successful.
#### 6.2.1.3 Stop tone
On receipt of a trigger to stop a tone, the MRFC shall request the MRFP to
stop the tone.
#### 6.2.1.4 Tone completed
When a tone is completed, if the MRFC has requested the MRFP to notify the
tone completion, the MRFP shall notify the tone completion event and the cause
to the MRFC. The cause that the tone is completed may be that the duration has
elapsed, a DTMF digit is detected by the MRFP, or that the tone is not
successful. Then the MRFC may indicate to the AS that the tone has been
stopped.
#### 6.2.1.5 Message sequence chart
Figure 6.2.1.1 shows the message sequence chart example for sending tone.
Figure 6.2.1.1 Sending tone (message sequence chart)
### 6.2.2 Play Announcement Procedure
#### 6.2.2.1 General
The following procedure assumes the IMS session has been established and the
bearer is through-connected, and the MRFC has received a trigger to play
announcement, and the MRFP selected for the call has the capabilities to
provide announcement.
NOTE: This procedure may also be ordered in combination with the session
establishment procedure.
#### 6.2.2.2 Start announcement
After reception of a trigger to play the announcement, the MRFC should
initiate the Start announcement procedure. The MRFC shall request the MRFP to
play announcement to one, multiple or all terminations in a context with the
announcement identifier. The announcement identifier may be a pre-configured
identifier (such as a number).
If it is a sequence of announcements, the MRFC shall request the MRFP to play
all the announcements with one request. The MRFC may request the MRFP to play
the announcement in a loop continuously until requested to be stopped or in a
loop with a fixed number of times. For the second case, if the fixed number of
times is exhausted, the announcement is completed successfully.
If it is a variable announcement, the MRFC may indicate to the MRFP the
following variants to the announcements:
\- Date: A date variant is made up of three components: day, month and year.
The MRFC shall indicate the date value and the date format to the MRFP, such
as \" day-month-year\" or \"year-month-day\".
\- Time: A time variant is made up of two components: hour and minute, The
MRFC shall indicate the time value and the time format to the MRFP, such as
\"12-hours format\" or \"24-hours format\".
\- Digits (the announcement may contain a number of digits to be controlled by
the MRFC for example a telephone number): a digits variant is made up of a
sequence digit.
\- Money (currency).
\- Integer (a value within the announcement that is controlled by the MRFC,
e.g. \"you are caller number 3 in the queue\"): an integer variant may be
spoken as a cardinal or ordinal value. The MRFC shall indicate to the MRFP the
value and type to be spoken.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to detect DTMF digit while playing an
announcement, and may request the MRFP to stop playing an announcement when a
DTMF digit is detected. For the latter case, only the announcement completion
event is notified.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to detect the announcement completion, and
notify the completion event and cause to the MRFC. The announcement is
completed when either of the following has occurred;
\- the announcement has been completed successfully or:
\- a DTMF digit is detected by the MRFP or:
\- the playing announcement is not successful.
#### 6.2.2.3 Stop announcement
On receipt of a trigger to stop the announcement, the MRFC shall request the
MRFP to stop the announcement.
#### 6.2.2.4 Announcement completed
When an announcement is completed, if the MRFC has requested the MRFP to
notify the announcement completion, the MRFP shall notify the announcement
completion event and the cause to the MRFC. The cause that the announcement is
completed may be the announcement has been completed successfully, or a DTMF
digit is detected by the MRFP, or the playing announcement is not successful.
Then the MRFC may indicate to the AS that the announcement has been stopped.
#### 6.2.2.5 Message sequence chart
Figure 6.2.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for playing
announcement.

bearer is through-connected, and the MRFC has received a trigger to play TTS,
and the MRFP selected for the call has the capabilities to provide TTS.
NOTE: This procedure may also be ordered in combination with the session
establishment procedure.
#### 6.2.3.2 Start TTS
After reception of a trigger to play TTS, the MRFC should initiate the Start
TTS procedure.
If the MRFC receives a VXML script, the MRFC shall extract the SSML script or
the SSML file identifier from the VXML script. If the MRFC receives plain
text, the MRFC shall generate a SSML script that includes this plain text
(\) and the language type (xml:lang) used the basic SSML format. If the
size of the SSML script is larger than the transport capability of the Mp
interface, the MRFC shall stop the Start TTS procedure and return error.
Then the MRFC shall indicate to the MRFP the SSML script or the SSML file
identifier to play the SSML text to one, one of many, multiple or all

### 6.2.4 Audio Record Procedure
#### 6.2.4.1 General
The following procedure assumes the IMS session has been established and the
bearer is through-connected, and the MRFC has received a trigger to record
audio, and the MRFP selected for the call has the capabilities to provide
audio record.
NOTE: This procedure may also be ordered in combination with the session
establishment procedure.
#### 6.2.4.2 Start audio record
After reception of a trigger to record audio, the MRFC should initiate the
Start audio record procedure. The MRFC shall request the MRFP to record audio
from one or all terminations in a context with the record file URI and record
file format. If it is to record one party, only the input stream of the party
is recorded. If it is to record all parties, the mixed stream of all parties
is recorded.
When recording audio from all terminations in a context (for two-party
sessions or a conference) the MRFC may request the MRFP to assign a new
termination to record the audio in the context.
If other signals such as playing announcement are requested to be executed on
the same termination as the termination to perform the recording the signals
shall not override each other, e.g. the recording shall not be interrupted.
The record file URI can be generated by the AS/MRFC or by the MRFP. For the
second case, the MRFC shall indicate the MRFP to generate the URI and return
the generated URI to the MRFC. The record file format is the 3GPP multimedia
file format, defined in the 3GPP TS 26.244[5], and only the audio track is
used for the audio recording. The MRFC may indicate the maximum record time to
the MRFP. When the maximum record time has elapsed, the MRFP shall stop the
audio recording.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to detect the audio recording completion, and
notify the completion event and cause to the MRFC. The audio recording is
completed when either of the following has occurred;
\- the maximum time period of audio recording has elapsed,
\- no input is detected,
> \- DTMF digits are detected by the MRFP where the DTMF key sequence shall
> stop or cancel the audio recording ,
\- the MRFC requests the MRFP to stop the audio recording, or:
\- the audio recording is not successful.
#### 6.2.4.3 Stop audio record
After reception of a trigger to stop audio record, the MRFC shall request the
MRFP to stop the audio recording. If the audio recording termination is added,
the MRFC shall request the MRFP to subtract it.
#### 6.2.4.4 Audio record completed
When an audio recording is completed, if the audio recording is successful,
the MRFP shall save the record file to the specified URI. If the audio
recording is not successful, the MRFP shall delete the record file. If the
MRFC has requested the MRFP to notify the audio recording completion, the MRFP
shall notify the audio recording completion event and the cause to the MRFC.
The cause of the audio recording completed may be no voice has been input
during a specific period, the maximum record time has elapsed, a DTMF digit
that represents to finish or cancel the audio recording is detected by the
MRFP, or the audio recording is not successful. Then the MRFC may indicate to
the AS that the audio record has been stopped.
#### 6.2.4.5 Message sequence chart

On receipt of a request to detect DTMF Digits, the MRFC may command the MRFP
to report DTMF Digits as defined in the Detect DTMF Procedure.
MRFC shall assign the RTP Payload Type for DTMF Telephony Events. When a DTMF
Digit has been detected by the MRFP it shall report it to the MRFC.
When requested to detect DTMF the MRFP shall not forward the reported digit
toward another connection.
An example sequence is shown in Figure 6.2.5.1.
Figure 6.2.5.1 DTMF Telephony Event Detection
DTMF digit detection may be stopped by the MRFC sending the procedure Stop
DTMF Detection. The MFRP, once it has acknowledged this request will no longer
check for DTMF digits or report them to the MRFC.
### 6.2.6 Automatic Speech Recognition Procedure
#### 6.2.6.1 General
The following procedure assumes the IMS session has been established and the
bearer is through-connected, and the MRFC has received a trigger to play ASR,
and the MRFP selected for the call has the capabilities to provide Automatic
Speech Recognition.
NOTE: This procedure may also be ordered in combination with the session
establishment procedure.
#### 6.2.6.2 Start ASR
If the MRFC receives a request to initiate ASR, the MRFC shall extract the
SRGS script or the SRGS URI from the received script.
If the size of the SRGS script is larger than the transport capability of the
Mp interface, the MRFC shall terminate ASR procedure and return error.
Otherwise the MRFC initiates the Start ASR procedure; the MRFC shall indicate
to the MRFP the SRGS script or the SRGS URI to play ASR to one termination in
a context.
The MRFC may indicate to the MRFP the recognition mode: Normal Recognition
Mode, Hotword Recognition Mode. If the MRFC indicate the Normal Recognition
Mode to the MRFP, the MRFP shall match all of the speech against a recognition
grammar and returns a no-match status if the input fails to match or the
method times out. If the MRFC indicates the Hot-word Recognition Mode to the
MRFP, the MRFP shall look for a match against specific speech grammar and
ignores speech that does not match.
The MRFP shall recognize the subscriber\'s input speech stream according to
the SRGS grammar, and output the result as the EMMA format.
If the MRFP does not support an element of the SRGS, the MRFP may ignore the
element.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to detect DTMF digit while executing ASR, and
may request the MRFP to stop ASR when a DTMF digits is detected. For the
latter case, only the ASR result is notified.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to detect the ASR completion and notify the
completion event and cause to the MRFC. The ASR is completed when either of
the following has occurred;
\- the ASR has been completed successfully,
\- a DTMF digit is detected by the MRFP,
\- the executing of ASR is not successful or
\- the recognition time elapses.
#### 6.2.6.3 Stop ASR
On receipt of a trigger to stop ASR, the MRFC shall request the MRFP to stop
the ASR.
6.2.6.4 ASR Completed
When an ASR is completed, if the MRFC has requested the MRFP to notify the ASR
completion, the MRFP shall notify the ASR result and the cause to the MRFC.
The cause of the ASR completed may be that the ASR has been completed
successfully, a DTMF digit is detected by the MRFP, or the executing ASR is
not successful.
The MRFP shall generate the ASR result as the EMMA format. The EMMA result may
include multiple recognition results that are mutually exclusive. Each result
may be structured by multiple parts in time sequence with the input time. Each
result may include the text token that the value will correspond to tokens as
defined by the SRGS grammar. Each result may include the interpretation of
application specific markup. Each result may include the confidence score that
represents the recognition quality.
If the size of the EMMA script is larger than the transport capability of the
Mp interface, the MRFP shall return the MRFC the ASR is not successful.
Then the MRFC may indicate to the AS that the ASR has been stopped and the ASR
result.

\- Message filtering.
An MRFC and an MRFP that support a session based messaging, as defined in IETF
RFC 4975 [18], shall support the following procedures.
When receiving an SDP offer for a MSRP media, the MRFC:
\- shall provide the value of the received \"a=path\" SDP attribute (defined
in IETF RFC 4975 [18]) to the MRFP in the \"MSRP URI Path\" information
element, as part of a remote descriptor;
\- shall indicate \"TCP/MSRP\" or \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" (if e2e media security is
applied) as transport protocol to the MRFP;
\- if the \"a=msrp-cema\" SDP attribute, as defined in IETF RFC 6714 40, is
not contained in the SDP offer, should use the IP address and port within the
first entry of the \"a=path\" SDP attribute from the received SDP offer to
configure the remote IP address and port at the MRFP;
NOTE 1: It is a normal MRFC procedure to configure the received SDP \"c=\"
line and \"m=\" line IP address and TCP port information as the remote address
and port at the MRFP. The SDP \"c=\" line and \"m=\" line address and port
information will match the \"a=path\" address information unless there is an
MSRP relay in the path.
\- shall request the MRFP to allocate the IP address, TCP port and MSRP
session-id and provide this information in the \"MSRP URI Path\" information
element;
\- shall include the \"a=path\" SDP attribute received from the MRFP in an SDP
answer it sends; and
\- if the SDP offer included the \"a=msrp-cema\" SDP attribute, shall include
the \"a=msrp-cema\" SDP attribute in the SDP answer.
When sending an SDP offer for MSRP media, the MRFC:
\- shall request the MRFP to allocate an IP address, TCP port and MSRP
session-id and provide this information in the \"MSRP URI Path\" information
element;
\- shall indicate \"TCP/MSRP\" or \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" (if e2e media security is
applied) as transport protocol to the MRFP;
\- shall include the value of the \"MSRP URI Path\" information element
received from the MRFP in the \"a=path\" SDP attribute of the SDP offer it
sends; and
\- should include the \"a=msrp-cema\" SDP attribute in the SDP offer.
When receiving a corresponding SDP answer for MSRP media, the MRFC:
\- shall provide the value of the received \"a=path\" SDP attribute to the
MRFP in the \"MSRP URI Path\" information element; and
\- if the \"a=msrp-cema\" SDP attribute is not contained in the SDP answer,
should use the IP address and TCP port within the first entry of the
\"a=path\" SDP attribute from the received SDP answer to configure the remote
IP address and port at the MRFP.
When the MRFP is configured to handle MSRP media and is requested to allocate
an IP address, TCP port and MSRP session-id, it shall provide this information
in the \"a=path\" SDP attribute and shall store this information. When the
MRFP then receives MSRP packets, it shall compare the session-id part of the
received MSRP packets with the stored session-id.
NOTE 2: Comparing only the session-id, but not the address information, is in
accordance with IETF draft-ietf-simple-msrp-sessmatch-10, but also compatible
with peers using IETF RFC 4975 [18] without extensions or in combination with
IETF RFC 6714 40. No procedures to indicate the method of session matching
(according to IETF RFC 4975 [18] or IETF draft-ietf-simple-msrp-sessmatch-10)
to the MRFP are defined.
The MRFP shall include MSRP URI(s) received in the \"MSRP URI Path\"
information element from the MRFC in the \"To-Path\" header field of MSRP
packets it sends.
##### 6.2.10.3.2 Messages Statistics
The MRFP may report the statistics for the number of messages sent and/or
received in two ways described as following.
1\. The MRFC indicates quotas granted to the MRFP. The granted quotas indicate
the units specifying the number of messages or volume of messages allowed to
be received or sent by users. The MRFC may also indicate to the MRFP a valid
time together with the granted quotas. The valid time indicates the time until
the specific unit may be measured, after which the quota shall be reported,
whether or not it has reached its granted quota. The MRFC initiates this via
the \"Configure Granted Quota\" procedure as specified in clause 8.50. The
quotas granted by MRFC may include any of the following:
\- Quota for number of messages sent
\- Quota for number of messages received
\- Quota for volume (size) of messages sent
\- Quota for volume (size) of messages received
When the quota granted is reached or the valid time elapses the MRFP shall
report statistics information of messages according to the indication by the
MRFC. The MRFP uses the \"Report Message Statistics\" procedure as specified
in clause 8.51 to report the statistics of messages. The statstistics of
messages sent and/or received may include any of the following:
\- number of messages sent
\- number of messages received
\- volume (size) of messages sent
\- volume (size) of messages received
\- reason for report i.e. quota reached or granted time elapsed
2\. The MRFC requests the MRFP to report the statistics information of
messages sent and/or received at the end of the session or during the session.
In this case, the quotas or the valid time is not required, and the MRFP
should report the statistics of message as requested by the MRFC. The
statstistics of messages are the same as described above.
Figure 6.2.10.3.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for reporting
message statistics.
Figure 6.2.10.3.2.1 Message statistics according to the granted quota
###### 6.2.10.3.3 Message Filtering
When the MRFC receives the trigger to config the filtering rules, the MRFC may
initiate the \"Configure Filtering Rules\" procedure as specified in clause
8.52 to set filtering rules in the MRFP. The filtering rule is composed of two
parts: the criteria and the treatment of the filtered message. The MRFP should
handle messages according to the filtering rules.
The MRFC may indicate to the MRFP the following criterias:
\- Sender address
\- Message size
\- Message content type (e.g. video, audio)
\- Message content format(e.g. mpeg, jpeg)
\- Message subject
The MRFC may indicate to the MRFP the following message treatments:
\- Block the delivery of the message content
\- Store the message content
\- Redirect the message to another address
The MRFC may indicate to the MRFP the \"store url\" when messages storage is
needed, or the MRFC may indicate the MRFP to allocate the \"store url\" and
return the generated \"store url\" to the MRFC.
The MRFC may indicate to the MRFP the \"redirect url\" when messages
redirection is needed.
Figure 6.2.10.3.3.1 shows the message sequence chart example to config the
filtering rules.
Figure 6.2.10.3.3.1 Configure the filtering rules
### 6.2.11 Audio Transcoding Procedure
As transcoding is considered a basic feature of a MRFP, the MRFC does not
explicitly request transcoding. It is expected that the MRFP determines when
transcoding is applied, for example, when the MRFC specifies the audio codec
to be applied for a given stream in a context, if there are any other audio
terminations in the context and the stream modes permit data flow between
these terminations and where the source encodings are not compatible then the
MRFP transcodes the stream between these terminations.
### 6.2.12 Video Transcoding Procedure
As transcoding is considered a basic feature of an MRFP the MRFC does not
explicitly request transcoding. It is expected that the MRFP determines when
transcoding is applied, for example, when the MRFC specifies the video codec
to be applied for a given stream in a context, if there are any other
terminations supporting video in the context and the stream modes permit data
flow between these terminations and where the source encodings are not
compatible then the MRFP transcodes the stream between these terminations.
### 6.2.13 Floor Control
#### 6.2.13.1 General
Floor control offers control of shared conference resources at the MRFP(s).
Floor control protocol (BFCP) is used to convey the Floor control messages
between the Floor Chair of the conference, the Floor Control Server, and the
Floor Participants of the conference. All Floor control messages go via the
Floor Control Server. Processing (granting or rejecting) Floor control
requests is done by the one or more Floor chairs or by the FCS itself,
depending on the Floor Control Policy.
The location of the Floor Control Server may be in either the MRFC or the MRFP
depending on the complexity/distribution of the conference. However when
located in the MRFP, the MRFP shall forward the Floor request decision to the
MRFC in order to execute the changes to the Floor Participant\'s granted
permissions.
#### 6.2.13.2 Floor Control within the MRFP
##### 6.2.13.2.1 Floor Control Connection Establishment
The set of data to establish a BFCP connection shall be exchanged in
accordance with IETF RFC 4583 [21]. A Floor control connection, which requires
a BFCP/TCP protocol termination property, shall be established between the UE
and the Floor Control Server, located in the MRFP. The MRFC shall initiate the
\"Configure BFCP Termination\" procedure as specified in clause 8.44 to
indicate to the MRFP the remote Floor control Client connection address and
request the local Floor control Client connection address. The MRFP shall
return the local Floor control Client connection address to the MRFC. The
Floor control connection may be initiated by the UE or the MRFP (FCS).
\- It is a prerequisite that the conference is configured using \"Configure
Conference for Floor Control\" procedure as described in clause 6.2.13.2.2,
which is used to set the common data of the conference for Floor control.
The combined sequence is shown in Figure 6.2.13.2.1.1
Figure 6.2.13.2.1.1: Combined procedures to Configure Conference and add a
Floor Control Termination
##### 6.2.13.2.2 Configure Conference and Floor Control Policy Indication
The \"Configure Conference For Floor Control\" procedure, specified in Clause
8.45 shall be used to set up a conference and to modify FCS properties such as
the Floor Control Policy. The procedure defines common data for all BFCP
users, these properties are defined on Context level.
The common data include:
\- Floor-Resource Associations, which indicates the correlation between Floor
ID and media properties for the MRFP to identify the Floor(s) when receiving
BFCP requests and notifying the MRFC of decisions to change the floor
permissions for a given user (termination).
\- Conference Identifier, which indicates the Conference Identifier for the
BFCP client to identify the conference when sending BFCP requests.
Floor Control Policy. This consists of:
\- The Floor control algorithm to be used in granting the Floor, either:
\- The FCFS algorithm or
\- The chair-controlled algorithm.
\- The maximum number of users who can hold the Floor at the same time.
Figure 6.2.13.2.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for configuring a
conference for Floor control.
Figure 6.2.13.2.2.1 Procedure to Configure Conference for Floor Control
##### 6.2.13.2.3 Floor Chair Designation
If the Floor Control Policy indicates that the conference is Chair-controlled,
the MRFC shall indicate to the MRFP which termination represents the Floor
Chair and which Floor(s) the Floor Chair controls using the \"Designate Floor
Chair\" procedure as specified in clause 8.46.
The MRFC may also change the Floor Chair as needed using the \"Designate Floor
Chair\" procedure as specified in clause 8.46.
NOTE: There may be one or more Floor Chairs in a conference. But one media
stream can be controlled by only one chair.
It is a prerequisite that the conference is configured and the termination
configured for BFCP using \"Configure Conference for Floor Control\" and
\"Configure BFCP Termination\" procedures respectively.
NOTE: These procedures may be requested at same time.
Figure 6.2.13.2.3.1 shows the message sequence chart example for designating
Floor Chair.
Figure 6.2.13.2.3.1 Procedure to designate Floor Chair
##### 6.2.13.2.4 Floor Request Decision
The MRFC shall request the MRFP to notify the decision of Floor request using
the \"Floor Decision Request\" procedure as specified in clause 8.47. The MRFP
shall then notify the MRFC the outcome of the Floor Request, when the FCS has
made the decision to change the status to \"Granted\", \" Released \" or \"
Revoked \" ( The status is defined as REQUEST-STATUS in IETF RFC 4582[20]),
using the \"Report Floor Status Decision\" procedure as specified in clause
8.48.
The Floor Request Decision information is used by the MRFC to decide how to
set the media properties of the associated Termination/Stream on the MRFP.
The MRFP shall indicate the Floor Identity or Identities to which the Floor
decision is associated. The MRFP sends one notification per Floor decision for
a given termination and only one notification per termination shall be
outstanding at any time.
Figure 6.2.13.2.4.1 shows the message sequence chart example for requesting
and reporting Floor Request decisions.
Figure 6.2.13.2.4.1 Procedure to request and report Floor Request decisions
##### 6.2.13.2.5 Media Update and Confirmation
The MRFC modifies media properties associated with the Floor Request Decision
received from the MRFP using the \"Modify Media\" procedure defined in Clause
8.59; this will be either adding permissions if the \"status\" was granted or
removing the permissions if the \"status\" was revoked or released. The MRFC
shall indicate to the MRFP when it has successfully modified the media
properties based on the provided Floor Request Decisions notification using
the \"Confirm Media Update \" procedure as specified in clause 8.49. The MRFP
shall then modify the Floor status of the associated Client.
Figure 6.2.13.2.5.1 shows the message sequence chart example for modifying the
media and confirming media update based on Floor Request status.
Figure 6.2.13.2.5.1 Procedures to modify the media and confirm media update
##### 6.2.13.2.6 Floor Control Procedure
A Floor Participant may request one or more Floors by sending a BFCP request
message to the MRFP (FCS).
The MRFP (FCS) informs the Floor Chair, if present, about a Floor
Participant\'s Floor request via BFCP.
The Floor Chair sends to the MRFP (FCS) the decision to the Floor
Participant\'s Floor requests. If the Floor is not Chair-controlled, the FCS
located in the MRFP shall make the decision itself according to the Floor
Control Algorithm.
The MRFP shall notify the MRFC the Floor change request decision via the
\"Report Floor Request Decision\" procedure described in Clause 6.2.13.2.4.
The MRFC requests the MRFP to modify the media properties associated with the
Floor Request decision as described in Clause 6.2.13.2.5.
The MRFC informs the MRFP that the requested media changes to satisfy the new
Floor permissions have been completed using the \"Confirm Media Update\"
procedure, see Clause 8.49.
The MRFC may request the MRFP to play tones or announcements for indicating
when a user gains or loses Floor permissions.
##### 6.2.13.2.7 Floor Control Connection Release
When the MRFC receives an indication that the Floor control connection is to
be closed, the MRFC shall command the MRFP to release the Floor control
connections.
The Floor control connection shall also be released by the MRFP when the
termination for that connection is removed.
The Floor related BFCP signalling resources are released by the MRFP when the
Floor control connection is released.
If a Floor Participant owns a Floor when releasing the Floor control
connection, the MRFP(FCS) shall revoke the Floor permission.
##### 6.2.13.2.8 Example Message sequence chart
Figure 6.2.13.1 shows the message sequence chart example for Floor control on
a termination which is not the Floor Chair.
Figure 6.2.13.1 Floor control (message sequence chart)
### 6.2.14 Explicit Congestion Notification Support
#### 6.2.14.1 General
If the MRFC receives a SDP Offer containing ECN negotiation, see IETF RFC 6679
[25], and the MRFC and MRFP support ECN and at least some of the
initialisation methods offered within the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute,
NOTE: Only the \"leap\" initialisation method is supported over the Mp
interface in this release.
the MRFC shall:
\- act as an end point for ECN;
\- return a SDP Answer according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [23] and the capabilities
of the MRFP, containing the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute; and
\- indicate to the MRFP that it shall apply the ECN procedures (according to
3GPP TS 26.114 [23]) and act as an ECT endpoint.
NOTE: ECN XR summary reports and RTCP AVPF ECN feedback message are not
supported in this release.
When creating the SDP Offer the MRFC may initiate ECN negotiation (in
accordance with 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]), indicating the capabilities of the MRFP.
If the MRFC receives the SDP Answer also containing ECN attributes (indicating
successful ECN negotiation) then it shall indicate to the MRFP that it shall
apply the ECN procedures (according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [23]) and act as an ECT
endpoint.
The following ECN parameters are preconfigured in the MRFP:
\- Initialisation = \"leap\";
\- Mode = \"setread\";
\- ECT Marking = ECT-0;
\- Feedback is via Application Specific Adaptation Requests (i.e. Receiver
Driven Congestion Control).
The MRFP should not send RTCP XR ECN summary reports.
The procedure to configure the MRFP for ECN may be combined with any other
procedure requesting media resource from the MRFP.
#### 6.2.14.2 Message sequence chart, Request ECN
Figure 6.2.14.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for requesting
Explicit Congestion Notification.
Figure 6.2.14.2.1: Procedure to Request ECN
Upon receipt of a request to apply Explicit Congestion Notification the MRFP
shall set the ECN field of the IP header in accordance with 3GPP TS 26.114
[23] when sending any data packets.
Upon receipt of any IP headers indicating Congestion Experienced (ECN-CE) the
MRFP shall trigger rate adaptation in accordance with 3GPP TS 26.114 [23].
#### 6.2.14.3 Message sequence chart, Report ECN Failure Event
Figure 6.2.14.3.1 shows the message sequence chart example for ECN Failure
Event.
Figure 6.2.14.3.1: Procedure to Report ECN Failure
When the MRFC receives a Notification indicating that an error has occurred it
may trigger a new SDP offer to remove ECN.
### 6.2.15 Multimedia Priority Service Congestion Control Procedures
#### 6.2.15.1 General
The MRFC and MRFP may support the priority treatment of a call/session
identified as an MPS call/session. This clause describes the Mp signalling
procedures and their interactions with SIP signalling in the control plane and
with user plane procedures to support the requirements for MPS. These Mp
signalling procedures may or may not apply depending on the network
configuration (e.g. whether the MRFP is shared by multiple MRFCs or whether
the MRFC controls multiple MRFPs for a given route -- Media Gateway Group).
The MRFC can receive a SIP INVITE with MPS priority information (see 3GPP TS
23.228 [1], clause 5.21).
#### 6.2.15.2 MRFP Resource Congestion in ADD response, request is queued
If the MRFC requests a resource via the Reserve and Configure IMS Resources
procedure or Reserve IMS Resources procedure and receives an error indicating
that the requested resource could not be seized (e.g. H.248 error code #510
\"insufficient resources\") and the MRFC does not have an alternative MRFP
through which it can route the call/session, the MRFC queues the priority
call/session and gives it priority over any further Reserve and Configure IMS
Resources or Reserve IMS Resources procedures for lower priority
calls/sessions towards this MRFP until the requested resource for this queued
call/session is successfully seized. The example sequence is shown in Figure
6.2.15.2.1.
Figure 6.2.15.2.1: Request to Reserve MPS priority call resources when MRFP is
congested
#### 6.2.15.3 MRFP Resource Congestion in ADD response, MRFC seizes new MRFP
If the MRFC requests a resource via the Reserve and Configure IMS Resources
procedure or Reserve IMS Resources procedure and receives an error indicating
that the requested resources could not be seized due to congestion (e.g. H.248
error code #510 \"insufficient resources\") and Media Gateway Groups are
implemented the MRFC seizes a new MRFP from the same Media Gateway Group
before resorting to any queuing of the priority call/session (as described in
6.2.15.2) to enable the MPS call/session to proceed as early as possible.
#### 6.2.15.4 MRFP Priority Resource Allocation
If the MRFP supports the Priority information (determined through provisioning
or package profile), the MRFC requests a resource via the Reserve and
Configure IMS Resources procedure or Reserve IMS Resources procedure and
includes the Priority information. The MRFP may then provide priority
allocation of resources once a congestion threshold is reached. The example
sequence is shown in Figure 6.2.15.4.1. If the MRFP is completely congested it
shall indicate this to the MRFC as described in 6.2.15.2.
Figure 6.2.15.4.1: Request to reserve MPS priority call resources when MRFP is
congested, priority resources are allocated
#### 6.2.15.5 MRFP Priority User Data marking
The MRFC may request the streams associated to an MPS call/session to be
marked with certain priority code point. The MRFP shall then mark each IP
packet header accordingly. The example sequence is shown in Figure 6.2.15.5.1.
Figure 6.2.15.5.1: Request to reserve IMS resources and apply DSCP marking for
MPS
The MRFP may also provide priority allocation for resources requested via a
subsequent Configure IMS Resources procedure not including Priority
information if the related context has been marked with priority information
during the Reserve IMS Resources procedure or Reserve and Configure IMS
Resources procedure.
### 6.2.16 Coordination of Video Orientation
Figure 6.2.16.1 shows the message sequence chart example for indicating
extended RTP header for the Coordination of Video Orientation (CVO).
Figure 6.2.16.1: Procedure to indicate RTP extension header for CVO
When the MRFC requests the IMS resources from the MRFP, the MRFC may
optionally request the MRFP to support the RTP header extension capability as
defined in IETF RFC 5285 [27].
### 6.2.17 Support of generic image attributes
#### 6.2.17.1 General
The MRFC and the MRFP may support the media-level SDP image attribute defined
in IETF RFC 6236 [28] as required by 3GPP TS 26.114 [23].
If the MRFP and the MRFC support the negotiation of the image size and if the
MRFC receives the SDP image attribute(s) \"a=imageattr\" then the MRFC may
send the generic image attribute parameter to the MRFP when seizing or
modifying a termination.
The list of image sizes per payload type supported by the MRFP shall be
preconfigured in the MRFC. If the image sizes received within an SDP body on
the Mr interface are not all supported by the MRFP then the MRFC shall only
send the list of corresponding MRFP supported image sizes to the MRFP. If no
image size is supported by the MRFP, the MRFC shall not send the generic image
attribute parameter to the MRFP.
#### 6.2.17.2 Indication of generic image attributes
The MRFC may include the generic image attributes to the MRFP. The example
sequence is shown in figure 6.2.17.2.1.
Figure 6.2.17.2.1: Request to reserve IMS resources with generic image
attribute

### 6.2.19 End-to-end security for TCP based media using TLS
#### 6.2.19.1 General
The MRFC and the MFRP may support e2e protection of TCP based media using the
pre-shared key ciphersuites for TLS (specified in IETF RFC 4279 [34]) and the
MIKEY-TICKET mechanism (specified in IETF RFC 6043 [33] with the profiling of
tickets and procedures given in 3GPP TS 33.328 [31]).
The following clauses describe extensions to the Mp signalling procedures and
their interactions with SIP signalling in control plane and with user plane
procedures if the e2e security for TCP based media using TLS and KMS is
supported by the MRFC and the MFRP.
#### 6.2.19.2 Specific procedures for session based messaging (MSRP)
##### 6.2.19.2.1 IMS UE originating procedures (\"dial-in\" scenario) for e2e
Figure 6.2.19.2.1.1 shows a \"dial-in\" conference procedure for one MSRP
session using TLS and KMS based security.
NOTE: In the shown example it is assumed that the UE-A and the MRFC/MRFP
support IETF RFC 6714 [n1].
Figure 6.2.19.2.1.1: UE connecting into a messaging conference - example call
flow for e2e case
The IMS UE-A and the MRFC perform an IMS conference session set-up according
to 3GPP TS 23.228 [1], 3GPP TS 24.247 [17] and with modifications described in
3GPP TS 33.328 [31]. The procedure in the figure 6.2.19.2.1.1 for requesting
e2e security for a media stream is described step-by-step with an emphasis on
the additional aspects for the MRFC and the MRFP of the e2e media protection
using TLS and KMS.
1\. Depending on the KMS and a local policy, the IMS UE-A will either interact
with the KMS to obtain keys and a MIKEY-TICKET ticket usable for the MRFC, or
it will create the ticket by itself.
The IMS UE-A generates the TRANSFER_INIT message according to IETF RFC 6043
[33] containing the ticket associated with the MRFC. A single Crypto Session
is included in the TRANSFER_INIT message as described in Annex H.3 of 3GPP TS
33.328 [31]. The protocol type in the Crypto Session is set to TLS.
The IMS UE-A creates an SDP offer with an MSRP based media over TLS transport
protocol and inserts \"a=setup:actpass\" SDP attribute specified in IETF RFC
4145 [36] and key management protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute specified
in IETF RFC 4567 [35] which indicates use of the MIKEY-TICKET ticket and
contains the TRANSFER_INIT message encapsulated in a keymgmt-data field.
2\. The IMS UE-A sends the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer.
3\. Upon reception of the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer containing a
media stream that uses \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" transport protocol, the MRFC checks
for the presence of the key management protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute.
If it indicates the usage of the MIKEY the MRFC extracts a key management data
from a keymgmt-data field and \"base64\" decodes them to reconstruct the
original TRANSFER_INIT message. The MRFC checks if it is authorized to resolve
the ticket and if that is the case the MRFC interacts with the KMS to resolve
the ticket and receive keys.
4\. - 6. The MRFC uses the \"Reserve And Configure IMS resources\" procedure
to request a termination for \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" media. The MRFC provides an IP
address and port received from the IMS UE-A and includes a Pre-Shared Key
information element containing the derived PSK i.e. the Traffic-Encrypting Key
associated with the Crypto Session that will be used by the MRFP in TLS
handshake. The MRFC includes a Notify TCP connection establishment Failure
Event information element to request the MRFP to report an unsuccessful TCP
connection set-up and a Notify TLS session establishment Failure Event
information element to request the MRFP to report an unsuccessful TLS session
set-up. In accordance to the information in the \"a=setup\" SDP attribute that
will be sent in an SDP answer the MFRC requests the MRFP to start a TCP
connection establishment and to start a TLS session once the TCP connection is
established.
7\. The MRFP sends a TCP SYN message towards the IMS UE-A to establish a TCP
connection. The IMS UE-A answers with a TCP SYN ACK message and the MRFP
replies with a TCP ACK message, completing the TCP connection establishment.
8\. Upon completion of the TCP connection establishment, the MRFP starts a TLS
session establishment using the received Pre-Shared Key information element to
set-up a TLS-PSK tunnel to protect MSRP messages.
9\. The MRFC includes the MIKEY-TICKET response in the TRANSFER_RESP message
created according to IETF RFC 6043 [33]. The MRFC inserts the key management
protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute which indicates use of the MIKEY-TICKET
ticket and contains the \"base64\" encoded TRANSFER_RESP message. The
TRANSFER_RESP message includes the information required for the generation of
keys.
10\. The MRFC sends the SIP 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional
response) to the SIP INVITE request with the SDP answer to the IMS UE-A.
After receiving the SIP 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional response)
to the SIP INVITE request with the SDP answer the IMS UE-A extracts a key
management data from the keymgmt-data field and \"base64\" decodes them to
reconstruct the original TRANSFER-RESP message. The IMS UE-A verifies the
TRANSFER-RESP message according to IETF RFC 6043 [33] and then verifies that
the authenticated identity of the recipient corresponds to the policy for the
MSRP session before completing the media security set-up.
##### 6.2.19.2.2 IMS UE terminating procedures (\"dial-out\" scenario) for e2e
Figure 6.2.19.2.2.1 shows a \"dial-out\" conference procedure for one MSRP
session using TLS and KMS based security.
NOTE: In the shown example it is assumed that the UE-B and the MRFC/MRFP
support IETF RFC 6714 [n1].
Figure 6.2.19.2.2.1: Terminating (\"dial-out\") example call flow for e2e case
The MRFC and the IMS UE-B performs an IMS \"dial-out\" conference session set-
up according to 3GPP TS 23.228 [1], 3GPP TS 24.147 [4] and with modifications
described in 3GPP TS 33.328 [31].
The procedure in the figure 6.2.19.2.2.1 for requesting e2e security for a
media stream is described step-by-step with an emphasis on the additional
aspects for the MRFC and the MRFP of the e2e media protection using TLS and
KMS.
1\. The MRFC receives a trigger to create an ad-hoc conference. Depending on
the KMS and a local policy, the MRFC will either interact with the KMS to
obtain keys and a MIKEY-TICKET ticket usable for the IMS UE-B, or it will
create the ticket by itself. In the latter case, MIKEY-TICKET mode 3 as
specified in IETF RFC 6043 [33] is used, and the MRFC will then perform all
key and ticket generation functions otherwise performed by the KMS.
The MRFC generates the TRANSFER_INIT message according to IETF RFC 6043 [33].
The identities of the initiator and the responder in the message are the KMS
user identities derived from the URI\'s in the To and From header fields in
the SIP INVITE request.
A single Crypto Session is included in the TRANSFER_INIT message as described
in Annex H.3 of 3GPP TS 33.328 [31]. The protocol type in the Crypto Session
is set to TLS.
2\. - 4. The MRFC uses the \"Reserve IMS resources\" procedure to request a
termination for \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" media towards the IMS UE-B.
5\. The MRFC creates an SDP offer with an MSRP based media over TLS transport
protocol and inserts the \"a=setup:actpass\" SDP attribute specified in IETF
RFC 4145 [36] and the key management protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute
specified in IETF RFC 4567 [35] which indicates the use of the MIKEY-TICKET
ticket and contains the TRANSFER_INIT message encapsulated in a keymgmt-data
field.
6\. The MRFC sends the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer to the IMS UE-B.
7\. Upon reception of the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer containing a
media stream that uses transport \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\", the IMS UE-B checks if it
is authorized to resolve a ticket and if that is the case the IMS UE-B
interacts with the KMS to resolve the ticket and receive keys.
8\. The IMS UE-B includes the MIKEY-TICKET response in the TRANSFER_RESP
message created according to IETF RFC 6043 [33]. The IMS UE-B inserts the key
management protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute specified in IETF RFC 4567
[35].
The IMS UE-B sends the SIP 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional
response) to the SIP INVITE request with an SDP answer.
9\. - 11. After receiving the SIP 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional
response) to the SIP INVITE request with the SDP answer the MRFC extracts a
key management data from the keymgmt-data field and \"base64\" decodes them to
reconstruct the original TRANSFER-RESP message. The MRFC verifies the
TRANSFER-RESP message according to IETF RFC 6043 [33] and then verifies that
the authenticated identity of the recipient corresponds to the policy for the
MSRP session before completing the media security set-up.
The MRFC uses the \"Configure IMS resources\" procedure to configure a
termination towards the IMS UE-B with an IP address and port received from the
IMS UE-B and includes a Pre-Shared Key information element containing the
derived PSK i.e. the Traffic-Encrypting Key associated with the Crypto Session
that will be used by the MRFP in TLS handshake. The MRFC includes a Notify TCP
connection establishment Failure Event information element to request
reporting of an unsuccessful TCP connection set-up and a Notify TLS session
establishment Failure Event information element to request reporting of un
unsuccessful TLS session set-up.
12\. The IMS UE-B sends a TCP SYN message towards the MRFP to establish a TCP
connection. The MRFP answers with a TCP SYN ACK message and the IMS UE-B
replies with a TCP ACK message, completing the TCP connection establishment.
13\. Upon completion of the TCP connection establishment, the IMS UE-B starts
a TLS session establishment using the received Pre-Shared Key information
element to set-up a TLS-PSK tunnel to protect MSRP messages.
#### 6.2.19.3 Specific procedures for Floor Control Service (BFCP)
##### 6.2.19.3.1 IMS UE requesting e2e protected Floor control connection
Figure 6.2.19.3.1.1 shows a \"dial-in\" conference procedure for one BFCP
session with an e2e media protection using TLS and KMS based security.
Figure 6.2.19.3.1.1: UE requesting Floor control connection with FCS/MRFP -
example call flow for e2e case
The IMS UE-A wants to establish a Floor control connection with a Floor
Control Server (FCS), located in the MRFP. The IMS UE-A and the MRFC perform a
Floor control connection set-up according to 3GPP TS 23.228 [3], 3GPP TS
24.147 [21] and with modifications described in 3GPP TS 33.328 [2].
The procedure in the figure 6.2.19.3.1.1 for requesting e2e security of the
Floor control connection is described step-by-step with an emphasis on the
additional aspects for the MRFC and the MRFP of the e2e media protection using
TLS and KMS.
1\. As step 1 in clause 6.2.19.2.1.
2\. As step 2 in clause 6.2.19.2.1 with the exception that SDP offer indicates
\"TCP/TLS/BFCP\" as transport protocol.
3\. As step 3 in clause 6.2.19.2.1.
4\. - 6. The MRFC uses the \"Configure BFCP Termination\" procedure to request
a termination for \"TCP/TLS/BFCP\" media. The MRFC provides an IP address and
port received from the IMS UE-A and includes a Pre-Shared Key information
element containing the derived PSK i.e. the Traffic-Encrypting Key associated
with the Crypto Session that will be used by the MRFP in TLS handshake. The
MRFC includes a Notify TCP connection establishment Failure Event information
element to request the MRFP to report an unsuccessful TCP connection set-up
and a Notify TLS session establishment Failure Event information element to
request the MRFP to report an unsuccessful TLS session set-up. In accordance
to the information in the \"a=setup\" SDP attribute that will be sent in an
SDP answer the MFRC requests the MRFP to start a TCP connection establishment.
7\. As step 7 in clause 6.2.19.2.1.
8\. As step 9 in clause 6.2.19.2.1.
9\. As step 10 in clause 6.2.19.2.1 with the exception that the SDP answer
indicates \"TCP/TLS/BFCP\" as transport protocol.
10\. Upon completion of the TCP connection establishment and the reception of
the SDP answer with a key management data, the IMS UE-A starts a TLS session
establishment, in accordance to IETF RFC 4583 [21], using the received PSK to
set-up a TLS-PSK tunnel to protect MSRP messages.
#### 6.2.19.4 TLS session establishment Failure Indication
The MRFP shall use a Notify TLS session establishment Failure Indication
procedure to report TLS session establishment related failures.
The figure 6.2.19.4.1 shows the message sequence chart example when the MRFP
reports an unsuccessful TLS session set-up to the MRFC.

### 6.2.20 TCP bearer connection control
#### 6.2.20.1 TCP connection establishment
Figure 6.2.20.1.1 shows an example call flow for a MSRP session set-up
procedure, where the UE wants to join a messaging conference.
NOTE: In the shown example it is assumed that the UE-A and the MRFC/MRFP
support IETF RFC 6714 40.
Figure 6.2.20.1.1: UE connecting into a messaging conference
The IMS UE-A and the MRFC perform an IMS conference session set-up according
to 3GPP TS 23.228 [1], 3GPP TS 24.247 [17] and 3GPP TS 24.147 [4]. The
procedure in the figure 6.2.20.1.1 is described step-by-step with an emphasis
on the additional aspects for the MRFC and the MRFP of the TCP connection
establishment.
1\. The IMS UE-A wants to join a messaging conference. For this purpose the
IMS UE-A assigns a local TCP port number for the MSRP communication and builds
an SDP offer containing the \"a=setup:actpass\" SDP attribute specified in
IETF RFC 4145 [36].
The IMS UE-A sends the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer.
2\. - 4. Upon reception of the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer
containing a media stream that uses \"TCP/MSRP\" transport protocol, the MRFC
uses the \"Reserve And Configure IMS resources\" procedure to request a
termination for \"TCP/MSRP\" media. The MRFC provides an IP address and TCP
port received from the IMS UE-A as part of a remote descriptor, requests the
MRFP to allocate a local IP address and TCP port and includes a Notify TCP
connection establishment Failure Event information element to request the MRFP
to report an unsuccessful TCP connection set-up. In accordance to the
information in the \"a=setup\" SDP attribute that will be sent in an SDP
answer the MFRC requests the MRFP to start a TCP connection establishment.
5\. The MRFP sends a TCP SYN message towards the IMS UE-A to establish a TCP
connection. The IMS UE-A answers with a TCP SYN ACK message and the MRFP
replies with a TCP ACK message, completing the TCP connection establishment.
6\. The MRFC builds the SDP answer containing the \"a=setup:active\" SDP
attribute and inserts the IP address and TCP port received from the MRFP.
7\. The MRFC sends the 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional response)
to the SIP INVITE request with the SDP answer for the MSRP session towards the
IMS UE-A.
#### 6.2.20.2 TCP connection establishment Failure Indication
The MRFP shall use a Notify TCP connection establishment Failure Indication
procedure to report TCP connection establishment related failures.

for \"Predefined ROI\" type expressed by the parameter \"3gpp-roi-
predefined\", as described in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23], media-level SDP predefined
ROI attribute \"a=predefined_ROI\" defined in TS 26.114 [23] to negotiate the
predefined ROI for sending and receiving video, and the RTP header extension
capability for carriage of predefined ROI information as defined in IETF RFC
5285 [27] and 3GPP TS 26.114 [23].

for carriage of arbitrary ROI information as defined in IETF RFC 5285 [27] and
3GPP TS 26.114 [23].
### 6.2.23 Rate adaptation for media endpoints
The signalling flow shown in figure 6.2.23.1 gives an example for a multimedia
conference establishment (\"dial-in\" conference procedure) when rate
adaptation for media endpoints using the \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute (defined
in clause 19 of 3GPP TS 26.114 [23] to negotiate the additional bandwidth
properties) is supported by the MRFC and the MRFP.
Figure 6.2.23.1: Multimedia conference establishment (\"dial-in\" procedure)
with support of the enhanced bandwidth negotiation mechanism
The procedure in the figure 6.2.23.1 is described step-by-step with an
emphasis on the additional aspects for the MRFC and the MRFP of the rate
adaptation for media endpoints using the enhanced bandwidth negotiation
mechanism.
1\. The MRFC receives the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer containing for
the offered payload types \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines.
2\. The MRFC selects the payload type from the received SDP offer. The
received SDP offer contained \"a=bw-info\" attribute(s) lines for the selected
payload type.
3\. -- 5. The MRFC uses the \"Reserve and Configure IMS resources\" procedure
to request media resources and for the selected payload type (codec and codec
configurations) the MRFC provides to the MRFP the \"Additional Bandwidth
Properties\" information element containing in the remote descriptor \"a=bw-
info\" SDP attribute lines describing the bandwidth range which the MRFP will
use in the sending direction towards the conference participant and which
correspond to \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines indicating receiving direction
in the received SDP offer in step 1.
The encoder in the MRFP will use media bandwidth range for rate adaptation
(i.e. to select an appropriate encoding and redundancy) when transcoding media
streams.
6\. The MRFC inserts in the SDP answer the IP address and RTP port received
from the MRFP and for the selected payload type the \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute lines.
7\. The MRFC sends towards the conference participant the 200 (OK) final
response (or 18x provisional response) to the SIP INVITE request with the SDP
answer containing for the selected payload type \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute
lines.
The signalling flow shown in figure 6.2.23.2 gives an example for a multimedia
conference establishment (\"dial-out \" conference procedure) when the rate
adaptation for media endpoints using the enhanced bandwidth negotiation
mechanism is supported by the MRFC and the MRFP.
Figure 6.2.23.2: Multimedia conference establishment (\"dial-out\" procedure)
with support of the enhanced bandwidth negotiation mechanism
The procedure in the figure 6.2.23.2 is described step-by-step with an
emphasis on the additional aspects for the MRFC and the MRFP of the rate
adaptation for media endpoints using the enhanced bandwidth negotiation
mechanism.
1\. The MRFC receives a trigger to create an ad-hoc conference.
2\. Based on the local configuration the MRFC creates \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute(s) for the offered payload types.
3\. -- 5. The MRFC uses the \"Reserve IMS resources\" procedure to request
resources from the MRFP.
6\. The MRFC inserts in the SDP offer the IP address and RTP port received
from the MRFP and for the offered payload types the \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute lines created in step 2.
7\. The MRFC sends the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer containing for
the offered payload types \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines towards the
conference participant.
8\. The MRFC receives the 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional
response) to the SIP INVITE request with the SDP answer containing for the
selected payload type \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines.
9\. -- 11. The MRFC uses the \"Configure IMS resources\" procedure to
configure media resources and for the selected payload type the MRFC provides
to the MRFP the \"Additional Bandwidth Properties\" information element
containing in the remote descriptor \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines with the
values received in step 8 describing the bandwidth range which the MRFP will
use in the sending direction towards the conference participant and which
correspond to \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines indicating receiving direction
in the received SDP answer in step 8.
The encoder in the MRFP will use media bandwidth range for rate adaptation
(i.e. to select an appropriate encoding and redundancy) when transcoding media
streams.
