# 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support the mission critical push to talk (MCPTT)
service including the common services core architecture for identity
management, group management, and configuration management required to support
the MCPTT voice service. Support for both MCPTT group calls and MCPTT private
calls operating in on-network and off-network modes of operation is specified.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2].
The present document is applicable primarily to MCPTT voice service using
E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [9].
Certain MCPTT functions such as dispatch and administrative functions could
also be supported via non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality
is specified to support non-3GPP access.
The MCPTT service requires preferential handling compared to normal
telecommunication services e.g. in support of police or fire brigade including
the handling of prioritised MCPTT calls for emergency and imminent threats.
The MCPTT service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
In the present document, MCPTT calls between MCPTT users on different MCPTT
systems are considered, however, for roaming only EPC-level roaming and IMS-
level roaming are considered i.e. partner MCPTT system based roaming (also
known as \"migration\") is out of scope.

# 4 Introduction
The MCPTT service supports communication between several users (i.e. group
call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the permission to
talk in an arbitrated manner. The MCPTT service also supports private calls
between two users.
The MCPTT architecture utilises aspects of the IMS architecture defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [5], the Proximity-based Services (ProSe) architecture defined
in 3GPP TS 23.303 [8], the Group Communication System Enablers for LTE
(GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [10] and the PS-PS access
transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.237 [6] to enable support of the
MCPTT service.
The MCPTT UE primarily obtains access to the MCPTT service via E-UTRAN, using
the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [9]. Certain MCPTT functions
such as dispatch and administrative functions can be supported using either
MCPTT UEs in E-UTRAN or using MCPTT UEs via non-3GPP access networks.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MCPTT service administrators are
considered MCPTT UEs in the MCPTT architecture.
MCPTT UEs that use non-3GPP access can only support a subset of the
functionality specified in this specification that is supported by the
non-3GPP access network.
# 5 Assumptions and architectural requirements
## 5.1 Assumptions
### 5.1.1 Service continuity
Service continuity feature shall only be supported between on-network MCPTT
service and UE-to-network relay MCPTT service as specified in 3GPP TS 23.237
[6], for both group calls and private calls.
The MCPTT UE, prior to going out of E-UTRAN coverage, should attempt to make
use of a ProSe UE-to-network relay in order to support the service continuity.
### 5.1.2 Trust domain
For an MCPTT system, the trust domain consists of one or more MCPTT functions
that are administered by the same or different service providers (e.g. MCPTT
service provider, PLMN operator) that have an agreement to share sensitive
information.
For the MCPTT architecture, the following rules are implied for functions in
different trust domains:
\- A public user identity shall not identify an MCPTT user in a different
trust domain (see subclause 8.3.1);
\- A public service identity shall not identify an MCPTT group ID in a
different trust domain (see subclause 8.3.2);
\- A SIP database shall not pass responses to a registrar or registrar finder
in a different trust domain (see subclause 7.4.3.2.1); and
\- An HTTP proxy shall not pass requests or responses to another HTTP proxy,
an HTTP server or an HTTP client in a different trust domain (see subclause
7.4.3.3.2).
## 5.2 Architectural requirements
### 5.2.1 General architectural requirements
General MCPTT architectural requirements include:
a) To develop economies of scale, it will be useful if PLMN operators can
reuse the MCPTT architecture for non-public safety customers that require
similar functionality. These PLMN operators may want to integrate many
components of the MCPTT solution with their existing network architecture.
Hence a functional decomposition of MCPTT into a small number of distinct
logical functions is required.
b) The architecture should enable an application plane and signalling control
plane split for the provision of the MCPTT service.
c) To enable parts of the MCPTT solution to be reused for other applications,
the architecture should enable the group management functions (e.g. admission
control; linking of groups;) to be implemented on a separate node from the
main PTT functions (e.g. \"call\" setup/termination; allocation of TMGI to UE;
floor control;).
d) There is a need to promptly form (and release) groups of users that span
multiple public safety network administrations. To enable this, the
architecture should provide the relevant interfaces between public safety
networks.
### 5.2.2 Roaming requirements
The MCPTT application can provide MCPTT service to users in various PLMNs.
Roaming is supported using EPC-level roaming or IMS-level roaming.
### 5.2.3 Media routing requirements
The voice media flow for a private call shall be routed according to one of
the following two options:
a) Option 1:
1) Through the primary MCPTT system if both users in the call belong to the
same organisation; or
2) Through the primary MCPTT system of both users, if the users in the call do
not belong to the same organisation.
b) Option 2: The voice media flow may be routed locally, under the control of
the primary MCPTT system, through an entity allowing the duplication of the
media flow to the primary MCPTT system of each user.
The voice media flow for a group call shall be routed to the group home MCPTT
system.
The routing of media flow shall be end-to-end from transmitter to receiver(s),
except for the MCPTT control function.
### 5.2.4 Requirements for user identity management
To allow for confidentiality of user identities in various cases of business
relationship as defined in clause 6, the MCPTT application may provide public
user identities to the MCPTT UE, to be used by MCPTT UE for MCPTT services.
### 5.2.5 Group affiliation and de-affiliation
Group affiliation can be achieved through the following two methods:
a) Explicit affiliation: An MCPTT user provides interest in one or many MCPTT
groups using the MCPTT UE. An MCPTT authorized user may remotely modify
another MCPTT user\'s affiliation to an MCPTT group.
b) Implicit affiliation: MCPTT user\'s affiliations to MCPTT groups are
determined through configurations and policies at the MCPTT UE or MCPTT
service and performed implicitly by the associated MCPTT UE or MCPTT service.
NOTE: Group affiliation is not the same as group membership; however, an MCPTT
user is a member of a group prior to becoming an affiliated member of that
group.
The following functionality shall be enabled by the MCPTT service for the
MCPTT users affiliated to the MCPTT groups:
\- MCPTT users receive notifications for group call setup and invitation for
their affiliated group(s).
\- MCPTT users can select amongst their affiliated group a selected MCPTT
group for media transmission. Thus, allowing the MCPTT user to initiate a new
group call or transmit in an existing group call.
\- MCPTT users receive media and events from their affiliated group(s).
Group de-affiliation indicates that the MCPTT user is no longer affiliated to
that MCPTT group, and therefore is not able to perform any actions that are
associated with an affiliated member (e.g. receive media, notifications). De-
affiliation can occur either through MCPTT user\'s explicit request, or
implicitly (e.g. changed as the result of another action, such as the user
logging off).
### 5.2.6 MCPTT call requirements
#### 5.2.6.1 General
The on-network MCPTT service shall support the use of pre-established
sessions.
#### 5.2.6.2 Group call requirements
The MCPTT service shall support the chat group (restricted) call model for
MCPTT group call.
The MCPTT service shall support the pre-arranged group call model for MCPTT
group call.
### 5.2.7 GCS AS requirements for the MCPTT service
Point to multipoint broadcast offered by the LTE MBMS technology is well
suited to group communications, which form a major part of the public safety
related communications. MCPTT relies on this capability in the form of MCPTT
MBMS, in addition to unicast communications and off-network communications
(ProSe).
The MCPTT on-network architecture, is based in part on 3GPP TS 23.468 [10]
with the MCPTT AS assuming the function of the GCS AS and can be represented
(in a simplified diagram) as shown in figure 5.2.7-1:
Figure 5.2.7-1: MCPTT on-network architecture showing MBMS
The MCPTT server is shown being bundled with the GCS AS within the same
network entity. It is illustrated this way for simplicity of the diagram.
MCPTT media content is transmitted via LTE bearers, which are communication
pipes with one end in the MCPTT server and the other end in the MCPTT UE. The
uplink bearers are always allocated as unicast, but the downlink bearers can
be allocated as unicast or as MBMS bearers, or both.
An MBMS bearer (both network and radio part) is uniquely identified via a TMGI
or via a combination of a TMGI and a flow identifier (see 3GPP TS 23.246 [7]).
The MCPTT server is capable, via the MB2 interface, to request the creation of
MBMS bearers and associate a unique TMGI or a combination of a TMGI and a flow
identifier (see 3GPP TS 23.468 [10]). The MCPTT server may determine the MBMS
broadcast area based on the cell identities of the affiliated group members
received over MCPTT-1. The MCPTT server may determine for a user the switching
from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer based on the information reported over
MCPTT-1.
### 5.2.8 UE-to-network relay MCPTT service requirements
To support the requirement that a public safety ProSe UE-to-network relay
shall be able to restrict the relayed group communication on a per group
basis, the MCPTT service should be able to provide a means for an MCPTT
administrator to configure a ProSe UE-to-network relay with a list of allowed
MCPTT groups. For each allowed MCPTT group, a unique associated relay service
code should be allocated and it may be provided to the relay UE from MCPTT
application server or DPF.
NOTE: According to the PLMN operator\'s configuration, one relay service code
can map to one or multiple MCPTT group(s).
### 5.2.9 Bearer management
#### 5.2.9.1 General
The MCPTT UE shall use an MCPTT service APN for the SIP-1 reference point, an
MC common core services APN for the HTTP-1 reference point and a MC identity
management service APN for the CSC‑1 reference point. The value of each of
these APNs:
\- may be the same or may differ;
\- may be the same as other non-MCPTT services that have compatible QoS and
PDN (see NOTE); and
\- shall be made available to the UE either via UE (pre)configuration or via
initial UE configuration (see subclause 10.1.1) on a per HPLMN and optionally
also a per VPLMN basis.
NOTE: The APN value of \"IMS\" is a well-known APN, whose PDN connection
characteristics are defined in GSMA PRD IR.92 [18] and GSMA PRD IR.88 [19],
and which is used in some deployments for operator IMS‑based services e.g.
Voice over LTE. This well-known APN can be used for the MCPTT service APN if
the SIP core belongs to the PLMN operator and both the PLMN operator and MCPTT
service provider have agreed which QoS aspects to utilise i.e. either the QoS
aspects defined in subclause 5.2.9.2.1 or the QoS aspects defined in GSMA PRD
IR.92 [18] and GSMA PRD IR.88 [19].
The MCPTT UE may utilise PDN access credentials as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401
[9] (e.g. PAP, CHAP) to access the PDNs identified by the MCPTT service APN,
the MC common core services APN and the MC identity management service APN. If
PDN access credentials are required then they shall be made available to the
UE via initial UE configuration (see subclause 10.1.1) on a per APN basis.
The PDN connection to the MCPTT related APNs can be of type \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\"
or \"IPv4v6\" (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [9]). If a PDN connection to an MCPTT system
specific APN is of type \"IPv4v6\" then the MCPTT client shall use UE
configuration to determine whether to use IPv4 or IPv6.
#### 5.2.9.2 EPS bearer considerations
##### 5.2.9.2.1 Considerations for the EPS bearer to the MCPTT service PDN
If the PDN connection established during the initial attach by the UE is to an
APN other than the MCPTT service APN, then prior to user authentication, the
UE shall establish another PDN connection to the MCPTT service APN. PDN
connection establishment can also be caused by a SIP registration request for
MCPTT.
The QCI value of 69 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [4]) shall be used for the
EPS bearer that transports SIP-1 reference point messaging.
##### 5.2.9.2.2 Considerations for the EPS bearer to the MC common core
services PDN and MC identity management service PDN
The QCI value 8 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [4]) or better shall be used
for the EPS bearer that transports HTTP-1 reference point messaging.
#### 5.2.9.3 EPS unicast bearer considerations for MCPTT
For an MCPTT call session request, resources shall be requested utilising
interaction with dynamic PCC. The MCPTT system shall request resources over Rx
to a PCRF. The dedicated bearer for voice and MCPTT-4 reference point
messaging shall utilise the QCI value of 65 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203
[4]). The request of resources over Rx shall include an application identifier
for MCPTT in order for the PCRF to evaluate the correct QCI.
The UE is required to support at minimum one UM bearer which is used for MCPTT
voice (see annex B in 3GPP TS 36.331 [14]).
Depending on operator policy:
\- the MCPTT system may be able to request modification of the priority (ARP)
of an existing bearer without the need to initiate a new dedicated GBR bearer;
or
\- the EPS bearers for MCPTT call may enable pre-emption of lower priority EPS
bearers if the maximum number of UM bearers has been reached in favour of
MCPTT initiated EPS bearer, if the EPS bearer used for MCPTT call has higher
priority level (ARP) than the UM bearer(s) used for other application(s) and
if the bearers for non MCPTT application are pre-emptable.In this case, the
EPS bearer for MCPTT call pre-empts one of the existing EPS bearers when the
maximum number of bearers is established for other applications.
NOTE 1: Operator policy takes into account regional/national requirements.
The EPS bearer for MCPTT emergency call shall have highest priority level
among MCPTT call types. The EPS bearer for MCPTT imminent peril call shall
have higher priority level than one for MCPTT call.
To ensure that the MCPTT service always has access to a dedicated bearer for
MCPTT media, a pre-established session may be setup that includes a request
for resources at the first MCPTT group affiliation.
This means that the PCC may multiplex MCPTT media streams from multiple
concurrent MCPTT calls into one EPS bearer on one shared network priority
regardless of MCPTT call priority.
NOTE 2: A single UM bearer is used to multiplex the media streams from
multiple concurrent MCPTT calls.
NOTE 3: The sharing of a single GBR bearer for voice means that different QCI
and/or ARP values are not possible for different voice media streams.
#### 5.2.9.4 MBMS bearer management
When operating in systems that support MBMS functionality, the MCPTT service
shall be able to provide downlink MBMS delivery of MCPTT media.
When operating in systems that support MBMS functionality, the MCPTT service
shall be able to provide downlink MBMS delivery of floor control messages
targeted towards multiple MCPTT clients at the same time (specifically floor
idle and floor taken).
MCPTT UEs shall be able to receive the traffic delivered via MBMS, regardless
of whether or not they have any unicast radio bearers available.
When switching MCPTT service between different downlink bearers, the MCPTT UE
shall preserve the reception context in order to eliminate or reduce to a
minimum any interruption of service.
The MCPTT service shall enable an MCPTT UE in an ongoing MCPTT group call that
has just entered an area of media delivery via MBMS bearers to immediately
start receiving the media for that MCPTT group call via MBMS.
The MCPTT server shall not map MCPTT group calls to MBMS bearers that cannot
provide the QoS required by the group.
An MCPTT UE that uses MBSFN transmission should be able to support eight MBSFN
areas simultaneously on the same RF carrier.
### 5.2.10 MCPTT system interconnect requirements
The architecture for interconnect between MCPTT systems is specified, allowing
the affiliation of MCPTT users from an MCPTT system with MCPTT groups defined
in another MCPTT system. When both MCPTT systems are served by different
networks, interconnect of signalling and media is achieved using the
interfaces defined for interconnect between PLMNs.
### 5.2.11 MCPTT user profile requirements
The MCPTT user profile shall:
\- be provisioned subject to the MCPTT user authentication by the identity
management server;
\- be available at configuration management server and MCPTT server;
\- be associated with an MCPTT user; and
\- contain an index to uniquely distinguish the MCPTT user profile from other
MCPTT user profiles associated to the same MCPTT user.
For the set of MCPTT user profiles associated to a single MCPTT user, one of
the MCPTT user profiles shall be indicated as the pre-selected MCPTT user
profile to the MCPTT client and the MCPTT server.
The MCPTT user profile may be modified at the configuration management server.
# 6 Involved business relationships
Based on the information in subclause 5.2.1 and subclause 5.2.2, figure 6-1
shows the business relationships that exist and that are needed to support a
single MCPTT user.
Figure 6-1: Business relationships for MCPTT
The MCPTT user belongs to a single mission critical organization based on a
MCPTT user agreement between the MCPTT user and the mission critical
organization. The MCPTT user can have MCPTT user agreement and MCPTT service
arrangement directly with a single MCPTT service provider.
The mission critical organization and the MCPTT service provider can be part
of the same organization, in which case the business relationship between the
two is internal to a single organization. The mission critical organization
can have MCPTT service arrangements with several MCPTT service providers. In
this case, a MCPTT user of a mission critical organization is always served by
only one MCPTT service provider. The MCPTT service provider can have MCPTT
service arrangements with several mission critical organizations. The MCPTT
service provider can have MCPTT user agreements and MCPTT service arrangements
with several MCPTT users.
The MCPTT service provider and the home PLMN operator can be part of the same
organization, in which case the business relationship between the two is
internal to a single organization.
The home PLMN operator can have PLMN operator service arrangements with
multiple MCPTT service providers and the MCPTT service provider can have PLMN
operator service arrangements with multiple home PLMN operators. As part of
the PLMN operator service arrangement between the MCPTT service provider and
the home PLMN operator, PLMN subscription arrangements can be provided which
allows the MCPTT UEs to register with home PLMN operator network.
The home PLMN operator can have PLMN roaming agreements with multiple visited
PLMN operators and the visited PLMN operator can have PLMN roaming agreements
with multiple home PLMN operators.
Where mutual aid operates between MCPTT service providers, figure 6-2 shows
the required additional relationship. An MCPTT user can only affiliate to
groups of the partner MCPTT service provider:
\- if such a service provider agreement exists; or
\- subject to authorisation for a specific group membership from the partner
MCPTT service provider.
Figure 6-2: Additional business relationships for mutual aid
The primary and partner MCPTT service providers do not need to be served by
the same home SIP core operator in order to support mutual communication and
mutual aid when interconnection between the SIP cores is available.
An example of the usage of these business relationships is elaborated for two
users, one resident on its primary MCPTT service provider and one providing
mutual aid within the same group.
User A is a user on MCPTT X in group M. The relationships are as follows:
a) user A has user configuration established with MCPTT X and forms part of
group M;
b) user A uses a PLMN subscription arrangement with PLMN operator R provided
by MCPTT X; and
c) MCPTT X has a PLMN operator service arrangement with PLMN operator R.
User B is a user on MCPTT Y and joins group M as part of a mutual aid:
a) user B has user configuration established with MCPTT Y and forms part of
its own set of groups relating to MCPTT Y;
b) user B uses a PLMN subscription arrangement with PLMN operator S provided
by MCPTT Y;
c) MCPTT Y has a PLMN operator service arrangement with PLMN operator S;
d) MCPTT Y has a service provider agreement with MCPTT X that allows user B to
participate within group M; and
e) PLMN operator S has a PLMN roaming agreement with PLMN operator R allowing
user B to roam to PLMN operator R.
NOTE: There is no requirement that the PLMN operator that user B roams to is
the same PLMN operator that MCPTT X has a service arrangement with. It does
however need to support MCPTT capabilities, and provides service in the same
geographic area as used by MCPTT X.
# 7 Functional model
## 7.1 General
The functional model for the support of MCPTT is defined as a series of planes
to allow for the breakdown of the architectural description.
Further, each plane is expected to operate in an independent manner, providing
services to the connected planes as and when requested by the connected plane,
and requesting services from other planes as required.
As a consequence of this each plane should manage on its own behalf:
a) use of identities. Each plane is therefore responsible for the privacy of
that plane\'s own identities; and
b) security for that plane. This does not preclude a plane requesting security
services from another plane, but that is a decision made within the plane, as
to whether to use offered security services or mechanisms within the plane
itself.
NOTE: Terminology such as client and server are not meant to imply specific
physical implementation of a functional entity.
## 7.2 Description of the planes
The following planes are identified:
a) application plane. The application plane provides all of the services (e.g.
call control, floor control) required by the user together with the necessary
functions to support media control and transfer. It uses the services of the
signalling control plane to support those requirements. The application plane
also provides for the conferencing of media, transcoding of media, and
provision of tones and announcements; and
b) signalling control plane. The signalling control plane provides the
necessary signalling support to establish the association of users involved in
an MCPTT call or other type of call and other services. The signalling control
plane also offers access to and control of services applicable to calls. The
signalling control plane uses the services of the bearer plane.
Bearers supporting these planes are defined for LTE within 3GPP TS 23.401 [9].
The resource control that is needed to support these planes is defined within
3GPP TS 23.203 [4]. The application plane also relies on the use of multicast
bearers established via procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23 468 [10] and 3GPP TS
23.246 [7].
## 7.3 Functional model description
### 7.3.1 On-network functional model
Figure 7.3.1-1 shows the functional model for the application plane.
Figure 7.3.1-1: Functional model for application plane
In the model shown in figure 7.3.1-1, the following apply:
\- The MCPTT server is an instantiation of a GCS AS in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.468 [10].
\- MCPTT-9 carries multicast floor control signalling between the floor
control server of the MCPTT server and the floor participant of the MCPTT UE.
\- MCPTT-4 carries unicast floor control signalling between the floor control
server of the MCPTT server and the floor participant of the MCPTT UE.
\- MCPTT-7 carries unicast media between the media distribution function of
the MCPTT server and the media mixer of the MCPTT UE.
\- MCPTT-8 carries multicast media from the media distribution function of the
MCPTT server to the media mixer of the MCPTT UE.
Figure 7.3.1-2 shows the functional model for the signalling control plane.

point when the group management servers are connected by a single SIP core.
Where they are joined by more than one SIP core, CSC-7 also makes use of the
SIP-3 reference point.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, the HTTP proxy, which provides the interconnection
between HTTP-1, HTTP-2 and HTTP-3 reference points, is not shown in figure
7.3.1-3.

MCPTT servers are not covered in this version of the document.
The MCPTT server functional entity represents a specific instantiation of the
GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [10] to control multicast and unicast
operations for group communications.
The MCPTT server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS, HTTP client and
HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
By assuming the role of a GCS AS, the MCPTT server functional entity is
responsible for:
\- keeping track of MCPTT UE location with respect to multicast service
availability;
\- requesting the allocation of multicast resources utilizing the media
distribution function;
\- announcing the association of multicast resources to calls to MCPTT UEs;
\- determining for each MCPTT UE involved in a given call whether to use
unicast or multicast transport;
\- announcing the assignment of multicast transport for specific calls to
MCPTT UEs; and
\- informing the media distribution function of the media streams requiring
support for a given call.
The MCPTT server shall support the controlling role and the participating
role. The MCPTT server may perform the controlling role for private calls and
group calls. The MCPTT server performing the controlling role for a private
call or group call may also perform a participating role for the same private
call or group call. For each private call and group call, there shall be only
one MCPTT server assuming the controlling role, while one or more MCPTT
servers in participating role may be involved.
The MCPTT server performing the controlling role is responsible for:
\- call control (e.g. policy enforcement for participation in the MCPTT group
calls) towards all the MCPTT users of the group call and private call;

calls) to its MCPTT users for group call and private call;
\- group affiliation support for MCPTT user, including enforcement of maximum
N2 number of simultaneous group affiliations by a user;
\- relaying the call control and floor control messages between the MCPTT
client and the MCPTT server performing the controlling role; and
\- media handling in call for its MCPTT users, i.e. transcoding, recording,
lawful interception for both unicast and multicast media.
For group regrouping involving multiple groups from primary and partner MCPTT
systems,
\- the group host MCPTT server of the temporary group performs the controlling
role and is responsible for the centralized floor control, and for arbitration
according to the temporary group or user policies (e.g., priority);
\- the group host MCPTT server of the constituent MCPTT group is responsible
for providing call invitations to their group members, and for filtering
between constituent group members' floor control requests according to the
constituent group or user policies (e.g., priority); and
\- the MCPTT server responsible for the constituent MCPTT group members
performs the participating role.
##### 7.4.2.3.3 Floor participant

This functional entity is located in the UE for both on-network and off-
network operations.
##### 7.4.2.3.4 Floor control server
This functional entity provides support for centralised floor control for on-
network and distributed floor control for off-network operation. It may
provide arbitration between floor control requests between different users,
grant the floor in response to successful requests, and provide queuing in
cases of contention. For on-network operation, this functional entity is
located with the MCPTT server. For off-network operation, this functional
entity is located in the UE.
##### 7.4.2.3.5 Media distribution function
The media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media
to call participants. By means of information provided by the MCPTT server
(e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following
functionality:
\- provide for the reception of uplink MCPTT UE media transmission by means of
the MCPTT-7 reference point;
\- replicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using
unicast transport;
\- distribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs by IP unicast transmission to those
participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCPTT-7 reference
point;
\- distribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs using multicast downlink transport
of media for the call by means of the MCPTT-8 reference point; and
\- provide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined
into a single media stream for transmission to the MCPTT UE.
NOTE 1: If media mixing function occurs within the media distribution
function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.
NOTE 2: A media mixing function within the media distribution function is not
possible where the media is end to end encrypted.
##### 7.4.2.3.6 Media mixer
This functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for combining
multiple media streams into one media stream through the enforcement of media
policy information.
##### 7.4.2.3.7 MCPTT user database
This functional entity contains information of the MCPTT user profile
associated with an MCPTT ID that is held by the MCPTT service provider at the

##### 7.4.3.1.3 SIP core
###### 7.4.3.1.3.1 General
The SIP core contains a number of sub-entities responsible for registration,
service selection and routing in the signalling control plane.
The SIP core shall be either:
1\. compliant with 3GPP TS 23.228 [5], i.e. the SIP core is a 3GPP IP
multimedia core network subsystem; or
2\. a SIP core, which internally need not comply with the architecture of 3GPP
TS 23.228 [5], but with the reference points that are defined in subclause
7.5.3 (if exposed), compliant to the reference points defined in 3GPP TS
23.002 [3].
The data related to the functions of the SIP core, e.g. for data for
application service selection, the identity of the serving registrar or
authentication related information may be provided by the PLMN operator
responsible for the bearer plane. In this case, the SIP database that is the
source of the data may be part of the HSS. Alternatively, this data may be
provided by the MCPTT service provider. In this case, the source of the data
may be the MCPTT service provider's SIP database.
###### 7.4.3.1.3.2 Local inbound / outbound proxy
The local inbound / outbound proxy functional entity acts as both an inbound
proxy and an outbound proxy for all SIP transactions. This functional entity
can provide the following functions:
\- NAT traversal;
\- Resource control;
\- Route/forward requests and responses to the user agents;
\- SIP signalling security; and

including E.164 numbers.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this functional entity is provided by the P-CSCF
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5].
###### 7.4.3.1.3.3 Registrar finder
The registrar finder functional entity is responsible for:
a) Identifying the serving registrar / application service selection
functional entity. The serving registrar / application service selection
functional entity is identified using information provided either by the PLMN
operator\'s own SIP database or the MCPTT service provider\'s SIP database,
and optionally using the PLMN operator\'s internal information e.g. network
topology, registrar availability.
1) Registrar finder and registrar in the MCPTT service provider domain:
registrar finder in the MCPTT service provider\'s domain uses the information
from the MCPTT service provider's SIP database to identify the serving
registrar in the MCPTT service provider domain.
2) Registrar finder and registrar in the PLMN operator domain: registrar
finder uses information from PLMN operator\'s SIP database to identify the
serving registrar in the PLMN operator domain.
3) Registrar finder in PLMN operator domain and registrar in MCPTT service
provider domain: registrar finder uses information from the MCPTT service
provider's SIP database to identify the serving registrar in the MCPTT service
provider domain.
NOTE 1: The need for the registrar finder is deployment specific e.g. a
deployment that has only one registrar does not need the registrar finder and
the related SIP database information.
b) Providing discovery and address resolution, including E.164 numbers.
NOTE 2: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the I-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [5].
###### 7.4.3.1.3.4 Registrar / application service selection
The registrar / application service selection functional entity provides the
following functions:
\- Registrar function (with integral provision of a location server) and also
acts as an inbound proxy (with access to the integral location server), and
outbound proxy for all SIP transactions where application service selection is
required. It registers the user and maintains the association of the location
and identity of the user in a location service. It provides notifications of
the registration states.
\- Supports authentication for identities provided within SIP signalling. Both
the registrar (with integral location server) and authentication functions are
supported by access either to the public network\'s own SIP database or the
MCPTT service provider\'s SIP database.
\- Can provide the application service selection for all SIP transactions,
possibly based on application service selection information stored by either
the public network\'s own SIP database or the MCPTT service provider\'s SIP
database.
\- Performs SIP signalling security.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the S-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [5].
#### 7.4.3.2 SIP database
##### 7.4.3.2.1 General
The SIP database contains information concerning the SIP subscriptions and
corresponding identity and authentication information required by the SIP
core, and such information as application service selection.
In deployment scenarios where the PLMN operator provides the SIP core, this
database is provided by the HSS.
In deployment scenarios where the MCPTT service provider provides the SIP
core, the SIP database may be provided by the MCPTT service provider.
Access to the data residing in the SIP database is restricted to the SIP core
entities that are specifically serving the subscriber/user whose data are
stored, i.e. registrars and registrar finders can access SIP databases only
when they are part of the same trust domain for the data being provided.
NOTE: The SIP database can be in a different network than the registrar finder
since the trust domain for the criteria for registrar selection can be
different than the trust domain for the signalling plane user identities.
The SIP database is responsible for storing the following user related
information:
\- signalling plane user identities: Numbering and addressing information;
\- signalling plane security information: SIP core access control information
for authentication and authorization;
\- MCPTT UE Location information at inter-system level: the SIP database
supports the user registration, and stores inter-system location information,
etc.; and
\- signalling plane subscription profile (including initial filter criteria).
The SIP database also generates signalling plane security information for
mutual authentication, communication integrity check and ciphering.
Based on this information, the SIP database is also responsible to support the
call control and session management entities of the SIP core.
The SIP database consists of the following functionalities:
\- support for control functions of the SIP core such as the Registrar and
Registrar finder. This is needed to enable subscriber usage of the SIP core
services. This functionality is independent of the access network used to
access the SIP core; and
\- authentication functionality required by the SIP core to authenticate the
MCPTT UE.
##### 7.4.3.2.2 SIP database logical functions
The SIP database provides the following logical functions:
a) mobility management;
\- provides the UE mobility through the SIP core.
b) registrar assignment support;
\- provides to the registrar finder the required capabilities for MCPTT
Services based on MCPTT service provider requirements on a per-user basis,
(e.g. whether a particular registrar within the PLMN operator's network (e.g.
a registrar reserved for MCPTT use or a registrar in a secure location) or a
registrar within the MCPTT service provider network is assigned.
c) call and/or session establishment support;
\- provides the call and/or session establishment procedures in the SIP core.
For terminating traffic, it provides information on which registrar currently
hosts the user.
d) user security information generation;
\- provides generation of user authentication, integrity and ciphering data
for the SIP core.
e) signalling plane security support;
\- provides authentication procedures to access MCPTT services by storing the
generated data for authentication, integrity and ciphering at the signalling
plane and by providing these data to the appropriate registrar.
f) user identification handling;
\- provides the appropriate relations among all the identifiers uniquely
determining the signalling plane identities in the SIP core e.g. IMS public
identities.
g) access authorisation; and
\- provides authorisation of the user for mobile access when requested by the
registrar e.g. by checking that the user is allowed to roam to that visited
network.
h) service authorisation support.
\- provides basic authorisation for terminating call/session establishment and
service invocation. The SIP database may update the registrar with filter
criteria to trigger the MCPTT Server.
#### 7.4.3.3 HTTP entities
##### 7.4.3.3.1 HTTP client
This functional entity acts as the client for all hypertext transactions.
##### 7.4.3.3.2 HTTP proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy for hypertext transactions between the
HTTP client and one or more HTTP servers. The HTTP proxy terminates a TLS
session on HTTP-1 with the HTTP client of the MCPTT UE allowing the HTTP
client to establish a single TLS session for hypertext transactions with
multiple HTTP servers that are reachable by the HTTP proxy.
The HTTP proxy is not used as part of CSC-1 interface. CSC-1 is a direct HTTP
interface between the IdM client in the UE and the IdM server as specified in
3GPP TS 33.179 [13].
According to 3GPP TS 33.179 [13], either an HTTP proxy or a direct HTTP
interface is used between the key management server and the key management
client in the UE for CSC-8.
The HTTP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the HTTP clients and HTTP
servers that are located within an MCPTT service provider's network. There can
be multiple instances of an HTTP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.
NOTE: The number of instances of the HTTP proxy is deployment specific.
##### 7.4.3.3.3 HTTP server
This functional entity acts as the HTTP server for all hypertext transactions.
## 7.5 Reference points
### 7.5.1 General reference point principle

MCPTT-1 reference point may use the HTTP-1 and HTTP-2 reference points.
Reference point MCPTT-1 may also provide the MCPTT server with location
information with respect to multicast service availability for the MCPTT
client. The TMGI is communicated between the MCPTT server and the MCPTT client
using the MCPTT-1 reference point.
Information that is reported to the MCPTT server from the MCPTT client shall
be configurable at the application layer. This interface may include the area
where a UE is currently located, described as ECGI of the serving and
neighbouring cell(s), MBMS SAIs, MBSFN Area ID. This information comes from
the broadcast by the local cell, e.g. from SIB1 and SIB15 (see 3GPP TS 36.331
[14]) as decoded by the UE.
NOTE: This reference point includes the GC1 reference point as described in
3GPP TS 23.468 [10]. It is assumed that the MCPTT server is performing the
function of GCS AS. While 3GPP TS 23.468 [10] does not specify GC1 it does
include high level descriptions of certain interactions on GC1, including
those relating to the availability of multicast delivery for the application
client. The MCPTT-1 reference point fulfils the requirements of the GC1

distribution function of the MCPTT server to obtain unicast bearers with
appropriate QoS from the EPS. It utilises the Rx interface of the EPS
according to 3GPP TS 23.203 [4].
MCPTT-5 is not used when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator do
not have an operational agreement for QoS control to be provided directly from
the MCPTT service provider domain.
MCPTT-5 may be used when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator have
an operational agreement where QoS control is provided directly from the MCPTT
service provider domain.
NOTE: Any coordination between the P-CSCF use of Rx and the MCPTT server use
of Rx (via MCPTT-5) from the MCPTT service provider domain is not specified in
this release of this specification.
#### 7.5.2.7 Reference point MCPTT-6 (between the MCPTT server and the EPS)

EPS, is used to request the allocation and activation of multicast transport
resources for MCPTT application usage. The MCPTT-6 reference point uses the
MB2-C interface as defined in 3GPP TS 29.468 [12].
#### 7.5.2.8 Reference point MCPTT-7 (unicast between the media distribution
function and the media mixer)
The MCPTT-7 reference point, which exists between the media distribution
function and the media mixer, is used to exchange unicast media between the
media distribution function of the MCPTT server and the media mixer of the
MCPTT client. The MCPTT-7 reference point uses the SGi reference point defined
in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3].
#### 7.5.2.9 Reference point MCPTT-8 (multicast between the media distribution
function and the media mixer)

#### 7.5.2.11 Reference point CSC-1 (between the identity management client
and the identity management server)
The CSC-1 reference point, which exists between the identity management client
and the identity management server, provides for the authentication of the
common services core to the MCPTT client and subsequent authentication of the
user to the common services core on behalf of applications within the
application plane.
CSC-1 is specified in 3GPP TS 33.179 [13].
#### 7.5.2.12 Reference point CSC-2 (between the group management client and
the group management server for configuration while UE is on-network)

subscription/notification related signalling. The CSC-7 reference point shall
use SIP-2 and SIP-3 reference points for transport and routing of
subscription/notification related signalling.
#### 7.5.2.18 Reference point CSC-8 (between the key management server and the
key management client)
The CSC-8 reference point, which exists between the key management server and
the key management client, provides a means for the key management server to

transport and routing of security related information to the group management
server and MCPTT server.
CSC-9 is specified in 3GPP TS 33.179 [13].
#### 7.5.2.20 Reference point CSC-10 (between the key management server and
the group management server)
The CSC-10 reference point, which exists between the key management server and
the group management server, provides a means for the key management server to
provide security related information (e.g. encryption keys) to the group
management server.
The CSC-10 reference point shall use the HTTP-1 and HTTP-2 reference points
and may use the HTTP-3 reference point for transport and routing of security

#### 7.5.2.21 Reference point CSC-11 (between the configuration management
client and the configuration management server for configuration while UE is
off-network)
The CSC-11 reference point, which exists between the configuration management
client and the configuration management server, provides the configuration
information required for MCPTT services while the MCPTT client is off-network.
The CSC-11 reference point is the same as CSC-4 reference point except that
CSC-11 does not support subscription/notification and therefore does not
require the use of SIP-1 and SIP-2 reference points.
#### 7.5.2.22 Reference point CSC-12 (between the group management client and
the group management server for configuration while UE is off-network)
The CSC-12 reference point, which exists between the group management client
and the group management server, is used for MCPTT application signalling for
MCPTT data management of the MCPTT service.
The CSC-12 reference point is the same as CSC-2 reference point except that

require the use of SIP-1 and SIP-2 reference points.
#### 7.5.2.23 Reference point CSC-13 (between the configuration management
server and the MCPTT user database)
The CSC-13 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT user database and
the configuration management server, is used for:

MCPTT user database for further configuration in the MCPTT UE.
#### 7.5.2.24 Reference point IWF-1 (between the MCPTT server and the
interworking function to legacy systems)
The IWF-1 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the
interworking function to legacy systems, is not specified in the present
document.
NOTE: A subset of the functionality provided by the existing MCPTT reference
points could be used to interconnect with legacy systems.
### 7.5.3 Signalling control plane
#### 7.5.3.1 General
The reference points for the SIP and HTTP signalling are described in the
following subclauses.
#### 7.5.3.2 Reference point SIP-1(between the signalling user agent and the
SIP core)
The SIP-1 reference point, which exists between the signalling user agent and
the SIP core for establishing a session in support of MCPTT, shall use the Gm
reference point as defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3] (with necessary enhancements
to support MCPTT requirements and profiled to meet the minimum requirements
for support of MCPTT). The SIP-1 reference point fulfils the requirements of
the GC1 reference point specified in3GPP TS 23.468 [10]. The SIP-1 reference
point is used for:
\- SIP registration;
\- authentication and security to the service layer;
\- event subscription and notification;
\- communication of the TMGI for multicast operation;
\- overload control; and
\- session management and media negotiation.
#### 7.5.3.3 Reference point SIP-2 (between the SIP core and the SIP AS)
The SIP-2 reference point, which exists between the SIP core and the SIP AS
for establishing a session in support of MCPTT, shall use the ISC and Ma
reference points as defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3]. The SIP-2 reference point
is used for:
\- notification to the MCPTT server of SIP registration by the MCPTT UE;
\- authentication and security to the service layer;
\- event subscription and notification;
\- communication of the TMGI for multicast operation; and
\- session management and media negotiation.
#### 7.5.3.4 Reference point SIP-3 (between the SIP core and SIP core)
The SIP-3 reference point, which exists between one SIP core and another SIP
core for establishing a session in support of MCPTT, shall use the Mm and ICi
reference points as defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3]. The SIP-3 reference point
is used for:
\- event subscription and notification; and
\- session management and media negotiation.
#### 7.5.3.5 Reference point HTTP-1 (between the HTTP client and the HTTP
proxy)
The HTTP-1 reference point exists between the HTTP client and the HTTP proxy.
Between the MCPTT UE and the HTTP proxy, the HTTP-1 reference point shall use
the Ut reference point as defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3] (with necessary
enhancements to support MCPTT requirements). The HTTP-1 reference point is
based on HTTP (which may be secured using e.g. SSL, TLS).
#### 7.5.3.6 Reference point HTTP-2 (between the HTTP proxy and the HTTP
server)
The HTTP-2 reference point, which exists between the HTTP proxy and the HTTP
server, is based on HTTP (which may be secured using e.g. SSL, TLS).
#### 7.5.3.7 Reference point HTTP-3 (between the HTTP proxy and HTTP proxy)
The HTTP-3 reference point, which exists between the HTTP proxy and another
HTTP proxy in a different network, is based on HTTP (which may be secured
using e.g. SSL, TLS).
#### 7.5.3.8 Reference point AAA-1 (between the SIP database and the SIP core)
The AAA-1 reference point, which exists between the SIP database and the SIP
core, is used by the SIP core to retrieve signalling plane data from the SIP
database. The AAA-1 reference point utilises the Cx reference point as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3].
In some deployment scenarios the registrar and SIP database are located in the
MCPTT service provider\'s network while the registrar finder is in the PLMN
operator\'s network and the AAA-1 reference point is an inter-network
interface.
# 8 Identities
## 8.1 Application plane
### 8.1.1 Mission Critical user identity (MC ID)
The mission critical user identity is also known as the MC ID. The MC ID is
the identity that an MCPTT user presents to the identity management server
during a user authentication transaction. In general, since identity
management is a common service it uses an identity which is linked to a set of
credentials (e.g. biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not
necessarily be tied to a single mission critical service. The MC ID and the
MCPTT ID may be the same. The MC ID uniquely identifies the MCPTT user to the
identity management server. The MC ID is used by the identity management
server to provide the identity management client a means for mission critical
service authentication.
NOTE: The specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to
use the MC user identity is specified in 3GPP TS 33.179 [13].
### 8.1.2 MCPTT user identity (MCPTT ID)
The MCPTT user identity is also known as the MCPTT ID. The MCPTT ID is a
globally unique identifier within the MCPTT service that represents the MCPTT
user. The MCPTT ID identifies an MCPTT user. The MCPTT ID may also identify an
MCPTT user profile for the user at the MCPTT application layer.
There are attributes associated with the MCPTT ID configured in the MCPTT
service that relate to the human user of the MCPTT service. Typically this
information identifies the MCPTT user, by name or role, and may also identify
a user\'s organization or agency. Such attributes associated with an MCPTT ID
can be used by the MCPTT server to make authorization decisions about the
MCPTT service granted to the user. For example, an attribute that identifies a
user\'s role as an incident commander could automatically be used by the MCPTT
service to grant the user additional administrative rights over the creation
of groups, or access to privileged talk groups.
The MCPTT ID shall be a URI. The MCPTT ID uniquely identifies an MCPTT user in
an MCPTT system. The MCPTT ID indicates the MCPTT system where the MCPTT ID is
defined.
When required by the MCPTT service provider, the MCPTT ID is hidden from the
signalling control plane.
A default or temporary MCPTT ID may be used where a user is not yet associated
with a device. When a user would like to use MCPTT services but has not been
authenticated by the identity management server, a default or temporary MCPTT
ID and a corresponding MCPTT user profile may be used.
### 8.1.3 MCPTT group identity (MCPTT group ID)
#### 8.1.3.1 General
The MCPTT group identity is also known as the MCPTT group ID. The MCPTT group
ID is a globally unique identifier within the MCPTT service that represents a
set of MCPTT users. The set of MCPTT users may belong to the same or different
MCPTT systems. The MCPTT system for each user (within the group) is identified
by each user\'s respective MCPTT ID.
The MCPTT group ID identifies an MCPTT group in an MCPTT system. It indicates
both the MCPTT system where the MCPTT group is defined, and the MCPTT server
within the MCPTT system where the group is defined.
The MCPTT group ID is used as follows:
a) For identifying a set of identities of its group members; and
b) By the MCPTT client to address the MCPTT group.
The MCPTT group ID shall be a URI.
When required by the MCPTT service provider, the MCPTT group ID is hidden from
the signalling control plane.
#### 8.1.3.2 MCPTT group ID management (off-network operation)
In off-network operation, an MCPTT group ID is used for identifying the MCPTT
group while off-network. The MCPTT group ID should be resolved to the ProSe
Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for the group
communication. The MCPTT UE is able to make communication with other member
UEs whose users are of the same MCPTT group ID over ProSe direct
communications based on ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and ProSe Group IP multicast
address, and utilising IPv4 or IPv6 as indicated by policy, as described in
3GPP TS 3GPP 23.303 [8].
Figure 8.1.3.2-1 illustrates how the MCPTT group ID, ProSe Group IP multicast
address and the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are mapped to each other. ProSe Group
IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in
accordance with the MCPTT group ID. Thus, they are pre-defined and associated.
This mapping information should be provisioned through UICC in the UE or
through ProSe function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [8], or be delivered
from an application server. Mapping information is provisioned from group
management server for online configuration, and provisioned from configuration
management server for offline configuration.
NOTE: To define the retrieval mechanism of the off-network information (ProSe
Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID) from ProSe function to
group management server is out of scope of the present document.
Figure 8.1.3.2-1: MCPTT group ID management in off-network operation
## 8.2 SIP signalling control plane
The SIP signalling control plane depends upon the use of both a private user
identity and one or more public user identities.
When the signalling user agent sends registration requests to the registrar /
application service selection, the private user identity is used to find
corresponding credentials for authentication of the signalling user agent by
the registrar / application service selection. This private user identity
fulfils the same functions as the IMPI defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5].
All SIP signalling messages sent by a signalling user agent to an MCPTT server
via a SIP core use a public user identity as the identifier to enable
signalling messages to be routed through the SIP system. The public user
identity fulfils the same functions as IMPU defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5].
NOTE 1: The relationship between the private user identity and public user
identity is defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5].
The public user identities do not necessarily contain any MCPTT application-
level attributes (e.g., MCPTT ID). Any association of the public user
identities with such attributes occurs at the application layer only.
When the SIP core and the MCPTT service are part of the same trust domain,
public user identities may be provided by the MCPTT service provider, or the
PLMN operator. When the SIP core and the MCPTT service are part of the
different trust domains, public user identities may be provided by the PLMN
operator.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT service provider can have an agreement with the PLMN
operator to manage a pool of public user identities.
The SIP core may generate public GRUUs and temporary GRUUs in order to
uniquely identify MCPTT UEs when a user logging on from multiple devices or
multiple users sharing the same device is supported per 3GPP TS 23.228 [5].
Public service identity is used as the identifier to route SIP signalling for
the MCPTT system. The public service identity fulfils the same functions as
PSI defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5].
## 8.3 Relationship between identities in different planes
### 8.3.1 Relationship between MCPTT ID and public user identity
The following relationships exist between the MCPTT ID(s) and the public user
identity(ies):
\- An MCPTT ID may be mapped to one or more public user identities (e.g.
multiple UEs, shared UE);
\- A public user identity may be mapped to one or more MCPTT IDs (e.g. UE-to-
network relay); and
\- An MCPTT ID may be mapped to one or more public GRUUs (e.g. a user logging
on from multiple UEs, multiple users sharing the same UE).
The MCPTT server manages the mapping between MCPTT IDs and public user
identities.
The MCPTT server manages the mapping between MCPTT IDs and public GRUUs.
Temporary GRUUs are mapped to public GRUUs by the SIP core.
The public user identity does not necessarily identify the MCPTT user at the
SIP signalling control plane. When the MCPTT service provider and the home
PLMN operator are part of the same trust domain, the public user identity in
the SIP signalling control plane may also identify the MCPTT user at the
application plane.
### 8.3.2 Relationship between MCPTT group ID and public service identity
Each MCPTT group ID shall be mapped to a public service identity for the MCPTT
server where the group is defined. The MCPTT server manages the mapping
between MCPTT group IDs and public service identities.
When the MCPTT service provider and the home PLMN operator are part of the
same trust domain, the public service identity in the SIP signalling control
plane may also identify the MCPTT group ID at the application plane.

# 9 Application of functional model to deployments
## 9.1 General
This clause describes the application of the functional model, described in
clause 7, to on-network and off-network deployments. It also describes
deployment scenarios that highlight some of the possible variations in the way
that the functional model can be applied in different situations.
## 9.2 Architecture model and deployment scenarios for on-network operations
### 9.2.1 On-network architectural model
#### 9.2.1.1 On-network architectural model diagram
Figure 9.2.1.1-1 below is the on-network architectural model for the MCPTT
system solution, where the MCPTT system provides MCPTT service via a single
PLMN.
Figure 9.2.1.1-1: On-network architectural model
#### 9.2.1.2 Application services layer
##### 9.2.1.2.1 Overview
The application services layer includes MCPTT application and any required
supporting functions grouped into common services core.
##### 9.2.1.2.2 Common services core
Common services core is composed of the following functional entities:
\- for common services, a configuration management server as described in
subclause 7.4.2.2.2, a group management server as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.4, an identity management server as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.6
and a key management server as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.8; and
\- for signalling control, an HTTP proxy as described in subclause 7.4.3.3.2
and an HTTP server as described in subclause 7.4.3.3.3.
##### 9.2.1.2.3 MCPTT application service
MCPTT application service is composed of the following functional entities:
\- an MCPTT server as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.2; and
\- for media, a floor control server as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.4 and a
media distribution function as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.5.
#### 9.2.1.3 SIP core
The SIP core provides rendezvous (contact address binding and URI resolution)
and service control (application service selection) functions. It is composed
of the following functional entities:
\- for signalling control, a local inbound / outbound proxy as described in
subclause 7.4.3.1.3.2, a registrar finder as described in subclause
7.4.3.1.3.3 and a registrar / application service selection entity as
described in subclause 7.4.3.1.3.4.
#### 9.2.1.4 EPS
The EPS provides point-to-point and point-to-multipoint bearer services with
QoS.
#### 9.2.1.5 UE 1
UE 1 is:
\- an MCPTT UE in on-network mode supporting bearer services and
application(s) related to MCPTT;
\- an MCPTT UE that acts as ProSe UE-to-network relay; or
\- both of the above.
When acting as an MCPTT UE in on-network mode supporting bearer services and
application(s) related to MCPTT, UE 1 is composed of the same functional
entities as for UE 2, as described in subclause 9.2.1.6, without the support
of ProSe capabilities.
#### 9.2.1.6 UE 2
UE 2 is a device using ProSe UE-to-network relay, and supporting

7.4.2.2.3, a configuration management client as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.1, an identity management client as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.5
and a key management client as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.7;
\- for MCPTT application services, an MCPTT client as described in subclause
7.4.2.3.1;
\- for signalling control, a signalling user agent as described in subclause
7.4.3.1.1 and an HTTP client as described in subclause 7.4.3.3.1; and
\- for media, a floor participant as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.3.
### 9.2.2 Deployment scenarios
#### 9.2.2.1 Administration of MCPTT application service, SIP core and EPS
##### 9.2.2.1.1 General
This subclause describes five different deployment scenarios in which
different administration of MCPTT application service, SIP core and EPS are
described, together with the sensitivities of identities and other forms of
signalling in those scenarios.
In each of these scenarios, the owner of the devices at each plane may be
different from the organisation that administers these devices. For example,
the MCPTT service provider may own some RAN components within the EPS even
when the EPS is administered by the PLMN operator, and the MCPTT UE may be
owned by an organisation that is independent from PLMN and MCPTT service
providers.
##### 9.2.2.1.2 Common administration of all planes
In this scenario, all planes (application services layer, SIP core and EPS)
are administered by the same party. This is illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.2-1
below.
Figure 9.2.2.1.2-1: Common administration of all services by one operator
Although the identities in each plane are separate according to clause 8,
there is no particular sensitivity of identities and other information at the
application plane, and these may be exposed to the SIP core and the EPS.
All authorisation and authentication mechanisms at each plane, i.e. the
application services layer, SIP core and EPS, shall be separate, but there may
be no need for any restrictions in how these are stored and managed; for
example the same entity could provide services to each of the application
services layer, SIP core and EPS.
##### 9.2.2.1.3 MCPTT service provider separate from SIP core and EPS
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.3-1, the MCPTT service
provider is separate and independent from the PLMN operator, and the MCPTT
service is administered independently of the EPS and SIP core. The PLMN
operator administers the EPS and the SIP core.
Figure 9.2.2.1.3-1: MCPTT service provider administers MCPTT service
separately from SIP core and EPS
The MCPTT service provider may require that all application services layer
identities and other sensitive information are hidden both from the SIP core
and the EPS.
When required by the MCPTT service provider, all authentication and
authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at the application
services layer are hidden from and not available to the PLMN operator.
##### 9.2.2.1.4 MCPTT service provider administers SIP core, separate from EPS
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.4-1, the MCPTT service
provider administers the SIP core, and the MCPTT application services and SIP
core are independent of the PLMN operator.
Figure 9.2.2.1.4-1: MCPTT service provider provision of SIP core, separate
domain from EPS
The MCPTT service provider may require that all identities and other sensitive
information at the application services layer are hidden from the EPS. The
MCPTT service provider need not hide the identities and signalling at the
application services layer from the SIP core. However the MCPTT service
provider may require that identities and other sensitive information between
SIP core and SIP client in the MCPTT UE are also hidden from the EPS.
All authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at
both application services layer and at SIP signalling plane may need to be
hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.
##### 9.2.2.1.5 SIP core partially administered by both PLMN operator and
MCPTT service provider
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.5-1, the SIP core is
partially administered by both parties, for example when the SIP core
registrar is administered by the MCPTT service provider, but the SIP core
registrar finder and proxy is administered by the PLMN operator.
Figure 9.2.2.1.5-1: MCPTT service provider partial provision of SIP core,
separate domain from EPS
The MCPTT service provider may require that all identities and signalling at
the application services layer are hidden from the EPS, and may require
identities and other sensitive information to be hidden from the PLMN operator
administered part of the SIP core.
All authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at
the application services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available
to, the PLMN operator.
##### 9.2.2.1.6 PLMN operator administers SIP core with SIP identities
administered by MCPTT service provider
In this scenario, the PLMN operator administers the SIP core. However, the
identities used by the SIP core (IMPI and IMPU) for MCPTT UEs served by the
MCPTT service provider are provided from the SIP database of the MCPTT service
provider.
Figure 9.2.2.1.6-1: MCPTT service provider provides identities to PLMN
operator SIP core
The MCPTT service provider may require that all identities and signalling at
the application services layer are hidden from the SIP core and EPS.
When required by the MCPTT service provider, all authentication and
authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at the application
services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN
operator.
The security roots (authentication keys) required for access to the signalling
control plane are not available to the PLMN operator as these are held in the
MCPTT service provider\'s SIP database. However, derived parameters e.g.
authentication vectors are provided to the SIP core to allow signalling
control plane authentication to take place.
#### 9.2.2.2 MCPTT user database, SIP database and HSS
Figures 9.2.2.2-1 to 9.2.2.2-4 show the possible deployment scenarios of the
MCPTT user database and SIP database, including collocation with the HSS.
The MCPTT user database may be combined with an HSS in some deployment
scenarios (e.g. when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator are part
of the same trust domain).
The MCPTT user database may be a user data repository (UDR) in deployment
scenarios when the UDC architecture is applied (see 3GPP TS 23.335 [16]), in
that case the MCPTT Server and the configuration management server are assumed
to be application front-ends and the Ud interface is used to access data from
the repository.
NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the SIP database can be located within
the SIP core, in which case the AAA‑1 interface is not exposed.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT user database and the MCPTT server are always deployed in
the same network i.e. both in the PLMN operator\'s network or both in the
MCPTT service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-1: Collocation of MCPTT user database and SIP database with HSS
The HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-1 can be deployed either in the PLMN
operator\'s network or the MCPTT service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-2: Shared PLMN operator and MCPTT service provider based
deployment of MCPTT service - SIP database collocated with HSS with separate
MCPTT user database
The MCPTT user database depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-2 can be deployed in the
PLMN operator\'s network or the MCPTT service provider\'s network, and the HSS
depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-2 can be deployed in the same or different network
to the MCPTT user database i.e. PLMN operator\'s network or the MCPTT service
provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-3: Shared PLMN operator and MCPTT service provider based
deployment of MCPTT service - MCPTT user database and SIP database deployed
together, with separate HSS
The MCPTT user database and SIP database depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-3 can be
deployed in the PLMN operator\'s network or the MCPTT service provider\'s
network, and the HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-3 can be deployed in the same
or different network to the MCPTT user database i.e. PLMN operator\'s network
or the MCPTT service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-4: Shared PLMN operator and MCPTT service provider based
deployment of MCPTT service - separate HSS, MCPTT user database and SIP
database
Each of the MCPTT user database, SIP database and HSS depicted in figure
9.2.2.2-4 can be deployed in the same or different networks i.e. PLMN
operator\'s network or the MCPTT service provider\'s network.
#### 9.2.2.3 Control of bearers by SIP core and MCPTT server
##### 9.2.2.3.1 General
This subclause describes two different scenarios in which bearers are
controlled by access to Rx by either the SIP core or the MCPTT server.
These may provide suitable models for each of the scenarios listed in
subclause 9.2.2.1. However, there is no direct correlation of any of the
scenarios described in this subclause to each of the scenarios described in
subclause 9.2.2.1.
##### 9.2.2.3.2 Control of bearers by SIP core
In this scenario, bearer control is performed by the SIP core alone, as shown
in figure 9.2.2.3.2-1 below.
Figure 9.2.2.3.2-1: Bearer control by SIP core
##### 9.2.2.3.3 Control of bearers by MCPTT server
In this scenario, bearer control is performed by the MCPTT server alone, as
shown in figure 9.2.2.3.3-1 below.
Figure 9.2.2.3.3-1: Bearer control by MCPTT server
## 9.3 Architecture model for off-network operations
### 9.3.1 Off-network architectural model diagram
Figure 9.3.1-1 shows the off-network architectural model for the MCPTT system
solution for inter-UE communication, where no relay function is used.
Figure 9.3.1-1: Off-network architectural model for inter-UE communication
where no relay function is used
Figure 9.3.1-2 shows the off-network architectural model for the MCPTT system
solution for configuration management and group management.
Figure 9.3.1-2: Off-network architectural model for configuration management
and group management
NOTE 1: The offline common services server denoted in figure 9.3.1-2 could be
provided by a portable device e.g. laptop.
NOTE 2: Non-EPS access can be any IP-CAN that is mutually supported by the
offline common services server and the UE 3, and which provides necessary
connectivity for the CSC-11 and CSC-12 reference points. It is out of scope of
this specification what type of IP-CANs are supported, but could be e.g. USB,
Bluetooth, WLAN.
The offline common services server could be the same entity (or set of
entities) as the common services core. In this case the configuration
management server shall not configure to the same user on the same UE, with

# 10 Procedures and information flows
## 10.1 MCPTT configuration
### 10.1.1 General
Depicted in figure 10.1.1-1 is a MCPTT configuration time sequence of the data
in Annex B, representing the general lifecycle of MCPTT UE using MCPTT
service.
Figure 10.1.1-1 MCPTT UE configuration time sequence and associated
configuration data
The MCPTT UE is provided with initial UE configuration via a bootstrap
procedure that provides the MCPTT UE\'s clients (e.g. MCPTT client, group
management client, configuration management client, identity management
client, key management client) with critical information needed to connect to
the MCPTT system. This includes PDN connection information (see subclause
5.2.9.1) and on-network server identity information for all application plane
servers with which the MCPTT UE needs to interact. See annex B.6 for more
information.
The MCPTT UE is provided with UE configuration, MCPTT user profile
configuration and group configuration via online configuration. While the
MCPTT UE is using the MCPTT service it may receive online configuration
updates. If the MCPTT user profile configuration contains multiple MCPTT user
profiles for an authenticated MCPTT user, then the MCPTT client and MCPTT
server set the active MCPTT user profile to the configured pre-selected MCPTT
user profile.
The MCPTT service is configured with the service configuration (not shown in
the figure 10.1.1-1) which the MCPTT service enforces during the entire phase
of MCPTT UE using the MCPTT service.

### 10.1.3 MCPTT UE configuration data
#### 10.1.3.1 General
The MCPTT UE configuration data has to be known by the MCPTT UE before it can
use the MCPTT service.
#### 10.1.3.2 Procedures
The procedure for MCPTT UE obtaining the MCPTT UE related configuration data
is illustrated in figure 10.1.3.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCPTT UE has the secure access to the configuration management server.
Figure 10.1.3.2-1: MCPTT UE obtains the configuration data
1\. The configuration management client sends a get MCPTT UE configuration
request to the configuration management server for obtaining MCPTT UE
configuration data.
2\. The configuration management server sends get MCPTT UE configuration
response to the configuration management client. This message carries the
MCPTT UE configuration data.
#### 10.1.3.3 Structure of UE configuration data
The MCPTT UE configuration data is listed in annex B.2.
### 10.1.4 MCPTT user profile
#### 10.1.4.1 General
An MCPTT user is identified by an MCPTT ID. An MCPTT ID is associated with at
least one MCPTT user profile and can be associated with multiple MCPTT user
profiles (identified by an index and optionally a profile name). This is
depicted in figure 10.1.4.1-1.
Figure 10.1.4.1-1: The relationship of MCPTT user, MCPTT ID, and MCPTT User
Profile
For the same MCPTT user there can be different MCPTT user profiles active on
different MCPTT UEs or different MCPTT user profiles active on the same MCPTT
UE at different times. Only one MCPTT user profile per MCPTT client is active
at a time.
All MCPTT user profiles associated with an MCPTT user are stored in the MCPTT
user database. Different parts of the MCPTT user profile are provisioned by
the Mission Critical Organization, by the MCPTT service provider and by the
MCPTT user, respectively.
MCPTT user profile information is downloaded to the MCPTT UE. The MCPTT user
profile provisioning in the UE is initiated by the configuration management
client (e.g. upon MCPTT user authentication or on reconnect to MCPTT service),
or initiated by the configuration management server (e.g. due to role change
or organization change). MCPTT user profile configuration may include more
than one information exchange e.g. the configuration management server may
provide the MCPTT UE with a list of some or all enabled MCPTT user profiles to
allow the MCPTT user to select one (where the list may contain a subset of the
MCPTT user profile information sufficient for the MCPTT user to distinguish
which MCPTT user profile to select).
Information contained in the MCPTT user profile is listed in annex B.3.

## 10.2 User authentication and authorization for MCPTT service
Flow 10.2-1 is a high level user authentication and authorization flow. 3GPP
TS 33.179 [13] defines the specific user authentication and authorization
architecture required by the MCPTT service in order to realize the MCPTT user
authentication and authorization requirements as defined in 3GPP TS 22.179
[2].
The user authentication process shown in flow 10.2-1 may take place in some
scenarios as a separate step independently from a SIP registration phase, for
example if the SIP core is outside the domain of the MCPTT server.
A procedure for user authentication is illustrated in figure 10.2-1. Other
alternatives may be possible, such as authenticating the user within the SIP
registration phase.
Figure 10.2-1: MCPTT user authentication and registration, single domain
1\. In this step the identity management client begins the user authorization
procedure. The MCPTT user supplies the user credentials (e.g. biometrics,
secureID, username/password) for verification with the identity management
server. This step may occur before or after step 3.
2\. The signalling user agent establishes a secure connection to the SIP core
for the purpose of SIP level authentication and registration.
3\. The signalling user agent completes the SIP level registration with the
SIP core (and an optional third-party registration with the MCPTT server).
4\. The MCPTT client performs the MCPTT service authorization for the user.
Step 4 utilizes the results of step 1.

system
##### 10.3.5.1.1 Authorized user remotely changes another MCPTT user\'s
affiliated MCPTT group(s) -- mandatory mode
Procedure for the authorized user to remotely change another MCPTT user\'s
affiliated MCPTT group(s) without requiring target user\'s approval is
described in figure 10.3.5.1.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCPTT client 1 (authorized user 1) has already been provisioned
(statically or dynamically) with the target MCPTT user\'s information and its
group information, that target MCPTT user 2 is allowed to be affiliated or de-
affiliated;
\- The primary MCPTT server may have retrieved the user/group policy e.g.
information regarding user(s) authorization to affiliate or to de-affiliate to
MCPTT group(s), priority, and other related configuration data.
Figure 10.3.5.1.1-1: Remotely change MCPTT group affiliation -- mandatory mode
1\. When an authorized user requires one or more MCPTT users to change the
affiliation to an MCPTT group or set of MCPTT groups, the MCPTT client 1 of
the authorized user 1 sends MCPTT group affiliation change request with the
indication of mandatory mode to the primary MCPTT server. The information used
to indicate the change of the affiliation relationship between the target
MCPTT user 2 and the MCPTT group(s) shall be included.
2\. The primary MCPTT server shall check if the MCPTT user 1 is authorized to
initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the target user 2
and the MCPTT group(s). The primary MCPTT server shall check if the target
MCPTT user(s) are authorized for the requested affiliation relationship based
on the user subscription. The primary MCPTT server also performs the check for
the maximum limit on the total number (N2) of MCPTT groups that the user can
be affiliated to simultaneously.
3a. The primary MCPTT server checks if the group policy is locally cached. If
the group policy is not locally cached on the MCPTT server, then, the MCPTT
server subscribes to the group policy from the group management server.
3b. The primary MCPTT server receives the group policy from the group
management server via notification and locally caches the group policy
information.
4\. Based on the group policy, the primary MCPTT server checks if the target
MCPTT user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate to the MCPTT group(s).
5\. If the target MCPTT user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate to
the MCPTT group(s) then the primary MCPTT server stores the new requested
affiliation status of the target MCPTT user 2 for the MCPTT group(s).
6\. If the requested affiliation status is a change from the current
affiliation status, then the primary MCPTT server updates the group management
server with the affiliation status of the MCPTT user 2 for the MCPTT group(s).
7a. If the requested affiliation status is a change the primary MCPTT server
sends the MCPTT group affiliation change request with the indication of
mandatory mode to MCPTT client 2 of the target MCPTT user 2\. The target MCPTT
user 2 receives the latest information about the affiliated MCPTT groups.
Further the MCPTT client 2 may subscribe for the affiliated MCPTT groups
information with the group management server.
7b. The MCPTT user 2 provides a response to the primary MCPTT server by
sending an MCPTT group affiliation change response.
8\. The primary MCPTT server sends the MCPTT group affiliation change response
to MCPTT client 1. If the requested affiliation status was not changed (see
7a), then the MCPTT server creates an appropriate (accept) MCPTT group
affiliation change response to send to MCPTT client 1.
NOTE: Steps 6, 7a, 7b and 8 can occur in any order or in parallel, with the
restriction that step 7b can only occur after step 7a occurred.
##### 10.3.5.1.2 Authorized user remotely changes another MCPTT user\'s
affiliated MCPTT group(s) -- negotiated mode
Procedure for the authorized user to remotely change another MCPTT user\'s
affiliated MCPTT group(s) with the target MCPTT user\'s approval is described
in figure 10.3.5.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCPTT client 1 (authorized user 1) has already been provisioned
(statically or dynamically) with target MCPTT user\'s information and its
group information, that target MCPTT user 2 is allowed to be affiliated or de-
affiliated;
\- The primary MCPTT server may have retrieved the user/group policy e.g.
information regarding user(s) authorization to affiliate or to de-affiliate to
MCPTT group(s), priority, and other related configuration data.
Figure 10.3.5.1.2-1: Remotely change MCPTT group affiliation -- negotiated
mode
1\. When an authorized user requires one or more MCPTT users to change the
affiliation to an MCPTT group or set of MCPTT groups, the MCPTT client 1 of
the authorized user 1 sends MCPTT group affiliation change request to the
primary MCPTT server. The information (i.e. target MCPTT user(s) ID, MCPTT
group(s) ID, Requested affiliation status) used to indicate the change of the
affiliation relationship between the target MCPTT user 2 and the MCPTT
group(s) shall be included.
2\. The primary MCPTT server shall check if the MCPTT user 1 is authorized to
initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the target user 2
and the MCPTT group(s). The primary MCPTT server shall check if the target
MCPTT user(s) are authorized for the requested affiliation relationship based
on the user subscription and the group policy (i.e. if not available, the
primary MCPTT server obtains the group policy from the group management
server). The primary MCPTT server also performs the check for the maximum
limit on the total number (N2) of MCPTT groups that the user can be affiliated
to simultaneously.
3\. If the target MCPTT user 2 is authorized to accept the changes to its
affiliated MCPTT group(s), the primary MCPTT server sends the MCPTT group
affiliation change request to the MCPTT client 2 of the target MCPTT user 2.
4\. If the requested affiliation status is different from the current
affiliation status , then the MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT group
affiliation change request to the target MCPTT user 2 to receive the approval
from the user on the proposed changes to the affiliated MCPTT group(s).
NOTE 1: The procedure is aborted if the target MCPTT user 2 does not respond
to the notification within an implementation dependent time.
5\. If the target MCPTT user 2 provides a response (accept or reject) to the
notification, then the MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT group affiliation change
response to the primary MCPTT server. A response indicating target user 2\'s
acceptance to the requested affiliation change by authorized user 1, triggers
the affiliation or de-affiliation procedures at the primary MCPTT server (see
subclause 10.3.3.1 or subclause 10.3.4.2) as per the MCPTT user 1\'s requested
changes to the target user 2\'s affiliated group(s).
NOTE 2: In the case where the affiliation changes for target user 2 includes
MCPTT groups defined in partner MCPTT systems, the primary MCPTT server
performs the affiliation or de-affiliation procedures by interacting with the
partner MCPTT systems (see subclause 10.3.3.2 or subclause 10.3.4.3).
6\. The primary MCPTT server sends the MCPTT group affiliation change response
to the MCPTT client 1. If the requested affiliation status was not changed
(see 4), then the MCPTT server creates an appropriate (accept) MCPTT group
affiliation change response to send to MCPTT client 1.
NOTE 3: If multiple MCPTT groups are included in step 1, and these MCPTT
groups belong to different partner MCPTT systems, the primary MCPTT server can
wait until all the partner MCPTT systems provides the MCPTT group affiliation
change response messages.
#### 10.3.5.2 Remote change of affiliation for groups defined in partner MCPTT
system

(statically or dynamically) with the target MCPTT user 2\'s information and
group information, that the target MCPTT user 2 is allowed to be affiliated or
de-affiliated;
\- The MCPTT client 1 (authorized user 1), MCPTT client 2 (target MCPTT user
2), and the primary MCPTT server belong to the same MCPTT system;
\- The partner MCPTT server may have retrieved the group related information
from the group management server; and
\- The primary MCPTT server may have retrieved the user policy e.g. user
related information regarding user(s) authorization to affiliate or to de-
affiliate to MCPTT group(s), priority, and other related configuration data.
Figure 10.3.5.2.1-1: Remote change MCPTT group affiliation defined in partner
MCPTT system -- mandatory mode
1\. When an authorized user requires one or more MCPTT users to change the
affiliation to an MCPTT group or set of MCPTT groups, the MCPTT client 1 of
the authorized user 1 sends MCPTT group affiliation change request with the
indication of mandatory mode to the primary MCPTT server. The information
(i.e. target MCPTT user(s) ID, MCPTT group(s) ID, Requested affiliation
status) used to indicate the change of the affiliation relationship between
the target MCPTT user 2 and the MCPTT group(s) shall be included.
2\. The primary MCPTT server shall check if the MCPTT user 1 is authorized to
initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the target user 2
and the MCPTT group(s). The primary MCPTT server shall check if the target
MCPTT user(s) are authorized for the requested affiliation relationship based
on the user subscription. The primary MCPTT server also performs the check for
the maximum limit on the total number (N2) of MCPTT groups that the user can
be affiliated to simultaneously.
3\. Based on the MCPTT group information included in the request, the primary
MCPTT server determines to send MCPTT group affiliation change request to the
corresponding partner MCPTT server (group host server).
4a. The partner MCPTT server checks if the group policy is locally cached. If
the group policy is not locally cached on the partner MCPTT server then the
partner MCPTT server subscribes to the group policy from the group management
server.
4b. The partner MCPTT server receives the group policy from the group
management server via notification and locally caches the group policy
information.
5\. Based on the group policy, the partner MCPTT server checks if the target
MCPTT user 2 is authorized to affiliate to the MCPTT group(s). It is possible
that the target MCPTT user 2 affiliates to one or several MCPTT groups and
also de-affiliates from one or more MCPTT groups.
6\. If the target MCPTT user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate to
the MCPTT group(s) and if the requested affiliation status is different to the
current affiliation status, then the partner MCPTT server stores the new
affiliation status of the target MCPTT user 2 for the MCPTT group(s).
7\. The partner MCPTT server updates the group management server with the
affiliation status of the target MCPTT user 2 for the MCPTT group(s).
8\. The partner MCPTT server sends the MCPTT group affiliation change response
to the primary MCPTT server.
NOTE: Steps 7 and 8 can occur in any order or in parallel.
9\. If the requested affiliation status is different to the current
affiliation status, then the primary MCPTT server stores the new affiliation
status of the target MCPTT user 2 for the MCPTT group(s).
10a. If the requested affiliation status is different to the current
affiliation status, then the primary MCPTT server sends the MCPTT group
affiliation change request with the indication of mandatory mode to MCPTT
client 2 of the target MCPTT user 2. The target MCPTT user 2 receives the
latest information about the affiliated MCPTT groups. Further the MCPTT client
2 may subscribe for the affiliated MCPTT groups information with the group
management server.
10b. The target MCPTT client 2 provides an MCPTT group affiliation change
response to the MCPTT server.
11\. The primary MCPTT server sends the MCPTT group affiliation change
response to MCPTT client 1 (authorized user). If the requested affiliation
status was not changed (see 10a), then the MCPTT server creates an appropriate
(accept) MCPTT group affiliation change response to send to MCPTT client 1.
## 10.4 Group management (on-network)
### 10.4.1 General
Group management procedures apply to on-network MCPTT service only.
Group creation provides a dedicated MCPTT group to individual MCPTT users to
enable the required communication. This includes the normal group creation by
administrators as well as user regrouping by authorized user/dispatcher.
Group regrouping enables dispatchers or authorized users to temporarily
combine different MCPTT groups.
NOTE 1: If an authorized MCPTT user wants to participate in a new group
created by the authorized MCPTT user, then the authorized MCPTT user needs to
have been included in the new group as a member and have affiliated to the new
group.
NOTE 2: If an authorized MCPTT user wants to participate in a temporary group
created by a group regroup operation performed by this authorized MCPTT user,
then the authorized MCPTT user needs to have been an existing member of and
affiliated to at least one of the constituent groups that was part of the
associated group regroup operation and have affiliated to the new temporary
group.

MCPTT user requests group create operation to the group management server. The
identities of the users being combined shall be included in this message.
2\. During the group creation, the group management server creates and stores
the information of the group as group configuration data as described in
subclause 10.1.5.4. The group management server performs the check on the
maximum limit of the total number (N11) of MCPTT group members for the MCPTT
group(s).
3\. The group management server may conditionally notify the MCPTT server
regarding the group creation with the information of the group members. During
user regroup, the group management server notifies the MCPTT server regarding
the group creation with the information of the temporary group members. The
MCPTT users of the temporary group may be automatically affiliated, if
configured on the MCPTT server.
4\. The MCPTT group members of the MCPTT group are notified about the newly
created MCPTT group configuration data.
5\. The group management server provides a group creation confirmation
response to the group management client of the
administrator/dispatcher/authorized MCPTT user.
### 10.4.4 Group regrouping
#### 10.4.4.1 Temporary group formation - group regrouping within an MCPTT
system
Figure 10.4.4.1-1 below illustrates the group regroup operations to create a
temporary group within an MCPTT system. For simplicity, only the case of two
MCPTT groups being combined is represented, but the procedure is the same if
more than two groups are combined.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client, group management server, MCPTT server and the
MCPTT group members belong to the same MCPTT system.
Figure 10.4.4.1-1: Group regroup for the groups within the same MCPTT system
1\. The group management client of the MCPTT user requests group regroup
operation to the group management server, where the groups being combined are
within the same MCPTT system. The identities of the groups being combined
shall be included in this message. The group management client may indicate
the security level required for the temporary group. The group management
client may indicate the priority level required for the temporary group.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MCPTT user, based on group policy. The group
management server checks whether group1 or group2 is a temporary group. If
group 1 or group2 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be
rejected, otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary MCPTT group ID, the MCPTT group ID of
the groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary group and the
security level of the temporary group. If the authorized MCPTT user does not
specify the security level and the priority level, the group management server
shall set the lowest security level and the highest priority of the
constituent groups.
4\. The group management server notifies the MCPTT server regarding the
temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups, i.e.
temporary MCPTT group ID, group1\'s MCPTT group ID and group2\'s MCPTT group
ID.
5\. The group management server notifies the affiliated MCPTT group members of
the constituent MCPTT groups, possibly with an indication of lower security
level.
6\. The group management server provides a group regroup confirmation response
to the group management client of the authorized MCPTT user.
#### 10.4.4.2 Temporary group formation involving multiple MCPTT systems
Figure 10.4.4.2-1 below illustrates the group regroup operations to create a
temporary group involving multiple MCPTT systems. For simplicity, only the
case of two MCPTT groups being combined is represented, but the procedure is
the same if more than two groups are combined.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share their users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The primary MCPTT system consists of the group management server 1 and
MCPTT server (primary). The partner MCPTT system consists of the group
management server 2 and MCPTT server (partner).
3\. The group management client of the authorized MCPTT user belongs to the
primary MCPTT system.
Figure 10.4.4.2-1: Temporary group formation - group regrouping involving
multiple MCPTT systems
1\. The group management client of the MCPTT user (e.g. dispatcher) requests
group regroup operation to the group management server 1 (which is the group
management server of the authorized MCPTT user). The identities of the groups
being combined shall be included in this message. The group management client
may indicate the security level required for the temporary group. The group
management client may indicate the priority level required for the temporary
group.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MCPTT user, based on group policy. The group
management server 1 checks whether group1 is a temporary group. If group1 is a
temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected, otherwise the
group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server 1 forwards the group regroup request to the
target group management server 2 with the information of the group management
server 2 MCPTT groups.
4\. The group management server 2 checks whether group2 is a temporary group.
If group2 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected,
otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.
5\. The group management server 2 provides a group regroup response. Due to
security aspects concerning sharing information among different MCPTT systems,
the group management server 2 does not share the users\' information of the
groups under its management to the group management server 1.
NOTE: If there is a trust relationship between the primary MCPTT service
provider and the partner service provider, the partner MCPTT system can share
their users\' information to the primary MCPTT system at this step. If there
is a change in partner MCPTT system's constituent group membership, the
synchronization procedure with the primary MCPTT system for temporary group is
out of scope of this specification
6\. The group management server 1 creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary MCPTT group ID, off-network
information, and the MCPTT IDs of the groups being combined, the priority
level of the temporary group, and the security level of the temporary group.
If the authorized MCPTT user does not specify the security level and the
priority level, the group management server shall set the lower security level
and the higher priority of the constituent groups.
7\. The group management server 1 notifies the group management server 2 about
its group regroup operation.
8\. The group management server 2 acknowledges the group management server 1
and the group management server 2 also stores the information about the
temporary group including the temporary MCPTT group ID, the MCPTT group IDs of
the groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary group and the
security level of the temporary group.
9\. The group management server 2 notifies the partner MCPTT server regarding
the temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups
i.e. temporary MCPTT group ID, group1\'s MCPTT group ID and group2\'s MCPTT
group ID.
10\. Partner MCPTT server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server 2.
11\. The group management server 2 notifies the affiliated MCPTT group members
of the constituent MCPTT groups of the group management server 2, possibly
with an indication of a lower security level.
12\. The group management server 1 notifies the MCPTT server of the primary
system regarding the temporary group creation with the information of the
constituent groups, i.e. temporary MCPTT group ID, group1\'s MCPTT group ID
and group2\'s MCPTT group ID. If there are active calls to be merged then the
group management server 1 includes an indication to merge active calls.
13\. Primary MCPTT server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server 1.
14\. The group management server 1 notifies the affiliated MCPTT group members
of the constituent MCPTT groups of the group management server 1, possibly
with an indication of lower security level.
15\. The group management server 1 provides a group regroup confirmation
response to the group management client of the authorized MCPTT user (e.g.
dispatcher).
#### 10.4.4.3 Temporary group tear down involving multiple group host servers
Figure 10.4.4.3-1 below illustrates the tearing down procedure of temporary
group created through the group regroup. The procedure can be used when, e.g.,
the specific task for which the temporary group was created has been completed
or a busier period occurs. For simplicity, only the teardown case for a
temporary group with two MCPTT groups is represented. The procedure is
applicable for more than two groups combined in this temporary group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, it considers the partner MCPTT system does not
share their users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The primary MCPTT system consists of the group management server 1 and
MCPTT server (primary). The partner MCPTT system consists of the group
management server 2 and MCPTT server (partner).
3\. The group management client of the authorized MCPTT user belongs to the
primary MCPTT system.
4\. The temporary group to be torn down is comprised of multiple MCPTT groups,
and is created through the group regrouping procedure as described in
subclause 10.4.4.2.
Figure 10.4.4.3-1: Temporary group tear down
1\. The group management client of the MCPTT user requests group regroup
teardown operation to the group management server 1 (which is the group
management server where the temporary group is created and stored). The
identity of the temporary group (MCPTT group ID) being torn down shall be
included in this message. This message may route through some other signalling
nodes.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MCPTT user, based on group policy. The group
management server 1 checks whether the MCPTT group ID is a temporary group. If
MCPTT group ID is not a temporary group, then the group regroup teardown
request will be rejected, otherwise the group regroup teardown can proceed.
3\. Any active group call for the temporary group is completed.
4\. The group management server 1 tears down the temporary group, i.e., remove
the temporary group related information.
5\. The group management server 1 notifies the primary MCPTT application
server regarding the temporary group teardown.
6\. The group management server 1 notifies the affiliated MCPTT group members
regarding the temporary group teardown.
7\. The group management server 1 sends a group regroup teardown notification
(7a) and receives a group regroup teardown notification response (7b) messages
with the group management server 2 -- group management server in another MCPTT
system regarding the temporary group teardown.
8-9. The group management server 2 notifies the partner MCPTT server and the
affiliated MCPTT group members regarding the temporary group teardown.
NOTE: Step 7, 8 and 9 are only performed when the teardown of the temporary
group involves constituent groups from different MCPTT systems.
10\. The group management server 1 provides a group regroup teardown
confirmation response to the group management client of the authorized MCPTT
user.
## 10.5 Pre-established session (on-network)
### 10.5.1 General
The MCPTT server may use one or more pre-established sessions for the
following procedures for on-network:
\- Group calls (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.3 and subclause 10.6.2.4);
\- Private calls (as specified in subclause 10.7.2.2 and subclause 10.7.2.3);
\- MCPTT emergency group calls (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.6.1);
\- MCPTT imminent peril group calls (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.6.2);
\- MCPTT emergency private calls (as specified in subclause 10.7.2.4); and
\- MCPTT emergency alerts (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.6.3).
The MCPTT client establishes one or more pre-established sessions to an MCPTT
server after SIP registration, and prior to initiating any of the above
procedures to other MCPTT users. When establishing a pre-established session,
the MCPTT client negotiates the media parameters, including establishing IP
addresses and ports using interactive connectivity establishment (ICE) as
specified in IETF RFC 5245 [15], which later can be used in MCPTT calls. This
avoids the need to negotiate media parameters (including evaluating ICE
candidates) and reserving bearer resources during the MCPTT call establishment
that results in delayed MCPTT call establishment.
For outgoing MCPTT call setup for a private call or a pre-arranged group call
using a pre-established session, an MCPTT UE uses SIP procedures to establish
the call.
For incoming MCPTT call setup for a pre-arranged group call using a pre-
established session, an MCPTT UE is notified of the start of the MCPTT call
using floor control messages.
For incoming MCPTT call setup for a private call using a pre-established
session, an MCPTT UE is notified of the start of the MCPTT call control using
SIP procedures in manual commencement mode and using floor control procedures
in automatic commencement mode.
An MCPTT UE can join an MCPTT chat group using a pre-established session by
sending a group join request using SIP procedures.
NOTE: A chat group call is started and notified using floor control messages
regardless of whether pre-established session is used.
The use of pre-established session on the origination side is completely
compatible with the use of on demand session on the termination side. The use
of pre-established session on the termination side is completely compatible
with the use of on demand session on the origination side.
The pre-established session may be modified by the MCPTT client and the MCPTT
server using the SIP procedures for session modification.
The pre-established session may be released by the MCPTT client and the MCPTT
server using the SIP procedures for terminating a SIP session.
### 10.5.2 Information flows for pre-established session

### 10.5.3 Procedures
#### 10.5.3.1 General
The pre-established session can be established after MCPTT service
authorization for the user (see clause 10.2)
The pre-established session is a session establishment procedure between the
MCPTT client and the MCPTT server to exchange necessary media parameters
needed for the definition of the media bearers. After the pre-established
session is established, the media bearer carrying the floor control messages
is always active. Additionally, the MCPTT client is able to activate the media
bearer carrying the voice whenever needed:
\- immediately after the pre-established session procedure; or
\- using SIP signalling when an MCPTT call is initiated.
#### 10.5.3.2 Pre-established session establishment
The pre-established session is a session between the MCPTT client and the
MCPTT server in the MCPTT system, and which may utilise other functional
entities (e.g. a media distribution function, as defined in subclause
7.4.2.3.5, for means of obtaining media parameters and gathering ICE
candidates). Figure 10.5.3.2-1 represents the pre-established session
establishment flow.
Figure 10.5.3.2-1: Pre-established session establishment
1\. The MCPTT client within the MCPTT UE gathers ICE candidates.
2\. The MCPTT client within the MCPTT UE sends a request to the MCPTT server
to create a pre-established session.
3\. MCPTT server performs necessary service control, obtains media parameters
(e.g. by means of interacting with a media distribution function of the MCPTT
server) and gathers ICE candidates.
4\. MCPTT server sends a create pre-establish session response to the MCPTT
client within the MCPTT UE.
5\. ICE candidate pair checks take place e.g. between the MCPTT client within
the MCPTT UE and a media distribution function of the MCPTT server.
6\. If necessary the MCPTT client within the MCPTT UE sends a modify pre-
established session request to the MCPTT server to update the ICE candidate
pair for the pre-established session.
7\. The MCPTT server sends a modify pre-established session response accepting
the ICE candidate pair update.
The media sessions are consisting of at least an active media session carrying
the floor control messages with bearer of QCI \"Mission Critical delay
sensitive signalling\" and an inactive media session for the voice media
(which is carried when active by a GBR of QCI \"Mission Critical user plane
Push To Talk voice\").
NOTE: The mission critical specific QCIs are defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [4].
#### 10.5.3.3 Pre-established session modification
Figure 10.5.3.3-1 represents the pre-established session modification flow.
Figure 10.5.3.3-1: Pre-established session modification
1\. The MCPTT client within the MCPTT UE gathers ICE candidates, if necessary
(e.g. depending on the information that needs to be updated).
2\. The MCPTT client within the MCPTT UE sends a request to the MCPTT server
to modify a pre-established session.
3\. MCPTT server performs necessary service control, obtains any necessary
media parameters (e.g. by means of interacting with a media distribution
function of the MCPTT server) and gathers necessary ICE candidates.
4\. MCPTT server sends a modify pre-establish session response to the MCPTT
client within the MCPTT UE.
5\. If necessary, ICE candidate pair checks take place e.g. between the MCPTT
client within the MCPTT UE and a media distribution function of the MCPTT
server.
6\. If necessary the MCPTT client within the MCPTT UE sends a modify pre-
established session request to the MCPTT server to update the ICE candidate
pair for the pre-established session.
7\. The MCPTT server sends a modify pre-established session response accepting
the ICE candidate pair update.
NOTE 1: The represented procedure corresponds to a session modification
initiated by the MCPTT client. It can also be initiated by the MCPTT server.
NOTE 2: The procedure can also be used to switch a media session from the
inactive to the active state and the reverse. The modification of the session
triggers a corresponding modification of the characteristics (e.g. activity,
bandwidth) of the corresponding GBR bearers.
#### 10.5.3.4 Pre-established session release
Figure 10.5.3.4-1 represents the MCPTT client within the MCPTT UE initiated
pre-established session release flow and figure 10.5.3.4-2 represents the
MCPTT server initiated pre-established session release flow.

#### 10.5.3.5 Call connect and disconnect procedures using pre-established
session
##### 10.5.3.5.1 Call connect and disconnect over unicast
Call connect and disconnect information flows are sent over non-SIP media
plane signalling using MCPTT-4 for including or releasing an MCPTT client in
the call using a pre-established session.
Figure 10.5.3.5.1-1 shows the high level procedure where a call connect
information flow is sent by the MCPTT server to inform MCPTT client(s) using a
pre-established session that the MCPTT client(s) has/have been connected to an
MCPTT private call or group call.
Figure 10.5.3.5.1-1: Connect procedure
1\. Pre-established session exists between MCPTT client A and MCPTT server.
2\. MCPTT server has determined to include MCPTT client A in the call e.g.,
upon receiving the request from another MCPTT client to include MCPTT client A
in the call.
3\. Pre-established session call connect request information flow is sent by
the MCPTT server to inform MCPTT client A using a pre-established session that
it has been connected to MCPTT private or group call. The floor control is
established between floor participant A and floor control server.
Figure 10.5.3.5.1-2 shows the high level procedure where a disconnect
information flow is sent by the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client A to indicate
that the MCPTT private call or group call using a pre-established session has
been released.
Figure 10.5.3.5.1-2: Disconnect procedure
1\. Floor control is ongoing within a private or group call established using
pre-established session.
2\. MCPTT server has determined to release MCPTT client A from the call e.g.,
due to call release.
3\. Pre-established session call disconnect request message is sent by the
MCPTT server to indicate to MCPTT client A that the MCPTT private call or
group call using a pre-established session has been released. Pre-established
session between MCPTT client A and MCPTT server remains for further use.
## 10.6 Group call
### 10.6.1 General
Group calls are enabled in both on-network and off-network.
### 10.6.2 On-network group call
#### 10.6.2.1 General
This subclause contains procedures for group call across a single and multiple
MCPTT servers, and associated functions such as emergency call, broadcast call
and others.
Two variations of group call model are described in subclause 10.6.2.3, the

###### 10.6.2.3.1.1 Pre-arranged group call
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.1 General {#general-23 .H6}
A pre-arranged group call is initiated by one of the group members. The
initiation of a pre-arranged group call results in all other affiliated group
members being invited.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.2 Pre-arranged group call setup {#pre-arranged-group-call-
setup .H6}
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT
group call with unicast signalling for communicating with the affiliated MCPTT
members of that group.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT group
call with a pre-arranged group i.e., MCPTT users on client 1, client 2 and
client 3 belong to the same group which is defined in the MCPTT group
management server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A pre-arranged group is an MCPTT group that is pre-defined with MCPTT
group ID and member list in the group management server. All members of the
group belong to the same MCPTT system.
2\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 are already registered for receiving MCPTT service and affiliated.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup
1\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT group call with a
selected group (identified by MCPTT group ID).
NOTE 1: MCPTT client 1 need not be aware of the affiliation status of other
MCPTT clients to the group while initiating the group call.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCPTT server via the
SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by MCPTT
group ID. The group call request also contains the MCPTT group ID and an SDP
offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters. If there is a floor
request to transmit, then the group call request contains an indication of an
implicit floor request.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to
initiate a group call for the selected group. If authorized and the group call
is ongoing for that MCPTT group ID, the MCPTT server adds the requesting MCPTT
client 1 to the existing MCPTT group call and notifies the MCPTT client 1 that
the MCPTT group call is already in progress. Otherwise, MCPTT server resolves
the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that group and their
affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server.
NOTE 2: MCPTT server can have already retrieved the user/group configuration
data and locally cached. If the user/group configuration data is not locally
cached on the MCPTT server then MCPTT server requests the user/group
configuration data from the MCPTT user database/group management server.
4\. MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT
service, offers the same media parameters or a subset of the media parameters
contained in the initial received request and sends the corresponding group
call request via the SIP core towards the MCPTT clients of each of those
affiliated group members. MCPTT users are notified about the incoming group
call. The MCPTT server indicates whether acknowledgement is required for the
call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT clients accept the group call request, and a group
call response is sent to the group host MCPTT server. This response may
contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be
based on configuration.
6\. MCPTT server sends the group call response including the selected media
parameters to the MCPTT client 1 through the signalling path to inform about
successful call establishment.
NOTE 3: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
7\. If the initiating MCPTT user requires the acknowledgement from affiliated
MCPTT group members, and the required MCPTT group members do not acknowledge
the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup
timeout\"), then the MCPTT server may proceed with or abandon the call and
then notify the initiating MCPTT user that the acknowledgements did not
include all required members according to group policy. This notification may
be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by the MCPTT server more than once during
the call when MCPTT users join or leave the MCPTT group call.
8\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established media
plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor participant 2 and
floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g., MCPTT client 1
receives the floor granted information over the established media plane
assuming implicit floor control request from MCPTT client 1 while at the same
time floor participants at other MCPTT client\'s receive floor taken
information. MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is
available to send media, while the other MCPTT clients in the group call will
be receiving that media.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.3 Release pre-arranged group call {#release-pre-arranged-
group-call .H6}
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server initiates the
termination of an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that
group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., due
to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant
leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group
members are not present.
NOTE: The procedure for MCPTT user leaving the group call is a different
scenario and is not considered in this solution.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT
group call.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1: Release pre-arranged group call
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3
are already part of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of pre-arranged
group call setup).
2\. MCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT group call which is ongoing
e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT
group members are not present.
3\. MCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and
generates group call release request to release ongoing session.
4\. MCPTT server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards each
participant of the ongoing group call.
5\. MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
6\. MCPTT client(s) receiving group call release request, acknowledge towards
the MCPTT server by sending a group call release response.
7\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor
control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is
terminated.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.4 Late entry pre-arranged group call {#late-entry-pre-

Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server requesting a newly affiliated member or a
member coming back from out of coverage to join an ongoing MCPTT group call.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MCPTT system.
2\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on
an ongoing call.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1: Late entry pre-arranged group call
1\. MCPTT server determines that MCPTT client 1 which is newly affiliated or
coming back from out of coverage has to be invited to join an ongoing group
call (late entry).
2\. MCPTT server generates group call request including the information such
as MCPTT service identifier (possible for the SIP core to route the request to
the MCPTT server), MCPTT group ID of the group invited to join, offer one or
more media types and sends towards the MCPTT client 1 via SIP core.
3\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is notified about the incoming group call.
4\. Upon MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 accepting the incoming group call
request, MCPTT client 1 sends the group call response including the selected
media types to the MCPTT server through the signalling path. If the incoming
group call request is rejected by the MCPTT client 1, the MCPTT server should
not resend the group call request
5\. MCPTT client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCPTT
users at MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n may be notified about the MCPTT
client 1 joining the group call.
6\. The floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to
MCPTT client1.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.5 Rejoining call {#rejoining-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.5-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client to rejoin an ongoing MCPTT group call (e.g.
coming back from out of coverage).
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on
an ongoing call.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.5-1: Rejoin call
1\. MCPTT client 1 has necessary information for rejoining an ongoing group
call, then the MCPTT client 1 initiates group call rejoin request including
the ongoing group call information.
2\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT client 1 can rejoin the ongoing call
(e.g. based upon affiliation status).
3\. MCPTT client 1 is informed that the group call rejoin is successful by
sending a group call rejoin response.
4\. MCPTT client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCPTT
users at MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n may be notified about the MCPTT
client 1 joining the group call.
5\. The floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to
MCPTT client 1.
###### 10.6.2.3.1.2 Chat group call
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.1 General {#general-24 .H6}
In a chat group (restricted) call model, the MCPTT user individually joins a
group call without being invited. The establishment of a chat group
(restricted) call does not result in other group members being invited.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client
initiating an MCPTT group call which uses the chat group (restricted) call
model. Restricted means that only users that have been configured as members
of the given group are allowed to join the group communications for the given
group.
Chat group join mechanism:
\- Each MCPTT client sends a group join request when the MCPTT user wants to
participate in the group communication for the group. (This message does not
impact the MCPTT user\'s membership in the group; the MCPTT server will verify
that the MCPTT user is an authorized member of the group.)
\- The group join request may include a request to transmit. It is assumed
that the group join request will be delivered from MCPTT client to MCPTT
server using SIP.
\- The group join request is used to indicate to the MCPTT server that the
MCPTT user associated with the given MCPTT client wishes to participate (begin
to receive media) from the group.
\- The group join request may cause the MCPTT server to generate an implicit
affiliation for the MCPTT user to the group, if the user is not already
affiliated to the group.
\- The group join request normally contains the information needed to
negotiate media parameters between MCPTT server and MCPTT client for the group
call. The group join request can take the form of a SIP invite.
Subsequent participation in a group call when the group is using the chat
model:
\- Once an MCPTT client successfully joins a group call which is using the
chat model, the MCPTT client connects to the media plane for the call if the
call is currently ongoing.
\- If the MCPTT group call is not currently ongoing (i.e.: when MCPTT clients
on the group call are not sending or receiving media, and the time out between
floor control exchanges has expired) then the newly joined MCPTT client will
only have pre-established its media parameters for the call.
\- If the newly joined MCPTT user wishes to transmit media (start or re-start
the call) to the affiliated users of the group using the chat model, then the
MCPTT client using its associated floor control participant would follow a
normal floor control procedure for requesting the floor.
\- Since subsequent group call media transmissions are controlled using floor
control signalling, additional SIP signalling messages may not be required for
subsequent call stop and start.
\- Each request to transmit from an MCPTT user could be viewed as a new
instance of a group call for the given group when the floor idle timer expires
and no media is present for an extended time.
\- The MCPTT server may tear down the media plane between successive group
calls using the chat model, or the MCPTT server may allow the media plane to
remain up between successive group calls using the chat model depending on
resources.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.2 Chat group call setup {#chat-group-call-setup .H6}
MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are served by the home MCPTT service
provider in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1.
Pre-condition:
1\. The MCPTT server may use the group join request to generate an implicit
affiliation (using the affiliation procedure in subclause 10.3.3) on behalf of
the client that sends the MCPTT group join request.
2\. MCPTT user 2 and MCPTT user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to the
group. MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and all users
(MCPTT user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and authorized to
use the MCPTT service. No call is currently in progress for the group.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1: MCPTT chat group call
1\. MCPTT user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group. This
may include a request to transmit.
1a. MCPTT client 1 sends a group join request with the MCPTT group ID of the
desired group. It contains the MCPTT user\'s MCPTT ID and the MCPTT client
media parameters. If there is a request to transmit, then the group joint
request contains an indication of an implicit floor request.
1b. The MCPTT server receives the group join request. MCPTT server generates
an implicit affiliation (if the MCPTT user is not already affiliated to the
group) and verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group
by following the affiliation procedure (subclause 10.3.3).
1c. The MCPTT server replies with a group join response indicating the
acceptance of the group join request and also returns the MCPTT server
selected media parameters for the group call in the group join response.
2\. If MCPTT user 1 requests to transmit, the MCPTT server establishes the
media plane (if not already established) for the call. The associated floor
participants for MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 use the floor control
procedure to initiate the call. E.g., the floor participant for MCPTT client 1
receives the MCPTT floor grant. The corresponding floor participants for MCPTT
client 2 and MCPTT client 3 receive the MCPTT floor taken.
3\. Floor control will continue to be used by the floor participants
associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 for the
duration of the call. Media plane signalling using floor control will be used
for subsequent calls for the group as long as one or more users are
affiliated.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.3 Release chat group call {#release-chat-group-call .H6}
The procedure describes the case where the MCPTT server releases an ongoing
MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least
one of the conditions for release are met e.g. due to hang time expiry, last
participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or
the number of affiliated MCPTT group members is below the minimum number
permitted.
NOTE 1: The procedure for an MCPTT user leaving the group call is a different
procedure.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.3-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT server
initiating the release of an ongoing MCPTT group call.
The following precondition applies:
\- A group call is ongoing between MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3

#### 10.6.2.4 Group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems
##### 10.6.2.4.1 Group call for temporary groups across multiple MCPTT systems
###### 10.6.2.4.1.1 Group call setup
##### 10.6.2.4.1.1.1 Group call setup procedure -- originating side {#group-
call-setup-procedure-originating-side .H6}
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.1-1 illustrates the originating side group call involving
groups from multiple MCPTT systems. It considers the scenario for group
hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group regroup. The protocol
followed may be SIP.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share their users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The MCPTT user belongs to an MCPTT group hosted by the primary MCPTT
system.
3\. A temporary group is formed by authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher by the
group regroup procedure (subclause 10.4.4.2) and identified via a temporary
MCPTT group ID.
4\. The MCPTT group members of the constituent MCPTT groups belonging to the
temporary group are affiliated to participate in a group call for the
temporary group.
5\. The authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group on the
MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.
6\. The constituent groups of the temporary group may belong to MCPTT servers
of the partner MCPTT systems.
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.1-1: Group call setup involving temporary groups from
multiple MCPTT systems (originating)
1\. The affiliated MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call with an
MCPTT group ID. A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is routed
to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the group and is
where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group. If the
group call is for a temporary group formed by the group regroup procedure, the
MCPTT group ID will be a temporary MCPTT group ID.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system gets the group information
(either from group management server or itself) including the constituent
MCPTT groups\' identities, accessible group members list of the constituent
groups, and other related data.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates directly a call
request to the accessible group members using the detailed user information
and/or location information. The group members upon receipt of the call
request may accept or reject the call. Alternatively, the MCPTT server of the
primary MCPTT system notifies the group members via a notification message
containing the MCPTT group ID and/or the group call session identity
information. Upon receipt of the notification message, the group members may
perform a late call entry.
4\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may not have access to group
members\' information of the constituent group belonging to the partner MCPTT
system. For such group members, the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system
initiates a group call request message to the MCPTT server of the partner
MCPTT system with the target group\'s MCPTT group ID information.
5\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system further initiates a call
request or call notification to the constituent group\'s members as described
in step 3.
6\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call
response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system with success or
failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.
7\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT client of the affiliated MCPTT user upon
receiving responses to the call requests sent to members of primary and
partner MCPTT systems. The group call response message will consist of the
success or failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a
failure.
NOTE: The group call response message is triggered depending on the conditions
to proceed with the call.
8\. Upon successful call setup completion a group call is established for the
group members from constituent groups of multiple MCPTT servers.
##### 10.6.2.4.1.1.2 Group call setup procedure -- terminating side {#group-
call-setup-procedure-terminating-side .H6}
The procedure in figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.2-1 illustrates the terminating side
group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems. It considers the
scenario for group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group regroup.
The protocol followed may be SIP.
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.2-1: Group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT
systems (terminating)
1\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system sends the group call request
message to the MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT system.
2\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system determines whether to forward
the group call request message to the MCPTT client(s) based on the user
affiliation.
3\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system forwards the group call
request message to MCPTT client(s). The MCPTT server indicates whether
acknowledgement is required for the call.
4\. The MCPTT user is notified about the incoming MCPTT group call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client(s) accept the group call request and a group
call response message is sent to the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system.
This response may contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending
acknowledgement may be based on configuration.
6\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system forwards the group call
response message to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system (i.e. group
hosting MCPTT server for the group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT
systems).
###### 10.6.2.4.1.2 Group call release
The procedure focuses on the case where the group host MCPTT server releases
an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call
involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems, since at least one of the
release conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant
leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number
of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.
NOTE: The scenario of MCPTT user leaving the group call is not considered in
this procedure.
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the MCPTT server releasing
an ongoing MCPTT group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system is controlling the group call
involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 belongs to group of the MCPTT server of the primary
MCPTT system and the MCPTT client 2 and client 3 belong to the groups of the
MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system.
3\. The MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part
of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of group call setup involving
groups from multiple MCPTT systems).
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.2-1: Group call release involving groups from multiple MCPTT
systems
1\. The MCPTT server of primary MCPTT system would like to release the MCPTT
group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang timer expiry, last participant
leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number
of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system identifies the participants
of the ongoing group call and generates group call release message to release
ongoing session.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates a group call
release request message via SIP core towards each accessible participant of
the ongoing group call (3a). The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may
not have access to group members\' information of the constituent group
belonging to a partner MCPTT system. For such group members, the MCPTT server
of the primary MCPTT system initiates a group call release request message
(3b) to the MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT system(s) with the target
group\'s MCPTT group ID information. The MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT
system(s) further initiate group call release request messages (3c-1, 3c-2) to
its group\'s users.
4\. The MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
5\. The MCPTT client(s) receiving the group call release request messages
provide group call release response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT
system. The MCPTT client(s) of the MCPTT users belonging to partner MCPTT
system(s) route their responses via the MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT
system(s).
6\. The MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
floor control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is
released.
##### 10.6.2.4.2 Group call for temporary group formed by group regroup
procedure involving multiple MCPTT systems via trusted mode
Figure 10.6.2.4.2-1 illustrates a group call involving a temporary group
formed by group regroup from multiple MCPTT systems. The protocol followed may
be SIP.
Pre-conditions:

partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system shares their
users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The MCPTT user belongs to an MCPTT group hosted by the primary MCPTT
system.
3\. A temporary group is formed by authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher by the
group regroup procedure (subclause 10.4.4.2) and identified via a temporary
MCPTT group ID.
4\. The MCPTT group members of the constituent MCPTT groups belonging to the
temporary group are affiliated to participate in a group call for the
temporary group.
5\. The authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group on the
MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.
6\. The constituent groups of the temporary group may belong to MCPTT servers
of the partner MCPTT systems.
Figure 10.6.2.4.2-1: Group call involving temporary group formed by group
regroup from multiple MCPTT systems
1\. The affiliated MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call with an
MCPTT group ID. A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is routed
to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the temporary
group formed by group regroup procedure, and is also where the authorized
MCPTT user/dispatcher has created the temporary group. The MCPTT group ID will
be a temporary MCPTT group ID.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system gets the group information
(either from group management server or itself) including the constituent
MCPTT groups\' identities, and other related data.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may interrogate the MCPTT
server of the partner MCPTT system for the affiliated group 2 members.
4\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system responds with a list of the
affiliated group members of group 2.
NOTE 1: Steps 3 and 4 do not occur if the constituent groups\' information is
available and up to date at primary MCPTT system due to the procedure for
temporary group formation as defined in subclause 10.4.4.2.
5\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system verifies the commencement
policies of the temporary group, and initiates a call invitation or call
notification to the affiliated members of groups 1 and 2.
6\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides group call response
message to the MCPTT UE of authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher upon receiving
responses to the call invitations sent to members of primary and partner MCPTT
systems. The group call response will consist of the success or failure result
and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.
7\. Upon successful call setup completion a group call is established for the
group members belonging to constituent groups of multiple MCPTT systems.
NOTE 2: MCPTT clients are generally aware that their (constituent) groups have
been regrouped (e.g., see subclause 10.1.5.3); however, if not, the partner
MCPTT server of the constituent group can also respond to a group call request
with a redirection response, such as \"moved temporarily\" that includes the
group URI of the temporary group formed by group regroup procedure.

2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system determines the group home
MCPTT server where the MCPTT group is defined.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the group call
request to the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system which owns the group
and is where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group.
4\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system checks whether the user of
MCPTT client is authorized for initiating the group call for the selected
group. If authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members
of that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from
group management server.
5\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system initiates a call request to
the group\'s affiliated members.
6\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system of the MCPTT

6\. The MCPTT server (primary) contacts the active members of group 2 inviting
them to join the temporary group call.
7\. The MCPTT server (partner) transfers group 2\'s floor status data
(including pending requests and queue positions) to the primary MCPTT server
and combines this with the group 1\'s floor status data in order to create the
temporary group\'s floor status data.
8\. The MCPTT server (primary) performs floor control for the temporary group.
9\. The MCPTT server (primary) notifies the MCPTT client of the authorised
MCPTT user that the active calls have been merged.
NOTE: The MCPTT server in primary system revokes and queues floor given to one
of the two talkers based on the arbitration result for the temporary group.
#### 10.6.2.5 Broadcast group call
##### 10.6.2.5.1 General
A broadcast group call is a special group call where the initiating MCPTT user
expects no response from the other MCPTT users, so that when his transmission
is complete, so is the call.
##### 10.6.2.5.2 Common broadcast group call procedure
The group-broadcast group and the regrouped group are similar in structure (a
collection of groups). Similarly the user-broadcast group and the pre-arranged
group (a collection of users) are similar in structure. Only the call
originator can transmit media during the broadcast group call and the
broadcast group call is released when the transmission is complete.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2-1 illustrates the common procedure both for group-broadcast
group call and user-broadcast group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are members of a group-broadcast
group/user-broadcast group.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2-1: Broadcast group call
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates the broadcast group call setup
procedure with the indication of broadcast group call. The signalling
procedure is identical to the group call setup as described in subclause
10.6.2 with the inclusion of the parameter for broadcast group call indicator.
NOTE 1: Broadcast group call applies to both pre-arranged and chat group call
model. In the chat group call model case, the broadcast group call setup
procedure is done by floor control signalling.
2\. MCPTT client 1 starts to transmit media.
NOTE 2: Only the call originating MCPTT user is allowed to transmit media on
broadcast group call.
NOTE 3: A broadcast group call transmitted on a user-broadcast group has
priority over group calls involving users within the user hierarchy. A
broadcast group call transmitted on a group-broadcast group has priority over
group calls on its subordinate groups.
3\. If the media transmission from call originating MCPTT user is complete,
the broadcast group call is released.
##### 10.6.2.5.3 Temporary group -- broadcast group call procedure
Figure 10.6.2.5.3-1 illustrates the procedure for temporary group-broadcast
group call procedure. The protocol used may be SIP.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share their users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MCPTT system.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system is where the authorized MCPTT
user/dispatcher created the temporary group.
4\. Other groups in the temporary group -- broadcast group may belong to
partner MCPTT systems.
Figure 10.6.2.5.3-1: Temporary group -- broadcast group call
1\. The MCPTT client of authorized user initiates a group call with multiple
groups from primary and partner MCPTT systems. A group call request message
with the MCPTT group IDs (group1\'s MCPTT group ID, group2\'s MCPTT group ID)
is routed to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which is where the
authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forms the temporary group
with the groups\' information received. It resolves the MCPTT group IDs and
identifies the appropriate MCPTT server responsible for the groups. It further
triggers a temporary group -- broadcast group call via a group call request
message to the affiliated group members of group1\'s MCPTT group ID of the
MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.
NOTE 1: The temporary group information is not notified to the group members
of the constituent groups.
3\. A group call request message is further initiated with the MCPTT server of
the partner MCPTT system for group2\'s MCPTT group ID.
4\. Upon receiving the group call request message from the MCPTT server of the
primary MCPTT system, the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system initiates a
call invitation to their affiliated group members. The group members upon
receipt of the invitation may accept or reject the call. Alternatively, the
MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system notifies the group members via a
notification message containing the group call session identity information.
Upon receipt of the notification message, the group members may perform a late
call entry.
5\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system with success
or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of failure.
6\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT client of the authorized MCPTT user upon
receiving response to the corresponding group call request with the MCPTT
server of the partner MCPTT system. The group call response will consist of
the success or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of
failure.
NOTE 2: The group call response message is triggered depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
7\. Upon successful group call setup, a group call is established amongst the
multiple group members from primary and partner MCPTT systems. The call
originating MCPTT user starts transmitting media to other group call
participants.
NOTE 3: Only the call originating MCPTT user is allowed to transmit media on
broadcast group call.
NOTE 4: A broadcast group call transmitted on a temporary group-broadcast
group has priority over group calls on its subordinate groups.
8\. At the completion of the media transmission, the broadcast group call is
released, and the temporary group -- broadcast group is torn down.
#### 10.6.2.6 Emergency and imminent peril procedures
##### 10.6.2.6.1 MCPTT emergency group call
###### 10.6.2.6.1.1 MCPTT emergency group call commencement
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT
emergency group call with the affiliated MCPTT members of that MCPTT group. An
MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency state gains elevated access privilege for
all of the MCPTT user\'s mission critical applications.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.1-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT emergency
group call with an MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT
client 2 and MCPTT client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on
MCPTT group management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
that has been designated via provisioning as the MCPTT emergency group.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the selected group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.1-1: MCPTT emergency group call
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency group call.
MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is
retained until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT group call request towards the MCPTT server.
The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. The MCPTT server
records the identity of the MCPTT user that initiated the MCPTT emergency
group call until the MCPTT emergency is cancelled. Once an MCPTT emergency
call has been initiated, the MCPTT group is considered to be in an in-progress
emergency state until cancelled. If configured to send an MCPTT emergency
alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency group call, the request also contains
an indication that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be initiated. The request
may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates the MCPTT client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
for initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated MCPTT group, and if
authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
NOTE 3: Successive calls during the MCPTT group\'s in-progress emergency state
will all receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request
contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an
indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the originator
indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the incoming MCPTT group call.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT emergency group call request. For
a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to inform the successful MCPTT emergency call establishment.
NOTE 4: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have successfully
established media plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor
participant 2 and floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g.,
MCPTT client 1 receives the floor granted information over the established
media plane, while the other MCPTT client\'s receive floor taken information.
MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is available to send
media, while the other MCPTT clients in the MCPTT emergency group call will be
receiving that media. MCPTT client 1 can override other clients in the call
except those that are also in the MCPTT emergency state.
###### 10.6.2.6.1.2 MCPTT group call upgraded to an MCPTT emergency group call
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading
an MCPTT group call to an MCPTT emergency group call while the MCPTT group
call is already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client upgrading an MCPTT group call on an MCPTT
group to an MCPTT emergency group call.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. An MCPTT group call is already in progress.
4\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been configured to send an MCPTT
emergency alert when upgrading an MCPTT emergency group call.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.2-1: MCPTT group call upgraded to an MCPTT emergency group
call
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCPTT client
1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the MCPTT group to an
in-progress emergency state by sending an MCPTT emergency group call request.
If configured to send an MCPTT alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency
upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCPTT alert is to be
initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
4\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request
contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the
originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
5\. MCPTT users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the MCPTT
group.
6\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT group emergency request. For a
multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to confirm the upgrade request. If the MCPTT emergency request
contained an implicit floor request, the OK message contains the result of the
implicit floor request.
NOTE 2: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 continue with the MCPTT
group call, which has been transformed into an MCPTT emergency group call.
MCPTT client 1 can override other clients in the call except those that are
also in the MCPTT emergency state.
###### 10.6.2.6.1.3 MCPTT emergency group call cancel
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client cancels an MCPTT
group\'s in-progress emergency.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an in-progress emergency.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
NOTE 2: The end of the MCPTT emergency group call does not cancel the MCPTT
group\'s in-progress emergency state. It is explicitly cancelled by an
authorized user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. MCPTT group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.
4\. The MCPTT group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized
bearer support.
5\. MCPTT client 1 previously initiated the in-progress emergency.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1: MCPTT emergency group cancel
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency group cancel.
NOTE 3: An MCPTT user authorized to cancel in-progress emergencies on the
MCPTT group can also be authorised to cancel the MCPTT emergency alert in
addition to the initiator. However, only the initiator can cancel the
initiator\'s local MCPTT emergency state.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency group call cancel request to the
MCPTT server.
NOTE 4: When MCPTT emergency alerts are in effect together with an MCPTT
emergency group condition on the same MCPTT group, the MCPTT emergency alert
can, under some circumstances be cancelled at the same time. In that case, the
MCPTT emergency group cancel request carries an indication that the alert is
also being cancelled.
3\. MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based upon the information from
group management server.
4\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCPTT server cancels/resets the emergency
in-progress state of the MCPTT group.
5\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT emergency group call cancel request to the
MCPTT group members.
6\. MCPTT group members are notified of the MCPTT emergency cancel.
7\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call cancel
response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT emergency cancel. For a
multicast call scenario, these acknowledgements are not sent.
8\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call cancel response to
the MCPTT user 1 to confirm the MCPTT emergency group cancel. MCPTT client 1
resets its local emergency status since it is the one requesting the MCPTT
emergency group cancel.
NOTE 5: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
##### 10.6.2.6.2 MCPTT imminent peril group call
###### 10.6.2.6.2.1 MCPTT imminent peril group call commencement
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is initiating
an imminent peril group call for communicating with the affiliated MCPTT
members of that MCPTT group. This procedure will gain elevated access
privilege for the MCPTT client if it is not already in that state. The access
privilege for other applications will not necessarily be affected.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.1-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an imminent peril
group call with an MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT
client 2 and MCPTT client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on
MCPTT group management server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
that has been designated in the provisioning to be used for imminent peril
communications.
NOTE 1: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for imminent
peril behaviour on the selected group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.2.1-1: MCPTT imminent peril group call
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an imminent peril group call.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT imminent peril group call request towards
the MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the in-progress
imminent peril. The MCPTT server records the identity of the MCPTT user that
initiated the imminent peril group call until the in-progress imminent peril
state is cancelled. Once an imminent peril group call has been initiated, the
MCPTT group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates the MCPTT client 1 to the imminent
peril group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
for initiation of imminent peril group calls on the indicated MCPTT group, and
if authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
NOTE 2: Successive calls during the in-progress imminent peril state will all
receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCPTT server sends the imminent peril group call request towards the MCPTT
clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request contains
an indication of the in-progress imminent peril.
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the incoming imminent peril call.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT imminent peril group call
response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the imminent peril call request.
For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not set.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to inform the successful imminent peril call establishment. If
the MCPTT imminent peril request contained an implicit floor request, the OK
message contains the result of the implicit floor request.
NOTE 3: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the imminent peril call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have successfully
established media plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor
participant 2 and floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g.,
MCPTT client 1 receives the floor granted information over the established
media plane, while the other MCPTT clients receive floor taken information.
MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is available to send
media, while the other MCPTT clients in the imminent peril call will be
receiving that media.
###### 10.6.2.6.2.2 Imminent peril group call upgrade
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading
an MCPTT group call to an imminent peril group call while the MCPTT group call
is already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client upgrading an MCPTT group call on an MCPTT
group to an imminent peril group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT
group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.

Figure 10.6.2.6.2.2-1: MCPTT group call upgrade to an imminent peril group
call
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an imminent peril call.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the MCPTT group to an
in-progress imminent peril state by sending an MCPTT imminent peril group call
request. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
4\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members.
5\. MCPTT users are notified of the in-progress imminent peril state of the
MCPTT group.
6\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT imminent peril group call
response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT imminent peril group
call request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not set.
7\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to confirm the upgrade request. If the MCPTT imminent peril group
call request contained an implicit floor request, the OK message contains the
result of the implicit floor request.
NOTE: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 continue with the MCPTT
group call, which has been transformed into an imminent peril group call.
###### 10.6.2.6.2.3 MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user cancels an
MCPTT group\'s in-progress imminent peril state.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an MCPTT group\'s in-progress
imminent peril state.
NOTE 1: The end of the imminent peril call does not cancel the MCPTT group\'s
in-progress imminent peril state. It is explicitly cancelled by an authorized
user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT
group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.

bearer support.
4\. MCPTT group members have been notified about the MCPTT group\'s in-
progress imminent peril state.
5\. MCPTT client 1 previously initiated the in-progress imminent peril.
Figure 10.6.2.6.2.3-1: MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an imminent peril cancel.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel request to
the MCPTT server.
3\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCPTT server cancels/resets the in-
progress imminent peril state.
4\. MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based upon the information from
group management server.
5\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel request
to the MCPTT group members.
6\. MCPTT group members are notified of the in-progress imminent peril cancel.
7\. The receiving MCPTT group members send the MCPTT imminent peril group call
cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the in-progress MCPTT
imminent peril group call cancel request to. For a multicast scenario, these
acknowledgements are not set.
8\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel response
to the MCPTT user 1 to confirm the MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel
request.
NOTE 2: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
##### 10.6.2.6.3 MCPTT emergency alert
###### 10.6.2.6.3.1 MCPTT emergency alert initiation
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT
emergency alert unicast signalling for communicating the alert with the
affiliated MCPTT members of that MCPTT group. An MCPTT client in the MCPTT
emergency state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCPTT user\'s
mission critical applications. This procedure will place the MCPTT client in
the MCPTT emergency state if the MCPTT client is not already in that state.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.3.1-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT emergency alert with an
MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on MCPTT group
management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 is affiliated with one or more MCPTT groups.
4\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the currently selected group.
5\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 may not have carried out an explicit
affiliation procedure with the MCPTT group designated as the MCPTT emergency
group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.3.1-1 MCPTT emergency alert
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency alert. MCPTT
client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained
by the MCPTT client until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to send an MCPTT emergency alert
request to the MCPTT group designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
for initiation of MCPTT emergency alerts for the indicated MCPTT group.
4\. MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server.
5\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency alert response to the MCPTT
user 1 to confirm the MCPTT emergency alert request. MCPTT group calls made to
this MCPTT group by the MCPTT client 1 will be sent as emergency calls until
the emergency state on the MCPTT client 1 is cancelled.
6\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT emergency alert request towards the MCPTT
clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The MCPTT emergency
alert request message shall contain the following information: Location, MCPTT
ID and MCPTT group ID (i.e., MCPTT user\'s selected MCPTT group or dedicated
MCPTT emergency group, as per MCPTT group configuration) and the MCPTT user\'s
mission critical organization name.
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the MCPTT emergency.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency alert response to the
MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT emergency alert.
9\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates the MCPTT client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
NOTE 3: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
emergency call does not put the group into the ongoing emergency condition.
NOTE 4: Sending the emergency alert does not put the other UEs in the group
into an emergency state.
NOTE 5: The MCPTT client 1 need not initiate a group call. For example, the
MCPTT client can be configured to only allow alerts or the MCPTT user can
choose not to make an MCPTT emergency group call.
###### 10.6.2.6.3.2 MCPTT emergency state cancel
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client has initiated an MCPTT
emergency alert and entered the emergency state, and wishes to cancel this
state, informing the MCPTT server and other group members of this
cancellation. By doing so, the MCPTT client may also request the cancellation
of the ongoing emergency condition in the group.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.3.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an MCPTT emergency state with an
MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on MCPTT group
management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT client 1 had previously successfully initiated an MCPTT
emergency alert.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 is still in the emergency state.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has affiliated with the MCPTT group
designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.3.2-1 MCPTT emergency state cancel
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency state cancel.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT emergency state cancel request carries an indication to also
request that the in-progress emergency is to be cancelled. The MCPTT server
can accept or deny the request to cancel the ongoing emergency condition of
the group as a whole, separately from accepting or denying the request to
cancel the emergency state at MCPTT client 1. Additionally, an authorized user
can cancel either or both the ongoing emergency condition of the group and the
initiator\'s local MCPTT emergency state.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to send an MCPTT emergency state
cancel to the MCPTT group to which MCPTT client 1 had previously sent the
emergency alert.
3\. MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency state cancel response to the
MCPTT client 1 to confirm the MCPTT emergency state cancel request. MCPTT
client 1 resets its emergency state.
5\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT emergency state cancel request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members.
6\. MCPTT users are notified of the MCPTT emergency state cancellation of
MCPTT client 1.
7\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency state cancel response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT emergency state cancel. For a
multicast call scenario, these acknowledgements are not sent.
### 10.6.3 Off-network group call
#### 10.6.3.1 General
Off-network group calls can use pre-defined configuration information provided
to MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call or configuration
information that is transmitted to MCPTT clients during group call setup or
late entry procedures.
If off-network group configuration information is pre-defined (e.g. codec to
be used) and provided to the MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call
(e.g. as part of group metadata), the MCPTT client will be able to participate
in the off-network group call without needing to follow the group call setup
or late joining procedures as they will be able to receive the media and
signalling without the need for the announcement or invitation.
If off-network group configuration information is not pre-defined or provided,
call parameters need to be transmitted to MCPTT clients via group call
announcement or invitation.
#### 10.6.3.2 Information flows for group call in off-network

#### 10.6.3.3 Group call setup
The flow in figure 10 6.3.3-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for
MCPTT group call establishment for off-network. The procedure describes how an
MCPTT client initiates an MCPTT group call with other MCPTT client within the
off-network radio coverage and how the group call is established.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that information for ProSe direct communications
corresponding to the mappings of MCPTT group ID and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
(see subclause 8.1.3.2) are pre-configured;
\- It is assumed that a multicast IP address and port for the call setup
signalling are pre-configured;
\- All messages exchanged between the MCPTT clients for the MCPTT group
follows ProSe direct communications as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [8]; and
\- The MCPTT users of MCPTT client 1, 2 and 3 belong to the same MCPTT group.
Figure 10.6.3.3-1: Off-network group call setup
1\. MCPTT client 1 as the group call originator sends group call announcement
message to the group. This message contains the following parameters such as
MCPTT group ID, group call originator identity, media type, media codec,
multicast port number for media, port number for floor control protocol,
period of group call announcement, and any encryption key for the media
encryption if needed, and optionally confirm mode indication.
NOTE 1: The group call announcement includes at least one common set of
parameters and values for media transfer. Additional values per parameter will
not be prohibited for the better user experience.
NOTE 2: By using the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID mapping with the MCPTT group ID,
ProSe layer ensures that the messages sent for the corresponding MCPTT group
are only received by its group\'s members.
2\. MCPTT client 2, 3 join the group call. The MCPTT clients configure the
parameters for media delivery by making use of the received parameters in
group call announcement.
3\. MCPTT client 2, 3 may send the response message to the group when the
group call announcement from originator includes confirm mode indication. This
message contains MCPTT ID.
4\. MCPTT client 2, 3 recognize the group call originator through the group
call announcement and MCPTT client 1 checks the participants of the group call
through the received response message.
NOTE 3: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio
coverage) during the off-network group call, the group call announcement
message including parameters for media delivery is periodically sent.
NOTE 4: The participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic
group call announcement.
#### 10.6.3.4 Passive join to group call
Figure 10 6.3.4-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for the passive
MCPTT client to join the on-going MCPTT group call. The passive MCPTT client
does not initiate to establish an MCPTT group call, but receives the group
call announcement to be transferred periodically. When receiving the
announcement message with parameters for media transfer, the passive MCPTT
client configures the parameter to receive the voice and joins the announced
MCPTT group call.
This procedure happens after the MCPTT group call is established. The group
call announcement including the parameters for the media transfer has been
performed periodically, in order for the MCPTT client later to join the MCPTT
group call.
The MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the MCPTT group call lately.
Figure 10.6.3.4-1: Passive join to group call
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the group call announcement message. This message
contains parameters such as MCPTT group ID, group call originator identity,
media type, media codec, multicast port number for media, port number for
floor control protocol, any encryption key for the media encryption if needed,
and optionally confirm mode indication.
NOTE 1: The group call announcement includes at least one common set of
parameters and values for media transfer. Additional values per parameter will
not be prohibited for the better user experience.
2\. MCPTT client 4 configures the parameters for media transfer by making use
of the received parameters in group call announcement.
3\. MCPTT client 4 may send the response message to the group when the
periodic group call announcement includes confirm mode indication. This
message contains the MCPTT ID.
4\. MCPTT client 1, 2, 3 check through the received response message that the
MCPTT client 4 joins the group call. The MCPTT client 2, as the floor control
arbitrator, may send a floor taken message.
NOTE 2: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio
coverage) during the off-network group call, the group call announcement
message including parameters for media delivery is periodically sent.
NOTE 3: The participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic
group call announcement.
#### 10.6.3.5 Join to ongoing group call when new entry member initiates the
call with on-going group call id
Figure 10 6.3.5-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for an MCPTT client
to join an on-going MCPTT group call. When entering the coverage of on-going
group call, new MCPTT client may send group call setup announcement message
with on-going group call id. Upon receiving the group call setup announcement,
the MCPTT client as a participant of on-going MCPTT group call sends
parameters for media transfer to the newly entered MCPTT client (entrant) to
join the on-going MCPTT group call. When receiving the parameters for media
transfer of on-going MCPTT group call, the MCPTT client configures the
parameters to receive the voice and becomes the participant of the on-going
MCPTT group call.
Figure 10.6.3.5-1: Late entry join when receiving MCPTT group call
announcement with on-going MCPTT group ID
1\. MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the on-going MCPTT group call.
2\. The new entry of MCPTT client 4 sends group call setup announcement with
MCPTT group call id.
3\. MCPTT client 1 as a participant of on-going MCPTT group call acknowledges
that on-going MCPTT group call exists with MCPTT group call id sent by MCPTT
client 4 and sends parameters for media transfer to MCPTT client 4.
4\. MCPTT client 4 may send a response message.
5\. MCPTT client 4 sets the parameters for media delivery in the on-going
MCPTT group call.
MCPTT client 4 joins and becomes participants of the on-going MCPTT group
call.
#### 10.6.3.6 Immediate group call announcement to join an ongoing group call
Figure 10.6.3.6-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for an MCPTT client
to immediately join an on-going MCPTT group call. Upon the detection of a new
entrant, the MCPTT client that is the current talker (floor arbitrator)
immediately sends the group call announcement. When receiving the group call
announcement message with parameters for media transfer, that MCPTT client
configures the parameters to receive the voice and joins the on-going MCPTT
group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is on-going group call. MCPTT client 1 is the current talker and
therefore the floor arbitrator.
Figure 10.6.3.6-1: Immediate group call announcement to join an ongoing group
call
1\. MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the on-going MCPTT group call.
2\. The entry of MCPTT client 4 is detected by the current participants.
3\. Since MCPTT client 1 is the current talker (floor arbitrator), MCPTT
client 1 immediately sends the group call announcement with the call
parameters to the group.
4\. MCPTT client 4 may send a response message.
5\. MCPTT client 4 sets the parameters for the group call.
6\. All participants are now considered part of the on-going group call.
#### 10.6.3.7 Group call release due to inactivity
If the on-going MCPTT group call is inactive for a specific duration, the
participating MCPTT clients release the MCPTT group call by themselves.
NOTE: Inactivity time can be set according to the policy of MCPTT service
provider.
#### 10.6.3.8 Broadcast group call
Group call on group-broadcast group and user-broadcast group are handled
without distinction in off-network.
Figure 10 6.3.8.1-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for broadcast
group call in off-network.
Figure 10.6.3.8.1-1: Broadcast group call in off-network
1\. An authorized MCPTT client 1 initiates broadcast group call setup as
described in subclause 10.6.3.3. The group call announcement message includes
the indication of broadcast group call.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 initiating broadcast group call starts to transmit
media.
NOTE: Other clients of group member are not allowed to transmit media in
broadcast group call.
3\. The broadcast group call is released as described in subclause 10.6.3.7.
#### 10.6.3.9 Emergency and imminent peril procedures
##### 10.6.3.9.1 Emergency group call
The off-network emergency group call is a special case of off-network (non-
emergency) group call as defined in subclauses 10.6.3.2, 10.6.3.3, 10.6.3.4,
10.6.3.5, 10.6.3.6 and 10.6.3.7. The following are modifications to the
aforementioned subclauses to support MCPTT emergency group calls:
\- As a pre-condition, the client initiating the emergency call has previously
been provisioned with an MCPTT group designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
The MCPTT client initiates MCPTT emergency group calls on this group.
Alternatively, the MCPTT client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the selected MCPTT group.
\- The group call announcement contains an indication that the MCPTT group
call is to be an MCPTT emergency call regardless of whether or not the MCPTT
client is in call. Group call participants learn of the MCPTT group in-
progress emergency condition from the indication.
\- Every call initiated by the MCPTT client will be an emergency call while
the MCPTT client is in MCPTT emergency state.
\- The MCPTT client enters the MCPTT emergency state when initiating an MCPTT
emergency call. Only the MCPTT user of the MCPTT client can clear the
client\'s local MCPTT emergency state.
\- The MCPTT group in-progress emergency state is cancelled when the call
ends.
\- The MCPTT user who initiated an emergency call, or upgraded a group call to
an emergency call, or an authorized user, may cancel the in-progress emergency
state with an MCPTT emergency group cancel message. The message is sent to the
call participants.
\- When the MCPTT group is no longer in the in-progress emergency state, every
client returns its default value of Prose Per Packet Priority.
\- An MCPTT group call in-progress is upgraded to an emergency group call when
the periodic group call announcement contains the emergency indicator.
\- The value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to emergency
state of MCPTT group call.
\- An MCPTT group call becoming an emergency group call does not affect the
state of other MCPTT call(s) in the client.
\- The MCPTT group remains in the in-progress emergency state until emergency
group the call ends or the in-progress emergency state is cancelled.
##### 10.6.3.9.2 MCPTT imminent peril
The off-network imminent peril group call is a special case of off-network
(non-imminent peril) group call as defined in subclauses 10.6.3.2, 10.6.3.3,
10.6.3.4, 10.6.3.5, 10.6.3.6 and 10.6.3.7. The following are modifications to
the aforementioned subclauses to support MCPTT imminent peril calls:
\- As a pre-condition, the user initiating the imminent peril call has
previously an MCPTT group to be used as the MCPTT imminent peril group. The
MCPTT client initiates MCPTT imminent peril group calls on this group.
\- The group call announcement contains an indication that the MCPTT group
call is to be an MCPTT imminent peril call. Group call participants learn of
the MCPTT group in-progress imminent peril condition from the indication.
\- The MCPTT group in-progress imminent peril state is considered cancelled
when the call ends.
\- The originating MCPTT user of the in-progress imminent peril or an
authorized user may cancel the in-progress imminent peril state with an MCPTT
imminent peril group cancel. The message is sent to the call participants.
\- When the MCPTT in-progress imminent peril is no longer in the in-progress
imminent peril state, every MCPTT client returns its bearer to the priority it
had prior to the in-progress imminent peril state.
\- An MCPTT upgrade to imminent peril call is used to upgrade an MCPTT group
call already in progress. The message is sent to all call participants so that
they are aware of the in-progress imminent peril.
\- The bearer is upgraded by all participants for the MCPTT group call already
in progress when the MCPTT group call is upgraded to in-progress imminent
peril state.
\- An MCPTT imminent peril call puts the MCPTT group into the in-progress
imminent peril state.
##### 10.6.3.9.3 MCPTT emergency alert
###### 10.6.3.9.3.1 MCPTT emergency alert initiation
An MCPTT client initiates an MCPTT emergency alert to the members of an MCPTT
group. This procedure will place the MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency state
if the MCPTT client is not already in that state.
Procedures in figure 10.6.3.9.3.1-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT emergency alert with an
MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The pre-conditions for off-network group calls as described in subclause
10.6.3.3 apply.
2\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
NOTE 1: Alternatively, MCPTT client 1 could have been provisioned for
emergency behaviour on the currently selected group.
3\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 belong to and are ready for off-network
communications on the MCPTT group.
Figure 10.6.3.9.3.1-1: MCPTT emergency alert
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency alert by
sending an MCPTT emergency alert announcement to the other clients. MCPTT
client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained
by the MCPTT client until explicitly cancelled. Once MCPTT client1 is in the
MCPTT emergency state, any calls initiated by MCPTT client 1, group or
private, shall be initiated as emergency calls and receive priority treatment.
The MCPTT emergency alert announcement is sent periodically so that late
joining MCPTT group members are notified.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency alert announcement to the other
participants on the MCPTT emergency group.
NOTE 2: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
MCPTT emergency call does not put the group into the in-progress emergency
condition.
3\. MCPTT users are notified of the MCPTT emergency state of the originating
MCPTT user.
4\. The receiving MCPTT clients acknowledge the MCPTT emergency alert to the
originating MCPTT client.
NOTE 3: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
emergency call does not put the group into the in-progress emergency
condition.
NOTE 4: The MCPTT client 1 need not initiate a group call. For example, the
MCPTT client can be configured to only allow alerts or the MCPTT user can
choose not to make an MCPTT emergency group call.
NOTE 5: MCPTT clients receiving subsequent MCPTT emergency alert announcements
that are sent periodically need only respond to the first one that they
receive.
5\. The originating MCPTT client 1 checks the responses and may inform the
MCPTT user of the MCPTT group members whose MCPTTT clients responded.
###### 10.6.3.9.3.2 MCPTT emergency state cancel
An MCPTT client has initiated an MCPTT emergency alert, has entered the MCPTT
emergency state and wishes to cancel this state, informing the other MCPTT
group members of the cancellation. As part of this process, the MCPTT client
may also request the cancellation of the in-progress emergency condition in
the group if authorized to do so.
Procedures in figure 10.6.3.9.3.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an MCPTT emergency state with an
MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT client 1 had previously successfully initiated an MCPTT
emergency alert.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 is still in the MCPTT emergency state.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT clients 2 and 3 are still in off-
network contact via the MCPTT group designated provisioned to MCPTT client 1
as the MCPTT emergency group.
Figure 10.6.3.9.3.2-1 MCPTT emergency state cancel
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency state cancel.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency state cancel announcement to the
MCPTT group to which MCPTT client 1 had previously sent the emergency alert.
3\. MCPTT users are notified of the MCPTT emergency cancellation by MCPTT
client 1.
4\. The receiving MCPTT clients acknowledge the MCPTT emergency state cancel
to the originating MCPTT client.
NOTE: MCPTT clients that track the MCPTT emergency alerts of other MCPTT
users, e.g. consoles that fail to receive subsequent periodic MCPTT emergency
alert announcements after a configured timeout can consider the alert to be
cancelled.
## 10.7 Private call
### 10.7.1 General
Private calls are enabled in both on-network and off-network.
Private calls can be setup in two different commencement modes, automatic
commencement mode and manual commencement mode.
Private calls in on-network can be with or without floor control. Private
calls in off-network are with floor control.

#### 10.7.2.2 Private call within one MCPTT system
##### 10.7.2.2.1 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call for communicating with another MCPTT user, with or without floor
control enabled, in an automatic commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.2.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of MCPTT private call
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call; or
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to automatic commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.2.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode-- MCPTT
users in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call for
the chosen MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor control is
to be established.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server (via SIP core) using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228
[5] for MCPTT, for establishing a private call with the chosen MCPTT user. The
MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT id of invited user, an SDP offer
containing one or more media types. For a private call with floor control, the
MCPTT private call request also contains an element that indicates that MCPTT
client 1 is requesting the floor. The MCPTT client 1 may include a Requested
commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in
automatic commencement mode if automatic commencement mode is requested by the
initiating user.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized
to initiate the private call, and that MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is
authorized to receive the private call. If the MCPTT private call request
requested automatic commencement mode then the MCPTT server also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a private
call in automatic commencement mode.
5\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 5 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 9.
6\. If authorized, MCPTT server includes information that it communicates
using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes the requested
automatic commencement mode indication based on a requested automatic
commencement mode by the calling user or based upon the setting of the called
MCPTT client and sends the corresponding MCPTT private call request towards
the MCPTT client 2, including the MCPTT ID of the calling MCPTT user 1. If the
called MCPTT user has registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs
and has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls, then the
incoming MCPTT private call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT
UE.
7\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private
call.
8\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an MCPTT private call response is sent to the MCPTT server (via SIP core).
9\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client
1 about successful call establishment.
10\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 have successfully established media
plane for communication and either user can transmit media. For successful
call establishment for private call with floor control request from MCPTT
client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the floor
control server, giving it permission to transmit. At the same time floor
participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by the floor control server that
floor is taken.
##### 10.7.2.2.2 Private call setup in manual commencement mode
###### 10.7.2.2.2.1 Description
Figure 10.7.2.2.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client
initiating an MCPTT private call that uses manual commencement mode. The flow
may use a floor request in the MCPTT private call request indicating that the
originator will be given the floor when the call starts and eliminates the
need for a separate initial floor request message during media plane
establishment. Alternatively the call initiation may be sent without the floor
request, which allows the called party to request the floor first.
###### 10.7.2.2.2.2 Procedure
Both clients are served by the primary MCPTT service provider in figure
10.7.2.2.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected manual commencement mode or has not
specified a commencement mode for the call; and
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to manual commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.2.2.2-1: MCPTT private call in manual commencement mode-- MCPTT
users in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are both registered and their respective
users, MCPTT user 1 and MCPTT user 2, are authenticated and authorized to use
the MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call
for the selected MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor
control is to be established. For private call without floor control, both
users will have the ability to transmit without floor arbitration.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request addressed to the MCPTT
ID of MCPTT user 2 using an MCPTT service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS
23.228 [5] (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the MCPTT
server). The MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID of invited user
and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The MCPTT private call
request may also contain a data element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is
requesting the floor, for a private call with floor control. The MCPTT client
1 may include a requested commencement mode that indicates that the call is to
be established in manual commencement mode if manual commencement mode is
requested by the initiating user.
4\. The MCPTT server confirms that both MCPTT users are authorized for the
private call. The MCPTT server checks the commencement mode setting of the
called MCPTT client and also checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1
is authorized to initiate a call in manual commencement mode.
5\. The MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT
service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained
in the initial received request and sends an MCPTT private call request for
the call to MCPTT client 2, including the MCPTT ID of the calling MCPTT user
1. If the called MCPTT user has registered to the MCPTT service with multiple
MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls,
then the incoming MCPTT private call request is delivered only to the
designated MCPTT UE.
6\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 7b.
7a. The MCPTT user is alerted. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT ringing to the
MCPTT server.
7b. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1, indicating that
MCPTT client 2 is being alerted.
8\. MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call using manual commencement mode (i.e.,
has taken some action to accept via the user interface) which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server. If MCPTT
user 2 has not accepted the incoming call, the MCPTT client 2 sends a call
failure response to the MCPTT server without adding reason for call failure.
9\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client 1
indicating that MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call, including the accepted
media parameters.
10\. The media plane for communication is established. Either user can
transmit media individually when using floor control. For of successful call
establishment for private call with floor request from MCPTT client 1, the
floor participant associated with MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor
initially. At the same time the floor participant associated with MCPTT client
2 is informed that the floor is taken. The meaning of the floor request (give
floor initially to originator [client 1], or give floor initially to target
[client 2]) may be configurable. For a private call without floor control both
users are allowed to transmit simultaneously.
##### 10.7.2.2.3 Private call release
###### 10.7.2.2.3.1 Client initiated
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is requesting to
release an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) and the
call established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or
automatic).
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.2.3.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating the release of an ongoing MCPTT
private call.
Figure 10.7.2.2.3.1-1: Private call release -- client initiated
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service and are involved in private
call with or without floor control established either in manual or automatic
commencement mode, as described in subclause 10.7.2.2.1 and subclause
10.7.2.2.2.
2\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to release an ongoing MCPTT private call
with MCPTT client 2.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call end request towards the MCPTT server
(via SIP core), for tearing down the private call with the other client.
4\. MCPTT server sends the corresponding MCPTT call end request towards the
MCPTT client specified in the original MCPTT call end request.
5\. MCPTT user is notified about the release of the private call.
6\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 acknowledges the MCPTT call end request.
7\. After receiving the MCPTT call end request acknowledgement from MCPTT
client 2, the MCPTT server generates an acknowledgement for the MCPTT client
1\'s MCPTT call end request.
8\. MCPTT clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with floor control, floor
control resources are released and MCPTT clients cannot make further requests
for floor control or send media.
###### 10.7.2.2.3.2 Server initiated
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server is terminating an
ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) and the call
established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic),
upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCPTT administrator configured maximum
duration for MCPTT private calls has expired or timed out due to MCPTT private
call without transmission/reception.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.2.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT
private call.
Figure 10.7.2.2.3.2-1: End private call -- server initiated
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service and are involved in private
call with or without floor control established either in manual or automatic
commencement mode.
2\. Upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCPTT administrator configured
maximum duration for MCPTT private calls has expired or timed out due to MCPTT
private call without transmission/reception, the MCPTT server decides to
initiate termination of an ongoing MCPTT private call between MCPTT client 1
and MCPTT client 2.
3\. MCPTT server sends an MCPTT call end request towards the MCPTT clients 1
and 2 (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call between them.
4\. MCPTT users at client 1 and client 2 are notified about the termination of
the private call.
5\. The MCPTT call end request receiving MCPTT clients 1 and 2 acknowledge the
request with OK.
6\. MCPTT clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with floor control, floor
control resources are released and MCPTT clients cannot make further requests
for floor control or send media.
#### 10.7.2.3 Private call within several MCPTT systems
##### 10.7.2.3.1 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode -- MCPTT
users in multiple MCPTT systems
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call (automatic commencement mode) for communicating with MCPTT user
in another MCPTT system with or without floor control enabled.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.3.1-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT client
initiating establishment of MCPTT private call with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call; or
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to automatic commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.3.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode \--
users in multiple MCPTT systems
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service to their respective MCPTT
service provider, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call
for the chosen MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor
control is to be established.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the home MCPTT
server 1 (via SIP core) using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS
23.228 [5] for MCPTT, for establishing private call with the MCPTT client 2
registered at MCPTT service provider 2. The MCPTT private call request
contains the MCPTT id of invited user and an SDP offer containing one or more
media types. For a private call with floor control, the MCPTT private call
request also contains an element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is
requesting the floor. The MCPTT client 1 may include a requested commencement
mode that indicates that the call is to be established in automatic
commencement mode if automatic commencement mode is requested by the
initiating user.
4\. MCPTT server 1 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call. If the MCPTT private call request
requested automatic commencement mode then the MCPTT server 1 also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a call in
automatic commencement mode.
5\. MCPTT server 1 may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 5 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 11.
6\. If authorized, MCPTT server 1 includes information that it communicates
using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes an automatic
commencement mode indication if automatic commencement mode was requested by
and authorised for the calling user and sends the corresponding MCPTT private
call request towards the MCPTT system (via SIP core) of the MCPTT client
specified in the original MCPTT private call request (MCPTT client 2) i.e.,
MCPTT server 2.
7\. MCPTT server 2 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is
authorized to receive a private call.
8\. MCPTT server 2 includes information that it communicates using MCPTT
service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained
in the initial received request, includes a requested automatic commencement
mode indication based on a requested automatic commencement mode by the
calling user or based upon the setting of the called MCPTT client and sends
the received MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT client specified in
the received MCPTT private call request (i.e., MCPTT client 2). If the called
MCPTT user has registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has
designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls, then the incoming
MCPTT private call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.
9\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private
call.
10\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an acknowledgement is sent to the MCPTT server 1 (via SIP core and MCPTT
server 2).
11\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, MCPTT client 1 is informed about
successful call establishment.
12\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 have successfully established media
plane for communication and either user can transmit media. For successful
call establishment of a private call with implicit floor control request from
MCPTT client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the
floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1, giving it permission to
transmit. At the same time floor participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by
the floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1 that the floor is taken.
##### 10.7.2.3.2 Private call setup in manual commencement mode -- MCPTT users
in multiple MCPTT systems
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call (manual commencement mode) for communicating with MCPTT user in
another MCPTT system with or without floor control enabled.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.3.2-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT client
initiating establishment of MCPTT private call with the selected MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected manual commencement mode or has not
specified a commencement mode for the call; and
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to manual commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.3.2-1: Private call setup in manual commencement mode -- users
in multiple MCPTT systems
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service to their respective MCPTT
service provider, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call
for the selected MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor
control is to be established.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the home MCPTT
server 1 (via SIP core), for establishing private call with the MCPTT client 2
registered at MCPTT service provider 2. For a private call with floor control,
the MCPTT private call request contains an element that indicates that MCPTT
client 1 is requesting the floor. The MCPTT client 1 may include a requested
commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in manual
commencement mode if manual commencement mode is requested by the initiating
user.
4\. MCPTT server 1 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call. The MCPTT server 1 also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a call in
manual commencement mode.
5\. If authorized, MCPTT server 1 sends the corresponding MCPTT private call
request towards the MCPTT system (via SIP core) of the MCPTT client specified
in the original MCPTT private call request (MCPTT client 2) i.e., MCPTT server
2.
6\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 10.
7\. The MCPTT server 2 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is
authorized to receive a private call and also checks the commencement mode
setting of MCPTT client 2.
8\. The MCPTT server 2 offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request and sends an MCPTT private
call request towards the MCPTT client specified in the received MCPTT private
call request (i.e., MCPTT client 2). If the called MCPTT user has registered
to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE
for receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCPTT private call request
is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.
9\. The MCPTT user is alerted. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT ringing to the
MCPTT server 1 (via server 2).
10\. The MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1, indicating
that MCPTT client 2 is being alerted.
11\. MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call using manual commencement mode (i.e.
has taken some action to accept via the user interface) which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server 1 (via SIP
core and MCPTT server 2)
12\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, MCPTT client 1 is informed about
successful call establishment.
13\. MCPTT client 1 and client 2 have successfully established media plane for
communication and either user can transmit media. For successful call
establishment of a private call with implicit floor control request from MCPTT
client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor by the
floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1, giving it permission to
transmit. At the same time floor participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by
the floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1 that the floor is taken.
##### 10.7.2.3.3 Private call release -- MCPTT users in multiple MCPTT systems
The procedure in this subclause is for the case where an MCPTT client is
requesting to release an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor
control) established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or
automatic), and the MCPTT users are in multiple MCPTT systems.
Procedures are similar to those described for private call release when MCPTT
users are in single MCPTT system as in subclause 10.7.2.2.3.1, with the
addition that the MCPTT call end request and the corresponding acknowledgement
are routed through the MCPTT server in partner MCPTT system.
#### 10.7.2.4 MCPTT emergency private call
##### 10.7.2.4.1 MCPTT emergency private call commencement
This procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is
initiating an MCPTT emergency private call with unicast signalling for
communicating with another MCPTT user. An MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency
state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCPTT user\'s mission
critical applications.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.4.1-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT emergency private
call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the MCPTT private call belong to the same MCPTT system.
2\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been configured to send an MCPTT
emergency alert prior to initiating an MCPTT emergency private call.
Figure 10.7.2.4.1-1 MCPTT emergency private call
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency private call.
MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is
retained until explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency private call request towards the
MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. The
MCPTT server records the identity of the MCPTT user that initiated the MCPTT
emergency private call until the MCPTT emergency is cancelled. If the MCPTT
client is configured to send an MCPTT emergency alert when initiating an MCPTT
emergency private call, the request also contains an indication that an MCPTT
emergency alert is to be initiated.
3\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency private call request towards the
target MCPTT client. The request contains an indication of the in-progress
emergency. The request contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if
the request from the originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
4\. The MCPTT user on MCPTT client 2 is notified of the incoming MCPTT
emergency private call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client acknowledges the MCPTT emergency private call
request to the MCPTT server.
6\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer.
7\. The MCPTT server informs MCPTT client 1 about the successful MCPTT
emergency private call establishment.
8\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 establish the media plane for
communication. The MCPTT client 1 can override MCPTT client 2 unless MCPTT
client 2 is also in the MCPTT emergency state.
NOTE 1: The priority for the MCPTT emergency private call is retained until
cancelled according to system policy (e.g. timeout or call end) or cancelled
by an authorized MCPTT user.
NOTE 2: The initiating MCPTT user\'s MCPTT emergency state is retained by the
system until cancelled as in subclause 10.6.2.6.1.3. The initiating MCPTT
user\'s MCPTT emergency state is also retained locally by the MCPTT client
until explicitly cancelled by the MCPTT user.
##### 10.7.2.4.2 MCPTT private call emergency upgrade
This procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading
a private call to an MCPTT emergency private call while the private call is
already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.4.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the MCPTT
client upgrading a private call to an MCPTT emergency private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the private call belong to the same MCPTT system.
2\. A private call is already in progress.
Figure 10.7.2.4.2-1: MCPTT private call upgrade
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an emergency. MCPTT client 1
sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state is retained until
explicitly cancelled.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the private call to
in-progress emergency by sending an MCPTT emergency request. If configured to
send an MCPTT alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency upgrade, the request
also contains an indication that an MCPTT alert is to be initiated. The
request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
3\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency request towards the MCPTT client of
the other participant.
4\. The MCPTT user is notified of the in-progress emergency of the MCPTT
emergency private call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client acknowledges the MCPTT emergency request to the
MCPTT server.
6\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for both
participants in the private call. The priority is retained until the call
ends.
7\. The MCPTT server confirms the upgrade request to MCPTT client 1. If the
MCPTT emergency request contained an implicit floor request, the OK message
contains the result of the implicit floor request.
8\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 continue with the private call, which
has been transformed into an MCPTT emergency private call. The MCPTT client 1
can override MCPTT client 2 unless MCPTT client 2 is also in the MCPTT
emergency state.

#### 10.7.3.2 Use of ProSe capability for private call
When an MCPTT user using a ProSe-enabled UE wants to communicate with a
specific MCPTT user using a ProSe-enabled UE by a ProSe mechanism, the MCPTT
client retrieves the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID of the target
MCPTT user from the \"List of user(s) who can be called in private call\" in
the MCPTT user profile and requests the IP address of the MCPTT UE associated
with the target MCPTT user from the ProSe layer.
The MCPTT client enables the ProSe layer to determine the and IP address for
the target MCPTT UE by providing the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID
(as defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [8]) of the target MCPTT user.
This may trigger the ProSe layer procedure (e.g. discovery). The user info ID
of the target MCPTT user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as
defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [8]).
The ProSe capability will then provide the layer-2 ID and IP address related
to the target MCPTT user\'s MCPTT ID to the MCPTT client.
NOTE: The ProSe procedures for one-to-one direct communications specified in
TS 23.303 retrieves a layer-2 ID associated with the user info ID of the
target MCPTT user by the discovery procedure to establish direct
communications between ProSe users.
#### 10.7.3.3 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call for communicating with another MCPTT user when off-network using
an automatic commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 10.7.3.3-1 are the basic signalling procedures for the
MCPTT client initiating establishment of an off-network MCPTT private call
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT user profile used for off-network operation mode is pre-provisioned
in the MCPTT UEs.

NOTE: Step 4 can also occur prior to step 3.
5\. The MCPTT client 1 and the MCPTT client 2 release all associated media
plane resources.
#### 10.7.3.6 MCPTT emergency private call
The off-network emergency private call is a special case of off-network
private call as defined in subclause 10.7.3. The following are modifications
to the aforementioned subclause to support MCPTT private calls:
\- The call setup contains an indication that the MCPTT private call is to be
an MCPTT emergency private call,
\- the bearers of both MCPTT private call participants are given MCPTT
emergency priority prior to media transfer,
\- either participant in an MCPTT private call may upgrade the call to the
MCPTT emergency state during the call by sending an MCPTT upgrade private
emergency request,
\- placing an MCPTT emergency private call places the MCPTT client in the
MCPTT emergency state,
\- the bearer priority of each participant is restored to the priority as it
was prior to the MCPTT emergency private call initiation, when the call ends
or when the MCPTT emergency priority is cancelled
\- an authorized user or the originator of the call may cancel the MCPTT
emergency priority of the call by sending an MCPTT cancel private emergency
request and
\- the MCPTT emergency priority of the MCPTT private call may be cancelled
when criteria established by the MCPTT Administrator are met (e.g., timeout).
## 10.8 Simultaneous session for MCPTT call
### 10.8.1 General
The simultaneous session for MCPTT call is functionality where the MCPTT
client can receive the media from multiple MCPTT calls over the same SIP
session and media bearer(s) between the MCPTT client and the MCPTT server.
An MCPTT client becomes involved in simultaneous session for MCPTT calls by
inviting, joining or accepting more than one MCPTT call, or affiliating to a
group.
NOTE: An MCPTT client affiliating to multiple MCPTT groups with active calls
will result in the MCPTT client being invited simultaneously to multiple MCPTT
calls.
The MCPTT client can also still handle multiple MCPTT calls in parallel at the
same time i.e. using multiple dialogs.
The simultaneous session is established during either an originating on-demand
call establishment or during pre-established session establishment or a
modification of an already established pre-established session or on-demand
call.
It is possible to change the prioritisation while the MCPTT client is engaged
in multiple MCPTT calls. The setting of the priority can be made at MCPTT call
setup or by performing a modification after the MCPTT call is established.
This may result in more than one media bearer.
## 10.9 Floor control
### 10.9.1 Floor control for on-network MCPTT service
#### 10.9.1.1 General
The procedure is for providing a floor control to MCPTT UE in an on-network
case and applies for both private call and group call. Floor control is
performed by using floor control information flows between the floor
participant and the floor control server.
#### 10.9.1.2 Information flows for floor control for on-network
##### 10.9.1.2.1 General
When the floor control server receives a floor request from the floor
participant, it decides whether to give a grant or not based on, e.g., the
session status (i.e., whether the grant is given to another user or not), user
profile, priority. The result is informed to the requesting floor participant.
When the floor participant receives a floor granted message, it can send voice
media over the uplink bearer established beforehand. The floor revoked message
can be used as part of override. The floor queue status request can be used to
know current position in the queue for floor.
Some floor control information flows can also piggyback call control
information flows to provide efficient call setup and clearing:
\- Call setup request is optionally carried in floor request (uplink) or floor
taken (downlink, can be broadcast); and
\- Call release request is optionally carried in floor release (uplink) or
floor idle (downlink, can be broadcast).
##### 10.9.1.2.2 Floor request
Table 10.9.1.2.2-1 describes the information flow floor request, from the
floor participant to the floor control server and from the floor control
server to the floor control server, which is used to request the floor for
media transfer. This information flow is sent in unicast to the floor control
server.

##### 10.9.1.3.1 Floor request, floor granted and floor taken during an MCPTT
session
Figure 10.9.1.3.1-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor
participant and the floor control server. Only two UEs involved in the session
are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A and client B)
and MCPTT server.
Figure 10.9.1.3.1-1: Floor request, floor granted, floor taken during an MCPTT
session
1\. The floor control is established between the floor participants and floor
control server. It is assumed that the floor is now in idle status.
2\. Floor participant A wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to floor control server
which includes floor priority and other information as necessary.
4\. Floor control server makes the determination on what action (grant, deny,
or queue) to take on the request based on criteria (e.g., floor priority,
participant type) and determines to accept the floor request from floor
participant A. The floor control server may limit the time a user talks (hold
the floor) as allowed by the configuration.
5a. Floor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor
participant A including the maximum floor granted duration e.g., if no other
floor participant has the permission for transmission.
5b. Floor control server sends a floor taken message to the other floor
participant (floor participant B) including information about who is granted
the floor.
6a. The floor granted shall cause the user of UE A where the floor participant
A is located to be notified.
6b. The receipt of the floor taken may be used to inform the user of UE B
where the floor participant B is located.
7\. Floor participant A starts sending voice media over the session
established beforehand.
NOTE: Voice media can continue to be sent while steps 8 through 11 occur.
8\. Suppose there are one or more users requesting to talk at this time, the
floor request(s) are queued as decided by floor control server e.g., based on
floor priority.
9\. Floor participant B sends a floor request message.

transmitting voice media.
2\. Floor participant A having a priority which is relatively higher than that
of floor participant B wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control
server.
4\. The floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor
participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the priority
information that is received in the floor request message. The floor control
server sends a floor revoked message to floor participant B stopping the voice
media transmission from floor participant B.
5\. The user of floor participant B may be notified that the floor is revoked.
6\. The Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor
participant A, while sending a floor taken message to floor participant B with
information of who is granted the floor.

session
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor
participants (with floor granted to floor participant B) and the floor control
server (with an override based on priority and configured to permit the
transmission of the overridden floor participant B to continue). Only two UEs
involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-conditions
  * The floor control server has been configured to support override.
  * The override supported in this case permits both the overridden floor participant and the overriding floor participant to be transmitting.

2\. Floor participant A having a floor priority which is relatively higher
than that of floor participant B wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control
server.
4\. The floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor
participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the floor
priority information that is received in the floor request message.
5a. Floor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor
participant A.
5b. Floor control server sends a floor taken message to the other floor
participants (including floor participant B). Floor participant B continues
transmitting the (overridden) voice media transmission.
NOTE 1: All other floor participants (not shown) that are part of this group
call receive a floor taken message, so that the other floor participants learn
who the newly granted talker (overriding) is.
6a. The floor granted causes the user of floor participant A to be notified.
6b. The user of floor participant B is notified of the status that the floor
is now taken by floor participant A.
7\. Floor participant A (overriding) starts sending voice media over the
session established beforehand.
NOTE 2: Floor participant B is still sending voice (overridden). The list of
floor participants that receive the overriding, overridden, or both
transmissions is based on configuration.
##### 10.9.1.3.3 Queue position during an MCPTT session
Figure 10.9.1.3.3-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between MCPTT clients
(with floor granted to floor participant B) and server (with an override based
on priority at floor control server). Only two UEs involved in the session are
shown for the simplicity.
Figure 10.9.1.3.3-1: Queue status during an MCPTT session
1\. It is assumed that floor participant B has been given a floor granted and
is transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants
(including floor participating A) requesting floor which get queued at the
floor control server.
2\. Floor participant A would like to know its current position in the floor
request queue.
3\. Floor participant A sends a queue position request message to the floor
control server.
4\. Floor control server determines the current queue position of floor
participant A from the floor request queue.
5\. Floor control server responds with the current position in queue position
info message.

##### 10.9.1.3.4 Floor request cancellation from the floor request queue
###### 10.9.1.3.4.1 Floor request cancellation from the queue -- MCPTT user
initiated
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.1-1 illustrates the procedure for floor request cancellation
from the floor queue initiated by the MCPTT user. The MCPTT user may be an
authorized user who has rights to cancel the floor requests of other MCPTT
users, whose floor requests are in floor control queue.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that floor participant B has been granted the floor and is
transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants
(including floor participant A and floor participant C) requesting the floor
which have been queued at the floor control server.
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.1-1: Floor request cancellation from queue initiated by
MCPTT user
1\. The floor participant A wants to remove the floor request from the floor
request queue. If floor participant A is an authorized MCPTT user with the
rights to cancel another MCPTT user\'s floor request, the authorized MCPTT
user may request floor request cancellation for one or more floor
participants, whose floor request needs to be removed from the floor queue.
2\. The floor participant A sends a floor request cancel (initiating MCPTT ID)
message to the floor control server. If the floor participant A wants to
remove the floor request(s) of other participant(s), the target
participant(s)\' MCPTT ID should be included in this message.
3\. The floor control server shall check whether the requesting floor
participant has authorization to cancel the floor request(s). If authorized,
the floor request(s) will be removed from the floor request queue. When
current transmission is completed, floor control server will process the floor
request from the updated floor request queue.
4\. If the floor request cancel in step 3 is sent by an authorized user (e.g.,
dispatcher) to cancel the floor request(s) of other participant(s) from the
floor request queue, the floor request cancel notify message is sent to the
floor participant whose floor request was cancelled from the floor queue.
5\. The floor control server provides a floor request cancel response to the
floor participant A when the floor cancellation is completed. Optionally, the
new queue position information may be notified to the floor participants whose
floor requests are in the floor request queue (not shown in the figure).
###### 10.9.1.3.4.2 Floor request cancellation from the queue - floor control
server initiated
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.2-1 illustrates the procedure for floor request cancellation
from the queue initiated by the floor control server. Only two UEs involved in
the session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that floor participant B has been granted the floor and is
transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants
(including floor participant A and participant C) requesting the floor which
have been queued at the floor control server.
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.2-1: Floor request cancellation from queue initiated by
floor control server
1\. The floor control server removes the floor request from the floor request
queue based on policy. e.g., expiration of a timer. In the case when floor
control server receives repeated floor requests from a floor participant while
the floor is occupied, the new floor request is accepted and added into the
floor queue and the existing/former floor request is removed from the floor
queue or the new floor request is rejected and the existing/former floor
request of this floor participant is retained in the floor request queue.
2\. The floor control server sends a floor request cancel notify to the floor
participant(s) whose floor request is removed from the floor request queue.
3\. Optionally, the newly queue position information is notified to the other
floor participants whose floor requests are queued.
#### 10.9.1.4 Floor control involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems
##### 10.9.1.4.1 Partner MCPTT system routes all floor control messages to
primary MCPTT system\'s floor control server
The MCPTT users belonging to different groups in multiple MCPTT systems will
participate in MCPTT media services (group communication, private calls, etc.)
in scenarios like group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group
regroup. In this service delivery model involving multiple groups from
different MCPTT systems, the floor control arbitration resides with the
primary MCPTT system. This is determined in the group call setup stage. The
MCPTT users of groups involved in the call session will transmit their floor
control messages through the partner MCPTT systems to which they belong. In
this scenario, the partner MCPTT systems request the floor control for its
MCPTT user(s) from the floor control server of the primary MCPTT system. The
protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like RTCP.
Figure 10.9.1.4.1-1 describes the procedure for floor control involving groups
from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share all information of their users\' to the primary MCPTT system (public
information would still need to be shared).
2\. The group 1 is hosted by primary MCPTT system and group 2 and 3 are hosted
by the partner MCPTT system.
3\. The floor participant 1 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 1. The
floor participant 2 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 2. The floor
participant 3 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 3. The floor control
server 1 belongs to primary MCPTT system. The floor control server 2 belongs
to partner MCPTT system.
4\. The floor control server 1 is the floor arbitrator of the MCPTT group
call. The floor control server 2 routes all floor control messages to and from
the floor participants 2 and 3 and then floor control server 1.
Figure 10.9.1.4.1-1: Floor control (partner MCPTT system forwarding) involving
groups from multiple MCPTT systems
1\. An MCPTT group call involving group1, group 2 and group 3 is setup and
active.
2\. The MCPTT users want to talk.
3\. The floor participants initiate a floor request to the floor control
server of their corresponding MCPTT systems. (The requests may or may not
occur at the same time).
4\. If only one floor request is received, or floor control server 2 handles
the floor request sequentially, there is no arbitration performed and the
corresponding floor request is forwarded to the floor control server 1. If the
floor control server 2 receives multiple floor requests at the same time or
during an interval, then it forwards the floor requests to the floor control
server 1 (floor arbitrator for the MCPTT group call). As the floor participant
information shall not be exposed, the floor priority related information
or/and group information to be used by floor control server 1 should be
included in the forwarded request.
5\. The floor control server 1 performs floor arbitration for the MCPTT group
call and determines the floor request to be accepted.
6\. If the floor request from floor participant 2 of the partner MCPTT system
is accepted, a floor granted is sent with permission to talk. The floor
control messages from floor control server 1 are routed to floor participant 2
via the floor control server 2.
7\. When the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor granted, the
floor control server 2 sends a floor granted message on to floor participant
2.
8\. The floor granted shall cause the user of the UE where the floor
participant 2 is located to be notified.
9\. The primary floor control server 1 may (9a.1) send a floor rejected
message, or (9b.1) send a queue position info message for each non-granted
received floor requests forwarded from the floor control server 2 (partner).
When the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor rejected message,
then the floor control server 2 (partner) (9a.2) sends a floor rejected
message to the appropriate floor participant. When the floor control server 2
(partner) receives the queue position info, then the floor control server 2
(partner) (9b.2) sends a queue position info message to the appropriate floor
participant.
10a.1 If floor control server 1 rejects the floor request from floor
participant 1, then a floor reject message is sent.
10a.2 Upon this being received the user of the UE where floor participant 1 is
located may be notified.
10b.1 If floor control server 1 supports floor queue, queue position info
message is sent to the floor participant 1.
10b.2 Upon this being received the user of the UE where floor participant 1 is
located may be notified.
NOTE 1: Steps 10a.1 through 10.b2 are optional as indicated by the dashed box
enclosing them. However if this box is implemented then either information
flow 10a or 10b would occur.
11\. Since the floor is granted to floor participant 2 of the partner MCPTT
system, then a floor taken is sent to all other floor participants ((11a)
floor participant 1 and (11b.1) to floor control server 2 (partner) for
forwarding to (11b.2) floor participant 3.
12\. The receipt of the floor taken may be used to inform the users of the UEs
where the floor participant entity 1 and floor participant 3 are located to be
notified.
13\. Upon successful floor granted, the group call media transmission occurs.
NOTE 2: The media flow between the media gateways of primary and partner MCPTT
systems have not been depicted in the figure for clarity.
##### 10.9.1.4.2 Partner MCPTT system performs filtering of floor control
messages entering and leaving the partner MCPTT system
The MCPTT users belonging to different groups in multiple MCPTT systems will
participate in MCPTT media services (group communication, private calls, etc.)
in scenarios like group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group
regroup. In this service delivery model involving multiple groups from
different MCPTT systems, the floor control arbitration resides with the
primary MCPTT system. This is determined in the group call setup stage. The
MCPTT users of groups involved in the call session will transmit their floor
control messages through the partner MCPTT systems to which they belong. In
this scenario, the partner MCPTT system filters its MCPTT users\' floor
requests before communicating with the floor control server of the primary
MCPTT system. The protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like
RTCP.
Figure 10.9.1.4.2-1 describes the procedure for floor control involving groups
from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share all information of their users to the primary MCPTT system (public
information would still need to be shared).
2\. The group 1 is hosted by primary MCPTT system and group 2 and 3 are hosted
by the partner MCPTT system.
3\. The floor participant 1 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 1. The
floor participant 2 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 2. The floor
participant 3 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 3. The floor control
server 1 belongs to primary MCPTT system. The floor control server 2 belongs
to partner MCPTT system.
4\. The floor control server 1 is the floor arbitrator of the MCPTT group
call. The floor control server 2 does floor control filtering with its floor
participants 2 and 3 before communicating with the floor control server 1.
Figure 10.9.1.4.2-1: Floor control (filtering by partner MCPTT system)
involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems
1\. An MCPTT group call involving group 1, group 2 and group 3 is setup and
active.
2\. The MCPTT users want to talk
3\. The floor participants initiate a floor request to the floor control
server of their corresponding MCPTT systems. (The requests may or may not
occur at the same time).
4\. Floor control server 2 receives a floor request from floor participant 2
and from participant 3 at the same time or during an interval, then the floor
control server 2 (partner) performs filtering of the floor requests received
according to its local policy such as priority or order based on its own
users, and forwards the selected floor request (floor participant 2) to the
floor control server 1 (floor arbitrator for the MCPTT group call). As the
floor participant information shall not be exposed, the priority related
information or/and group information to be used by floor control server 1
should be included in the forwarded request.
5\. The floor control server 2 (partner) may send a floor rejected towards the
floor participant 3, since its floor request was not chosen to be forwarded on
to the floor control server 1.
6\. The user on the UE where the floor participant 3 is located may be
notified of the rejection.
NOTE 1: Steps 5 and 6 can occur any time between step 4 and step 16.
7\. The floor control server 2 (partner) forwards the floor request of floor
participant 2 to the floor server 1.
8\. The floor control server 1 performs floor arbitration for the MCPTT group
call and determines the floor request to be accepted. The floor request
message from floor participant 2 of the partner system is accepted by the
floor control server 1 (arbitrator) and is determined that a floor granted is
sent with permission to talk.
9\. The floor granted message from floor control server 1 is routed to floor
participant 2 via the floor control server 2 (partner).
10\. Since floor participant 1 sent a floor request but was not granted,
10a.1 the primary floor control server may send a floor rejected message to
floor participant 1.
10a.2 The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified of the rejection.
10b.1 if floor control server supports floor queuing, send a queue position
info message to floor participant 1.
10b.2 The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified of the queue position.
NOTE 2: Steps 10a.1 through 10.b2 are optional as indicated by the dashed box
enclosing them. However if this box is implemented then either information
flow 10a or 10b would occur.
11\. A floor taken message is sent to floor participant 1.
12\. The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified.
NOTE 3: Step 10 through Step 12 can occur any time between step 8 and step 18.
13\. Since the floor control server 2 (partner) filters floor requests, when
the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor granted for floor
participant 2 from floor control server 1, the floor control server 2
(partner) needs to use the information received to generate the floor taken
which will be sent to all other floor participants (floor control participant
3).
14\. The floor control server 2 (partner) sends a floor granted message to
floor participant 2.
15\. The user of the UE where the floor participant 2 is located is notified.
16\. The floor control server 2 (partner) sends a floor taken message to all
other floor participants (floor participant 3).
17\. The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified.
18\. Upon successful floor grant, the group call media transmission occurs.
NOTE 4: The media flow between the media gateways of primary and partner MCPTT
systems have not been depicted in the figure for clarity.
### 10.9.2 Floor control for off-network MCPTT service
#### 10.9.2.1 General
The procedures defined in this subclause provide floor control to MCPTT UEs in
off-network operation. The procedures apply to both private calls and group
calls.
In off-network, floor control is performed by using floor control messages
among the MCPTT clients without centralized MCPTT server. The MCPTT client can
transmit voice packets once it is granted the right to speak, either locally
in the UE or by reception of a floor granted message from another MCPTT
client.
In off-network, the MCPTT client currently speaking performs the temporary
floor arbitrator during speaking since there is no centralized MCPTT floor
control server. The floor arbitrator controls the floor whether or not queue
is supported, and when floor is requested with override. If queue is
supported, the MCPTT client performing floor arbitrator grants the right to
speak to the next speaker and transfers the floor arbitrator role after
completing the voice transfer and releasing the floor. For group calls, the
floor arbitrator also transfers the floor control queue when granting the
floor. The next MCPTT client receiving the right to speak becomes the new
floor arbitrator and, for group calls, has the floor control queue.
For group calls, the floor control message is delivered in multicast based
communication and can be monitored by all the members within the MCPTT group.
The following information flows apply among MCPTT clients.
\- Floor request (from the floor participants to the floor arbitrator): used
to request a floor for voice transfer.
\- Floor release (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participants): used
to inform that the voice transfer is completed and the floor is released.
\- Floor granted (from the floor arbitrator to a floor participant): used to
indicate that the request for floor is granted, that voice transfer is
possible and the current queue list.
\- Queue position request (from the floor participant to the floor
arbitrator): used to request the position in the floor request queue.
\- Queue position info (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant):
used to indicate the floor request is queued and the current queue status.
\- Floor rejected (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used
to indicate that a request for the floor is rejected.
\- Floor taken (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used to
indicate the floor is granted to another MCPTT user.
#### 10.9.2.2 Information flows for floor control for off-network
##### 10.9.2.2.1 General
For floor control for off-network, the information flows defined under
subclause 10.9.1.2 apply unless it is explicitly defined under this subclause.
##### 10.9.2.2.2 Floor granted
Table 10.9.2.2.2-1 describes the information flow floor granted, from the
floor participant to the floor participant, which is used to indicate that a
request for floor is granted and media transfer is possible.
Table 10.9.2.2.2-1: Floor granted

participant is required
* * *
#### 10.9.2.3 Floor control during silence
##### 10.9.2.3.1 Successful floor taken (No floor contention)
If a floor arbitrator still exists, the expected behaviour for floor requests
during periods of silence is described in subclauses 10.9.2.5 and 10.9.2.6
(with the exception that no media was being generated prior to the floor
request).
If a floor arbitrator does not exist, figure 10.9.2.3.1-1 shows the successful
high level floor control procedure during periods **when there is no
detectable talker**.
NOTE 1: The description also applies to private calls.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group call had been established and all MCPTT clients have
the call parameters. No participant is currently talking and no floor
arbitrator is identified.
Figure 10.9.2.3.1-1: Successful floor taken flow (No floor contention)
1\. The MCPTT client 1 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 does not detect any floor contention. Floor contention
occurs when multiple floor requests may exist simultaneously.
NOTE 2: The mechanism for detecting floor contention is out of scope of the
present document.
3\. The MCPTT client 1 sends the floor taken message to the MCPTT group.
4\. The user gets a notification that the floor request was successful (the
floor has been granted).
5\. The MCPTT client 1 begins voice transmission.
#### 10.9.2.4 Simultaneous floor requests
#### 10.9.2.5 Floor request during speaking with queue
Figure 10.9.2.5-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. In the case,
MCPTT clients should support queue function. The current speaking MCPTT client
acting as the floor arbitrator put the floor request into the queue list when
receiving the floor request from other MCPTT clients. This procedure happens
while voice media is transmitting. In the flow, MCPTT client 1 transmits the
voice media to the MCPTT group and acts as the floor arbitrator.
NOTE: The description only applies to group calls.
Figure 10.9.2.5-1: Floor request during speaking with queue
1\. MCPTT client 1 is transmitting voice media to the MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
3\. MCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator put the floor request of
MCPTT client 2 into the queue list.
4\. MCPTT client 1 sends the queue position info message with the queuing
status regarding the floor request of MCPTT client 2 in order to inform the
floor request is queued.
5\. MCPTT client 1 sends the floor granted message to the MCPTT group when
releasing the floor. The message contains the MCPTT ID to be granted to send
the voice media, and queue list, if any. MCPTT client 1 may include the
maximum duration that MCPTT client 2 transmits in the floor granted message.
6\. MCPTT client 2 sends the voice media when receiving the floor granted
message and being granted as next speaker in the floor granted message. In
addition, MCPTT client 2 becomes the floor arbitrator.
#### 10.9.2.6 Floor request during speaking without queue
Figure 10.9.2.6-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants. In the case, MCPTT clients do not support queue
function. The current speaking MCPTT client acting as the floor arbitrator
controls the floor request when receiving the floor request from other MCPTT
clients. This procedure happens while voice media is transmitting. In the
flow, MCPTT client 1 transmits the voice media to the MCPTT group and acts as
the floor arbitrator.
NOTE: The description also applies to private calls.
Figure 10.9.2.6-1: Floor request during speaking without queue
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator rejects the floor request
from MCPTT client 2 if no queue function is supported and sends the floor
rejected message to the MCPTT group.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends the floor release message to the MCPTT group when
releasing the floor, in order to indicate that MCPTT client 1 finishes to send
the voice media and releases the floor.
When the floor release message is transmitted, there are no voice media in the
MCPTT group until an MCPTT client requests the floor as described in subclause
10.9.2.3.
#### 10.9.2.7 Override
Figure 10.9.2.7-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. When the
currently speaking MCPTT floor participant receives the floor request message
from another floor participant who is authorized to revoke the active
transmission (e.g. higher hierarchy), the current speaking MCPTT floor
participant immediately stops sending the audio media and then grants the
permission to that authorized floor participant.
NOTE: The description also applies to private calls.
Pre-condition:
\- MCPTT client 1, who acts as the floor arbitrator, transmits the audio media
to the MCPTT group.
Figure 10.9.2.7-1: Floor request with override authorization
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message with override criteria
(e.g., priority level) to the MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator determines if the floor is
to be revoked based on override criteria. If this is the case, MCPTT client 1
revokes its right of the floor and stops sending the voice media immediately.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends the floor granted message to the MCPTT group. The
floor granted message contains the MCPTT ID to be granted, the floor and the
floor control queue (if supported). MCPTT client 1 may also include the
maximum duration that MCPTT client 2 can transmit voice in the floor granted
message.
MCPTT client2 who has revoked the floor is the new floor arbitrator and
transmits the audio media to the MCPTT group.
#### 10.9.2.8 Floor queue status
Figure 10.9.2.8-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. If the floor
control queueing is supported by the floor control mechanism, the current
speaking MCPTT group member who is acting as the floor arbitrator collects the
information about the queue status based on the received request(s) from the
MCPTT group participant(s). The current speaker can then share information
about the queue status of the MCPTT floor participant upon request.
NOTE: The description only applies to group calls.
Pre-condition:
\- MCPTT client 1, who acts as the floor arbitrator, transmits the audio media
to the MCPTT group.
Figure 10.9.2.8-1: Queue status request
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the queue position request message targeted to MCPTT
client 1 i.e. the floor arbitrator by broadcasting the message to the MCPTT
group to get its queue status.
2\. Since the queue function is assumed to be supported in this call flow,
MCPTT client 1 i.e. the floor arbitrator processes the queue position request
to find out the status of MCPTT client 1 in the queue.
3\. MCPTT client 1 constructs the queue position info message containing the
MCPTT client 2\'s queue status and sends it toward MCPTT client 2 by
broadcasting the message to the MCPTT group.
MCPTT client1 continues being the floor arbitrator and transmits the audio
media to the MCPTT group.
## 10.10 Use of MBMS transmission (on-network)
### 10.10.1 Information flows for MBMS Transmission
#### 10.10.1.1 MBMS bearer announcement
Table 10.10.1.1-1 describes the information flow MBMS bearer announcement from
the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client.
Table 10.10.1.1-1: MBMS bearer announcement

#### 10.10.1.2 MapGroupToBearer
Table 10.10.1.2-1 describes the information flow to associate a MCPTT group
call to a MBMS bearer. It is sent from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client.

#### 10.10.1.4 MBMS listening status report
Table 10.10.1.4-1 describes the information flow for the MBMS listening status
report from MCPTT client to MCPTT server for the decision the switching from
MBMS bearer to unicast bearer.
Table 10.10.1.4-1: MBMS listening status report

Information element Status Description MCPTT ID M The MCPTT ID of the MCPTT
user who wants to switch downlink media delivery from MBMS bearer to unicast
bearer. TMGI(s) M TMGI(s) information. MBMS listening status(s) M The MBMS
listening status per TMGI.
* * *
### 10.10.2 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
#### 10.10.2.1 General
In this scenario, the MCPTT server pre-establishes MBMS bearer(s) in certain
pre-configured areas before the initiation of the group communication session.
When a UE originates a request for group call for one of these areas, the pre-
established MBMS bearer(s) is used for the DL media transmission.
The following steps needs to be performed prior the start of the MCPTT group
call over pre-established MBMS bearer:
\- MBMS bearer(s) is Pre-established
\- Perform the announcement of the information of pre-established MBMS bearer
to the MCPTT clients
When these preparation steps have been done the MCPTT group call using MBMS
bearer can start. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can use
the pre-established MBMS bearer for distributing the media. The MBMS bearer
can be used by any group. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS bearer, the
bearer can be used to broadcast one or more group calls in parallel.
Both the media packets as well as the floor control messages to the receiving
users are sent on the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be
used for the floor control messages, due to different bearer characteristic
requirements.
#### 10.10.2.2 Procedure
The procedure figure 10.10.2.2-1 shows only one of the receiving users using
MBMS bearer. There might also be users in the same MCPTT group call that
receives the call on unicast bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- The participating users are already affiliated.
Figure 10.10.2.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
1a. The MCPTT server determines to activate MBMS bearer. The activation of the
MBMS bearer is done on MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468
[10]. This bearer will be used for the MCPTT media.
1b. optionally, the MCPTT server may also activate a MBMS bearer dedicated for
floor control signalling. The activation of the MBMS bearer is done on MB2-C
reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [10]. This bearer will be used
for the MCPTT floor control signaling.
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the activation of MBMS bearers is
implementation specific.
2a. The MCPTT server passes the MBMS bearer info as described in table
10.10.1.1-1 for the service description associated with the pre-established
MBMS bearer to the MCPTT UE. The MCPTT client obtains the TMGI, identifying
the MBMS bearer, from the service description.
2b. The MCPTT server may pass the MBMS bearer info as described in table
10.10.1.1-1 for the service description associated with the pre-established
floor control MBMS bearer to the MCPTT client. The MCPTT client obtains the
TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service description.
NOTE 2: Step 2a and Step 2b can be done in one MBMS bearer announcement
message.
3\. The MCPTT client stores the information associated with the TMGI(s). The
MCPTT client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to
activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the MCPTT UE.
4\. The MCPTT client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the MCPTT server that the MCPTT client is able to
receive media over MBMS, whereby the MCPTT server may decide to use the MBMS
bearer instead of unicast bearer for MCPTT calls.
NOTE 3: Step 4 is optional for the MCPTT UE on subsequent MBMS bearer
announcements.
5\. An MCPTT group call is established. When MCPTT server decide to use the
MBMS bearer for media transmission for this MCPTT group call, the procedure of
call connect and disconnect over MBMS as defined in subclause 10.10.4 is
triggered.
6\. As the MCPTT server transmits the media over the MBMS bearer, the media
packets are detected and delivered to the MCPTT client.
### 10.10.3 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
In this scenario depicted in figure 10.10.3-1, the MCPTT server uses a unicast
bearer for communication with the UE on the DL at the start of the group
communication session. When the MCPTT server decides to use an MBMS bearer for
the DL media transmission, the MCPTT server establishes an MBMS bearer using
the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [10]. The MCPTT server provides MBMS
service description information associated with MBMS bearer(s), obtained from
the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE starts using the MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL
media and stops using the unicast bearer for the DL media transmission.
NOTE 1: The MCPTT server logic for determining when to establish the new MBMS
delivery bearer is implementation specific. For example, the MCPTT server
could decide to establish the MBMS delivery based on the location of the UE\'s
that are a part of the group communication session.
Figure 10.10.3-1: Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
1\. An MCPTT group call is established.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT group call can be any types established by any procedure in
subclause 10.6.2.1.
2\. The downlink data is sent by unicast delivery.
3\. The MCPTT server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468
[10]. Service description associated with the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from
The BM-SC.
4\. The MCPTT server provides service description information associated with
the MBMS bearer to the UE. The MCPTT UE obtains the TMGI from the announcement
message.
5\. The MCPTT UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the TMGI,
while in the service area associated with the TMGI.
6\. The MCPTT UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS associated
with the TMGI.
7\. The MCPTT client notifies the MCPTT server that it is successfully
receiving the TMGI. MCPTT server stops sending media data over unicast way to
the MCPTT client.
8\. The MCPTT server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS
bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between
the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCPTT
group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the activated
MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer
broadcasting the call. The message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
NOTE 3: Step 8 can occur before step 7.
9\. MCPTT server sends the downlink media for the group call over the MBMS.
### 10.10.4 Call connect and disconnect over MBMS
#### 10.10.4.1 General
MBMS bearer can be used for MCPTT group calls. One MBMS bearer is not
permanently associated to one specific group or group call. Before sending
media packets of a group call over MBMS bearer, the MCPTT server shall send
the association information between group call and the MBMS bearer. The group
call setup procedure indicates the media stream within one MBMS bearer that is
used for the specific group call. When the group call over the MBMS bearer is
finished, this temporary association information of an MCPTT group call to
specific resources on a MBMS bearer is undone. The procedure in figure
10.10.4.2.1-1 requires that the group session is setup before the call start.
This eliminates the need for the receiving clients to continuously use a
unicast bearer. Prior to this the MBMS bearer is activated and announced to
the MCPTT clients.
#### 10.10.4.2 Procedure
##### 10.10.4.2.1 Call connect over MBMS
In figure 10.10.4.2.1-1 the MCPTT client 1 is the client that initiate an
MCPTT chat group call and also the transmitting client. MCPTT client 1 may,
but does not have to be in an MBMS service area. The MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 represents MCPTT clients receiving the MCPTT call over an MBMS
bearer. There may be other receiving clients both over unicast bearers and
over this or other MBMS bearer(s), however they are not illustrated in this
figure.
The same procedure as for chat group call can also be applied for pre-arranged
calls. However that requires that the pre-arranged sessions are already
active. If a pre-arranged group session is initiated the use of pre-
established sessions are required.
Pre-conditions:
  * All users participating in the MCPTT group call are already affiliated to the group.
  * All participating users have joined the group session.
Figure 10.10.4.2.1-1: Chat group call connect on MBMS bearer
1\. Activation and announcement of MBMS bearer availability.
NOTE 1: The procedure does not include the steps for MCPTT client location
reporting, or for MBMS capability information exchange.
2\. MCPTT client 1 initiate the MCPTT group call by sending an initial floor
request over a unicast bearer to the MCPTT server (reference point MCPTT-4).
3\. The MCPTT server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS
bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between
the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCPTT
group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the activated
MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer
broadcasting the call. The message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
NOTE 2: Step 3 can be deferred until step 5 and the MapGroupToBearer message
can then be included in the floor taken message.
4\. The MCPTT server grants the right to transmit for MCPTT client 1 and by
that sends a floor granted message to the MCPTT client 1. This message is sent
over a unicast bearer (reference point MCPTT-4).
5\. A floor taken message is sent from the MCPTT server to all receiving
users. This message includes the MCPTT ID of the transmitting MCPTT client as
well as the MCPTT group ID. The message is sent over a MBMS bearer to all
users that have previously been setup to receive calls over the MBMS bearer.
The message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
6\. The media is sent from MCPTT client 1 to the MCPTT server over unicast
bearer and from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 over
MBMS bearer.
NOTE 3: Additional floor request messages in the same call will not trigger
the MapGroupToBearer message to be sent.
##### 10.10.4.2.2 Call disconnect over MBMS
Figure 10.10.4.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure where an
UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCPTT server to the MCPTT clients
to indicate that the MCPTT group call is being dissociated from the MBMS
bearer.
Figure 10.10.4.2.2-1: Chat group call disconnect on MBMS bearer
1\. An MCPTT group call is ongoing; the media is broadcasted over MBMS bearer
to MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3.
2\. MCPTT server has determined to disconnect the call over the MBMS bearer
for the MCPTT clients
3\. An UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCPTT server to MCPTT
client 2, MCPTT client 3 and possibly to MCPTT client 1 (if in MBMS coverage
area) on MBMS bearer(s).
NOTE 4: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message can be sent as part of other
messages.
NOTE 5: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message and the MapGroupToBearer message can
be combined, to facilitate switching bearers in one signalling step, as
necessary.
### 10.10.5 Switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer
Figure 10.10.5-1 shows the procedure for service continuity when a UE is about
to move out of MBMS coverage by switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer.
Pre-conditions: - It is assumed that the MBMS bearer has been activated by
MCPTT server for downlink delivery.
Figure 10.10.5-1: Switching from MBMS delivery to unicast delivery
1\. The MCPTT UE detects that it suffers from bad MBMS bearer radio condition
for the corresponding MBMS service. The method to detect is implementation
specific.
2\. The MCPTT client notifies the MCPTT server that it suffers from bad MBMS
bearer radio condition for the corresponding MBMS service by sending the MBMS
listening status report.
3\. The MCPTT server sends the downlink data by unicast delivery to the MCPTT
client.
NOTE: The unicast bearer may be set up on demand after step 2 or before.
4\. During the switching, the MCPTT client simultaneously receives downlink
data through both unicast bearer and MBMS bearer. If there is no downlink data
to the MCPTT client, this step can be skipped.
5\. The MCPTT client ceases to receive the downlink data through MBMS bearer
but continues receiving data through unicast bearer.
## 10.11 MCPTT resource management (on-network)
### 10.11.1 General
The MCPTT server setup media bearers and may need to modify the bearers for an
already established MCPTT call or session (pre-established session or chat
group session). The MCPTT server may need to modify unicast media bearers
and/or multicast media bearers.
Media characteristics that may need to be modified include:
\- activation and deactivation of the bearer;
\- modification of the QoS characteristics of the bearer (e.g. bearer priority
adjustment); and
\- modification of GBR due to media codec change
NOTE: A group call can consist of both unicast and multicast bearers which can
all need modification due to the same event.
### 10.11.2 Request for unicast resources at session establishment
The procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are
requested at session establishment. If concurrent sessions are used the MCPTT
server may utilize the capability of resource sharing specified in 3GPP TS
23.203 [4]. Specifically the uplink bandwidth can be shared between most types
of MCPTT call. The request for resources is sent to the PCRF on the Rx
reference point and includes media type, bandwidth, priority and resource
sharing information.
The procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires
requests for network resources.
Procedures in figure 10.11.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
requesting resource at session establishment.
Pre-Conditions:
  * No EPS bearer is active with the same QCI/ARP combination
  * Normal call setup procedures applies
Figure 10.11.2-1: Resource request at session establishment
1\. MCPTT client sends a call/session establishment request.
2\. MCPTT server receives evaluates the need network resources and use of
media resource sharing.
3\. MCPTT server send a session progress request containing request for
resources. .
4\. PCC procedures (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [4]) initiated from SIP core
local inbound/outbound proxy over Rx.
5\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the call control
protocol request to the MCPTT client.
6\. The MCPTT client acknowledges the session progress request with an OK
message.
7\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the OK message to the
MCPTT server.
8\. The MCPTT call/session is established and resources have been allocated.
### 10.11.3 Request for modification of unicast resources
To modify unicast media bearers the MCPTT server shall send a bearer
modification request containing the parameters to be modified
(active/inactive, priority/QoS, codec) using the call control protocol via the
SIP core to the UE.
The following procedure focuses on the case where the MCPTT server is
upgrading an existing MCPTT call to an MCPTT emergency or imminent threat call
while the MCPTT call is already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.11.3-1 are the signalling procedures for the
modification of a unicast bearer when the MCPTT server is upgrading an
existing MCPTT call to an MCPTT emergency or imminent threat call while the
MCPTT call is already in progress:
Pre-conditions:
\- An MCPTT call is already in progress;
\- A unicast bearer is being used for the call;
\- A request has been made to upgrade the call to an MCPTT emergency or
imminent threat call.
Figure 10.11.3-1: Bearer modification request
1\. MCPTT server receives an event that triggers the need to modify the
priority of a unicast bearer (.e.g. a request to upgrade the existing MCPTT
call to an MCPTT emergency or imminent threat call).
2\. MCPTT server sends a session update request containing an indication of
the new priority of the unicast bearer.
3\. PCC procedures (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [4]) initiated from SIP core
local inbound/outbound proxy over Rx.
4\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the session update
request to the MCPTT client.
5\. The MCPTT client acknowledges the call control protocol request with an OK
message.
6\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the OK message to the
MCPTT server.
7\. The MCPTT call continues with the modified unicast bearer.
### 10.11.4 Management of multicast media bearers
To activate the multicast media bearers the MCPTT server shall use the
Activate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [10] with the MCPTT
server performing the GCS AS function.
To deactivate the multicast media bearers the MCPTT server shall use the
Deactivate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [10] with the
MCPTT server performing the GCS AS function.
To modify multicast media bearers the MCPTT server shall use the Modify MBMS
Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [10] with the MCPTT server
performing the GCS AS function.
### 10.11.5 Request for resources with shared priority
#### 10.11.5.1 General
An MCPTT server that supports simultaneous sessions may need to share a common
priority on the EPS bearer for several MCPTT group calls that may use
different priorities on the application level. This is achieved by including
information for priority sharing on the request of resources over Rx reference
point to PCRF. All sessions associated with the same priority sharing
information will be handled by one EPS bearer, which will have a priority
based on the highest requested priority among the sessions.
The use of the procedure defined in subclause 10.11.5.2 is dependent on
operator policy.
#### 10.11.5.2 Procedure
Pre-conditions:
\- All previous resource requests from the MCPTT have included a priority
sharing information.
Figure 10.11.5.2-1: Resource request including priority sharing information
1\. The MCPTT server decides based on a request from the MCPTT client that the
priority of an ongoing call must be adjusted. An example of this is when an
MCPTT group call is changed to an emergency call (see subclause 10.6.2.6.1.2).
2\. The MCPTT server requests a session update to the SIP core. This request
will contain information of priority sharing.
3\. The proxy function in the SIP core sends a request to the PCRF over Rx to
request for modified priority. The request will include the priority sharing
information over Rx.
4\. The PCRF acknowledges the request.
5\. PCC updates the bearer priority for the bearer that contains the SDFs
associated with the same priority sharing information. The priority is set to
highest priority (lowest ARP) among those SDFs. No additional bearer is
created. Also the default bearer priority is updated accordingly.
6\. The session update is forwarded to the MCPTT client.
NOTE 1: The procedure defined above requires a PCC enhancement and is subject
to implementation in EPC and IMS and can therefore only be used if supported
by EPC and IMS.
NOTE 2: If the EPC and IMS does not support the priority sharing from MCPTT
system, no shared priority treatment apply, and a new EPS bearer will be setup
based on QCI/ARP combination.
## 10.12 MCPTT media plane transmissions with partner MCPTT systems (on-
network)
The MCPTT user is able to receive MCPTT media services (e.g. group
communication, private calls) from partner MCPTT systems in normal and roaming
conditions. In this service delivery model, the media plane transmissions
between the MCPTT UE of the user and the partner MCPTT system can be achieved
directly or via the primary MCPTT system, selected by the PLMN operator\'s
policy. The protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like RTCP.

Figure 10.12-3: Media communication via primary MCPTT system
For media related signalling communication:
1\. An MCPTT user wants to talk.
2\. The floor participant corresponding to the MCPTT user sends a floor
request message to floor control server (partner MCPTT system) to get the
authorization and/or permission to talk.
3\. The floor control server (partner MCPTT system) performs the authorization
and arbitrates between requests that are in contention (i.e., floor control).
4\. If the floor control server (partner MCPTT system) allows the floor
participant to talk, a floor granted is provided with permission granted to
talk.
For media communication:
5\. The MCPTT client can now send uplink media data to the media distribution
function of the MCPTT server (partner MCPTT system).
6\. The media distribution function of the MCPTT server (partner MCPTT system)
has downlink media data to transfer.
7\. The media distribution function of the MCPTT server (partner MCPTT system)
transfers the downlink media to the MCPTT client of the MCPTT user.
## 10.13 Use of UE-to-network relay
### 10.13.1 UE-to-network relay service authorization
The MCPTT service shall support the capability for UE-to-network relay to
restrict the relayed group communication on a per group basis.
To meet the above requirement, ProSe (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [8]) can
be used with an appropriate relay service code as per the following:
\- To restrict connection from only the membership of allowed MCPTT groups,
UE-to-network relay UE is provisioned with relay service code(s) associated
with allowed MCPTT group(s). The UE-to-network relay performs the access
control as follows:
1) The UE broadcasts which MCPTT group(s) is/are authorized to connect to the
network over this UE-to-network relay by including the related relay service
code(s) in the UE-to-Network Relay Discovery Announcement message (as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [8]); or
2) The UE determines whether to respond to a remote UE's broadcasting message
by checking if the relay service code carried in the UE-to-Network Relay
Discovery Solicitation message is within the list of allowed relay service
codes.
\- To find a permitted UE-to-network relay, a remote UE is provisioned with
the relay service code(s) associated MCPTT group(s) which the MCPTT user
belongs to. The remote UE performs the UE-to-network relay selection as
follows:
1) The remote UE determines if it is allowed to connect to a particular UE-to-
network relay by checking whether the relay service code(s) associated with
its MCPTT group(s) is/are carried in UE-to-Network Relay Discovery
Announcement message (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [8]; or
2) The remote UE includes the relay service code(s) associated with its MCPTT
group(s) in Network Relay Discovery Solicitation message (as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.303 [8]).
### 10.13.2 UE-to-network relay MCPTT service
The ProSe UE-to-network relay provides a purely layer 3 IP data routing
service, when the remote UE loses the coverage of cellular network and the
MCPTT user on the remote UE requires to access the MCPTT service via a ProSe
UE-to-network relay.
The application layer signalling for the MCPTT user on a remote UE are
identical to the application layer signalling for the MCPTT user on an on
network UE.
## 10.14 Location information (on-network)
### 10.14.1 General
MCPTT client location information shall be provided by the MCPTT client to the
MCPTT server. The location information reporting triggers are based on the
location configuration. Different type of location information can be
provided.
### 10.14.2 Information flows for location information
#### 10.14.2.1 Location reporting configuration
Table 10.14.2.1-1 describes the information flow from the MCPTT server to the
MCPTT client for the location reporting configuration.

#### 10.14.2.4 Event-triggered location reporting procedure
The MCPTT server provides location reporting configuration to the MCPTT
clients, indicating what information the MCPTT server expects and what events
will trigger the sending of this information to the MCPTT server. The decision
to report location information can be triggered at the MCPTT client by
different conditions, e.g., the reception of the location reporting
configuration, initial registration, distance travelled, elapsed time, cell
change, MBMS SAI change, tracking area change, PLMN change, MCPTT call
initiation, or other types of events such as MCPTT emergency alert, MCPTT
emergency call or MCPTT imminent peril calls. The location report can include
information described in subclause 7.5.2.2 and other location information. If
no information element is contained in location reporting configuration, it
indicates a cancellation for location reporting.
Figure 10.14.2.4-1: Event-triggered location reporting procedure
  1. The MCPTT server sends location reporting configuration to the MCPTT client containing the initial configuration (or a subsequent update) for reporting the location of the MCPTT UE. If no information element is contained in location reporting configuration, it indicates a cancellation for location reporting, and then step 2-3 are not needed.
NOTE 1: The location reporting configuration information can be made part of
the MCPTT user profile, in which case the sending of the message is not
necessary for location reporting.
NOTE 2: Different MCPTT clients may be given different location reporting
criteria.
2\. A location reporting event occurs, triggering step 3.
3\. The MCPTT client sends a location information report to the MCPTT server,
containing location information identified by the MCPTT server and available
to the MCPTT client.
#### 10.14.2.5 On-demand location reporting procedure
The MCPTT server provides location reporting configuration to the MCPTT
clients, indicating what information the MCPTT server expects. Subsequently,
the MCPTT server can request a location report at any time by sending a
location information request, which will cause the client to immediately send
the location report. The location report can include information described in
subclause 7.5.2.2 and other location information.
Figure 10.14.2.5-1: On-demand location information reporting procedure
  1. The MCPTT server sends location reporting configuration to the MCPTT client containing the initial configuration (or a subsequent update) for reporting the location of the MCPTT UE.
NOTE 1: The location reporting configuration information may be made part of
the MCPTT user profile, in which case the sending of the message may not be
necessary.
NOTE 2: Different MCPTT clients may be given different location reporting
criteria.
2\. The MCPTT server sends a location information request.
3\. The MCPTT client immediately responds to the MCPTT server with a report
containing location information identified by the MCPTT server and available
to the MCPTT client.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Service continuity for MCPTT
# A.1 Service continuity between on-network MCPTT service and UE-to-network
relay MCPTT service
This annex describes how 3GPP TS 23.237 [6] mechanisms for IMS service
continuity can be used to provide service continuity between on-network MCPTT
service and UE-to-network relay MCPTT service.
Only the procedure for service continuity from on-network MCPTT service to UE-
to-network relay MCPTT service is described in figure A.1-1. The procedure for
service continuity in the opposite direction is identical.
Figure A.1-1: Service continuity from on-network to UE-to-network relay
As illustrated in figure A.1-1:
\- Initially UE-1 has a direct connection to the network (on-network MCPTT
service). It is registered with the SIP core and is engaged in a SIP session
with the MCPTT Application Server (solid lines SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure
A.1-1).
\- When UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network, or after
the connection to the network has been lost, UE-1 discovers a UE-to-network
relay (UE-R) and establishes a PC5 connection with UE-R. UE-1 registers with
the SIP core over the target access leg and enters UE-to-network relay MCPTT
service by transferring the media streams over the target leg (dashed lines
SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure A.1-1).
\- The SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity
Application Server (SCC AS) before and after the handover, as described in
3GPP TS 23.237 [6].
Depicted in figure A.1-2 is the call flow for service continuity when the UE
switches from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network MCPTT relay service.
Figure A.1-2 Service continuity when UE switches from on-network MCPTT service
to UE-to-network relay MCPTT service
0\. UE-1 has a direct connection to the network and is engaged in a SIP
session with the MCPTT AS (on-network MCPTT service). The SIP session is
anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity Application Server (SCC
AS) and a Session transfer Identifier (STI) is assigned for the anchored SIP
session, as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [6].
1\. UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network or has
completely lost it.
2\. UE-1 (in the role of remote UE) performs ProSe UE-to-network relay
discovery over PC5 and establishes a secure point-to-point link with the relay
(UE-R) over PC5. As part of this process the remote UE is mutually
authenticated at PC5 layer with either the relay or with the network as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [8]. In the process UE-1 is also assigned an IP
address/prefix by the relay.
NOTE 1: If step 2 is started after losing connection, the service interruption
can be noticeable to the user.
NOTE 2: Step 2 will be entirely described under in 3GPP TS 23.303 [8].
3: UE-1 registers with the SIP core over the UE-to-network relay leg.
4\. In order to transfer the media streams of the SIP session UE-1 sends an
INVITE message on the new access leg towards the SCC AS. The INVITE message
includes the STI identifying the session to be transferred. The SCC AS
identifies the session based on STI and updates the session over the remote
access leg i.e. towards the MCPTT AS.
5\. The procedure is completed when all media streams have been transferred on
the access leg relayed via UE-R. At this point UE-1 may deregister the on-
network leg if it still has direct network connection (not shown in the
figure).
NOTE 3: The procedure for service continuity is always completed with unicast
delivery on the target side. If MCPTT content is being distributed on the
target side in multicast mode, then switching from unicast to multicast
delivery is performed after completion of the service continuity procedure.
###### ## Annex B (normative): MCPTT related data
# B.1 General
This Annex provides the static data needed for configuration for the MCPTT
service, which belongs to one of the following categories:
\- UE configuration data, as specified in subclause B.2;
\- MCPTT user profile data, as specified in subclause B.3;
\- Group configuration data, as specified in subclause B.4;
\- Service configuration data, as specified in subclause B.5; and
\- Initial UE configuration data, as specified in subclause B.6.
For each item of data, a reference to the requirements from 3GPP TS 22.179 [2]
or a reference to the related subclause from the present document is given.
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both on-network and off-network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the UE, Group, User
and Service configuration data refers to the information that will be stored
against each UE, Group, User and Service. This means that the three separate
tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for
each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each
configuration data category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.179
[2] or the corresponding subclause from the present document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding piece of data.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MCPTT UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# B.2 UE configuration data
Data in tables B.2-1 and B.2-2 has to be known by the MCPTT UE after MCPTT
authorization. The CSC-4 reference point is used for configuration between the
configuration management server and the MCPTT UE when the UE is on-network.
Data in table B.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference
point. Table B.2-1 contains the UE configuration required to support the use
of off-network MCPTT service.

# B.3 MCPTT user profile data
The MCPTT user profile data is stored in the MCPTT user database. The
configuration management server is used to configure the MCPTT user profile
data to the MCPTT user database (CSC-13) and MCPTT UE (CSC-4). The MCPTT
server obtains the MCPTT user profile data from the MCPTT user database
(MCPTT-2).
Data in table B.3-1 and B.3-3 can be configured offline using the CSC-11
reference point. Tables B.3-1 and B.3-3 contain the UE configuration required
to support the use of off-network MCPTT service.

# B.4 Group configuration data
The group configuration data is stored in the group management server. The
group management server is used to configure the group configuration data to
the MCPTT UE (CSC-2) and the MCPTT server (CSC-3).
Data in table B.4-1 and B.4-3 can be configured offline using the CSC-12
reference point. Tables B.4-1 and B.4-3 contain the UE configuration required
to support the use of off-network MCPTT service.

# B.5 Service configuration data
The service configuration data is stored in the MCPTT server. The
configuration management server is used to configure the service configuration
data to the MCPTT server (CSC-5) and the MCPTT UE (CSC-4).
Data in tables B.5-1and B.5-3 can be configured offline using the CSC-11
reference point. Tables B.5-1 and B.5-3 describe the service configuration
data required to support the use of off-network MCPTT service.

# B.6 Initial UE configuration data
The initial UE configuration data is essential to the MCPTT UE to successfully
connect to the MCPTT system. Data in table B.6-1 is provided to the MCPTT
UE\'s clients (e.g. MCPTT client, group management client, configuration
management client, identity management client, key management client) during
the bootstrap process (see subclause 10.1.1) and can be configured on the
MCPTT UE offline using the CSC-11 reference point or via other means e.g. as
part of the MCPTT client\'s provisioning on the UE, using a device management
procedure.

###### ## Annex C (informative): Local UE settings for MCPTT
# C.1 Local UE settings for MCPTT
Table C.1-1 details local UE settings for MCPTT that represent important
functionalities that may be required by MCPTT UEs, however these
functionalities do not require central configuration like the parameters in
annex B, so these are detailed in this annex for information to UE vendors
interested in producing MCPTT UEs. The various columns in the tables have the
following meanings:
\- Reference: Is the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS
22.179 [2].
\- Definition: A short definition of the local UE setting.
