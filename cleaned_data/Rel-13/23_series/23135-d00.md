## 4.3 Messages and their contents
This clause contains the detailed description of the information flows used by
Multicall.
Each Information Element, IE, is marked as (M) Mandatory, (C) Conditional or
(O) Optional. A mandatory information element shall always be present. A
conditional information shall be present if certain conditions are fulfilled;
if those conditions are not fulfilled it shall be absent. An optional
information element may be present or absent, at the discretion of the
application at the sending entity. This categorisation is a functional
classification, i.e., stage 2 information and not a stage 3 classification to
be used for the protocol.
The stage 2 and stage 3 message and information element names are not
necessarily identical.
### 4.3.1 Messages between MS and MSC
Table 1 indicates messages between the MS and the MSC for mobile originating
calls and mobile terminating calls. (Refer to TS 24.008).
The MS shall indicate the maximum number of bearers supported by the MS in the
CC capabilities IE. The MS shall also indicate the maximum number of
simultaneous speech bearers supported by the MS for future compatibility. For
Release 99, the maximum number of simultaneous speech bearers is 1. If the MS
does not indicate the maximum number of bearers the network shall assume it
does not support Multicall.
The network supporting Multicall shall indicate the capability in the NW CC
capabilities IE. If the NW CC capabilities IE is not sent from the network,
the MS supporting Multicall shall assume that the network doesn't support
Multicall. If an MS initiating an emergency call is located in a network that
does not support Multicall, the MS shall release one or more existing call to
ensure that the emergency call can be established.

# 5 Network entity functions
The following SDL diagrams describe the procedures within individual network
entities for handling Multicall.
## 5.1 General
The MSC shall check whether the maximum number of bearers has been reached for
both MO and MT call. In counting of the current number of bearers for the
target subscriber, the following situations are counted as an active bearer.
  * Call in set-up.
  * Established call.
  * Call on hold.
  * Call on hold and established call on the same bearer.
  * Call on hold and MO call in Setup on the same bearer.
## 5.2 MO call
### 5.2.1 Functional requirements of serving MSC
Figure 8: Procedure Check_OG_Multicall_MSC.
This procedure is called when the MSC receives a Setup message from the MS.
After handover procedure completion to another MSC, N**~br~** _SN as defined
for the target MSC shall overwrite the previous N**~br~** _SN.
Figure 8: Procedure Check_OG_Multicall_MSC
### 5.2.2 Functional requirements of VLR
Figure 9: Procedure Check_OG_Multicall_VLR.
This procedure is called when the VLR receives a Send Info For Outgoing Call
message from the MSC.
{width="6.768055555555556in" height="8.539583333333333in"}
Figure 9: Procedure Check_OG_Multicall_VLR
## 5.3 MT call
### 5.3.1 Functional requirements of serving MSC
Figure 10: Procedure Check_MT_Multicall_MSC.
This procedure is called when the MSC receives a Page MS message or a Search
For MS message from the VLR. The maximum number of bearers (N**~br~**)
indicates the minimum value of N**~br~** _User, N**~br~** _SN and N**~br~**
_UE. After handover to another MSC is completed, N**~br~** _SN, as defined for
the target MSC, shall overwrite the previous N**~br~** _SN.
\"Call in Setup\" means that the MS is engaged in at least one call that has
not reached the established phase (called party answer).
The test \"Call waiting\" takes the \"Yes\" exit if a waiting call has been
offered to the subscriber but the outcome of offering the call has not been
determined.
Figure 11: Procedure Establish_Terminating_TCH_Multicall.
This procedure is called when the MSC receives a Call Confirmed or a Connect
message from the MS. If the MS indicates \"No bearer\" as the value of the
Stream Identifier in the Call Confirmed message the test \"Bearer allocation
pending\" takes the \"Yes\" exit.
Figure 12: Procedure MC_TCH_Check
This procedure is called when the MSC needs to establish a terminating TCH.

### 5.3.2 Functional requirements of VLR
Figure 13: Procedure Get_CW_Subscription_Info_Multicall_VLR.
This procedure is called when the VLR receives a Page MS negative response
message or a Search For MS negative response message with the negative
response IE set to \"Busy (More Calls Possible)\".

# 6 Interaction with telecommunication services
## 6.1 Speech
The Multicall supplementary service does not provide multiple traffic channels
for speech calls. Refer to Procedure Check_OG_Multicall_MSC and Procedure
Check_MT_Multicall_MSC.
If N**~br~** _UE is greater than N**~br~** _SN, the mobile station may
initiate an Emergency call even if N**~br~** _SN has been reached. When the
network receives an Emergency call Setup message from the mobile station:
\- if N**~br~** _SN has not been reached, the network shall accept it
regardless of N**~br~** _SB or N**~br~** _User;
\- if N**~br~** _SN has been reached, the network shall reject the emergency
call setup attempt. The MS shall release one or more existing calls and it
shall re-initiate an Emergency call.
The MS shall ensure that an emergency call Setup request is acceptable to a
serving network which does not support multicall, if necessary by releasing
one or more existing calls.
## 6.2 Short message service
No impact.
## 6.3 Facsimile service
The Multicall supplementary service provides multiple traffic channels for
facsimile service except for alternate speech and facsimile group 3.
## 6.4 Data circuit asynchronous
The Multicall supplementary service provides multiple traffic channels for
data circuit asynchronous.
## 6.5 Data circuit synchronous
The Multicall supplementary service provides multiple traffic channels for
data circuit synchronous.
## 6.6 Void
## 6.7 GPRS
No impact.
# 7 Interaction with other supplementary services
## 7.1 Line Identification services
No impact.
## 7.2 Call forwarding unconditional (CFU)
No impact.
## 7.3 Call forward on busy (CFB)
The condition NDUB occurs in accordance with the definition for multicall.
(See TS 22.135).
## 7.4 Call forwarding on no reply (CFNRy)
No impact.
## 7.5 Call forwarding on MS not reachable (CFNRc)
No impact.
## 7.6 Call Hold (CH)
No impact.
## 7.7 Call Waiting (CW)
Call Waiting SS will be invoked under the conditions described in TS 22.135.
## 7.8 Multiparty service (MPTY)
No impact.
## 7.9 Closed user group (CUG)
No impact.
## 7.10 Advice Of Charge (AoC)
No impact.
## 7.11 Call Barring services
No impact.
## 7.12 Explicit call transfer (ECT)
No impact.
## 7.13 Call Deflection (CD)
No impact.
## 7.14 Completion of calls to busy subscriber (CCBS)
The NDUB condition occurs in accordance with the definition for multicall.
(See 3GPP TS 22.135).
A subscriber provisioned with multicall is in the idle state when the
subscriber has no ongoing (active or held) calls. CCBS requests in the
destination B CCBS queue shall be processed if destination B is idle.
# 8 Interaction with network features
## 8.1 Customised Applications for Mobile network Enhanced Logic (CAMEL)
No impact.
## 8.2 Support of Optimal Routeing (SOR)
No impact.
## 8.3 Operator Determined Barring (ODB)
No impact.
# 9 Information stored in the HLR
The following logical states are applicable for Multicall (refer to TS 23.011
for an explanation of the notation):
* * *
**Provisioning State** **Registration State** **Activation State** **HLR
Induction State** (Not Provisioned, Not Applicable, Not Active, Not Induced)
(Provisioned, Registered, Active and Operative, Not Induced)
* * *
The HLR shall store:
\- The state of Multicall (which shall be one of the valid states listed
above) per subscriber.
\- The subscription option \"maximum number of bearers N**~br~** _SB\" per
subscriber:
\- This subscription option takes a value in the range (2 -- 7).
  * The subscription option "maximum number of bearers N**~br~** _User" per subscriber:
> \- This subscription option takes a value in the range (1 -- N**~br~** _SB).
# 10 State transition model
Figure 14 shows the successful cases of transition between the applicable
logical states of Multicall. The state changes are caused by actions of the
service provider.
Note that error cases are not shown in the diagram, as they normally do not
cause a state change. Additionally, some successful requests may not cause a
state change. Hence they are not shown in the diagram.
Figure 14: State transition model for Multicall
# 11 Transfer of information from HLR to VLR
If the provisioning state for Multicall is \"Provisioned\" then when the
subscriber registers on a VLR the HLR shall send that VLR information about
the logical state of Multicall, N**~br~_** User and N**~br~** _SB.
If the logical state of Multicall, the subscription options N**~br~** _SB or
N**~br~_** User are changed while a subscriber is registered on a VLR then the
HLR shall inform the VLR of the new logical state of Multicall, the new
N**~br~_** User or the new N**~br~** _SB.
# 12 Information stored in VLR
The VLR shall store the service state information, N**~br~** _SB and
N**~br~_** User as received from the HLR.
# 13 Handover
In the case that the network supports Multicall, it shall be possible to
handover multiple bearers (See TS 23.009).
