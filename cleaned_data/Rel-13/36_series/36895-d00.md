# 4 Background
ECC CEPT finalized the harmonised technical conditions in the band 694-790 MHz
including a SDL option from 738-758 MHz in blocks of 5 MHz which can be used
for mobile communication. The details can be found in the ECC Decision (15)01,
[4].
The objective of the WI is to:
1) Specify the band numbering and the UE/BS RF characteristics of the 700SDL-
band for E-UTRA.
\- E-UTRA channel bandwidths 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz
\- The European 700SDL-band is restricted to be used with CA
2) Specify the RAN4 core requirements for the support of E-UTRA Carrier
Aggregation between: LTE Advanced 2 Band Carrier Aggregation (2DL/1UL) of Band
20 and Band 67 (new European 700SDL band).
3) Evaluate co-existence between SDL and other 3GPP bands, as well as between
SDL and PPDR UL within 733-736 MHz.
4) Update the related technical specifications to include the 700SDL-band and
CA combinations.
5) Add conformance testing in RAN5 specifications (to follow at a later
stage).
The following table represents the BW that should be specified and supported.

# 5 Frequency band arrangements and regulatory background
CEPT ECC decided during its 39^th^ ECC Meeting in March 3 -6, 2015 to
harmonised the frequency band 694 -- 790 MHz. Following the resolution of CEPT
Report 53 [8] to the European Commission in response to a mandate on the 700
MHz range (694-790 MHz), the ECC has agreed, an equivalent CEPT-wide
harmonising decision on the use of 700 MHz for Mobile Fixed Communication
Networks (MFCN).
ITU WRC-12 decided to allocate the frequency range 694-790 MHz in Region 1 to
the mobile, except aeronautical mobile, service on a co-primary basis and
identified this band for IMT. The allocation will be effective immediately
after WRC-15 to be held in November 2015.
For frequency range 694 -- 790 MHz CEPT has identified a channel arrangement
for MFCN including FDD with 703 -- 733 MHz for uplink, and 758 -- 788 MHz for
downlink (2 x 30 MHz). These frequency ranges are on the lower duplexer of APT
700 MHz band plan (Band 28), which will provide economies of scale and maximum
inter-regional harmonisation.
ECC decision includes also the allocation of the range 738 - 758 MHz for
optional unpaired frequency SDL while not preventing the use of the band for
other services depending on national circumstances [8]. An unpaired frequency
arrangement (SDL) on optional basis may use up to four of the following 5 MHz
frequency blocks: 738 -- 743 MHz, 743 -- 748 MHz, 748 -- 753 MHz and 753 --
758 MHz.

lower duplexer Band 28 and 700SDL
{width="6.677083333333333in" height="1.3333333333333333in"}
The MFCN Base Station (BS) block edge mask (BEM) for the range 738 - 758 MHz
for optional unpaired frequency SDL consists of several elements of in-block
power limits and the out-of-block limits. An out-of-block element consists of
a baseline level and transitional levels enabling filter roll-off from in-
block to baseline levels.
**Based on [4] to obtain a BS BEM for a specific block in the paired DL or SDL
spectrum, the BEM elements that are defined in Table 5-2 are used as
follows:**
\- **In-block power limit is used for the block assigned to the operator.**
**\- Transitional regions are determined, and corresponding power limits are
used. The transitional regions may overlap with guard bands and adjacent
bands, in which case transitional power limits are used. Transitional
requirements do not apply in MFCN UL spectrum.**
**\- For remaining spectrum assigned to MFCN UL and DL (including SDL
spectrum, if applicable), for DTT spectrum below 694 MHz and for spectrum
allocated to MFCN above 790 MHz, baseline power limits are used.**
**\- For remaining guard band spectrum (i.e. not covered by transitional
regions) guard band power limits are used.**
**\- For spectrum between 733 and 758 MHz not used by MFCN (including SDL),
duplex gap requirements apply.**
**\- Less stringent technical parameters may be agreed on a bilateral or
multilateral basis for the operation of MFCN in the 694-790 MHz band,
providing that they comply with the technical conditions applicable for the
protection of other services, applications or networks and with cross-border
obligations.**

The ECC decision mentions other optional elements for the use of the duplex
gap of the MFCN FDD 2x 30 MHz In particular; compatibility between PPDR within
733-736/788-791MHz and SDL has been studied in CEPT Draft Report 239,
currently under public consultation [5].

# 7 General issues
## 7.1 Co-existence with PPDR UL 733-736MHz
### 7.1.1 BS co-existence
PPDR UL and SDL are separated by 2MHz. The Draft ECC Report 239 contains an
analysis on BS-BS co-existence and co-location between PPDR UL and SDL. Below,
the findings are summarised
Three scenarios are being analysed in this Draft Report:
**\- Scenario 1** : Fulfilment of the LRTC in ECC/DEC/(15)01
**\- Scenario 2:** Fulfilment of 3GPP requirements for coexistence or
colocation between PPDR and SDL
Scenario 1 only considers the feasibility of a SDL filter to fulfil the
regulatory requirements in ECC Decision (15)01 for protection of PPDR UL, i.e.
-52 dBm/3 MHz EIRP. The analysis assumes 15 dBi antenna gain and concludes
that it is possible to create such filters in the BS without the need of
external filter. The ECC Decision does not include any RX requirements and
thus the feasibility of PPDR UL was not done. However, it is recognized in the
report that such filter is needed for proper performance of PPDR.
Scenario 2 looks into BS-BS co-existence and BS-BS co-location from both PPDR
UL (blocking rejection) and SDL perspective (unwanted emissions). Figure
7.1.11 and- Figure 7.1.1-2 include filter simulations at room temperature for
BS-BS co-location from Draft ECC Report 239. The required filter rejection
characteristics also consider attenuation from the receiver chain to reflect a
realistic design. Figure 1 shows that the IL at the lowest frequencies of SDL
is close to 4dB, which will imply high performance degradation of the lowest
SDL frequencies. The IL across the PPDR UL filter is also high to be able to
reject a blocker from SDL with 1dB degradation.

Figure 7.1.1-2: PPDR UL filter simulations for colocation with SDL [9]
Figure 7.1.1-3 includes the PPDR UL filter performance, included in Draft ECC
Report 239. It shows that co-existence is easier while still implying high IL
in the PPDR UL.
{width="4.947916666666667in" height="2.4375in"}
Figure 7.1.1-3: PPDR UL filter simulations for coexistence with SDL
The Draft ECC Report 239concludes that coexistence is possible between SDL and
PPDR with 2 MHz offset and higher than standard insertion loss for PPDR Rx
filter more than 2 MHz separation between PPDR UL and SDL are needed to allow
for colocation. Further simulations show that 5 MHz or larger offset is
recommended.
Site solutions are also mentioned as a way to manage co-location.
### 7.1.2 UE **co-existence between** PPDR UL 733-736 MHz and SDL 738-758 MHz
A UE supporting PPDR within 733-736/788-791 MHz will most likely reuse the
Band 28 radios. Band 28 UL and SDL have some overlap and thus the emissions
from such a UE towards SDL are the spectrum emission mask requirements
specified in TS 36.101.
# 8 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
## 8.1 Co-existence studies
Table 8.1-1 shows the second and third order DL harmonics and intermodulation
products when two simultaneous DLs are active in Band 20 and 700MHz SDL.

* * *
It can be seen from Table 8.1-1 that 2^nd^ harmonics caused by BS supporting
carrier aggregation of Band 20 and Band 700MHz SDL may fall into the BS
receive band of Band 24, while 3^rd^ harmonic will fall into the BS receive
band of Band 40.
It can be seen from Table 8.1-1 that none 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 20 and 700MHz SDL will fall into the BS
receive band of currently defined 3GPP bands, while 3^rd^ IMD products may
fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 12-14, 17-20, 26-28, 30, 40
and 44. Bands 5, 6, 12-14, 17-19, 26-27, 30, 40 and 44 are not intended for
use in the same geographical area as Bands 20 and 700MHz SDL.
The analysis below gives further information on the actual channel bandwidths
and carrier positions for that CA combinations which can cause DESENSE to the
BS own receive blocks.
Assume that the 2 CC transmitted by the Band (20 + 700SDL) BS are _a_ and _b_
MHz channel bandwidth and _c_ and _d_ MHz from the edges of Bands 20 and
700SDL DL frequency bands as shown in Figure 8.1-1 below:
{width="6.500694444444444in" height="1.104861111111111in"}
Figure 8.1-1: CC transmitted by the Band (20 + 700SDL) BS
And the corresponding BS receive block are as shown in Figure 8.1-2 below:
{width="6.500694444444444in" height="1.0833333333333333in"}
Figure 8.1-2: CC received by the Band 20 BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 2 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 8.1-2 below:
Table 8.1-2: Band (20 + 700SDL) BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 8.1-2 with the BS receive blocks
in Figure 8.1-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in
the BS by transmitting of the 2 CC will only fall into the BS own receive
block of Band 20 under one of the transmit configurations shown in Table 8.1-3
below:

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified E-UTRA band, for
coexistence with protected bands.
NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the
lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be
set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2. The highest
frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range should be set at
the highest boundary of the frequency range minus MBW/2. MBW denotes the
measurement bandwidth defined for the protected band.
