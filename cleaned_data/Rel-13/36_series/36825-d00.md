# Introduction
Seven TDD UL/DL configurations have been supported in LTE TDD since Rel-8 to
address different DL and UL traffic ratios. The most DL heavy TDD UL/DL
configuration in current LTE TDD is configuration 5, where 8 DL subframes and
one DwPTS in a special subframe within a radio frame (i.e. 10 subframes) can
be used for DL transmission. There has been a proposal to introduce additional
configuration into LTE TDD, aiming to provide even more resources for DL
transmission.
There has not been any consensus on whether additional TDD configuration shall
be introduced for LTE TDD. To gain a better understanding on the issues
related to the potential introduction of additional configuration for LTE TDD,
this study item is proposed. This study item shall not provide any
recommendation on any follow-up normative work. Upon completion of this study
item, the follow-up actions shall be discussed on the PCG level.
TDD operation in unlicensed spectrum is out of the scope of this study.
# 1 Scope
The objective of the study is to evaluate issues related to the potential
introduction of the following additional configuration(s) for LTE TDD; 10:0:0
and 9:1:0 (DL:Sp:UL). This includes:
\- Identify the scenario(s), frequency band(s), and use cases(s) of the
possible additional TDD configuration(s)
\- Coexistence with adjacent standalone LTE TDD operations in the same band
\- To be compared with the coexistence between intra-band adjacent LTE TDD
operations using different UL/DL configurations
\- Evaluation of the potential benefits and drawbacks of the additional TDD
configuration(s) and possible solutions to mitigate the potential drawbacks
\- Any other relevant ecosystem aspect(s)
\- Compare the option of using 10:0:0 and/or 9:1:0 TDD configuration for a TDD
spectrum against the alternative of converting the TDD spectrum to FDD
supplemental DL spectrum
NOTE: The study shall not provide any recommendation on next steps / future
normative work.

# 4 Deployment scenarios of possible additional TDD configuration(s)
## 4.1 Scenario(s)
The following scenarios are of interests for operators who want to deploy
additional TDD configuration(s). In all of the following cases, the SCell is
operating the additional TDD configuration(s), and the PCell is operating FDD
or TDD using the existing TDD configuration(s).
\- Scenario 1a: Operator deploys macro cell operating as PCell on carrier
frequency _f_ ~0~ and macro cell operating as SCell on carrier frequency _f_
~1~ (co-located), e.g. CA scenario 2 or 3 in TS36.300 v12.4.0. The macro cell
on _f_ ~1~ uses the additional TDD configuration(s). Both of the two carriers
can be aggregated by UE.
\- Scenario 1b: Operator deploys macro cell operating as PCell on carrier
frequency _f_ ~0~ and macro cell as SCell on carrier frequency _f_ ~1~ (non-
collocated). Both of the two carriers can be aggregated by UE.
\- Scenario 2: Operator deploys macro cell operating as PCell on carrier
frequency _f_ ~0~ and small cell operating as SCell on carrier frequency _f_
~1~ (non-co-located), e.g., CA scenario 4 in TS36.300 v12.4.0. Both of the two
carriers can be aggregated by UE.
\- Scenario 3: Operator deploys small cell operating as PCell on carrier
frequency _f_ ~0~ and small cell as Scell on carrier frequency _f_ ~1~ (co-
located). Both of the two carriers can be aggregated by UE.
Based on the current specifications, inter-band carrier aggregation would be a
pre-requisite for a UE to receive data on the SCell operating the additional
TDD configuration(s).
# 5 Coexistence study with adjacent standalone TDD operations
## 5.1 Scenarios
The following scenarios are selected to evaluate coexistence on intra-band
adjacent LTE TDD operations using different TDD UL/DL configurations.
A. Scenarios:
i. Scenario 1:
1\. Operator_A: small cell (outdoor pico)
a. Carrier frequency: 2.7GHz
b. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
c. Duplex mode: New TDD UL/DL configuration (10:0:0)
2\. Operator_B: Macro cell
a. Carrier frequency: 2.7GHz
b. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
c. Duplex mode: TDD UL/DL configuration 2 with special configuration 4
ii. Scenario 2:
1\. Operator_A: Macro cell
a. Carrier frequency: 2.7GHz
b. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
c. Duplex mode: New TDD UL/DL configuration (10:0:0)
2\. Operator_B: Macro cell
a. Carrier frequency: 2.7GHz
b. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
c. Duplex mode: TDD UL/DL configuration 2 with special configuration 4
B. Evaluation methodology: Deterministic and Monte Carlo simulation to
evaluate impact to both Operator_A and Operator_B performance for both
scenarios.
C. Traffic model: Full buffer traffic
> Note: 2.7GHz was chosen based on average of all TDD frequency bands of
> interest. For the purpose of this TR, results for this carrier frequency are
> deemed to be applicable to all TDD bands.
## 5.2 Inter-operator coexistence aspects
Co-existence issues between operators on adjacent carriers in the same
geographical area are not expected at least for the following cases.
\- All operators on adjacent carriers use the same TDD UL-DL configurations
and the radio frame and subframe are time synchronized between the operators.
\- All operators on adjacent carriers only use the downlink subframes and/or
DwPTS, regardless of whether or not the radio frame and subframe are
synchronized among the operators. Under this assumption, the following options
for the TDD UL-DL configuration are considered for the operators:
\- 10:0:0 TDD UL-DL configuration
> \- Existing TDD UL-DL configuration or 9:1:0 TDD UL-DL configuration without
> any uplink transmission
\- Guard band is used between adjacent carriers of different operators.
NOTE: Usage of guard band is detrimental to spectrum efficiency.
## 5.3 Coexistence study results
### 5.3.1 Deterministic analysis
The deterministic analysis calculates the minimum required separation distance
between the aggressor eNB and the victim eNB.
A tight requirement is that the acceptable eNB-to-eNB interference level is
7dB below the thermal noise floor, i.e.
Note that the victim macro eNB noise figure is 5dB [Annex A].
A relax requirement is that the acceptable eNB-to-eNB interference level is
set according to the dynamic range requirement. For system bandwidth of 10MHz,
the acceptable eNB-to-eNB interference level is -79.5dBm with victim macro
eNB.

##### **Observations for Scenario 1:** {#observations-for-scenario-1 .H6}
\- The DL geometry of the pico network improves by about 3-4 dB if the Macro
network is using UL, compared to the baseline in which the Macro network is
using DL.
\- The Macro network sees about 5 dB degradation in the UL geometry when the
pico network is using DL.
##### **Observations for Scenario 2:** {#observations-for-scenario-2 .H6}
\- The DL geometry of Macro UEs of Operator A is almost the same irrespective
of the Macro network of Operator B is using UL or DL.
\- The UL geometry of Macro UEs of Operator B is significantly decreased if
the Macro network of Operator A is using DL, compared to the baseline in which
the Macro network of Operator A is using UL.
##### **Conclusion:** {#conclusion .H6}
\- From the study results, it is observed there is a coexistence issue of
deploying the new TDD UL/DL configuration 10:0:0/9:1:0 in a channel that is
adjacent to another channel that uses different TDD UL/DL configuration
without adopting any interference mitigation scheme.
\- In the evaluated scenarios, the observed BS-to-BS interference from pico
cell in the Macro-pico adjacent channel scenario is less than the BS-to-BS
interference from Macro cell in the Macro-Macro adjacent channel scenario.

For Band 42 and Band 43, the current 3GPP specification of TS 36.101 says that
when UEs supporting Band 42 and/or Band 43 receives the NS_22 from the eNB,
they shall meet the above requirement with 5 MHz offset from the both edges of
a channel bandwidth and general spectrum emission mask and UTRA ACLR 1 within
the adjacent 5 MHz region. In addition, it is allowed for the UEs to meet the
requirement to utilize up to 5 dB power back off (A-MPR) according to Table
6.2.4-17 specified in TS 36.101. Note that the requirement has not included
intra band contiguous CA case so far.
The above requirement was introduced to address UE-UE co-existence for Band
42&43 under the network where adjacent operators networks are not synchronized
and/or do not use the same UL/DL TD-LTE configuration each other.
From the above, time synchronization and/or the same UL/DL configuration usage
between operators are essential for TD-LTE operation.
# 6 Evaluation of possible additional TDD configuration(s)
## 6.1 Scenarios
**Performance Evaluation Set 1**
The purpose for this performance study is to evaluate throughput gain from
using the possible new LTE TDD configurations (10:0:0 and 9:1:0) in a scenario
where no adjacent channel interference is present (e.g. operators sharing the
same frequency band use same TDD UL/DL configuration).
A. Scenario:
i. Deployment scenario: SCE scenario 2a (from TR36.872)
ii. Throughput measurement: Downlink packet throughput
iii. PCell:
1\. Carrier frequency: 2.0GHz
2\. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
3\. Duplex mode: FDD
iv. SCell:
1\. Carrier frequency: 3.5GHz
2\. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
3\. Case 1: TDD UL/DL configuration #5 (8:1:1) with special configuration 4 as
baseline performance
4\. Case 2: New TDD UL/DL configuration (10:0:0)
B. Traffic model: High traffic load case (FTP traffic model)
C. Channel reciprocity and channel sounding error modelling are not applicable
to Case 2.
D. Ratio of CA and non-CA capable UEs: 1:1 and 1:0
E. Performance metric:
i. 5%, 50% and 95%-tile of packet throughput (aggregated between PCell and
SCell)
Note that, the performance gains from using the possible new TDD
configurations 10:0:0 and 9:1:0 are expected to be similar.
**Performance Evaluation Set 2**
The following scenarios are selected to evaluate throughput impact from using
the possible new LTE TDD configurations (10:0:0 and 9:1:0) in a scenario with
intra-band adjacent LTE TDD operations using different TDD UL/DL
configurations.
A. Scenarios:
i. Scenario 1:
1\. Operator_A: SCell: small cell (outdoor pico) (PCell is a standalone cell
on another frequency band)
a. Carrier frequency: 2.7GHz
b. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
c. Duplex mode:
\- Case 1: TDD UL/DL configuration 2 with special configuration 4
\- Case 2: TDD UL/DL configuration 5 with special configuration 4
\- Case 3: New TDD UL/DL configurations (10:0:0)
2\. Operator_B: Standalone Macro cell
a. Carrier frequency: 2.7GHz
b. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
c. Duplex mode: TDD UL/DL configuration 2 with special configuration 4
ii. Scenario 2:
1\. Operator_A: SCell: Macro cell (PCell is a standalone cell on another
frequency band)
a. Carrier frequency: 2.7GHz
b. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
c. Duplex mode:
\- Case 1: TDD UL/DL configuration 2 with special configuration 4
\- Case 2: TDD UL/DL configuration 5 with special configuration 4
\- Case 3: New TDD UL/DL configurations (10:0:0)
2\. Operator_B: Standalone Macro cell
a. Carrier frequency: 2.7GHz
b. Channel bandwidth: 10MHz
c. Duplex mode: TDD UL/DL configuration 2 with special configuration 4
B. Evaluation methodology: System level simulation to evaluate the performance
of Operator_A (in DL only) and Operator_B (in UL only) for both scenarios.
C. Traffic model: Non-full buffer model (High traffic load)
D. PCell is not modelled in the simulations.
Note that, the performance impact from using the possible new TDD
configurations 10:0:0 and 9:1:0 is expected to be similar.
## 6.2 Intra-operator synchronization aspects
For both the existing and new TDD UL-DL configurations, for an operator
deploying network on a carrier within a given TDD band, the base-stations of
the carrier need to be time synchronized irrespective of whether or not the
operator only uses the downlink subframes and DwPTS for downlink traffic on
the carrier, i.e., uplink transmission does not occur. If time synchronisation
within a single operator is not achieved, the current Cell phase
synchronization accuracy requriements are not met. Furthermore, the benefits
of advanced feature such as (F)eICIC, NAICS, MBSFN, small cell on/off with
discovery cannot be achieved.

\- Mobility aspects are not considered for all the evaluations.
It is observed from evaluation results that
\- For 4 small cells per macro cell:
\- One source shows that, when the ratio of CA and non-CA UEs is 1:1 and two
cells are available for an operator, a new TDD UL/DL configuration of 10:0
exhibits 50% UE throughput performance losses of -60.87% to -22.22% and
increased packet drop ratio over TDD UL/DL configuration 5.
\- The performance losses may be alleviated if more than two cells are
available for an operator.
\- Three sources show that, when the ratio of CA and non-CA UEs is 1:0, a new
TDD UL/DL configuration of 10:0 provides 50% UE throughput gains of 6.06% to
16.25% over TDD UL/DL configuration 5.
\- For 10 small cells per macro cel:
\- One source shows that, when the ratio of CA and non-CA UEs is 1:0, a new
TDD UL/DL configuration of 10:0 provides 50% UE throughput gains of 42.94%
over TDD UL/DL configuration 5.

**Observation:**
Based on the evaluation results in sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2, the following
observations can be made:
\- From five sources, for the macro-pico adjacent channel scenario, the uplink
performance of the macro network is degraded if the pico network uses a
downlink heavier UL/DL configuration than the macro network:
\- the 50% uplink packet throughput of the macro network is degraded by 14% --
51% if the macro network uses TDD configuration 2 and the pico network uses
TDD configuration 5;
\- the 50% uplink packet throughput of the macro network is degraded by 25% --
70% if the macro network uses TDD configuration 2 and the pico network uses
the new TDD configuration of 10:0:0.
\- From five sources, for the macro-pico adjacent channel scenario, the
downlink performance of the pico network is improved if the pico network uses
a UL/DL configuration with more DL subframes:
\- the 50% downlink packet throughput of the pico network is increased by 11%
-- 73% if the pico network uses TDD configuration 5 compared to configuration
2;
\- the 50% downlink packet throughput of the pico network is increased by 15%
-- 72% if the pico network uses the new TDD configuration of 10:0:0 compared
to configuration 2.
\- From three sources, for the macro-macro adjacent channel scenario, the
uplink performance of victim macro network is degraded if the aggressor macro
network uses a downlink heavier UL/DL configuration than the victim macro
network:
\- the 50% uplink packet throughput of the victim macro network is degraded by
50% -- 71% if the aggressor macro network uses TDD configuration 2 and the
victim macro network uses TDD configuration 5;
\- the 50% uplink packet throughput of the victim macro network is degraded by
76% -- 100% if the aggressor macro network uses TDD configuration 2 and the
victim macro network uses the new TDD configuration of 10:0:0.
\- From three sources, for the macro-macro adjacent channel scenario, the
downlink performance of the aggressor macro network is improved if the
aggressor macro network uses a UL/DL configuration with more DL subframes:
\- the 50% downlink packet throughput of the aggressor macro network is
increased by 14% -- 80% if the aggressor macro network uses TDD configuration
5 compared to configuration 2;
\- the 50% downlink packet throughput of the aggressor macro network is
increased by 28% -- 156% if the aggressor macro network uses the new TDD
configuration of 10:0:0 compared to configuration 2.
\- From the study results, for the non-full buffer traffic case, it is
observed there is a coexistence issue resulting in performance loss of
deploying the new TDD UL/DL configuration 10:0:0/9:1:0 in a channel that is
adjacent to another channel that uses different TDD UL/DL configuration
without adopting any interference mitigation scheme.
## 6.5 Possible solutions to mitigate potential drawbacks of the additional
TDD configuration(s)
This section describes possible solutions to mitigate potential drawbacks of
the additional TDD configuration(s) on a high level without detailed study. If
specified, the remaining details of the described methods would have to be
further clarified.
## 6.5.1 Co-existence
Operating LTE TDD with both DL and UL transmissions and LTE TDD with DL only
transmissions on adjacent carriers of the same frequency band could create co-
existence issues and thus, degrade the LTE TDD with DL/UL operations.
### 6.5.1.1 UE/eNB sensing
One technical solution for avoiding potential co-existence issues between LTE
TDD with DL only and LTE TDD with DL/UL operations on the same frequency band
without prior deployment knowledge in given region or country, would be a
sensing based method, which consists of the following 2 steps of sensing and
adapting:
1\. Sensing of adjacent carriers could be done using one or multiple of the
following alternatives:
1\. UEs supporting LTE TDD DL only configurations and indicated or configured
LTE TDD DL only cell for DL transmission (e.g. used with aggregated LTE FDD
PCell) could scan neighboring carrier frequencies of the same frequency band
to see if there are other LTE TDD cells deployed, which are using LTE TDD with
DL/UL operations. Whether or not such LTE TDD cells exist would be reported to
the network by the UE.
2\. eNBs intending to use LTE TDD with DL transmission could sense and detect
neighbor eNBs on adjacent carriers by measuring, e.g., PSS/SSS/CRS before
starting up and occasionally during operation.
2\. Having sensed adjacent carriers for neighboring LTE TDD cell one or
multiple of the following adaptations could be taken:
1\. After LTE TDD with DL/UL operations is reported to an eNB, the eNB would
automatically stop any LTE TDD DL only operations in the proximity of those
frequencies and frequency bands and geographical areas. In addition, the
mechanism could include for the UE to automatically stop or reject DL only
operations.
2\. If an eNB intending to use LTE TDD with DL only operations detects
neighbor eNB(s) it could adapt / lower its transmission power, e.g., on all
subframes or only on UL subframes of neighbor eNB(s) accordingly.
3\. If an eNB intending to use LTE TDD with DL only operations detects very
strong neighbor eNB(s) it could adopt the TDD configuration to the same UL/DL
configuration of the neighbor eNB. This scheme would result in less
specification impact than adapting / lowering its transmission power.
4\. If an eNB intending to use LTE TDD with DL only operations detects
neighbor eNB(s) it could reduce the impact on the neighbor's uplink by
improving the ACLR limit, at least in those TTIs which are assigned to the
uplink in the adjacent channel.
The detailed measurement/reporting frequency configured will impact to how
quickly and effectively a new TDD cell is detected on the neighboring
frequencies by the UE, and the complexity involved in the detection procedure.
Additionally, , the detection time and effectiveness are also dependent on the
number of UEs in the cell making measurements. The frequency for the
measurements is not concluded as part of the study. When a new TDD cell (not
using any of the new configurations) is activated in the victim network, it
may take time before being detected after activation. After that the aggressor
network is assumed to have knowledge for that location of the interference
issue (and thus as one option will not use either of the new
configurations).In the eNB/UE sensing method, in the condition that the eNB/UE
sensing mechanism detects potential co-existence situation (expressed as
detecting existing TDD configuration on the same frequencies and in the same
geographical area), then the new LTE TDD configuration, i.e. 10:0:0 and 9:1:0
(DL:Sp:UL), cannot be applied in the above mentioned option and thus the
performance benefit of the new LTE TDD configuration is not available.
In some scenarios, like rooftop eNB installations, there can be eNB to eNB
interference which may not be always detected by UE sensing but would need to
be complemented in such a scenario by eNB sensing.
Complexity analyses of UE based sensing solution:
This neighbor carrier scanning in the UE based sensing could be similar to the
current UE scanning used for PLMN selection.
\- In the PLMN selection the UE has to scan all RF channels in the E-UTRA
bands according to its capabilities to find available PLMNs and search for the
strongest cell on each carrier and read its system information for the PLMN
selection.
\- In these UE sensing mechanisms for co-existence between LTE TDD DL only and
LTE TDD DL/UL configurations the UE does not need to scan all the E-UTRA
bands. Instead only part of a given E-UTRA frequency band and potentially also
some LTE carriers outside the given frequency band would need to be scanned in
order to ensure that there are no LTE TDD DL/UL operations in neighboring
carriers to the carrier with LTE TDD DL only configuration is planned to be
activated. Carriers outside the given frequency band would only need to be
scanned if LTE TDD DL only operations are planned to be activated at the edge
of the band.
\- For the purposes of the new co-existence solutions the UE is not required
to read the system information of these scanned carrier frequencies like in
the PLMN selection but instead potentially more optimized detection for
detecting LTE TDD DL/UL deployment on adjacent carrier could be sufficient.
Naturally the detection could also be done by reading system information if
that is seen smaller effort and change from the UE implementation point of
view.
\- The current L1 hardware and algorithms are the basis of implementation for
the resulting new measurement assuming current RRM and ANR functionality could
be used in the UE. For UEs in connected mode the assumption is that PCell
needs to ensure that measurement gaps are provided.
\- As noted earlier the frequency of the measurements/reporting is not
concluded in the study (and will have impact on the final implementation
complexity)
The existing UEs are also required to be able to search for higher priority
PLMNs (or suitable PLMN) at regular time interval.
\- Similarly like regular higher priority PLMN search regular sensing and
detection of LTE TDD DL/UL operations in the neighboring channels of the
planned LTE TDD DL only SCell could be used for avoiding that LTE TDD DL only
operations would create co-existence issues to TDD DL/UL operations.
Additionally unlike in case of PLMN searches both the specification and LTE
PCell can provide additional information, which carrier frequencies on a given
frequency band or on its close proximity should be searched. This will further
reduce number of carriers considered for sensing compared to the existing PLMN
search support. The regular higher priority PLMN is defined by TS23.122.
The UE reporting of the sensing results to the active PCell can be similar to
normal UE reporting mechanisms defined in TS36.331, with one additional
measurement report needed to be provided by the UE for eNB.
Ensuring mandatory support and testability of necessary interference
mitigation solution(s) is a pre-requisite for specifying the new TDD
configurations 10:0:0/9:1:0 for LTE TDD.
### 6.5.1.2 Antenna downtilt
Base station antenna downtilt is used in network deployments to control inter-
cell co-channel interference. Antenna downtilt could further be used to
mitigate coexistence issues between LTE TDD cells with both DL and UL
transmissions and LTE TDD cells with DL only transmissions on adjacent
carriers of the same frequency band. However, using antenna downtilt as the
only solution to mitigate coexistence problems will not mitigate coexistence
issues.
# 7 Ecosystem aspects
## 7.1 Terminal eco-system considerations
From the global eco-system of LTE TDD terminal perspective, 3GPP should ensure
that all UEs that support the new TDD configurations (10.0.0 and 9.1.0), if
introduced, also support the existing TDD UL/DL configurations. UE support of
the new TDD configurations (10.0.0 and 9.1.0), if introduced, will be band
agnostic.
# 8 Summary
Time synchronization and the same UL/DL configuration usage in both inter- and
intra-operator cases is essential for LTE TDD operation in the same band. When
all operators in the same region and same band always use the same new TDD
UL/DL 10:0:0 configuration then interoperator time synchronization may not be
required which needs co-ordination between operators, e.g. through regulatory
bodies.
The study has shown that there are scenarios where the new TDD UL/DL
configurations 10:0:0/9:1:0 provide downlink performance gains for the
operator using these new configurations. The amount of gain depends on the
percentage of UEs in the network supporting DL inter-band CA and on the number
of cells.
It is observed there is a coexistence issue in both full-buffer and non-full-
buffer cases resulting in performance loss of deploying the new TDD UL/DL
configuration 10:0:0/9:1:0 in a channel that is adjacent to another channel
that uses different TDD UL/DL configuration. The degradation was larger for
the macro-macro than for the macro-pico scenario.
The study has identified some potential concepts for mitigating the above
performance degradation. Several different concepts and solutions were
discussed and captured, however, the detailed feasibility has not been
assessed for any of the solutions. Ensuring mandatory support and testability
of necessary interference mitigation solution(s) is a pre-requisite for
specifying the new TDD configurations 10:0:0/9:1:0 for LTE TDD.
The study also concluded that from the global eco-system of LTE TDD terminal
perspective, 3GPP should ensure that all UEs that support the new TDD
configurations (10.0.0 and 9.1.0), if introduced, also support the existing
TDD UL/DL configurations. UE support of the new TDD configurations (10.0.0 and
9.1.0), if introduced, will be band agnostic.
