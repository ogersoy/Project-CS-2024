# 4 Background
A band plan was agreed as the outcome of the SI on AWS-Extension band for LTE
and is documented in TR 36.849 [3].
\- 70+90 (1710 - 1780 MHz / 2110 - 2200 MHz, fixed duplex with downlink intra-
band CA across 90 MHz span)
Interoperability within the band was also discussed during the SI, following
the FCC expectations in [4], It was agreed and documented in [3] that _\"if
during the WI for the above band plan it is concluded that interoperability
across any part of the band cannot be achieved, then RAN4 agrees to address
those interoperability issues\"_. To this end, it is expected that support of
CA will be specified for the band.
Following are the objectives of the WI [5]:
1) Specify a new operating band with UL 1710 - 1780 MHz and DL 2110 - 2200 MHz
with:
\- Fixed duplex spacing of 400 MHz
\- Support for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz bandwidths
2) Support interoperability across the complete band (1710-1780/2110-2200 MHz)
by means of intra-band CA
\- Specification of intra-band CA shall be completed as part of the WI
3) Interoperability shall be met by intra band carrier aggregation, and if it
is determined that interoperability cannot be met by intra band CA, the means
by which interoperability will be achieved shall be specified and the WID
shall be modified.

# 7 General issues
## 7.1 Co-existence with other 3GPP bands
Co-existence with Bands 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29,
30, 38, 41 need to be considered. Bands 5, 12, 13, 14, 17, 26 and 29 are low
bands and far enough from the AWS-extension band or band 66. Band 2, 7, 24,
25, 30 and 38 are high bands with enough separation towards Band 66.
The Band 66 UL emissions can be kept as -50dBm/MHz for protection of Band 2,
7, 24, 25, 30 and 38. In addition, Band 66 also needs to protect its own DL
and thus will also protect the overlapping DL bands, i.e. DL of Band 4, Band
10 and Band 23. Changes to TS 36.101 are included in Table 7.1-1.

BS-BS co-existence and co-location with other 3GPP bands is covered in clauses
8.2 and 8.3.
## 7.2 Interoperability by means of CA
It is observed that all Band 66 UEs must be able to access the full 70+90MHz
frequency range. Interoperability will be met by mandating all inter-band
and/or intra-band CA-capable UEs supporting Band 66 to support 2DL/1UL intra-
band CA specified in the present document.

### 8.1.B Band 4 support
A UE that supports Band 66 should also support Band 4. The capabilities
support is part of TS 36.306 while TS 36.101 specifies the minimum RF
characteristics and performance requirements for UE. The following will be
added in TS 36.101:

### 8.1.1 UE TX requirements
\
#### 8.1.1.1 Unwanted emissions
\
#### 8.1.1.2 Maximum output power
Maximum output power is also potentially impacted by the additional front-end
loss associated with the Band 66 filter compared to the Band 4 filter. If, for
example, it is desired to share a common PA between Band 4 and Band 66, it can
be expected that the maximum output power in Band 66 would be degraded by the
0.6 dB additional Tx insertion loss in the Band 66 filter. However, it is
possible that a shared PA in this frequency range is also shared with other
bands which may require more output power. Band 4 is typically not the
limiting band when dimensioning the output PA power. Therefore, in spite of
the additional Tx insertion loss in the Band 66 filter, it is proposed that
maximum output power can be maintained at 23 dBm +/- 2 dB for Band 66.
### 8.1.2 UE RX requirements
#### 8.1.2.1 UE REFSENS
The reference sensitivity is impacted by the additional insertion loss in the
Rx path since this directly increases the overall noise figure of the
receiver. Moreover, the loss in Tx isolation results in an increase to IP2
generated noise also degrading receiver performanceOn the other hand,
measurements on Band 4 devices show margins compared to the 3GPP minimum
requirements which may allow to compensate for the slight IL increase and
decrease in TX ISO.

In addition, the legacy Band 4 UE REFSENS will not be modified.
Another question that arises is whether âˆ†R~IB~ relaxations applicable to Band
4 should also be made available for Band 66 to promote interoperability. For
example, for a UE that supports CA_2A-4A, it is allowed 0.3 dB âˆ†R~IB~ in Band
4 single carrier reference sensitivity and a question is whether that
relaxation should also be allowed in Band 66. The answer is no. Any relaxation
as a result of additional front-end losses to support carrier aggregation
should be treated separately if and when such a CA combination is defined with
Band 66. The front-end loss, for example, of a B2+B66 quadplexer has been
observed to be much larger than it is for a B2+B4 quadplexer justifying a
larger âˆ†R~IB~ for Band 66. However, such judgment should be made at the time
when such a band combination is proposed and evaluated.
##### 8.1.2.1.1 Uplink configuration
Given the large 400 MHz Tx-Rx separation for Band 66, the uplink configuration
for reference sensitivity can be fully allocated.
#### 8.1.2.2 UE selectivity and blocking requirements
The ACS requirements for non-CA operation apply for the paired part of the
band, 2110-2180 MHz while the requirements for the unpaired part are specified
under CA. The following change in 36.101 (underlined:
\>
> 7.5.1 Minimum requirements
>
> The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5.1-1 for
> all values of an adjacent channel interferer up to --25 dBm. However it is
> not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper range
> of test parameters are chosen in Table 7.5.1-2 and Table 7.5.1-3 where the
> throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
> measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with

> in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1). [For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as
> noted in Table 5.5-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned in
> the paired part.]{.underline}
The same applies for in-band, out of band blocking, narrow-band blocking and
spurious response. The following change in 36.101 (highlighted):
> 7.6.1.1 Minimum requirements
>
> The throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
> measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with

## 8.2 BS specific (stand alone band)
### 8.2.1 Operating band unwanted emissions
As stated in the FCC Order (FCC-14-31) [4], the BS general emission limits
mandated by the FCC for the AWS-3 spectrum are the same as those of the AWS-1
(E-UTRA Band 4) and AWS-4 (E-UTRA Band 23), i.e. attenuate out-of-block
emissions by a factor of (43 + 10*log(P) dB) below the transmitter power (P)
for a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or greater. Therefore, the general limits
for Category A and the additional limits for Eâ€‘UTRA bands >1GHz as specified
in Clause 6.6.3 of TS 36.104 and TS 36.141 for E-UTRA Bands 2 and 4 shall also
be applied for Band 66. Note that the general limits for Category B Option 2
are not applicable in North America, and thus need not be specified for Band
66. The following impact to BS specification (on the basis of 36.104) is
agreed due to introduction of Band 66:
\>
6.6.3.1 Minimum requirements for Wide Area BS (Category A)
For E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, [66]{.underline},
emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.3.1-4 to
6.6.3.1-6:
6.6.3.2 Minimum requirements for Wide Area BS (Category B)
For E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 22, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, [66]{.underline}, emissions shall not exceed
the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.3.2.1-4 to 6.6.3.2.1-6:
6.6.3.3 Additional requirements
In certain regions the following requirement may apply. For E-UTRA BS
operating in Bands 2, 4, 10, 23, 25, 30, 35, 36, 41, [66]{.underline},
emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Table 6.6.3.3-2.
\>
### 8.2.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements
The E-UTRA BS spurious emissions limits currently specified for co-existence
with systems operating in other frequency bands are more stringent than the
general emissions limits by the FCC. To ensure sufficient protection to the
co-existing systems, the same limits as the other E-UTRA bands BS shall be
specified for Band 66 in Clause 6.6.4.3 of TS 36.104 and Clause 6.6.4.5.4 of
TS 36.141. The same modifications are needed in Clause 6.6.1.3 of TS 37.104
and Clause 6.6.1.5.5 of TS 37.141. Co-existence between Band 4, Band 10, Band
23 and Band 66 needs some special considerations as Band 66 DL includes the
Band 4, Band 10 and Band 23 DL frequencies, as shown in Figure 8.2.2-1
Figure 8.2.2-1: 3GPP operating bands around Band 66
The DL spurious emissions for BS co-existence applies at 10MHz from the DL
operating band and thus Band 66 do not need to fulfil the standard -52 dBm/MHz
protection towards Band 4, Band 10 and Band 23 DL. The same should apply to
Band 4, Band 10 and Band 23 emissions towards Band 66 DL.

### 8.2.3 Co-location with other base stations
The E-UTRA BS spurious emissions limits currently specified for co-location
with another BS are more stringent than the general emissions limits by the
FCC. To ensure sufficient protection to the co-located BS, the same limits as
the other E-UTRA bands BS shall be specified for Band 66 in Clause 6.6.4.4 of
TS 36.104 and Clause 6.6.4.5.5 of TS 36.141. The same modifications are needed
in Clause 6.6.1.4 of TS 37.104 and Clause 6.6.1.5.6 of TS 37.141.

### 8.2.4 General blocking requirement
The general blocking requirements currently specified for E-UTRA BS apply the
in-band blocking signal within +/-20 MHz of the UL frequency range of a band,
except when the DL frequency range of the same band falls within such range.
Since the duplex distance of Band 66 is larger than 20 MHz and thus no
exception is needed, the same general blocking requirements as specified for
E-UTRA Bands 4 and 23 BS shall be specified for Band 66 in Clause 7.6.1 of TS
36.104 and, Clause 7.6.5.1 of TS 36.141, to ensure sufficient BS receiver
blocking ability. The same modifications are needed in Clause 7.5.1 of TS

### 8.2.5 Blocking requirement for co-location with other base stations
The blocking requirements currently specified for E-UTRA BS when co-located
with BS in other frequency bands do not apply when the interfering signal
falls within +/-10 MHz of the UL frequency range of a band, except for Band 13
in order to allow co-location with Band 14 BS. Since no DL frequency range of
BS in other frequency bands is within +/-10 MHz of the UL frequency range of
Band 66 and thus no exception is needed, the blocking requirements for co-
location with other BS shall be specified for Band 66 in Clause 7.6.2 of TS
36.104, Clause 7.6.5.2 of TS 36.141, using the same interfering signal as the
other E-UTRA bands BS. The same changes are needed in Clause 7.5.2of TS 37.104
and Clause 7.5.5.2 of TS 37.141:

### 8.3.2 UE RX requirements
#### 8.3.2.1 UE REFSENS
The UE REFSENS for intra-band contiguous CA refers to Table 7.3.1-1 of TS
36.101. Band 66 UE REFSENS will include a NOTE stating that \"this requirement
applies for any E-UTRA carrier within 2110-2180 MHz\" Thus, additional text is
required to indicate that the REFSENS values in this table also apply for SCC
within the unpaired DL part. The proposed text is highlighted in green below.
For the verification of REFSENS for intra-band contiguous CA with one active
UL, the standard test configuration in clause 7.3.1A of 36.101 can be used.
The uplink allocation should then be according to Table 8.3.2.1.1-1 below with
the PCC fully allocated and contained within 1710-1780 MHz.
Table 8.3.2.1-1: Intra-band contiguous CA uplink configuration for reference

The carrier assignments are shown in Figure 2.1-1 with the PCC in green and
the SCC in red for the case in which the SCC is assigned in the 2180-2200 MHz
part. The information in Table 2.1-2-1 is in fact already covered by the
italic text below (excerpt from clause 7.3.1A in 36.101). However, it needs to
be stated that PCC is limited to be within 1710-1780 MHz and thus a line for
CA_66C has to be included in Table 7.3.1A-1
> For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the throughput of each
> component carrier shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference

#### 8.3.2.2 UE selectivity and blocking requirements
The same modifications as for UE REFSENS for intra-band contiguous CA are
required. Below, the necessary changes in TS 36.101 are highlighted.. An entry
for CA_66C is also needed in the in-band and out of band blocking in Table
7.6.1.1A-2 and Table 7.6.2.1A-2, respectively.

for the applicable carrier aggregation configuration. For UE(s) supporting one
uplink carrier, the uplink configuration of the PCC shall be in accordance
with Table 7.3.1-2. The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement in presence of
an interfering signal specified in Tables 7.6.1.1A-1 and Tables 7.6.1.1A-2
being on either side of the aggregated signal. The throughput of each carrier

### 8.3.3 BS coexistence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 66 contiguous DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 8.3.3-1 below:
Table 8.3.3-1: Band 66 contiguous DL harmonics and IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f-low f-high DL frequency (MHz) 2110 2200
2^nd^ harmonics frequency limits (MHz) 4220 4400 3^rd^ harmonics frequency
limits (MHz) 6330 6600
2^nd^ order IMD products (f-low -- f-high) (f-high -- f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) -90 90
3^rd^ order IMD products (2*f-low --f-high) (2*f-high --f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) 2020 2290
3^rd^ order IMD products (with maximum channel bandwidth for 66C) (2*f-low
--f-high) (2*f-high --f-low) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2070 2240
3^rd^ order IMD products (with maximum channel bandwidth for 66B) (2*f-low
--f-high) (2*f-high --f-low) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2090 2220
* * *
It can be seen from Table 8.3.3-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics as well
as the 2^nd^ IMD products of BS transmitting contiguous carriers in Band 66
will not fall into the BS receive band of any operating band, while the 3^rd^
IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Band 34\. Note that the
calculation in Table 8.3.3-1 (except the last two rows) assumes the BS is
transmitting with the whole 90 MHz DL frequency of Band 66. If the BS is only
transmitting up to 40 MHz (20 + 20 MHz) or 20 MHz (5 + 15 MHz) contiguous
carriers in Band 66 as stated in the WIDS, the 3^rd^ IMD products will not
fall into the BS receive band of Band 34 as shown in the last two rows in
Table 8.3.3-1. Moreover, Band 34 is not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Band 66. Therefore, the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics and IMD
products caused by BS supporting CA_66C or CA_66B will not fall into the BS
receive band of any other frequency band operating in the same geographical
area.

### 8.4.2 UE RX requirements
\
#### 8.4.2.1 UE REFSENS
For the verification of REFSENS for intra-band non-contiguous CA with one
active UL, the standard test configuration in clause 7.3.1A of 36.101 must be
modified when the SCC is assigned in 2180-2200 MHz. The standard configuration
for one UL has the DL SCC closest to the duplex gap as shown in Figure
8.4.2.1-1. This work when both the PCC and SCC is in the paired part of the
band.

Figure 8.4.2.1-1: SCC and PCC allocation for Band 66 intra-band non contiguous
CA according to TS 36.101
When the SCC is assigned in 2180-2200 MHz a swapped arrangement must be used
as shown in Figure 8.4.2.1-2. Now, since the duplex spacing is 400 MHz one
could actually consider making this swapped arrangement standard for all PCC
and SCC assignments in Band 66 as suggested in Figure 8.4.2.1-3. The
configuration of the UL PCC makes little difference on the performance in view
of the large TX/RX separation.

Figure 8.4.2.1-3: proposal for SCC and PCC allocation for Band 66 intra-band
non contiguous CA when SCC is within 2110-2180 MHz
The swapped carrier arrangement is covered in Table 7.3.1A-3of TS 36.101 by
adding an additional note applicable to CA_66A-66A (NOTE 16 in Table
8.4.2.1-1).
The performance for the SCC is measured relative to the REFSENS for non-CA
operation, as in the italic text below:
> For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier
> and two downlink sub-blocks, the throughput of each downlink component
> carrier shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
> measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with
> one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described
> in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) and parameters specified in Table 7.3.1-1 and
> Table 7.3.1A-3 _with the power level in Table 7.3.1-1 increased by âˆ†R~IBNC~
> given in Table 7.3.1A-3 for the SCC(s)._ The requirements apply with all
> downlink carriers active. Unless given by Table 7.3.1-3, the reference
> sensitivity requirements shall be verified with the network signalling value
> NS_01 (Table 6.2.4-1) configured.
It should be remarked that âˆ†R~IBNC~ for a carrier bandwidth in 2180-2200 MHz
is measured relative to the REFSENS in 2110-2180 MHz for the corresponding
bandwidth (NOTE 17 in Table 8.4.2.1-1).

#### 8.4.2.2 UE blocking requirements
The in-band and out of band blocking requirements for intra-band NC CA refer
to Table 7.3.1A-3. REFSENS for the SCC within the paired or DL-only part of
Band 66 and the configuration of the PCC are defined in this table. No changes
of the description of the test configuration are required in these
requirements,
The following changes in chapter 7.3.1A in 36.101 (underlined) are required:
_UE in band blocking:_
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and
two downlink sub-blocks, each larger than or equal to 5 MHz, the in-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink configuration in accordance
with [Table 7.3.1A-3]{.underline}. For this uplink configuration, the UE shall
meet the requirements for each sub-block as specified in subclause 7.6.1.1 and
in this subclause for one component carrier and two component carriers per
sub-block, respectively. The requirements apply for in-gap and out-of-gap
interferers while all downlink carriers are active.
_UE out of band blocking:_
For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier and
two downlink sub-blocks, the out-of-band blocking requirements are defined
with the uplink configuration in accordance with table [7.3.1A-3]{.underline}.
For this uplink configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each
sub-block as specified in subclauses 7.6.2.1 and 7.6.2.1A for one component
carrier and two component carriers per sub-block, respectely. The requirements
apply with all downlink carriers active.
Similarly to UE blocking requirement for intra-band NC CA, no modifications
are needed for ACS and Narrow-band blocking
#### 8.4.2.3 Other UE RX requirements
As per UE blocking requirement for intra-band NC CA, no modifications of the
description of the test configurations are needed for
\- Maximum input level
\- Spurious response
\- Wideband intermodulation
### 8.4.3 BS coexistence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 66 non-contiguous DL carriers can be calculated as shown
in Table 8.4.3-1 below:
Table 8.4.3-1: Band 66 non-contiguous DL harmonics and IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f-low f-high DL frequency (MHz) 2110 2200
2^nd^ harmonics frequency limits (MHz) 4220 4400 3^rd^ harmonics frequency
limits (MHz) 6330 6600
2^nd^ order IMD products (f-low -- f-high) (f-high -- f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) -90 90
3^rd^ order IMD products (2*f-low --f-high) (2*f-high --f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) 2020 2290
* * *
It can be seen from Table 8.4.3-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics as well
as the 2^nd^ IMD products of BS transmitting non-contiguous carriers in Band
66 will not fall into the BS receive band of any operating band, while the
3^rd^ IMD products of BS supporting non-contiguous carrier aggregation of Band
66 may fall into the BS receive band of Band 34. However, Band 34 is not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Band 66. Therefore, the
2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics and IMD products caused by BS supporting CA_66A-66A
will not fall into the BS receive band of any other frequency band operating
in the same geographical area.
