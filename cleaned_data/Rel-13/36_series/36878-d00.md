# 1 Scope
In some countries, several vehicles move with the speed over than 300km/h,
e.g., Japan Tohoku Shinkansen (320km/h), German ICE (330km/h), AGV Italo
(400km/h), and Shanghai Maglev (430km/h). With the increase of high speed
moving environment, the demand of using mobiles in such an environment in
E-UTRA is growing larger. Therefore, it is important to guarantee the
performance under such environment in E-UTRA.
However, in the current 3GPP specifications, since the maximum speed
guaranteed in BS performance is up to 350km/h, it would be challenging to keep
up with the speed of vehicles moving around 400km/h. In addition, since the
speed guaranteed in BS demodulation, UE demodulation, and UE RRM
specifications are different, even though the speed up to 350km/h is
guaranteed in BS specification, the same speed cannot also be ensured in UE
demodulation and UE RRM specification as well. Given the fact above, it is
essential to comprehensively revisit and enhance the existing requirements to
ensure the system performance under high speed environment in E-UTRA.
In addition, due to different commercial network deployment scenarios of
operators and surrounding environments (downtown/suburban or mountain areas),
there may exist some issues/scenarios that the current specified requirements
may not be able to cover and to guarantee the solid performance. Therefore, it
would be worth investigating potential issues/scenarios and identifying some
new requirements to ensure them from various aspects where the current
requirements are missing now.
The present document is the Technical Report for the Study Item on performance
enhancements for high speed scenario in LTE.

# 4 Introduction
## 4.1 Study item objective
The study item aims at comprehensively enhancing the performance requirements
for UE RRM, and UE demodulation up to 350km/h and study enhancing of BS
demodulation and UE RRM and UE demodulation above 350km/h to ensure the
mobility and throughput performance under the exiting high speed scenario, and
at identifying the new high speed scenario and specifying the performance
requirements for BS demodulation, UE RRM, and UE demodulation under the
identified scenarios. Enhanced performance requirements for existing
scenarios, and performance requirements intended for the new high speed
scenarios should be assessed in relation to any limitation posed by the
existing physical layer and higher layer procedures.The objectives of this
study item are followings:
■ Comprehensively enhancing of the requirements for UE RRM, UE demodulation
and BS demodulation under existing high speed scenario.
● Associated requirements to be enhanced for deployment scenarios with UE
velocity at least up to 350km/h as 1^st^ priority :

selection/reselection, and measurement accuracy performance
○ UE demodulation: PDSCH, PDCCH/PCFICH, PHICH, PBCH, EPDCCH demodulation
performance
○ UE CSI reporting: CSI reporting performance
○ RAN4 shall first identify the requirements to be enhanced.
● Associated requirements to be studied for deployment scenarios with UE
velocity above 350km/h:

# 5 RRM and demodulation requirements enhancements under existing high speed
scenario
## 5.1 General
Identified scenarios and detailed scenarios descriptions are defined in clause
6.2.1. Scenario 2e, 2g and 4 are regarded as existing high speed scenarios.
The performances of the three scenarios are evaluated in this section.
The high speed condition of scenario 2e could reuse channel model for the
Scenario 3: Tunnel for multi-antennas specified in TS 36.104 B.3 [2]. The high
speed condition of scenario 2g could reuse the channel model of Scenario 2:
Tunnel with leaky cable specified in TS 25.104 B.4A [3]. The high speed
condition of scenario 4 could reuse the channel model of Scenario 1: Open
space specified in TS 36.104 B.3[2]. Since the parameters of scenario 2e, 2g
and 4 are different of the parameters defined in TS 36.104 [2]and TS 25.104
[3], so the parameters for the three scenarios are listed in Table 5.1-1. In
order not to introduce misunderstandings, the UTRA scenarios numbering will be
kept here.
■ Scenario 1 (corresponding to scenario 4 in this SI): Open space
■ Scenario 2(corresponding to scenario 2g in this SI): Tunnel with leaky cable
■ Scenario 3(corresponding to scenario 2e in this SI): Tunnel for multi-
antennas

## 5.2 RRM requirements enhancements under existing high speed scenario
From RRM requirements perspective, cell identification, RLM and measurement
accuracy performance shall be evaluated under the existing high speed channel
with corresponding parameters in Table 5.1-1.
For simulation evaluation, the Doppler shift variation of scenario 3 is more
frequent compared with scenario 1, so in simulation assumptions, scenario 3
for HST conditions is considered. In TS 36.104 [2], the leaky cable scenario
is removed. The reason for this removal was no interest in keeping such
scenario in the E-UTRA specification. So in this SI, the scenario 2 for HST
conditions is not considered either.

#### 5.2.2.3 Cell identification
##### 5.2.2.3.1 Simulation results
The results are presented in terms of the cell detection delay. The cell
detection delay is the time required by the UE to fully detect the cell (cell
3 in this case) by detecting its PSS/SSS sequences but excluding the L1 RSRP
measurement period. Table5.2.2.3.1-1 to Table5.2.2.3.1-3 shows the 90th
percentile of the cell detection delay statistics for AWGN with 0 offset and
AWGN with 1750Hz offset from interested companies.

## 5.3 UE Demodulation requirements enhancements under existing high speed
scenario
In this section the UE demodulation performance under the existing scenario
will be evaluated. The main effort will be focused on PDSCH channel. According
to the study in TEI, the less performance impact is found for the control
channel including PDCCH, PCFICH and PHICH due to the small duration of those
channels. And since the existing high speed train requirements under HST
channel model have verified the performance of UE frequency tracking and the
maximum, there is no need to introduce the new UE demodulation requirement

captured in 6.2.2 can be viewed as the existing scenarios from the UE
demodulation aspects, and no new UE demodulation performance requirement is

demodulation performance requirements.

### 5.4.2 Performance characterization
#### 5.4.2.1 Limiting factors for high speed performance
There are two major limiting factors for high speed performance for LTE
system. For high Doppler shift due to high speed and higher carrier frequency
(_f~c~ >_ 2.6GHz), inter-carrier interference (ICI) will become severe and the
ICI impact should be considered. The second limiting factor is the receiver's
capability to track Doppler shift with reasonable channel estimation
performance. These two major issues determine link performance under high
speed scenarios for both uplink and downlink.
##### 5.4.2.1.1 ICI
For OFDM system, when the channel is varied in one OFDM symbol, subcarriers
will no longer be orthogonal. This loss of subcarrier orthogonality causes
inter-carrier interference (ICI). Usually, the system design uses sufficient
subcarrier spacing to mitigate potential ICI. The LTE system design (15kHz
subcarrier spacing) ensures small inter-carrier interference at reasonable
Doppler shifts to meet the speed requirement between base station and UE. As
the channel's variation becomes significant, as in high speed scenarios, the
ICI will be increased as an alternative interference source to impact
receiver's link performance.
The ICI, caused by Doppler spread, can be modeled as a Gaussian random
variable when the number of subcarriers is sufficient large with central limit
theorem. The ICI power {width="0.125in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}, which
is caused by Doppler spread with a Doppler frequency
{width="0.13541666666666666in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}, can be
represented as
{width="2.832638888888889in" height="0.46875in"} (5.4.2.1.1-1)
where {width="0.14583333333333334in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} is the
transmit power, {width="0.11458333333333333in" height="0.17708333333333334in"}
is number of subcarriers per OFDM symbol, {width="0.125in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"}is symbol time duration, and
{width="0.2916666666666667in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} is the zero-
order Bessel function of the first kind. The ICI power
{width="0.13541666666666666in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} and the signal
Tx power {width="0.14583333333333334in" height="0.17708333333333334in"} are
the average power per subcarrier.
Based on the equation, the ratio of {width="0.3645833333333333in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"} of LTE, as the potential degradation by ICI,
can be illustrated in Figure 5.4.2.1.1-1, as a function of the Doppler
frequency. The ICI impact is shown from Doppler frequency up to 850Hz in
Figure 5.4.2.1.1-1.
{width="3.990972222222222in" height="3.0006944444444446in"}
Figure 5.4.2.1.1-1: ICI degradation of LTE at Doppler frequency
As expected, Figure 5.4.2.1.1-1 shows that ICI will become more severe when
Doppler shift becomes greater. For example, when {width="0.71875in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}, Figure 5.4.2.1.1-1 indicates that there is an
ICI interference floor at \~23dB. When {width="0.71875in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}, the ICI noise floor is at \~26dB. To better
illustrate the ICI impact to SINR level, we fix ICI at {width="0.71875in"
height="0.25in"} to show SINR degradation due to ICI in Figure 5.4.2.1.1-2.
{width="4.000694444444444in" height="3.0006944444444446in"}
Figure 5.4.2.1.1-2: SINR degradation due to ICI
From Figure 5.4.2.1.1-2, it shows that there will be little impact of the ICI
interference at low SINR region. However, the ICI will become more dominant
when the SNR become larger, until the noise and interference at subcarriers
are saturated by ICI. In the example shown in Figure 5.4.2.1.1-2, the
effective SINR shows about 1dB degradation at SINR=20dB, and the SINR
degradation increases at higher SINR region until ICI becomes dominant, where
the effective SINR reaches 26dB. This is the limiting factor for LTE
performance under high Doppler. In the example, the SINR=26dB becomes the
maximum SINR and it is limiting LTE performance, especially for high order
modulations where high SINR is usually needed.
##### 5.4.2.1.2 Doppler tracking and channel estimation performance
The second limiting factor for high speed performance is the receiver's
Doppler tracking capability and related channel estimation performance. Under
high speed scenarios, uplink and downlink receivers shall use reference
symbols (CRS and DM-RS) for Doppler tracking and channel estimation in usual
operations. We show the time/frequency locations of DL and UL LTE reference
symbols in Figure 5.4.2.1.2-1, which highlights the reference symbol RE
(resource elements) with 1 PRB in 2 subframes.
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | {width="3.533333333333333in" | | height="1.5333333333333334in"} | height="1.5347222222222223in"} | | | | | (a) DL CRS allocation | (b) UL DM-RS allocation | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
Figure 5.4.2.1.2-1: DL CRS and UL DM-RS allocation
The RS locations in DL and UL indicate different Doppler tracking and channel
estimation capability. Usually, uplink receiver could be able to provide
better channel estimation performance because the uplink has more reference
signal than the downlink has, when the channel is static (time-invarient).
However, when the channel is time-variant in high speed scenarios, the more
time-dense allocation of reference signal in downlink provides DL better
Doppler tracking capability than UL. It is expected that there will be
performance difference between downlink and uplink under high speed.
However, it would be relatively easy for uplink to use more than 2Rx for
better tracking and channel estimation performance.

scenario

distribution is 10dB, which means that the non-fading component power in the
first tap is 10dB stronger than the power of the fading component.
Table 6.2.3.2-1: Parameters for leaky cable scenarios
* * *
Tap index Excess tap delay (ns) Relative power (dB) Distribution of amplitude
per tap Doppler spectrum 1 0 0 Rician, K=10dB RICE, K=10dB, _f_ ~shift~=0, and
Maximum Doppler frequency is 30Hz
* * *
In the Table 6.2.3.2-1, The RICE Doppler spectrum is given by
$S\left( f \right) = \frac{\sigma^{2}}{\pi\sqrt{1 - \left(
\frac{f}{f_{\text{max}}} \right)^{2}}} + \rho^{2}\delta\left( f -
f_{\text{shift}} \right)$ (6.2.3.2-1)
where _ρ_ ^2^ and _σ_ ^2^ are power of the dominant LOS component and the
reflecting or scattering components, and _f_ ~max~ is the maximum Doppler
frequency and _f~shift~_ is the Doppler shift, and
$K = \frac{\rho^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}$ (6.2.3.2-2)
■ Correlation matrix
If the performance for 2×2 antenna configuration is evaluated, the MIMO
channel matrix for rank-2 performance evaluation is given below:
For LOS component, the following static MIMO channel is used:
$H = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & j \ 1 & \- j \ \end{pmatrix}$ (6.2.3.2-3)
For the fading component, the low correlation matrix is used.

##### 6.3.2.2.3.2 Summary {#summary-7 .H6}
Summary in this section is based on the link level simulation and conclusions
from interested companies.
■ For cell identification requirements under leaky cable channel, the existing
cell identification requirements defined in TS 36.133 could be reused.
### 6.3.3 Possible essential enhancement options
In SFN channel, the relative powers of two taps are comparable and the Doppler
shifts of two taps are with the different signs at the midway of the two RRHs.
It would be challenging for UE to estimate the Doppler shifts and perform the
channel estimation. The simulation results of RLM in clause 6.3.1.1.1 show
that the PDCCH performance has degradation under SFN channel compared with
AWGN and ETU70. Therefore some enhancements are needed. The possible enhanced
options are described in section 6.4.3 in demodulation part. Different
enhanced solution options would impact the SINR value of Q~in~ and Q~out~, so
the test cases of RLM can be considered.
### 6.3.4 Other issues and possible options
■ RRM in DRX for idle mode:
The existing latency requirements under DRX configuration for idle mode are
not suitable for high speed scenario;
● Candidate solution 1: tightening UE requirements **(Huawei [R4-154763])**
● Candidate solution 2: providing the indication to UE and when UE is
operating in the high speed UE should follows the tightened
requirements**(Ericsson [R4-154562])**.
Other solutions are not precluded.
■ RRM in DRX for connected mode:
The following latency requirements in long DRX (no less than 160ms) for
connected mode would result in performance degradation under high speed
scenario:
• Cell identification time
• Measurement period
Note: There is no consensus on short DRX configuration. Some companies provide
the analysis showing in short DRX the existing latency requirements would
result in performance degradation under high speed scenario [R4-155792].
The following candidate solutions are provided,
• Candidate solution 1: UEs would need to perform cell search and measurement
more frequently than once per DRX cycle;
• Candidate solution 2: Enhance cell identification and measurement
requirements in DRX for high speed scenarios (Huawei [R4-155792]);
• Candidate solution 3: Trigger the active measurements, e.g., the UE could
increase the measurement activity if the serving cell RSRP falls below a
certain threshold(Qualcomm [R4-156050]);
• Candidate solution 4: Network provides the assistant information to UE such
that UE have different behaviour compared to the legacy UE (Intel);
• Candidate solution 5: Enhanced RRM requirements are defined up to the upper
bound DRX cycle (Nokia [R4-155854]).
• Candidate solution 6: Enhance RRM requirements based on the estimated UE
relative distance changes by the use of previous UE measurements at previous
DRX ON durations (Alcatel-Lucent [R4-158183]).
• Candidate solution 7: Reduce RLM (out of sync monitoring) window and RLF
timers to enable quick RRC re-establishments in the target cell (Qualcomm
[R4-157272])
## 6.4 Downlink performance enhancements under identified high speed scenarios
In this section the UE demodulation performances will be evaluated under the
SFN scenario which corresponds to Scenario 1 and 2d, and under the scenario of
leaky cable in tunnel which corresponds to the 1^st^ hop of scenario 2c where
the repeater without the frequency correction functionality.
### 6.4.1 Simulation assumptions
In order to evaluation the UE demodulation performance under the new scenario,
the link level simulations under both SFN channel model and leaky cable
channel model (which is for the channel from leaky cable to repeater in
tunnel) will be conducted. The detailed assumptions for the simulation are
given in Table 6.4.1-1 and Table 6.4.1-2. The purpose is to investigate the
impact of new channel model on the performance of time and frequency tracking
and channel estimation. Because the PDSCH duration is relatively long and the
PDSCH performance is more subject to Doppler shift compared to the other
physical channels. So it is proposed to focus on the evaluation of the PDSCH
performance under the new channel models.

#### 6.4.2.3 Summary of evaluation
■ SFN scenario
Based on the observation in 6.4.2.1, the significant performance gap is
observed under 350km/h and 30km/h in the identified scenario. So the
performance enhancement needs to be considered.
■ Leaky cable scenario
To guarantee the UE demodulation performance under the leaky cable channel
specified in 6.2.3 would not be challenging. There is no need to introduce the
new demodulation performance requirement for the scenario of the leaky cable
in tunnel.
### 6.4.3 Possible essential enhancement options
According to the summary of evaluation in 6.4.2.3, the significant performance
degradation under the SFN scenarios is observed, and the performance
enhancement needs to be considered. In this section, the candidate solutions
will be captured.
The impact of the candidate solutions on the specifications will be discussed
in the following-up work item, including the demodulation performance
requirements, RRM requirements and CSI requirements.
#### 6.4.3.1 Advanced receiver in high speed scenario
In the SFN scenario with the omni-directional antenna (or alike) or separate
antennas covering one of two directions per site , the relative powers of two
taps of the received signal are comparable, and the Doppler frequencies for
them are very high and with the opposite signs, when UE is located around in
the middle of two RRHs. The significant downlink performance degradation is
observed for the legacy UE, which can only track the single Doppler shift and
may assume the U-shape spectrum for Doppler spread, because of the imperfect
frequency tracking and channel estimation.
To meet the challenge, the potential solution of the new UE performance
algorithm under the SFN scenario is proposed in this section. The new
algorithms for frequency tracking and the channel estimation could be
conducted by the advanced receiver. Such receiver could be called as HeUE
(high speed scenario enhanced UE), which is characterized by
• The advanced receiver assumes the existence of multiple Doppler shifts and
is able to estimate them by utilizing the enhanced estimation algorithms,
\- E.g., the non-linear LS, MUSIC, high-order Yule-Walker etc;
• The advanced receiver is able to properly track the frequency to adjust its
own oscillator to keep synchronization by assuming the existence of multiple
Doppler shifts,
\- E.g., using the strategy where UE tracks the stronger tap when the power of
one tap is much stronger than the other and tracks the centre between two
Doppler shifts when two taps are almost with the equal power;
• The advanced receiver can conduct the proper interpolation for the channel
estimation especially in time domain,
\- E.g., conducting time-domain interpolation by using the Wiener filter
assuming two Doppler shifts instead of U-shape Doppler spectrum with the
single Doppler shift under the SFN scenario.
In Figure 6.4.3.1-1, the simulation result provided by Huawei [R4-157700] for
the advanced receiver with the fixed MCS is provided. The simulation
assumptions are provided in 6.4.1. Comparing the curve of 350km/h with the
advanced receiver (marked by HeUE in the figure) to the curve of 350km/h with
the legacy UE, the performance under SFN scenario becomes significantly
improved.
In Figure 6.4.3.1-1, the legacy UE is the UE complying with Rel-12
demodulation performance requirements. The modified legacy UE is the UE with
the modified frequency tracking algorithm to reduce the up and down of the
estimated frequency when UE is located in between two RRH-s.

Figure 6.4.3.1-1: Simulation results for the advanced receiver
**For the advanced receiver, the new demodulation performance requirements
would be needed and also the CSI reporting requirements could be considered.**
#### 6.4.3.2 BS frequency pre-compensation
In this section, the BS based solution called the BS frequency pre-
compensation is introduced, in which BS will determine the downlink Doppler
frequency to be compensated by estimating the uplink Doppler frequency using
the uplink signal, e.g., PUCCH and PUSCH, and then compensate the frequency
per RRH before transmitting in downlink.
In Figure 6.4.3.2-1, the simulation result with the frequency pre-compensation
under the SFN channel model defined in 6.4.2.1 with 350km/h velocity is
provided compared with the performance of legacy UE assuming the fixed MCS
assumption. During the simulation, the BS is assumed to use the UE 100 meters
away from the targeting UE as the reference point to estimate the Doppler
frequency for the compensation per RRH. It is assumed that the Doppler shift
estimation at each RRH is ideal. UE is the legacy UE which assumes the single
Doppler shift and U-shape spectrum for Doppler spread. And the other
simulation assumptions are provided in 6.4.1 and more details are referred in
R4-155658.
From Figure 6.4.3.2-1, the performance of PDSCH under SFN scenario can be
significantly improved by using the BS frequency pre-compensation scheme.
{width="5.073611111111111in" height="3.595833333333333in"}
Figure 6.4.3.2-1: Simulation results for the solution of BS frequency pre-
compensation (R4-155658)
**More analysis on the BS frequency pre-compensation will be provided in the
following. The BS frequency pre-compensation discussed here is mainly based on
the CRS transmission mode (in order to enhance both system information block
transmission and data transmission), and the frequency to be compensated is
cell-specific. As a result, for the scenario where the train pass one site,
the UEs in the front of the train and in the rear of the train may observe the
different Doppler frequencies. The UE performance won't degrade significantly
in such scenario, but some possible remedies may be needed. Firstly, for the
site with the omni-directional antenna or the antenna alike, one path of
signal from the nearest site will dominate the channel and the performance can
be guaranteed if UE can track the dominant Doppler frequency. Secondly, the
splitting RRH-s will be used per site, and each RRH will cover one of two
directions, and the different Doppler frequency compensations are able to
apply to the separate RRH-s.**
**There are other aspects which may need further analysis like the speed of
the frequency compensation loop when a UE is passing a RRH site at high speed
and the case when two trains meet each other.**
#### 6.4.3.3 Unidirectional SFN scenario
The Unidirectional SFN scenario is based on a network deployment where
directional antennas are used and where it therefore can be controlled at
which point a UE leaves one beam and enters the next. The intention is to
provide a stable downlink carrier frequency as experienced by the UE when
travelling at high speed. This can be achieved by arranging the RRHs in such
manner that the strongest signal received by the UE has a nearly constant
Doppler shift without sign-alternation. A stable downlink frequency as
experienced by the UE leads to that uplink transmissions from the same UE are
received by the RRHs with a nearly constant frequency offset. Additionally,
all UEs travelling onboard the same train share the same Doppler and frequency
offset characteristics.
The Unidirectional SFN scenario is intended to serve both existing HST
requirements (support of UE speeds up to 350km/h) and future potential
requirements (support of UE speeds higher than 350km/h; evaluation carried out
at 500 and 750km/h).
Downlink channel model, simulation assumptions and simulation results are
provided in the subsections below. Uplink characteristics are described in
Section 6.5.3.2. Information on possible solution for mobility between SFN
cell groups is provided in Appendix.
##### 6.4.3.3.1 Unidirectional SFN scenario (RRHs sharing the same cell id,
beams aligned in same direction)
In this section the channel model for the Unidirectional RRH arrangement for
SFN is described in terms of time-variable Doppler shifts, tap delays and
relative received power levels. The channel model is based on a 3-tap
propagation model, see Figure 6.4.3.3.1-1. For this model, DLTX and ULRX
beams, respectively, are aligned in the same direction along the high-speed
train track, and for the baseline configuration the DLTX and ULRX beams are
oriented in the same direction along the track.
Figure 6.4.3.3.1-1: Unidirectional SFN scenario in baseline configuration,
using a 3-tap channel.
For good performance it is essential that side-lobes directed towards the
track are received at lower power than the signal from the main-lobe. Hence
the antenna characteristics and particularly the antenna radiation pattern is
of importance, and is a limiting factor for which geometries with respect to
inter-site distance D~S~ and minimum track-to-RRH distance D~min~ , that can
be supported. For the evaluation of the Unidirectional SFN scenario an
exemplary antenna with FBR and FSR of somewhat more than 30dB has been
selected, although antennas with lower FBR and/or FSR can be used provided
that D~S~ and D~min~ are chosen accordingly. The antenna radiation pattern of
the exemplary antenna is shown in Figure 6.4.3.3.1-2 and described further
below.
Figure 6.4.3.3.1-2: Assumed antenna radiation pattern for RRH DL TX and UL RX
antennas in Unidirectional SFN scenario.
The principle of Unidirectional SFN is further illustrated in Figures
6.4.3.3.1-3 and 6.4.3.3.1-4. Figure 6.4.3.3.1-3 shows coverage of the antenna
models for RRHs positioned along a track. Figure 6.4.3.3.1-4 zooms in on the
area where coverage overlaps for adjacent RRHs, and it therefore is important
to avoid that the UE receives side-lobes from one RRH at higher power level
than it receives the main-lobe from another RRH.

■ Relative power
The signal power received by the UE from each respective path is given by
{width="3.613888888888889in" height="1.4270833333333333in"} (6.4.3.3.1-6)
where _G(_{width="0.53125in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}_)_ is a function
describing the RRH beam characteristics (amplitude and phase) for path _i_ at
angle {width="0.53125in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} relative to the main
lobe normal.
For the purpose of evaluation, the beam is modelled as a linear array with
beam shaping weights provided in Table 6.4.3.3.1-7, by which _G(•)_ is
modelled by a FIR filter. See Figure 6.4.3.3.1-2 for a sketch of

The time delay of each path is given by

■ Tap phase
The phase {width="0.3020833333333333in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} of
each path is randomized uniformly within [0,2π] at _t=0_. Then when passing a
RRH path 0 inherits the phase from path 1, path 1 inherits the phase from path
2, and a new phase is randomized for path 2. This scheme is used in order to
keep the same channel phase for each respective beam when the UE is passing an
RRH.
##### 6.4.3.3.2 Simulation assumptions for Unidirectional SFN
The link simulation assumptions for SFN with unidirectional RRH arrangement

##### 6.4.3.3.3 Performance characterization of the Unidirectional SFN
scenario

Simulation results for PDSCH demodulation performance in the Unidirectional
SFN scenario and under assumptions stated in Section 6.4.3.3.2 are provided in
Figure 6.4.3.3.2-1 through Figure 6.4.3.3.2-4. The simulation results for UE

moving.

##### 6.4.3.3.3.2 Summary of evaluation {#summary-of-evaluation-3 .H6}
■ Unidirectional SFN scenario
The PDSCH demodulation simulation results provided in Section 6.4.3.3.3.1 by
Ericsson [R4-157802] and MediaTek [R4-157385] suggest that the receiver
performance of a UE operating in a Unidirectional SFN network would be
insensitive to the speed at which it is moving.
#### 6.4.3.4 HST RRH with distributed orthogonal antenna ports (DOAP)
One solution to improve UE demodulation performance in the HST SFN deployments
is to use a combination of the SFN data signal (e.g. PDSCH) transmissions from
different RRHs and orthogonal non-SFN reference signal transmission from
different RRHs on orthogonal antenna ports (Distributed Orthogonal Antenna
Ports). In the below solutions, the UE needs be enhanced. In the latter case,
i.e., DMRS-TM deployment cases, a HST enhanced UE (HeUE) may estimate the
propagation channel and channel statistics including power delay profile,
frequency and time offsets for each RRH separately using the reference signal
and use this information to improve the demodulation of the combined SFN data
signal.
■ **RRH deployment with Distributed Orthogonal Antenna Ports (DOAP)**
In this section, a HST RRH deployment with distributed reference signal
transmission using orthogonal antenna ports is proposed to combat with the
problem of large opposite Doppler shifts at the UE side.
The outlines of proposed RRH deployments are as below:
(i) CRS-TM deployment :
● SFN RRHs use CRS-based PDSCH transmission modes.
● All RRHs in a SFN group transmit same PDSCH payload simultaneously (i.e.
joint transmission for data);
● In the RRH deployment along the train rail, a subset of RRHs (e.g. odd-
numbered RRHs) may use one antenna port (or a pair of APs, e.g. CRS AP 0
and/or CRS AP 2) and another subset of RRHs (e.g. even-numbered RRHs) use
another antenna port (e.g. CRS AP 1 and/or CRS AP 3);
● Different subsets of RRHs transmit reference signals of different AP(s) in
SFN. The corresponding CRSs are orthogonal. The CRS antenna ports in the
deployment builds DOAPs.
(ii) DMRS-TM deployment :
● SFN RRHs use DMRS-based PDSCH transmission modes (i.e. TM 8, 9 or 10).
● All RRHs in a SFN group transmit same PDSCH payload simultaneously (i.e.
joint transmission for data);
● In the RRH deployment along the train rail, a subset of RRHs (e.g. odd-
numbered RRHs) may use one antenna port (e.g. DMRS AP 7 or DMRS AP 9) and
another subset of RRHs (e.g. even-numbered RRHs) use another antenna port
(e.g. DMRS AP 8 or DMRS AP 10);
● The odd- and even-numbered RRHs transmit reference signals of different
AP(s) in SFN. The corresponding DMRSs are orthogonal. The DMRS APs in the
deployment builds DOAPs.
The RRM measurement, demodulation and CSI feedback performance can be further
investigated.
Figure 6.4.3.4-1 is an example of RRH deployment scenario with DMRS DOAPs.
CRS-TMs network can be deployed with the same concept.

Figure 6.4.3.4-1: Conceptual diagram of DMRS-TM transmission from RRHs along
rail to high speed train
■ **Signal processing at the UE**
Using the DOAP approach, the HST enhanced UE (HeUE) can take advantage of the
orthogonality property of APs to handle the opposite Doppler shifts effect
using time/frequency tracking and channel estimation. Channel propagation
parameters such as Doppler spread, Doppler shift, delay spread, delay shift,
average gain can be estimated per DOAP, which means estimations per a RRH-HeUE
channel link.
Figure 6.4.3.4-2: UE channel parameter estimations per DOAP [Intel R4-158182]
● From the receiver perspective, the UE is able to execute channel parameter
estimations per DOAP. PDSCH received signal appears like joint transmission
received signal in SFN. Compensation can be applied per DOAP in CRS-TMs, and
per a layer in DMRS-TMs.
● A HST receiver can select a MIMO stream (or a layer) for demodulation and
treat the other as the interference depending on signal quality.
Alternatively, the receiver can combine the multiple layers' signals for
performance improvement.
The impact of the enhanced UE on the specification will be investigated in the
WI.
## 6.5 Uplink performance enhancements under identified high speed scenarios
In this section the BS demodulation performances including PUSCH, PUCCH and
PRACH will be analyzed or evaluated under the SFN scenario which corresponds
to Scenario 1 and 2d, and under the scenario of leaky cable in tunnel which
corresponds to the 1^st^ hop of scenario 2c where the repeater without the
frequency correction functionality. For the Scenario 2c, we simplify the
channel model by assuming the AWGN channel for the second hop.
### 6.5.1 Simulation assumptions
In order to evaluation the BS demodulation performance under the new scenario,
the link level simulation under the identified new scenario(s) will be
conducted. The detailed assumptions for the simulation are given in Table
6.5.1-1 for PUSCH and in Table 6.5.1-2 for PUCCH. The purpose is to
investigate the impact of new channel model on the BS demodulation
performance.

### 6.5.2 Performance characterization
#### 6.5.2.1 SFN scenario (RRH sharing the same cell id)
##### 6.5.2.1.1 PUSCH/PUCCH analysis
The key to guarantee the BS demodulation performance in the high speed
scenario is to correctly conduct the Doppler frequency tracking. To improve
the BS demodulation performance for SFN scenario, it is desirable for BS to
separately estimate the Doppler shift and compensate it for the received
signal on each RRH separately.
The existing high speed train (HST) demodulation requirements in 8.2.3 of
TS36.104, which verify the estimation and compensation of the Doppler shift in
the dynamic channel model, could be applied to BS supporting SFN scenario.
##### 6.5.2.1.2 PRACH analysis
The issue for PRACH under the high speed scenario is identified. The current
cyclic shift restriction set defined in TS36.211 for high speed cells is
limited to frequency offset within PRACH, i.e., +/-1.25KHz, the Doppler shift
out of the range of [-1.25KHz, +1.25KHz] would cause the detection ambiguity.
And this issue also exists in the existing high speed scenario. To avoid the
detection ambiguity, the PRACH enhancement under the high speed scenario is
needed.
In the following, the analyses from companies are captured.
In R4-155668, the issue of detection ambiguity is analyzed. Assuming $u =
5(\text{index} = \text{265}),d_{u} = \text{168},N_{\text{cs}} = \text{100}$,
the cross-correlation function for the PRACH is provided as in Figure
6.5.2.1.2-1. From the simulation result, it is observe that there are five
correlation peaks when the Doppler shift is $- 1\text{.}6\text{Δf}$and
$1\text{.}6\text{Δf}$, i.e., beyond the range of [-1.25KHz, +1.25KHz], where
$\text{Δf} = 1\text{.}\text{25}\text{KHz}$.

shift is beyond the range of [-1.25KHz, +1.25KHz]
##### 6.5.2.1.2.1 PRACH Detection for Very High Speed Cells {#prach-detection-
for-very-high-speed-cells .H6}
Let us denote $x_{u,v}\left( n \right)$ as a shifted Zadoff-Chu sequence with
the cyclic shift $C_{v}$from the $u^{\text{th}}$ root Zadoff-Chu sequence and
$x_{u,v}\left( n,f_{d} \right)$ as a shifted Zadoff-Chu sequence with Doppler
frequency shift of $f_{d}$. As well known, when the Doppler shift $f_{d}$ is
within [-1.25KHz, +1.25KHz], the PRACH detection needs to be implement by
using three detection windows [5, 6, 7], which correspond to the Zadoff-Chu
sequences with the cyclic shifts $\pm p \ast d_{u}\text{mod}N_{\text{ZC}}(p =
0,1)$, where $d_{u}$ is the cyclic shifts corresponding to the frequency shift
of 1.25KHz for $u^{\text{th}}$ root Zadoff-Chu sequence.
When Doppler shifts exceed +/-1.25KHz, the absolute correlations between the
received Zadoff-Chu sequence with frequency offsets in the range of
[-2*1.25KHz, +2*1.25KHz] with the shifted Zadoff-Chu sequence corresponding to
cyclic shifts of $\pm p \ast d_{u}\text{mod}N_{\text{ZC}},\left{ p = 0,1,2
\right}$ is shown in Figure 6.5.2.1.2.1-1.
{width="6.501388888888889in" height="3.8916666666666666in"}
Figure 6.5.2.1.2.1-1. Correlation of Zadoff-Zhu sequence with frequency offset
As observed from Figure 6.5.2.1.2.1-1 that when the frequency offset exceeds
the range of [-1.25KHz, +1. 25KHz], the PRACH maximum correlation will take
place with the cyclic shifted ZC sequence with shifts of$\pm
2d_{u}\text{mod}N_{\text{ZC}}$, which is outside of the three detection
windows for frequency offset in the range of [-1.25KHz, +1. 25KHz]. Therefore,
in order to support PRACH detection when frequency offset exceeds the range of
[-1.25KHz, +1. 25KHz], additional detection widows need to be used.
{width="6.148611111111111in" height="2.036111111111111in"}
Figure 6.5.2.1.2.1-2. PRACH Detection with five detection windows for
Frequency Offsets within [-2.5KHz, +2.5KHz]
In Figure 6.5.2.1.2.1-2, $W_{\pm p}(p = 0,1,2)$denote the cyclic shift
detection windows corresponding to the frequency offset of $\pm p \ast
d_{u}\text{mod}N_{\text{ZC}},\left{ p = 0,1,2 \right}$. As long as the Doppler
frequency offset is within [-2.5KHz, +2.5KHz], the maximum correlation between
the received PRACH preamble and the reference PRACH preambles will take place
in one of the detection windows, and thus the receiver should be able to catch
the transmitted PRACH preamble.
In order to avoid detection ambiguity, the PRACH Detection with five detection
windows should be used together with the new proposed restricted set of the
cyclic shifts. Once the new proposed restricted set of the cyclic shifts is
used, there will be no detection ambiguity, since regardless the maximum
correlation value is detected by which detection window, the receiver knows
the transmitted Zadoff-Chu sequence is$x_{u,v}\left( n \right)$, since UE will
not transmit Zadoff-Chu sequence with the cyclic shifts $\pm p \ast
d_{u}\text{mod}N_{\text{ZC}},\left{ p = 1,2 \right}$, which were excluded from
the new restricted set of the cyclic shifts.
To have better performance in PRACH detection, at the receiver side, the
received power delay profiles (PDPs) from these five detection windows can be
combined to make the final PRACH detection decision.
##### 6.5.2.1.2.2 Summary {#summary-8 .H6}
When the Doppler frequency shift exceeds the range of exceeds the range of
[-1.25KHz, +1.25KHz], a five detection windows, which corresponding to cyclic
shifts of $\pm p \ast d_{u}\text{mod}N_{\text{ZC}}(p = 0,1,2)$ may be used
together with the new proposed restricted set of the cyclic shifts for PRACH
detection. The use of five detection windows allows the receiver to detect
PRACH preambles when Doppler frequency up to [-2.5KHz, +2.5KHz]. The use of
the new proposed restricted set of the cyclic shifts will avoid the detection
ambiguity after PRACH preambles are detected.

#### 6.5.2.3 Summary of evaluation and analysis
■ SFN scenario
The BS performance under SFN scenarios can be verified by the existing high
speed train (HST) demodulation requirements in 8.2.3 of TS36.104. So there is
no need to specify the new BS demodulation performance requirements for the
SFN scenario.
For PRACH, the Doppler shift out of the range of [-1.25KHz, +1.25KHz] would
cause the detection ambiguity. To avoid the detection ambiguity, the PRACH
enhancement under the high speed scenario is needed.
■ Leaky cable scenario
Due to the small Doppler shift, the leaky cable scenario would not be
challenging for BS demodulation. It is proposed not to consider specifying the
new BS demodulation performance requirements under the scenario of leaky cable
in tunnel.
### 6.5.3 Possible essential enhancement options
#### 6.5.3.1 A new restricted set of cyclic shifts for extra high speed cells
It is well known that the cyclic shift distortion caused by the frequency
offset may create false alarm correlation peaks during PRACH detection. The
solution adopted in LTE to address this issue is to define a restricted set of
the cyclic shifts for each root Zadoff-Chu sequence [5]. The usage of the
exiting restricted sets makes it possible to retain an acceptable false alarm
rate, while maintaining a high detection performance even for high-speed UEs
with Doppler shifts within [-1.25KHz, +1.25KHz]. However, the exiting
restricted sets are no longer suitable when Doppler shifts exceed the range of
[-1.25KHz, +1.25KHz], as identified in [R4-154363] [R4-152604] and
[R4-152961].
In the following, a new cyclic shift restriction set is presented for uplink
Doppler frequency offset up to twice of the PRACH Subcarrier Spacing, i.e.,
[-2.5KHz, +2.5KHz].

#### 6.5.3.2 Unidirectional RRH arrangement
##### 6.5.3.2.1 Uplink characteristics in Unidirectional RRH arrangement
There are two possibilities when it comes to RRH arrangement for UL RX:
● UL RX and DL TX oriented in the same direction, and
● UL RX and DL TX are oriented in opposite directions
##### 6.5.3.2.1.1 Unidirectional RRH arrangement {#unidirectional-rrh-
arrangement-1 .H6}
With UL RX and DL TX in the same direction the base station will experience
twice the Doppler on UL RX, but the Doppler will be constant i.e. no sign
alternations, with only a minor ripple of few hundreds of Hz when passing a
sidelobe of an RRH (see Figure 6.5.3.2.1.1-2 for details). This configuration
is intended to be backwards compatible.
Figure 6.5.3.2.1.1-1: Unidirectional RRH SFN arrangement.
Figure 6.5.3.2.1.1-2: Path loss and Doppler shifts associated with a moving UE
with UL RX and DL TX oriented in the same direction. From Dmin = 30m, Ds =
1000m, f = 2.7GHz and speed 250 km/h.
##### 6.5.3.2.1.1.1 PRACH {#prach .H6}
All UEs onboard the same train will almost display the same frequency offset
characteristics. This narrows down the frequency offsets to take into account
e.g. at PRACH detection from a continuous range between positive and negative
Doppler, to a few discrete frequency offsets. This is particularly desirable
since PRACH is using a subcarrier spacing of 1.25 kHz and hence is more
susceptible to frequency offsets than other channels that use 15 kHz
subcarrier spacing.
Detecting Doppler characteristics of a UE during the initial access, assigning
the UE to a group of UEs with the same Doppler characteristics (moving in
first direction, moving in second direction and nearly stationary), and
reconfiguring the UE to use a PRACH configuration that is unique to said group
of UEs will improve performance of overlapping physical resources, i.e. PRACH
and PUCCH. Similar to the already existing SFN case, it may be a challenge to
detect the initial access UEs which needs more study.
The spectrum efficiency may be lowered when multiple PRACH and PUCCH resources
are reserved for multiple groups of UEs. Performance of Random Access from
Idle to Connected mode and impact on spectrum efficiency and regrouping of a
UE when Doppler frequency changes compared to the group, shall be investigated
in the Work Item phase.
##### 6.5.3.2.1.1.2 PUCCH {#pucch .H6}
By only allowing UEs with same frequency offset characteristics to share
resources, orthogonality and cross-correlation properties among the
information transmitted by the UEs can be maintained. This can be done through
configuring UEs within a group to have PUCCH allocations that are using the
same resources (resource blocks) and by detecting whether a UE deviates from
the group characteristics, and if so move the UE to another group and
reconfigure the UE accordingly with respect to PUCCH allocations. This could
reduce Doppler-induced interference and as a consequence would improve the
PUCCH decoding performance. So how to closely monitor the frequency
characteristics of the UE and the frequency monitoring accuracy need to be
investigated due to the UE may not always have uplink signals, especially when
the UE are sending SR signals after a silent interval during which the UE
doesn't have any uplink traffic or the UE wake up from a DRX sleep cycle.
##### 6.5.3.2.1.1.3 PUSCH {#pusch .H6}
The fact that the UE receives the signal from the same direction the whole
time, meaning that it almost experiences a constant Doppler shift with only a
minor ripple, will also improve PUSCH frequency offset estimation and lead to
better overall demodulation performance.
##### 6.5.3.2.1.2 Bi-static Unidirectional RRH arrangement {#bi-static-
unidirectional-rrh-arrangement .H6}
In this deployment configuration the UE receive DL transmissions from an
antenna in one direction and its UL transmission is received by an antenna in
another direction. With the modified arrangement in Figure 6.5.3.2.1.2-1, the
intention is that each site provides coverage in only one direction along the
track. If the same PCI is used for each eNB site then the UE will start to
receive a new path from the successive eNB site around the point where it
passes each eNB. Thus, in the ideal line of sight case the UE experiences only
a fixed Doppler shift.
Figure 6.5.3.2.1.2-1: Unidirectional Beam Arrangement.
However in this contribution we focus on the RRH uplink. Receiving the DL from
a single direction implies that the UE would experience a virtually constant
Doppler shift towards which it tunes its downlink carrier frequency and its
internal reference frequency. When transmitting on the uplink, the UE uses an
UL carrier frequency that displays the same Doppler shift. When the
transmitted signal is received by an antenna in the opposite direction, the
signal propagating from the UE towards the RX antenna will display essentially
the same Doppler shift, but with opposite sign and as a result the signal
received by the antenna will be at nominal UL carrier frequency and without
Doppler shifts most of the time. This is shown in Figure 6.5.3.2.1.2-2.
The UL Doppler shift is in Figure 6.5.3.2.1.2-2, RRH received frequency. The
UL Doppler shift is essentially zero along the whole track, except close to
the RRH sites, despite the high speed, 500 km/h and the relative high Wide
Area band used (2.7 GHz). This can be seen in Figure 6.5.3.2.1.2-2, RRH
received frequency. An antenna has a finite front-to-back ratio and this is
the cause of the deviation from zero Doppler. The front-to-back ratio assumed
in this simulation is 30 dB.
**Observation 1:** By unidirectional beam arrangement the UL Doppler shift is
essentially zero along the whole track, except close to the RRH sites, where
it is not zero but reduced to a fraction of the maximum Doppler shift.

Figure 6.5.3.2.1.2-2: Path loss and Doppler shifts associated with a moving UE
with UL RX and DL TX in opposite directions. From Dmin = 30m, Ds = 1000m, f =
2.7GHz and speed 500km/h.
The absence of significant frequency offsets regardless of whether the UE is
travelling at speed or is stationary would improve the PRACH detection
performance in the base station and may allow all PRACH sequences to be used,
Also PUCCH and PUSCH performance would improve.
An altered UE behavior is needed for determining the appropriate power level
to use for the initial PRACH transmission since the regular logic \-- the more
pathloss experienced on the downlink the higher output power to use -- is not
applicable. Instead a large distance from the DLTX implies that the UE is
close to the ULRX, and hence shall lower the output power.
**Observation 2:** An altered UE behavior is needed for determining the
appropriate power level to use for the initial PRACH transmission for bi-
static unidirectional configuration.
# 7 Conclusions
This technical report presents the results of a study on performance
enhancements for high speed scenarios.
In Section 5, the RRM and demodulation requirements enhancements under
existing high speed scenario haven been evaluated. For RRM requirements, the
evaluation results showed that
● Cell identification: the existing cell identification requirements defined
in TS 36.133 could be reused.
● RLM: the PDCCH performance difference between the existing high speed
scenarios and Rel-8 test channels shall be observed.
● RSRP/RSRQ accuracy: the existing high Doppler requirements defined in TS
36.133 could be reused for existing high speed scenarios.
For UE demodulation requirements, the simulation results showed that it is
feasible to specify the new PDSCH demodulation requirements under the ETU600
to verify UE performance.
For BS Demodulation requirements enhancements, it is agreed to specify the new
PUSCH requirements under ETU600.
In section 6, 10 practical high speed scenarios were identified which are
feedback by operators and interested companies. Afterwards based on the
scenario analysis from RRM and demodulation perspective, SFN and leaky cable
scenarios are prioritized to be studied. In section 6.2.3, the channel models
for both SFN and leaky cable model were specified. For RRM requirements, the
link level evaluations on cell identification (only for leaky cable channel),
RLM and measurement accuracy performance were carried out under the SFN
channel and leaky cable channel. The following conclusions were drawn:
○ PDCCH performance in SFN channel has degradation compared with ETU70 in
Rel-8.
○ For RSRP/RSRQ measurement accuracy requirements under SFN scenarios, the
current requirements in high Doppler conditions defined in TS 36.133 could be
reused.
○ No new RLM requirement, cell identification requirement and RSRP/RSRQ
accuracy under the leaky cable are needed.
Another issues for RRM requirements in DRX have been identified,
○ The existing latency requirements under DRX configuration for idle mode are
not suitable for high speed scenario;
○ Cell identification time and measurement period in long DRX (no less than
160ms) for connected mode would result in performance degradation under high
speed scenario.
Some candidate solutions are also provided by interest companies in section
6.3.4.
Downlink performance evaluations were carried out under the SFN channel and
leaky cable channel in section 6.4. The significant performance gap is
observed under 350km/h and 30km/h in SFN scenario. So the performance
enhancement needs to be considered. Some candidate solutions are proposed in
section 6.4.3.
The evaluation work was carried out under leaky cable channel as well. Based
on the simulation results, no new demodulation performance requirements for
the scenario of the leaky cable in tunnel are needed.
For CSI reporting, the new CSI requirements need to be considered for the
candidate solutions to enhance the downlink performance under the high speed
scenarios. The discussion shall be carried out in the following up WI phase.
For PRACH, the Doppler shift out of the range of [-1.25KHz, +1.25KHz] would
cause the detection ambiguity. Therefore to avoid the detection ambiguity, the
PRACH enhancement under the high speed scenario is needed.
Based on those conclusions, it is recommended the work item should move
forward.
###### ## Annex A (Informative): Mobility in Unidirectional SFN Deployment
# A.1 Mobility in Unidirectional SFN Deployment
This clause is informative and does not mandate any particular network
implementation. The information is provided purely to show one potential
solution that can support mobility of pre-Rel.13 UEs operating in a
Unidirectional SFN environment.
In a Unidirectional RRH arrangement a UE will quickly leave a strong (weak)
beam for a weak (strong) beam when the UE is moving towards (away from) the
main beam and passing the transmitting RRH. At borders between different
groups of SFN cells, i.e., where the PCI and potentially also other physical
parameters are changed, this would potentially become challenging for the
mobility function since the UE loses connection to the serving cell before
having had a chance to receive a RRC connection reconfiguration message with
mobility information from the source eNodeB (a.k.a. handover command).
One potential solution is to design a handover zone between the concerned cell
groups. In this handover zone the source cell is gradually phased out and the
target cell phased in, to allow the UE to report the target cell to the source
cell and receive a RRC connection reconfiguration message with mobility
information to the target cell before losing connection with the source cell.
Figure A.1-1: Handover zone created by overlapping coverage between SFN cell
group C1 and SFN cell group C2. Note that the RRHs can be co-located although
illustrated as separate sites.
One example of a handover zone is shown in Figure A.1-1, where the cell group
to the left (right) gradually is phased out and the cell group to the right
(left) is phased in for a UE moving from left (right) to right (left). The
handover zone may be achieved e.g. by using the relative transmit power levels
in Table A.1-1. By using such power levels one can secure that a UE can
maintain connectivity to the source cell until receiving the RRC connection
reconfiguration message.
Table A.1-1: Exemplary relative power levels for phasing out source cell and
phasing in target cell.
* * *
RRH C1 RRH #N-2 C1 RRH #N-1 C1 RRH#N  
Relative power level 0 dB -1.7609 dB -4.7712 dB  
SIR ∞ 3 dB -3 dB  
RRH C2 RRH #1 C2 RRH#2 C2 RRH#3 Relative power level -4.7712 dB -1.7609 dB 0
dB SIR -3 dB 3 dB ∞
* * *
The number of overlapped segments depends on inter-site distance, supported UE
speed and cell detection requirements for the DRX cycle in use, and hence need
to be considered when configuring the network.
The system throughput will be reduced in the handover zone as a consequence of
the lowered transmission power in the serving cell and the interference from
the target cell. While this cost in terms of system throughput might be
acceptable when the SFN cell groups (cells with the same PCI) are large
enough, it may have a significant impact on the overall system throughput when
the SFN cell groups are small since the UE will be in a handover zone a larger
fraction of the time.
There are several technical solutions for implementing the handover zone
(using separate RRHs, joint transmission through RRHs, etc). Depending on
solution there are different technical challenges that need to be addressed.
Some of the deployments may pose large challenges to the engineering
achievability. Since no analysis has been carried out regarding the impact on
the system throughput or the technical challenges on engineering achievability
it is suggested that they are investigated and evaluated further in the future
WI phase.
