# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Carrier: The modulated waveform conveying the E-UTRA or UTRA physical
channels**
**Channel bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF carrier
with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or downlink of a
cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for
transmitter and receiver RF requirements.
**Channel edge:** The lowest and highest frequency of the E-UTRA carrier,
separated by the channel bandwidth.
**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and the
donor base station.
**Downlink** : Signal path where base station transmits and mobile receives.
**Downlink operating band:** The part of the operating band designated for
downlink.
**Maximum output power, Pmax:** This is the mean power level per carrier
measured at the antenna connector of the Repeater in specified reference
condition.
**Operating band:** A frequency range in which E-UTRA operates (paired or
unpaired), that is defined with a specific set of technical requirements**.**
NOTE1: The operating band(s) for an E-UTRA Repeater is declared by the
manufacturer according to the designations in clause 5.5 table 5.5-1.
NOTE2: Unless specified, operating band refers to the uplink operating band
and downlink operating band.
**Output power, Pout:** This is the mean power of one carrier at maximum
repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load
impedance of the transmitter.
**Pass band:** The frequency range in which the repeater operates in with
operational configuration. This frequency range can correspond to one or
several consecutive nominal channels. If they are not consecutive each subset
of channels shall be considered as an individual pass band. A repeater can
have one or several pass bands
**Rated output power:** Rated output power of the repeater is the mean power
level per carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the
antenna connector.
**Repeater:** A device that receives, amplifies and transmits the radiated or
conducted RF carrier both in the downlink direction (from the base station to
the mobile area) and in the uplink direction (from the mobile to the base
station). ~~In operating bands with one exclusive link direction, only the
dedicated link direction is repeated.~~ In operating bands specified with only
down-link or up-link, only the up-link or down-link as specified for the
operating band is repeated.
**Transmission bandwidth:** Bandwidth of an instantaneous transmission from a
UE or BS, measured in Resource Block units.
**Transmission bandwidth configuration:** The highest transmission bandwidth
allowed for uplink or downlink in a given channel bandwidth, measured in
Resource Block units.
**Uplink:** Signal path where mobile transmits and base station receives.
**Uplink operating band:** The part of the operating band designated for
uplink.

# 4 General test conditions and declarations
Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter relative to a
value that is not fully specified in the E-UTRA specifications. For these
tests, the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal value
specified by the manufacturer.
Some requirements for the Repeater may be regional as listed in subclause 4.2.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported.
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.
The Minimum requirements are given in 36.106 [2] and test requirements are
given in this specification. Test Tolerances are defined in Annex B of this
specification. Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The
Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum requirements in 36.106 [2] to
create Test Requirements.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of test system
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the stimulus
signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance and
the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the
specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and
are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.

## 5.6 Channel bandwidth
Requirements in present document are specified for the channel bandwidths
listed in Table 5.6-1.

Figure 5.6-1 Definition of channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth
configuration\ for one E-UTRA carrier.
Figure 5.6-1 shows the relation between the Channel bandwidth (BW~Channel~)
and the Transmission bandwidth configuration (N~RB~). The channel edges are
defined as the lowest and highest frequencies of the carrier separated by the
channel bandwidth, i.e. at F~C~ +/- BW~Channel~ /2.
## 5.7 Channel arrangement
### 5.7.1 Channel spacing
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The nominal
channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.7.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the carrier
centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.
### 5.7.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN
The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 \-- 65535. The
relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink is
given by the following equation, where F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation where F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)

# 6 Output power
## 6.1 Definition and applicability
Output power, Pout, of the repeater is the mean power of one carrier at
maximum repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal
load impedance of the transmitter.
Maximum output power, Pmax, of the repeater is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in a specified reference condition.
In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply
also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal test
environment in Annex A2.
## 6.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 [2] subclause 6.1.
## 6.3 Test purpose
To verify that the Repeater maximum output power is within the limit specified
by the minimum requirement in 6.2.
## 6.4 Method of test
### 6.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex A2.
A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.
In addition, on one UARFCN only, the test shall be performed under extreme
power supply as defined in Annex A5
NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply also test extreme temperature.
1) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.
2) Connect the power measuring equipment to the Repeater output port.
### 6.4.2 Procedure

D.3 BW \ at centre frequencies such that the whole signal can be fitted inside the
> repeater pass band and at level(s) which produce the manufacturer specified
> maximum output power at maximum gain.
2) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain.
> 3) Measure the mean power at the RF output port over a certain slot.
>
> 4) Increase the power with 10 dB compare to the level obtained in step 2.
>
> 5) Measure the mean power at the RF output port over a certain slot.
## 6.5 Test requirements

#### 9.1.4.2 Procedures
1) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.
2) Set the signal generator to generate signal(s) in accordance to table
9.1.4.2-1
Table 9.1.4.2-1: Stimulus signal for operating band unwanted emissions testing

Repeater under test link and passband bandwidth Stimulus reference Note
Downlink pass band\ Repeater stimulus signal 4 The signal is defined in Annex
D.4 BW \ at centre frequencies such that the whole signal can be fitted inside the
> repeater pass band and at level(s) which produce the manufacturer specified
> maximum output power at maximum gain.
3) The detecting device shall be configured with a measurement bandwidth as
stated in the test requirement tables.
4) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value. To select the table and the maximum level, use the repeater
pass band and stimulus signal if necessary.
5) Increase the input power with 10 dB compared to the level obtained in step
2.
6) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value. To select the table and the maximum level, use the repeater
pass band and stimulus signal if necessary.
7) If the pass band is wider than 2,8 MHz, repeat step 1) to 6) with a new
stimulus signal of the same kind, but using different centre frequencies such
that the whole signal fitted in the repeater pass band.
8) Switch off the input signal to the repeater.
9) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value. To select the table and the maximum level, use the repeater
pass band.
NOTE: As a general rule the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller
than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than
the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables below,
where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the nominal pass band edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- Nominal passband edge is the lowest and highest frequency of the pass band
of the repeater.
\- BW~Meas~ is the measurement bandwidth.
\- BW~Pass\ band~ is the bandwidth of the repeaters pass band.
\- f_offset is the separation between the nominal pass band edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the repeater
operating band.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
The requirements of either subclause 9.1.5.1 or subclause 9.1.5.2 shall apply.

#### 9.2.5.3 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA Repeater operating band. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the E-UTRA Repeater, or they may be set by local or
regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA operating band.
It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement
is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since
this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional
requirements in the present document is given in Clause 4.2.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, UTRA, E-UTRA,
etc.) as listed below.
Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of
the repeater, at maximum gain.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
9.2.5.3-1 for an E-UTRA Repeater where requirements for co-existence with the
system listed in the first column apply.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
existence requirements in Table 9.2.5.3-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the repeaters operating band frequency
range of an operating band (see Table 5.5-1). This is also the case when the
repeaters operating band frequency range is adjacent to the band for the co-
existence requirement in the Table 9.2.5.3-1. Emission limits for this
excluded frequency range may also be covered by local or regional
requirements.
NOTE 2: The Table 9.2.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.5.3-1 for the up link
direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present state of
the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 73 dB between a
Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.
NOTE 4: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.5.3-1 shall be
reconsidered when the state of the art technology progresses.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS in
geographic areas in which both PHS and E-UTRA-FDD repeaters are deployed. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz
below the lowest frequency of the repeaters operating band and 10 MHz above
the highest frequency of the repeaters operating band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 9.2.5.3-2: Spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA-FDD repeater in
geographic coverage area of PHS
* * *
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 1884.5 -- 1915.7 MHz
-41 dBm 300 kHz Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in
1884.5 -- 1915.7 MHz
* * *
The following requirements shall be applied to E-UTRA-FDD repeaters operating
in Bands 13 and 14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is
provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also
applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz below the lowest
frequency of the repeaters operating band and 10 MHz above the highest
frequency of the repeaters operating band
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
9.2.5.3-3 for an E-UTRA Repeater where requirements for co-existence with the
system listed in the first column apply.

* * *
This requirement shall be applied to repeaters operating in Band 26 to ensure
that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz public safety
operations. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies
falling between 12.5 MHz below the first carrier frequency used and 12.5 MHz
above the last carrier frequency used.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 9.2.5.3-4: Spurious emissions limits for the up-link and down-link of
UTRA Repeater for protection of 800 MHz public safety operations
* * *
Operating Band Band Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 26 851 - 859 MHz
-13 dBm 100 kHz Applicable for offsets > 37.5kHz from the channel edge

#### 9.2.5.4 Co-location with base stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850 UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS are
co-located with an E-UTRA FDD Repeater.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
transmitter and receiver.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with Wide Area UTRA FDD or TDD base stations
Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of
the repeater, at maximum gain.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
9.2.5.4-1 for an E-UTRA FDD Repeater where requirements for co-location with a
Base Station listed in the first column apply.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in Table 9.2.5.4-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency
range immediately outside the repeaters operating band frequency range of an
operating band (see Table 5.5-1). This is also the case when the repeaters
operating band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency range of the co-
location requirement in the Table 9.2.5.4-1. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum coupling loss.
However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [5].
NOTE 2: The Table 9.2.5.4-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not
covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.5.4-1 for the up link
direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present state of
the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 73 dB between a
Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.
NOTE 4: The requirements of -83dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.5.4-1 for the up link
direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present state of
the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 43 dB between a
Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.
NOTE 5: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz and -83dBm/100kHz in Table
9.2.5.4-1shall be reconsidered when the state of the art technology
progresses.
# 10 Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
## 10.1 Downlink Error Vector Magnitude
### 10.1.1 Definition and applicability
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the ideal
symbols and the measured symbols after the equalization. This difference is
called the error vector. The equaliser parameters are estimated as defined in
TS36.104 [4] Annex E. The EVM result is defined as the square root of the
ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed in
percent.
### 10.1.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 [2] subclause 10.1.1.
### 10.1.3 Test purpose
To verify that the downlink EVM deterioration is within the limit specified by
the minimum requirements after the signal passed through the Repeater.
### 10.1.4 Method of test
#### 10.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex A2
A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.
1) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.
2) Connect the signal analyser to the Repeater output port.
#### 10.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the signal generator to transmit one signal according to E-TM3.1 in TS
36.141 [11] of the widest possible bandwidth to fit into the Repeater pass
band.
2) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain.
3) Measure the EVM and frequency error as defined in TS 36.141 [11] Annex F.
4) Repeat the procedure with all the narrower bandwidths of E-TM3.1
### 10.1.5 Test requirement
For the downlink of the Repeater the Error Vector Magnitude shall not exceed
9,25%.
## 10.2 Uplink Error Vector Magnitude
### 10.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected by
the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the IQ origin offset
shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the EVM.
The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and
absolute amplitude of the Tx chain. The EVM result is defined after the
front-e or 26nd IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector
power to the mean reference power expressed as a %. The basic EVM measurement
interval is one slot in the time domain.
### 10.2.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 [2] subclause 10.2.1.
### 10.2.3 Test purpose
To verify that the uplink EVM deterioration is within the limit specified by
the minimum requirements after the signal passed through the Repeater.
### 10.2.4 Method of test
#### 10.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex A2
A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.
1) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.
2) Connect the signal analyser to the Repeater output port.
#### 10.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the signal generator to transmit the widest bandwidth UL reference
signal according to Table A.2.2.1.2-1 in TS36.521-1 [12], that can be fitted
inside the repeater passband.
2) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain.
3) Measure the EVM and frequency error as defined in TS 36.521-1 [12] Annex E.
4) Repeat the procedure for all narrower BW UL reference signals according to
Table A.2.2.1.2-1 in TS36.521-1 [12].
### 10.2.5 Test requirement
For the uplink of the Repeater the Error Vector Magnitude shall not exceed
9,25%.
# 11 Input intermodulation
The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the Repeater to
inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the presence of
interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.
## 11.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the Repeater to maintain
the wanted frequency free of internally created interference.
The additional input intermodulation test requirements in Tables 11.5.2-1 may
be applied for the protection of an E-UTRA FDD Repeater input when GSM900,
DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS are co-located
with an E-UTRA FDD Repeater.
The additional input intermodulation test requirements in Tables 11.5.3-1 may
be applied when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS operating in another frequency band co-exist with an E-UTRA FDD
Repeater.
The measurements shall apply to both paths uplink and downlink of the
Repeater, at maximum gain.
## 11.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirements are in TS 36.106 [2] sub-clause 11.1.1, 11.2.1 and
11.3.1.
## 11.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meets the
intermodulation characteristics requirements as specified by the minimum
requirements.
## 11.4 Method of test
### 11.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex A2.
A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.
1) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.
2) Connect two signal generators with a combining circuit or one signal
generator with the ability to generate several CW carriers to the input.
3) Connect a spectrum analyser to the output of the Repeater. Set the
resolution bandwidth to 1 MHz in the centre of the pass band. Set averaging to
1 second or more.
### 11.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the frequency of the input signals, either below or above the pass
band, so that one carrier, f~1~, is 1 MHz outside the channel edge frequency
of the first or last channel in the pass band, and the lowest order
intermodulation product from the two carriers is positioned in the centre of
the pass band, according to subclause 11.2.
2) Take the measurement of the rise of the output signal.
3) Repeat the measurement for the opposite path of the Repeater.
## 11.5 Test requirements
### 11.5.1 General requirement
The intermodulation performance should be met when the following signals are
applied to the Repeater:
Table 11.5.1-1: Input intermodulation requirement
* * *
f~1~ offset Interfering Signal Levels Type of signals Measurement bandwidth
1,0 MHz -40 dBm 2 CW carriers 1 MHz
* * *
f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the first or last
channel in the pass band of the closer carrier.
For the parameters specified in table 11.5.1-1, the power in the pass band
shall not increase by more than 11,2 dB at the output of the Repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.
### 11.5.2 Co-location with BS in other systems
The intermodulation performance should be met when the following signals are
applied to the Repeater:

NOTE 1: The co-location requirements in Table 11.5.2-1 do not apply when the
repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency range of the
co-location requirement in the Table 11.5.2-1. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum coupling loss.
However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [5].
NOTE 2: The Table 11.5.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not
covered by the 3GPP specifications.
For the parameters specified in table 11.5.2-1, the power in the pass band
shall not increase with more than 11,2 dB at the output of the repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.
### 11.5.3 Co-existence with other systems
The intermodulation performance should be met when the following signals are
applied to the Repeater:

NOTE 1: The co-existence requirements in Table 11.5.3-1 do not apply when the
repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency range of the
co-existence requirement in the Table 11.5.3-1. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-existence.
NOTE 2: The Table 11.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
For the parameters specified in table 11.5.3-1, the power in the pass band
shall not increase with more than 11,2 dB at the output of the repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.
# 12 Output intermodulation
## 12.1 Definition and applicability
The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the ability of the
repeater to inhibit the generation of intermodulation products signals created
by the presence of an interfering signal reaching the repeater via the output
port.
The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation products
when a E-UTRA signal of channel bandwidth 5 MHz as an interference signal is
injected into the output port at a level of 30 dB lower than that of the
wanted signal. The wanted signal channel bandwidth BW~Channel~ shall be the
maximum bandwidth supported by the repeater. The Interfering signal centre
frequency offset from wanted signal carrier centre frequency shall be
according to the table 12.1-1..
The requirement shall apply to the downlink of the Repeater, at maximum gain.
Table 12.1-1 Interfering and wanted signals for the output intermodulation
requirement
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Wanted signal | E-UTRA signal of maximum channel | | | bandwidth BW~Channel~ | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal type | E-UTRA signal of channel | | | bandwidth 5 MHz | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal level | Mean power level 30 dB below the | | | mean power of the wanted signal | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal centre | -BW~Channel~ /2 - 12,5 MHz | | frequency offset from wanted | | | signal carrier centre frequency | -BW~Channel~ /2 - 7,5 MHz | | | | | | -BW~Channel~ /2 - 2,5 MHz | | | | | | BW~Channel~ /2 + 2,5 MHz | | | | | | BW~Channel~ /2 + 7,5 MHz | | | | | | BW~Channel~ /2 + 12,5 MHz | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE: Interfering signal | | | positions that are partially or | | | completely outside of the | | | downlink operating band of the | | | repeater are excluded from the | | | requirement. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
## 12.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 [2] subclause 12.1.
## 12.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to restrict the
generation of intermodulation products in the presence of a subject signal on
the repeater input and output ports, and an interfering signal applied at the
repeater output port.
## 12.4 Method of test
### 12.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex A2.
A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.
1) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater (wanted
signal). Connect a signal generator to the circulator on the output port
(interfering signal) and make sure the signal generator power is directed to
the repeater output port.
> 2) Detection mode: True RMS.
### 12.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.
2) Set the signal generator at the repeater input port (wanted signal) to
generate a signal in accordance to test model E-TM 1.1, TS 36.141 [11]
subclause 6.1.1.1, with a bandwidth as defined in table 12.1-1, at the level
which produce the manufacturer specified maximum output power at maximum gain.
3) Set the signal generator at the repeater output port (interference signal)
to generate a signal in accordance to test model E-TM 1.1, TS 36.141 [11]
subclause 6.1.1.1, with a bandwidth, level and frequency offset as defined in
table 12.1-1.
4) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth as described in the test requirements and note that the
measured value does not exceed the specified value. Measurements in the band
of the interfering signal shall be excluded. The measurements can be limited
to the power of all third and fifth order intermodulation products.
5) Repeat the test from step 3 on until all interfering signal centre
frequency offsets in table 12.1-1 has been tested, but exclude interfering
signal frequencies that are outside of the allocated frequency band for E-UTRA
downlink specified in subclause 5.3.
NOTE: As a general rule the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth can be smaller
than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than
the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.
## 12.5 Test Requirements
In all measurements, the requirements according to either subclause 9.1.5.1
Operating band unwanted emission (Category A) and the downlink requirements of
9.2.5.1 Spurious emission (Category A) or 9.1.5.2 Operating band unwanted
emissions (Category B) and the downlink requirements of 9.2.5.2 Spurious
emission (Category B) shall be fulfilled.
# 13 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
## 13.1 Definitions and applicability
Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the RRC weighted gain
per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted gain of the
repeater on an adjacent channel outside the repeater pass band. The carrier in
the pass band and in the adjacent channel shall be of the same type (reference
carrier).
The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater, at
maximum gain, where the donor link is maintained via antennas (over the air
Repeater).
### 13.1.1 Minimum requirements
There is no minimum requirement for E-UTRA signals
## 13.2 Co-existence with UTRA
This requirement shall be applied for the protection of UTRA signals in
geographic areas in which E-UTRA-FDD Repeater and UTRA BS are deployed so that
they serve adjacent channels. The reference carrier is a UTRA-FDD carrier.
### 13.2.1 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 [2] sub-clause 13.2.1.
### 13.2.2 Test purpose
To verify that the Repeater ACRR requirement is met as specified in sub-clause
13.2.1.
### 13.2.3 Method of test
#### 13.2.3.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex A2.
A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.
1) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.
2) Connect the power measuring equipment to the Repeater output port.
3) The measurement device characteristics shall be:
\- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in sub-clause 13.1;
\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.
#### 13.2.3.2 Procedure
1) Set the signal generator to transmit a signal modulated with a combination
of PCCPCH, SCCPCH and Dedicated Physical Channels specified as test model 1 in
TS 25.141 at the first or last 5 MHz channel within the pass band.
2) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain
3) Measure the RRC filtered mean power at the RF output port over a certain
slot.
4) Set the signal generator to transmit the same signal and the same input
power at one of the channel offsets outside the repeater pass band according
to Table 13.2-1.
5) Measure the RRC filtered mean power at the RF output port over a certain
slot.
6) Calculate the ratio of the measured power in the pass band to the measured
power at the channel offset.
7) Repeat step 4) to 6) until all channel offsets in Table 13.2-1 are
measured.
#### 13.2.3.3 Test Requirements
In normal conditions as specified in annex A.2, the ACRR shall be higher than
the value specified in the Table 13.2-1.
Table 13.2-1: Repeater ACRR
* * *
Repeater maximum output power Channel offset from the centre frequency of the
first or last 5 MHz channel within the pass band. ACRR limit P ≥ 31 dBm 5 MHz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test
requirements
The test requirements in this specification have been calculated by relaxing
the minimum requirements of the core specification using the Test Tolerances
defined here. When the test tolerance is zero, the test requirement will be
the same as the minimum requirement. When the test tolerance is non-zero, the
test requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the formula
used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.
The test tolerances are derived from test system uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the test
tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.
The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying test tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where
the test system uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2. In
this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test
tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as
defined in this annex.
[FFS: For example, a test system having 0.9 dB uncertainty for test 6 maximum
output power (which is 0.2 dB above the limit specified in clause 4.1.2) would
subtract 0.2 dB from the test tolerance of 0.7 dB defined in this annex. This
new test tolerance of 0.5 dB would then be applied to the minimum requirement
using the formula defined in Table B.2-1 to give a new range of ±2.5 dB of the
manufacturer's rated output power.
Using this same approach for the case where a test had a test tolerance of 0
dB, an excess error of 0.2 dB would result in a modified test tolerance of
-0.2 dB.]
