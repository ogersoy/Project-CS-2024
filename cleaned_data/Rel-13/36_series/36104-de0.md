# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 36.141 [4] Annex G defines
Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each
test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [3].
## 4.2 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations, Local Area Base Stations and Home Base Stations
unless otherwise stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 8.
Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 53 dB.
Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB**.
Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Femto
Cell** scenarios.
## 4.3 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements or set by local and regional regulation as
mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances that the requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.3-1 lists all requirements that may be applied differently in
different regions.

## 4.5 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For some
requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or exclusions to
the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band operation.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band
or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more antenna port(s) in
different ways are possible. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the following applies:
\- Single-band ACLR, operating band unwanted emissions, transmitter spurious
emissions, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to each antenna connector.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to the antenna connector configured for single-band operation and
no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-
band requirements are tested separately at the antenna connector configured
for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation supporting bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume synchronized operation,
**where no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur** between the supported
operating bands.
The RF requirements in the present specification are FFS for multi-band
operation supporting bands for both FDD and TDD.
# 5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
## 5.1 General
The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the operating
bands and channel bandwidths defined in the present release of specifications.
NOTE: Other operating bands and channel bandwidths may be considered in future
releases.

## 5.5 Operating bands
E-UTRA is designed to operate in the operating bands defined in Table 5.5-1.
Unless stated otherwise, requirements specified for the TDD duplex mode apply
for downlink and uplink operations in Frame Structure Type 2 [4].
NB-IoT is designed to operate in the E-UTRA operating bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12,
13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 28, 66 which are defined in Table 5.5-1.

## 5.7 Channel arrangement
### 5.7.1 Channel spacing
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The nominal
channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
For carriers in Band 46, the requirements apply for both 19.8 MHz and 20.1 MHz
nominal carrier spacing.
### 5.7.1A CA Channel spacing
For intra-band contiguously aggregated carriers the channel spacing between
adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of 300 kHz.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated E-UTRA carriers is
defined as follows:
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA component carriers according to Table 5.6-1 with values in
MHz. The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation can be
adjusted to any multiple of 300 kHz less than the nominal channel spacing to
optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation with two or more component
carriers in Band 46, the requirements apply for both 19.8 MHz and 20.1 MHz
nominal carrier spacing.
### 5.7.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the carrier
centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.
### 5.7.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN
The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 - 262143\. The
relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink is
given by the following equation, where F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation where F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)
The carrier frequency of NB-IoT in the downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 \-- 262143 and
the Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN in the range
{-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,-0.5,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The relation
between EARFCN, Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN and the carrier
frequency in MHz for the downlink is given by the following equation, where
F~DL~ is the downlink carrier frequency of NB-IoT, F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~
are given in table 5.7.3-1, N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN, M~DL~ is the Offset
of NB-IoT Channel Number to downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~) + 0.0025*(2M~DL~+1)
The carrier frequency of NB-IoT in the uplink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 \--262143 and
the Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN in the range
{-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The relation between
EARFCN, Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN and the carrier frequency in
MHz for the uplink is given by the following equation, where F~UL~ is the
uplink carrier frequency of NB-IoT, F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1, N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN, M~UL~ is the Offset of NB-IoT
Channel Number to uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~) + 0.0025*(2M~UL~)
NOTE 1: For NB-IoT, N~DL~ or N~UL~ is different than the value of EARFCN that
corresponds to E-UTRA downlink or uplink carrier frequency for in-band and
guard band operation.
NOTE 2: For stand-alone operation, only M~DL~ = -0.5 and M~UL~= 0 are
applicable. M~DL~ = -0.5 is not applicable for in-band and guard band
operation.
NOTE 3: For the carrier including NPSS/NSSS for in-band and guard band
operation, MDL is selected from {-2,-1,0,1}.

### 5.7.4 EARFCN sets for Type B multi-carrier downlink transmissions on
multiple Scells configured in Band 46
If the maximum frequency separation between the center frequencies of any two
of the carriers on which LAA transmissions are performed is > 62 MHz, then on
a configured set of carriers with carrier frequencies that are a subset of any
of the following sets of EARFCN, downlink transmissions in accordance with
Type B multi-carrier access procedure as defined in 15.1.5.2 of TS 36.213 [11]
are allowed:
\- for sets of two Scells: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {47090, 47290},
{47490, 47690}, {47890, 48090}, {48290, 48490}, {50290, 50490}, {50690,
50890}, {51090, 51290}, {51490, 51690}, {51890, 52090}, {52290, 52490};
{52740, 52940}; {53140, 53340}
\- for sets of four Scells: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {47090, 47290, 47490,
47690}, {47890, 48090, 48290, 48490}, {50290, 50490, 50690, 50890}, {51090,
51290, 51490, 51690}, {51890, 52090, 52290, 52490}, {52740, 52940, 53140,
53340}
\- for sets of eight Scells: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {47090, 47290,
47490, 47690, 47890, 48090, 48290, 48490}, {50290, 50490, 50690, 50890, 51090,
51290, 51490, 51690}
Additionally, if the maximum frequency separation between the center
frequencies of any two of the carriers on which LAA transmissions are
performed is ≤ 62 MHz, then the Type B multi-carrier access procedure as
defined in 15.1.5.2 of TS 36.213 [11] is allowed without any of the above
EARFCN restrictions.If the maximum frequency separation between the center
frequencies of any two of the carriers on which LAA transmissions are
performed is > 62 MHz and transmissions are permitted by national regulations,
then Type B multi-carrier access procedure is also allowed only within a
configured set of carriers that does not include any carrier frequencies that
are included in any of the sets of EARFCN above, as defined in Note 3 in Table
5.7.3-1. EARFCN values that are not included in any of the sets of EARFCN
above are as follows: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {46890, 48690, 50090,
53540}
For any LAA transmissions, single carrier access procedure as defined in
clause 15.1.1 and 15.1.2 of TS 36.213 [11] or Type A multi-carrier access
procedure as defined in clause 15.1.5.1 of TS 36.213 [11] are also allowed.
## 5.8 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where the BS operates can either be contiguous or non-
contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum operation
and non-contiguous spectrum operation.
For BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply also
inside the sub-block gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how the
limits apply relative to the sub-block edges.
# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of multi-carrier transmission
with one or multiple transmitter antenna connectors, transmit diversity or
MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter antenna
connector.
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for
the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus
such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B).
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 6 applies at all times,
i.e. during the Transmitter ON period, the Transmitter OFF period and the
Transmitter transient period.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements for NB-IoT in clause 6 applies for
all operation modes (In-band operation, Guard-band operation and Stand-alone
operation).

## 6.2 Base station output power
Output power, Pout, of the base station is the mean power of one carrier
delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the
transmitter.
Rated total output power of the base station is the mean power for BS
operating in single carrier, multi-carrier, or carrier aggregation
configurations that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the
antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.
Maximum output power (P~max,c~) of the base station is the mean power level
per carrier measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
in a specified reference condition.
Rated output power, P~rated,c~, of the base station is the mean power level
per carrier for BS operating in single carrier, multi-carrier, or carrier
aggregation configurations that the manufacturer has declared to be available
at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.
NOTE: Different P~rated,c~ may be declared for different configurations.
NOTE: For NB-IoT in-band and guard band operation, the LTE carrier and NB-IoT
carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied LTE channel bandwidth, the
output power over this carrier is shared between LTE and NB-IoT. This note is
applied for Pout, Rated total output power, Pmax,c and Prated,c.
The rated output power, P~rated,c~, of the BS shall be as specified in Table
6.2-1.

In addition for Band 46 operation, the BS may have to comply with the
applicable spurious emission limits established regionally, when deployed in
regions where those limits apply and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer. The regional requirements may be in the form of conducted power,
power spectral density, EIRP and other types of limits. In case of regulatory
limits based on EIRP, assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex H.

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with an E-UTRA BS.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.

and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 apply for the operating
band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in Table 6.6.4.4.1-1 to Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 do not apply
for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency
range of a downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1). The current state-of-
the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location
with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling
loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used.
These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [8].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.4.4.1-1 to Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 assume that two operating
bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in
Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical
area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in
the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that
are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations (except in Band 46), special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
The transmit intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements
caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna. The requirement applies during the transmitter ON
period and the transmitter transient period.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply regardless of
the interfering signals position relative to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
### 6.7.1 Minimum requirement
The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an E-UTRA signal of channel bandwidth 5 MHz as an interfering
signal is injected into the antenna connector.
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission
limits in subclauses 6.6.2, 6.6.3 and 6.6.4 in the presence of an E-UTRA
interfering signal according to Table 6.7.1-1, Table 6.7.1-2 and Table
6.7.1-3.
The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Radio
Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement is also
applicable inside a sub-block gap for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the sub-block gap. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges of each supported operating band. In case
the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in the gap
applies only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls
completely within the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For E-UTRA, the wanted signal and interfering signal centre frequency offset
shall be as in Table 6.7.1-1.
Table 6.7.1-1 Interfering and wanted signals for the Transmitter
intermodulation requirement for E-UTRA

For NB-IoT in-band and guard band operation, the wanted signal and interfering
signal centre frequency offset shall be as in Table 6.7.1‑2.

### 6.7.2 Additional requirement for Band 41
In certain regions the following requirement may apply. For E-UTRA BS
operating in Band 41, the transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed
the maximum levels specified in Table 6.6.2.1-2 with a square filter in the
first adjacent channel, Table 6.6.3.3-7 and Table 6.6.4.3.1-6 in the presence

# 7 Receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
The requirements in clause 7 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity, the requirements apply for
each receiver antenna connector.
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at the BS
antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating conditions. For FDD operation the
requirements in clause 7 shall be met with the transmitter(s) on. If any
external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B).
NOTE: In normal operating conditions the BS in FDD operation is configured to
transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter may be off for some of
the tests as specifed in 36.141 [4].
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the base
station receive period.
{width="6.165972222222222in" height="1.7486111111111111in"}
Figure 7.1: Receiver test ports
The throughput requirements defined for the receiver characteristics in this
clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
When the BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier. For ACS, blocking and
intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets of the interfering
signal apply relative to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge and positive
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge.
NOTE: Requirements may only be supported for certain frequency ranges within
the operating band(s). These frequency ranges could be different for NB.-IoT
comparing to E-UTRA.
NOTE: For E-UTRA BS with NB-IoT (in band and/or guard band) or standalone NB-
IoT BS, requirements are defined for 15 kHz sub-carrier spacing and 3.75 kHz
sub-carrier spacing. A NB-IoT Base Station supports 15 kHz sub-carrier
spacing, 3.75 kHz sub-carrier spacing, or both.
## 7.2 Reference sensitivity level
The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power
received at the antenna connector at which a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel.
### 7.2.1 Minimum requirement
For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in Annex A with parameters
specified in Table 7.2.1-1 for Wide Area BS, in Table 7.2.1-2 for Local Area

## 7.5 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) and narrow-band blocking
Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an adjacent channel signal with a specified centre frequency offset of the
interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system. For E-UTRA or E-UTRA
with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band operation) BS, the interfering signal
shall be an E-UTRA signal as specified in Annex C. For NB-IoT standalone BS,
the interfering signal shall be a NB-IoT signal as specified in Annex C.
### 7.5.1 Minimum requirement
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.
For E-UTRA Wide Area BS, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the
BS antenna input are specified in Tables 7.5.1-1 and 7.5.1-2 for narrowband
blocking and in Table 7.5.1-3 for ACS. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-1 for each channel bandwidth
and further specified in Annex A.
For E-UTRA Medium Range BS, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to
the BS antenna input are specified in Tables 7.5.1-1 and 7.5.1-2 for
narrowband blocking and in Table 7.5.1-6 for ACS. The reference measurement
channel for the wanted signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-4 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in Annex A.

BS antenna input are specified in Tables 7.5.1-1 and 7.5.1-2 for narrowband
blocking and in Table 7.5.1-4 for ACS. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-2 for each channel bandwidth
and further specified in Annex A.

antenna input are specified in Tables 7.5.1-1 and 7.5.1-2 for narrowband
blocking and in Table 7.5.1-5 for ACS. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-3 for each channel bandwidth
and further specified in Annex A.
For NB-IoT in-band operation Wide Area BS, the wanted signal and the
interfering signal coupled to the BS antenna input are specified in Tables
7.5.1-1a and 7.5.1-2 for narrowband blocking and in Table 7.5.1-3a for ACS.
The reference measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified
in Table 7.2.1-5 for each sub-carrier spacing and further specified in Annex
A.
For NB-IoT guard band operation Wide Area BS, the wanted signal and the
interfering signal coupled to the BS antenna input are specified in Tables
7.5.1-1b and 7.5.1-2 for narrowband blocking and in Table 7.5.1-3b for ACS.
The reference measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified
in Table 7.2.1-5 for each sub-carrier spacing and further specified in Annex
A.

The ACS and narrowband blocking requirement is applicable outside the Base
Station RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the Base station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.
For a E-UTRA BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating
band, the ACS requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap, in
case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering
signal in Table 7.5.1-3, 7.5.1-4 and 7.5.1-6. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.
For a E-UTRA BS capable of multi-band operation, the ACS requirement applies
in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF Bandwidth
gap size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in Tables
7.5.1-3, 7.5.1-4 and 7.5.1-6. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth
gap.
For a E-UTRA BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating
band, the narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any sub-
block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as the channel
bandwidth of the E-UTRA interfering signal in Table 7.5.1-2. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block
gap.

requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering
signal in Table 7.5.1-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

## 7.6 Blocking
### 7.6.1 General blocking requirement
The blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver ability to receive a
wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted
interferer, which are either a 1.4MHz, 3MHz or 5MHz E-UTRA signal for in-band
blocking or a CW signal for out-of-band blocking. The interfering signal shall
be an E-UTRA signal as specified in Annex C.
#### 7.6.1.1 Minimum requirement
For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled
to BS antenna input using the parameters in Tables 7.6.1.1-1, 7.6.1.1-1a,
7.6.1.1-1b, 7.6.1.1-1c and 7.6.1.1-2. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-1, 7.2.1-2, 7.2.1-3 and 7.2.1-4
for each channel bandwidth and further specified in Annex A.
The blocking requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth
or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band, the
blocking requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the
sub-block gap size is at least as wide as twice the interfering signal minimum
offset in Table 7.6.1.1-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency ranges applies for each supported operating band. The
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as twice the interfering
signal minimum offset in Table 7.6.1.1-2.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each operating band, with the exception
that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported operating bands
according to Tables 7.6.1.1-1, 7.6.1.1-1a and 7.6.1.1-1c shall be excluded
from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

NOTE: Table 7.6.1.1-5 assumes that two operating bands, where the downlink
operating band (see Table 5.5-1) of one band would be within the in-band
blocking region of the other band, are not deployed in the same geographical
area.

### 7.6.2 Co-location with other base stations
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of
E-UTRA and NB-IoT BS receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA or NB-IoT BS
operating in a different frequency band are co-located with an E-UTRA or NB-
IoT BS. The requirement is applicable to all channel bandwidths supported by
the E-UTRA BS and E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-band/guard band operation.
The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and E-UTRA or NB-IoT BS receiver and are based on co-
location with base stations of the same class.
#### 7.6.2.1 Minimum requirement
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS
antenna input using the parameters in Table 7.6.2.1-1 for Wide Area BS, in
Table 7.6.2.1-2 for Local Area BS and in Table 7.6.2.1-3 for Medium Range BS.
The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
Tables 7.2.1-1, 7.2.1-2 and 7.2.1-4 for each channel bandwidth for E-UTRA,
Table 7.2.1-5 for NB-IoT and further specified in Annex A.

### 7.6.3 Additional requirement (regional)
For the Public Safety LTE BS in Korea from 718 to 728 MHz in band 28, the
wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the BS antenna input are
specified in Tables G-2.2, G-2.3, G-2.4 and G-2.5 for the blocking
requirements. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is A.1-3
for 10 MHz channel bandwidth and further specified in Annex A.
## 7.7 Receiver spurious emissions
The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or amplified
in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna connector. The
requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX antenna ports. In this
case for FDD BS the test shall be performed when both TX and RX are on, with
the TX port terminated.
For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the
transmitter spurious emission as specified in clause 6.6.4 is valid.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band supported
on each antenna connector.
The requirements shall apply to BS that supports E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT
in-band/guard band operation or NB-IoT standalone operation.
### 7.7.1 Minimum requirement
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table
7.7.1-1:
Table 7.7.1-1: General spurious emission minimum requirement
Frequency range Maximum level Measurement Bandwidth Note
* * *
30MHz ‑ 1 GHz -57 dBm 100 kHz  
1 GHz -- 12.75 GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz  
12.75 GHz ‑ 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the UL operating
band in GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz Applies only for Bands 22, 42 and 43. NOTE: The
frequency range between 2.5 * BW~Channel~ below the first carrier frequency
and 2.5 * BW~Channel~ above the last carrier frequency transmitted by the BS,
where BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth according to Table 5.6‑1, may be
excluded from the requirement. However, frequencies that are more than 10 MHz
below the lowest frequency of any of the BS supported downlink operating band
or more than 10 MHz above the highest frequency of any of the BS supported
downlink operating band shall not be excluded from the requirement. For BS
capable of multiband operation, the exclusion applies for all supported
operating bands. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands
are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply
and the excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band
supported on each antenna connector.
In addition to the requirements in Table 7.7.1-1, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the levels specified for Protection of the E-UTRA
FDD BS receiver of own or different BS in subclause 6.6.4.2 and for Co-
existence with other systems in the same geographical area in subclause
6.6.4.3. In addition, the co-existence requirements for co-located base
stations specified in subclause 6.6.4.4 may also be applied.
## 7.8 Receiver intermodulation
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA signal as
specified in Annex C.
### 7.8.1 Minimum requirement
For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the BS antenna input, with
the conditions specified in Tables 7.8.1-1 and 7.8.1-2 for intermodulation
performance and in Tables 7.8.1-3, 7.8.1-4, 7.8.1-5 and 7.8.1-6 for narrowband
intermodulation performance. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-1, Table 7.2.1-2, Table 7.2.1-3 and Table
7.2.1-4 for each channel bandwidth and further specified in Annex A.
For NB-IoT in-band operation, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the
assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the BS
antenna input, with the conditions specified in Tables 7.8.1-1a and 7.8.1-2
for intermodulation performance and in Tables 7.8.1-3a for narrowband
intermodulation performance. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-5 and further specified in Annex A.
For NB-IoT guard band operation, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the
assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the BS
antenna input, with the conditions specified in Tables 7.8.1-1b and 7.8.1-2
for intermodulation performance and in Tables 7.8.1-3b for narrowband
intermodulation performance. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-5 and further specified in Annex A.
For NB-IoT standalone operation, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the
assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the BS
antenna input, with the conditions specified in Tables 7.8.1-1c and 7.8.1-2a
for intermodulation performance and in Tables 7.8.1-3c for narrowband
intermodulation performance. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-5 and further specified in Annex A.
The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the Base
Station RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth edges. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band, the
narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in addition inside any sub-
block gap in case the sub-block gap is at least as wide as the channel
bandwidth of the E-UTRA interfering signal in Table 7.8.1-3. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block
gap.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the intermodulation requirement
applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is
at least twice as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency
offset from the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the narrowband intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the
gap size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in Tables
7.8.1-3, 7.8.1-4 and 7.8.1-6. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth
gap.

# 8 Performance requirement
## 8.1 General
Performance requirements for the BS are specified for the fixed reference
channels defined in Annex A and the propagation conditions in Annex B. The
requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the base station.
Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single carrier
only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting carrier aggregation are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements. For FDD operation the
requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the transmitter(s) on.
NOTE: In normal operating conditions the BS in FDD operation is configured to
transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter may be off for some of
the tests as specifed in 36.141 [4].
The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined
as:
SNR = S / N
Where:
S is the total signal energy in the subframe on a single antenna port.
> N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
> bandwidth over the duration of a subframe.
For enhanced performance requirements type A, the SINR used in this clause is
specified based on a single carrier and defined as:
Where:
is the total signal energy in the subframe on a single antenna port.
> is the summation of the received energy of the strongest interferers
> explicitly defined in a test procedure plus the white noise energy _N_ , in
> a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission bandwidth over the duration of
> a subframe on a single antenna port. The respective energy of each
> interferer relative to is defined by its associated DIP value.
## 8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
### 8.2.1 Requirements in multipath fading propagation conditions
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. For 2Tx test the HARQ
retransmissions for two codewords are independent.

#### 8.2.1.1 Minimum requirements
The throughput shall be equal to or larger than the fraction of maximum
throughput stated in the tables 8.2.1.1-1 to 8.2.1.1-6 at the given SNR for
1Tx and in tables 8.2.1.1-7 to 8.2.1.1-12 for 2Tx two layer spatial
multiplexing transmission.

### 8.2.2 Requirements for UL timing adjustment
The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a minimum
required throughput for the moving UE at given SNR. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The performance requirements for UL
timing adjustment scenario 2 defined in Annex B.4 are optional.
In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one being
transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a stationary UE.
The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC parameters in Table A.7-1 and
Table A.8-1 are applied for both UEs. The received power for both UEs is the
same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are consecutive. In Scenario
2, Doppler shift is not taken into account.
This requirement shall not be applied to Local Area BS and Home BS.

### 8.2.3 Requirements for high speed train
The performance requirement of PUSCH for high speed train is determined by a
minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A.
The performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The performance
requirements for high speed train are optional.

### 8.2.4 Requirements for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH
Two performance requirements are defined for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH:
ACK false detection and ACK missed detection requirements.
The ACK false detection probability for PUSCH is the probability that ACK is
detected when data only is sent on symbols where HARQ-ACK information can be
allocated (i.e. by puncturing data).
The ACK missed detection probability for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH is the
conditional probability of not detecting an ACK when it was sent on PUSCH
resources.
In the tests for ACK missed detection on PUSCH, data is punctured by the
control information (i.e. ACK/NACK) in both slots within subframe on symbols
as specified in 36.212.
In both tests none of CQI, RI nor SRS is transmitted. Tests are to be
performed for one bit HARQ-ACK information (O = 1).
#### 8.2.4.1 Minimum requirement
The ACK false detection probability as well as the ACK missed detection
probability for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH shall not exceed 1% at PUSCH
power settings presented in table 8.2.4.1-1.

### 8.2.5 Requirements for PUSCH with TTI bundling and enhanced HARQ pattern
The performance requirement of PUSCH configured with TTI bundling and enhanced
HARQ pattern, as specified in 36.213 [11] clause 8 and 8.0, is determined by
residual block error probability (BLER) after HARQ retransmission. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at residual BLER of 2% for the
FRCs listed in Annex A.11. The residual BLER is defined as follows:
where:
\- A is the number of incorrectly decoded transport blocks after HARQ
retransmission.
\- B is the number of transmitted transport blocks (retransmitted transport
blocks are not counted repetitively).
The requirement is applicable for FDD. TTI bundling and enhanced HARQ pattern
are enabled in the tests.

### 8.2.6 Enhanced performance requirement type A in multipath fading
propagation conditions with synchronous interference
The enhanced performance requirement type A of PUSCH is determined by a
minimum required throughput for a given SINR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A.
The performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.
The purpose is to verify the demodulation performance when the wanted PUSCH
signal in the serving cell is interfered by PUSCH of one or two dominant
interferer(s) applying the interference model defined in clause B.6.2.
The requirements apply to the BS supporting the enhanced performance
requirements type A.
The requirements apply to the BS receiving the synchronous interference i.e.,

### 8.2.6A Enhanced performance requirement type A in multipath fading
propagation conditions with asynchronous interference
The enhanced performance requirement type A of PUSCH is determined by a
minimum required throughput for a given SINR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A.
The performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.
The purpose is to verify the demodulation performance when the wanted PUSCH
signal in the serving cell is interfered by PUSCH of two interferers from the
same interfering cell, applying the interference model defined in clause
B.6.3.
The requirements apply to the BS supporting the enhanced performance
requirements type A.
The requirements apply to the BS receiving the asynchronous interference i.e.,
the interference is time-asynchronous with the tested signal.

### 8.3.10 ACK missed detection requirements for PUCCH format 4
The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting an
ACK bit when an ACK bit was sent on the particular bit position, with each
missed ACK bit being accounted as one error.
The number of encoded ACK/NACK bits per sub-frame is defined for two cases as
presented below:
\- 24AN bits with 1PRB allocated
\- 64AN bits with 2PRB allocated
The requirements are applicable for FDD only, TDD only and TDD-FDD CA.
The requirements are applicable for both PUCCH on PCell and PUCCH on SCell.
ACK/NACK repetitions are disabled for PUCCH transmission. DAI based codebook
size determination is disabled. Random codeword selection is assumed.
#### 8.3.10.1 Minimum requirements
The ACK missed detection probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR given in
table 8.3.10.1-1 and table 8.3.10.1‑2 for 24 AN bits with 1 PRB allocated and

## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
### 8.4.1 PRACH False alarm probability
The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas, for
all frame structures and for any channel bandwidth.
The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of erroneous
detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when
input is only noise.
#### 8.4.1.1 Minimum requirement
The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.
### 8.4.2 PRACH detection requirements
The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several error
cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not
detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong
timing estimation. For AWGN, a timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 1.04us.
For ETU70 and EPA1, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error
of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 2.08us. The strongest path
for the timing estimation error refers to the strongest path (i.e. average of
the delay of all paths having the same highest gain = 310ns for ETU) in the
power delay profile.
The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.6-1 and the test
preambles for high speed mode are listed in A.6-2. The test preambles for
coverage enhancement are listed in table A.6-3.
#### 8.4.2.1 Minimum requirements
The probability of detection shall be equal to or exceed 99% for the SNR
levels listed in Tables 8.4.2.1-1 to 8.4.2.1-4.
The requirements for Burst format 4 are optional and only valid for base
stations supporting TDD. The requirements for high speed mode (table
8.4.2.1-2) are only valid for the base stations supporting high speed mode.
The requirements for coverage enhancement (Tables 8.4.2.1-3 and 8.4.2.1-4) are
only valid for the base stations supporting coverage enhancement.

## 8.5 Performance requirements for Narrowband IoT
### 8.5.1 Requirements for NPUSCH format 1
#### 8.5.1.1 Requirements
The performance requirement of NPUSCH format 1 is determined by a minimum
required throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A16. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.
An NB-IoT Base Station supports 15 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements, or
3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements, or both.
For 15kHz subcarrier spacing single-subcarrier/multi-subcarrier, the
demodulation requirements apply for the supported number of subcarriers.

### 8.5.2 Performance requirements for NPUSCH format 2
#### 8.5.2.1 DTX to ACK performance
The DTX to ACK probability for NPUSCH format 2 case denotes the probability
that ACK is detected when nothing is sent on the wanted signal and only the
noise is present per NPUSCH format 2 transmission.
An NB-IoT Base Station supports 15 KHz sub-carrier spacing requirements, or
3.75 KHz sub-carrier spacing requirements, or both.
##### 8.5.2.1.1 Minimum requirement
The DTX to ACK probability, i.e. the probability that ACK is detected when
nothing was sent, shall not exceed 1% per NPUSCH format 2 transmission. Where
the performance measure definition is as follows:
where:
\- #(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits.
\- #(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of HARQ-ACK information bit per NPUSCH
format 2 transmission.
\- #( NPUSCH format 2 DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions.
#### 8.5.2.2 ACK missed detection requirements
The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting an
ACK when an ACK was sent per NPUSCH format 2 transmission.
##### 8.5.2.2.1 Minimum requirements
The ACK missed detection probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR given in
table 8.5.2.2.1-1 and table 8.5.2.2.1-2 for 1Tx case.

### 8.5.3 Performance requirements for NPRACH
#### 8.5.3.1 NPRACH False alarm probability
The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas, for
all repetition numbers and for any number of subcarriers.
The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of erroneous
detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when
input is only noise.
##### 8.5.3.1.1 Minimum requirement
The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.
#### 8.5.3.2 NPRACH detection requirements
The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several error
cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not
detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong
timing estimation. A timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of
the timing of the strongest path is larger than 3.646 us. The strongest path
for the timing estimation error refers to the strongest path in the power
delay profile.

###### ## Annex B (normative): Propagation conditions
# B.1 Static propagation condition
The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist for this
propagation model.
# B.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
Tables B.2-1 -- B.2-3 show multi-path delay profiles that are used for the
performance measurements in multi-path fading environment. All taps have
classical Doppler spectrum, defined as:
(CLASS) {width="1.7791666666666666in" height="0.2513888888888889in"} for _f_ ∈

A multipath fading propagation condition is defined by a combination of a
multi-path delay profile and a maximum Doppler frequency _f~D~_ which is
either 5, 70 or 300 Hz. In addidion, 200 Hz Doppler frequency is specified for
UL timing adjustment performance requirement.
For carrier aggregation requirements, the fading of the signals for each
carrier shall be independent.
# B.3 High speed train condition
High speed train conditions are as follows:
> Scenario 1: Open space
>
> Scenario 3: Tunnel for multi-antennas
The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance are
two non-fading propagation channels in both scenarios. For BS with Rx
diversity defined in scenario 1, the Doppler shift variation is the same
between antennas.
Doppler shift for both scenarios is given by:
(B.3.1)
where is the Doppler shift and is the maximum Doppler frequency. The cosine of
angle is given by:
, (B.3.2)
, (B.3.3)
, (B.3.4)
where is the initial distance of the train from BS, and is BS-Railway track
distance, both in meters; is the velocity of the train in m/s, is time in
seconds.
Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equation B.3.1 and B.3.2-B.3.4
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in table B.3-1 and
the resulting Doppler shift shown in Figure B.3-1 and B.3-2 are applied for
all frequency bands.

# B.4 Moving propagation conditions
Figure B.4-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test of the
UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the reference
timing and the first tap is according Equation (B.4-1). The timing difference
between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ - (_T~A~_ −31)×16 _T~s~_.
The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving
propagation conditions are shown in Table B.4-1.

for Band 1 with additional rounding applied to the Doppler frequency
calculated for the specified UE speed.
NOTE 2: In Scenario 2, Doppler shift is not taken into account.
# B.5 Multi-Antenna channel models
The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in B.5 apply for the antenna
configuration using uniform linear arrays at both UE and eNodeB.
## B.5.1 Definition of MIMO Correlation Matrices
Table B.5.1-1 defines the correlation matrix for the eNodeB:

UE Correlation
Table B.5.1-3 defines the channel spatial correlation matrix{width="0.33125in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}. The parameters _α_ and _β_ in Table B.5.1-3
defines the spatial correlation between the antennas at the eNodeB and UE
respectively.

{width="0.33125in" height="0.2513888888888889in"} according to .
## B.5.2 MIMO Correlation Matrices at High, Medium and Low Level
The {width="0.16597222222222222in" height="0.15347222222222223in"} and
{width="0.16597222222222222in" height="0.22083333333333333in"} for different
correlation types are given in Table B.5.2-1.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are defined in
Table B.5.2-2, B.5.2-3 and B.5.2-4 as below.
The values in Table B.5.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4 high
correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite
after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using the equation:
Where the value "a" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value is used
to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a=0.00012.
The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in Table
B.5.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite after
round-off to 4 digit precision with a =0.00012.

# B.5A Multi-Antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas
The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in B.5A apply to two cases as
presented below:
\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized antennas
used at eNodeB
\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at both UE and eNodeB

angles are deployed at eNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna element with +90
degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For multiple TX antennas
case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0 degrees polarization slant
angles are deployed at UE.
For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for the
other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number of TX or
RX antennas.

# B.6 Interference model for enhanced performance requirements type A
This clause provides a description for the modelling of interfering UE
transmissions for enhanced performance requirements type A including:
definition of dominant interferer proportion, interference model for
synchronous scenario and interference model for asynchronous scenario.
## B.6.1 Dominant interferer proportion
Each interferer involved in enhanced performance requirements type A is
characterized by its associated dominant interferer proportion (DIP) value:
( = 1,..., )
where is the received energy from the _i_ -th strongest interferer involved in
the requirement scenario and where is the the energy of the white noise source
consistent with the definition provided in subclause 8.1 and is the total
number of simultaneously transmitted interferers involved in a given
requirement scenario.
## B.6.2 Interference model for synchronous scenario
This subclause provides interference modelling for each explicitly modelled
interferer in the requirement scenario where the interferer(s) are time-
synchronous with the tested signal.
In each subframe, each interferer shall transmit 16QAM randomly modulated data
over the entire PUSCH region and the full transmission bandwidth. Demodulation
reference signal, configured according to Table 8.2.6-1, is transmitted
associated with the transmission of PUSCH.
## B.6.3 Interference model for asynchronous scenario
This subclause provides interference modelling for each explicitly modelled
interferer in the requirement scenario where the interferer(s) are time-
asynchronous with the tested signal.
Two interfering UEs from the same interfering cell, named interferer 1-1 and
interferer 1-2, are modelled. Interferer 1-1 and interferer 1-2 shall transmit
16QAM randomly modulated data over the entire PUSCH region and the full
transmission bandwidth, respectively in the even subframes and odd subframes,
as illustrated in Figure B.6.3-1. Demodulation reference signal, configured
according to Table 8.2.6A-1, is transmitted associated with the transmission
of PUSCH. The transmissions of both interferer 1-1 and interferer 1-2 are
delayed with respect to the tested signal by 0.33 ms.

test conditions except where otherwise stated. For guidance on the use of test
conditions to be used in order to show compliance refer to TS 36.141.
###### ## Annex E (normative): Error Vector Magnitude
# E.1 Reference point for measurement
The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing (ZF)
equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in Figure E.1-1 below.
Figure E.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement
# E.2 Basic unit of measurement
The basic unit of EVM measurement is defined over one subframe (1ms) in the
time domain and subcarriers (180kHz) in the frequency domain:
where
is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active
within the subframe,
is the set of subcarriers within the subcarriers with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol _t_ ,
_is_ the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in accordance
with relevant Tx models,
is the modified signal under test defined in E.3.
Note: Although the basic unit of measurement is one subframe, the equalizer is
calculated over 10 subframe measurement periods to reduce the impact of noise
in the reference symbols. The boundaries of the 10 subframe measurement
periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.
# E.3 Modified signal under test
Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is able
to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under test is
equalised and decoded according to:
where
is the time domain samples of the signal under test.
is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in relation
to nominal timing of the ideal signal. Note that two timing offsets are
determined, the corresponding EVM is measured and the maximum used as
described in E.7.

ms.
In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of length

is estimated so that the EVM window of length is centred on the measured
cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol. To minimize the estimation error
the timing shall be based on the primary synchronization signal and reference
signals. To limit time distortion of any transmit filter the reference signals
in the 1 outer RBs are not taken into account in the timing estimation
Two values for are determined:
and
where if is odd and if is even.
When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol (e.g. time
multiplexed MBMS and unicast) then shall be further restricted to the subset
of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active and with the
considered cyclic prefix length type.
## E.5.1 Window length
Table E.5.1-1 and Table E.5.1-1a below specify EVM window length (W) for
normal CP, the cyclic prefix length is 160 for symbols 0 and 144 for symbols
1-6.

# E.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters
The equalizer coefficients and are determined as follows:
1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal and the post-FFT Ideal signal , for each reference symbol,
over 10 subframes. This process creates a set of complex ratios:
Where the post-FFT Ideal signal is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following parameters:
restricted content: i.e. nominal Reference Symbols and the Primary
Synchronisation Channel, (all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),
nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable
subcarrier, nominal timing.
2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the complex
ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 subframes. Prior to the averaging of
the phases an unwrap operation must be performed according to the following
definition: The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of by adding
multiples of 2*PI when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances
t~i~ are greater then or equal to the jump tolerance of PI radians. This
process creates an average amplitude and phase for each reference signal
subcarrier (i.e. every third subcarrier with the exception of the reference
subcarrier spacing across the DC subcarrier).
Where _N_ is the number of reference symbol time-domain locations _t~i~_ from
Z'(f,t) for each reference signal subcarrier .
3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase and at the reference
signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving average in the
frequency domain of the time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every
third subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19. For reference
subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel the window size is reduced
accordingly as per figure E.6-1.
4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients and to
compute coefficients , for each subcarrier.
Figure E.6-1: Reference subcarrier smoothing in the frequency domain
# E.7 Averaged EVM
EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of 10
downlink subframes:
For FDD the averaging in the time domain equals the 10 subframe duration of
the 10 subframes measurement period from the equalizer estimation step.
For TDD the averaging in the time domain can be calculated from subframes of
different frames and should have a minimum of 10 subframes averaging length.
TDD special fields (DwPTS and GP) are not included in the averaging.
_Where Ni_ is the number of resource blocks with the considered modulation
scheme in subframe _i_ and _N~dl~_ is the number of allocated downlink
subframes in one frame.
The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS average at
the window W extremities of the EVM measurements:
Thus is calculated using in the expressions above and is calculated using in
the calculation.
Thus we get:
The averaged EVM with the minimum averaging length of at least 10 subframes is
then achieved by further averaging of the results

###### ## Annex F (Informative): Unwanted emission requirements for multi-
carrier BS
# F.1 General
In subclause 6.6, unwanted emission requirements for single carrier or multi-
carrier BS are specified. This multi-carrier BS corresponds to a multi-carrier
BS for E-UTRA, or a BS supporting intra-band contiguous CA. The following two
pragmatic scenarios are considered in this annex:
\- multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths, covering all
scenarios except the channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier less than 5
MHz
\- multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA, covering all scenarios except the
channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier less than 5 MHz.
All scenarios for channel bandwidths of the outermost carrier less than 5 MHz
are for further study. The guidelines below assumes that the power spectral
density of the multiple carriers is the same. All other combinations of
multiple carriers are ffs.
Note 1: Further information and analysis for these scenarios can be found in
TR 36.942 [9].
# F.2 Multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths
For a multi-carrier E-UTRA BS transmitting a group of carriers of different
channel bandwidths, the channel bandwidth of the outermost carriers (≥5 MHz)
should be considered for ACLR and Operating band unwanted emission
requirements. That is, the corresponding requirements for the channel
bandwidth of each of the outermost carriers should be applied at the
respective side of the group of transmitted carriers.
# F.3 Multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA
For a multi-carrier BS transmitting a group of carriers of E-UTRA and UTRA,
the RAT being used on the outermost carriers (≥5 MHz) should be considered for
ACLR and Operating band unwanted emission requirements. That is, the
corresponding requirements for the RAT being used on each of the outermost
carriers should be applied at the respective side of the group of transmitted
carriers.
###### ## * *Annex G (Informative): Regional requirement for protection of DTT
# G.1 Regional requirement for protection of DTT
The European Communications Committee (ECC) has adopted the "ECC Decision on
harmonised conditions for Mobile/Fixed Communications Networks operating in
the band 790-862 MHz" [12] applicable for BS operating in band 20. The
decision defines a requirement for "Out-of-block BEM baseline requirements for
'mobile/fixed communications network' (MFCN) base stations within the spectrum
allocated to the broadcasting (DTT) service", where three different cases A,
B, and C for protecting broadcasting DTT are defined. These cases can be
applied on a per-channel and/or per-region basis, i.e. for the same channel
different cases can be applied in different geographic areas (e.g. area
related to DTT coverage) and different cases can be applied to different
channels in the same geographic area.
For band 20, compliance with the regulatory requirements in Europe referenced
above can be assessed based on the manufacturer's declaration of P~EM,N~
specified in subclause 6.6.3.3, together with the deployment characteristics.
Maximum output Power in 10 MHz (P~10MHz~) is also declared by the
manufacturer. The parameters G~ant~ and N~ant~ are deployment specific
parameters related to the deployment of the BS, where G~ant~ is the antenna
gain and N~ant~ is the number of antennas.
For each channel (N) the EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP,N~ = P~EM,N~ +
G~ant~ + 10*log(N~ant~ ). The regulatory requirement in [12] limits the EIRP
level to the Maximum level in Table G-1 for the protection case(s) defined in
the regulation.

\"P~EIRP~\" is the resulting effective isotropic radiated power (or radiated
power spectral density) resulting from the power (or power spectral density)

manufacturer in dBm (or dBm/measurement BW)
\"G~Ant~\" is the effective antenna gain, calculated as the antenna gain (dBi)
minus the loss of the site infrastructure connecting the BS antenna connector
with the antenna (dB) for the applied frequency. The antenna nominal gain is
only applicable within a certain frequency range.
