# Introduction
A study item, "Study on Licensed-Assisted Access Using LTE", was approved at
3GPP TSG RAN #65 [2]. This study is to evaluate LTE enhancements for a single
global solution framework for licensed-assisted access (LAA) to unlicensed
spectrum. Complementary access using the unlicensed band would be supported by
licensed operation, the quality of which can never be matched by unlicensed
operation. The objectives of the study include:
\- the definition of an evaluation methodology,
\- the possible scenarios for LTE deployments focusing on LTE carrier
aggregation,
\- the documentation of the relevant requirements and design targets for
unlicensed spectrum deployment,
\- the identification and evaluation of the physical layer options and
enhancements to LTE to meet the requirements and targets for unlicensed
spectrum deployments,
\- the identification and evaluation of any enhancements needed to LTE RAN
protocols and an assessment of the feasibility of base station and terminal
operation in the 5 GHz band in conjunction with relevant licensed frequency
bands.
The results and findings of the study are documented in this technical report.
# 1 Scope
The present document contains the results and findings from the study item,
"Study on Licensed-Assisted Access Using LTE" [2]. The purpose of this TR is
to document the identified LTE enhancements and corresponding evaluations for
a single global solution framework for licensed-assisted access to unlicensed
spectrum. Dual connectivity and standalone access to unlicensed spectrum are
not part of the study. _Therefore, for LAA operation, a carrier in an
unlicensed band cannot be configured as a PCell/PSCell in this Rel-13 study._
This document addresses evaluation methodology and possible scenarios for LTE
deployments, focusing on LTE Carrier Aggregation configurations.
This technical report documents the existing regulatory requirements for
unlicensed spectrum deployment in the 5GHz bands.
This document identifies and defines design targets for coexistence with other
unlicensed spectrum deployments, including fairness with respect to Wi-Fi and
other LAA services.
This document identifies and captures coexistence evaluations of physical
layer options and enhancements to LTE and, if necessary, LTE RAN protocols to
meet the requirements and targets for unlicensed spectrum deployments.
This document contains an assessment of the feasibility of base station and
terminal operation of 5GHz band (based on regulatory limits) in conjunction
with relevant licensed frequency bands.
This document is a 'living' document, i.e. it is permanently updated and
presented to TSG-RAN meetings.

# 4 Regulatory requirements
The range 5150-5925 MHz, or parts thereof, is potentially available for
license-assisted access to unlicensed operation. This represents a significant
amount of spectrum that can be used by operators to augment their service
offerings in licensed bands. The range above can be operated under a license-
exempt regime or ISM but must be shared with existing mobile services and
other incumbent services. The quality of service offered by a licensed regime
can therefore not be matched. Hence, unlicensed access is viewed as
complementary, and does not reduce the need for additional allocations for
licensed operation in view of the increased demand for wireless broadband
access.
It is relevant to consider the global (International) ITU-R allocations and
technical provisions first. These could be basis for defining globally
harmonised bands for LAA and starting points for requirements and limits
before the local variations are considered.
**[5150-5350 and 5470-5725 MHz]{.underline}**
WRC 2003 allocated the bands 5 150-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz on a co-
primary basis to the mobile service for the implementation of "wireless access
systems (WAS), including radio local area networks (RLANs)". This was subject
to technical and regulatory provisions included in the radio regulations given
in Resolution 229 (WRC-03), which was subsequently revised at WRC-12 to
Resolution 229 (Rev. WRC-12) [38]. These provisions are followed by many
Administrations and resolves:
1) that the use of these bands by the mobile service will be for the
implementation of WAS, including RLANs, as described in the most recent
version of Recommendation ITU‑R M.1450;
2) that in the band 5 150-5 250 MHz, stations in the mobile service shall be
restricted to indoor use with a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 200 mW and a maximum
mean e.i.r.p. density of 10 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band or equivalently 0.25
mW/25 kHz in any 25 kHz band;
3) that administrations may monitor whether the aggregate pfd levels given in
Recommendation ITU‑R S.1426 have been, or will be exceeded in the future, in
order to enable a future competent conference to take appropriate action;
4) that in the band 5 250-5 350 MHz, stations in the mobile service shall be
limited to a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 200 mW and a maximum mean e.i.r.p.
density of 10 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band. Administrations are requested to take
appropriate measures that will result in the predominant number of stations in
the mobile service being operated in an indoor environment. Furthermore,
stations in the mobile service that are permitted to be used either indoors or
outdoors may operate up to a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 1 W and a maximum mean
e.i.r.p. density of 50 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band, and, when operating above a
mean e.i.r.p. of 200 mW, these stations shall comply with the following
e.i.r.p. elevation angle mask where θ is the angle above the local horizontal
plane (of the Earth):
\--13 dB(W/MHz) for 0° [\ 15° For P-MP Customer Terminal Station and P-P
deployments:  
−7 dB(W/MHz) for 0° ≤ θ \ 50°

**[Interference to Weather Radars]{.underline}**
Interference to Weather Radars is also a hot topic in the EU. The two last
versions of EN 301 893 (1.6.1 and 1.7.1) have included amendments to better
protect these radars, like the prohibition to give the user access to the
configuration control settings that would allow him to disconnect the DFS
functionality.
The use of the band 5.60-5.65 GHz by WLANs is allowed in Europe, and a Market
Surveillance campaign on WLANs 5 GHz has been led at EU level by the ADCO
R&TTE Group. The report [20] of the campaign has proposed specific
recommendations to improve the situation. These recommendations do not require
amendments to the last version of EN 301 893.

## 4.2 ITU Region 2
### 4.2.1 USA
The use of unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum in USA is governed by FCC part 15
regulations [3]. In Feb 2013, potential new rules were proposed in FCC 13-22
[4]. Figure 4.2.1-1 summarizes the relevant part 15 rules for 5GHz unlicensed
spectrum usage:
{width="6.684027777777778in" height="1.0604166666666666in"}
Figure 4.2.1-1 : Summary of existing and proposed new FCC part 15 rules for
5GHz unlicensed spectrum usage
In Figure 4.2.1-1, U-NII-x bands denote frequency bands for Unlicensed
National Information Infrastructure devices usage that are governed by §15.407
[3]. As shown in the figure, there is also an overlapping ruling of §15.247
from 5.725 to 5.85 GHz. A device could choose to follow either U-NII rulings
or §15.247 rulings when operating within the frequency range.
In the rest of this section, we summarize FCC paragraphs 15.407 and 15.247
rules. In general either frequency hopping or digital modulation techniques
are permitted under part 15 rules. Since LTE is not designed as a frequency
hopping system, the rest of the document will focus on regulations related to
digital modulation.
Paragraph 15.247 rules relevant for LTE point to multi-point communications
are summarized in 4 aspects:
\- Transmission Bandwidth:
\- The minimum 6 dB bandwidth shall be at least 500 kHz.
\- Maximum Transmit Power:
\- Peak conducted output power shall not exceed 1 W. An alternative to peak
power measurements is maximum conducted output power, which is the total
transmit power over all antennas and antenna elements when the transmitter is
operating at its maximum power control level.
\- Note that, the conducted output power limit is based on the use of antennas
with directional gains that do not exceed 6 dBi. If transmitting antennas of
directional gain greater than 6 dBi are used, the conducted output power from
the intentional radiator shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the
directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
\- Out of Band Emission:
\- In any 100 kHz bandwidth outside the frequency band, the radio frequency
power that is produced by the intentional radiator shall be at least 20 dB
below that in the 100 kHz bandwidth within the band that contains the highest
level of the desired power, based on either an RF conducted or a radiated
measurement. If the transmitter complies with the conducted power limits based
on the use of RMS averaging over a time interval, the attenuation required
under this paragraph shall be 30 dB instead of 20 dB.
\- Power Spectrum Density:
\- The power spectral density conducted from the intentional radiator to the
antenna shall not be greater than 8 dBm in any 3 kHz band during any time
interval of continuous transmission. The same method of determining the
conducted output power shall be used to determine the power spectral density.
Paragraph15.407 rules for UNII devices are summarized in following tables. In
Table 4.2.1-1, the maximum transmit power, PSD and out of band emission
requirements are listed for UNII-1/2/3 bands. In Table 4.2.1-2, the dynamic
frequency selection requirements for radar detection are summarized for UNII-2
devices.

### 4.3.6 Singapore
In Singapore the bands 5150-5250 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz, 5470-5725MHz and
5725-5850 MHz are open to RLANs.
### 4.3.7 Australia
In Australia the band bands 5150-5250 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz and 5470-5725 MHz,
except the sub-band 5600-5650 MHz, are open to RLANs. DFS and TPC are
mandatory in the bands 5250-5350 MHz and 5470-5725 MHz.
## 4.4 Applicability of DFS requirements
The concept surfaced around 2001 in the ECC for handling uniform spread of
WLAN interference into satellite and radar services, but was soon extended to
include methods for discovery and avoidance of frequencies used by the radar
service in the preparation work for WRC 2003.
Use of DFS in accordance with Annex 1 of ITU-R Recommendation M.1652 [39] is
mandated as per Resolution 229 [38]. The 5 GHz Harmonized European Standard
developed by ETSI TC BRAN was the first to include these DFS rules (EN 301 893
V1.2.3 in 2003), the DFS test specification included in this standard
therefore became the basis for the development of the FCC DFS test
specification and other test specifications in other countries.
For LAA, it appears that conformance testing would only have to be performed
for the BS. Already at the outset in ITU-R M.1652 it was made clear that full
DFS functionality may not have to be implemented in all devices, only those
controlling the transmission [39]:
**2.1 Detection requirements**
The DFS mechanism should be able to detect interference signals above a
minimum DFS detection threshold of --62 dBm for devices with a maximum
e.i.r.p. of \ (2) Radar Detection Function of Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS). U-NII
> devices operating with any part of its 26 dB emission bandwidth in the
> 5.25-5.35 GHz and 5.47-5.725 GHz bands shall employ a DFS radar detection
> mechanism to detect the presence of radar systems and to avoid co-channel
> operation with radar systems. Operators shall only use equipment with a DFS
> mechanism that is turned on when operating in these bands. The device must
> sense for radar signals at 100 percent of its emission bandwidth. The
> minimum DFS detection threshold for devices with a maximum e.i.r.p. [...]
>
> (i) Operational Modes. The DFS requirement applies to the following
> operational modes:
>
> (A) The requirement for channel availability check time applies in the
> master operational mode.
>
> (B) The requirement for channel move time applies in both the master and
> slave operational modes.
>
> (ii) Channel Availability Check Time. A U-NII device shall check if there is
> a radar system already operating on the channel before it can initiate a
> transmission on a channel and when it has to move to a new channel. The
> U-NII device may start using the channel if no radar signal with a power
> level greater than the interference threshold values listed in paragraph
> (h)(2) of this section, is detected within 60 seconds.
>
> (iii) Channel Move Time. After a radar\'s presence is detected, all
> transmissions shall cease on the operating channel within 10 seconds.
> Transmissions during this period shall consist of normal traffic for a
> maximum of 200 ms after detection of the radar signal. In addition,
> intermittent management and control signals can be sent during the remaining
> time to facilitate vacating the operating channel.
Similar to the ETSI BRAN harmonized standard, there is also a requirement that
"the device must sense for radar signals at 100 percent of its emission
bandwidth". In deriving the minimum DFS detection threshold for the WAS
receiver, it was assumed that above this threshold the emissions within the
RLAN bandwidth would desensitize the radar receiver. Reciprocity was thus
assumed, the WAS should be able to detect a radar within its emission
bandwidth. The bandwidth of the WAS affects the probability of detecting a
radar signal and its side lobes and the probability of causing interference
(the WAS emissions).
# 5 Spectrum considerations and LAA carrier aggregation feasibility study
## 5.1 Licensed spectrum needs for LAA
The amount of data traffic carried over cellular networks is expected to
increase for many years to come. The number of users/devices is increasing and
each user/device accesses an increasing number and variety of services, e.g.
video delivery. This requires not only high capacity in the network, but also
provisioning very high data rates to meet customers' expectations on
interactivity and responsiveness. More spectrum is therefore needed for
cellular operators to meet the increasing demand. Considering user
expectations of high data rates along with seamless mobility, it is important
that more spectrum be made available for deploying macro cells as well as
small cells for cellular systems.
The preferred type of spectrum to efficiently serve users is licensed
spectrum. Licensed spectrum can deliver predictable high-quality services with
the highest spectral efficiency. In addition, in order to deliver predictable
services, mobile operators perform heavy network investments, through careful
planning and deployment of high-quality network equipment and devices. The
justifications for such extensive capital investments require the reliability
and operational assurance enabled by licensed spectrum. It is therefore
essential that the regulatory community keeps focusing on identifying and
allocating new licensed spectrum that can be utilized specifically for mobile
communications.
Striving to meet the market demands, there has been increasing interest from
operators in deploying some complementary access utilizing unlicensed spectrum
to meet the traffic growth. This is exemplified by the large number of
operator-deployed Wi-Fi networks and the 3GPP standardization of LTE/WLAN
interworking solutions. This interest indicates that unlicensed spectrum, when
present, can be an effective complement to licensed spectrum for cellular
operators to help addressing the traffic explosion in some scenarios, such as
hotspot areas. LAA offers an alternative for operators to make use of
unlicensed spectrum while managing one radio network, thus offering new
possibilities for optimizing the network's efficiency.
However, it is clear that unlicensed spectrum can never match the quality of
the licensed spectrum regime. Unlicensed spectrum can never replace the need
for more licensed spectrum due to its inability to be used in macro cells
providing wide-area coverage and its general inability to provide highly
robust quality-of-service due to the uncontrolled interference. Therefore,
unlicensed spectrum is better used as "Licensed-Assisted Access" integrated
into LTE, where it is considered as a secondary component carrier in a carrier
aggregation scenario.
Since the primary component carrier in licensed spectrum will be used to carry
some (or all) of the control signal (and possibly also data, e.g.
retransmissions) of the traffic carried over the carrier in unlicensed
spectrum, the use of unlicensed spectrum also increases the need for more
licensed spectrum. Such need will be most obvious in deployment scenarios such
as carrier aggregation between a macro cell operating in licensed spectrum and
clusters of many small cells (remote radio heads) operating only in large
chunks of unlicensed spectrum, i.e. deployment scenario 1 in Section 6.
Furthermore, since a standalone access to unlicensed spectrum is not part of
the study, the traffic increase will have to be supported by more network
access capacity in licensed bands, e.g. using more licensed spectrum.
Thus, the use of LTE in unlicensed spectrum can serve as a useful additional
tool by operators to maximize the value they can provide to users, while the
core of the activity of the operators remains anchored to the licensed
spectrum.
## 5.2 LAA carrier aggregation feasibility study
### 5.2.1 Feasibility of UE operation
For 5GHz spectrum available for WAS/RLAN, regulatory requirements such as
allowed transmit output power or TPC requirements need to be taken into
account.
Technical analysis shows that it is reasonable to assume one single front end
filter in UE implementation to cover the entire 5GHz spectrum. This does not
preclude consideration of other implementation options in the WI phase. For
aggregating carrier in unlicensed 5GHz band for inter-band CA, there exists
some UE RF architecture that could be feasible.
Overall, it is feasible for UEs to operate in the 5GHz unlicensed spectrum. RF
requirements should be specified in the WI phase taking into account issues
including implementation complexity and performance.
### 5.2.2 Feasibility of BS operation
While BS implementation considerations may be different from those of UE in
terms of performance, implementation complexity, and fair access to the
unlicensed carriers in the presence of WiFi, there are no major issues
reported during the study.
It is noted that to enable fair access between LAA BS and WiFi AP/STAs, some
LAA BS RF requirements may require further study in the WI phase.
In summary, it is feasible for BSs to operate in 5GHz unlicensed spectrum. RF
requirements should be specified in the WI phase taking into account issues
including implementation complexity and performance.
## 5.3 Band definition for unlicensed operation of LTE in 5GHz spectrum
### 5.3.1 Band range
Since the allocations in the spectrum starts at 5150MHz and the highest
allocation in this spectrum is up to 5925 MHz, the conclusion of the study is
to define 5 GHz unlicensed LAA band or bands within frequency limits 5150 --
5925 MHz. This ensures that all markets are included in the band(s)
definition.
### 5.3.2 Suitable duplex method for unlicensed bands
The study considered both DL-only transmission and DL+UL transmission
scenarios. In case of eNB operating DL+UL LAA over the same carrier in
unlicensed spectrum, the DL transmission burst(s) and UL transmission burst(s)
on LAA can be scheduled in a TDM manner while any instant in time can be part
of a DL transmission burst or an UL transmission burst, which is different
from existing Frame Structure type 2 (FS2). Potential duplex methods for LAA
operation may consider both DL-only and/or DL+UL transmission depending on the
outcome of potential WI. Since the duplex method is tied to frame structure,
the duplex method for 5GHz unlicensed band shall be based on the physical
layer design on L1 enhancements for LAA.
### 5.3.3 UE RF devices for 5GHz band
LAA is operating on unlicensed spectrum where Wi-Fi and other systems may also
be operating in the same unlicensed spectrum, and where almost all smart
phones are implementing Wi-Fi. A low cost implementation of LAA UE is
desirable. In that sense, it might be reasonable to utilize the common UE RF
devices available across the entire frequency from 5150 to 5925 MHz unless
some other problematic issues are identified. Note that it is also true that
in this very high frequency range, it would be quite challenging to obtain
small pass-bandwidth filter with sharp attenuations at the edges.
In conclusion for LAA UE, it is recommended that radio requirements should be
specified such that a single filter implementation for UE across the entire
frequency range from 5150 to 5925 MHz is possible. Other implementations are
not precluded.
# 6 Deployment scenarios for LAA
This section describes possible deployment scenarios for LAA. In this study
item, LAA targets the carrier aggregation operation in which one or more low
power SCells operate in unlicensed spectrum. LAA deployment scenarios
encompass scenarios with and without macro coverage, both outdoor and indoor
small cell deployments, and both co-location and non-co-location (with ideal
backhaul) between licensed and unlicensed carriers. Figure 6-1 shows four LAA
deployment scenarios, where the number of licensed carriers and the number of
unlicensed carriers can be one or more. Though the backhaul between small
cells can be ideal or non-ideal, the unlicensed small cell only operates in
the context of the carrier aggregation through ideal backhaul with a licensed
cell. In scenarios where carrier aggregation is operated within the small cell
with carriers in both the licensed and unlicensed bands, the backhaul between
macro cell and small cell can be ideal or non-ideal.

Figure 6-1: LAA deployment scenarios
\- Scenario 1
\- Carrier aggregation between licensed macro cell (F1) and unlicensed small
cell (F3)
\- Scenario 2
\- Carrier aggregation between licensed small cell (F2) and unlicensed small
cell (F3) without macro cell coverage
\- Scenario 3
\- Licensed macro cell and small cell (F1), with carrier aggregation between
licensed small cell (F1) and unlicensed small cell (F3)
\- Scenario 4
\- Licensed macro cell (F1), licensed small cell (F2) and unlicensed small
cell (F3)
\- Carrier aggregation between licensed small cell (F2) and unlicensed small
cell (F3)
\- If there is ideal backhaul between macro cell and small cell, there can be
carrier aggregation between macro cell (F1), licensed small cell (F2) and
unlicensed small cell (F3)
\- If dual connectivity is enabled, there can be dual connectivity between
macro cell and small cell.
In the study to support deployment in unlicensed spectrum for the above
scenarios, CA functionalities are used as a baseline to aggregate PCell/PSCell
on licensed carrier and SCell on unlicensed carrier. When non-ideal backhaul
is applied between a Macro cell and a small cell cluster in Scenarios 3 and 4,
a small cell on an unlicensed carrier has to be aggregated with a small cell
on a licensed carrier in the small cell cluster through ideal backhaul. One
aim of this report is to identify the need of and, if necessary, evaluate
needed enhancements to the LTE RAN protocols applicable to carrier aggregation
in all of the above scenarios.
# 7 Design targets, functionalities and solutions for LAA
## 7.1 Design targets and functionalities
The design targets of an LAA system are listed below:
\- A single global solution framework allowing compliance with any regional
regulatory requirements
A single global solution framework for LAA should be defined to ensure that
LAA can be operated according to any regional regulatory requirements.
Furthermore, LAA design should provide sufficient configurability to enable
efficient operation in different geographical regions.
\- Effective and fair coexistence with Wi-Fi.
The LAA design should target fair coexistence with existing Wi-Fi networks to
not impact Wi-Fi services more than an additional Wi-Fi network on the same
carrier, with respect to throughput and latency.
\- Effective and fair coexistence among LAA networks deployed by different
operators
The LAA design should target fair coexistence among LAA networks deployed by
different operators so that the LAA networks can achieve comparable
performance, with respect to throughput and latency.
Based on the design targets, at least the following functionalities are
required for an LAA system:
_\- Listen-before-talk_ (Clear channel assessment)
The listen-before-talk (LBT) procedure is defined as a mechanism by which an
equipment applies a clear channel assessment (CCA) check before using the
channel. The CCA utilizes at least energy detection to determine the presence
or absence of other signals on a channel in order to determine if a channel is
occupied or clear, respectively. European and Japanese regulations mandate the
usage of LBT in the unlicensed bands. Apart from regulatory requirements,
carrier sensing via LBT is one way for fair sharing of the unlicensed spectrum
and hence it is considered to be a vital feature for fair and friendly
operation in the unlicensed spectrum in a single global solution framework.
\- Discontinuous transmission on a carrier with limited maximum transmission
duration
In unlicensed spectrum, channel availibility cannot always be guaranteed. In
addition, certain regions such as Europe and Japan prohibit continuous
transmission and impose limits on the maximum duration of a transmission burst
in the unlicensed spectrum. Hence, discontinuous transmission with limited
maximum transmission duration is a required functionality for LAA.
_\- Dynamic frequency selection_ for radar avoidance in certain bands/regions
Dynamic frequency selection (DFS) is a regulatory requirement for some
frequency bands, e.g., to detect interference from radar systems and to avoid
co-channel operation with these systems by selecting a different carrier on a
relatively slow time scale. This requirement does not need new specifications.
\- Carrier selection
As there is a large available bandwidth of unlicensed spectrum, carrier
selection is required for LAA nodes to select the carriers with low
interference and with that achieve good co-existence with other unlicensed
spectrum deployments.
\- Transmit Power Control
Transmit Power Control (TPC) is a regulatory requirement in some regions by
which the transmitting device should be able to reduce the transmit power in a
proportion of 3dB or 6dB compared to the maximum nominal transmit power. This
requirement does not need new specifications.
\- RRM measurements including cell identification
Radio resource management (RRM) measurements including cell identification
enable mobility between SCells and robust operation in the unlicensed band.
\- AGC setting
\- Coarse synchronization
\- Fine frequency/time estimation at least for demodulation
\- Channel-State Information (CSI) measurement, including channel and
interference
Automatic Gain Control (AGC) setting, coarse synchronization, fine
frequency/time estimation at least for demodulation, and CSI measurements
including measurements of channel and interference are necessary for
performing RRM measurements and for successful reception of information on the
unlicensed band.
It is noted that not all above functionalities may have a specification
impact.
The PHY layer options considered for LAA have at least the following
characteristics:
\- Support for at least 20MHz system BW option in the 5GHz band
\- System bandwidths \2) allocation (e.g. RBs/subcarriers spaced uniformly in
frequency) has been identified as a candidate waveform that satisfies
regulatory requirements and maximizes coverage._ For this candidate waveform,
the following aspects need to be addressed. identified below.
\- Number of clusters needed
\- Size of each cluster
\- Spacing between clusters or subcarriers
It is also recommended that SRS transmissions be supported in LAA. The Rel-12
design allows for two cases from a UE point a view, i.e., SRS either
transmitted with a PUSCH transmission or transmitted separately from a PUSCH
transmission. It is recommended that SRS transmissions are supported for an
LAA SCell at least along with a PUSCH transmission.
In addition, it is recommended that LAA should target the support of **UL
multiplexing of multiple UEs in one subframe** by multiplexing in the
frequency domain and by multiplexing using MU-MIMO.
#### 7.2.1.8 Transmission burst
A transmission burst on the DL and UL is defined as follows.
\- Each DL transmission burst is a continuous transmission from a DL
transmitting node with no transmission immediately before or after from the
same node on the same CC.
\- Each UL transmission burst from a UE perspective is a continuous
transmission from a UE with no transmission immediately before or after from
the same UE on the same CC.
Note that the UL transmission burst is defined from a UE perspective and this
does not preclude the possibility of defining a UL transmission burst from an
eNB perspective.
In case of an eNB operating DL+UL LAA over the same unlicensed carrier, DL
transmission burst(s) and UL transmission burst(s) on LAA can be scheduled in
a TDM manner over the same unlicensed carrier. Any instant in time can be part
of a DL transmission burst or an UL transmission burst.
### 7.2.2 Higher layer aspects
#### 7.2.2.1 Random Access (RA)
Contention based RA is not supported. Only contention free random access is
supported on LAA cells if the eNB decides that RA is needed.
If UE is required to perform LBT before UL transmission, the handling of
preamble transmission dropping from Rel-12 Dual Connectivity is used as
baseline for preamble dropping on LAA carriers due to LBT failure.
#### 7.2.2.2 HARQ operation
**[DL HARQ]{.underline}**
The main issue for HARQ operation on an LAA cell is the uncertainty of the
cell availability for HARQ re-transmissions. The uncertainty may arise due to
the LBT operation needed to acquire the channel or because the maximum
transmission duration for LAA has been exceeded. The Figure 7.2.2.2-1
illustrates an example, in which the maximum transmission duration of an LAA
cell has been reached before the 3^rd^ transmission of a HARQ process can be
performed.
Figure 7.2.2.2 - 1: HARQ issue in LAA cell
There may be 2 alternatives to address this issue:
\- Alternative 1: to keep HARQ retransmissions on the same LAA cell
A HARQ process can be targeted (e.g., by choosing an appropriate MCS level) to
be completed within the maximum transmission duration an LAA cell can have. A
new HARQ process is started when the LAA cell acquires the channel again after
an LBT operation. Alternatively, a retransmission can be delayed until the LAA
cell acquires the channel again. RLC retransmission may be invoked, if HARQ
transmission doesn't complete successfully.
\- Alternative 2: to move HARQ retransmissions to another cell
The retransmission may also be performed via another cell, for example, the
primary cell or another SCell. This will change the current modelling of a
HARQ process, as it may be linked to two or more cells.
In terms of the specification impacts and complexity, Alternative 1 is
simpler, as it doesn't incur any new specification impact. Hence, from this
point of view, it is worth considering continuing the principle of Rel-11 CA,
in which downlink HARQ processes are not moved to another carrier.
**[UL HARQ Process Mapping]{.underline}**
In synchronous HARQ, UE identifies in each TTI the HARQ process that is
associated with this TTI. Each TTI has one or two (depending on whether
spatial multiplexing is used) HARQ processes associated with it and for the
identified HARQ processes, the UE will perform a transmission/retransmission.
The association between TTIs and HARQ processes relies on UL HARQ being
synchronous and the association follows from the timing relation: If there has
been an initial transmission in a certain subframe for a certain HARQ process,
then 8 ms later (in FDD), this same HARQ process is considered for
retransmission. The actual HARQ process ID is not specified and the UE is free
to use any numeration. The UE receives HARQ feedback from the eNB on PHICH.
PHICH received in TTI _n_ relates to the transmission in TTI _n-4_. If the UE
receives NACK on PHICH (but does not receive a grant), a non-adaptive
retransmission is triggered automatically.
Asynchronous HARQ is recommended for LAA UL. To enable asynchronous HARQ the
eNB needs to know which HARQ process the UE is using when performing a
transmission/retransmission to know which soft-buffer the received
transmission should be combined with. Hence, the eNB needs to indicate which
HARQ process a grant is for and the redundancy version that should be used so
that the UE uses the correct HARQ process with the correct redundancy version
when performing a transmission or retransmission. Therefore, with the UL
asynchronous HARQ protocol, all transmission or retransmission should be
scheduled via PDCCH or EPDCCH. The process index is indicated in the HARQ
process index field in the UL grant.
**[Number of HARQ Processes]{.underline}**
In TS 36.213 [42] it is defined how many HARQ processes the UE shall support
in DL. For FDD the UE maintains 8 or 16 (depending on whether spatial
multiplexing is used) and for TDD the number of HARQ processes is dependent on
the TDD configuration.
For synchronous UL HARQ, the number of HARQ processes is not explicitly
specified. Instead, the supported number follows from the HARQ timing. For
asynchronous UL HARQ, a maximum number of HARQ processes may need to be
specified. The exact number of UL HARQ processes in the eNB may be left to
implementation.
**[Flushing UL buffer and CURRENT_TX_NB]{.underline}**
In synchronous UL HARQ, the UE is maintaining a counter per HARQ process
(CURRENT_TX_NB) which is increased every time the UE performs a transmission
using the HARQ process. When this counter exceeds a configured value, the UE
will flush the HARQ buffer. In addition, the UE stops non-adaptive
retransmissions when flushing UL buffer. The UE will increase the counter
every HARQ RTT, so this basically translates into the UE having a fixed time
until it flushes the HARQ buffer.
With asynchronous UL HARQ, the UL HARQ buffers may need to be flushed based on
some other mechanism.
**[NDI and Handling of New Transmissions on UL]{.underline}**
In addition to received NDI, triggering of new transmission depends on whether
the UE has data in the UL HARQ buffer or not. In synchronous UL HARQ, if the
UE receives a grant and either NDI has been toggled or the UL HARQ buffer is
empty, the UE triggers a new transmission; otherwise, the UE triggers a
retransmission.
With asynchronous UL HARQ, it may be necessary to update the handling of
triggering of new transmissions.
**[DRX]{.underline}**
When DRX is used, the UE will stay active depending on when the UE can expect
an UL retransmission grant as described in the text below from TS 36.321 [42]:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | When a DRX cycle is configured, the Active Time includes the time | | while: | | | | _[...]_ | | | | - an uplink grant for a pending HARQ retransmission can occur and | | there is data in the corresponding HARQ buffer; or | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
With synchronous UL HARQ it is well defined when the UE can expect to receive
UL grants as the HARQ process is following a fixed pattern. It should be noted
that the UE monitors (E)PDCCH once in every HARQ RTT even if the UE has
received ACK in PHICH. With asynchronous UL HARQ, the UE can no longer know
when to expect grants as the eNB may send them at any point in time. In
addition, if HARQ buffer is not flushed, the UE would never stop monitoring
(E)PDCCH according to current mechanism. Therefore, with asynchronous UL HARQ,
the DRX behaviour needs to be modified.
#### 7.2.2.3 DRX
In CA, the same DRX operation applies to all configured and activated serving
cells (i.e. identical active time for PDCCH monitoring). In other words, there
is a common DRX applied to all the serving cells. The difference in the case
of LAA is that due to LBT there is no guarantee that the channel is obtained
for scheduling the UE at the exact moment desired by the eNB. In addition,
even if CCA succeeds, the transmitter (i.e., eNB) can only be occupying the
channel for a limited time duration due to the limited maximum transmission
duration requirement. This means that the DRX timers (on-duration, inactivity
timer) should be long enough or DRX cycles should be short enough to allow
time for obtaining access to the channel.
Until further studies reveal that there is a need for very short DRX
cycles/very long Active times, common DRX is recommended to be used as the
baseline across all aggregated licensed and unlicensed serving cells.
#### 7.2.2.4 QoS control
QoS support is implemented using radio bearers in the air interface. As shown
in Figure 7.2.2.4-1 below, in current carrier aggregation, a radio bearer can
be transmitted/received on any serving cell.
Figure 7.2.2.4-1: Protocol architecture in carrier aggregation
The radio environment in unlicensed spectrum is quite different compared with
that on licensed spectrum (current LTE systems). In unlicensed spectrum, there
could be various sources for interference which are outside the control of the
operator: other RATs (e.g. WLAN) or LAA nodes of other operators etc. In the
extreme case, the resources of LAA cell(s) can be of little use due to very
strong interference and/or very low channel availability. In addition, LBT and
DTX need to be supported to meet regulatory requirements. This could impact
QoS of some bearers, e.g. latency requirements might not be satisfied, if the
characteristics of LAA cell are not fully considered when traffic mapping is
performed. Thus, the characteristics of an LAA cell should be considered when
mapping traffic from radio bearers to carrier(s).
For downlink data transmission, the eNB can decide which data of which radio
bearers is mapped to which carrier(s) (in licensed or unlicensed spectrum).
Hence, there is no impact on LTE RAN specifications.
If UE is also required to perform LBT for UL transmission, there is no
guarantee that a packet sent over an LAA cell will be received within some
time limit. Therefore, it is better not to send critical control information
(SRB) or delay-critical data or guaranteed bit rate (GBR) bearers through LAA
cells. Hence, it may be beneficial to provide UE with some rules, so that UE
would not send any data from any radio bearer on any carrier. It can be
considered, when standards are to be developed, that bearer/logical channel
and MAC Control Elements should be configured as to whether they can be
offloaded to LAA cells or whether they may only be served by licensed
carriers.
#### 7.2.2.5 RRM measurement and reporting
In Rel-12, discovery reference signals (DRS) were introduced in order to allow
a cell to alternate dynamically between On and Off states. As illustrated in
Figure 7.2.2.5-1, Rel. 12 DRS works by configuring the UE with a DMTC
(discovery measurement timing configuration) which includes subframes on which
the UE performs RRM measurements. The UE may not assume transmission of
reference signals outside of the configured subframes.
Figure 7.2.2.5-1: DRS transmission pattern for FDD
With DRS as the starting point, from an RRC protocol point of view, it is
considered feasible to perform the RRM measurement and reporting for LAA. RRM
measurements (e.g. RSRP/RSRQ) on LAA cells can be used to configure, activate,
de-configure LAA cells (as for SCells on licensed carriers). The eNB
configures the UE with a Measurement Object with a single DRS configuration
for each configured LAA SCell. It is assumed that the UE's physical layer will
only report valid RSRP/RSRQ measurement samples to RRC (i.e., L1 should not
provide samples when DRS transmission was blocked by LBT).
For the purpose of detecting hidden node in channel selection, UE reporting of
RSSI measurements to the eNB is considered useful. The eNB indicates which
carriers(s) the UE should report RSSI for. Further details of the RSSI
measurement reporting can be defined when standards are to be developed. RRM
measurement and reporting should further take into account the DRS design
options for LAA (sec 7.2.1.2).
#### 7.2.2.6 PCI confusion and PCI collision
In LAA scenarios, there may be multiple operators operating in the same
frequency channel. In case these operators do not coordinate the PCI values
for their cells, then PCI confusion and PCI collision may arise.
**PCI confusion** \-- A UE is discovering, and configuring, an LAA cell of
another operator which is having the same PCI value as a cell from its own
operator. This is illustrated in Figure 7.2.2.6-1. The blue UE, belonging to
the operator with the blue network, is identifying an LAA cell with PCI 17. If
the UE is configured to send measurements, the UE may report to the blue eNB
that it has found a cell with PCI 17. The blue eNB may then configure the blue
UE to add the cell since it knows that it has a cell with PCI 17 in this area.
But the cell which the UE has detected belongs to another operator.
{width="4.918055555555555in" height="2.10625in"}
Figure 7.2.2.6-1: Example of PCI confusion
**PCI collision** \-- A UE is in the coverage of two (or more) cells which
have the same PCI value. As illustrated in Figure 7.2.2.6-2, the blue UE,
which belongs to the operator with the blue network, is in the coverage of two
difference cells. These two cells have the same PCI: one cell belongs to the
blue operator, and the other cell belongs to the green operator.
{width="5.0375in" height="2.1569444444444446in"}
Figure 7.2.2.6-2: Example of PCI collision
If the same PCI is used for cells on the same carrier frequency in the same
area, PCI confusion or collision may occur. The number of PCIs is limited to
504. If operators do not coordinate PCIs used by their cells, the probability
of PCI confusion or collision depends on the number of LAA cells of other
operators the UE can find in the UE's PCell coverage area. That is, the risk
is higher when there is a dense deployment of LAA cells in a large PCell
coverage area. PCI collision will happen with lower probability than PCI
confusion, as PCI collision happens when the coverage areas of two cells of
the same PCI overlap at least partially.
According to the current Carrier Aggregation requirements, the UE is only
required to handle a maximum timing difference of approximately 30 µs between
the PCell and an SCell. Therefore, the UE may not be able to receive anything
from the other operators LAA cell, if the downlink of that cell arrives more
than ± 30 µs away from the UE's PCell downlink. The probability that the other
operator's LAA cell is aligned to the UE's PCell with this accuracy is 6%
assuming random timing of cells.
Furthermore, for self-scheduling, the UE will not decode downlink assignments
of the other operator's cell unless the downlink transmissions are done with a
C-RNTI matching the C-RNTI of the UE. There are 65536 C-RNTIs. If the other
operator serves 20 UEs in a cell, the probability that the same C-RNTI is used
is roughly 0.03%. Therefore, the probability that the UE can decode a downlink
message from another operator's LAA cell is 0.0018 % (0.06 * 0.0003).
If PCI confusion occurs,
a) for self-scheduling from the LAA cell: the probability that the UE will be
able to decode downlink is negligible (0.0018 % in the scenario described
above);
b) for cross-carrier scheduling from the PCell: the UE would never be able to
decode the downlink data for which the UE has received a downlink assignment,
as the data is sent in another cell. For uplink, the UE will not be able to
acquire uplink sync and would therefore not be able to transmit uplink PUSCH
in the other operator's cell. However, it may send unnecessary random access
preambles towards another operator's LAA cell (e.g., if it receives a PDCCH
order from the PCell).
It is expected that the eNB can detect PCI confusion for example by seeing
that the UE is reporting good quality for a cell but no data communication
works for this UE. The eNB can then resolve the confusion by changing the PCI
for the problem cell(s).
If PCI collision happens, i.e. where the UE simultaneously hears cells from
different operators, there is a non-negligible chance that both LAA cells
become unusable to the UEs that fall in their common coverage area. This would
result in the UE not being able to receive on downlink and transmit on uplink
in these cells. It is also expected that in some cases (i.e. not in hidden
node cases where the two cells with the same PCI are hidden from each other
but are heard by UEs), network can detect PCI collision by listening to
carriers and resolve it by changing the PCI values of their cells.
PCI confusion and PCI collision can be avoided completely if operators
coordinate the PCI values for their LAA cells. Otherwise, the probability that
they happen is scenario dependent, but it is expected that they will only
happen rarely.
To further mitigate PCI confusion, EUTRAN cells provide a unique identifier
(CGI) via system information broadcast. It was discussed whether LAA cells
should provide a similar identifier. However, it is assumed that no such
mechanism is required to address PCI confusion and PCI Collision.
#### 7.2.2.7 In-device coexistence (IDC)
In Rel-11, solutions were introduced for handling in-device coexistence
interference due to extreme proximity of multiple radio transceivers within
the same UE operating on adjacent frequencies or sub-harmonic frequencies.
LAA design should support LAA with multiple other-technology radio modems,
where it should, e.g., be possible to detect WLAN networks during LAA
operation; note that this does not imply concurrent LAA+WLAN
reception/transmission.
Current devices already support multiple RATs operating in close proximity. An
example is shown in Figure 7.2.2.7-1, where transmissions by an LTE
transmitter cause interference to a GPS receiver and a Bluetooth/WLAN
receiver, and the Bluetooth/WLAN transmitter causes interference to the LTE
receiver.
Figure 7.2.2.7-1: Self-interference in a device
When the UE identifies that there is IDC type of interference, the UE shall
first try to solve the problems internally. If this does not succeed, the UE
can indicate to the eNB that it experiences IDC problems which it cannot solve
itself. Note that how the UE detects IDC problems is left to implementation.
First, the UE indicates the frequencies that are suffering from IDC
interference. In addition, if the UE determines that the IDC problems can be
solved in a TDM-manner (i.e. by multiplexing the use of the interfering
transceivers in time) the UE can indicate a bit-map or DRX cycles to the eNB
which indicates which TTIs are affected by IDC interference.
When the eNB gets the indication, it can take action to solve the problems,
for example, by performing a handover of the UE to other frequencies, removing
the problematic cell or configuring the UE with a DRX-configuration which
would solve the problem.
The existing IDC solutions can be used to support WLAN background scanning
(e.g. by means of IDC TDM; Autonomous Denial) during LAA operation. The
existing IDC solution can also be used to indicate interference problems for
cases where the UE (intends to) uses WLAN on the same or adjacent carrier to
the unlicensed carrier. If the eNB does not enable IDC or does not honour the
IDC request, the only way for the UE to enable WiFi transmission would be
performing detach and attach procedures, and changing its capabilities to
indicate that LAA is not supported. However, from system operation point of
view, having UE perform detach and attach procedures is considered
undesirable. Hence, eNB should enable IDC indications and honour the IDC
requests.
#### 7.2.2.8 Listen-Before-Talk (LBT)
LBT for DL will not impact the MAC specification for data reception at UE. LBT
for UL data transmission will impact MAC specification.
# 8 Coexistence evaluations
## 8.1 Scenarios and methodology
In this section, scenarios and methodology for evaluating coexistence between
different networks in the unlicensed band are described. Scenarios for
coexistence evaluations include the following.
\- Indoor scenario
\- Outdoor scenario.
The indoor scenario is based on Scenario 3 in [24] with the addition of an
unlicensed band. The outdoor scenario is based on Scenario 2a in [24] with the
addition of an unlicensed band. The licensed carrier for the small cell and
macro cell are different in the outdoor scenario. Performance of UE(s)
attached to the macro layer is not evaluated. More than one carrier can be
considered for the unlicensed carrier. It should be noted that the evaluation
scenarios in this section do not restrict the design target scenario for LAA.
The evaluations scenarios are shown in Figure 8.1-1. The simulation
methodology for the single carrier outdoor scenario assumes an unmanaged Wi-Fi
network. The simulation methodology for the four carrier outdoor scenario with
random channel selection assumes an unmanaged Wi-Fi network. Note that these
scenarios do not include peer-to-peer communication in Wi-Fi networks
{width="6.24375in" height="2.067361111111111in"}
Figure 8.1-1: LAA evaluation scenarios
The coexistence cases evaluated include the following.
\- Wi-Fi-LAA coexistence
\- LAA-LAA coexistence
In the Wi-Fi-LAA coexistence case, the following evaluation methodology is
followed.
\- For each UE and eNB/AP drop
\- Step 1: Performance metrics for two Wi-Fi networks coexisting in a given
evaluation scenario are evaluated and recorded.
\- Step 2: Wi-Fi is replaced with LAA for the group of eNBs and UEs served by
one of the Wi-Fi operators. Performance metrics of the Wi-Fi network
coexisting with the LAA network are evaluated and recorded.
A comparison of the performance metrics between the two steps for the Wi-Fi
network that was not replaced with LAA can be used to evaluate coexistence
between LAA and Wi-Fi in an unlicensed band.
In the LAA-LAA coexistence case, the following evaluation methodology is
followed.
\- Performance metrics for two LAA operators coexisting in a given evaluation
scenario are evaluated and recorded.
A comparison of the performance metrics for the two LAA operators can be used
to evaluate coexistence between two LAA operators in an unlicensed band.
## 8.2 Channel access schemes
The evaluated channel access schemes can be classified into the following
categories:
_\- Category 1: No LBT_
\- No LBT procedure is performed by the transmitting entity.
_\- Category 2: LBT without random back-off_
\- The duration of time that the channel is sensed to be idle before the
transmitting entity transmits is deterministic.
_\- Category 3: LBT with random back-off with a contention window of fixed
size_
\- The LBT procedure has the following procedure as one of its components. The
transmitting entity draws a random number N within a contention window. The
size of the contention window is specified by the minimum and maximum value of
N. The size of the contention window is fixed. The random number N is used in
the LBT procedure to determine the duration of time that the channel is sensed
to be idle before the transmitting entity transmits on the channel.
_\- Category 4: LBT with random back-off with a contention window of variable
size_
\- The LBT procedure has the following as one of its components. The
transmitting entity draws a random number N within a contention window. The
size of contention window is specified by the minimum and maximum value of N.
The transmitting entity can vary the size of the contention window when
drawing the random number N. The random number N is used in the LBT procedure
to determine the duration of time that the channel is sensed to be idle before
the transmitting entity transmits on the channel.
## 8.3 Coexistence results
### 8.3.1 Coexistence evaluation results for LAA with only DL transmissions
Key findings from the most challenging scenarios in Annex B.1 are discussed in
this section. The single carrier scenario was considered as the most
challenging and stringent test for the LBT scheme and as a result many more
companies simulated the single carrier case as compared to the four carrier
case. Similarly, there was a larger focus on the indoor scenario than the
outdoor scenario. Considering the above, the findings focus more on the high
load points for the single carrier case which are expected to generate the
most contention between devices for access to the channel.
#### 8.3.1.1 DL-only LAA coexisting with Wi-Fi with only DL transmissions
##### 8.3.1.1.1 Detailed findings for indoor scenarios
Key findings from Table B.1-1 in Annex B.1 which captured the results for an
indoor deployment with one shared unlicensed carrier and FTP traffic are
summarized below.
\- Eight sources evaluated LAA with a category 2 LBT scheme. Seven companies
showed that all metrics (24 metrics across UPT, delay, 5^th^, 50^th^ and
95^th^ percentile and mean values, and low, medium and high loads) improved
for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator when the other co-existing Wi-Fi operator
was replaced by LAA. One company showed that all metrics improved except for a
degradation of less than 1% in the 95^th^ percentile UPT at low load.
\- Nineteen sources evaluated LAA with a category 3 LBT scheme without the use
of the licensed carrier, with varying LAA CCA-ED thresholds between -82 dBm
and -62 dBm.
\- Nine sources showed that all metrics improved for the non-replaced Wi-Fi
operator when the other co-existing Wi-Fi operator was replaced by LAA. One of
these sources also showed the same coexistence trend for the additional case
where RTS/CTS was enabled in the non-replaced Wi-Fi network and the LAA CCA-ED
threshold was set to -82 dBm.
\- Five sources showed an improvement in all except 3 or fewer out of the 24
measured metrics. One of these sources showed this coexistence trend for the
case where RTS/CTS was enabled in the non-replaced Wi-Fi network.
\- One source showed an improvements in 17 out of 24 metrics with the largest
degradation in UPT of less than 7% at high load.
\- One source showed that all metrics except one improved for the non-replaced
Wi-Fi operator when a TxOP of 13 ms was used, but 10 out of the 24 metrics
showed degradation when a TxOP of 4 ms was used.
\- One source showed several variations of a category 3 LBT scheme with all
except one scheme showing a degradation in a majority of the measured metrics
for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator. One LBT scheme assuming transmission and
reception of Wi-Fi preambles showed an improvement in all except one of the
measured metrics.
\- One source showed a degradation in six of the 24 measured metrics for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi network.
\- One source showed a degradation in 9 out of the 24 metrics including a
degradation of 98% in 5^th^ percentile throughput for the coexisting Wi-Fi
operator at high load when at least 20% of the offered traffic was not served
for the Wi-Fi networks.
\- Eleven sources evaluated LAA with a category 4 LBT scheme _with varying LAA
CCA-ED thresholds between -82 dBm and -62 dBm,_ and three sources evaluated
different variations of their category 4 LBT scheme.
\- Seven sources showed an improvement in all measured metrics for the non-
replaced Wi-Fi operator when the other co-existing Wi-Fi operator was replaced
by LAA.
\- One source showed an improvement in 18 out of the 24 metrics with the
largest degradation UPT being less than 3% at low load.
\- One source showed a degradation in six out of the 24 measured metrics for
the non-replaced operator with all the degraded metrics being at high load
when more than 10% of the offered traffic was not served for any of the
coexisting networks.
\- One source showed a degradation in four of the 24 measured metrics for the
non-replaced operator when a TxOP of 4 ms was used. When a TxOP of 13 ms was
used, it was shown that all the measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi
operator improved.
\- One source evaluated many variations of a category 4 LBT scheme and showed
degradation in a majority of the metrics for all of the LBT schemes evaluated.
Key findings from Table B.1-2 in Annex B.1 which captured the results for two
LAA networks coexisting in an indoor _deployment with one shared unlicensed
carrier and FTP traffic are summarized below._
\- Nine sources simulated a category 2 LBT scheme, thirteen sources simulated
a category 3 scheme, and five sources simulated a category 4 scheme, all
without the use of the licensed carrier. The majority of the evaluations
showed that the two LAA networks have similar performance.
\- Two sources evaluated both an inter-operator synchronous and an inter-
operator asynchronous configuration with a category 2 LBT scheme. Both sources
reported a degradation in performance of the two LAA networks when their LBT
sensing periods are synchronized as compared to when they are not synchronized
in terms of UPT, delay as well as the ratio of served to offered traffic.
Key findings from Table B.1-3 in Annex B.1 which captured the results for an
indoor deployment with one shared unlicensed carrier and mixed (FTP and VoIP)
traffic are summarized below.
\- One source evaluated DL-only LAA based category 1, i.e., no coexistence
mechanism implemented by the transmitting node, without the use of the
licensed carrier and showed that there was a degradation in performance in 6
out of the 27 metrics measured for the non-replaced Wi-Fi network including an
increase in VoIP outage from 0% to 45% at low loads.
\- One source evaluated DL-only LAA with a category 2 scheme and showed
improvements in all of the measured performance metrics for the coexisting Wi-
Fi operator.
\- Five sources evaluated DL-only LAA without the use of the licensed carrier
with a category 3 LBT scheme _and varying LAA CCA-ED thresholds such as -82
dBm and -62 dBm_.
\- Two sources showed at least one version of a category 3 scheme that showed
improvements in the measured performance metrics including no increase in VoIP
outage for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.
\- One source reported an improvement in 25 out of the 27 measured metrics
with an increase in VoIP outage at medium and high loads when a sensing
threshold of -62 dBm was used.
\- One source reported degradation in 6 out of the 27 measured metrics with no
increase in VoIP outage for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.
\- One source reported degradation in performance of the non-replaced Wi-Fi
operator in a majority of the measured performance metrics for all evaluated
cases including a case where explicit TxBF, closed loop MCS/rank adaptation
using explicit TXBF information, and short guard interval were used for the
Wi-Fi network.
\- One source showed results with a sensing threshold of -62 dBm and with and
without the use of explicit TxBF, closed loop MCS/rank adaptation using
explicit TXBF information, and short guard interval for the Wi-Fi network.
When these features were not used, a degradation in 19 out of the 27 measured
metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi network was observed with the 5 metrics
including the 3 VoIP outage metrics with an increase in VoIP outage from 40 to
50%. At high load. The LAA system features were kept the same in both
evaluations. When these features were used, a degradation in 24 of the 27
measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi network was observed including the
3 VoIP outage metrics which included an increase from 30% to 60% at high load.
\- Three sources evaluated DL-only LAA with various versions of category 4 LBT
schemes and varying LAA CCA-ED thresholds _such as -82 dBm and -62 dBm_. All

improvements in all the measured performance metrics along with no increase in
VoIP outage for a coexisting Wi-Fi operator. All three sources showed that
VoIP outage for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator increased when using a
threshold of -62 dBm, but that VoIP outage for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator
reduced when using a lower sensing threshold. Two sources showed no increase
in VoIP outage with a threshold of -82 dBm and one source showed no increase
in VoIP outage with a threshold of -77 dBm or -82 dBm.
\- One source showed that there was an improvement in all measured performance
metrics except for an increase in VoIP outage when a sensing threshold of -62
dBm was used including an increase from 35% to 40% at high loads. When a
sensing threshold of -82 dBm was used, there was an improvement in all
measured performance metrics without any increase in VoIP outage. This source
also showed results with the use of closed loop MIMO for Wi-Fi and short guard
interval with a sensing threshold of -82 dBm and reported an improvement in 26
out of the 27 measured metrics with a decrease of 4% in 95^th^ percentile
throughput at low loads.
\- One source evaluated a category 4 LBT scheme with different sensing
thresholds and with and without transmission/reception of Wi-Fi preambles. An
improvement in the majority of the measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi
network including VoIP outage is reported either with the use of sensing
thresholds of -77 dBm or below or with the transmission/reception of Wi-Fi
preambles. These results used explicit TxBF, closed loop MCS/rank adaptation
using explicit TXBF information, and short guard interval for the Wi-Fi
network.
\- One source showed results with a sensing threshold of -62 dBm and with and
without the use of explicit TxBF, closed loop MCS/rank adaptation using
explicit TXBF information, and short guard interval for the Wi-Fi network.
When these features were not used, a degradation in 3 of the 27 measured
metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi network was observed with the 3 metrics
being VoIP outage including an increase from 35% to 40% at high load. When
these features were used, a degradation in 5 out of the 27 measured metrics
for the non-replaced Wi-Fi network was observed with the 5 metrics including
the 3 VoIP outage metrics with an increase in VoIP outage from 11 to 38% at
low load. The LAA system features were kept the same in both evaluations.

dBm, -77 dBm, and -82 dBm were tested for the LAA network.
Based on all the evaluations for various scenarios, the following may be
observed.
**_Observation:_** A majority of sources showed at least one LBT scheme for
LAA that does not impact Wi-Fi more than another Wi-Fi network (offering the
same traffic to the same users). Within each LBT category, the LBT schemes
and/or parameters shown by different sources to not impact Wi-Fi more than
another Wi-Fi network may be different.
**_Observation:_** All sources that submitted results with a category 1 LBT
scheme, i.e., no coexistence mechanism implemented by the transmitting node,
showed that it cannot operate without impacting Wi-Fi in at least some of the
measured performance metrics.
**_Observation:_** An LAA network operating a category 2 DL LBT scheme based
on the ETSI FBE procedure can operate without impacting Wi-Fi more than an
equivalent Wi-Fi network. Further discussion may also be needed on the
coexistence performance between two LAA networks, especially for the case
where the LBT sensing periods of the two operators' networks are synchronized.
**_Observation:_** A majority of sources that evaluated an LAA network
operating a category 3 DL LBT scheme based on ETSI Option B with modifications
including at least a defer period showed that it can operate without impacting
Wi-Fi more than another Wi-Fi network.
**_Observation:_** A majority of sources that evaluated an LAA network
operating a category 4 DL LBT scheme based on ETSI Option B with modifications
including at least defer periods and variable (exponential) contention windows
showed that it can operate without impacting Wi-Fi more than an equivalent Wi-
Fi network.

performance metrics were observed for both the evaluated LBT combinations. The
performance metrics for LAA on the UL were observed to be better with the use
of the category 3 scheme on the UL.
\- Two sources enabled RTS/CTS for the Wi-Fi network in their evaluations and
both sources showed improvements in all measured performance metrics for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi network.
\- LAA sensing thresholds of -62 dBm and -82 dBm were used in the evaluations
from the various sources.
\- Two sources used a sensing threshold of -82 dBm for LAA and both sources
reported an improvement in all measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi
operator.
\- One source used a sensing threshold of -82 dBm for the LAA DL and -62 dBm
for the LAA UL and reported in improvement in 22 out of the 24 measured
metrics with a degradation of less than 10% in the remaining metrics.
\- Four sources used a sensing threshold of -62 dBm for DL and UL for LAA.
Three sources reported an improvement in all measured metrics for the non-
replaced Wi-Fi network. One source reported improvements in all 24 performance
metrics for a 50/50 DL/UL traffic split, whereas for a 80/20 DL/UL traffic
split, degradations for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator were reported in 3 out
of the 24 metrics for the DL and in 17 of the 24 metrics for the UL with
degradations of up to 23% on the DL and 63% on the UL at high loads when more
than 50% of the UL traffic was not served in the LAA network.
One source showed results in Table B.3-2 in Annex B.3 for an indoor
_deployment with one shared unlicensed carrier and mixed (FTP and VoIP)
traffic, with evaluations of various combinations of category 4 LBT schemes on
the DL and LBT schemes based on all possible categories for the UL, in
addition to evaluations of category 3 LBT schemes on both the DL and UL based
on ETSI Option B with the addition of defer periods and mandatory ECCA. The
category 4 LBT schemes were based on the Wi-Fi medium access protocol. The
evaluated UL LBT schemes included self-scheduling and shortened contention
windows for faster UL channel access. For all evaluated combinations of LBT
schemes, improvements in all measured performance metrics (33 metrics across
UPT, delay, 5th, 50th and 95th percentile and mean values, and low, medium and
high loads, VoIP outage percentages) were observed for the non-replaced Wi-Fi
network. A sensing threshold of -82 dBm was used for LAA._
One source showed results in Table B.3-4 in Annex B.3 for an outdoor
_deployment with a single shared unlicensed carrier and FTP traffic with
category 3 LBT schemes on both the DL and UL. Improvements in all the measured
performance metrics were observed for the non-replaced Wi-Fi network. RTS/CTS
was enabled for the Wi-Fi network. RTS/CTS was enabled for the Wi-Fi network
in the evaluation. A sensing threshold of -82 dBm was used for LAA._
Two sources evaluated the coexistence of two LAA operators for an indoor
deployment with a single shared unlicensed carrier and FTP traffic (Table
B.3-3 in Annex B.3)
\- One source evaluated two LAA operators coexisting with various combinations
of category 4 LBT schemes on the DL and LBT schemes based on categories 2, 3
and 4 for the UL as well as a combination with a category 3 LBT scheme for
both the DL and the UL. The category 4 LBT schemes were based on the Wi-Fi
medium access protocol. The evaluated UL LBT schemes included self-scheduling
and shortened contention windows for faster UL channel access. For all
evaluated combinations of LBT schemes, all the measured performance metrics
were similar for both operators indicating good coexistence.
\- One source evaluated a category 4 LBT scheme on the DL and a category 2 LBT
scheme on the UL, and observed the majority of the performance metrics to be
similar for both operators.
One source provided results for the single carrier indoor scenario (Table
B.3-5 in Annex B.3) and single carrier outdoor scenario (Table B.3-6 in Annex
B.3) and FTP traffic with the number of UEs per operator per carrier increased
from 20 to 50. An improvement in all measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-
Fi operator was reported for both the indoor and outdoor scenarios.
#### 8.3.2.2 General observations on LBT schemes
Many LBT schemes were evaluated by the contributing sources across all the
scenarios for the DL and the UL. The schemes evaluated can be summarized as
follows. Schemes were tested for both DL and UL unless otherwise stated.
\- Category 1 scheme: Use of no LBT on the UL when an LBT scheme is used on
the DL was evaluated by one source.
\- Category 2 schemes: The sources evaluating category 2 schemes all used an
ETSI FBE scheme. Category 2 schemes were only used for the UL.
\- Category 3 schemes: The variations of category 3 schemes that were
evaluated are summarized below
\- ETSI Option B with no changes to any of the parameters
\- ETSI Option B with an additional defer period and mandatory initial and
extended CCA
\- ETSI Option B with an additional defer period and a small contention window
for fast UL LBT (used only for UL)
\- A category 3 scheme with a single sensing interval of 34 microseconds which
may be applied after a random backoff within a 100 microsecond window and use
of a restricted CCA window
\- Category 4 schemes: The evaluated schemes in this category may be
summarized as follows
\- An LBT scheme based on the category 4 framework in the working assumption
with slot size, contention windows and exponential backoff similar to Wi-Fi
and trigger mechanism for contention window increases based on the most recent
ACK/NACK.
\- An LBT scheme based on the category 4 framework in the working assumption
with slot size and exponential backoff similar to Wi-Fi, a small contention
window for fast UL LBT (used only for UL) and trigger mechanism for contention
window increases based on the most recent ACK/NACK.
\- An LBT scheme based on the category 4 framework in the working assumption
with slot size, contention windows and exponential backoff similar to Wi-Fi
and trigger mechanism for contention window increases based on a majority of
the ACK/NACKs in the latest DL burst. This was used only for the DL.
Based on all the evaluations for various scenarios, the following may be
observed.
**_Observation:_** A majority of sources showed combinations of LAA DL and UL
LBT schemes that do not impact Wi-Fi more than another Wi-Fi network (offering
the same traffic to the same users) in any of the measured performance
metrics. Category 3 and 4 were tested for the DL and Categories 1 through 4
were tested for the UL. Within each LBT category, the LBT schemes and/or
parameters shown by different sources to not impact Wi-Fi more than another
Wi-Fi network may be different.
### 8.3.3 Adjacent channel interference analysis for Wi-Fi-LAA scenario
##### 8.3.3.1 Overview of evaluation methodology
The aim of this section is to evaluate the impact of Adjacent Channel
Interference (ACI) on system performance. Therefore, we will consider a
generic scenario in which the aggressor system and the victim system use
adjacent channels. 3GPP has a consolidated procedure to evaluate the impact of
ACI. This methodology is based on modelling Adjacent Channel Interference
Ratio (ACIR) as described in [27].
In this section, we first give a detailed description of ACIR modelling and
then adapt the simulation methodology specified in [27] to a scenario in which
the victim and aggressor system have different RF characteristics. It is worth
noticing that from an ACI point of view, a system with better RF performance
will create lower interference. As a consequence when looking at the impact of
LAA to Wi-Fi compared to the Wi-Fi + Wi-Fi scenario, a direct conclusion can
be drawn based on the RF specifications which determine the ACIR value.
##### 8.3.3.2 ACIR modelling
**ACIR can be expressed as a function of Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR)
and Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) [27]:**
$\text{ACIR} \approx \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\text{ACLR}} + \frac{1}{\text{ACS}}}$
(8.4.2-1)
**It is worth noticing that ACLR and ACS values are not defined in the IEEE
specification [25].** However, a spectrum emission mask is defined for each
transmission bandwidth. Figure 8.4.2.1-1 shows the spectrum mask defined for
the 20 MHz case. Since the emission mask is expressed in dBr, i.e. the
provided values are relative to the in-band PSD, ACLR that **Wi-Fi** should
satisfy in 5GHz **can be simply obtained by integrating the mask in the first
frequency region charactering the first ACLR [25]. This integration process
leads to a value of about 26.3dBc.**

Figure 8.4.2-1: 802.11 transmit spectrum mask for 20MHz
Regarding ACS, the IEEE specification does not include a parameter consistent
with ACS definition. However, Adjacent Channel Rejection (ACR) is included as
part of the receiver requirements [25]. ACR is defined as a function of the
adopted MCS as reported in table 8.4.2-1.
Table 8.4.2-1: Adjacent Channel Rejection and Sensitivity from [25].
* * *
Modulation Coding Rate Adjacent Channel Rejection (dB) Sensitivity (dBm) for
20MHz channels BPSK 1/2 16 --82 QPSK 1/2 13 --79 QPSK 3/4 11 --77 16-QAM 1/2 8
--74 16-QAM 3/4 4 --70 64-QAM 2/3 0 --66 64-QAM 3/4 -1 --65 64-QAM 5/6 -2 --64
* * *
By taking into account the SNR and Implementation Margin (IM), a value
equivalent to the ACS value defined in 3GPP could be derived. However, it is
worth noticing that the definition of aggressor system is not the same when
considering the 3GPP and the IEEE specification. Many contributions have been
submitted to RAN4 to derive a minimum ACS requirement for Wi-Fi based on Table
8.4.2-1. In this section, in order to capture the differences related to the
different definitions, we will consider an ACS range to model Wi-Fi. Using a
range from 22dB to 29dB we will be able to cover extreme cases in which Wi-Fi
has very poor performance or better performance compared to LAA UEs.
Based on the above observations, table 8.4.2-2 summarizes the ACIR values used
to model both Wi-Fi and LAA.
Table 8.4.2-2: ACIR values when Wi-Fi is the victim system.
* * *
Study Case Wi-Fi ACS (dB) Aggressor ACLR (dBc) ACIR (dB) LAA node to Wi-Fi
AP/STAs 22 45 21.98 25 24.96 29 28.89 LAA UE to Wi-Fi AP/STAs 22 30 21.36 25
23.81 29 26.46 Wifi AP/STAs to Wi-Fi AP/STAs 22 26.35 20.64 25 22.61 29 24.47
* * *
**The table summarizes all the possible cases of interference when Wi-Fi
AP/STA is a victim and when one of the following is the aggressor**
\- LAA BS
\- LAA UE
\- Another WI-Fi AP/STA
**As it can be observed, for the same ACS value, when LAA is the aggressor
ACIR value is larger compared to the case when Wi-Fi is the aggressor. This is
simply due to the better ACLR available for LAA. In particular, as far as LAA
UEs and BSs have better ACLR compared to Wi-Fi STAs/APs the amount of
interference leakage into the adjacent victim channel created by LAA nodes
will be lower to a victim Wi-Fi AP/STA compared to the one created by Wi-Fi
APs and STAs.**
**In summary, because of the better LAA RF performance, when looking at impact
of LAA on Wi-Fi, we can conclude that the amount of adjacent channel
interference created by LAA UEs and BSs will be lower compared to the one
created by Wi-Fi APs and STAs.**
**In the next section, we will consolidate the above observation by taking
into account an evaluation methodology based on [27].**
#### 8.3.3.3 Simulation methodology for adjacent channel co-existence
In this section, scenarios and methodology for evaluating adjacent channel
coexistence between different networks in the unlicensed band are described.
The methodology is based on [27] and adapted to take into account a layout in
which the aggressor and victim systems have different RF characteristics.
The following scenarios for adjacent channel coexistence are taken into
account:
\- Indoor scenario
\- Outdoor scenario.
Both of the scenarios could be reused from chapter 8.1. For adjacent channel
interference analysis, only the unlicensed band needs to be considered.
The coexistence cases for adjacent channel evaluations that have been studied
are as follows:
\- Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi, which could be the baseline to evaluate the LAA to Wi-Fi
case.
\- Wi-Fi to LAA
\- LAA to Wi-Fi
#### 8.3.3.4 Adjacent channel coexistence simulation results
There are quite a few results provided in [28-34]. In this section, the
simulation results are shown considering both static and dynamic simulations.
##### 8.3.3.4.1 Static simulation

Figure 8.3.3.4.1-1: Rx power distributions of Wi-Fi when LAA and WiFi
neighbouring in indoor scenario [28]
In Figure 8.4.4.1-1, the received power distributions at Wi-Fi are plotted
considering a Wi-Fi DL/UL split of 50%/50%.The plots show useful received
power and co-channel interference (black curves), as well as adjacent channel
interference considering both Wi-Fi + Wi-Fi and LAA + Wi-Fi (red and green
curves) deployments in indoor scenario. More details are found in [28].

In Figure 8.3.3.4.1-2, the interfering node is randomly chosen, excluding the
neighbouring node of the interfering network The plots show adjacent channel
interference considering both Wi-Fi + Wi-Fi and LAA + Wi-Fi deployments in the
indoor scenario. More details are found in [29].
{width="4.409722222222222in" height="3.48125in"}
Figure 8.3.3.4.1-3: Rx power distributions in outdoor scenario [30]
In Figure 8.3.3.4.1-3, the received power distributions at Wi-Fi are plotted
considering a Wi-Fi DL/UL split of 50%/50%. The plots show adjacent channel
interference considering both Wi-Fi + Wi-Fi and LAA + Wi-Fi deployments in the
outdoor scenario. More details are found in [30].
As it can be observed, in all the scenarios taken into account the amount of
ACI generated by LAA is lower compared to the one created by Wi-Fi. This is
consistent with observations made in section 8.3.3.2.
##### 8.3.3.4.2 Dynamic simulation
{width="3.3006944444444444in" height="2.1347222222222224in"}{width="3.3375in"

Figure 8.3.3.4.2-1: Adjacent channel interference of LAA to WLAN for LAA LBE
and FBE [31]
The ACI simulations results show the ACI caused by LAA to Wi-Fi and ACI caused
by another WLAN with different packet arrival rates for both LAA LBE and FBE
modes. More details are found in [31].
From figure 8.3.3.4.2-1, observations made in section 8.3.3.2 and 8.3.3.4.1
are confirmed, i.e., ACI from LAA to Wi-Fi is lower compared to intra Wi-Fi
ACI.
#### 8.3.3.5 Conclusions
Based on the simulation results provided in 8.3.3.4, it can be concluded that
LAA and Wi-Fi can coexist in adjacent channels. According to the simulation
results, LAA causes less adjacent channel interference to a Wi-Fi system
compared to another Wi-Fi system. In other words, LAA is a better neighbour
than another WiFi system in terms of adjacent channel coexistence with a Wi-Fi
system.
### 8.3.4 Adjacent channel interference analysis for LAA-LAA to scenario
Depending on LAA deployment mode, different coexistence cases should be taken
into account. A summary of the possible coexistence scenarios is summarized in
Table 8.3.4-1.
Table 8.3.4-1: Adjacent channel interference scenarios for the LAA aggressor
and LAA victim.

BS UE ACLR, BS ACS DL to DL LAA BS LAA UE BS ACLR, UE ACS UL to DL LAA UE LAA
UE UE ACLR, UE ACS DL to UL LAA BS LAA BS BS ACLR, BS ACS
* * *
One of the main goals of LAA-LAA coexistence studies is to investigate what
are the proper requirements to ensure performance to a target level.
As a general observation, it is worth noticing that in a generic case LAA
performance is affected by adjacent interference coming from other LAA nodes
and from nodes operating in the same 5GHz band belonging to other technologies
and with different ACLR requirements. Therefore, when looking at LAA
performance it is worth considering that it is not possible to guarantee that
ACI will always be low enough, due to the contribution from other technologies
implementing a different ACLR. Thus, when looking at LAA performance in 5GHz
unlicensed band, a low perceived adjacent channel interference cannot be
guaranteed in case other technologies than LAA are transmitting in the same
area.
#### 8.3.4.1 Simulation methodology
Simulation methodology is similar to LAA to Wi-Fi simulations that have been
discussed earlier in Section 8.3.3.
#### 8.3.4.2 Simulation results
##### 8.3.4.2.1 LAA-LAA coexistence with Rel-8 legacy requirements
In the first step, investigation of the impact on the performance with legacy
parameters is performed. Legacy LTE ACLR and ACS model are adopted. Average
and edge throughput losses are shown in table 8.3.4.2.1-1 [44].
Table 8.3.4.2.1-1: Throughput loss for case 1 and case 2
* * *
Case Victim ACS [dB] Aggressor ACLR [dB] Throughput loss(%)  
Average Edge LAA DL to LAA DL 27 45 1.17% 1.0% LAA UL to LAA UL 46 30 0.4%
0.01%
* * *
By the threshold of 5% throughput loss, it is observed LAA and LAA can coexist
when legacy parameters are considered. This is in line with contributions
provided by many companies in RAN4, showing a marginal amount of adjacent
channel interference when legacy parameters are taken into account.
In the following sections, sensitivity analyses of some of the RF parameters
are performed for two different scenarios.
##### 8.3.4.2.2 DL-to-DL performance in LAA-LAA scenario
In order to evaluate a wide range of interference scenarios, we take into
account three possible configurations in terms of number of simultaneously
active nodes, namely configuration A, B, and C:
\- Configurations A: 8 nodes are active (4 nodes per operator).
\- Configurations B: 4 nodes are active (2 nodes per operator).
\- Configurations C: 2 nodes are active (1 nodes per operator).
In the Figure 8.3.4.2.2-1 and 8.3.4.2.2-2 show the received powers and SINR
distributions at UE side considering configuration A. As it can be observed
from the SINR CDF the impact of a reduced ACLR at BS is very marginal. It is
worth noticing that this configuration represents a highly loaded scenario in
which nodes close to each other transmit in the same channel. In this
particular case SINR will be dominated by CCI and the impact of ACI will be
negligible. It can be observed that scenarios B and C are more accurate in
representing what could be a realistic operation. The numbers of active nodes
for a given deployment will be determined based on the access mechanism
defined by RAN1 (including CCA threshold and LBT mechanism). However, as
already mentioned, the three configurations analyzed gives us the flexibility
to infer about LAA to LAA ACI coexistence performance in a wide range of
network conditions [45].

channel interference (CCI) and adjacent channel interference (ACI) are shown.

Figure 8.3.4.2.2-2: SINR distributions at UEs for configuration A: all nodes
from LAA operator A and B are active.
##### 8.3.4.2.3 UL-to-UL performance evaluations in LAA-LAA scenario
Regarding UL-to-UL performance, the source of adjacent channel interference is
another UE operating in adjacent channel. In this particular case, the
performance results in terms of SINR degradation due to adjacent channel
interference is expected to be in line with what is observed in DL-to-DL case
in the previous section. Keeping this in mind, proper selectivity requirements
for LAA BS need to be investigated in WI phase.
##### 8.3.4.2.4 DL-to-UL performance evaluations
**The ACIR values that are used in this section for LAA to LAA coexistence
evaluations are shown in table** 8.3.4.2.4-1 **[44].**

* * *
One of the considerations in the scenario is the power control at the UE.
Regarding power control of LAA UL, power control sets are assumed as shown in
table 8.3.4.2.4-2. Where, PC set 1 is original power of LTE UL in pico cell.
New parameters are tried in other PC sets to boost UL power to improve UL
performance. Because from figure 8.3.4.2.2-1, there is nearly 30dB margin of
interference produced by LAA UL compare to Wi-Fi.

Figure 8.3.4.2.4-1 shows the throughput loss for case of LAA DL to LAA UL with
different power control sets shown in table 8.3.4.2.4-2.

Figure 8.3.4.2.4-1:Throughput loss for case of LAA DL to LAA UL
From this figure, it is observed that throughput loss is relevant to ACLR,
i.e. to meet 5% throughput loss threshold, ACLR should be no less than certain
value.
However, from these preliminary results, the coexistence of LAA DL to LAA UL
is possible, provided that suitable power control parameters and RF
requirements are defined.
##### 8.3.4.2.5 Transmission opportunity at LAA network 1
For three different RF requirement combination and two different traffic
combinations from interfering network, we present the ACI curves in Figure
8.3.4.2.4-1 seen at the LAA nodes for following 6 cases [46]:
Table 8.3.4.2.5-1: Studied cases
+--------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+------------+------------+ | | LAA2 Node | LAA1 Node | LAA1 Node \ | LAA2 Node\ | LAA1 Node\ | | | | | | DL/UL(%) | DL/UL(%) | | | | | LAA2 Node | | | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+------------+------------+ | | ACLR | ACS | ACIR | | | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+------------+------------+ | Case-1 | 45 | 45 | 42.0 | 100/0 | 100/0 | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+------------+------------+ | Case-2 | 36 | 27 | 26.5 | 100/0 | 100/0 | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+------------+------------+ | Case-3 | 26 | 22 | 20.5 | 100/0 | 100/0 | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+------------+------------+ | Case-4 | 45 | 45 | 42.0 | 50/50 | 100/0 | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+------------+------------+ | Case-5 | 36 | 27 | 26.5 | 50/50 | 100/0 | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+------------+------------+ | Case-6 | 26 | 22 | 20.5 | 50/50 | 100/0 | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+------------+------------+
In all the simulations, 18dBm transmit power is assumed for all nodes and UEs.
This is valid for both operators. When only one node is active in both
operator 1 and 2 networks, then only interference seen at the network 1 node
is adjacent channel interference. For the above mentioned 6 cases, we show the
ACI curves seen at the nodes of LAA operator caused by operator 2. As
mentioned in the table, we use three different ACLR and ACS combinations for
these simulations.
It can be observed from Figure 8.3.4.2.5-1 that when ACLR is considered as the
LTE UE (i.e. 36dB as in pink curve), then almost for all cases, the
accumulative interference is below -62dBm/20MHz. When ACLR similar to Wi-Fi
systems are considered, then only for a small portion of the cases, the CCA
threshold (considered as -62dBm/20MHz in this case) is crossed.
When the aggressor network has traffic such that a node is either in UL or in
DL with 50% probability, then in general the ACI statistics become better. The
same conclusion as above is true in this case also.

#### 8.3.4.3 Conclusions from LAA-LAA evaluations
Coexistence analysises have been carried out for the LAA to LAA coexistence
scenarios by taking into account different network conditions. Simulations
presented in this document showed that:
\- Legacy RF requirements guarantee LAA to LAA ACI coexistence.
\- From ACI point of view, ACLR values lower than legacy requirement cause a
limited impact in SINR performance (and hence to throughput performance since
SINR and throughput are linearly related) in the scenario of DL to DL.
\- From throughput loss point of view ACLR values should be larger than
certain value to ensure coexistence for LAA to LAA in the scenario of DL to
UL.
Finally, we observed that since LAA and Wi-Fi are supposed to co-exist in 5GHz
spectrum, any possible modification of existing LTE RF requirements should
take into account also Wi-Fi RF requirements.
# 9 Conclusions
This technical report presents the results of a study on the operation of LTE
in unlicensed spectrum as a secondary cell. The modifications to LTE needed to
allow it to operate in unlicensed spectrum as a Secondary cell through carrier
aggregation are documented. The relevant regulatory requirements have been
summarized in section 4. It has further been identified that the use of LTE in
unlicensed spectrum can serve as a useful additional tool by operators to
maximize the value they can provide to users, while the core of the activity
of the operators remains anchored to the licensed spectrum.
Design targets and deployment scenarios have been identified that serve as a
basis to study co-existence between LAA (Licensed Assisted Access) and Wi-Fi
in unlicensed spectrum.
The coexistence evaluations performed during the study item are documented in
section 8.3. The channel access schemes (defined in Section 8.2) that were
evaluated for LAA with Downlink-only transmissions and for LAA with downlink
and uplink transmissions are listed in Section 8.3.1.4 and Section 8.3.2.2. A
majority of sources providing evaluation results showed at least one LBT
scheme for LAA that does not impact Wi-Fi more than another Wi-Fi network. The
LBT scheme and/or parameters shown by different sources to not impact Wi-Fi
more than another Wi-Fi network may be different. The studies show that when
an appropriate channel access scheme, as defined in Section 8.2, is used, it
is feasible for LAA to achieve fair coexistence with Wi-Fi, and for LAA to
coexist with itself based on the evaluated scenarios. A study of the major
aspects of LTE radio interface architecture, protocol termination, radio
interface protocols between UEs and RAN and RRM strategies to support Licensed
Assisted Access to unlicensed spectrum was conducted and it was determined
that it is feasible to support these aspects for LAA downlink and uplink
operations.
Based on the evaluations and findings in Section 8, it is recommended that the
channel access framework defined in section 7.2.1.6 be adopted for LAA. The
channel access framework includes a category 4 LBT scheme including random
backoff and variable contention windows at least for the downlink data
transmissions. It is recommended that the key parameters of the LBT scheme
such as contention windows and defer periods should be configurable within
limits to enable fair coexistence with other technologies operating in
unlicensed spectrum. It is recommended that LAA supports uplink LBT at the UE.
In LAA systems, where the UE's uplink transmissions are controlled by the eNB,
the uplink channel access scheme can be different from the downlink channel
access scheme for an LAA SCell.
The study concluded that UE reporting of RSSI measurements to the eNB is
considered useful for the purpose of detecting hidden node in the channel
selection.
Based on the studies documented in Section 8.3.2.2, 5 GHz unlicensed LAA
band(s) will be defined within frequency limits 5150 -- 5925 MHz. It is
recommended that radio requirements should be specified such that a single
filter implementation for UE across the entire frequency range from 5150 to
5925 MHz is possible.
Based on the studies documented in 8.4, it can be concluded that LAA and Wi-Fi
can coexist in adjacent channels. The study shows that LAA causes less
adjacent channel interference to a Wi-Fi system compared to another Wi-Fi
system.
The study concluded that existing IDC (In-Device Coexistence) solutions can be
used to support WLAN background scanning (e.g. by means of IDC TDM; Autonomous
Denial) during LAA operation and that the eNB should enable IDC indications
and honour the IDC requests.
A large set of design targets, physical design options and LTE RAN protocol
modifications have been studied and the conclusions and recommendations are
captured in section 7.1 and 7.2.
The impact of DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) on operating LTE in unlicensed
spectrum has been assessed and it has been concluded that DFS support does not
need new specification.
It is feasible for UEs and BSs to operate in the 5GHz unlicensed spectrum.
Suitable RF requirements should be specified taking into account issues
including implementation complexity and performance.

NOTE 1: For DL+UL coexistence evaluations, LAA UL transmission is eNB
scheduling based\ \- Only scheduled UEs contend for the channel for UL
transmission\ \- At least the case where UE performs LBT before UL
transmission should be evaluated
NOTE 2: For DL+UL coexistence evaluations, companies shall indicate the
assumptions made regarding the following parameters:\ \- Assumption on DL/UL
multiplexing of the unlicensed carrier\ \- Scheduling assumptions to satisfy
the bandwidth occupancy rule per UE\ \- Satisfying transmit PSD constraint on
the UL at the UE\ \- UL HARQ and retransmission model\ \- Modeling of control
channel\ \- Company can provide additional delay related to buffer status
report if modelled
NOTE 3: Details about the variation (if used) of CCA threshold used by the eNB
and UE (if the UE performs LBT) in relation to maximum transmission power
(e.i.r.p.) should be reported. The following should be reported as
applicable.\ \- Fixed or variable CCA threshold\ \- Rate of adaptation of the
CCA threshold
### A.2.3 Details of average buffer occupancy (BO) reporting
\- Packet arrival rate for the measured BO of the non-replaced Wi-Fi network
in Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi coexistence scenario is used as the packet arrival rate in Wi-
Fi/LAA coexistence evaluations
\- For DL-only coexistence evaluations:
\- Buffer occupancy of the i-th small cell/UE (Wi-Fi & LAA) = sum of the
period of time during which the i-th small cell/UE has data to transmit
including retransmissions (i.e., its queue is not empty) / total simulation
time
\- Average buffer occupancy of the i-th small cell/UE (Wi-Fi & LAA) = sum of
the period of time during which the i-th small cell/UE has data to transmit
including retransmissions (i.e., its queue is not empty) / total simulation
time
\- For DL+UL coexistence evaluations
\- The following metric for DL+UL should be reported:
\- Buffer occupancy of the i-th small cell (Wi-Fi & LAA) = sum of the period
of time during which at least one of the i-th small cell and UEs (belonging to
the i-th small cell) has data to transmit including retransmissions (i.e., its
queue is not empty) / total simulation time
\- Average buffer occupancy: buffer occupancy averaged over the all small
cells of the same operator
\- Recommend to report BO both for LAA and Wi-Fi
