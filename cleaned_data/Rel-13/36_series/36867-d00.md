# 4 Introduction
## 4.1 Study item objective
The general objective from [3] is to identify the scope and objectives of the
potential WI on UE requirements for 4 Rx AP:
The main objectives are as follows:
\- Identify the scope and objectives of UE RF requirements for 4 Rx AP
\- Identify the scope and objectives of RRM core requirements for 4 Rx AP
\- Identify the scope and objectives of RRM performance requirements for 4 Rx
AP
\- Identify the scope and objectives of UE performance requirements for 4 Rx
AP:
\- UE demodulation requirements and
\- CSI requirements
# 5 Objective of Core part WI
## 5.1 RF core requirement with 4 Rx AP
### 5.1.1 Scope for non-CA operation
1) No changes anticipated for RF Tx requirements
2) All RF Rx requirements are in the scope of the work item:
a) specification of requirements in sub-clauses 7.1-7.10 of 36.101 applicable
to 4Rx
3) For each band the RF requirements are verified according to the number of
Rx ports supported by the UE
### 5.1.2 Objectives for test coverage
2 Rx performance needs to be guaranteed if the 4 Rx operates with 2 Rx chains.
2 Rx test in addition to 4 Rx needs to be considered during the work item
phase, if 2 Rx operations would not meet 2 Rx requirements when 4 Rx
requirements are met.
### 5.1.3 Scope for CA operation
Specify 4 Rx RF requirements for CA after the non-CA requirements have been
completed. The non-CA should be agreed and included in TS 36.101.
## 5.2 RRM core requirement with 4 Rx AP
\
# 6 Objective of Performance part WI
## 6.1 General
Define proper antenna configuration, MIMO channel correlation matrices,
propagation channel condition for 4 Rx AP based MIMO in order to support UE
performance and CSI requirement
## 6.2 RRM performance requirement with 4 Rx AP
\
## 6.3 UE performance requirement with 4 Rx AP
### 6.3.1 Demodulation of PDSCH
\- Specify UE performance requirements with 4 Rx antenna including
\- Demodulation of PDSCH (Cell-Specific Reference Symbols)
\- Demodulation of PDSCH (User-Specific Reference Symbols)
\- PDSCH demodulation requirements support up to 4 layers
\- No prioritization on number of layers.
\- MMSE-MRC/IRC, RML and CWIC receivers will be investigated as candidate
reference receivers.
### 6.3.2 Demodulation of Control Channels
\- Study feasibility of control channels demodulation with 4 Rx antenna with
respect to:
\- Impact on UE power performance
\- System benefit
\- UE behavior in network
\- The outcome of the feasibility study is decision on whether control channel
demodulation performance needs to be specified and which control channel needs
to be specified.
\- Specify control channels demodulation performance based on the outcome of
the above feasibility of using 4 Rx for control channels.
## 6.4 CSI requirement for 4 Rx AP
\- WI scope includes CSI requirements for 4 Rx antenna including
\- CQI
\- PMI
\- RI
\- CSI requirements support up to 4 layers.
\- No prioritization on number of layers.
\- MMSE-MRC/IRC, RML and CWIC receivers will be investigated as candidate
reference receivers.
