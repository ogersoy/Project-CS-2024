# 4 General
## 4.1 Introduction
The objective is to describe the LWAAP architecture and the LWAAP entities
from a functional point of view.
## 4.2 LWAAP architecture
### 4.2.1 LWAAP entities
The description in this sub clause is a model and does not specify or restrict
implementations.
RRC is generally in control of the LWAAP configuration.
Functions of the LWAAP sublayer are performed by LWAAP entities. For an LWAAP
entity configured at the eNB, there is a peer LWAAP entity configured at the
UE and vice versa. For all LWA bearers, there is one LWAAP entity in the eNB
and one LWAAP entity in the UE.
An LWAAP entity receives/delivers LWAAP SDUs from/to upper layers (i.e. PDCP)
and sends/receives LWAAP PDUs to/from its peer LWAAP entity via WLAN:
\- At the eNB, when an LWAAP entity receives an LWAAP SDU from upper layers,
it constructs the corresponding LWAAP PDU and delivers it to lower layers;
\- At the UE, when an LWAAP entity receives an LWAAP PDU from lower layers, it
reassembles the corresponding LWAAP SDU and delivers it to upper layers.
Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the overview model of the LWAAP sublayer.
Figure 4.2.1-1: Overview model of the LWAAP sublayer
An LWAAP entity delivers/receives the following LWAAP PDU to/from a lower
layer entity:
\- LWAAP data PDU.
## 4.3 Services
### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers
The following services are provided by LWAAP to upper layers (i.e. PDCP):
\- transfer of user plane data;
### 4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers
The following services are expected by LWAAP from lower layers:
\- transfer of user plane data;
## 4.4 Functions
The following functions are supported by the LWAAP sublayer:
\- transfer of user plane data;
\- identification of the LWA bearer to which the LWAAP SDU belongs;
\- enabling or disabling data handling for LWA bearer.
# 5 Procedures
## 5.1 Data transfer procedures
### **5.1.1 DL data transfer procedures**
**When receiving an LWAAP data PDU from lower layers, the LWAAP entity in the
UE shall:**
\- identify the upper layer entity to which the LWAAP SDU is destined based on
the DRB ID included in the LWAAP header;
\- if the DRB ID belongs to LWA bearer for which DL data transfer procedures
are enabled:
\- reassemble the LWAAP SDU from the LWAAP data PDU by removing the LWAAP
header from the LWAAP data PDU;
\- deliver the reassembled LWAAP SDU to the upper layer entity identified by
the DRB ID.
\- else:
\- discard the LWAAP data PDU.
## 5.2 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
When an LWAAP entity receives an LWAAP PDU that contains reserved or invalid
values, the LWAAP entity shall:
\- discard the received PDU.
# 6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters
## 6.1 Protocol data units
### 6.1.1 General
An LWAAP PDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length. In the figures in subclause 6.1, bit strings are represented by tables
in which the most significant bit is the leftmost bit of the first line of the
table, the least significant bit is the rightmost bit on the last line of the
table, and more generally the bit string is to be read from left to right and
then in the reading order of the lines. The bit order of each parameter field
within an LWAAP PDU is represented with the first and most significant bit in
the leftmost bit and the last and least significant bit in the rightmost bit.
An LWAAP SDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length. An LWAAP SDU is included into an LWAAP PDU from the first bit onward.
The LWAAP entity shall ignore the value of Reserved bits in downlink LWAAP
PDUs.
Only one type of LWAAP PDU is defined, i.e. LWAAP data PDU.
### 6.1.2 LWAAP data PDU
An LWAAP PDU consists of an LWAAP header and a Data field, as described in
Figure 6.1.2-1.
An LWAAP header is one byte, and consists of the four header fields
R/R/R/DRBID.
A Data field is of variable size, and consists of an LWAAP SDU.
Figure 6.1.2-1: LWAAP data PDU
## 6.2 Formats and parameters
### 6.2.1 LWAAP header
The LWAAP header consists of the following fields:
\- R: Reserved bit, set to \"0\". The R field size is 1 bit;
\- DRBID: The Data Radio Bearer ID field indicates the RRC configured DRB
identity to which the corresponding LWAAP SDU belongs. The DRBID field size is
5 bits.
