# 4 Background
In the United States, the FCC has established rules for paired FDD operations
of 1755--1780 MHz band with the 2155--2180 MHz band and for the unpaired
uplink operation of 1695-1710MHz band in Report and Order (FCC 14-31) for the
licensed AWS-3 band.
The frequency ranges of AWS-3 band are as follows (see Figure 4.1 below):
• Unpaired Uplink: 1695-1710MHz
• Paired: Uplink: 1755-1780MHz and Downlink :2155-2180MHz
{width="6.227083333333334in" height="1.0722222222222222in"}
Figure 4-1: United States AWS Spectrum Blocks Arrangement
The AWS-3 blocks are scheduled to be auctioned November 2014 in the US. The
AWS-3 paired blocks (1755-1780/2150-2180 MHz) have been divided into three 2x5
blocks and one 2x10 block as shown in Table 4-1. The AWS-3 unpaired uplink
block (1695 - 1710 MHz) has been divided into one 10 MHz block and one 5 MHz
block as shown in Table 4-1. The requirements for operation in this band are
included in Part 27 of the FCC rules.

Additionally, the FCC outlines interoperability mandates and guidelines that
should be considered in defining the band plan and they are outlined in [4]."
There are existing government incumbent services within this band. Most of the
Federal government systems currently operating in the range 1755 \- 1780 MHz
are expected to be relocated and cleared over a 10 year period, but there is a
portion that will remain. The 1695 - 1710 MHz frequency range requires
coordination with 27 existing government stations. The coordination details
for both portions of the AWS-3 spectrum are not entirely defined yet and are
out-of-scope of this study item.
In Canada, Industry Canada has announced its intention to auction 1755 - 1780
/ 2155 - 2180 MHz in April 2015. Currently, one significant difference is that
the unpaired uplink portion of AWS-3 (1695-1710 MHz) is not part of the
Canadian auction. The process and decisions in Canada are not finalized yet.
CITEL has also specified a recommendation regarding the use of the use of the
spectrum 1710-1780/2110-2180MHz. CITEL recommends _"That CITEL administrations
that plan to use the 1710-1780 MHz / 2110-2180 MHz band for broadband mobile
services, do so by adding additional contiguous bandwidth as an expansion of
the existing bands (1710-1770 MHz / 2110-2170 MHz or 1710-1755 MHz / 2110-2155
MHz in some countries)"_ in [?].
The spectrum 2000-2020/2180-2200MHz is currently allocated to mobile satellite
services in the CITEL countries, while some CITEL countries have also
allocated this spectrum to mobile terrestrial use.
# 5 Band plan allocation and regulatory background
## 5.1. Deployment scenarios
It was agreed in that as part of the band plan evaluation,
**The selected band plan must address various deployment needs of all the
stakeholders of AWS bands**
In order to fulfil this objective, it is necessary to first identify the
various deployment needs of all AWS band stakeholders. An email was sent to
the RAN4 reflector on August 27, 2014 in an attempt to gather input from the
various stakeholders. The responses are summarized in an anonymous manner.
Respondents expressed interest in operating this band in conjunction with
other AWS bands, particularly with the possibility of carrier aggregation.
Interest was expressed in scenarios involving intra-band carrier aggregation,
both contiguous and non-contiguous between AWS-1, AWS-3 paired, and AWS-4 DL
bands, including the ability to span across AWS-1/AWS-3 and AWS-3/AWS-4
boundaries. Inter-band carrier aggregation was also of interest. The more
immediate need for inter-band CA was identified as the aggregation between
Band 2 and AWS-1 and AWS-3 paired. Future needs include inter-band carrier
aggregation with 700 MHz, PCS, and AWS-4 bands.
# 6 List of band specific issues for the extension of the AWS Band
Three possible band plans are included in the SID for further analysis:
Alternative 1: 70+70 (1710 - 1780 MHz / 2110 - 2180 MHz)
Alternative 2: 70+90 (1710 - 1780 MHz / 2110 - 2200 MHz, variable duplex
spacing)
Alternative 3: 85+90 (1695 - 1780 MHz / 2110 - 2200 MHz, variable duplex
spacing)
An additional alternative was also introduced during RAN4#72bis
Alternative 4: 70+90 (1710 - 1780 MHz / 2110 - 2200 MHz, fixed duplex spacing)
• General issues: implications of the different alternative band plans need to
be considered
• E-UTRA specific issues
• UE duplexer analysis
BS Co-existence with base stations operating in adjacent frequency bands
# 7 General issues
## 7.1 Co-existence with base stations operating in adjacent frequency bands
It has be shown in [6, 7] that with the frequency separations between the AWS-
Extension band and Band 4, 23 or 25 frequencies, it could be feasible for the
AWS-Extension band BS TX and RX RF filters to provide the required rejections
to protect the BS receiver from own or different BS transmitter for any of the
3 band plan options.
## 7.2 Alternative 1: 70+70 MHz band plan
This band arrangement would comply with the Basic interoperability requirement
included in [4]. It corresponds to a 25MHz extension of the current Band 4
(1710-1755/2110-2155MHz).
According to [4], the spectrum 1755-1780MHz will be auctioned paired with
2155-2180MHz. Thus, the same duplex spacing as for Band 4 (400MHz).
Conclusion: This is the minimum spectrum to allocate in the band plan and be
compliant with the FCC mandate. It is also the simplest of all the band plans
under study, both from standardization and implementation perspectives..
## 7.3 Alternative 2: 70+90 MHz band plan with variable spacing
This alternative adds 20MHz of DL compared to Alternative 1 and it follows the
FCC expectations on AWS-3 licenses to extend interoperability across AWS-1/3/4
(1710-1780/2110-2200MHz), [4].
The width of the DL operating band is larger than the UL operating band;
therefore it seems straight forward to consider that variable duplex spacing
is needed. When looking into the spectrum allocation more in detail~~ed~~, it
is observed that there are a limited set of possible combinations.
The spectrum within 1710-1755/2110-2155MHz is paired today and
1755-1780/2155-2180MHz will also be auctioned as paired spectrum. The DL
within 2180-2190MHz could potentially be paired together with the DL block
2170-2180MHz (20 MHz DL channel) with the UL at 1770-1780MHz, see Figure
7.3-1. This would imply a different duplex spacing than 400MHz and it may also
include asymmetric UL and DL channel bandwidths
{width="6.6875in" height="1.5451388888888888in"}
Figure 7.3-1: Frequency blocks within 1710-1780/2110-2200MHz and possible
pairings for alternative 2
The DL within 2180-2200MHz could also be used in a CA manner, see Alternative
4.
Conclusion: This alternative follows the FCC expectation on interoperability
across AWS-1/3/4. It requires special look into the necessary duplex
spacing(s),in addition to the fixed spacing of 400MHz. It will require the
inclusion of asymmetric UL and DL channel bandwidths in the standards.
## 7.4. Alternative 3: 85+90 MHz band plan
The UL in this alternative is further extended compared to alternative 2\. In
this scenario, the UL within 1700-1720MHz could be paired with the DL in
2110-2120MHz. This corresponds to a traffic scenario with a UL/DL ratio larger
than one in the entire network. Another pairing alternative could be between
carriers within the UL in 1695-1710MHz and the DL 2180-2200MHz, as illustrated
in Figure 7.4-1 (this is an example of UL/DL traffic ratio greater than one in
the entire network)
{width="6.6875in" height="1.3493055555555555in"}
Figure 7.4-1: Frequency blocks within 1710-1780/2110-2200MHz and possible
pairings for alternative 3
One can think of using the unpaired UL in CA mode (similarly to the use of DL-
only / SDL bands). However, CA has been specified in 3GPP under the
assumptions of (Number of DL CC >= Number of UL CC)
Conclusion: this alternative would require changes across the different 3GPP
specifications and not only RAN4 to enable for the aggregation of more UL than
DL CCs. It also requires special look into the necessary duplex spacing(s). In
addition to the fixed spacing of 400MHz and potentially the inclusion of
asymmetric UL and DL channel bandwidths in the standards.
## 7.5 Alternative 4: 70+90 MHz band plan with fixed spacing
The band plan in this alternative is as in Alternative 2. However, in this
case, only fixed duplex spacing, 400MHz (as per Band 4) is considered. In this
scenario, the DL within 2180-2200MHz is only to be used as SCell (secondary
cell) and it could be aggregated with another DL carrier either within
2110-2180MHz or other band.
Conclusion: this alternative follows the FCC expectation on interoperability
across AWS-1/3/4. It is equivalent to the specification of a 70+70MHz band
plan with additional DL-only spectrum at 2180-2200MHz,
# 8 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
## 8.1 UE duplexer analysis
Table 8.1-1 and Table 8.1-2 show the additional IL compared to Band 4 for a
70+70MHz and 70+90MHz and plans. Data is presented for SAW design at ETC. Both
vendors indicated an additional 0.5 dB insertion loss for Rx for the 70+70
band plan and around 1 dB additional loss for the 70+90 band plan.

shown. Additionally, the increased on TX IL by the increase of the TX passband
from 70MHz to 85MHz is about 0.6dB.

# 12 Conclusions
Various AWS extension candidate band plan options have been studied in the
study item [2,3]:
● Option #1: 70+70 (1710 - 1780 MHz / 2110 - 2180 MHz, fixed duplex)
● Option #2: 70+90 (1710 - 1780 MHz / 2110 - 2200 MHz, variable duplex)
● Option #3: 85+90 (1695 - 1780 MHz / 2110 - 2200 MHz, variable duplex)
● Option #4: 70+90 (1710 - 1780 MHz / 2110 - 2200 MHz, fixed duplex with
downlink intra-band CA across 90 MHz span)
It is concluded that Option 4 is selected. If during the WI for option 4 it is
concluded that interoperability across any part of the band cannot be
achieved, then RAN4 agrees to address those interoperability issues.
