# 5\. Potential Issues
## 5.1 X2 Signalling load reduction for DC operation
### 5.1.1 Potential Issues
Reduction for mobility related signalling load for single connectivity UEs has
been studied in Rel-12 and captured in the TR 36.842 [4]. While the focus in
Rel-12 was on S1 signalling load towards the core network, it might be
beneficial to focus on potential solutions to reduce the X2 signalling load
for DC operation. Solutions that foresee impact on Release-12 UEs shall be
precluded.
### 5.1.2 Conclusion
There is no conclusion during this study.
## 5.2 Increased S1 signalling load due to frequent HOs
### 5.2.1 Potential Issues
TR 36.842 [4] already delivered an upper bound estimation of S1 signalling
load due to HO (i.e. without the assumption of DC being deployed). Figure
5.1.3-1 in TR 36.842 [4] shows the difference for the number of HOs between a
macro only network and a heterogeneous network with 10 small cells per macro
area, which resulted in an increase of 120%-140% depending on the UE speed.
Looking into section 5.1.3 of TR 36.842 [4], an estimation of S1 messages
consumed for HO and connection setup is given in table 5.1.3-2, with varying
RRC Release timer and mobility rate (cell change per minute).
As shown in the Table 5.1.3-2 in TR 36.842 [4], setting an appropriate value
of RRC inactivity timer can reduce the handover signalling efficiently.
The paper [7] also mentions that the network may be able to deal with two
layers of cells (the small cell layer and the macro layer) in a way that
unnecessary mobility signalling can be avoided. The network would apply
reasonable mobility strategies to UEs with medium to higher speeds which would
then be preferably severed on the macro layer. [8] suggests, that for indoor
scenarios, S1 signalling is less likely to happen due, as very low UE mobility
may be assumed.
Several mobility anchor approaches were discussed. It was however identified
that small cells, as long as they are served by individual logical eNBs, would
need to perform an S1 Path Switch Request procedure in case of inter-eNB
handover. The only way to reduce path switch signalling towards the EPC would
be to allow as many neighbouring small cells as possible to be served by a
single logical eNB.
### 5.2.2 Conclusion
No issues have been identified w.r.t. increased S1 signalling load due to
frequent handovers.
## 5.3 Increased non UE associated signalling load
### 5.3.1 Potential Issues
**[Paging]{.underline}**
If network deployments foresee to introduce eNBs serving only a few small
cells, the MME may be impacted in terms of S1 paging signalling load.
Methods to reduce S1 paging signalling load are about to be introduced based
on e.g. an LS received in [9]. The solutions are naturally applicable also for
small cell deployment scenarios.
**[S1-MME connectivity]{.underline}**
Unlike for non-operator deployed eNBs, deployment under operator control is
not expected to be exposed to unreliable or intermittent eNB operation.
MMEs would need to cope with an increased number of S1-MME signalling
connections if network deployments foresee to introduce eNBs serving only a
few small cells, this is however regarded as implementation specific topic and
is out of scope for standardization.
### 5.3.2 Conclusion
No additional issues have been identified w.r.t. increased non-UE associated
signalling.
No issues have been identified w.r.t. S1-MME connectivity due to small cell
deployments.
###### ### Annex A: Increased Signalling Load
TR 36.932 [5] recommends to minimize signalling load (e.g., caused by mobility
to the CN as well as increase of backhaul traffic due to increasing number of
small cell nodes).
Table A-1 shows S1 signalling figures cause by different types of signalling
traffic within a macro LTE network with the inactivity timer set to 20
seconds. It can be seen that the main UE associated signalling towards core
network is caused by service request and handover.
