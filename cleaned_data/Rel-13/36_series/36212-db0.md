# 5 Channel coding, multiplexing and interleaving
Data and control streams from/to MAC layer are encoded /decoded to offer
transport and control services over the radio transmission link. Channel
coding scheme is a combination of error detection, error correcting, rate
matching, interleaving and transport channel or control information mapping
onto/splitting from physical channels.
## 5.1 Generic procedures
This clause contains coding procedures which are used for more than one
transport channel or control information type.
### 5.1.1 CRC calculation
Denote the input bits to the CRC computation
by$a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{A - 1}$, and the parity
bits by$p_{0},p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},p_{L - 1}$. _A_ is
the size of the input sequence and _L_ is the number of parity bits. The
parity bits are generated by one of the following cyclic generator
polynomials:
\- g~CRC24A~(_D_) = [_D_ ^24^ + _D_ ^23^ + _D_ ^18^ + _D_ ^17^ + _D_ ^14^ +
_D_ ^11^ + _D_ ^10^ + _D_ ^7^ + _D_ ^6^ + _D_ ^5^ + _D_ ^4^ + _D_ ^3^ + _D_ \+
1] and;
\- g~CRC24B~(_D_) = [_D_ ^24^ + _D_ ^23^ + _D_ ^6^ + _D_ ^5^ + _D_ \+ 1] for a
CRC length _L_ = 24 and;
\- g~CRC16~(_D_) = [_D_ ^16^ + _D_ ^12^ + _D_ ^5^ + 1] for a CRC length _L_ =
16.
\- g~CRC8~(_D_) = [_D_ ^8^ + _D_ ^7^ + _D_ ^4^ + _D_ ^3^ + _D_ \+ 1] for a CRC
length of _L_ = 8.
The encoding is performed in a systematic form, which means that in GF(2), the
polynomial:
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by the corresponding length-24 CRC
generator polynomial, g~CRC24A~(_D_) or g~CRC24B~(_D_), the polynomial:
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC16~(_D_), and the
polynomial:
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC8~(_D_).
The bits after CRC attachment are denoted
by$b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b_{B - 1}$, where _B_ =
_A_ \+ _L_. The relation between _a~k~_ and _b~k~_ is:
$b_{k} = a_{k}$ for _k_ = 0, 1, 2, ..., _A_ -1
$b_{k} = p_{k - A}$ for _k_ = _A_ , _A_ +1, _A_ +2,..., _A_ +_L_ -1.
### 5.1.2 Code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment
The input bit sequence to the code block segmentation is denoted
by$b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b_{B - 1}$, where _B_ >
0\. If _B_ is larger than the maximum code block size _Z_ , segmentation of
the input bit sequence is performed and an additional CRC sequence of _L_ = 24
bits is attached to each code block. The maximum code block size is:
_\- Z_ = 6144.
If the number of filler bits _F_ calculated below is not 0, filler bits are
added to the beginning of the first block.
Note that if _B \  at the input to the encoder.
Total number of code blocks _C_ is determined by:
if $B \leq Z$
_L_ = 0
Number of code blocks: $C = 1$
else
_L_ = 24
Number of code blocks: $C = \left\lceil \frac{B}{\left( Z - L \right)}
\right\rceil$.
end if
The bits output from code block segmentation, for _C_ ≠ 0, are denoted
by$c_{r0},c_{r1},c_{r2},c_{r3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},c_{r\left( K_{r} - 1
\right)}$ , where _r_ is the code block number, and _K~r~_ is the number of
bits for the code block number _r_.
Number of bits in each code block (applicable for _C_ ≠ 0 only):
First segmentation size: $K_{+}$= minimum _K_ in table 5.1.3-3 such that $C
\cdot K \geq B^{'}$
if $C = 1$
the number of code blocks with length $K_{+}$ is $C_{+}$=1, $K_{-} = 0$,
$C_{-} = 0$
else if $C > 1$
Second segmentation size: $K_{-}$= maximum _K_ in table 5.1.3-3 such that $K 1
The sequence $c_{r0},c_{r1},c_{r2},c_{r3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},c_{r\left(
K_{r} - L - 1 \right)}$ is used to calculate the CRC parity bits
$p_{r0},p_{r1},p_{r2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},p_{r\left( L - 1 \right)}$
according to clause 5.1.1 with the generator polynomial g~CRC24B~(_D_). For
CRC calculation it is assumed that filler bits, if present, have the value 0.
while$k  0, then the encoder shall set
_c~k~_ , = 0, _k_ = 0,...,(_F_ -1) at its input and shall set
$d_{k}^{(0)}\text{=$, _k_ = 0,...,(_F_ -1) and
$d_{k}^{(1)}\text{=$, _k_ = 0,...,(_F_ -1) at its output.
The bits input to the turbo encoder are denoted
by$c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},c_{K - 1}$, and the bits
output from the first and second 8-state constituent encoders are denoted by
$z_{0},z_{1},z_{2},z_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},z_{K -
1}$and$z_{0}^{'},z_{1}^{'},z_{2}^{'},z_{3}^{'},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},z_{K -
1}^{'}$, respectively. The bits output from the turbo code internal
interleaver are denoted by$c_{0}^{'},c_{1}^{'},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},c_{K -
1}^{'}$, and these bits are to be the input to the second 8-state constituent
encoder.
Figure 5.1.3-2: Structure of rate 1/3 turbo encoder (dotted lines apply for
trellis termination only).
##### 5.1.3.2.2 Trellis termination for turbo encoder
Trellis termination is performed by taking the tail bits from the shift
register feedback after all information bits are encoded. Tail bits are padded
after the encoding of information bits.
The first three tail bits shall be used to terminate the first constituent
encoder (upper switch of figure 5.1.3-2 in lower position) while the second
constituent encoder is disabled. The last three tail bits shall be used to
terminate the second constituent encoder (lower switch of figure 5.1.3-2 in
lower position) while the first constituent encoder is disabled.
The transmitted bits for trellis termination shall then be:
$d_{K}^{(0)} = x_{K}$, $d_{K + 1}^{(0)} = z_{K + 1}$, $d_{K + 2}^{(0)} =
x_{K}^{'}$, $d_{K + 3}^{(0)} = z_{K + 1}^{'}$
$d_{K}^{(1)} = z_{K}$, $d_{K + 1}^{(1)} = x_{K + 2}$, $d_{K + 2}^{(1)} =
z_{K}^{'}$, $d_{K + 3}^{(1)} = x_{K + 2}^{'}$
$d_{K}^{(2)} = x_{K + 1}$, $d_{K + 1}^{(2)} = z_{K + 2}$, $d_{K + 2}^{(2)} =
x_{K + 1}^{'}$, $d_{K + 3}^{(2)} = z_{K + 2}^{'}$
##### 5.1.3.2.3 Turbo code internal interleaver
The bits input to the turbo code internal interleaver are denoted
by$c_{0},c_{1},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},c_{K - 1}$, where _K_ is the number of
input bits. The bits output from the turbo code internal interleaver are
denoted by$c_{0}^{'},c_{1}^{'},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},c_{K - 1}^{'}$.
The relationship between the input and output bits is as follows:
$c_{i}^{'} = c_{\Pi\left( i \right)}$, _i_ =0, 1,..., (_K_ -1)
where the relationship between the output index _i_ and the input index
$\Pi(i)$ satisfies the following quadratic form:
The parameters $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ depend on the block size _K_ and are
summarized in Table 5.1.3-3.

### 5.1.4 Rate matching
#### 5.1.4.1 Rate matching for turbo coded transport channels
The rate matching for turbo coded transport channels is defined per coded
block and consists of interleaving the three information bit
streams$d_{k}^{(0)}$, $d_{k}^{(1)}$ and$d_{k}^{(2)}$, followed by the
collection of bits and the generation of a circular buffer as depicted in
Figure 5.1.4-1. The output bits for each code block are transmitted as
described in clause 5.1.4.1.2.
Figure 5.1.4-1. Rate matching for turbo coded transport channels.
The bit stream $d_{k}^{(0)}$is interleaved according to the sub-block
interleaver defined in clause 5.1.4.1.1 with an output sequence defined as
$v_{0}^{(0)},v_{1}^{(0)},v_{2}^{(0)},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},v_{K_{\Pi} -
1}^{(0)}$and where$K_{\Pi}$ is defined in clause 5.1.4.1.1.
The bit stream $d_{k}^{(1)}$ is interleaved according to the sub-block
interleaver defined in clause 5.1.4.1.1 with an output sequence defined
as$v_{0}^{(1)},v_{1}^{(1)},v_{2}^{(1)},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},v_{K_{\Pi} -
1}^{(1)}$.
The bit stream $d_{k}^{(2)}$ is interleaved according to the sub-block
interleaver defined in clause 5.1.4.1.1 with an output sequence defined
as$v_{0}^{(2)},v_{1}^{(2)},v_{2}^{(2)},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},v_{K_{\Pi} -
1}^{(2)}$.
The sequence of bits $e_{k}$ for transmission is generated according to clause
5.1.4.1.2.
##### 5.1.4.1.1 Sub-block interleaver
The bits input to the block interleaver are denoted by
$d_{0}^{(i)},d_{1}^{(i)},d_{2}^{(i)},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d_{D -
1}^{(i)}$, where _D_ is the number of bits. The output bit sequence from the
block interleaver is derived as follows:
(1) Assign $C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{TC}} = \text{32}$to be the number of
columns of the matrix. The columns of the matrix are numbered 0, 1,
2,...,$C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{TC}} - 1$from left to right.
(2) Determine the number of rows of the
matrix$R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{TC}}$, by finding minimum integer
$R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{TC}}$ such that:
The rows of rectangular matrix are numbered 0, 1,
2,...,$R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{TC}} - 1$from top to bottom.
(3) If$\left( R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{TC}} \times
C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{TC}} \right) > D$, then $N_{D} = \left(
R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{TC}} \times C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{TC}} - D
\right)$ dummy bits are padded such that _y~k~_ = \ for _k_ = 0,

$d_{k}^{(1)}$ and $d_{k}^{(2)}$, followed by the collection of bits and the
generation of a circular buffer as depicted in Figure 5.1.4-2. The output bits
are transmitted as described in clause 5.1.4.2.2.
Figure 5.1.4-2. Rate matching for convolutionally coded transport channels and

The bit stream $d_{k}^{(0)}$ is interleaved according to the sub-block
interleaver defined in clause 5.1.4.2.1 with an output sequence defined as
$v_{0}^{(0)},v_{1}^{(0)},v_{2}^{(0)},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},v_{K_{\Pi} -
1}^{(0)}$ and where $K_{\Pi}$ is defined in clause 5.1.4.2.1.

The sequence of bits $e_{k}$ for transmission is generated according to clause
5.1.4.2.2.
##### 5.1.4.2.1 Sub-block interleaver
The bits input to the block interleaver are denoted
by$d_{0}^{(i)},d_{1}^{(i)},d_{2}^{(i)},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d_{D -
1}^{(i)}$, where _D_ is the number of bits. The output bit sequence from the
block interleaver is derived as follows:
(1) Assign$C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}} = \text{32}$to be the number of
columns of the matrix. The columns of the matrix are numbered 0, 1,
2,...,$C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}} - 1$from left to right.

matrix$R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}}$, by finding minimum integer
$R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}}$ such that:
The rows of rectangular matrix are numbered 0, 1,
2,...,$R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}} - 1$from top to bottom.
(3) If$\left( R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}} \times

-1, and the bit sequence _y~k~_ is written into the$\left(
R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}} \times C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}}
\right)$ matrix row by row starting with bit _y_ ~0~ in column 0 of row 0:
(4) Perform the inter-column permutation for the matrix based on the
pattern$\left\langle P\left( j \right) \right\rangle_{j \in \left{
0,1,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}} - 1 \right}}$
that is shown in table 5.1.4-2, where P(_j_) is the original column position
of the _j_ -th permuted column. After permutation of the columns, the inter-
column permuted$\left( R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}} \times

1) \times C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}}} \ \end{bmatrix}$
(5) The output of the block interleaver is the bit sequence read out column by
column from the inter-column permuted$\left( R_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}}
\times C_{\text{subblock}}^{\text{CC}} \right)$matrix. The bits after sub-
block interleaving are denoted

Denoting by _E_ the rate matching output sequence length, the rate matching
output bit sequence is $e_{k}$, _k_ = 0,1,..., $E - 1$.
Set _k_ = 0 and _j_ = 0
while {_k_ \$
_k_ = _k_ +1

### 5.1.5 Code block concatenation
The input bit sequence for the code block concatenation block are the
sequences $e_{\text{rk}}$, for $r = 0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},C - 1$ and $k =
0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},E_{r} - 1$. The output bit sequence from the code
block concatenation block is the sequence $f_{k}$ for $k =
0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},G - 1$.
The code block concatenation consists of sequentially concatenating the rate
matching outputs for the different code blocks. Therefore,
Set $k = 0$ and $r = 0$
while $r  \text{11}$ with
$O_{1} = \left\lceil \frac{O}{2} \right\rceil$ and $O_{2} = O - \left\lceil
\frac{O}{2} \right\rceil$.

scheduled bandwidths for PUSCH transmission in the initial sub-frame for the
first and second transport block, respectively, expressed as a number of
subcarriers in [2], and
\- $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PUSCH-initial}(x)},x = \left{ 1,2 \right}$are the
number of SC-FDMA symbols per subframe for initial PUSCH transmission for the
first and second transport block given by $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PUSCH-
initial}(x)} = \left( 2 \cdot \left( N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{UL}} - 1 \right) -
N_{\text{SRS}}^{(x)} \right),x = \left{ 1,2 \right}$, where
\- $N_{\text{SRS}}^{(x)},x = \left{ 1,2 \right}$ is equal to 1
\- if UE configured with one UL cell is configured to send PUSCH and SRS in
the same subframe for initial transmission, or
\- if UE transmits PUSCH and SRS in the same subframe in the same serving cell
for initial transmission of transport block \"_x\"_ , or
\- if the PUSCH resource allocation for initial transmission of transport bock
\"_x\"_ even partially overlaps with the cell-specific SRS subframe and
bandwidth configuration defined in clause 5.5.3 of [2] , or
\- if the subframe for initial transmission of transport block \"_x_ \" in the
same serving cell is a UE-specific type-1 SRS subframe as defined in Clause
8.2 of [3], or
\- if the subframe for initial transmission of transport block \"_x_ \" in the
same serving cell is a UE-specific type-0 SRS subframe as defined in clause
8.2 of [3] and the UE is configured with multiple TAGs.
\- Otherwise $N_{\text{SRS}}^{(x)},x = \left{ 1,2 \right}$ is equal to 0.
\- $M_{\text{sc}}^{\text{PUSCH} - \text{initial}(x)},x = \left{ 1,2 \right}$,
$C^{(x)},x = \left{ 1,2 \right}$, and $K_{r}^{(x)},x = \left{ 1,2 \right}$ are
obtained from the initial PDCCH or EPDCCH for the corresponding transport
block.
For HARQ-ACK, $Q_{\text{ACK}} = Q_{m} \cdot Q^{'}$ and
$\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{PUSCH}} = \beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{HARQ} -
\text{ACK}}$, where $Q_{m}$is the modulation order of a given transport block.
For UEs configured with no more than five DL cells,
$\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK}}$ shall be determined
according to [3] depending on the number of transmission codewords for the
corresponding PUSCH. For UEs configured with more than five DL cells,
$\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK}}$ shall be determined
according to [3] depending on the number of transmission codewords for the
corresponding PUSCH and and the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits.
For rank indication or CRI, $Q_{\text{RI}} = Q_{m} \cdot Q^{'}$,
$Q_{\text{CRI}} = Q_{m} \cdot Q^{'}$ and $\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{PUSCH}}
= \beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{RI}}$, where$Q_{m}$is the modulation order of a
given transport block, and $\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{RI}}$ shall be
determined according to [3] depending on the number of transmission codewords
for the corresponding PUSCH, and on the uplink power control subframe set for
the corresponding PUSCH when two uplink power control subframe sets are
configured by higher layers for the cell.
For HARQ-ACK
\- Each positive acknowledgement (ACK) is encoded as a binary \'1\' and each
negative acknowledgement (NACK) is encoded as a binary \'0\'
\- If HARQ-ACK feedback consists of 1-bit of information, i.e., $\lbrack
o_{0}^{\text{ACK}}\rbrack$, it is first encoded according to Table 5.2.2.6-1.
\- If HARQ-ACK feedback consists of 2-bits of information, i.e., $\lbrack

corresponding to that for codeword 1, or if HARQ-ACK feedback consists of
2-bits of information as a result of the aggregation of HARQ-ACK bits
corresponding to two DL cells with which the UE is configured by higher
layers, or if HARQ-ACK feedback consists of 2-bits of information
corresponding to two subframes for TDD, it is first encoded according to Table
5.2.2.6-2 where $o_{2}^{\text{ACK}} = (o_{0}^{\text{ACK}} +
o_{1}^{\text{ACK}})\text{mod}2$.

\- If HARQ-ACK feedback consists of $3 \leq O^{\text{ACK}} \leq \text{11}$
bits of information as a result of the aggregation of HARQ-ACK bits
corresponding to one or more DL cells with which the UE is configured by
higher layers, i.e.,
$o_{0}^{\text{ACK}}o_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},o_{O^{\text{ACK}}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$, then a coded bit sequence
${\overset{\sim}{q}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}}{\overset{\sim}{q}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\overset{\sim}{q}}_{\text{31}}^{\text{ACK}}$
is obtained by using the bit sequence
$o_{0}^{\text{ACK}}o_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},o_{O^{\text{ACK}}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ as the input to the channel coding block described in
clause 5.2.2.6.4. In turn, the bit sequence
$q_{0}^{\text{ACK}},q_{1}^{\text{ACK}},q_{2}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},q_{Q_{\text{ACK}}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ is obtained by the circular repetition of the bit sequence
${\overset{\sim}{q}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}}{\overset{\sim}{q}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\overset{\sim}{q}}_{\text{31}}^{\text{ACK}}$
so that the total bit sequence length is equal to$Q_{\text{ACK}}$.

the UE is configured by higher layers, i.e.,

$q_{0}^{\text{ACK}},q_{1}^{\text{ACK}},q_{2}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},q_{Q_{\text{ACK}}

clause 5.2.2.6.5.
\- If HARQ-ACK feedback consists of bits of information as a result of the
aggregation of HARQ-ACK bits corresponding to one or more DL cells with which

the HARQ-ACK bits are performed according to clauses 5.1.1 setting _L_ to 8
bits, 5.1.3.1 and 5.1.4.2, respectively. The input bit sequence to the CRC
attachment operation is
$o_{0}^{\text{ACK}}o_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},o_{O^{\text{ACK}}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$. The output bit sequence of the CRC attachment operation is
the input bit sequence to the channel coding operation. The output bit
sequence of the channel coding operation is the input bit sequence to the rate
matching operation.
The \"x\" and \"y\" in Table 5.2.2.6-1 and 5.2.2.6-2 are placeholders for [2]
to scramble the HARQ-ACK bits in a way that maximizes the Euclidean distance
of the modulation symbols carrying HARQ-ACK information.
For FDD or TDD HARQ-ACK multiplexing or the aggregation of more than one DL
cell including at least one cell using FDD and at least one cell using TDD
when HARQ-ACK consists of one or two bits of information, the bit sequence
$q_{0}^{\text{ACK}},q_{1}^{\text{ACK}},q_{2}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},q_{Q_{\text{ACK}}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ is obtained by concatenation of multiple encoded HARQ-ACK
blocks where $Q_{\text{ACK}}$ is the total number of coded bits for all the
encoded HARQ-ACK blocks. The last concatenation of the encoded HARQ-ACK block
may be partial so that the total bit sequence length is equal
to$Q_{\text{ACK}}$.
For UEs configured by higher layers with _codebooksizeDetermination-r13 = dai_
, the bit sequence is determined according to the Downlink Assignment Index
(DAI) as in Table 5.3.3.1.2-2 and as defined in [3]. Otherwise, the bit
sequence is determined as below.
For FDD when HARQ ACK consists of 2 or more bits of information as a result of
the aggregation of more than one DL cell, the bit sequence is the result of
the concatenation of HARQ-ACK bits for the multiple DL cells according to the
following pseudo-code:
Set _c_ = 0 -- cell index: lower indices correspond to lower RRC indices of
corresponding cell
Set _j_ = 0 -- HARQ-ACK bit index
Set $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$ to the number of cells configured by higher

5.2.2.6.3-3, Table 5.2.2.6.3-3B, and the CRI sequence in Table 5.2.2.6.3-3A
are encoded according to clause 5.2.2.6.
For transmission mode 9/10 configured with Class B CSI reporting and K>1, the
number of antenna port in Table 5.2.2.6.3-3B refers to the maximum number of
antenna ports of K CSI-RS resources configured for the CSI-process for the UE.
##### 5.2.2.6.4 Channel coding for CQI/PMI information in PUSCH
The channel quality bits input to the channel coding block are denoted by
$o_{0},o_{1},o_{2},o_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},o_{O - 1}$ where _O_ is the
number of bits. The number of channel quality bits depends on the transmission
format. When PUCCH-based reporting format is used, the number of CQI/PMI bits
is defined in clause 5.2.3.3.1 for wideband reports and in clause 5.2.3.3.2
for UE selected subbands reports. When PUSCH-based reporting format is used,
the number of CQI/PMI bits is defined in clause 5.2.2.6.1 for wideband
reports, in clause 5.2.2.6.2 for higher layer configured subbands reports and
in clause 5.2.2.6.3 for UE selected subbands reports.
The channel quality information is first coded using a (32, _O_) block code.
The code words of the (32, _O_) block code are a linear combination of the 11
basis sequences denoted M~i,n~ and defined in Table 5.2.2.6.4-1.
**Table 5.2.2.6.4-1: Basis sequences for (32,_O_) code.**

The encoded CQI/PMI block is denoted by
$b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b_{B - 1}$ where $B =
\text{32}$ and
$b_{i} = \sum_{n = 0}^{O - 1}{\left( o_{n} \cdot M_{i,n} \right)\text{mod}2}$
where _i_ = 0, 1, 2, ..., _B_ -1.
The output bit sequence is obtained by circular repetition of the encoded
CQI/PMI block as follows
$q_{i} = b_{\left( i\text{mod}B \right)}$ where _i_ = 0, 1, 2, ...,
_N~L·~Q~CQI~_ -1, where _N~L~_ is the number of layers the corresponding UL-
SCH transport block is mapped onto .
##### 5.2.2.6.5 Channel coding for more than 11 bits of HARQ-ACK information
The HARQ-ACK bits input to the channel coding block are denoted by
$o_{0}^{\text{ACK}}o_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},o_{O^{\text{ACK}}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ where is the number of bits.
The sequences of bits
$o_{0}^{\text{ACK}},o_{1}^{\text{ACK}},o_{2}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},o_{\left\lceil
\frac{O^{\text{ACK}}}{2} \right\rceil - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ and $o_{\left\lceil
\frac{O^{\text{ACK}}}{2} \right\rceil}^{\text{ACK}},o_{\left\lceil
\frac{O^{\text{ACK}}}{2} \right\rceil + 1}^{\text{ACK}},o_{\left\lceil
\frac{O^{\text{ACK}}}{2} \right\rceil +
2}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},o_{O^{\text{ACK}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$
are encoded as follows
${\overset{\sim}{q}}_{i} = \sum_{n = 0}^{{}_{\left\lceil
\frac{O^{\text{ACK}}}{2} \right\rceil - 1}}{\left( o_{n}^{\text{ACK}} \cdot
M_{i,n} \right)\text{mod}2}$
and
where _i_ = 0, 1, 2, ..., 31 and the basis sequences $M_{i,n}$ are defined in
Table 5.2.2.6.4-1.
The output bit sequence
$q_{0}^{\text{ACK}},q_{1}^{\text{ACK}},q_{2}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},q_{Q_{\text{ACK}}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ is obtained by the concatenation and circular repetition of
the bit sequences
${{\overset{\sim}{q}}_{0},{\overset{\sim}{q}}_{1},{\overset{\sim}{q}}_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{,,\
{}\overset{\sim}{q}}_{\text{31}}$ and
${{\overset{\sim}{\overset{\sim}{q}}}_{0},{\overset{\sim}{\overset{\sim}{q}}}_{1},{\overset{\sim}{\overset{\sim}{q}}}_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{,,\
{}\overset{\sim}{\overset{\sim}{q}}}_{\text{31}}$ as follows:
Set _i_ = 0
while $i  0$, or if $k_{b} +
O^{\text{CSI}} + O^{\text{SR}} > \text{22}$ and $k \leq k_{\text{max}}$, then
\- $O^{\text{ACK}} = k$
else,
\- $O^{\text{ACK}} = k_{b}$.
For PUCCH format 4 or PUCCH format 5, $O^{\text{ACK}} = k$ if the UE is not
configured with spatial bundling on PUCCH by higher layers; otherwise
$O^{\text{ACK}} = k_{b}$.
If $O^{\text{ACK}} = k$, the multiplexing of HARQ-ACK bits is performed
according to the following pseudo-code:
Set _c_ = 0 -- cell index: lower indices correspond to lower RRC indices of
corresponding cell
Set _j_ = 0 -- HARQ-ACK bit index

The channel quality bits in Table 5.2.3.3.1-1 through Table 5.2.3.3.1-4 form
the bit sequence $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{A - 1}$
with $a_{0}$ corresponding to the first bit of the first field in each of the
tables, $a_{1}$ corresponding to the second bit of the first field in each of
the tables, and $a_{A - 1}$ corresponding to the last bit in the last field in
each of the tables. The first bit of each field corresponds to MSB and the
last bit LSB. The RI feedback for one bit is mapped according to Table
5.2.2.6-5 with $o_{0}^{\text{RI}}$ replaced by $a_{0}$. The RI feedback for
two bits is mapped according to Table 5.2.2.6-6 with $o_{0}^{\text{RI}}$,
$o_{1}^{\text{RI}}$ replaced by $a_{0},a_{1}$. The RI feedback for three bits
is mapped according to Table 5.2.2.6-7 with $o_{0}^{\text{RI}}$,
$o_{1}^{\text{RI}}$, $o_{2}^{\text{RI}}$ replaced by $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2}$. The
same procedures for RI mapping are applied to CRI, replacing RI with CRI. The
mapping for the jointly coded RI and i1 is provided in Table 7.2.2-1E of [3].
When multiplexed with UL-SCH, the channel coding and multiplexing for the

5.2.3.3.1-3B, Table 5.2.3.3.1-3C and Table 5.2.3.3.1-3D is performed assuming
RI transmission in clause 5.2.2.6. All other transmission configurations in
this clause are coded and multiplexed assuming CQI/PMI transmission in clause
5.2.2.6.
For transmission mode 9/10 configured with Class B CSI reporting and K>1, the
number of antenna port in Table 5.2.3.3.1-3C, 5.2.3.3.1-3D refers to the

#### 5.2.3.4 Channel coding for UCI channel quality information and HARQ-ACK
This clause defines the channel coding scheme for the simultaneous
transmission of channel quality information and HARQ-ACK information in a
subframe.
When normal CP is used for uplink transmission, the channel quality
information is coded according to clause 5.2.3.3 with input bit sequence
$a_{0}^{'},a_{1}^{'},a_{2}^{'},a_{3}^{'},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{A^{'} -
1}^{'}$ and output bit sequence
$b_{0}^{'},b_{1}^{'},b_{2}^{'},b_{3}^{'},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b_{B^{'} -
1}^{'}$, where $B^{'} = \text{20}$. The HARQ-ACK bits are denoted by
$a_{0}^{''}$ in case one HARQ-ACK bit or $a_{0}^{''},a_{1}^{''}$ in case two
HARQ-ACK bits are reported per subframe. Each positive acknowledgement (ACK)
is encoded as a binary \'1\' and each negative acknowledgement (NACK) is
encoded as a binary \'0\'.
The output of this channel coding block for normal CP is denoted by
$b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b_{B - 1}$, where
In case one HARQ-ACK bit is reported per subframe:
$b_{B^{'}} = a_{0}^{''}$ and $B = \left( B^{'} + 1 \right)$
In case two HARQ-ACK bits are reported per subframe:
$b_{B^{'}} = a_{0}^{''},b_{B^{'} + 1} = a_{1}^{''}$ and $B = \left( B^{'} + 2
\right)$
When extended CP is used for uplink transmission, the channel quality
information and the HARQ-ACK bits are jointly coded. The HARQ-ACK bits are
denoted by $a_{0}^{''}$ in case one HARQ-ACK bit or $\left\lbrack
a_{0}^{''},a_{1}^{''} \right\rbrack$ in case two HARQ-ACK bits are reported
per subframe.
The channel quality information denoted by
$a_{0}^{'},a_{1}^{'},a_{2}^{'},a_{3}^{'},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{A^{'} -
1}^{'}$ is multiplexed with the HARQ-ACK bits to yield the sequence
$a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{A - 1}$ as follows
and
$a_{A^{'}} = a_{0}^{''}$ and $A = \left( A^{'} + 1 \right)$ in case one HARQ-
ACK bit is reported per subframe, or
$a_{A^{'}} = a_{0}^{''}$, $a_{\left( A^{'} + 1 \right)} = a_{1}^{''}$ and $A =
\left( A^{'} + 2 \right)$ in case two HARQ-ACK bits are reported per subframe.
The sequence $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{A - 1}$ is
encoded according to clause 5.2.3.3 to yield the output bit sequence
$b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},b_{B - 1}$ where $B =
\text{20}$.
### 5.2.4 Uplink control information on PUSCH without UL-SCH data
When control data are sent via PUSCH without UL-SCH data, the following coding
steps can be identified:
\- Channel coding of control information
\- Control information mapping
\- Channel interleaver
#### 5.2.4.1 Channel coding of control information
Control data arrives at the coding unit in the form of channel quality
information (CQI and/or PMI), HARQ-ACK and rank indication. Different coding
rates for the control information are achieved by allocating different number
of coded symbols for its transmission. When the UE transmits HARQ-ACK bits or
rank indicator bits, it shall determine the number of coded symbols $Q^{'}$
for HARQ-ACK or rank indicator as
$Q^{'} = \text{min}\left( \left\lceil \frac{O \cdot
M_{\text{sc}}^{\text{PUSCH}} \cdot N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PUSCH}} \cdot
\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{PUSCH}}}{O_{\text{CQI} - \text{MIN}}}
\right\rceil,\ 4\ \cdot \ M_{\text{sc}}^{\text{PUSCH}} \right)$
where $O$ is the number of HARQ-ACK bits as defined in clause 5.2.2.6, or rank
indicator bits, $O_{\text{CQI} - \text{MIN}}$ is the number of CQI bits
including CRC bits assuming rank equals to 1 for all serving cells for which
an aperiodic CSI report is triggered [3], $M_{\text{sc}}^{\text{PUSCH}}$ is
the scheduled bandwidth for PUSCH transmission in the current subframe
expressed as a number of subcarriers in [2], and
$N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PUSCH}}$is the number of SC-FDMA symbols in the
current PUSCH transmission sub-frame given by{width="1.875in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where $N_{\text{SRS}}$is equal to 1 if UE is
configured to send PUSCH and SRS in the same subframe for the current
subframe, or if the PUSCH resource allocation for the current subframe even
partially overlaps with the cell-specific SRS subframe and bandwidth
configuration defined in clause 5.5.3 of [2], or if the current subframe is a
UE-specific type-1 SRS subframe as defined in Clause 8.2 of [3], or if the
current subframe is a UE-specific type-0 SRS subframe as defined in clause 8.2
of [3] and the UE is configured with multiple TAGs. Otherwise
$N_{\text{SRS}}$is equal to 0.
For HARQ-ACK information $Q_{\text{ACK}} = Q_{m} \cdot Q^{'}$ and
[$\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{PUSCH}} = \beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{HARQ} -
\text{ACK}}/\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{CQI}}$]. For UEs configured with no
more than five DL cells, $\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK}}$
shall be determined according to [3]. For UEs configured with more than five
DL cells, $\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK}}$ shall be
determined according to [3] depending on the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits.
For rank indication or CRI, $Q_{\text{RI}} = Q_{m} \cdot Q^{'}$,
$Q_{\text{CRI}} = Q_{m} \cdot Q^{'}$ and
[$\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{PUSCH}} =
\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{RI}}/\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{CQI}}$], where
$\beta_{\text{offset}}^{\text{RI}}$ shall be determined according to [3].
For CQI and/or PMI information $Q_{\text{CQI}} =
N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PUSCH}} \cdot M_{\text{sc}}^{\text{PUSCH}} \cdot Q_{m}
- Q_{\text{RI}}$.
The channel coding and rate matching of the control data is performed
according to clause 5.2.2.6. The coded output sequence for channel quality
information is denoted by
$q_{0},q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},q_{Q_{\text{CQI}} - 1}$, the
coded vector sequence output for HARQ-ACK is denoted by
${\underline{q}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}},{\underline{q}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},{\underline{q}}_{2}^{\text{ACK}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\underline{q}}_{Q_{\text{ACK}}^{'}
- 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ and the coded vector sequence output for rank indication or
CRI, is denoted by
${\underline{q}}_{0}^{\text{RI}},{\underline{q}}_{1}^{\text{RI}},{\underline{q}}_{2}^{\text{RI}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\underline{q}}_{Q_{\text{RI}}^{'}
- 1}^{\text{RI}}$.
#### 5.2.4.2 Control information mapping
The input are the coded bits of the channel quality information denoted by
$q_{0},q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},q_{Q_{\text{CQI}} - 1}$. The
output is denoted by
${\underline{g}}_{0},{\underline{g}}_{1},{\underline{g}}_{2},{\underline{g}}_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\underline{g}}_{H^{'}
- 1}$, where $H = Q_{\text{CQI}}$ and $H^{'} = \frac{H}{Q_{m}}$, and
where${\underline{g}}_{i}$, $i = 0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},H^{'} - 1$ are
column vectors of length $Q_{m}$. _H_ is the total number of coded bits
allocated for CQI/PMI information.
The control information shall be mapped as follows:
Set _j_ , _k_ to 0
while $j $

#### 5.3.1.2 Channel coding
Information bits are delivered to the channel coding block. They are denoted
by$c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},c_{K - 1}$ , where _K_ is
the number of bits, and they are tail biting convolutionally encoded according
to clause 5.1.3.1.
After encoding the bits are denoted
by$d_{0}^{(i)},d_{1}^{(i)},d_{2}^{(i)},d_{3}^{(i)},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d_{D
- 1}^{(i)}$, with$i = 0,1,\text{\ and\ }2$, and where _D_ is the number of
bits on the _i_ -th coded stream, i.e., $D = K$.
#### 5.3.1.3 Rate matching
A tail biting convolutionally coded block is delivered to the rate matching
block. This block of coded bits is denoted
by$d_{0}^{(i)},d_{1}^{(i)},d_{2}^{(i)},d_{3}^{(i)},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d_{D
- 1}^{(i)}$, with$i = 0,1,\text{\ and\ }2$, and where _i_ is the coded stream
index and _D_ is the number of bits in each coded stream. This coded block is
rate matched according to clause 5.1.4.2.
After rate matching, the bits are denoted
by$e_{0},e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},e_{E - 1}$, where _E_ is
the number of rate matched bits as defined in clause 6.6.1 of [2].
### 5.3.2 Downlink shared channel, Paging channel and Multicast channel
Figure 5.3.2-1 shows the processing structure for each transport block for the
DL-SCH, PCH and MCH transport channels. Data arrives to the coding unit in the
form of a maximum of two transport blocks every transmission time interval
(TTI) per DL cell. The following coding steps can be identified for each
transport block of a DL cell:
\- Add CRC to the transport block
\- Code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment
\- Channel coding
\- Rate matching
\- Code block concatenation
The coding steps for PCH and MCH transport channels, and for one transport
block of DL-SCH are shown in the figure below. The same processing applies for
each transport block on each DL cell.
Figure 5.3.2-1: Transport block processing for DL-SCH, PCH and MCH.
#### 5.3.2.1 Transport block CRC attachment
Error detection is provided on transport blocks through a Cyclic Redundancy
Check (CRC).
The entire transport block is used to calculate the CRC parity bits. Denote
the bits in a transport block delivered to layer 1
by$a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{A - 1}$, and the parity
bits by$p_{0},p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},p_{L - 1}$. _A_ is
the size of the transport block and _L_ is the number of parity bits. The
lowest order information bit _a_ ~0~ is mapped to the most significant bit of
the transport block as defined in clause 6.1.1 of [5].
The parity bits are computed and attached to the transport block according to
clause 5.1.1 setting _L_ to 24 bits and using the generator polynomial
g~CRC24A~(_D_).
#### 5.3.2.2 Code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment

\right)}$, where _r_ is the code block number and _K~r~_ is the number of bits
for code block number _r_.

the number of bits on the _i_ -th coded stream for code block number _r_ ,
i.e.$D_{r} = K_{r} + 4$.
#### 5.3.2.4 Rate matching
Turbo coded blocks are delivered to the rate matching block. They are denoted
by$d_{r0}^{(i)},d_{r1}^{(i)},d_{r2}^{(i)},d_{r3}^{(i)},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},d_{r\left(
D_{r} - 1 \right)}^{(i)}$, with$i = 0,1,\text{\ and\ }2$, and where _r_ is the
code block number, _i_ is the coded stream index, and $D_{r}$ is the number of
bits in each coded stream of code block number _r_. The total number of code
blocks is denoted by _C_ and each coded block is individually rate matched

by$e_{r0},e_{r1},e_{r2},e_{r3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},e_{r\left( E_{r} - 1
\right)}$, where _r_ is the coded block number, and where $E_{r}$ is the
number of rate matched bits for code block number _r_.
#### 5.3.2.5 Code block concatenation
The bits input to the code block concatenation block are denoted by
$e_{r0},e_{r1},e_{r2},e_{r3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},e_{r\left( E_{r} - 1
\right)}$ for $r = 0,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},C - 1$ and where $E_{r}$ is the

the total number of coded bits for transmission. This sequence of coded bits
corresponding to one transport block after code block concatenation is
referred to as one codeword in clause 6.3.1 of [2]. In case of multiple
transport blocks per TTI, the transport block to codeword mapping is specified

### 5.3.3 Downlink control information
A DCI transports downlink, uplink or sidelink scheduling information, requests
for aperiodic CQI reports, LAA common information, notifications of MCCH
change [6] or uplink power control commands for one cell and one RNTI. The
RNTI is implicitly encoded in the CRC.
Figure 5.3.3-1 shows the processing structure for one DCI. The following
coding steps can be identified:
\- Information element multiplexing
\- CRC attachment
\- Channel coding
\- Rate matching
The coding steps for DCI are shown in the figure below.

#### 5.3.3.1 DCI formats
The fields defined in the DCI formats below are mapped to the information bits

Each field is mapped in the order in which it appears in the description,
including the zero-padding bit(s), if any, with the first field mapped to the
lowest order information bit _a_ ~0~ and each successive field mapped to
higher order information bits. The most significant bit of each field is
mapped to the lowest order information bit for that field, e.g. the most
significant bit of the first field is mapped to _a_ ~0~.

The interpretation of the precoding information field depends on the number of
enabled codewords according to Table 5.3.3.1.5-4 and Table 5.3.3.1.5-5. Note
that TPMI indicates which codebook index is used in Table 6.3.4.2.3-1 or Table
6.3.4.2.3-2 of [2]. For a single enabled codeword, indices 18 to 34 inclusive
in Table 5.3.3.1.5-5 are only supported for retransmission of the
corresponding transport block if that transport block has previously been
transmitted using two layers with closed-loop spatial multiplexing.
If the number of information bits in format 2 carried by PDCCH belongs to one
of the sizes in Table 5.3.3.1.2-1, one zero bit shall be appended to format 2.
Some entries in Table 5.3.3.1.5-4 and Table 5.3.3.1.5-5 are used for
indicating that the eNodeB has applied precoding according to PMI(s) reported
by the UE. In these cases the precoding for the corresponding RB(s) in
subframe _n_ is according to the latest PMI(s) in an aperiodic CSI reported on
or before subframe _n_ -4. For aperiodic CSI mode 2-2: Precoding of scheduled
resource blocks belonging to the reported preferred M subband(s) use
precoder(s) according to the preferred M subband PMI indicated by the latest
aperiodic CSI report; Precoding of scheduled resource blocks not belonging to
the reported preferred M subband(s) use a precoder according to the wideband
PMI indicated by the latest aperiodic CSI report.

#### 5.4.1.1 Transport block CRC attachment
Error detection is provided on transport blocks through a Cyclic Redundancy
Check (CRC).
The entire transport block is used to calculate the CRC parity bits. Denote

by$a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{A - 1}$, and the parity
bits by$p_{0},p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},p_{L - 1}$. _A_ is
the size of the transport block and _L_ is the number of parity bits. The

the transport block as defined in clause 6.1.1 of [5].
The parity bits are computed and attached according to clause 5.1.1 setting
_L_ to 16 bits, resulting in the sequence of
bits$c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},c_{K - 1}$ where $c_{k}
= b_{k}$ for _k_ = 0, 1, 2, ..., _K_ -1 and _K=A+L_.

bits on the _i_ -th coded stream, i.e., $D = K$.
#### 5.4.1.3 Rate matching
A tail biting convolutionally coded block is delivered to the rate matching
block. This block of coded bits is denoted

of a maximum of one transport blocks over a number of resource units per DL
cell. The following coding steps can be identified for each transport block of
a DL cell:
\- CRC attachment
\- Channel coding
\- Rate matching
Figure 6.4.2-1: Transport block processing for DL-SCH and PCH.
The CRC attachment, channel coding, and rate matching is performed according
to clauses 5.1.1, 5.1.3.1 and 5.1.4.2, respectively. For the CRC attachment,
the parity bits are computed and attached according to clause 5.1.1 setting
_L_ to 24 bits, resulting in the sequence of
bits$c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},c_{K - 1}$ where $c_{k}
= b_{k}$ for _k_ = 0, 1, 2, ..., _K_ -1 and _K=A+L_.
### 6.4.3 Downlink control information
A DCI transports downlink or uplink scheduling information for one cell and
one RNTI. The RNTI is implicitly encoded in the CRC. The processing structure
for one DCI is according to Clause 5.3.3.
#### 6.4.3.1 DCI Format N0
DCI format N0 is used for the scheduling of NPUSCH in one UL cell.
The following information is transmitted by means of the DCI format N0:
\- Flag for format N0/format N1 differentiation -- 1 bit, where value 0
indicates format N0 and value 1 indicates format N1
\- Subcarrier indication -- 6 bits as defined in clause 16.5.1.1 of [3]
\- Resource assignment -- 3 bits as defined in clause 16.5.1.1 of [3]
\- Scheduling delay -- 2 bits as defined in clause 16.5.1 of [3]
\- Modulation and coding scheme -- 4 bits as defined in clause 16.5.1.2 of [3]
\- Redundancy version -- 1 bit as defined in clause 16.5.1.2 of [3]
\- Repetition number -- 3 bits as defined in clause 16.5.1.2 of [3]
\- New data indicator -- 1 bit
\- DCI subframe repetition number -- 2 bits as defined in clause 16.6 in [3]
#### 6.4.3.2 DCI Format N1
DCI format N1 is used for the scheduling of one NPDSCH codeword in one cell
and random access procedure initiated by a NPDCCH order. The DCI corresponding
to a NPDCCH order is carried by NPDCCH.
The following information is transmitted by means of the DCI format N1:
\- Flag for format N0/format N1 differentiation -- 1 bit, where value 0
indicates format N0 and value 1 indicates format N1
\- NPDCCH order indicator -- 1 bit
Format N1 is used for random access procedure initiated by a NPDCCH order only
if NPDCCH order indicator is set to \'1\', format N1 CRC is scrambled with
C-RNTI, and all the remaining fields are set as follows:
\- Starting number of NPRACH repetitions -- 2 bits as defined in clause 16.3.2
of [3]
\- Subcarrier indication of NPRACH -- 6 bits as defined in clause 16.3.2 of
[3]
\- All the remaining bits in format N1 are set to one
Otherwise,
\- Scheduling delay -- 3 bits as defined in clause 16.4.1 of [3]
\- Resource assignment -- 3 bits as defined in clause 16.4.1.3 of [3]
\- Modulation and coding scheme -- 4 bits as defined in clause 16.4.1.5 of [3]
\- Repetition number -- 4 bits as defined in clause 16.4.1.3 of [3]
\- New data indicator -- 1 bit
\- HARQ-ACK resource -- 4 bits as defined in clause 16.4.2 of [3].
\- DCI subframe repetition number -- 2 bits as defined in clause 16.6 in [3]
When the format N1 CRC is scrambled with a RA-RNTI, then the following fields
among the fields above are reserved:
\- New data indicator
\- HARQ-ACK resource
If the number of information bits in format N1 is less than that of format N0,
zeros shall be appended to format N1 until the payload size equals that of
format N0.
#### 6.4.3.3 DCI Format N2
DCI format N2 is used for paging and direct indication.
The following information is transmitted by means of the DCI format N2:
> Flag for paging/direct indication differentiation -- 1 bit, with value 0 for
> direct indication and value 1 for paging
>
> If Flag=0:
\- Direct Indication information -- 8 bits provide direct indication of system
information update and other fields, as defined in [6]
\- Reserved information bits are added until the size is equal to that of
format N2 with Flag=1
If Flag=1:
\- Resource assignment -- 3 bits as defined in clause 16.4.1.3 of [3]
\- Modulation and coding scheme -- 4 bits as defined in clause 16.4.1.5 of [3]
\- Repetition number -- 4 bits as defined in clause 16.4.1.3 of [3]
\- DCI subframe repetition number -- 3 bits as defined in clause 16.6 of [3]
