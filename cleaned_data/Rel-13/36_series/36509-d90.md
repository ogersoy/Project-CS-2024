# Introduction
User Equipment (UE) Test Loop functionality is a mandatory feature to support
E-UTRA / EPC conformance testing. It forms part of the core requirements and
thus has a direct impact on the design of the UE.
The test methods applied in RF Conformance Test Specification TS 36.521-1 [27]
and the test models used in Protocol Conformance Test Specifications TS
36.523-1 [30] and TS 36.523-3 [32] define the corresponding UE Test Loop
functionality. The present specification describes the location of the data
loop in the protocol stack as well as the procedure and specific messages to
activate/deactivate the Test Loop functionality in the UE.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines for User Equipment (UE) in E-UTRA FDD or TDD mode
those special functions and their activation/deactivation methods that are
required in UE for conformance testing purposes.
This document also describes the operation of these special functions for UEs
supporting E-UTRA FDD or TDD mode, when operating in UTRA FDD and TDD mode, in
GSM/GPRS mode, and in CDMA2000 mode.

# 4 UE special conformance test functions
## 4.1 General description
The SS performs activation and deactivation of the conformance test functions
in the UE by sending Security Protected NAS Layer 3 messages. Apart from
sending the appropriate deactivation command to the UE the functions shall be
deactivated by:
switching off the UE; or
by removing the USIM.
The following special UE conformance testing functions can be activated (and
deactivated):
\- UE test loop function;
\- Electrical Man Machine Interface (EMMI).
The following Test Control (TC) procedures are used to control the UE test
loop function:
\- Close UE test loop;
\- Open UE test loop.
No specific TC procedures are associated with EMMI.
# 5 Test Control (TC) protocol procedures and test loop operation
## 5.1 General description
The UE test loop function provides access to isolated functions of the UE via
the radio interface without introducing new physical interfaces just for the
reason of conformance testing.
NOTE 1: It should be emphasised that the UE test loop function only describes
the functional behaviour of the UE with respect to its external interfaces;
physical implementation of the UE test loop function is completely left open
to the manufacturer.
The UE test loop function is activated by transmitting the appropriate TC
message to the UE, see clause 6.
The UE test loop function can be operated in different loopback modes:
\- UE test loop mode A;
\- UE test loop mode B;
\- UE test loop mode C;
\- UE test loop mode D;
\- UE test loop mode E;
\- UE test loop mode F;
\- UE test loop mode G;
\- UE test loop mode H;
\- UE test loop mode I.
UE test loop mode A provides loopback of PDCP SDUs for bi-directional data
radio bearers while UE is operating in E-UTRA or NB-IoT mode. The downlink
PDCP SDUs received by the UE on each bi-directional data radio bearer are
returned on the same radio bearer regardless of the PDCP SDU contents and of
the TFT of the associated EPS bearer context [36].
UE test loop mode B provides loopback of PDCP SDUs (E-UTRA and UTRA), SNDCP
PDUs (GSM/GPRS) and RLP PDUs (CDMA2000) for bi-directional EPS bearers while
UE is operated in E-UTRA, NB-IoT, UTRA, GSM/GPRS or CDMA2000 modes. When
operating in E-UTRA, NB-IoT, UTRA or GSM/GPRS then the downlink PDCP SDUs or
SNDCP PDUs received by the UE on all bi-directional data radio bearers are
returned by the UE on the data radio bearer associated with an EPS bearer
context with a TFT matching the TCP/UDP/IP protocol information within the
PDCP SDU or SNDCP SDU [36]. When operating in CDMA2000 modes, the downlink RLP
PDUs received by the UE on all bi-directional data radio bearers are returned
by the UE on the data radio bearer with the smallest identity, regardless of
the RLP PDU content and of the TFT of the associated EPS bearer context.
NOTE 2: When multiple PDN connections are established (or multiple Primary PDP
Contexts are active), it is assumed that different IP addresses are allocated
to the UE by the SS on each PDN.
UE test loop mode C provides counting of successfully received MBMS Packets on
a given MTCH while UE is operating in E-MBMS/E-UTRA mode. For E-MBMS then one
or more MTCHs are multiplexed on a MCH. MBMS packets for a MTCH are delivered
as one RLC SDU per MBMS packet segmented into one or more RLC UMD PDUs.
UE test loop mode D provides means for announcing or monitoring of ProSe
Direct Discovery messages on SL-DCH, as specified by the test loop mode D
setup IE in the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message. In particular, for discovery
monitor operation, UE test loop mode D provides counting of successfully
received SL-DCH MAC SDUs while the UE is operating in ProSe Direct
Discovery/E-UTRA mode. For discovery announce operation, UE test loop mode D
provides trigger for transmission of ProSe Direct Discovery message on SL-DCH.
NOTE 3: UE test loop mode D is intended for RF/RRM testing purposes.
NOTE 4: ProSe Direct Discovery messages on the PC5 interface are delivered as
one MAC SDU per ProSe Direct Discovery message.
UE test loop mode E provides means for either transmit or receive of ProSe
Direct Communication packets, as specified by the test loop mode E setup IE in
the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message. In particular, for communication receive
operation, UE test loop mode E provides counting of successfully received STCH
PDCP SDUs and PSCCH transport blocks while the UE is operating in ProSe Direct
Communication/E-UTRA mode. For communication transmit operation, UE test loop
mode E provides trigger for transmission of IP packets for ProSe Direct
Communication message on STCH.
NOTE 5: UE test loop mode E is intended for RF/RRM testing and partially for
Protocol testing - for Protocol testing it is used only in the case of
Reception of communication data.
NOTE 6: The Application trigger required to force the UE to start or stop a
particular ProSe Service is out of the scope of the test loop modes D and E.
UE test loop mode F provides counting of successfully received MBMS Packets on
a given SC-MTCH while UE is operating in SC-PTM/E-UTRA mode. For SC-PTM one
SC-MTCH is transmitted on a DL-SCH. MBMS packets for a SC-MTCH are delivered
as one RLC SDU per MBMS packet segmented into one or more RLC UMD PDUs.
UE test loop mode G provides loopback of the User data container content of
any received downlink ESM DATA TRANSPORT message in uplink. The received data
can be configured to be either returned via the UE EMM entity (before the UE
uplink rate control entity) or as a RLC SDU to the SRB RLC entity (SRB1bis for
NB-IoT UE or to SRB2 for E-UTRA UE). UE test loop mode G may be configured to
delay the uplink loopback of user data. UE test loop mode G may also be
configured to repeat the received user data of the User data container in
uplink to generate higher data rates in uplink.
UE test loop mode H provides loopback of the TP-User-Data field (including the
SMS user data) of any received downlink TPDU (SMS-DELIVER) in uplink. The
received data can be configured to be either returned via the UE SM-TL entity
or as a RLC SDU to the SRB RLC entity (SRB1bis for NB-IoT UE or to SRB2 for
E-UTRA UE). UE test loop mode H may be configured to delay the uplink loopback
of SMS user data. UE test loop mode H may also be configured to repeat the
received SMS user data in uplink to generate higher data rates in uplink.
NOTE 7: UE test loop mode G and H are intended for control plane data testing
for UEs supporting EPS services with Control Plane CIoT EPS optimization.
NOTE 8: The delay timer for UE test loop mode G and H is triggered by the
first reception of user data after the reception of a CLOSE UE TEST LOOP TC
message. While the delay timer is running only the user data received in the
latest ESM DATA TRANSPORT or SMS message is buffered.
NOTE 9: The repetition of uplink transmission of uplink messages carrying data
can be configured as 0 (no data returned), 1 (the same content and size of
user date as received in downlink is returned) or value N > 1 (user data
corresponding to N times repetition of the received user data is returned in
uplink).
UE test loop mode I provides loopback of the IP PDUs received in User data
container content of downlink ESM DATA TRANSPORT message in uplink via the UE
uplink TFT hander and the UE EMM entity (before the UE uplink rate control
entity).
NOTE 10: UE test loop mode I is intended for control plane data testing for
UEs supporting EPS services with Control Plane CIoT EPS optimization.
UE test loop mode A is mandatory to all E-UTRA UEs and all NB-IoT UEs
supporting user plane data transfer.

optimization and control plane data transfer using SMS.
UE test loop mode I is mandatory for UEs supporting Control Plane CIoT EPS
optimization and control plane data transfer using the ESM DATA TRANSFER
procedure.
Support of UPDATE UE LOCATION INFORMATION is optional for all E-UTRA UEs with
the exception of E-UTRA UEs supporting ProSe Direct Communication for which it
is mandatory.
For E-UTRA UE supporting multiple radio access technologies then UE reception
of Test Control messages is limited to UE operating in E-UTRA mode, while
continuation of loopback of user data is provided over the change to other UE
supported radio access technologies.
UE test loop mode B for operation in UTRA, GSM/GPRS and CDMA2000 mode is only
applicable for loopback of user data in PS domain.
The TC entity may be seen as a L3 or a NAS entity.

## 5.2 Security protection of test control messages
The test control messages, i.e. ACTIVATE TEST MODE, DEACTIVATE TEST MODE,
CLOSE UE TEST LOOP, and OPEN UE TEST LOOP, are integrity protected and
ciphered according to TS 24.301 clause 4.4.
## 5.3 UE test mode procedures
### 5.3.1 General
The UE test mode procedures are intended for setting the UE into a test mode
where the SS can set up data radio bearers (UE test loop mode A) or EPS
bearers (UE test loop mode B) or MTCH data radio bearers (UE test loop mode C)
or SL-DCH (UE test loop mode D) or STCH and PSCCH (UE test loop mode E) or SC-
MTCH (UE test loop mode F) to be terminated in the UE test loop function; as
well as, for making UE leave the test mode if it has previously been set into
it and return to normal operation.
### 5.3.2 Activate UE test mode
Figure 5.3.2-1: Activate UE test mode procedure
#### 5.3.2.1 General
The SS uses the activate UE test mode procedure to get the UE into a test mode
where the SS can set up one or more sets of data radio bearers with an
associated EPS bearer context (UE test loop mode A) or EPS bearers (UE test
loop mode B) or MTCH data radio bearers (UE test loop mode C) or SC-MTCH data
radio bearers (UE test loop mode F) before commanding the UE to terminate them
in the UE test loop function. The SS also uses the activate UE test mode
procedure to get the UE into a test mode where SS can perform control plane
data testing (UE test loop mode G and H). The activation of the UE test loop
function in UE test loop mode A, UE test loop mode B, UE Test loop mode C, UE
test loop mode D, or UE test loop mode E, or UE test loop mode F will control
if the UE is terminating the data radio bearers, the EPS bearers or the MTCH
data radio bearer or the SL-DCH or the STCH/PSCCH or the SC-MTCH in the UE
test loop function. The activation of the UE test loop function in UE test
loop mode G will control if the EMM entity of the UE is terminating User data
container content received in ESM DATA TRANSPORT messages in the UE test loop
function. The activation of the UE test loop function in UE test loop mode H
will control if the SM-TL entity of the UE is terminating TP-User-Data fields
received in TPDUs in the UE test loop function. The activation of the UE test
loop function in UE test loop mode I will control if the ESM entity of the UE
is terminating User data container content received in ESM DATA TRANSPORT
messages in the UE test loop function.
#### 5.3.2.2 Initiation
The SS can activate the UE test mode when UE is in E-UTRA or NB-IoT connected
state.
NOTE: Refer to TS 36.508 [28] subclause 4.5.1 for more details on UE states.
The SS requests the UE to activate the UE test mode by transmitting an
ACTIVATE TEST MODE message.
#### 5.3.2.3 Reception of ACTIVATE TEST MODE message by UE
Upon receiving the ACTIVATE TEST MODE message the UE shall:
1> if the UE test loop mode parameter in the ACTIVATE TEST MODE message is
different from UE test loop mode G and different from UE test loop mode H and
a default EPS bearer context is already activated:
2> the UE behaviour is unspecified.
  1. else:
2> activate the UE test mode;
2> send ACTIVATE TEST MODE COMPLETE message.
When the UE test mode is active, the UE operates normally, except for the
following:
1> the UE shall accept any request to establish a data radio bearer with an
associated EPS bearer context, both included in the same RRC message, and
within the radio access capabilities of the UE;
1> optionally, if the UE supports CSG Proximity Indication;
2> the UE shall ignore any non 3GPP radio signals which are normally used in
determining proximity to a CSG (closed subscriber group) cell and delete any
previously stored cell information for proximity detection.
NOTE 1: The UE may provide other means which would guarantee that the UE
ignores any non 3GPP radio signals which are normally used in determining
proximity to a CSG (closed subscriber group) cell and deletes any previously
stored cell information for proximity detection. For such UEs the above
mentioned CSG requirements in UE test mode may not apply.
1> if neither test loop mode A operation, test loop mode B operation, test
loop mode C operation, test loop mode D operation, test loop mode E, test loop
mode F, test loop mode G, test loop mode H operation, nor test loop mode I
operation is ongoing:
2> if the UE is operating in E-UTRAN or NB-IoT mode, for each PDN connection
requested by the UE:
3> if the UE has not received the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message in response to the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message; or
3> if the UE has received the response message with the PDN type IE set to
\'IPv4\' and an IPv4 address value different from \'0.0.0.0\' and \"IPv4
address allocation via DHCPv4\" was not requested by the UE:
4> the UE shall not transmit any uplink PDCP SDU on any DRB associated with
the requested PDN:
4> the UE may discard any received downlink PDCP SDU on any DRB associated
with the requested PDN.
NOTE 2: If the UE has requested the use of DHCPv4 signalling for allocation of
an IPv4 address, the UE may either accept the IPv4 address provided via NAS
signalling and not transmit any uplink PDCP SDU on any DRB and may discard
downlink PDCP SDUs on any DRB, or the UE may transmit and receive DHCPv4
messages to obtain an IPv4 address, according to the procedure described in TS
36.508 clause 4.5.2A.
3> if the UE has received the response message with the PDN type IE set to
'IPv6' or 'IPv4v6' or \"IPv4 address allocation via DHCPv4\" was requested by
the UE , and the UE has not yet obtained its IP address(es);
4> the UE may transmit uplink PDCP SDUs on any DRB associated with the
requested PDN, for the sole purpose of obtaining its IP address(es).
3> if the UE has obtained its IP address(es):
4> the UE shall not transmit any uplink PDCP SDU on any DRB associated with
the requested PDN:
4> the UE may discard any received downlink PDCP SDU on any DRB associated
with the requested PDN.
### 5.3.3 Deactivate UE test mode
Figure 5.3.3-1: Deactivate UE test mode procedure
#### 5.3.3.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to deactivate the UE test mode and return UE
to normal operation.
NOTE: Deactivation of the UE test loop mode may occur as well as a result of
other events. For further details see e.g. 4.1, 5.4.2.1.
#### 5.3.3.2 Initiation
The SS can deactivate the UE test mode when UE is in E-UTRA or NB-IoT
connected state and the UE test mode is active.
NOTE: Refer to TS 36.508 [28] subclause 4.5.1 for more details on UE states.
The SS requests the UE to deactivate the UE test mode by transmitting a
DEACTIVATE TEST MODE message.
#### 5.3.3.3 Reception of DEACTIVATE TEST MODE message by UE
Upon receiving the DEACTIVATE TEST MODE message the UE shall:
1> deactivate the UE test mode;
1> send a DEACTIVATE TEST MODE COMPLETE message.
## 5.4 UE test loop procedures
### 5.4.1 General
The UE test loop function is intended for:
\- E-UTRA RF receiver and transmitter testing to generate data transfer in
downlink and uplink.
\- E-UTRA layer 2 (MAC, RLC, PDCP) and data radio bearer testing to generate
data transfer in downlink and uplink.
\- EPC and E-UTRA layer 3 testing to verify data transfer continuation over
RRC and EPC procedures.
\- EPC NAS user-plane testing to verify uplink TFT handling.
\- E-UTRA/EPC Inter-system testing to verify data transfer continuation over
Inter-system change procedures to and from UTRA, GSM/GPRS and CDMA2000.
\- E-UTRA/E-MBMS MCH performance testing.
\- E-UTRA/E-MBMS layer 2 (MAC, RLC) and MTCH data radio bearer testing.

### 5.4.2 Close UE test loop
{width="3.7402777777777776in" height="1.6465277777777778in"}
Figure 5.4.2-1: Close UE test loop procedure
#### 5.4.2.1 General
The SS uses the close UE test loop procedure to start the UE Test Loop
function in the UE while in E-UTRA or NB-IoT mode.
A prerequisite for UE test loop mode A is that at least one bi-directional
data radio bearer has been established between SS and UE.
A prerequisite for UE test loop mode B is that at least one EPS bearer context
has been established between SS and UE.
A prerequisite for UE test loop mode C is that at least one MTCH data radio
bearer has been established between SS and UE.
A prerequisite for UE test loop mode D is that the UE is pre-authorized for
ProSe Direct Discovery operation.
NOTE 1: No radio bearer setup is required to transmit or receive ProSe Direct
Discovery messages.
A prerequisite for UE test loop mode E is that the UE is pre-authorized for
ProSe Direct Communication operation and pre-configured parameters are
provided in the USIM.
NOTE 2: Explicit signalling for sidelink radio bearer (SLRB) is not required
to transmit or receive STCH for ProSe Direct Communication.
A prerequisite for UE test loop mode F is that at least one SC-MTCH data radio
bearer has been established between SS and UE.
The UE shall provide for normal layer 1, layer 2, RRC, EMM and ESM
functionality while the UE test loop function is active. This includes (but is
not limited to) handover procedures and normal disconnection of the data radio
bearer.
For UE test loop mode A the loopback shall be maintained across handovers
within E-UTRA and NB-IoT, but after data radio bearer release, the loopback
shall cease to exist.
For UE test loop mode G and UE test loop mode H the loopback shall be
maintained across handovers and cell re-selections within its RAT (e.g. within
E-UTRA at handovers and re-selections for E-UTRA UE and between NB-IoT cells
at cell re-selections for NB-IoT UE).
For UE test loop mode B the loopback shall be maintained across handovers
within E-UTRA and between radio access system (E-UTRA to/from UTRA, E-UTRA
to/from GSM/GPRS and E-UTRA to/from CDMA2000). This means that any buffered IP
PDUs in the UE test loop function at the time of the intra- or inter-system
change shall be kept in the UE test loop function and being scheduled for
transmission transparently to the intra- or inter-system change.
For UE test loop mode A or B the UE shall not transmit any uplink U-plane data
other than the data returned by the loopback entity.
For UE test loop mode G or I the UE shall not transmit any uplink ESM DATA
TRANSPORT other than the ones initiated by the loopback entity.
For UE test loop mode D and E, the UE (and not the test loop) shall provide
full normal ProSe functionality as specified in TS 24.334 [38] and TS 36.331
[25] e.g. ProSe synchronization signals transmission and/or reception as
configured by RRC, while the UE test loop is active.
#### 5.4.2.1a UE test loop mode A PDCP SDU and UE test loop mode B IP PDU
buffer size requirement
The minimum UE loopback buffer size for PDCP SDUs (UE test loop mode A) and IP
PDUs (UE test loop mode B), when UE is operated in RLC AM or UM mode, shall be
according to table 5.4.2.1a-1. The UE behaviour, when the loopback buffer
capacity is exceeded, is unspecified.

data container size and TP-User-Data buffer size requirements
The minimum UE loopback buffer size for user data for UE test loop mode G and
UE test loop mode H shall be according to table 5.4.2.1b-1. The UE behaviour,
when the loopback buffer capacity is exceeded, is unspecified.
The minimum User data container for UE test loop mode G and TP-User-Data

PSCCH transport blocks while UE test loop mode E is activated and
TEST_LOOP_MODE_E_TRIGGER is set to RECEIVE. The counter variable is indexed
with SL_ID = 0...( MAX_ModeE_Monitor_Entities). PSCCH_PACKET_COUNTER(SL_ID)
shall be set to zero when UE is switched on. If configured value of variable
PROSE_COMMUNICATION_MONITOR_N is set to 0 then UE counts all PSCCH PHY
transport blocks as part of one counter PSCCH_PACKET_COUNTER(0) irrespective
of Group Destination IDs.
TEST_LOOP_MODE_F_ACTIVE
This boolean state variable is used to indicate if UE test loop mode F is
active. TEST_LOOP_MODE_F_ACTIVE shall be set to FALSE when UE is switched on.
SCPTM_PACKET_COUNTER
This 32-bit integer state variable is used to count successful reception of
MBMS packets while UE test loop mode F is activate. SCPTM_PACKET_COUNTER shall
be set to zero when UE is switched on.
TEST_LOOP_MODE_G_ACTIVE
This boolean state variable is used to indicate if UE test loop mode G is
active. TEST_LOOP_MODE_G_ACTIVE shall be set to FALSE when UE is switched on.
TEST_LOOP_MODE_H_ACTIVE
This boolean state variable is used to indicate if UE test loop mode H is
active. TEST_LOOP_MODE_H_ACTIVE shall be set to FALSE when UE is switched on.
GH_BUFFER_CP_data
This boolean state variable is used when UE test loop mode G or UE test loop
mode H is active to control if UE is to buffer the user data received in
downlink or not.
GH_RLC_SDU_loopback
This boolean state variable is used when UE test loop mode G or UE test loop
mode H is active to control if UE is to return data as RLC SDUs. If the value
is TRUE then data is returned as RLC SDUs for both UE Test loop mode G and H.
If the value is FALSE then data is returned to the EMM entity for UE test loop
mode G and to the SM-TL entity for UE test loop mode H.
## 7.2 Constants
MAX_ModeA_LB_entities = 8.
MAX_ModeD_Monitor_Entities = 400.
MAX_ModeE_Monitor_Entities = 16.
## 7.3 Timers
T_delay_modeB
When UE is operated in E-UTRA, NB-IoT, UTRA and GERA mode, this timer is used
to delay the transmission of the first IP PDU when UE test loop function is
operated in UE test loop mode B. In CDMA2000, this timer is used to
temporarily interrupt UE test loop mode B operation so as to allow IP control
signalling required before data transmission. The timer value is configured by
the UE test loop mode B setup IE in the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message.
T_delay_modeGH
When UE test loop function is operated in UE test loop mode G or UE test loop
mode H this timer is used to delay the transmission of uplink user data. The
timer value is configured by the UE test loop mode GH setup IE in the CLOSE UE
TEST LOOP message.
## 7.4 Configurable parameters
DRB_ID(LB_ID)
This parameter is used by the UE when operating in UE test loop mode A to map
a bi-directional Data Radio bearer to a loopback entity. LB_ID = 0..
(MAX_ModeA_LB_entities-1). The value is configured when UE receives the CLOSE
UE TEST LOOP message DRB_ID(LB_ID)=0 indicate that no DRB is mapped to the
loopback identity.
UL_PDCP_SDU_scaling(LB_ID)
This parameter is used to enable/disable scaling of UL PDCP SDU size. If
UL_PDCP_SDU_scaling is set to TRUE then scaling based on
UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID) parameter is performed, otherwise no scaling is done
(UL PDCP SDU size is equal to received DL PDCP SDU size). The value is
configured by the UE test loop mode A setup IE in the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP
message.
UL_PDCP_SDU_size(LB_ID)
This parameter is used to set the UL PDCP SDU size for returned UL PDCP SDUs
on the data radio bearer with data radio bearer ID equal to DRB_ID(LB_ID).
This parameter is only applicable for UE test loop mode A and when state
variable UL_PDCP_SDU_scaling(LB_ID) is TRUE. The value is configured by the UE
test loop mode A setup IE in the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message.
PROSE_DISCOVERY_APPCODE(SL_ID)
This parameter is used by the UE when operating in UE test loop mode D and
TEST_LOOP_MODE_D_TRIGGER is set to MONITOR to map the LSBs of the ProSe App
Code to monitor to the entity index SL_ID = 0...(
MAX_ModeD_Monitor_Entities-1). The value is configured in the CLOSE UE TEST
LOOP message.
PROSE_COMMUNICATION_DEST_ID(SL_ID)
This parameter is used by the UE when operating in UE test loop mode E and
TEST_LOOP_MODE_E_TRIGGER is set to RECEIVE to map the Group Destination ID to
monitor to the entity index SL_ID = 0...( MAX_ModeE_Monitor_Entities-1). The
value is configured in the CLOSE UE TEST LOOP message.
GH_NUMBER_UL_DATA_REPETITIONS
This parameter is used by the UE when operating in UE test loop mode G or UE
test loop mode H to repeat user data received in downlink
GH_NUMBER_UL_DATA_REPETITIONS of times in uplink. The parameter is configured
by UE test loop mode GH IE in CLOSE UE TEST LOOP.
# 8 Electrical Man Machine Interface (EMMI)
The EMMI is used for automation of conformance testing. The commands used on
the EMMI by the System Simulator, shall be limited to those specified in TS
36.523-3 [32]. An illustration is given in figure 8-1 as an example.
At the System Simulator side, the logical EMMI using mandatory AT commands
shall interface with the Main Test Component (MTC) of TTCN test cases which
hosts the Upper Tester. The physical EMMI interface towards the UE may be for
example a standard USB interface. Other interfaces of proprietary or
standardized type shall not be precluded.
At the UE side an adapter needs to be provided by the UE manufacturer for
converting the commands into the UE manufacturer specific interface and
format.
The use of EMMI is optional for the UE.
