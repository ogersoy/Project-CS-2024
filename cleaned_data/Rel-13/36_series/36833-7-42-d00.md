# 4 Background
The 3.5GHz band has been widely recognized as the most probable global
harmonized TDD band and will play an important role in meeting the explosive
mobile data demands. Regional band planning or re-farming considerations for
this band have made significant progress in the world in recent years,
Carrier aggregation up in this band have been a successful mechanism to
provide additional bandwidth and corresponding requirements has been captured
in [3, 4] for 2-CC CA and 3-CC CA respectively. However, there are still
market requirements on even higher bandwidth since operators in some countries
can get large spectrum up to 80MHz.
Consequently, a new WID proposal on "LTE Advanced intra-band contiguous
Carrier Aggregation in Band 42 for 4DL" was approved in RAN#67 [2]. The
objectives of this WI are as follows,
\- Specify the RF requirements for Band 42 intra-band contiguous CA supporting
up to 4CC in downlink.
\- Define channel bandwidth combinations for carrier aggregation in 65MHz,
70MHz, 75MHz and 80MHz contiguous spectrum.
\- Add the performance requirements for this band in the relevant
specifications.
# 5 Study of E-UTRA requirements
## 5.1 Operating bands and channel bandwidths
Table 5.1-1 defines the supported E-UTRA CA configurations and bandwidth
combination set for LTE-advanced intra-band contiguous CA in Band 42. The
5MHz, 10MHz and 15MHz carriers are only allowed at the edges of aggregated
channel bandwidth so that potential co-existence issue with adjacent systems
can be handled with some flexibility.

## 5.2 Specific UE RF requirements
### 5.2.1 Reference sensitivity power level
In general, TDD intra-band carrier aggregation does not change the UE
reference sensitivity requirement as it does not introduce any impact to the
UE front end RF architecture. Further the REFSENS requirement for intra-band
contiguous carrier aggregation is measured on a per CC basis and the same
reference sensitivity level as that for single CC is reused on a per CC basis.
Hence the introduction of CA_42E with 4 downlink CCs and maximum 2 uplink CCs
does not impact the current REFENS requirement.
### 5.2.2 Maximum input level
The maximum input level for CA_42E is defined to keep the total input power
level as for 3DL case. So the total maximum input level for CA_42E UE should
be -20.2dBm (64QAM) for 64QAM input signal and -22.2dBm for 256QAM input
signal respectively.

### 5.2.3 Adjacent channel selectivity
To account for the added difficulty of the baseband filter impact, the ACS
requirements are scaled for the number of aggregated component carriers. The
ACS requirements for CA_42E UE is defined as 21dB as shown in Table 5.2.3-1.
Corresponding power settings for the ACS requirements are shown in Table
5.2.3-2 and Table 5.2.3-3.

### 5.2.4 Blocking characteristics
#### 5.2.4.1 In-band blocking
To account for the added difficulty of the baseband filter impact, the in-band
requirement is scaled for the number of aggregated component carriers. The
wanted signal level per CC for CA_42E UE is defined as REFSENS+15dBm as shown
in Table 5.2.4.1-1 and CA configuration is listed in Table 5.2.4.1-2.

There is no aggregated bandwidth dependency for out-of-band blocking
requirement. The same requirement is reused for CA_42E with no changes from

### 5.2.6 Intermodulation characteristics
When the aggregated bandwidth is wider, the intermodulation requirements need
to account for the added difficulty of the baseband filter impact. The wanted
signal power per CC is scaled as REFSENS+15dB for CA_42E.

### 5.2.7 Receiver image
There is no aggregated bandwidth dependency for Rx image requirement. It is
proposed to reuse Rx Image requirements for CA_42E with no changes from Class
B/C/D.

## 5.3 Specific BS RF requirements
For BS capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation in contiguous spectrum in
single band, the RF requirements currently specified in the BS specifications
36.104 are agnostic to the number of carriers supported by the BS in intra-
band contiguous CA operation.
The test configuration and test requirements in the BS test specification
36.141 are also defined in a generic way. The test configuration only gives a
principle on how to create test signals depending on manufacturer's
declaration on number of carriers and other parameters so that a multi-carrier
and/or CA BS can be well verified.
Therefore, the current BS RF requirements are applicable for 4-CC contiguous
intra-band DL CA in Band 42, and no change in the BS specifications is
required.
## 5.4 Specific RRM requirements
The RRM requirements for carrier aggregations, as specified in the
specification TS 36.133, need to be updated to support CA operation up to 4
carriers.
