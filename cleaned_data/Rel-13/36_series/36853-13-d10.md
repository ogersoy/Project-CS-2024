# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 3DL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-13 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS side. The
document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination)
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
present document, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the
rapporteur of each WI to ensure that the TPs related to the WI have been
implemented.
# 5 Single UL: General Part

### 6.1.3 Harmonics IMD study
#### 6.1.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products generated by BS transmitting 3DL CA at Band 3,
Band 3 and Band 8 DL carriers are shown in Table 6.1.3.1-1 below.

* * *
As shown in Table 6.1.3.1-1, in addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD
product from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ intermodulation
products generated by BS supporting 3DL CA of Band (3+3+8) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 8, 20 or 41. As 3^rd^ intermodulation products may
fall into own receive block of Band 8, further analysis is needed to be done.
Assume that the 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (3 + 3 + 8) BS are a, b,
and c MHz in channel bandwidth and d, e, and f MHz from the lower edges of
Band 3 and 8 DL frequency as shown in Figure 6.1.3.1-1 below:
Figure 6.1.3.1-1: 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (3 + 3 + 8) BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.1.3.1-2
below:
Figure 6.1.3.1-2: 3 carriers received by the Band (3 + 3 + 8) BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.1.3.1-2 below:
Table 6.1.3.1-2: Band (3 + 3 + 8) BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
3^rd^ order IMD products IMD frequency limits (MHz) (f1-low + f2-low --
f3-high) 925 + _d_ \+ _e_ \-- _f_ \-- _c_ (f1-high + f2-high -- f3-low) 925 +
_d_ \+ _a_ \+ _e_ \+ _b_ \-- _f_ (f1-low + f3-low -- f2-high) 925 + _d_ \+ _f_
\-- _e_ \-- _b_ (f1-high + f3-high -- f2-low) 925 + _d_ \+ _a_ \+ _f_ \+ _c_
\-- _e_
* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.1.3.1-2 with the BS receive
blocks in Figure 6.1.3.1-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD
products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC will only fall into the
BS own receive block of Band 8 under one of the transmit configurations shown
in Table 6.1.3.1-3 below:

For the REFSENS of Band 7 and Band 40 for 1UL/3DL CA_7A-40C, the requirements
are specified in the following section.
### 6.8.5 MSD
For Band 7 and Band 40 combination with 1UL and 3DL, the MSD problem shall be
considered due to insufficient cross-band isolation. One is degradation of
Band 40 DL from Band 7 UL, and the other is degradation of Band 7 DL from Band
40 UL. The MSD requirements are specified in Tables 6.8.5-1 and 6.8.5-2. For
the final MSD, the averaged MSD is derived from [R4-155308] and [R4-155381].
For these MSD, 10 dB antenna isolation is used for calculation.

### 6.9.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.9.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
7 and Band 28 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.9.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.9.3.1-1: Band 1, Band 7 and Band 28 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f1-low f1-high f2-low f2-high f3-low f3-high DL frequency (MHz)
758 803 2110 2170 2620 2690  
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1_high+f2_high-f3_low) (f1_low+f2_low-f3_high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 178 353  
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1_low-f2_high+f3_low) (f1_high-f2_low+f3_high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 1208 1383  
3^rd^ order IMD products (-f1_high+f2_low+f3_low) (-f1_low+f2_high+f3_high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 3927 4102  
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f2-low + f3-low) (f1-high + f2-high +
f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 5488 5663
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.9.3.1-1 that none of the 3^rd^ order IMD products
caused by Band 1, Band 7 and Band 28 DL may fall into any E-UTRA BS receiving
band. Hence we can conclude that there is no issue on DL 3^rd^ order IMD
interference.
#### 6.9.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.9.3.2-1 provides the harmonic products for CA_1A-7A-28AC with 1 UL. It
can be found that the 3^rd^ order harmonics of Band 28 fall into the receiver
band of Band 1. It was already identified in previous work and specified in TR
36.851. Except 3^rd^ order harmonics of Band 28, none of the products falls
into the B1, B7 or B28 UE receiving bands.

3*fz_high 2109 to 2244
* * *
### 6.9.4 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the Î”T~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.9.4-1.
Table 6.9.4-1: Î”T~IB,c~ for 3DL aggregation

Inter-band CA Configuration E-UTRA Band Î”T~IB,c~ Inter-band with one active UL
serving cell [dB] CA_1A-7A-28A 1 0.5 7 0.6 28 0.6
* * *
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configuration in
Table 6.9.4-2 with uplink in one E-UTRA band, the minimum requirement for
reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.1-1 [TS 36.101] shall be increased by the
amount given in Î”R~IB,c~ in Table 6.9.4-2 for the applicable E-UTRA bands.
~Table\ 6.9.4-2:\ Î”RIB,c\ for\ 3DL\ aggregation~

* * *
There is a harmonic relation between the Band 28 UL band and the Band 1 DL
band. The 3^rd^ order harmonics of Band 28 fall into Band 1 DL frequency
range. Exceptions are allowed and already specified for the fallback mode
CA_1A-28A. Therefore the exceptions for CA_1A-7A-28A can follow CA_1A-28A and
are given in Table 6.9.4-3 and Table 6.9.4-4.

### 6.10.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.10.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
3 and Band 7 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each band)
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.10.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.10.3.1-1: Band 1, Band 3 and Band 7 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 6535 6740
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.10.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 3 + 7) may fall into
the BS receive band of Band 11, 30 and Band 40. Band 11 and Band 30 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as (1 + 3 \+ 7). Therefore, the
focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 40.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 40 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Band (1 + 3 + 7) BS transmitter does not share
the same antenna with Band 40 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (1 + 3 + 7) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 40 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 40 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.10.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.10.3.2-1 provides the harmonic products for CA_1A-3A-7A with 1 UL. It
can be found that none of the harmonics products falls into the B1, B3 or B7
UE receiving bands.

### 6.10.4 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_1A-3A-7A with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band
the Î”T~IB,c~ is defined for applicable bands in Table 6.10.4-1.

For the UE which supports CA_1A-3A-7A with uplink in one E-UTRA band, the
minimum requirement for reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.1-1 [2] shall be
increased by the amount given in Î”R~IB,c~ in Table 6.10.4-2 for the applicable
E-UTRA bands.

### 6.10.5 MSD
For this combination, it may cause MSD when band 1 uplink is close to band 3
DL. For the constituent 2DL CA_1A-3A, Band 3 MSD is specified when the
separation between the lower edge of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the
upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is less than 60 MHz. For this 3DL
combination, it is reasonable to specify the same MSD requirements as CA_1A-3A
since no additional challenges are required. Therefore the reference
sensitivity exception for CA_1A-3A-7A can be specified in the following.

### 6.15.3 Co-existence studies for 3DL/1UL
Table 6.15.3-1 and Table 6.15.3-2 shows harmonics frequency limits and
intermodulation products frequency limits for CA of Band 7, Band 7 and Band
28, respectively. Harmonics and intermodulation product problems are
summarized below the relevant table.

Band 28

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 2274 to 2409 7860 to 8070

As shown in Table 6.15.3-2, second and third harmonics will not fall to any UL
frequencies for Bands specified in 3GPP specifications, besides band 30 and
band 40 which is impacted by 3^rd^ harmonics from band 28. Band 30 is not
intended for deployment in the same geographical area as Band 7+Band 28. Band
40 is 2300-2400MHz while Band 28 is below 1GHz. The same antenna is not
expected to be used and thus no problem exists.

* * *
As shown in Table 6.15.3-2, second order intermodulation products may fall to
UL frequencies of Band 1,2, 22, 25, 33, 35-37, 39 and 42. However bands 25 and
39 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as bands 7 and 28.
Bands 35-37 are currently not under deployment. Therefore, the focus is on the
2^nd^ order IMD falling into bands 1, 2, 22, 33 and 42.
Third intermodulation products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 5, 6, 12-14,
17-20, 26-28, 38, 41 and 44. Note that the calculation in Table 6.15.3-2
(except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 70 MHz DL
frequency of Band 7 and the whole 45 MHz DL frequency of Band 28. If the BS is
only transmitting up to 40 MHz aggregated bandwidth in the DL of Band 7 and an
up to 20 MHz DL in Band 28 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products
may only fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 13, 14, 18-20,
26-28, 38, 41 and 44 as shown in the last row in Table 6.15.3-2. However bands
6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 41 and 44 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as bands 7 and 28. Therefore, the focus is on the 3^rd^ order IMD falling
into bands 5, 20, 26, 27, 28 and 38.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 7, Band 7 and Band 28
should not share the same antenna with Band 1, 2, 5, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 33,
38 and 42 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very stringent second and
third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Bands 1, 2, 5,
20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 33, 38 and 42 receiver desensitization. It is also
suggested to use separate antennas for Band 28 receiver and Band 7+Band 7+Band
28 transmission.
### 6.15.4 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with

### 6.16.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.16.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band
7 and Band 8 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each band)
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.16.3.1-1 below:

IMD frequency limits (MHz) 5350 5530
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.16.3.1-1, that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 7 + 8) may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9, 10, 22, 42 and 43.However bands 4, 9 and
10 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as bands 3 and 7 and
8. Therefore, the focus is on the 3^rd^ order IMD falling into bands 3, 22, 42
and 43. Band 22, 42 and 43 are bands at 3.5GHZ and is not expected that they
will share antennas with BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 3, Band 7 and
Band 8. In addition, It is also suggested that BS transmitters supporting CA
of Band 3, Band 7 and Band 8 should not share the same antenna with Band 3 BS
receiver, unless the antenna path meets very stringent second and third order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 3 receiver
desensitization.
#### 6.16.3.2 For the UE
For single UL the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic analysis for B3 and B8 is done in
the 2DL/1UL TR 36.850, and the analysis for B7 and B8 is done in the 2DL/1UL
TR 36.851. For UE coexistence the single UL is already considered for these
bands in TS 36.101 [2].
As shown in Table 6.16.3.2-1, it can been seen that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order
harmonics of Band 8 will fall into Band 3 and Band 7 DL respectively, 2^nd^
harmonics of Band 8 fall into Band 3 for 902-915 MHz and 3^rd^ harmonics of
Band 8 fall into Band 7 for 880-896 MHz. Note that for channels of Band 8
overlapping the range 896-902 MHz, desensitization may occur in both Band 3
and Band 7 DL simultaneously.

There is a harmonic relation between the Band 8 UL band and the Band 3 DL and
Band 7 DL bands. Looking at the frequency ranges of the bands, 2^nd^ harmonics
of Band 8 fall into Band 3 for 902-915 MHz and 3^rd^ harmonics into Band 7 for
880-896 MHz. This does not account for the fact that desensitization can occur
when the harmonics falls just outside the bandwidth of the victim channel in
the high bands. The frequency ranges of Band 8 UL operation for which
harmonics may be significant in the high bands may therefore be wider.
Exceptions are allowed and already specified for the fallback mode CA_7A-8A,
whereas no requirements apply when harmonics fall into Band 3 DL for the
CA_3A-8A configuration. The exceptions for CA_3A-7A-8A therefore follow from
CA_7A-8A and are given in Table 6.16.4-3 and Table 6.16.4-4.

### 6.17.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.17.3.1 For the BS
Table 6.17.3.1-1 gives the harmonics and IMD products for Band 1 + Band 3 +
Band 3 CA with 3DL. It shows that the second harmonics may fall into BS
receive band of Band 43, and no third harmonics will fall into any BS receive
band specified by 3GPP. In addition, no second order intermodulation products
will fall into any BS receive band. The third order intermodulation products
may fall into the BS receive band of Band 2, 7, 11, 21, 24, 25, 35, 39, 40 and
41.
Note that Band 2, 25 and 35 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Band 1 and Band 3. It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of
Band 1 + Band 3 +Band3 should not share the same antenna with Band 7, 11, 21,
24, 39, 40, 41 and 43 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very
stringent third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 7,
11, 21, 24, 33, 39, 40, 41 and 43 BS receiver desensitization. Specific
analysis on the harmonics and IMD products with consideration on the adopted
bandwidth and the carrier places are needed if considering the shared antenna.

#### 6.17.3.2 For the UE
As shown in Table 6.17.3.2-1, the harmonic frequencies of band 1 and band 3 in
UL are away from the receive bands of B1 and B3 in the DL, so that we can
conclude that there is no issue on UL harmonic interference.

### 6.17.5 MSD
Considered what has been discussed for B1+B3 CA, the CA_B1A_B3C also need to
be separated into two cases when the uplink is configured in Band 1. One is
without MSD issues when the separation between the upper edge of the
aggregated DL continuous carrier in Band 3 and the lower edge of UL carrier in
Band 1 is equal or larger than 60MHz. The other one is degradation of Band 3
DL from Band 1 UL due to narrow frequency that the edge-to-edge separation
between the Band 1 UL and Band 3 DL is less than 60MHz. The former MSD is
specified in Tables 6.17.5-1 and 6.17.5-2, and the latter is specified in
Tables 6.17.5-3 and 6.17.5-4. When the uplink is configured in Band3, the TX-
RX separation is large enough so that there would be no MSD issues either.

NOTE: These requirements apply when the uplink is active in Band 1 and the
separation between the lower edge of the uplink channel in Band 1 and the
upper edge of the downlink channel in Band 3 is \ the BS receive band of Bands 2, 25, 33, 35, 37 and 39,
  * the 3rd harmonics may fall into none of BS receive band,
  * the 2nd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 7, > 38 and 41,
  * the 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, > 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43 > and 44;
assuming (except the last row) the whole 35MHz DL frequency of Band 8 and the
whole 200 MHz DL frequency of Band 42.
If the BS is only transmitting up to 10 MHz DL in Band 8 and 40MHz DL in Band
42 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of Band 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28 and 44 as shown in
the last row in table 4.
In terms of fall down to own BS receive band, special care required to be
taken for the case that one of three tone IMDs falls to Band 8 UL region. In
addition, another three tone IMD may fall to Band 42 UL region. Checking Band
8 fall down, assuming Band 42 bandwidth as 40MHz, majority of Band 8 UL is
subject to harmful fall down of this IMD. Thus, care required to be taken when
Band 8 and 42 BS transmitter sure the same antenna with BS receiver of Band 8.
Concerning Band 42 fall down, it does not matter since Band 42 is TDD, i.e. BS
receiver of Band 42 is expected to be stopped whenever such IMD is generated
due to simultaneous BS transmit of Band 8 and Band 42.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 10, 24 and 25 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 8 and 42.
Therefore, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands
3, 7, 9, 22, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41 and 43.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within receiver of band listed
above would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility
of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 8 and 42 BS transmitters do
not share the same antenna with BS receiver of those bands.
For Band 43, as the band is next to Band 42, care required to be taken on
actual spectrum arrangement.
#### 6.23.3.2 For the UE
As shown in Table 6.23.3.2-1, the 4^th^ harmonic of Band 8 UL will fall into
Band 42 DL.

### 6.24.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 21, Band
42 and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.24.3-1 below:
Table 6.24.3-1: Band 21, Band 42 and Band 42 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
**BS DL carriers** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** DL frequency
(MHz) 1495.9 1510.9 3400 3600 3^rd^ order IMD products (with maximum channel
bandwidth) (f1_low -- f2_BWmax) (f1_high + f2_BWmax) (f2_low -- f1_BWmax)
(f2_high + f1_BWmax) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 1455.9 1550.9 3385 3615
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.24.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (21 + 42 + 42) fall also
into Band 21.
As 3^rd^ order IMD product may fall to Band 21 receiver, it is recommended
that Bands 21 and 42 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with
Band 21 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver desensitization.

High at ETC.
Based on Table 6.24.4-3, it can be seen that the extension to include 1.5GHz
bands slightly impact insertion loss of low band, however the difference is
smaller than 0.08dB and not enough to impact specifications for other bands.
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.24.4-4 and Table 6.24.4-5 respectively.

Table 6.25.3.1-1 shows harmonics frequency limits and Table 6.25.3.1-2 shows
intermodulation products frequency limits for CA of Band 41, Band 42 and Band
42, respectively. Harmonics and intermodulation product problems are

As shown in Table 6.25.3.1-1, second and third harmonics cannot fall to UL
frequencies of existing 3GPP operating bands.

Table 6.25.3.1-2 gives the intermodulation products for Band 41 + Band 42 CA
with 2 DLs. The intermodulation products generated by two operating bands do
not impact the own receiver since TDD BS cannot transmit and receive
simultaneously in a single band.
IMD products of Bands 41 and 42 could fall into RX frequency range of some
operating bands. IMD products could fall into Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 35, 36,
37, 38, 39, 43 and 44, while Bands 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 27, 28, 39,
43 or 44 could be used in the same geographical area (Region 3) as Bands 41
and 42. With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and
receive path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it
is expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 1, 3, 5, 8, 9,
11, 18, 19, 21, 27, 28, 39, 43 or 44 receiver would be well below the receiver
noise floor, in order to avoid the possibility of receiver desensitization.
Thus it is recommended that Bands 41 and 42 BS transmitters do not share the
same antenna with Band 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 27, 28, 39, 43 or 44 BS
receivers, unless the antenna path meets more stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19,
21, 27, 28, 39, 43 or 44 BS receivers desensitization. Note that antenna
sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the
future.
#### 6.25.3.1 For the UE
For single UL of CA_41A-42C, none of the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic products
falls into the receive band of the other. For UE coexistence the single UL is
already considered for these bands in TS 36.101.
### 6.25.4 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the Î”T~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.25.4-1.

in Table 6.25.4-2 with uplink in one E-UTRA band, the minimum requirement for
reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.1-1 [2] shall be increased by the amount
given in Î”R~IB,c~ in Table 6.25.4-2 for the applicable E-UTRA bands.

carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [2] when
operating in single carrier mode
### 6.26.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
3 and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.26.3-1 below:
Table 6.26.3-1: Band 1, Band 3 and Band 42 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f1-low f1-high f2-low f2-high f3-low f3-high DL frequency (MHz)
2110 2170 1805 1880 3400 3600

f3-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 315 650
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f3-low -- f2-high) (f1-high + f3-high --
f2-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 3630 3965
3^rd^ order IMD products (f2-low + f3-low -- f1-high) (f2-high + f3-high --
f1-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 3035 3370
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f2-low + f3-low) (f1-high + f2-high +
f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 7315 7650
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.26.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3rd
order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 3 + 42) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 31 and 43, where receiver desensitization might be an
issue. Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 1, 3 and 42 BS transmitters
should not share the same antenna with Band 31 or unsynchronized Band 43 BS
receivers, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 31 or unsynchronized Band 43
BS receivers desensitization.
### 6.26.4 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ values
This 3DL combination is composed of three 2DL combinations (i.e. CA_1A-3A,
CA_1A-42A and CA_3A-42A). These 2DL combinations have already specified in
Rel-12 timeframe based on the following assumptions.
  * CA_1A-3A: Quadplexer basis
  * CA_1A-42A: Triplexer basis
  * CA_3A-42A: Triplexer and HTF basis
In CA_1A-3A-42A case, HTF will be required in order to suppress B3 harmonic as
is the case with CA_3A-42A in the following reasons.
In case of CA_3A-42A and CA_3A-42C, the requirements were generated based on
inserting the HTF between B3 PA and B3 duplexer where the HTF was placed after
B3 duplexer since the harmonic level of duplexer cannot be ignored. In
addition, since it cannot be expected that quadplexer has significantly better
linearity than duplexer, we conclude that this 3DL combination needs to place
the HTF after the quadplexer as well as shown in Figure 6.26.4-1.
{width="4.595833333333333in" height="2.2715277777777776in"}
Figure 6.26.4-1. RF architecture for CA_1A-3A-42A
In this case, relaxation due to HTF will be required for both B1 and B3, which
are Î”T~IB,c~=0.6dB and Î”R~IB,c~=0.2dB respectively. For B42, it is reasonable
to reuse the same relaxation as the cases of CA_1A-42A and CA_3A-42A, which
are Î”T~IB,c~=[0.8]dB, Î”R~IB,c~=[0.5]dB.
Based on the analysis above, for the UE which supports inter-band carrier
aggregation configurations with uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the
Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ are defined for applicable bands in Table 6.26.4-1 and
Table 6.26.4-2 respectively.

### 6.26.5 MSD
For this combination, two MSD requirements should be specified. One is
degradation of Band 3 DL from Band 1 UL due to narrow frequency separation
between the Band 1 UL and Band 3 DL. The other is degradation of Band 42 DL
due to the 2^nd^ order harmonics generated by Band 3 UL. For this 3DL
combination, it is reasonable to specify the same MSD requirements as CA_1A-3A
and CA_3A-42A respectively since no additional challenges are required. The
former MSD is specified in Tables 6.26.5-1 and 6.26.5-2, and the latter is
specified in Tables 6.25.5-3 and 6.25.5-4.

### 6.40.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 7, Band
42 and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.40.3-1 below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 9420 9890
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.40.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (7 + 42 + 42) may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 7, 38 and 41. Therefore, the focus here is
on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 7, 38 and 41.
Note that the 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS own (20 MHz)
receive block within Band 7. Assume that the 3 carriers transmitted by the
Band (7 +42 + 42) BS are a, b and c MHz in channel bandwidth and d, e and f
MHz from the lower edges of Bands 7 and 42 DL frequency bands as shown in
Figure 6.40.3-1 below:
Figure 6.40.3-1: 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (7 + 42 + 42) BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.40.3-2 below:
Figure 6.40.3-2: 3 carriers received by the Band (7 + 42 + 42) BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.40.3-2 below:
Table 6.40.3-2: Band (7 + 42 + 42) BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

(f2-high + f3-high -- f1-low) 4180 + _e_ \+ _b_ \+ _f_ \+ _c_ \-- _d_ (f1-low

+ _d_ \+ _a_ \+ _e_ \+ _b_ \+ _f_ \+ _c_
* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.40.3-2 with the BS receive
blocks in Figure 6.40.3-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD products
caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC will only fall into the BS own
receive block of Band 7 under one of the transmit configurations shown in
Table 6.40.3-3 below:

within Band 7 BS own receive blocks

### 6.48.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.48.3.1 For the BS
Table 6.48.3.1-1 gives the harmonic frequency limits for Band 3, Band 41 and
Band 41 3DL CA. As shown in the table, 2^nd^ order harmonics of the BS
transmitting may fall into the BS receive band of Band 43 and none of 3^rd^
harmonics may fall into any receive frequencies of the other E-UTRA Bands.
Table 6.48.3.1-1: DL harmonics frequency limits for CA of Band 3, Band 41 and
Band 41

3760 4992 to 5380  
3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 5415 to 5640 7488 to 8070
* * *
Table 6.48.3.1-2 gives the intermodulation products supporting 3 DL CA of Band
3, Band 41 and Band 41. In addition, the maximum transmission bandwidth of
60MHz (20MHz in Band 3 and 40MHz in Band 41) is considered for the IMD
analysis.

* * *
It can be seen from the Table 6.48.3.1-2 that the 2^nd^ order IMD products may
fall into BS receive Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28 and
44. The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation
of Band 3, Band 41 and Band 41 may fall into BS receive Bands of 1, 2, 3, 4,
7, 9, 10, 22, 23, 24, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41 and 42. However, when
the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3^rd^ order IMD products do
not fall into the BS receive of Bands 1, 4, 23, 24, 34 and 36.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25,
27, 33, 35 and 37 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as
Band 3 and Band 41. Consequently, the focus here will be on the harmonics and
IMD products falling into Bands 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 26, 28, 38, 39, 41, 42 and 44.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously in a single band, the
BS\'s own Band 41 receiver and other synchronized Band 41 receivers would not
be interfered.
It is recommended that Bands 3 and 41 BS transmitters should not share the
same antenna with Bands 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 26, 28, unsynchronized 38,
unsynchronized 39, unsynchronized 42 and unsynchronized 44 BS receivers unless
the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that
the PIM will not cause these Band\'s BS receivers desensitization. Note that
antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in
the future.
#### 6.48.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.48.3.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
3 + Band 41 CA with 1 UL.
Table 6.48.3.2-1: Impact of 1 UL Harmonic Interference
* * *
**UE UL carriers** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** UL frequency
(MHz) 1710 1785 2496 2690 2^nd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 3420 to
3570 4992 to 5380  
3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 5130 to 5355 7488 to 8070
* * *
It can be seen that the 2^nd^ order harmonics of the Band 3 transmitting may
fall into the receive band of Band 42 and none of 3^rd^ harmonics may fall
into any receive frequencies of the other E-UTRA Bands.

operating in single carrier mode.
### 6.49.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3 Band
41 and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.49.3-1 below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 7701 8170
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.49.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 41 + 42) may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26,
27, 28, 38, 41 and 44. However, Bands 6, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 27 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 3, 41and 42.
Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into
Bands 5, 7, 8, 13, 20, 26, 28, 38, 41 and 44. As B41 is a TDD band,
simultaneous Tx/Rx for the same band will not happen. So the IMD and harmonic
impact to B41 needs not to be considered.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 5, 7, 8, 13, 20,
26, 28, 38 or 44 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor
eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (3
+ 41 + 42) BS transmitter does not share the same antenna with Band 5, 7, 8,
13, 20, 26, 28, 38 or 44 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (3 +41 + 42) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 5, 7, 8, 13, 20, 26, 28, 38 or 44 BS receiver
if the aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used unless the antenna
path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will
not cause Band 5, 7, 8, 13, 20, 26, 28, 38 or 44 BS receiver desensitization.
Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to
evolve in the future.

### 6.50.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.50.3.1 For the BS
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 5, Band 40 and Band 40 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one
component carrier in each band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.50.3.1-1
below. In addition, the maximum transmission bandwidth of 60MHz (10MHz in Band
5 and 40MHz in Band 40) is considered for the IMD analysis.
Table 6.50.3.1-1: Band 5, Band 40 and Band 40 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

(f2_high + f1_BWmax) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 829 934 2290 2410
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.50.3.1-1 that the 2^nd^ order IMD products may
fall into the BS receive band of Band 11 and Band 21. The 3^rd^ IMD products
caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 5, Band 40 and Band 40 may
fall into the BS receive bands of Band 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27,
30, 40, 43 and 44. However, when the impact of maximum bandwidth is
considered, the 3^rd^ order IMD products do not fall into the BS receive of
Bands 13, 14, 27 and 44.
It should be noted that Bands 6, 18, 19 and 20 are not intended for use in the
same geographical area as Band 5 and Band 40. Consequently, the focus here
will be on the harmonics and IMD products falling into Bands 5, 8, 26, 30, 40
and 43.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously, so the BS\'s own Band 40
receiver and other synchronized Band 40 receivers would not be interfered.
It is recommended that Band 5 and Band 40 BS transmitters should not share the
same antenna with Bands 5, 8, 26, 30 and unsynchronized Band 43 receiver,
unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so
that the PIM will not cause band\'s receiver desensitization. Note that
antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in
the future.
#### 6.50.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.50.3.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
5 + Band 40 CA with 1UL.
Table 6.50.3.2-1: Impact of 1 UL Harmonic Interference

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 2472 to 2547 6900 to 7200
* * *
It can be seen that the UL harmonic frequencies of Band 5 and Band 40 does not
locate within the UE receive bands of interest in the DL. Therefore we can
conclude that there is no issue on UL harmonic interference.

### 6.51.3 Co-existence studies
The harmonic frequencies are observed in Table 6.51.3-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 3^rd^ harmonic interference from Band 3 UL
to Band 46 DL. It was agreed not to apply HTF for this CA combination. How to
treat MSD requirements is FFS.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 3 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 6.51.3-2 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.51.3-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 3 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 22, 42 and 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34,
35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41. Note that the calculation in Table 6.51.3-2
(except the last row) assumes the BS transmits the whole 60 and 775 MHz DL
frequency of Band 3 and Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20MHz and 40 MHz DL in Band 3 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.51.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24,
25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39 and 40 as shown in the last row in Table
6.51.3-2.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 3 and 46 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42 and 43.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by

It can be seen from Table 6.52.3-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 1 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 22, 42 and 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41. Note that the
calculation in Table 6.52.3-2 (except the last row) assumes the BS transmits
the whole 60 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 1 and Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20MHz and 40 MHz DL in Band 1 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.52.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26
and 27 as shown in the last row in Table 6.52.3-2.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 1 and 46 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 42 and

### 6.53.3 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/3 DL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 2, Band
4 and Band 7 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each band)
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.53.3-1 below:

IMD frequency limits (MHz) 6660 6835
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.53.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 4 + 13) may fall into
the BS receive band of Band 7, Band 40 and Band 41. However, Band 40 and Band
41 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 2, 4 and 7.
Therefore, except the frequency bands impacted by harmonics and IMD products
from the constituent 2 DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order IMD products
caused by BS supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 4 + 7) will fall into the BS
receive band of Band 7 amongst bands operating in the same geographical area.
### 6.53.4 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ values
For deriving Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ values for Band (2 + 4 + 7) we use filter
data based on a hexplexer implemented in FBAR technology but also make a
comparison to the 2DL band combinations Band (2 + 4) Band (4 + 7) already
specified in view of other implementations. These 2DL combinations are also
fallback modes of Band (2 + 4 + 7). The requirements for the 2DL fallback
modes should not be more stringent than the corresponding 2DL combinations for
UE supporting the 3DL combination Band (2 + 4 + 7), even though the filter
technologies improve. Furthermore, most UE support a multiple of combinations
so filter replication is a challenge.
Figure 6.53.4-1 displays the broadband response of a Band (2 + 4 + 7)
hexplexer. The plots below represent the performance of typical filters at
room temperature (25C). However, reading the plots 5 MHz outside the nominal
frequency band corresponds fairly well to extended temperature conditions
(ETC) for -20 to +85 C. The TX and RX passband responses for B2, B4 and B7 are
shown in detail for frequencies up to 5 MHz outside the nominal frequency
range in Figure 6.53.4-1, Figure 6.53.4-2 and Figure 6.53.4-3, respectively.

In order to estimate the Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ we compare the maximum IL 5 MHz
outside the passband for each band displayed in the figures above to the
specified IL for commercial B2 and B4 and B7 duplexers also implemented in
FBAR. The results are shown in Table 6.53.4-1 and Table 6.53.4-2 with the \"IL
quadplexer\" obtained by reading 5 MHz outside the nominal frequency range in
the figures above and the \"IL duplexer\" the quoted minimum performance at
ETC for the corresponding duplexer (in production). The estimated Î”T~IB,c~ and
Î”R~IB,c~ are derived by using the shared-pain rule (50% of the IL), the values
in brackets are the maximum values for the existing 2DL combinations Band (2 +
4) and Band (4 + 7) shown in Table 6.53.4-3.

The requirement for a constituent band of a 2DL mode of the 3DL combination
should not be more stringent than the requirement for the corresponding
\"standalone\" requirements for a UE not supporting the 3DL combination. This
leads to the requirements shown in Table 6.53.4-4 and Table 6.53.4-5. However,
the results obtained from the simulation of the hexplexer suggest that the
requirement for the 2DL standalone combination Band (2 + 7) could be tighter
than the corresponding fallback mode of Band (2 + 4 + 7).

### 6.54.3 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/3 DL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 2, Band
7 and Band 12 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.54.3-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.54.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 7 + 12) may fall into
the BS receive band of Band 46.
Therefore, except the frequency bands impacted by harmonics and IMD products
from the constituent 2 DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order IMD products
caused by BS supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 7 + 12) will not fall into the BS
receive band of any other licensed frequency band operating in the same
geographical area.
### 6.54.4 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ values
For deriving the Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ for Band (2 + 7+ 12) we compare to the
hexplexer data obtained for Band (2 + 4 + 7) and the requirements for existing
2DL combinations. Moreover, we assume a UE front-end module with an antenna
diplexer and the high bands supported by either a dedicated duplexer or a
multiplexer including e.g. Band 4 or Band 66. The requirements for the
existing 2DL combination Band (1 + 7) are Î”T~IB,c~ = 0.5 dB and Î”R~IB,c~ = 0
dB for both constituent bands; Band(2 \+ 7) (see TR 852-13) should have
similar performance. This is also evidenced by the results for the more
complex hexplexer supporting Band (2 + 4 + 7). Altogether this suggests the
requirements shown in Table 6.54.4-1 and Table 6.54.4-2.

### 7.1.3 Harmonics and IMD study
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 2, Band
4 and Band 30 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 7.1.3-1 below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 6390 6505
* * *
It can be seen from Table 7.1.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of harmonics
and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order
IMD products supporting 3DL CA of Band (2 + 4 + 30) may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 38 and 41. However, Bands 3, 7, 9 and 38
are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 2, 4 and 30.
Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into
Bands 4, 10 and 41.
Note that the 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS own receive block
within Band 4. Assume that the 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (2 + 4 + 30)
BS are _a_ , _b_ and _c_ MHz in channel bandwidth and _d_ , _e_ and _f_ MHz
from the lower edges of Bands 2, 4 and 30 DL frequency bands as shown in
Figure 7.1.3-1 below:
{width="6.690972222222222in" height="1.1520833333333333in"}
Figure 7.1.3-1: 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (2 + 4 + 30) BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 7.1.3-2 below:
{width="6.690972222222222in" height="1.1520833333333333in"}
Figure 7.1.3-2: 3 carriers received by the Band (2 + 4 + 30) BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3
component carriers (CC) can be calculated as shown in Table 7.1.3-2 below:
Table 7.1.3-2: Band (2 + 4 + 30) BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *

f3-high) 1690 + _d_ \+ _e_ \-- _f_ \-- _c_ (f1-high + f2-high -- f3-low) 1690
+ _d_ \+ _a_ \+ _e_ \+ _b_ \-- _f_ (f1-low + f3-low -- f2-high) 2170 + _d_ \+
_f_ \-- _e_ \-- _b_ (f1-high + f3-high -- f2-low) 2170 + _d_ \+ _a_ \+ _f_ \+
_c_ \-- _e_ (f2-low + f3-low -- f1-high) 2530 + _e_ \+ _f_ \-- _d_ \-- _a_
(f2-high + f3-high -- f1-low) 2530 + _e_ \+ _b_ \+ _f_ \+ _c_ \-- _d_ (f1-low
+ f2-low + f3-low) 6390 + _d_ \+ _e_ \+ _f_ (f1-high + f2-high + f3-high) 6390
+ _d_ \+ _a_ \+ _e_ \+ _b_ \+ _f_ \+ _c_
* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 7.1.3-2 with the BS receive blocks
in Figure 7.1.3-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused
in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC will only fall into the BS own receive
block of Band 4 under one of the transmit configurations shown in Table
7.1.3-3 below:
Table 7.1.3-3: Band (2 + 4 + 30) BS transmit configurations with 3^rd^ IMD
within Band 4 BS own receive blocks
