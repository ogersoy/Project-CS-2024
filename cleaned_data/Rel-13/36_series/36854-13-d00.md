# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report for 4DL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-13 time frame. The purpose is to gather the relevant
background information and studies in order to address 4DL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation requirements.
The present document covers relevant background information and studies in
order to address 4DL Inter-band Carrier Aggregation requirements for the
Rel-13 band combinations in Table 1-1.
The present document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination).

# 5 4-Band Carrier Aggregation with Single UL: General Part
## 5.1 BS specific
Harmonics and IMD are measured as the ratio in power levels between the
distortion signal and the input signal in units of dBc. The magnitudes of the
harmonics and IMD depend on the characteristics of the non-linear element, and
the magnitude normally decreases as the order of the harmonics and IMD
increases. For this reason, lower order harmonics and IMD products are
considered the most damaging to wireless systems, while the higher order
harmonics and IMD products are generally less damaging. Therefore, the BS
studies of harmonics and IMD have been focused on the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order
harmonics and IMD products caused by BS transmission of the component carriers
in the CA configurations under study.
Note that there is not any additional 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD
products caused by BS transmission of the CC in a 4DL CA configuration when
compared to the constituent 3 DL CA configurations, provided that the 4DL CA
configuration does not use a larger carrier channel bandwidth or aggregated
channel bandwidth in any of the CA bands when compared to the constituent 3 DL
CA configurations. Therefore, no additional BS study of 2^nd^ and 3^rd^
harmonics and IMD products will be required for a 4DL CA configuration, if it
does not use a larger carrier channel bandwidth or aggregated channel
bandwidth in any of the CA bands when compared to the constituent 3 DL CA
configurations, and the BS studies of 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics and IMD
products for all the constituent 3 DL CA configurations have been performed.

#### 6.1.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_25-41-41-41
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting the 4DL CA configurations of Band 25 and Band 41 (4DL CA with one
component carrier in Band 25 and three contiguous component carriers in Band
41) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.1.1.2-1 below.

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.1.1.2-1 that the 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting 4DL CA of Band 25 and Band 41 may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 12, 17, 28 and 44, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 22, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 41 and 42. Note that the calculation in Table 6.1.1.2-1
(except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 65 MHz
frequency of Band 25 and the whole 194 MHz frequency of Band 41. If the BS is
only transmitting an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 25 and an up to 60 MHz DL in Band
41 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3rd IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of Band 3, 4, 9 or 10 as shown in the last row in Table
6.1.1.2-1. Moreover, the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS own (up
to 20 MHz) receive block within Band 25, as the transmit-receiver frequency
separation is 80 MHz.
Note that Bands 1, 7, 11, 21, 28, 33, 34, 38, 39 and 44 are not intended for
use in the same geographical area as Bands 25 and 41. Moreover, co-location of
Band 25 transmitter and Band 35, 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-
location on adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain site-
engineering solutions to avoid mutual interference. Furthermore, the Band 41
BS deployed in the same geographical area are assumed to be synchronized so
that the Band 41 BS receivers will not be interfered by the Band 41 BS
transmission. Therefore, the focus here is on the IMD falling into Bands 2,
12, 17, 22, 23, 25 and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 12,
17, 22 or 42 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating
the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 25 and 41 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 12, 17, 22 or 42 BS
receiver. But there is not a large frequency gap between Band 25 DL and Bands
2, 23 and 25 UL, and hence Bands 2, 23 and 25 BS receiver desensitization may
still be an issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 25 and 41 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 2, 23 or 25 BS receiver to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, or with Band 12, 17, 22 or 42 BS receiver unless the
antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the
PIM will not cause Band 12, 17, 22 or 42 BS receiver desensitization. Note
that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to
evolve in the future.

#### 6.2.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_2A-2A-4A-12A
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting CA_2A-2A-4A-12A
(i.e. 4DL CA with one component carrier on bands 4 and 12 and two carriers on
band 2) are derived in the constituent 3DL and 2DL CAs, which have been
already analysed and captured into 3GPP TR 36.853-12.
Table 6.2.1.2-1 shows the second and third order UL harmonics for bands 2, 4
and 12. It can be seen that 2^nd^ harmonic of band 2 may fall to band 43 and
that 2^nd^ harmonic of band 4 may fall to band 42. 3^rd^ harmonics of band 12
may fall to band 1 and 4. Currently bands 1, 42 and 43 are not used in same
geographical areas as the CA_2A-4A-4A-12A. Band 12 transmitter will cause
desensitization to own band 4 downlink but this desensitization is already
captured in to TS 36.101.

#### 6.2.1.3 Î”TIB,c and Î”RIB,c (1 UL)
For CA_2A-4A-4A-12A, relaxations values can be derived from the ones for
CA_2A-4A, CA_2A-12A, and CA_4A-12A by applying the 3DL framework and come up
with relaxations for three bands. These relaxations are same as for
CA_2A-4A-12.

A part of the uplink of Band 12 may create third order harmonics into part of
Band 4 downlink. The reference sensitivity already analysed for CA_2A-4A-12A
can be reused for CA_2A-2A-4A-12A because the relaxation values are the same.

Note: UL carrier will be supported in each of the 4 bands being aggregated.
#### 6.3.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_1-3-7-8
The 2nd and 3rd harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of
Band 1, Band 3, Band 7 and Band 8 DL carriers (i.e. 4DL CA with one component
carrier in each band) are derived in the constituent 3DL and 2DL CAs, which
have been already analysed.
#### 6.3.1.3 âˆ†T~IB~ and âˆ†R~IB~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Tables 6.3.1-3-1 and 6.3.1.3-2 respectively.

#### 6.3.1.3 MSD
For this combination, two MSD scenarios need to be considered. One is when the
uplink is band 8; the second order harmonic could fall into band 3 and third
order harmonic could fall into band 7. The requirement can be specified in a
similar way as CA_3A-8A and CA_7A-8A as shown in Table 6.3.1.3-1.
Another scenario is when the uplink is in band 1, where band 3 DL may not be
separated enough from band 1 UL. This can be specified in a similar way as
CA_1A-3A as shown in Table 6.3.1.3-2.
##### 6.3.1.3.1 MSD for Band 8 Uplink
A part of the uplink of Band 8, specifically 880-897 MHz (only first 17MHz)
may create third order harmonics into part of Band 7 downlink, specifically
2640-2690 MHz (only last 50 MHz). The reference sensitivity exception already
analysed for CA_7A-8A can be reused for CA_1A-3A-7A-8A because the Î”T~IB,c~
for Band 8 and Î”R~IB,c~ for Band 7 and 8 are the same between CA_7A-8A and
CA_1A-3A-7A-8A. There is no desensitization to Band 1 due to no harmonic
relation and no additional relaxation for Band 1 Rx. Band 3 desens is not
currently specified in RAN4 as the harmonics overlapping between Band 3 and
Band 8 is considered insignificant. Therefore the reference sensitivity
exception for CA_1A-3A-7A-8A can be specified in the following.

##### 6.3.1.3.2 MSD for Band 1 Uplink
For CA_1A-3A, Band 3 MSD is specified when the separation of band 1 uplink
channel edge and band 3 downlink channel edge is less than 60 MHz. This Band 3
MSD is applied in the similar way to CA_1A-3A-7A-8A when the uplink is in Band
1. Although Î”T~IB,c~ for Band 1 is different between CA_1A-3A and
CA_1A-3A-7A-8A by 0.3dB, it is assumed that the same MSD can be reused. For
Band 1, 7 and 8, the sensitivity is only degraded by Î”R~IB,c~ from the single
band one. Therefore the reference sensitivity exception for CA_1A-3A-7A-8A can
be specified in the following.

#### 6.4.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_2A-4A-4A-12A
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting CA_2A-4A-4A-12A
(i.e. 4DL CA with one component carrier on bands 2 and 12 and two carriers on
band 4) are derived in the constituent 3DL and 2DL CAs, which have been
already analysed and captured into 3GPP TR 36.853-12 V12.0.0
Table 6.4.1.2-1 shows the second and third order UL harmonics for bands 2, 4
and 12. It can be seen that 2^nd^ harmonic of band 2 may fall to band 43 and
that 2^nd^ harmonic of band 4 may fall to band 42. 3^rd^ harmonics of band 12
may fall to band 1 and 4. Currently bands 1, 42 and 43 are not used in same

desensitization to own band 4 downlink but this desensitization is already

#### 6.4.1.3 Î”TIB,c and Î”RIB,c (1 UL)
For CA_2A-4A-4A-12A, we can derive the relaxations values from the ones for
CA_2A-4A, CA_2A-12A, and CA_4A-12A by applying the 3DL framework and come up
with relaxations for three bands. These relaxations are same as for
CA_2A-4A-12.

A part of the uplink of Band 12 may create third order harmonics into part of
Band 4 downlink. The reference sensitivity already analysed for CA_2A-4A-12A
can be reused for CA_2A-2A-4A-12A because the relaxation values are the same.

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE supports all single carrier bandwidths for the
constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [2] when operating
in single carrier mode.
#### 6.14.1.2 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/4 DL
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting
CA_1A-3A-19A-42A follow from those derived for the constituent 2DL and 3DL CA
fall-back modes, which have been analysed and captured in [6], [4] and [5].
#### 6.14.1.3 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the Î”T~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.14.1.3-1.
Table 6.14.1.3-1: Î”T~IB,c~ for 4DLs aggregation

* * *
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configuration in
Table 6.14.1.3-2 with uplink in one E-UTRA band, the minimum requirement for
reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.1-1 (TS 36.101) will be increased by the
amount given in Î”R~IB,c~ in Table 6.14.1.3-2.

* * *
#### 6.14.1.4 MSD
For this combination, two MSD requirements should be specified. One is
degradation of Band 3 DL from Band 1 UL due to narrow frequency separation
between the Band 1 UL and Band 3 DL. The other is degradation of Band 42 DL
due to the 2nd order harmonics generated by Band 3 UL. For this 4DL
combination, it is reasonable to specify the same MSD requirements as
CA_1A-3A-42A since no additional challenges are required due to additional
Band 19 DL. The former MSD is specified in Tables 6.14.1.4-1 and 6.14.1.4-2,
and the latter is specified in Tables 6.14.1.4-3 and 6.14.1.4-4.

| 42 |  |  | See CA_42C in Table 5.6A.1-1 Bandwidth combination set 0 [2] |  |  |  |  |   
NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE supports all single carrier bandwidths for the
constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [2] when operating
in single carrier mode.
#### 6.15.1.2 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/4 DL
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting
CA_1A-3A-42C follow from those derived for the constituent 2DL and 3DL CA
fall-back modes, which have been analysed and captured in [6], [4] and [5].
#### 6.15.1.3 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the Î”T~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.15.1.3-1.
Table 6.15.1.3-1: Î”T~IB,c~ for 4DLs aggregation

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configuration in
Table 6.15.1.3-2 with uplink in one E-UTRA band, the minimum requirement for
reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.1-1 (TS 36.101) will be increased by the
amount given in Î”R~IB,c~ in Table 6.15.1.3-2.

#### 6.15.1.4 MSD
For this combination, two MSD requirements should be specified. One is
degradation of Band 3 DL from Band 1 UL due to narrow frequency separation
between the Band 1 UL and Band 3 DL. The other is degradation of Band 42 DL
due to the 2nd order harmonics generated by Band 3 UL. For this 4DL
combination, it is reasonable to specify the same MSD requirements as
CA_1A-3A-42A since no additional challenges are required due to additional
Band 42 DL. The former MSD is specified in Tables 6.15.1.4-1 and 6.15.1.4-2,
and the latter is specified in Tables 6.15.1.4-3 and 6.15.1.4-4.

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE supports all single carrier bandwidths for the
constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [2] when operating
in single carrier mode.
#### 6.21.1.2 Co-existence studies for 41C-42C
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics frequency limits and IMD products caused
in the BS by transmitting of Band 41, Band 41,Band 42 and Band 42 follow from
those derived for the constituent 3DL CA fall-back modes, which have been
analysed and captured in [3].
By considering the maximum transmission bandwidth of 80MHz (40MHz in Band 41
and Band 42, respectively), the additional intermodulation products supporting
4 DL CA of Band 41, Band 41, Band 42 and Band 42 are given in Table
6.21.1.2-1.

frequency limits (MHz) 2456 2730 3360 3640
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.21.1.2-1, in addition to the impacts of harmonics
and IMD products from the constituent 3DL CA configurations, there is no 3^rd^
order IMD products supporting 4DL CA of Band 41, Band 41, Band 42 and Band 42
fall into the other bands.
#### 6.21.1.3 âˆ†T~IB~ and âˆ†R~IB~ values

#### 6.29.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_39A-41D
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting the 4DL CA configurations of CA_39A-41D can be calculated as
shown in Table 6.29.1.2-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.29.1.2-1 that 2^nd^ order harmonics may fall into
BS receive band of band 43, two-tone 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into BS
receive band of band 12, 13, 14, 17, 27, 28, 44. 3^rd^ order IMD products may
fall to UL frequencies of Band 1, 2, 7, 22, 25, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38 or 42.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 39, Band 41,Bnd 41and
Band 41 should not share the same antenna with Band 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17,
22, 25, 27, 28, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43 or 44 BS receiver, unless the
antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM specification so that the
PIM will not cause Band 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 25, 27, 28, 33, 35, 36,
37, 38, 42, 43 or 44 BS receiver desensitization.
For single UL non-simultaneous UE, the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic analysis for
B39 and B41 is done in the 2DL/1UL TR 36.851. None of the products falls into
the B39 or B41 UE receiving bands.

NOTE 1: The CA Configuration refers to a combination of an operating band and a CA bandwidth class specified in Table 5.6A-1 (the indexing letter). Absence of a CA bandwidth class for an operating band implies support of all classes. NOTE 2: For each band combination, all combinations of indicated bandwidths belong to the set. NOTE 3: For the supported CC bandwidth combinations, the CC downlink and uplink bandwidths are equal. NOTE 4: Uplink CA configurations are the configurations supported by the present release of specifications. NOTE 5: For TDD inter-band Carrier Aggregation only non-simultaneous Rx/Tx uplink CA configurations can be supported by UE supporting corresponding DL CA configuration without simultaneous Rx/Tx. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

It can be seen from Table 6.30.1.2-1 that 2^nd^ order harmonics may fall into

fall to UL frequencies of Band 1, 2, 7, 22, 25, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38 or 42.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 39, Band 39,Bnd 41and
Band 41 should not share the same antenna with Band 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17,

NOTE 1: The CA Configuration refers to a combination of an operating band and a CA bandwidth class specified in Table 5.6A-1 (the indexing letter). Absence of a CA bandwidth class for an operating band implies support of all classes. NOTE 2: For each band combination, all combinations of indicated bandwidths belong to the set. NOTE 3: For the supported CC bandwidth combinations, the CC downlink and uplink bandwidths are equal. NOTE 4: Uplink CA configurations are the configurations supported by the present release of specifications. NOTE 5: For TDD inter-band Carrier Aggregation only non-simultaneous Rx/Tx uplink CA configurations can be supported by UE supporting corresponding DL CA configuration without simultaneous Rx/Tx. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

#### 6.32.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_3A-28A-40C
The 2nd and 3rd harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of
Band 3, Band 28, Band 40 and Band 40 DL carriers (i.e. 4DL CA with one
component carrier in each band) are derived in the constituent 3DL and 2DL
CAs, which have been already analysed.
#### 6.32.1.3 Î”TIB,c and Î”RIB,c (1 UL)
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Tables 6.32.1.3-1 and 6.32.1.3-2 respectively.

#### 6.32.1.4 MSD
For this combination, there are two aspects need to be considered. Firstly
B28-B40 and B3-B40 poor cross-band isolation may cause MSD, secondly lower
band Rx harmonic mixing problem for B28+B40 will also be considered. For this
4DL combination, it is reasonable to specify the same MSD requirements as
CA_3A-40A and CA_28A-40A respectively since no additional challenges are
required. Therefore the reference sensitivity requirement can be specified in
Table 6.32.1.4-1 and Table 6.32.1.4-2 with the exceptions shown in Tables
6.32.1.4-3 and 6.32.1.4-4.

#### 6.33.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_28A-40D
Table 6.33.1.2-1 shows harmonics frequency limits and intermodulation products
frequency limits for CA of Band 28, Band 40, Band 40 and Band 40\. Harmonics
and intermodulation product problems are summarized below the relevant Table.

It can be seen from Table 6.33.1.2-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics of
Band 28 and Band 40 DL carriers may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 30
and 40, the 2^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 24
and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8,
12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 30, 40, 43 and 44. Since Bands 6, 12,
13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, 27, 30, 43 and 44 are not intended for use in
the same geographical area as Bands 28 and 40, the focus here will be on the
harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 5, 8, 28 and 40. As B40 is a TDD band,
simultaneous Tx/Rx for the same band will not happen. So the IMD and harmonic
impact to B40 needs not to be considered.
It is recommended that Bands 28 and 40 BS transmitters should not share the
same antenna with Bands 5, 8 and 28 receivers unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will
not cause Band 5, 8 and 28 BS receivers desensitization. Note that antenna
sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the
future.

#### 6.42.1.4 MSD
For this combination including Band 4 and Band 12, harmonic REFSENS need to be
defined. The MSD is specified in Table 6.42.1.4-1 and 6.42.1.4-2.
The REFSENS requirements for Band 4 and Band 12 are derived from the values
from existing values for CA_4A-12A, and for Band 30 the REFSENS requirements
from the existing values for CA_2A-4A-29A-30A and CA_4A-29A-30A. The uplink
values for Band 12 are derived from existing values for CA_4A-4A-12A.

#### 6.48.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_3-46
The harmonic frequencies are observed in Table 6.48.1.2-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 3^rd^ harmonic interference from Band 3 UL
to Band 46 DL. It was agreed not to apply HTF for this CA combination. How to
treat MSD requirements is FFS.

Table 6.48.1.2-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier
aggregation of Band 3 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive band of Bands 22,
42 and 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
39, 40 and 41. Note that the calculation in Table 6.48.1.2-2 (except the last
row) assumes the BS transmits the whole 60 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 3
and Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20MHz and 60 MHz DL in Band 3 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.48.1.1-2, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24,
25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39 and 40 as shown in the last row in Table
6.48.1.2-2.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 3 and 46 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33,

It can be seen from Table 6.49.1.2-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS

If the BS only transmits up to 20MHz and 60 MHz DL in Band 1 and Band 46

fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26
and 27 as shown in the last row in Table 6.49.1.2-2.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 1 and 46 BS transmitters should not

The 2nd and 3rd harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of
Band 2, Band 4, Band 7 and Band 12 DL carriers (i.e. 4DL CA with one component
carrier in each band) are derived in the constituent 3DL and 2DL CAs, which
have been already analyzed.
#### 6.50.1.3 âˆ†T~IB~ and âˆ†R~IB~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.50.1-3-1 and 6.50.1.3-2 respectively. The
requirements are based on a UE architecture with an antenna diplexer and a
hexplexer supporting the Band (2 + 4 + 7) combination for which requirements
are studied in [3]. The Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ proposed account for the Band (4
+ 12) fallback mode for which exceptions are allowed for harmonics.

For this combination, exceptions are allowed for Band 4 when the uplink is
active in Band 12. It is assumed that the desensitization in Band 4 is the
same as that for the Band (4 + 12) combination. The resulting REFSENS
performance is shown in Table 6.50.1.4-1 with the corresponding UL allocation
in Table 6.50.1.4-2 with due account of the Î”R~IB,c~ proposed Table 6.50.1.3-2
