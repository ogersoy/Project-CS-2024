# 4 Background
## 4.1 Band allocation plan and regulatory background
The frequency bands 1 980-2 010 MHz and 2 170-2 200 MHz was allocated for the
satellite component of IMT in most countries, while it does not preclude the
use of these bands for mobile services which are co-allocated to these bands
as primary services in the Radio Regulations.\ In fact, the Korean government
is planning to take these bands into account to use for terrestrial IMT.
Furthermore, the efficient spectrum utilization may be expected if the bands 1
980-2 010 MHz and 2 170-2 200 MHz are allocated for the mobile service because
the adjacent band 1 (1 920-1 980 MHz and 2 110-2 200 MHz) is or will be used
for LTE in several countries.
The purpose of this study item is to facilitate and harmonize the efficient
use of these bands for terrestrial IMT, especially LTE, for Korea and other
applicable countries in Region 3.
The terrestrial network equipment will adhere to all 3GPP emission masks to
protect adjacent band services.\ It is expected that the impact on the co-
existence with adjacent bands will be will be covered by this study.

2170-2200 MHz are:
Study related aspects of adding a FDD band into E-UTRA that covers the
frequency range of UL: (2010-X)-2010/DL: (2220-X)-2200 MHz;
Determine parameter X (30 MHz ≦ X ≦ 70MHz with 10 MHz step);
Study coexistence issues with adjacent bands (e.g. Band 34);
Identify regulatory issues;
Study the possibility to harmonize this band.
## 5.1 CA feasibility with Band 1
To analyze the CA feasibility, four candidate options for the combination of
channel arrangement and duplexer for MSS band can be considered
**\- Stand alone band : 2x30MHz (Single duplexer)**
**\- Expended band : 2x50MHz, 2x70MHz (single duplexer)**
**\- Super set band : 2x90MHz (Dual duplexer)**
For the dual duplexer in Super set band, mixture of band 1 duplexer and MSS
band duplexer with 50 or 70MHz can be considered.
To analyze CA feasibility for various channel arrangements, UE architecture of
CA should be considered to increase the value and efficiency of the new band.
In the CA study, RAN4 considered that CA bands can share common antenna in
transceiver even in Low + High CA band combination. Therefore, we assume such
a common antenna sharing architecture for Band 1 and MSS band. A separated
antenna configuration per band is also studied in this contribution.
Figure 5.1-1 is the RF architecture of MSS band UE to support CA features with
band 1 or other bands.
{width="3.915277777777778in" height="2.963888888888889in"}
Figure 5.1-1. UE RF example architecture 1 for MSS band
In case MSS band is 30MHz wide, Architecture 1 in Figure 5.1-1 can be
considered as a possible implementation. In Figure 5.1-1, to keep the current
Band 1 REFSENS, Quadplexer should guarantee appropriate isolation and ILs.
However, this is difficult in current technology.
If the channel arrangement of new MSS band is larger than 30MHz, then
Quadplexer in Figure 5.1-1 cannot be used as candidate UE RF architecture due
to practical design issues to divide two signals in overlapped regions with
Band 1. In this case, other UE RF structure should be considered. An example
of this implementation is described in Figure 5.1-2. Based on this, we have
the following observation.
**Observation 1: If new MSS band is equal or larger than 30MHz, Quadplexer
cannot be used as candidate UE RF architecture.**
{width="4.972222222222222in" height="3.6645833333333333in"}
Figure 5.1-2. UE RF example architecture 2 for MSS band
Architecture2 can be able to support all channel arrangement for new band. For
the 2x30, 2x50 and 2x70MHz MSS band is supported by MSS duplexer. And 2x90MHz
channel arrangement is also able to operate with dual duplexer such as Band 1
duplexer and MSS band duplexer. To maintain the same performance with Band 1,
MSS duplexer can be used up to 2x70MHz.
### 5.1.1 Inter-band CA with Band 1 and new MSS band
For the architecture 1 using Quadplexer, inter-band CA is possible when new
MSS band is defined with 2x30MHz, but Quadplexer design issues are critical
point to guarantee isolation between Band1 and new MSS band and keep the ILs.
And also it is quite difficult to provide sufficient attenuation to Band 34 to
meet the UE coexistence requirements from Band 1 transmission. Other channel
arrangements cannot support inter-band CA in example architecture1.
Therefore, architecture1 is not sufficient to support inter-band CA between
Band 1 and new MSS band.
For the architecture2 using band 1 duplexer and MSS duplexer, inter-band CA is
not possible due to common antenna configuration. The received signal flows
just into one of two receiver path between Band 1 and MSS band by antenna
switch. That is our obserbation2 as follow
**Observation 2: For UE RF architecture2 using band 1 duplexer and MSS
duplexer, inter-band CA is not possible due to common antenna configuration.**
Hence, we can know that the inter-band CA is not possible in two candidate
architectures. But if separate antenna configuration per each band is
considered, then inter-band CA is possible as shown in Figure 5.1.1-1.
{width="3.536111111111111in" height="3.0416666666666665in"}
Figure 5.1.1-1. UE RF example architecture 3 for MSS band
However, to support the separate antenna configuration in architecture 3, UE
needs some investigation to achieve antenna performance such as antenna
correlation and isolation and also it is quite difficult to obtain extra space
to implement additional antennas and individual RF components per each band.
So our observation 3 is as follow
**Observation 3: For UE RF architecture 3 with separate antenna configuration
per band, the UE can support inter-band CA, but UE needs further investigation
on antenna performance and should obtain extra space to implement additional
components.**
### 5.1.2 Intra-band CA for extended band
  1. 
```{=html}
``` 1\.
For the 2x50MHz, 2x70MHz and 2x90MHz channel arrangements, RAN4 should
consider how to support intra-band contiguous CA and/or intra-band non-
contiguous CA in MSS band. But one important point is that Quadplexer cannot
be used due to overlapped regions within Band 1. And also single duplexer does
not guarantee the existing Band 1 Rx isolation level and require additional
ILs for 2x90MHz.
To analyze intra-band CA feasibility, RAN4 can consider candidate UE RF
architecture2. From Figure 5.1-2, we can see that intra-band CA can only be
supported within MSS band duplexer up to 70MHz.
{width="5.010416666666667in" height="2.2402777777777776in"}
Figure 5.1.2-1. Example Intra-band CA in MSS band
In other words, for the 2x90MHz channel arrangement, it cannot be supported
intra-band CA between CC1 in MSS duplexer and CC2 in Band 1 duplexer which is
located outside of MSS duplexer since each CC is operated by separated
duplexer as shown in Figure 5.1.2-1.
From Figure 5.1.2-1, we can see that intra-CA cannot be supported with
architecture 2 in some cases where each CC signal is located within each
duplexer. So we have following observation 4.
**Observation 4: In architecture2, intra-band CA can only be supported when
CC1 and CC2 are located in MSS duplexer up to 70MHz, but other cases could not
be supported as intra-band CA.**
For the architecture 3, intra-band CA is able to be supported as shown in
Figure 5.1.1-1. However UE need to further investigate on the antenna
performance and obtain extra space for additional antenna and RF components.
## 5.2 Analysis of legacy Band 1 impacts
Figure 5.2-1 shows a candidate UE RF architecture of MSS band UE for 2x90MHz
channel arrangements to support CA features with Band 1 or other bands. For
the dual duplexer in super set band, mixture of Band 1 duplexer and MSS band
duplexer with 30, 50, 70MHz or 90MHz BW can be considered.
Figure 5.2-1: UE RF example architecture for new band
To analyse the Band 1 and new band UE performance, we can consider two cases
as follow
\- Case1 : Using Legacy Band 1 duplexer to support E-UTRA carriers within
1920-1980/ 2110-2170MHz (lower duplexer)
\- Case2 : Using upper duplexer to support CA or sing CC operation out-of the
Band 1 range
> The upper duplexer should be as minimum 2x50MHz (to support single carrier),
> 2x70MHz (to support contiguous CA within 2x90MHz) or 2x90MHz (to support NC
> CA within 2x90MHz)
### 5.2.1 Case1: Using Legacy Band 1 duplexer to support E-UTRA carriers
within 1920-1980/2110-2170MHz
Generally, only Band 1 operators can use the legacy Band 1 duplexer in dual
duplexer architecture as shown in Figure 5.2.1-1
Figure 5.2.1-1: Use case for using legacy Band 1 duplexer in new band
The signal does flow through the Band 1 duplexer, so the Band 1 REFSENS and
MOP can be reused when the signal belong to Band 1 frequency range.
In other words, if the UE is only operating within the Band 1 frequencies can
use the legacy Band 1 duplexer, therefore the legacy system can maintain the
existing UE RF requirements.
This is our observations as follow
**Observation 1: For dual duplexer UE RF architecture, the lower duplexer is a
Band 1 duplexer, therefore the UE can maintain the existing UE RF requirements
in Band 1.**
### 5.2.2 Case 2: Using upper duplexer to support CA or sing CC operation out-
of the Band 1 range
In case the upper duplexer is between 2x50MHz and 2x70MHz, the same
performance of Band 1 can be assumed, as it has been reported.
Figure 5.2.2-1: Use case for using new 90MHz band duplexer in new band
Figure 5.2.2-1 shows a candidate architecture with a 2x90MHz as dual duplexer.
The initial additional IL for a 2x90MHz duplexer can be increased up to 1.8dB
for SAW filters [3]. This filter implementation can also be improved within
the highest frequencies of the 2x90MHz to improve the band performance. The
improved IL for this scenario has not been addressed, yet. Other filter
technologies allow for improved performance and thus keeping the Band 1
performance [9].
If operators would like to have NC CA between Band 1 and MSS spectrum, some
degradation of UE RF requirements could be needed depending on filter
technology. So our observation2 is follow
**Observation 2: For dual duplexer UE RF architecture, if the upper duplexer
is 2x50MHz or 2x70MHz, MOP and REFSENS can be kept within the 2x90MHz band. If
the upper duplexer is 2x90MHz, MOP and REFSENS may not be kept within the MSS
spectrum with current SAW filter technology, but other technology needs
further analysis.**
When we consider 70MHz + Band 1 duplexer combination, some disadvantages are
CA limitation for intra-band CA where first CC is located inside upper
duplexer and second CC is located in Band 1[6].
Thus, UE can only support intra-band CA and NC CA when CC1 and CC2 are located
inside the bandwidth of a new upper duplexer e.g. 70MHz, but other cases are
excluded.
That is our observation3 as follow
**Observation 3: When considering 2x50MHz or 2x70MHz as one of dual duplexer
BW, intra-band CA configuration is restricted by the pass band of upper
duplexer.**
# 6 General issues
This clause looks at the specific RF requirements for LTE UE deployment of
S-band in Korea and other applicable countries in Region 3. Consideration is
also given to the possibility of broader harmonization with Region 1.
## 6.1 Deployment scenarios
As illustrated in Figure 6.1-1, the new band under study is in the vicinity of
a number of other legacy bands already defined and possibly deployed or under
consideration for deployment in some parts of the world.\ Particularly
noteworthy is the relationship of the new band with that of Band 34 since this
presents the opportunity for UL/DL interference.
{width="5.720138888888889in" height="2.1in"}
Figure 6.1-1: Relationship of existing bands to the new band under study
Since there is no guard band between the uplink of the MSS band and Band 34
TDD, the coexistence requirements are challenging to be met without the
possibility of filter attenuation. Furthermore, it has been discussed that in
some countries, Band 34 will not be deployed and so the need to protect Band
34 does not exist.\ In other countries, Band 34 may be available for
deployment adjacent to the MSS band. To address different coexistence
protection requirements in different countries or different deployment
scenarios, NS signalling is a possible solution. For example, Band 26 was
defined to be a global band with possible deployment in several different
countries each with different coexistence requirements. Thus, NS_12, NS_13,
NS_14 and NS_15 have been defined for Band 26. There is a tradeoff, however,
between the number of NS values and tables defined and the flexibility and
optimization of requirements for any particular deployment. The goal is to
simultaneously minimize the number of NS values defined, yet maximize the
applicability of the band.
The following discrete scenarios have been identified for the 2 GHz MSS band:
● MSS band is allocated, but Band 34 is not;
● Band 34 is allocated, but the required protection level is still TBD;
● Band 34 is allocated. The required protection level is anticipated.
### 6.1.1 Deployment scenarios in Korea
To the E-UTRA terrestrial only or the combined for terrestrial and satellite
service in Korea, KCC proposed to study the feasibility in new frequency band
as in Table 6.1.1-1.
Table 6.1.1-1: LTE operating bands of S-Band

Figure 6.1.1-1: Frequency band for 2.1GHz terrestrial operation in Korea
Based on the band allocation, S-band UE can coexist with UEs of the legacy
operating bands such as Band 1, 3, 5, 8, 26 and 40 as shown in Figures 6.1.1-1
and 6.1.1-2. Considering the worst coexistence case between the S-Band UE and
legacy UE, it seems necessary to limit the interference into the legacy
downlink Band 1 from new S-band UE transmission.
Figure 6.1.1-2: Other operating bands for the potential UE-to-UE coexistence
study in Korea
Figure 6.1.1-2 shows other operating bands than Band 1 deployed in Korea, in
order to verify the potential UE-to-UE coexistence problems between the new
S-band and other operating bands.
## 6.2 S-Band UE-to-UE coexistence study
As described in subclause 6.1 on the 2 GHz MSS band deployment scenarios,
there are the following discrete scenarios:
● MSS band is allocated, but Band 34 is not;
● Band 34 is allocated, but the required protection level is still TBD;
● Band 34 is allocated. The required protection level is anticipated.
Each of these scenarios can be captured by utilizing NS signalling. For
example, the first scenario where Band 34 is not allocated in the same country
as the MSS band would not specify any UE coexistence requirements to protect
Band 34. This could be considered as the default UE behaviour. However, two NS
values for example could be defined for this band to correspond to the next
two scenarios. This method enables the same UE to operate in each of these
three scenarios, but to adjust its behaviour accordingly in order to provide
the greatest possibility of a harmonized design able to work in different
deployment scenarios for the benefits of larger scale and roaming.
In addition to the coexistence emission limits, some countermeasures may need
to be defined in order to enable the UE meeting the requirement. For example,
these may include A-MPR or uplink RB restrictions imposed on the MSS UE. These
are also expected to be associated with the NS value.
In this clause, the main aspect that needs to be addressed is the co-existence
of LTE UE of S-band to Band 1 UE as shown below in Figure 6.2-1
Figure 6.2-1: S-Band UE deployment scenarios for UE-to-UE coexistence
For this UE-to-UE co-existence, the deterministic approach and the UE RF
simulation approach based on band-specific RF component characteristics are
used to verify the feasibility.
### 6.2.1 Deterministic analysis for UE-to-UE coexistence
For the deterministic analysis, RAN4 assumes the following parameters:
● Antenna and body loss : maximum 8dB per person;
● Maximum Tx power : UE power class 3 (23dBm), consider MRP, A-MPR in Band 1;
● Channel model : Use Free space path loss model;
● UE to UE separation distance : ≤ 1m;
● Desense less than 3dB in static condition.
Based on the above assumption, the UE-to-UE spurious emission level using
Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) can be derived:
Required SE at Tx = allowed noise rise at Rx + MCL +penetration loss (Eq.
6.2.1-1)
The allowed noise rise at Rx is the estimated the interference level is
derived from Eq. 6.2.1-2, and\ the MCL level is derived from Eq. 6.2.1-3.
Allowed noise rise= -174dB/Hz + 60dB/Hz + 9dB(NF) = -105dBm/1MHz (Eq. 6.2.1-2)
MCL = path loss +Tx/Rx antenna gains = 38.44 + 8dB*2users = 54.44 dB (Eq.
6.2.1-3)
Where, path loss = 20*log10(fc[MHz])+20log10(d[m])-27.6 = 38.44dB,\ the
penetration loss is assumed to be 0dB between adjacent UEs.
By using deterministic analysis, it can be seen that the emission level is -
50.56dBm/1MHz, which is the same value as the conventional spurious emission
level in 3GPP TS 36.101 [4].
### 6.2.2 RF simulation based approach for UE-to-UE coexistence
#### 6.2.2.1 UE co-existence analysis to protect Band 1
The UL emission spectrum into Band 1 DL was simulated for single- and full-RB
allocations for 10, 15, and 20 MHz CBW. The simulation assumptions are as
follows:
■ Tx and Rx architecture: Conventional LTE Rel-8/9 UE;
■ Channel Bandwidth:
● 10MHz, 15MHz and 20MHz;
● No consideration of the CA scenarios.
■ Modulator impairments:
● I/Q imbalance: 25 dBc;
● Carrier leakage: 25 dBc;
● Counter IM3: 60dBc.
■ PA operating point: Pout = 22dBm when full RBs allocated in Rel-8 100RB
QPSK;
■ Noise Floor: -140dBm/Hz at the PA output;
■ Insertion loss: 3dB;
■ MPR/A-MPR: same value as used in Band 1;
■ Measurement BW: dBm/1MHz.

Figures 6.2.2.1-1A, B, C show the S-band UE Tx leakage levels into Band1 Rx UE
according to the channel bandwidth.
Figure 6.2.2.1-1C, shows that the Tx leakage level is maximum -65dBm/1MHz
which is the worst case in Band 1 UE. Since this value is below -50dBm/MHz,
there is no co-existence problem between S-band UE and Band 1 UE without any
discussion for duplexers.
#### 6.2.2.2 UE co-existence analysis to protect Band 34
##### 6.2.2.2.1 Summary results
The coexistence studies for Band 34 protection consider A-MPR or UL RB
restriction.\ In addition, PUCCH over-provisioning is also studied when A-MPR
is specified. A-MPR and UL RB restriction studies are included for different
emission protection levels for Band 34 (-50, -40, -30, and -15.5 dBm/MHz).\ In
addition, different frequency separations between the E-UTRA carrier edge and
the protected range are assumed. The required A-MPR simulation results are
summarized in Tables 6.2.2.2.1-1 and 6.2.2.2.1-2. For the Table 6.2.2.2.1-1,
the worst A-MPR values are chosen for each simulation cases from Annex A2.

#### 6.2.2.3 UE co-existence analysis to protect PHS band
##### 6.2.2.3.1 Summary results
For the PHS protection, RAN WG4 has specified NS_05 for Band 1 UE to protect
PHS band. However, lower Band 1 (1920--1940 MHz) regions had some RB
allocation restrictions as shown in figure 6.2.2.3.1-1. In order to maximize
efficiency of DL side, PUCCH overprovisioning was specified. However, still
lower Band 1 spectrum holder has been forced to discard UL spectra. Therefore,
introduction of new A-MPR scheme to utilize more UL spectra will be more
suitable for the new band.
A UE needs both the band number and NS value to be able to decode the maximum
A-MPR that it is allowed to apply. Both are signalled by the network in the
system information, wherein each NS value is associated with a frequency band
indicator (e.g. 1 or 65) in multi-band signalling. This combination of NS+band
number message allows for the use of the same NS value for several E-UTRA
operating bands with specific A-MPR values per operating band. Thus, NS_05 can
be associated to Band 1 as well as Band 65 since the same emissions
requirement to protect PHS band is indicated for both these frequency ranges.

In above figure 6.2.2.3.1-1, utilization of UL spectrum with the same network
signaled value (NS_05) is shown for the lower part of Band 1 and Band 65.
Table 6.2.2.3.1-1 is the summary of A-MPR study results to protect PHS Band
according to the each channel bandwidths and each guard band [7][8][9][10].

#### 6.2.2.4 UE co-existence analysis to protect Band 33/Band 39
##### 6.2.2.4.1 Summary results
For protection of B33/B39, RAN4 need further discussion to define UE-to-UE
coexistence with different approach for Band 1 legacy UE. In the previous
analysis of Band 1 UE coexistence requirements, TDD-FDD coexistence approach
without A-MPR had applied in TS36.101. However, it also can be defined the UE
coexistence requirements with A-MPR using NS_xx or make a guard band as same
approach to Band 34 protection.
We propose UE coexistence analysis results [9] in Table 6.2.2.4.1-1 to protect
B33/B39 UE for MSS band UE.

# 7 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
For the S-band UE channel arrangements, RAN4 agreed to study the restricted
channel arrangements as follows:
● UL: (2010 -- X) to 2010 MHz, DL: (2200 -- X) to 2200 MHz;
● 30 MHz ≦ X ≦ 70 with 10 MHz step;
● The channel arrangement for the fully overlapped with Band 1 is not a
candidate band due to the duplexer characteristics.
The channel arrangement for X = 30 is the same as the one originally proposed
in the SID RP-121420 [5].
## 7.1 UE Tx RF requirements
### 7.1.1 Spurious emission for UE co-existence
When S-band UE is allocated in the same country and region where Band 34 UE is
deployed, RAN4 can define network signalling to apply A-MPR mask with guard
band to protect Band 34 for S-band UE.\ SE requirements for UE-to-UE
coexistence can be defined as in Table 7.1.1-1.\ The SE requirements level to
protect Band 34 is guaranteed due to the use of Band 1 duplexer. As presented
in 6.2.2.2.1, PHS protection level is also guaranteed when the upper edge of
the channel bandwidth frequency is greater than 1980MHz. Otherwise, NS_05 for
Band 1 is reused for Band 65.

Note that when the E-UTRA carrier is within 1920-1980 MHz, Band 34 protection
is fulfilled by filtering rejection and thus the requirement can be added in
the UE spurious emissions for UE co-existence table; see Table 7.1.1-1 above.
## 7.2 UE RX Requirements
### 7.2.1 REFSENS requirements for S-band UE
New S-band has the same Tx-Rx frequency separation and the total pass
bandwidth of S-band. It is similar with Band 1. Therefore S-band UE\'s REFSENS
level can be easily as assumed to be the same as that of Band 1.\ RF
simulations are provided to verify this assumption.
Figure 7.2.1-1 shows the simulation results of emission level in S-band DL
lower bands when considering 20MHz channel BW with full UL RB allocation in
upper edge of UL frequency. The red line indicates the leakage level in S-Band
DL lower band.

Figure 7.2.1-1: Simulation results of the Tx leakage level into S-band DL
The leakage level in DL band is about -75dBm/MHz, which is further attenuated
by Duplexer Tx/Rx isolation level, which is assumed to be 50dB. So the leakage
level in DL band is estimated as -125dBm/MHz, which is 18 dB lower than
REFSENS. Eq. 7-1 shows the impact of REFSENS in S-band DL induced by S-band Tx
leakage.
\- REFSENS for S-band UE = Conventional REFSENS + Tx_leakage levels **(Eq.
7-1)**

>
> = -107dBm/MHz + -125dBm/MHz = - 106.93dBm/MHz;
>
> = -93.93dBm/CBW.
From Eq. 7-1, it can be seen that the REFSENS in own Rx band by Tx leakage is
negligible.
The final REFSENS is still TBD depending on the channel arrangement.

###### ### Annex A: A-MPR simulation results to protect Band 34
# A.1 simulation assumptions
When Band 34 and S-band are deployed in the same region, the UE-to-UE
coexistence needs to be analyzed to protect Band 34 from S-band. RF
simulations are performed on this issue considering 4 different protection
levels from -50dBm/MHz to -30dBm/MHz with 10dB step and -15.5dBm/5MHz.
For the A-MPR simulation, we assume the Duplexer filter attenuation is 0dB to
protect Band 34 regardless S-band channel arrangements. And additional
simulation assumptions are as follow
\- Modulation schemes : QPSK and 16-QAM
\- ACLR requirements for E-UTRA and UTRA in TS36.101
\- General SE/SEM for E-UTRA in TS36.101.
\- Guard band to protect Band 34
■ 0MHz, 5MHz and 10MHz ( in S-band upper edge)
\- UE-to-UE coexistence requirements
■ General UE coexistence : -50, -40, -30 dBm/MHz and -15.5dBm/5MHz
For the guard-band, we only consider that GB is allocated in upper edge of
S-band UL frequency since 3GPP always study and analyze to protect the legacy
operating bands in same regions when new operating bands are deployed and
specified in TS 36.101.
