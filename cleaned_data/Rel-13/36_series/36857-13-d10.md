# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply.\ A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1] and the following apply.\ An abbreviation defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR
21.905 [1].
# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 5DL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-13 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS side. The
document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination).
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
present document, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the
rapporteur of each WI to ensure that the TPs related to the WI have been
implemented.

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [2] when
operating in single carrier mode.
#### 6.1.1.2 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/5 DL
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting
CA_1A-3A-19A-42C follow from those derived for the constituent 2DL and 3DL CA
fall-back modes, which have been analysed and captured in [3], [4] and [5].
#### 6.1.1.3 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.1.1.3-1.
Table 6.1.1.3-1: ΔT~IB,c~ for 5DLs aggregation

* * *
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configuration in
Table 6.1.1.3-2 with uplink in one E-UTRA band, the minimum requirement for
reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.1-1 (TS 36.101) shall be increased by the
amount given in ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 6.1.1.3-2.

#### 6.1.1.4 MSD
For this combination, two MSD requirements should be specified. One is
degradation of Band 3 DL from Band 1 UL due to narrow frequency separation
between the Band 1 UL and Band 3 DL. The other is degradation of Band 42 DL
due to the 2nd order harmonics generated by Band 3 UL. For this 5DL
combination, it is reasonable to specify the same MSD requirements as
CA_1A-3A-19A-42A since no additional challenges are required due to additional
Band 42 DL. The former MSD is specified in Table 6.1.1.4-1 and 6.1.1.4-2, and
the latter is specified in Table 6.1.1.4-3 and 6.1.1.4-4.

> Nevertheless, it has been assumed this does not make a significant

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [2] when
operating in single carrier mode.
#### 6.4.1.2 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/5 DL
A co-existence study is already done for CA_3A-7A-28A in TR 36.853-13 [6]. It
has also been agreed that no additional BS study of 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics
and IMD products will be required for a 4DL CA configuration, if it does not
use a larger carrier channel bandwidth or aggregated channel bandwidth in any
of the CA bands when compared to the constituent 3 DL CA configurations\".
This logic can also be applied to a 5DL combination with the same bands,
therefore there are no co-existence studies done for this CA combination.
#### 6.4.1.3 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~
For the UE which supports CA_3C-7C-28A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined
for applicable bands in Table 6.4.1.3-1 and 6.4.1.3-2 respectively. All these
values are derived from the CA_3A-7A-28A in TS 36.101 [2]

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configuration in
Table 6.4.1.3-2 with uplink in one E-UTRA band, the minimum requirement for
reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.1-1 (TS 36.101) shall be increased by the
amount given in ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 6.4.1.3-2.
