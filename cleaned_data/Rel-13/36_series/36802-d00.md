## 4.1 Work item objective
**The objective is to specify a radio access for cellular internet of things,
based to a great extent on a non-backward-compatible variant of E-UTRA, that
addresses improved indoor coverage, support for massive number of low
throughput devices, low delay sensitivity, ultra low device cost, low device
power consumption and (optimised) network architecture.**
NB-IOT should support 3 different modes of operation:
1\. 'Stand-alone operation' utilizing for example the spectrum currently being
used by GERAN systems as a replacement of one or more GSM carriers, as well as
scattered spectrum for potential IoT deployment.
2\. 'Guard band operation' utilizing the unused resource blocks within a LTE
carrier's guard-band
3\. 'In-band operation' utilizing resource blocks within a normal LTE carrier
**In particular, the following will be supported:**
  * **180 kHz UE RF bandwidth for both downlink and uplink**
  * **OFDMA on the downlink**
    * **15 kHz sub-carrier spacing for all the modes of operation > (with normal or extended CP).**
  * **For the uplink:**
    * **Single tone transmissions are supported. Two numerologies > should be configurable by the network for single-tone > transmission: 3.75 kHz and 15 kHz. A cyclic prefix is > inserted. Frequency domain sinc pulse-shaping in the physical > layer description.**
    * **Multi-tone transmissions are supported, based on SC-FDMA with > 15 kHz UL subcarrier spacing.**
    * **FFS: Additional mechanisms for PAPR reduction.**
    * **The UE shall indicate the support single-tone and/or > multi-tone, details to be discussed by RAN WGs**
  * An NB-IoT UE only needs to support half duplex operations
  * **A single synchronization signal design for the different modes of > operation, including techniques to handle overlap with legacy LTE > signals**
  * **MAC, RLC, PDCP and RRC procedures based on existing LTE procedures > and protocols and relevant optimisations to support the selected > physical layer**
  * **Any enhancements to S1 interface to CN and related radio protocols > to support the work SA2 is conducting on the systems aspects such > as signalling reduction for small data transmissions.**
**The detailed objectives are:**
  * **RAN1 to specify the physical layer aspects, covering:**
    * **Physical channel and mapping of transport channels**
    * **Channel coding and physical channel mapping**
    * **Physical layer procedures**
    * **Physical layer measurements**
    * **UE physical layer capabilities**
  * **RAN2 to specify the following radio protocol aspects:**
    * **The radio interface protocol architecture**
    * **MAC, RLC, PDCP, and RRC protocols**
    * **UE capabilities**
  * **RAN3 to specify changes to existing S1 interface**
  * RAN4 to specify core requirements (when needed) to allow for > "standalone" "in guard band operation" and "in-band operation" > in specific bands (depending on operator input) as follows:
    * UE radio transmission and reception
    * Base Station radio transmission and reception
    * UE and Base Station Requirements for support of Radio Resource > Management**For the stand-alone operation, specify RF > requirements to meet (a) GSM mask relevant for NB-IoT or (b) > MSR spectral mask depending on the BS operational > configuration.**
    * **For the guard band operation, specify RF requirements for > adjacent / non-adjacent co-existence with LTE in the guard > band.**
    * **For the in-band operation, specify RF requirements for > adjacent channel coexistence with another LTE carrier and > specify RF requirements for in-band co-existence with LTE.**
  * **The following bands shall be considered with high priority for defining any RAN4 band specific requirement within Release 13:**
    * **Bands 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 26, 28**
    * **Note if there are other bands not having significant specific issues and there is consensus in RAN4, these could be considered as well**
  * **Whether one or multiple bands are supported in a device is a UE implementation issue**
**The overall system description will be documented in a stage 2 functional
specification.**
**The interface to the core network will be an optimised interface discussed
in SA2 as part of FS_AE_CIOT.**
**Conformance testing will be described in a subsequent work item.**
NOTE: The present document only cover part study of the work item on NB-IoT
which is related to RAN4 work.
# 5 Frequency bands and channel arrangement
## 5.1 General
## 5.2 Operating bands
Existing E-UTRA bands are used for NB-IOT. NB-IOT operating bands sub-clause
lists bands that RAN has agreed to be used for NB-IoT and refers to E-UTRA
band definition clause 5.5 where the bands are defined in detail.
Note that this does not mean precluding defining bands specific to NB-IoT in
future.
NB-IOT is designed to operate in the operating bands defined in Table 5.2-1.

Figure 5.3-1 shows the relation between the NB-IoT channel bandwidth
(BW~Channel~) and the NB-IoT transmission bandwidth configuration (N~tone~).
The channel edges are defined as the lowest and highest frequencies of the
carrier separated by the channel bandwidth, i.e. at F~C~ +/- BW~Channel~ /2.

## 5.4 Channel arrangement
### 5.4.1 Channel spacing
Channel spacing for standalone NB-IOT is 200 kHz. For in-band and guard band
cases are FFS.
### 5.4.2 Channel raster
Channel raster for in, guard and standalone NB-IOT is 100 kHz.
### 5.4.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN for NB-IoT
The carrier frequency of NB-IoT in the downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 \-- 262143 and
the Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN in the range
{-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,-0.5,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The relation
between EARFCN, Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN and the carrier
frequency in MHz for the downlink is given by the following equation, where
F~DL~ is the downlink carrier frequency of NB-IoT, F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~
are given in table 5.7.3-1, N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN, M~DL~ is the Offset
of NB-IoT Channel Number to downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~) + 0.0025*(2M~DL~+1)
The carrier frequency of NB-IoT in the uplink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 \--262143 and
the Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN in the range
{-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The relation between
EARFCN, Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN and the carrier frequency in
MHz for the uplink is given by the following equation, where F~UL~ is the
uplink carrier frequency of NB-IoT, F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1, N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN, M~UL~ is the Offset of NB-IoT
Channel Number to uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~) + 0.0025*(2M~UL~)
NOTE 1: For NB-IoT, N~DL~ or N~UL~ is different than the value of EARFCN that
corresponds to E-UTRA downlink or uplink carrier frequency for in-band and
guard band operation.
NOTE 2: For stand-alone operation, only M~DL~ = -0.5 and M~UL~= 0 are
applicable. M~DL~ = -0.5 is not applicable for in-band and guard band
operation.
### 5.4.4 TX--RX frequency separation for NB-IoT
For NB-IoT in in-band or guard-band operation, TX-RX frequency separation is
flexible within the limits of the TX-RX frequency separation of the E-UTRA
carriers as specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 36.101. For stand-alone operation
mode the TX-RX frequency separation is the same as table 5.7.4-1 of 36.101.
# 6 System scenarios
## 6.1 Coexistence simulation cases
Simulation cases for evaluating coexistence study for NB-IoT are described in
this section. Scenarios for coexistence evaluations include the following
operation modes,
  * \- Stand-alone operation
  * \- Guard band operation
  * \- In-band operation
For the stand-alone operation mode, coexistence between NB-IoT and legacy
LTE/UMTS/GSM systems need studied both for the downlink and the uplink.
For the guard band and in-band operation modes, coexistence between NB-IoT and
legacy LTE system need studied only for the uplink, considering the downlink
sub-carrier of NB-IoT is orthogonal with LTE PRB and both are transmitting
from the same BS.
The simulation cases for the above scenarios are given in Table 6.1-1

## 6.3 Coexistence simulation methodology
For the stand-alone operation mode, snap-shot based Monte-Carlo system level
simulation is used. Legacy ACIR model which calculated by ACLR and ACS is
valid for this scenario. The simulation methodology consists of four steps as
follows,
â€¢ First step for UL and DL
â€¢ Assume LTE ACLR is flat on the adjacent 10MHz channel
â€¢ Assume LTE ACS is flat on the adjacent 10MHz channel
â€¢ Assume NB-IoT ACLR is flat on the adjacent 10MHz
â€¢ Assume NB-IoT ACS is flat on the adjacent 10MHz
â€¢ Get simulation results
â€¢ Second step for DL and [UL]
â€¢ Compute NB-IoT ACLR according to GSM mask
â€¢ Apply the GSM ACS to NB-IoT
â€¢ Get results from the first step, based on the calculated NB-IoT ACLR and ACS
â€¢ If the result is too pessimistic, go to step 3.
â€¢ If the result of NB-IoT performance is too optimistic, go to step 4.
â€¢ Third step
â€¢ Need email discussion to find out more appropriate way to handle ACLR and
ACS, and re-do simulations
â€¢ Fourth step
â€¢ Need email discussion to find out more appropriate way to handle LTE ACLR,
and re-do simulations
Additional information on ACLR and ACS is shown as follows,
â€¢ Definition and assumption
â€¢ LTE ACLR and ACS are defined for its own bandwidth size
â€¢ NB-IoT ACLR and ACS are defined for its own bandwidth size
â€¢ Attenuations are flat in the adjacent 10 MHz
â€¢ ACLR and ACS are the inputs to the simulations
â€¢ ACLR_e is the effective ACLR in the interference calculation
â€¢ ACS_e is the effective ACS in the interference calculation
â€¢ Interference from LTE to NB-IoT
â€¢ ACLR_e = ACLR -- 10*log10((180kHz/(# of IoT users))/9MHz)
â€¢ ACS_e = ACS [pessimistic assumption]
â€¢ Interference from NB-IoT to LTE
â€¢ ACLR_e = ACLR -- 10*log10((9MHz/(# of LTE users))/180kHz) [pessimistic
assumption]
â€¢ ACS_e = ACS
â€¢ The effective ACLR (ACLR_e) and effective ACS (ACS_e) shall be applied in
the coexistence simulation for the calculation of victim system interference

Figure 6.3-1 Illustration of flat assumption of ACLR and ACS
For the guard band and in-band operation modes, the simulation methodology
consists of three steps as follows,
â€¢ First step
â€¢ Computing the amount of power leakage:
\- From NB-IoT to the N-th adjacent LTE PRBs.
\- From LTE to NB-IoT.
This step does not involve Monte-Carlo simulation.
â€¢ Second step
â€¢ Use system level Monte-Carlo simulation to compute:
\- the SINR distribution at n-th adjacent LTE PRB
\- SINR distribution for NB-IoT users
â€¢ Third step
â€¢ Determining the degradation:
\- LTE throughput degradation due to NB-IoT
\- NB-IoT degradation
For the first step, the power leakage between NB-IoT and LTE can be computed
following the approach as follows:
â€¢ For DL simulation
â€¢ There is no need to perform this study
â€¢ For UL simulation
â€¢ For 3.75KHz for single tone filtering needs to be considered
â€¢ For 15 KHz for both single and multi-tones transmission, companies are
encouraged to study the impact of the introduction on co-existence.
â€¢ The power leakage needs to be specified
â€¢ For LTE as victim, a function of n-th adjacent PRB
â€¢ For NB-IoT as victim, the granularity is per subcarrier spacing
â€¢ Filter assumptions:
â€¢ Refer to RAN1 agreement. In case, RAN1 does not have it, filter
characteristic needs to be agreed by email discussion
For the second step, LTE PRB SINR and NB-IoT SINR distribution are obtained
through Monte-Carlo system level simulation methodology and power leakage
computed in Step1.
For the third step,
â€¢ The computation of LTE throughput degradation, i.e. how to map PRB level
SINR, to user level SINR is FFS
The computation of NB-IoT degradation (e.g. Outage) is FFS.

### 6.4.13 Intermediary Conclusion
The criteria captured in Table 6.4.13-1 have been used to conclude on NB-IoT
standalone coexistence study with LTE, UMTS and GSM. Those criteria are those
usually used for similar coexistence studies. For NB-IoT, such criteria has
never been specified as this is the first time such study has been performed.
Table 6.4.13-1: Criteria for coexistence evaluation
* * *
RAT Criteria LTE Throughput degradation less than 5% for 5%-ile and average
UMTS Outage less or equal to 5% GSM Outage less or equal to 5% NB-IoT Average
of SNR value loss is less or equal to 1 dB
* * *
Based on those criteria, from companies' outputs collected previously in
6.4.1.1 and 6.4.1.2, we could conclude on the following Table 6.4.13-2.
Table6.4.13-2: Coexistence results

### 6.4.14 UEM masks
For the Base Station, as agreed in WF R4-161289, the UEM mask is based on MSR
table 6.6.2.2-2 with Foffset,RAT=200 kHz. An equivalent ACLR from this mask
would have 48-50 dB value.
For the UE, several UEM masks are under investigation, but achievable power
ration has been evaluated in following Table 6.4.14-1:
Table 6.4.14-1: Achievable power ration for UE candidate masks
* * *
Protection over the 200kHz channel with edge to edge frequency offset 100kHz\
500kHz\ 580kHz\ (with GSM) (with LTE) (with UMTS)
(reference) GSM 36dB 60dB 60dB
LTE like [1] 18dB 55dB 55dB
GSM like [2] 26dB 50dB 50dB
* * *
### 6.4.15 Conclusion
By comparing the values from the coexistence studies with the achievable power
ratio for the considered masks for BS and UE (Table 6.4.15-1), we can conclude
on the following:
NB-IoT can co-exist with LTE, UMTS and GSM.

### 6.4.20 Background and conclusion
The power leakage modeling data with same granularity from different companies
are not totally same (e.g. with/without filtering). The simulation results
from different companies are based on their own power leakage model. Power
leakage model is somehow dependent on implementation (e.g. filtering), sinc-
shaped pulse filter could be regarded as the worst case. _Comment: Not sure
this difference could really explain all results' differences: we all have
similar power leakage, but still, simulations results are not converging._
NB-IoT can coexist with LTE in-band and guard band with the observations as
follows,
â€¢ NB-IoT perform some interference on 1st adjacent LTE PRB, while the
interference on other PRBs is insignificant or acceptable.
â€¢ Some impact on NB-IoT at high SNR.
â€¢ Guard band operation perform slightly better coexistence compared to in-band
operation.
# 7 Study of BS requirements
NB-IoT base station requirements shall be introduced in TS 36.104 for all
three operation modes which is described in section 4.1. In addition, for the
case NB-IoT carrier in three operation modes mixed with other RAT carriers,
base station requirements shall also be introduced in TS 37.104 for Multi-
Standard Radio specification.
This section gives the technical analysis on each BS RF requirements for both
TS 36.104 and TS 37.104.
## 7.1 Transmitter characteristics
### 7.1.1 General
### 7.1.2 Base station output power
Base station output power specifies some power related definitions, BS rated
output power for each BS class and the accuracy of BS maximum output power
relative to the rated output power declared by manufacturer. There are in
addition regional requirements for output powers that can be declared and
three single-RAT requirements.
For NB-IoT BS, BS class definitions and maximum output power accuracy
requirements should reuse BS class definitions and maximum output power
accuracy requirements of LTE BS regardless of NB-IoT operation modes. In
addition, for NB-IoT in-band and guard band operation, NB-IoT carrier and LTE
carrier should share the LTE carrier output power and this should be clarified
in the specification in TS 36.104. The corresponding clause in TS 37.104 can
be kept unchanged.
### 7.1.3 Output power dynamics
#### 7.1.3.1 Power boosting of NB-IoT carrier in LTE in-band/guard band
operation
The power boosting requirement of NB-IoT carrier is on the ratio of power of
NB-IoT carrier which occupies a PRB of LTE carrier in-band or 180kHz in guard
band, compared with the average power over all carrier (both LTE and NB-IoT).
Minimum requirements of NB-IoT carrier power boosting except guard-band
operation mode with 1.4/3/5 MHz CBW is +6dB. In Rel-13, only one PRB is
allowed to be boosted 6dB for in-band operation mode, and guard band operation
mode with 10/15/20 MHz CBW. For guard-band operation mode with 5 MHz CBW, in
Release 13 it is decided manufacturer can declare any power boosting level
which BS can perform, while in Release 14 specific boosting level may be
specified. Guard-band operation mode with 1.4/3 MHz CBW is FFS. In case of
guard band operation the NB-IoT power boosted PRB should be placed adjacent to
the LTE PRB edge as close as possible (i.e., away from edge of system
bandwidth).
This new requirement should be introduced in both TS 36.104 and TS 37.104.
### 7.1.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
The requirements are only applied for TDD BS. In Rel-13 NB-IoT, only FDD BS is
included so the requirements are not related to Rel-13 NB-IoT BS.
### 7.1.5 Transmitted signal quality
#### 7.1.5.1 Error Vector Magnitude
QPSK is the baseline modulation scheme for NB-IoT carrier and 16QAM is still
FFS in RAN1. For the same modulation scheme, the EVM requirement for NB-IoT
carrier should also be the same as existing LTE requirement. Therefore, this
clause should be clarified for NB-IoT in both TS 36.104 and TS 37.104.
The EVM measurement shall be performed for each NB-IoT carrier over all
allocated sub-channels and downlink subframes within 10ms measurement periods.
The boundaries of the EVM measurement periods need not be aligned with radio
frame boundaries. The EVM value is then calculated as the mean square root of
the measured values. The EVM of each NB-IoT carrier for different modulation
schemes on NB-PDSCH shall be better than the limits in table 7.1.5.1-1:
Table 7.1.5.1-1: EVM requirements
* * *
**Modulation scheme for NB-PDSCH** **Required EVM [%]** QPSK 17.5 %
* * *
#### 7.1.5.2 Frequency error
Frequency error is a measure of the difference between the actual BS transmits
frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be used for RF
frequency and data clock generation.
Frequency error requirement for NB-IoT base station should reuse LTE BS
requirement regardless of which operation modes the NB-IoT base station is
apply. Therefore, this clause in both TS 36.104 and TS 37.104 can be kept
unchanged.
#### 7.1.5.3 Time alignment error
Time Alignment Error (TAE) is defined as the largest timing difference between
any two signals for TX diversity, MIMO transmission, carrier aggregation and
their combinations.
For NB-IoT, SFBC is agreed to be used for 2DL antenna ports in RAN1, time
alignment error requirement for TX diversity transmissions should also be
reused for SFBC. Therefore, this clause should be clarified for NB-IoT in both
TS 36.104 and TS 37.104.
#### 7.1.5.4 DL NRS power
For NB-IoT, DL NRS power is the resource element power of the Downlink Narrow-
band Reference Signal.
The absolute DL NRS power is indicated on the DL-SCH. The absolute accuracy is
defined as the maximum deviation between the DL NRS power indicated on the DL-
SCH and the DL NRS power of each NB-IoT carrier at the BS antenna connector.
DL NRS power of each NB-IoT carrier should be within Â± 2.1 dB of the DL NRS
power indicated on the DL-SCH
### 7.1.6 Unwanted emissions
#### 7.1.6.1 Occupied bandwidth
For in band operation the occupied bandwidth for LTE and NB-IoT should be less
than the channel bandwidth of LTE carrier.
For guard band operation in LTE carrier of CBW > 3MHz, the occupied bandwidth
for LTE and NB-IoT should be less than the channel bandwidth of LTE carrier.
For guard band operation in LTE carrier of CBW =1.4/3 MHz, the occupied
bandwidth for LTE and NB-IoT is FFS.
For standalone operation the occupied bandwidth is 200kHz.
#### 7.1.6.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
For in band or guard band, LTE and NB-IoT shall fulfill ACLR requirements as
defined in TS 36.104.
For NB-IoT standalone operation, a 2 steps ACLR is specified from 200 kHz
offset from NB-IoT, according to Figure 7.1.6.2-1. The ACLR shall be higher
than the value specified in in Table 7.1.6.2-1.
Figure 7.1.6.2-1: ACLR for NB-IoT standalone

NOTE 1: BW~Config~ is the transmission bandwidth configuration of the E-UTRA

* * *
#### 7.1.6.3 Operating band unwanted emissions
For NB-IoT in band operation, LTE unwanted emission mask requirements should
be reused.
For NB-IoT guard band operation in LTE carrier of CBW > 5MHz, LTE unwanted
emission mask requirements should be reused.
Unless otherwise stated, for NB-IoT standalone operation and MSR operation
with NB-IoT as the outermost carrier of RF bandwidth, existing MSR UEM
requirement specified in clause 6.6.2.2 of TS 37.104 for BC2 operation is
reused for all operating bands using the same Foffset, RAT value for NB-IoT as
for GSM.
An exception is for BS that only supports E-UTRA and NB-IoT multi-carrier
operation, the existing E-UTRA Category A and Category B Option 1 masks should
be kept as an option only for Rel-8 E-UTRA BS upgrade.
At the same time, band category in TS 37.104 should also be revised for NB-IoT
as:
\- Band Category 1 (BC1): Bands for E-UTRA FDD and UTRA FDD operation. Bands
in this category are also used for NB-IoT operation (all modes)
\- Band Category 2 (BC2): Bands for E-UTRA FDD, UTRA FDD, and GSM/EDGE
operation. Bands in this category are also used for NB-IoT operation (all
modes)
Frequency offset **F~offset\ ~** from the Lowest and Highest Carriers to the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and sub-block edges (if any) is defined in
Table7.1.6.3-1 for NB-IoT.

**RAT** **F~offset,\ RAT~** Standalone NB-IoT 200 kHz

#### 7.1.6.4 Transmitter spurious emissions
The spurious emission requirement in LTE and MSR specification can be reused
for NB-IoT.
### 7.1.7 Transmitter intermodulation
For NB-IoT in band operation, existing LTE transmitter intermodulation
requirements should be reused.
For NB-IoT guard band operation in LTE carrier of CBW > 5MHz, existing LTE
transmitter intermodulation requirement should be reused
For NB-IoT standalone operation compliance with TS 36.104, intermodulation
requirement as specified in clause 6.7.1 in TS 36.104 should be reused.
For NB-IoT standalone operation compliance with TS 37.104, intermodulation
requirement as specified in clause 6.7.1 in TS 37.104 should be reused for
BC1bands, and intermodulation requirement as specified in clause 6.7.1 and
6.7.2 in TS 37.104 should be reused for BC2 bands.
## 7.2 Receiver characteristics
### 7.2.1 Reference sensitivity level
The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power
received at the antenna connector at which a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel.
The methodology to derive reference sensitivity power level PREFSENS is as
follows,
> PREFSENS = -174+10*log10(BW) + NF + IM + SNR
Where,
â€¢ BW is the transmission bandwidth in Hz,
â€¢ NF is the receiver noise figure in dB, for wide area base station, NF = 5,
â€¢ IM is implementation margin in dB, for low MCS in REFSENS, IM = 2,
â€¢ SNR in dB to meet the 95% of maximum throughput under fixed reference
channel (FRC) without any repetition
Reference sensitivity requirement for NB-IoT should be specified for single-
tone transmission of both 3.75kHz and 15kHz. The parameter configuration of
reference measurement channel and the corresponding simulation results are
listed in following table 7.2.1-1.
Table 7.2.1-1 FRC parameters and simulation results for base station reference
sensitivity
* * *
Reference channel A12-2 A12-1 Sub carrier spacing (kHz) 3.75 15 Number of tone

number of bits per resource unit 96 96 Tx time (ms) 64 16 Required SNR (dB)
-2.0 -2.1
* * *
Then reference sensitivity levels for NB-IoT are specified in Table 7.2.1-2.
Table 7.2.1-2: Wide Area BS reference sensitivity levels for NB-IoT
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | Reference measurement channel | Reference sensitivity power level, PREFSENS | | | | | | [dBm] | +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | FRC A12-1 | -127.3 | +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | FRC A12-2 | -133.3 | +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
### 7.2.2 Dynamic Range
The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the receiver
to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal inside the
received channel bandwidth. The interfering signal level inside the received
channel bandwidth is expressed as Iot (Interference over thermal) and can
reuse LTE requirement of 20dB for NB-IoT.
For standalone operation, the interfering signal level and wanted signal level
are:
The parameters for the reference measurement channels are listed in Table
7.2.2-1 for dynamic range. The required SNR for this FRC is 4.8 dB for both
3.75kHz and 15kHz according to the simulation results. Implementation margin
for high MCS of NB-IoT can also reuse 2.5dB in LTE.
Table 7.2.2-1 FRC parameters for dynamic range for NB-IoT
* * *
Reference channel A13-2 A13-1 Sub carrier spacing (kHz) 3.75 15 Number of tone
1 1 Modulation Ï€/4 QPSK Ï€/4 QPSK IMCS / ITBS 7 / 7 7 / 7 Payload size (bits)

Number of code blocks -- C 1 1 Total symbols per resource unit 96 96 Total
number of bits per resource unit 192 192 Tx time (ms) 32 8
* * *
Then dynamic range requirement for NB-IoT is specified in Table 7.2.2-2.
Table 7.2.2-2: Wide Area BS dynamic range
* * *
Reference measurement channel Wanted signal mean power [dBm] Interfering
signal mean power [dBm] / BW~Channel~ Type of interfering signal FRC A13-1
-99.7 -96 AWGN FRC A13-2 -105.6 -96 AWGN
* * *
For in-band and guard band operation, wanted signal power should still use the
value in Table 7.2.2-2. The interfering signal AWGN bandwidth in LTE
requirements needs to be extended from current Transmission bandwidth
configuration () to channel bandwidth () to cover the guard band operation.
### 7.2.3 In-channel selectivity
In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to receive a
wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the presence of an
interfering signal received at a larger power spectral density. The
interfering signal can reuse LTE requirement of 16QAM E-UTRA signal.
For in-band operation only, ICS requirement is specified. Same _P~inf~_ as LTE
requirement can be reused.
Same FRC and SNR as REFSENS can be reused.
Interfering signal is placed in one side of the Fc, while the NB-IoT PRB is
placed on the other side, at its middle. The wanted NB-IoT tone is placed at
the centre of this NB-IoT PRB.

### 7.2.4 ACS/Blocking
Co-existence simulations are performed between NB-IoT and GSM/UMTS/LTE
systems. These simulation results in [2] can be the reference to define
ACS/blocking requirements.
ACS/ In-band blocking definition for standalone operation is summarized in
Table 7.2.4-1. The interfering signal type for ACS can be 200 kHz NB-IoT
signal. Wide ACS interfering signal like LTE and UMTS has no need to be
defined because narrow ACS interfering signal is enough according to co-
existence simulation. Blocker signal can reuse that in LTE and MSR
requirements. Wanted signal desensitivity for ACS and In-band blocking
requirements are +19.5dB and +6dB respectively.
Table 7.2.4-1 ACS/Blocking requirement for standalone operation
* * *
Wanted signal Interfering signal ACS/Interfering signal level frequency offset
between RF bandwidth edge and interfering signal center frequency Wanted
signal desensitivity Note Standalone NB-IoT in 36.104 200kHz NB-IoT -52dBm
_+/-_ 100kHz +19.5 dB ACS 5MHz LTE -43 dBm _+/-_ 7.5MHz +6 dB In-band blocking
Standalone NB-IoT in 37.104 5M UTRA -40 dBm +/- 7.5 MHz +6 dB In-band blocking
* * *
For in-band and guard band operation, ACS/Blocking interfering signal level
can reuse that in existing LTE requirement and MSR requirement. NB-IoT
interfering signal could be unnecessary to be defined because co-existence
simulation is already approved it will be durable for LTE carrier. The
desensitivity for ACS and in-band blocking requirement is still +6dB. The
desensitivity for guard band operation is 10 dB, 8 dB, 6 dB and 6 dB for 5
MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz and 20 MHz channel bandwidth respectively.
For standalone operation, MSR narrow band blocking interfering signal level
and frequency offset can be reused, i.e. 3 MHz LTE is always considered as
interferer. Wanted signal desensitivity for narrow band blocking requirement
is +12dB.
For in band and guard band operation, interfering signal level and frequency
offset can reuse that in existing LTE requirement and MSR requirement. Wanted
signal desensitivitty is summarized in Table 7.2.4-2.
Table 7.2.4-2 Narrow band blocking for in band and guard band operation

6 15 6 6 20 6 6 Guard band 5 11 13 10 6 6 15 6 6 20 6 6
* * *
For out of band blocking, it is proposed to use a continuous wave signal as
interferer. The mean power of interfering signal should be -15 dBm.
Additional blocking requirements for co-location with other base stations in
LTE and MSR specification can be reused for NB-IoT standalone and in-
band/guard band operation.
### 7.2.5 Receiver spurious emission
Existing RX spurious emission requirement comes from the regulation, so it can
be reused for NB-IoT in both 36.104 and 37.104.
### 7.2.6 Receiver intermodulation
Text will be added
# 8 Study of UE requirements
## 8.1 Transmitter characteristics
### 8.1.1 Agreements
â€¢ At least Maximum output power classes 3 (23 dBm) is specified for NB-IOT.
\- Also power class 5 (20dBm) is specified for NB-IoT .
â€¢ Frequency error is specified to be Â±0.1 PPM observed over a period of one
time slot compared to the carrier frequency received from the NB-IOT BS
â€¢ NB-IOT UE to UE co-ex clause refers back to E-UTRA requirement
â€¢ Occupied bandwidth shall be less than NB-IOT channel bandwidth i.e. 200 kHz
\- Follows the decision on NB-IOT channel bndwidth discussion
â€¢ E-UTRA General ON/OFF time mask can be re-used for NB-IOT
â€¢ E-UTRA QPSK EVM requirement 17.5% can be re-used for multitone Unrotated
QPSK NB-IOT
### 8.1.2 EVM
#### 8.1.2.1 Single tone rotated pi/4 QPSK EVM
EVM for single tone rotated pi/4 QPSK and multi tone unrotated QPSK should be
the same because noise margin in both constellations is the same, see Figure
below.
#### 8.1.2.2 Single tone rotated pi/2 BPSK EVM
In theory EVM requirement for rotated pi/2 BPSK could be 3 dB higher compared
to pi/4 QPSK if all relevant transmitter assumptios are same. See Figure
8.1.2.2-1 where BPSK and QPSK nose margins are compared.
Figure8.1.2.2-1: QPSK vs. BPSK EVM difference
However RAN4 has already defined EVM for BPSK, see Table 6.5.2.1.1-1 in TS
36.101 which can be reused for NB-IOT.

**Single tone rotated pi/2 BPSK EVM requirement is 17.5 %.**
## 8.1.3 Minimum and OFF power
#### 8.1.3.1 Fully allocated channel case
**Minimum power case:**
Tx power for near UE at eNodeB input = -40 dBm (200 kHz) -- 70 dB = -110 dBm
(200 kHz)
Conclusion: No issue as no other UE is transmitting.
Agreement: NB-IoT Minimum output power requirement for full channel is -40 dBm
(200 kHz)
**OFF power case:**
Tx power from near user at eNodeB input = -50 dBm (200 kHz) -- 70 dB = -120
dBm (200 kHz)
Tx power from single user from extreme coverage: 23 dBm -- 164 dB = -141dBm
(15 kHz)
As for extreme coverage case far UE is transmitting only 1 tone this means
that we need to scale near UE OFF power to same bandwidth thus -120 -
10*log(1/12) = -130.8 dBm (15 kHz)
Near user OFF power leakage at eNodeB input is 10.2 dB higher than
transmission power of far user for single tone bandwidth. However this power
corresponds to noise density of -50dBm/200k -10*log10 (200k) ïƒ  -123dBm/Hz
-70dB ïƒ  -173dBm/Hz which is rougly the thermal noise floor and can be seen as
acceptable noise level.
**Multiple users and OFF power:**
There can be very large quantities of NB-IoT UE's in the cell without
transmissions and those must at minimum fulfill the OFF power requirement.
These powers are summing up and create a noise floor that interferes eNodeB
reception. However, vast majoarity of UE's is experiencing much greater
pathloss than minimum coupling loss. Also NB-IoT UE's spend most of time in
some kind of sleep mode to save battery and during that time there cannot be
in practice any transmission leakage at UE antenna port as othervise NB-IoT
would consume its battery far too quickly. Based on these reason -- 50 dBm /
200 kHz can be used as a full channel OFF power requirement.
Agreement: NB-IoT OFF power requirement for full channel is -50 dBm (200 kHz)
#### 8.1.3.2 Single tone case
In this case it is assumed that Min (-40 dBm) and OFF (-50 dBm) power
requirements are still defined for the channel so for single tone case, the
power is all concentrate on one tone:
Min power -- 40 dBm per tone
OFF power -- 50 dBm per tone
**Minimum power case:**
Tx power from near user at eNodeB input = -40 dBm (15 kHz) -- 70 dB = -110 dBm
(15 kHz)
Tx power from far user (single tone transmission) from extreme coverage: 23
dBm -- 164 dB =-141dBm (15 kHz)
Near user single tone power is 31 dB more than far user single tone power at
eNodeB input however tones are on different positions. Assuming 0.1*2 ppm
frequency difference, the leakage from one tone to the adjacent tone is about
37 dB. It means the far user SIR=-141-(-110-37) = 6dB, the demodulation SNR
threshold for far user at 20 dB coverage extension is typical in the order of
-12 dB which means there is large margin to demod the far user.
Agreement: NB-IoT Minimum output power requirement is -40 dBm over 200 kHz
channel bandwidth.
**OFF power case:**
In OFF power case UE is not transmitting thus it is not necessary to define
single tone OFF power requirement in addition to full channel requirement.
Agreement: Single tone NB- IoT OFF power requirement is not necessary
### 8.1.4 Spectrum emission mask and spurious emission domain boundary
Boundary between out-of-band domain and spurious emission domain was discussed
in RAN4#78. Out-of-band domain is the frequency range, immediately outside the
necessary bandwidth but excluding the spurious domain, in which out-of-band
emissions generally predominate. Spurious emission domain is the frequency
range beyond the out-of-band domain in which spurious emissions generally
predominate.
It was agreed in RAN4#78bis for NB-IoT that the boundary between out-of-band
domain and spurious emission domain for NB-IoT UE is specified as **âˆ†F~OOB~ =
1.7 MHz.** The spurious emission limits apply for the frequency ranges that
are more than **âˆ†F~OOB\ ~** from the edge of the NB-IoT channel bandwidth.
Spurious emission limits are given in ITU recommendation ITU-R M.1581 and are
captured in Table 8.1.4-1
Table 8.1.4-1: Spurious emissions limits

### 8.2.4 In-band blocking
In previous meeting it has been discussed that NB-IoT blocking requirements
should be based on deployment scenarios and also there has been discussion to
relax some NB-IoT bloking requirements compared to E-UTRA requirements to
allow omitting the SAW filter. In-band blocking performance is not affected by
SAW filter as interferers are in-band thus decision on bloking requirements
can be based on likely deployment scenario. Therefore as NB-IoT operates on
same operating bands as E-UTRA it is propsed to adopt same in-band blocker
levels as for E-UTRA (and UTRA). Wanted signal level in bloking tests is
typically set higher than REFSENS to allow some performance degradation in
presence of blockers. It is proposed to define NB-IoT signal level to be 6 dB
higher than NB-IoT REFSENS.

### 8.2.5 NB-IoT receiver intermodulation
For UTRA and E-UTRA the intermodulation requirement is very similar. In both
cases on of the interferers is CW and the other one is modulated carrier. Both
CW and modulated carrier power levels are -- 46 dBm. For 5 MHz E-UTRA and UTRA
CW offset is 10 MHz and modulated carrier offset is 20 MHz.
The interferer power levels -- 46 dBm comes from ARIB specifiactions
[TSGW4#2(99)038] and has been used for both UTRA and E-UTRA. These interferer
powers and the concept that other interferer is CW and the other modulated
carrier should be re-used for NB-IoT. The modulated carrier could be selected
as 1.4 MHz E-UTRA and following E-UTRA intermodulation specification the
offsets are CW = Â±BW/2 Â±2.1 = Â±0.1 Â±2.1 MHz and E-UTRA = 2 x (Â±0.1 Â±2.1) MHz.
Thus we have following proposal for NB-IoT Intemodulation requirement
parameters.l
**Proposal 1: Agree NB-IoT Intemodulation requirement parameters in Table 1**
Table 8.2.5-1: NB-IoT intermodulation requirement parameters
* * *
NB-IoT Signal power REFSENS + 6 dB CW interferer signal power - 46 dBm 1.4 MHz
E-UTRA interferer signal power - 46 dBm CW interferer offset Â± 2.2 MHz 1.4 MHz
E-UTRA interferer Â± 4.4 MHz

### 8.2.6 Narrowband blocking
Narrowband blocking was introduced in E-UTRA specification allow e.g. E-UTRA
and GSM coexistence in adjacent operator allocations. For E-UTRA the
requirement is defined as follows

If E-UTRA narrowband blocking requirement is applied to NB-IoT the wanted
signal level offset needs bandwidth conversion 22 dB + 10LOG(1.4/0.2) = 30.5
dB. If we assume that NB-IoT REFSENS will around -110 dBm we can calculate
that blocker has -55 dBm -- (-110 dBm + 30 dB) = 25 dB higher power than NB-
IoT signal.
If we compare this 25 dB higher CW blocker to already agreed NB-IoT GSM ACS
requirement where the GSM signal has 30 dB higher power than NB-IoT we can
note that ACS requirement is more stringent. Also can be noted that ACS is
tested on two different power levels so that case 1 is in lower power than NB
blocking test and ACS case 2 is test on higher power level than NB blocking
thus ACS test fully convers the NB blocking test in terms of UE dynamic range.
NB blocking interferer is placed 207.5 kHz from victim channel edge and this
frequency point is within ACS test GSM interferer channel bandwidth therefore
there is no gap in frequeancy domain either when considering how ACS test
fulfils the purpose of the NB blocking requirement. Finally we conclude that
defining NB-IoT narrowband blocking requirement would not give any new
information on NB-IoT UE performance on top of already agreed ACS requirement.
**Proposal: Narrowband blocking requirement is not defined for NB-IoT UE.**
### 8.2.7 Receiver spurious emissions
NB-IoT UE needs to fullfill receiver spurious emission requirement as
specified in section 7.9 in TS 36.101. As section 4.3A stated that UE needs to
meet the general requirements in addition to additional requirements there is
no need to have dedicated clasue for NB-IoT UE.
*** ****************TS 36.101************************
4.3A Applicability of minimum requirements (CA, UL-MIMO, ProSe, Dual
Connectivity, UE category 0, UE category M1)
The requirements in clauses 5, 6 and 7 which are specific to CA, UL-MIMO,
ProSe, Dual Connectivity, UE category 0, and UE category M1 are specified as
suffix A, B, C, D, E where;
a) Suffix A additional requirements need to support CA
b) Suffix B additional requirements need to support UL-MIMO
c) Suffix C additional requirements need to support Dual Connectivity
d) Suffix D additional requirements need to support ProSe
e) Suffix E additional requirements need to support UE category 0 and category
M1
A terminal which supports the above features needs to meet both the general
requirements and the additional requirement applicable to the additional
subclause (suffix A, B, C, D and E) in clauses 5, 6 and 7. Where there is a
difference in requirement between the general requirements and the additional
subclause requirements (suffix A, B, C, D, and E) in clauses 5, 6 and 7, the
tighter requirements are applicable unless stated otherwise in the additional
subclause.
*** ****************TS 36.101************************
**Proposa: Standard receiver spurious emission requirement in section 7.9 in
TS 36.101 applies also for NB-IoT UE hence no need to have dedicated clause
for NB-IoT.**
