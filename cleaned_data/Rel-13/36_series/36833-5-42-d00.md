# 4 Background
The 3,5 GHz band has been widely recognized as the most probable global
harmonized TDD band and will play an important role in meeting the explosive
mobile data demands. Regional band planning or re-farming considerations for
this band have made significant progress in the world in recent years.
2-CC carrier aggregation in this band has been a successful mechanism to
provide additional bandwidth and corresponding requirements has been captured
in [2]. However, there are still market requirements on even higher bandwidth
since operators in some countries can get large spectrum up to 60MHz.
Consequently, a new WID proposal \" LTE Advanced intra-band contiguous Carrier
Aggregation in Band 42 for 3DL\" was set up in RAN#65 meeting [3]. The
objectives of this WI are as follows,
\- Specify the RF requirements for Band 42 intra-band contiguous CA supporting
up to 3CC in downlink.
\- Define channel bandwidth combinations for carrier aggregation in 45MHz,
50MHz, 55MHz and 60MHz contiguous spectrum.
\- Add the performance requirements for this band in the relevant
specifications.
# 5 Study of E-UTRA requirements
## 5.1 Operating bands and channel bandwidths
Table 5.1-1 defines the supported E-UTRA CA configurations and bandwidth
combination set for LTE-advanced intra-band contiguous CA in Band 42. The 5
MHz, 10 MHz and 15 MHz carriers are only allowed at the edges of aggregated
channel bandwidth so that potential co-existence issue with adjacent systems
can be handled with some flexibility.

for intra-band contiguous CA

## 5.2 Specific UE RF requirements
The receiver requirement structure for 3 contiguous DL CCs has been developed
during the work phase of CA_Band 40D and CA_Band 41 D as listed in Table
5.2-1.
Table 5.2-1 Receiver requirements for 3 contiguous DL CCs in TS 36.101

Image Support CA bandwidth class D in CA band agnostic way
* * *
As can be seen in Table 5.2-1, majority of the requirements are defined in a
CA band agnostic way, which means that CA_42D can generally reuse most of the
current requirements for bandwidth class D and only few updates are needed for
some RF requirements, such as REFSENS, in-band blocking and out-of-band
blocking.
**[- REFSENS]{.underline}**
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the throughput for REFSENS is
measured on a per CC basis and the same reference sensitivity level as that
for single CC is reused on a per CC basis. Hence the increasing of DL CC
numbers does not impact the REFENS level. Only the uplink RB configurations
need to be defined for CA_42D UE REFSENS requirements.

NOTE 1: The carrier centre frequency of SCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL operating band. NOTE 2: The transmitted power over both PCC and SCC shall be set to PUMAX as defined in subclause 6.2.5A. NOTE 3: The UL resource blocks in both PCC and SCC shall be confined within the transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.6-1). NOTE 4: The UL resource blocks in PCC shall be located as close as possible to the downlink operating band, while the UL resource blocks in SCC shall be located as far as possible from the downlink operating band. NOTE 5: In case a CA configuration consists of CC channel bandwidths which are unequal in bandwidth the PCC channel bandwidth shall be the larger one for reference sensitivity test. NOTE 6: For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirement is verified with the largest number of [simultaneous] active uplink carriers supported by the UE. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
**[- In-band blocking]{.underline}**
The wanted signal level per CC has been defined for CA bandwidth D as shown in
Table 5.2-3. CA_42D can reuse the in-band blocking parameter setting and
extend the requirements applicability as shown in Table 5.2-4.

**[- Out-of-band blocking]{.underline}**

## 5.3 Specific BS RF requirements
For BS capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation in contiguous spectrum in
single band, the RF requirements currently specified in the BS specifications
TS 36.104 are agnostic to the number of carriers supported by the BS in intra-
band contiguous CA operation.
The test configuration and test requirements in the BS test specification TS
36.141 are also defined in a generic way. The test configuration only gives a
principle on how to create test signals depending on manufacturer's
declaration on number of carriers and other parameters so that a multi-carrier
and/or CA BS can be well verified.
Therefore, the current BS RF requirements are applicable for 3-CC contiguous
intra-band DL CA in Band 42, and no change in the BS specifications is
required.
## 5.4 Specific RRM requirements
The RRM requirements for carrier aggregations, as specified in the
specification TS 36.133, have been updated to support CA operation up to 3
carriers in version 12.5.0 (listed below). And the requirements are all
agnostic to specific CA combinations.
Table 5.4-1: RRM requirements in TS 36.133
* * *
Section No. Requirements Notes to the requirements 4 E-UTRAN RRC_IDLE state

up to 3 CCs 9 Measurements performance requirements for UE Support CA
operation up to 3 CCs 10 Measurements Performance Requirements for E-UTRAN

* * *
Therefore, no further change specific for Band 42 3DL is required for RRM
requirements.
