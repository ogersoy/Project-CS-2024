# 4 Background
The 700MHz band is a potential global band that is planned to be used for
LTE/LTE-A networks deployment. The Arab League has recommended that the
spectrum of 698-703MHz UL/753-758MHz DL can be implemented for IMT in
combination with part of 703-733MHz UL/758-788MHz DL spectrum, see figure 4-1,
while meeting Out of Band Emission limit of -25 dBm/8MHz below 694MHz from the
LTE UE transmission within the new E-UTRA band. It is noted that E-UTRA Band
28 OOBE requirement is -25 dBm/8MHz for 470- 694MHz from the LTE UE
transmission in the Arab League counties.
Figure 4-1: 700MHz spectrum in the Arab region
Many Administrations of the Arab Spectrum Management Group (ASMG) have
supported the development of new E-UTRA band that includes this spectrum, The
Arab League has sent liaison statement to 3GPP requesting the standardization
of the new E-UTRA band that includes 2x5MHz spectrum (UL: 698-703MHz, DL:
753-758MHz portion considering the OOBE requirement of -25 dBm/8MHz for 470-
694MHz.
The Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of United Arab Emirates (UAE) has
announced its initial 700MHz band plan for mobile broadband services, which
has been vacated from incumbent broadcasting service, in 2013\. The UAE has
already started the process for allocating the 700MHz band (698\~790MHz) to
local governmental organization (i.e. PPDR) and commercial operators.
A new E-UTRA band needs to be developed to include this 2x5MHz spectrum (UL:
698-703MHz, DL: 753-758MHz portion.
It has been noted that this spectrum has also been considered in the CEPT
countries for PPDR usage and compatibility studies with adjacent systems have
been performed by SE7.
The objectives of the WI [3] are as follows:
1\. Initial study phase:
a. Agree on band arrangement during RAN4#76 including (698-703MHz for UL and
753-758MHz for DL) while focusing on the following options:
i. 2x15MHz: 698 -- 713MHz for UL and 753-768MHz for DL.
ii. 2x20MHz: 698 -- 718MHz for UL and 753-773MHz for DL.
iii. 2x30MHz: 698 -- 728 MHz for UL and 753 - 783 MHz for DL.
> Note: Other options are not precluded considering the filter performance of
> each option and capability to achieve OOBE requirement.
2\. Given the band arrangement, Specify RF requirements for the new E-UTRA
band.
3\. Specify channel bandwidths of 5 MHz (e.g. 698-703MHz), 10 MHz (e.g.
698-708MHz) and 15 MHz (e.g. 698-713MHz).
**4\. Specify band numbering of the new band**
5\. Address potential UE coexistence issues, if any.
Notes:
\- This new FDD E-UTRA band is expected to be release independent starting
from release 8 onwards.
Considering ongoing work in CEPT on this band, additional OOBE requirement for
5 MHz carrier bandwidth might be considered, as possible, if CEPT work will be
concluded within the timeframe of this Work Item.
# 5 Frequency band arrangements and regulatory background
## 5.1 Frequency band arrangements
### 5.1.1 Spectrum needs and usage
In [4], the Arab Spectrum Management Group (ASMG) informed about the _growing
demands for mobile broadband by commercial and governmental entities in the
region_ and propose the specification of a new band which would combine the
2x5MHz below Band 28 together with part of Band 28.
The ASMG has also stated in [4] that LTE UE out-of-band emission (OOBE) limit
below 694MHz is -25dBm/8MHz in order to protect DTV receiver.
When Band 28 was introduced in 3GPP, the UE specifications were specified
assuming a dual duplexer implementation with 2x30MHz duplexers as this was the
state-of-the-art on filter pass-band. A new band plan including
698-703/753-758 MHz (i.e. around the same frequencies as Band 28) will have
the same limitations in terms of pass-band as Band 28, i.e., the maximum pass-
band is 2x30MHz.
In general, the larger the pass-band, the more commercial and/or governmental
allocation options can be covered. This increases the band attention and the
likelihood of UEs to include the band implementation in their front ends. At
the same time, it also brings economies of scale. Thus, a 2x30MHz band plan
for the new band including 698-703/753-758 MHz seems the most suitable to
cover the spectrum needs in the Arab region.
### 5.1.2 Filter Considerations
It is important to meet the OOBE requirement by filter attenuation as much as
possible. Otherwise, large power back-off may be needed. Given that the
frequency separation between the new band the DTV receiver below 694MHz is
only 4MHz, this imposes challenges in the filter design. In the mean time, it
is desirable that the existing filter design can be reused for this new band
filter to reduce R&D cost.
The 30MHz pass band for this new band is exactly 5MHz shift in frequency from
the B28 lower duplexer. Hence some of the design for B28 lower duplexer may be
reused for this new band filter. Another way is to consolidate the B68 and
B28A bands into a single filter, which is a cost effective way to leverage
volume of scale and optimize the re-use to enable B68 for free, and
performance impact to B28A is shown to be minimal.
Due to the close proximity in frequency between the new band and DTV bands,
steep filter attenuation is needed at 4MHz offset. In general, reducing the
filter pass-band helps to design steeper filters. While detailed filter spec
is still missing in order to completely quantify the gain, based on
preliminary feedback from filter vendors, the gain from reducing the pass-band
is not dramatic since the steep rejection is required at 4MHz from the band
edge. In order to progress the work, it is recommended that the band plan to
be defined based on information at hand.
### 5.1.3 Conclusion
Based on the discussion above and consider all the aspects. Consensus has been
reached that the 2x30MHz band plan should be used for the new band.
## 5.2 Regulatory Background
Arab Spectrum Management Group (ASMG) is a working group that related to the
Arab ministers for Information and Communication Technologies. This group is
responsible for managing the frequency spectrum in the Arab region. It was
established in 1997, to consolidate cooperation in the field of spectrum
management, through the participation and exchange of views on developments in
radio communications, as well as the management and coordination of all
relevant space management issues, and the World Radio-communication
Conferences and other issues related to spectrum management.
At its meeting on 15 - 19 February 2015 ASMG discussed the growing demands for
mobile broadband by commercial and governmental entities in the region and the
requirement to develop and standardize a new E-UTRA band to facilitate network
deployments in the Region, in connection with the options of frequency
arrangements for the use of the 694-790 MHz band for International Mobile
Telecommunications (IMT) in ITU Region 1.
The ASMG has recommended that the spectrum of 698-703MHz UL/753-758MHz DL can
be implemented for IMT in combination with part of 703-733MHz UL/758-788MHz DL
spectrum, while meeting the Out of Band Emission limit of -25 dBm/8MHz below
694MHz from the LTE UE transmission within the new E-UTRA band. It has been
noted that the adopted OOBE requirement of E-UTRA Band 28 from the LTE UE
transmission is -25 dBm/8MHz for 470- 694MHz in many Arab and African
Administrations of ITU Region 1.

work item
# 7 General issues
# 8 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
## 8.1 UE emission for Co-existence with other 3GPP bands
The UE coexistence table needs to be updated to include the new 700MHz band
(band 68). B28 can't fulfill the -50 dBm/MHz for the 700MHz band (or band 68)
as the bands are too close. The general spurious emissions limits as defined
in TS 36.101 in Table 6.6.3.1-1 and Table 6.6.3.1-2 apply for > F~OOB~.
UE to UE Co-existence of the band 68 with other Bands in Arab Regions needs to
be considered. Those bands include band 1, 3, 7, 8, 28, 38, 40. The Band 68 UL
emissions can be kept as -50dBm/MHz for protection of other Bands. Changes to
TS 36.101 are included in Table 2-1.

## 8.2 BS specific
### 8.2.1 Operating band unwanted emissions
The same unwanted emission requirements for Band 28 apply to the 700MHz band
for Arab Region or Band 68. This is Category A and Category B (option 1) in
chapters 6.6.3.1 and 6.6.3.2.1 of TS 36.104, respectively.
TS 37.104 includes a single mask for unwanted emissions. This is more
stringent than Category B (Option 1) and applies to a Band 68
#### 8.2.1.1 Minimum requirements for Wide Area BS (Category A)
For E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 28,
29, 31, 44[, 68]{.underline} emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels
specified in Tables 6.6.3.1â€‘1 to 6.6.3.1-3.
#### 8.2.1.2 Category B requirements (Option 1)
For E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 5, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31,
44[, 68]{.underline} emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified
in Tables 6.6.3.2.1-1 to 6.6.3.2.1-3:
### 8.2.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements
Table 8.2.2-1 and Table 8.2.2-2 reflect the changes needed in Clause 6.6.4.3
of TS 36.104 and Clause 6.6.4.5.4 of TS 36.141. The same modifications are
needed in Clause 6.6.1.3 of TS 37.104 and Clause 6.6.1.5.5 of TS 37.141.
Co-existence between Band 28 and Band 68 needs some special considerations as
shown in Figure 8.2.2-1. Note that the Arab region allocates the lowest 30MHz
of Band 28 only (703-733/758-788 MHz) and hence coexistence between Band [68]
and the lower part of Band 28 is considered in this WI.

Figure 8.2.2-1: 3GPP operating bands around Band [68] in the same geographical
area
The DL spurious emissions for BS co-existence applies at 10MHz from the DL
operating band and thus Band 68 do not need to fulfil the standard -52dBm/MHz
protection towards Band 28, and Band 20 DL. The same should apply to Band 28
emissions towards Band 68 DL. Band 44 is also specified 703-803MHz. This band
is not intended to be deployed in the same geographical area as Band 68 and
thus co-existence between these bands is not needed.
In addition, Band 67 is also being specified (see TR 36.895), this is a DL-
only band 738-758MHz. Special considerations are also needed for xo-existence
with this band.

6.6.4.5.5 of TS 36.141. The same modifications are needed in Clause 6.6.1.4 of

### 8.2.4 General blocking requirement
The general blocking requirements currently specified for E-UTRA BS apply the
in-band blocking signal within +/-20 MHz of the UL frequency range of a band,
except when the DL frequency range of the same band falls within such range.
This should apply for Band 68 in Clause 7.6.1 of TS 36.104 and, Clause 7.6.5.1
of TS 36.141, to ensure sufficient BS receiver blocking ability. The same
modifications are needed in Clause 7.5.1 of TS 37.104 and Clause 7.4.5.1,
7.5.5.1 of TS 37.141.

## 8.3 UE specific
### 8.3.1 UE reference sensitivity
#### 8.3.1.1 Band 68 band plan
The passband of the 700MHz band for Arab Region coincides with the
passbandpass band of each of the duplexers assumed on the implementation of
Band 28 UEs. Moreover, it corresponds with a 5MHz downshift of the lower
duplexer. So the reference sensitivity requirements for B28 can be reused for
B68.
Figure 8.3.1.1-1: Band 28 UE filter implementation assumption and UE filter
implementation of the 700MHz band for Arab Region
#### 8.3.1.2 Band 68 uplink configuration
Similarly to B28, the Rx-Tx duplex separation for B68 FDD band is only 55MHz.
Since the excessive Tx noise may distort the REFSENS measurement, a limitation
on the uplink RB allocation for the reference sensitivity requirement is
needed. It is proposed to have the same RB allocation for the reference
sensitivity requirement, as shown in Table 8.3.1.2-1 below.

#### 8.3.1.3 Reference sensitivity value
The reference sensitivity value can be derived based on noise contributions
including thermal and transmitter noise, and desired SINR at reference
sensitivity level. Based on the discussion of 2.1, a similar approach to
derive B28 REFSENS can be used for B68. It is proposed to have the same
reference sensitivity value as B28, as shown in Table 8.3.1.3-1 below,

### 8.3.2 UE MOP
For Band 28, UE MOP is 23dBm +2/-2.5dB. There is a 0.5dB relaxation for the
lower tolerance. This is partially because that a dual-duplexer architecture
is used for B28, which introduces an extra 0.5dB of switch loss. Assuming a
similar filter as the lower B28 duplexer is used for Band 68, also considering
that no dual-filter is needed for Band 68, which eliminates the switch, hence
0.5dB relaxation is not needed for the lower tolerance. It is proposed that
the UE MOP to be 23dBm +2/-2dB for Band 68, as shown in the Table 8.3.2-1
below,

### 8.3.3 UE protection for DTV
The emission requirement for protection of DTV below 694MHz for ARAB region is
-25dBm/8MHz. This section shows how to meet the DTV protection limit.
Table 8.3.3-1: Void
#### 8.3.3.1 Power reduction without filter
Table Table 8.3.3.1-1 below summarizes the required A-MPR without any filter
rejection.

It shows that big power reductions are needed in order to meet the -25dBm/8MHz
emission level. One of the main motivations to standardize this band is to
provide broadband spectrum for public safety communities, and a large power
back-off is very undesirable for such application. Not like a commercial
broadband network, public safety networks are usually sparsely built with much
fewer number of base stations. Uplink coverage is critical in order to meet
the public safety application requirement. To better and more efficient
utilize the radio spectrum, it is preferable to meet the DTV protection
emission requirement with the help of filter rejection, and without power
reduction.
#### 8.3.3.2 Filter solution
Different filter technologies can be considered for DTV protection. SAW filter
is the most common and non-expensive filter technology. However, this filter
may not provide enough rejection at 694MHz. Other advanced filter
technologies, such as temperature compensated SAW (TC SAW) filters or FBAR can
provide higher filter rejection than SAW filters at anywhere from cost parity
to various levels of additional expense. Table 8.3.3.2-1 shows filter data
from four different vendors.
Table 8.3.3.2-1: Standard SAW, TC SAW and FBAR filter rejection
* * *

* * *
Combining the filter rejection with UE power reduction will provide better
trade-off in terms of realizing certain emission requirement, while not
putting too much burden on filter design. Due to the non-linearity of the
device components, when operating at near saturation point, non-linearity
creates undesirable out-of-band emission. Reducing the UE power by 1 or 2 dB
will greatly reduce the out-of-band emission.
This is illustrated by Table 8.3.3.2-3, where a UE out-of-band emission values
(in dBm/8MHz) are simulated with different power reduction numbers (in dB),
assuming the UE is allocated with 50RBs in a 10MHz channel. When UE transmit
power is reduced by 2dB, the emission level is reduced by 8dB. However, as the
emission level goes down, and as UE components start to operate at linear
region, power reduction of 1dB, will result in about 1dB (or less) of emission
level reduction. At this point, the cost of reducing UE Tx power is becoming
too big, in order to meet the required emission level. Filter rejection can
help achieve the emission requirement without scarifying too much UL coverage
loss. On the other hand, reducing the UE power by 1\~2dB can also reduce the
filter requirement, hence make it easier to design such filters.
**Table 8.3.3.2-3: UE out-of-band emissions at 686\~694MHz with different
power reduction values (no filter rejection)**

-27.5 -30.4

#### 8.3.3.4 A-MPR with filters
To evaluate the emission into the DTV channel, a Riemann sum is taken over the
8 MHz measurement bandwidth of the PA emission scaled by the available filter
rejection by filters in Table 8.3.3.2-2. The specified filter rejection is
estimated at the midpoint of each 1 MHz frequency bin and taken as the
rejection across the entire bin. The PA output was also simulated at the mid-
point of each bin over a bandwidth of 1 MHz. PA simulation results were
confirmed by lab measurements. After applying the filter response to the PA
output on each frequency bin, the sum on a linear scale is taken across all
bins from 686 MHz to 694 MHz. Finally, the power sum is converted back to dBm
units.
Based on this approach, the following results were obtained using TC SAW from
vendor A.
