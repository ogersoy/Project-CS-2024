# 1 Scope
Positioning mechanisms were specified in 3GPP as a key feature for E-UTRA
networks since Release 9, e.g. OTDOA, E-CID etc. They are not only used in
helping meet regulatory requirements, but also utilized with increasing
importance to enable all kinds of location based applications.
The proliferation of heterogeneous network deployments brings some challenges
also in the area of efficient terminal positioning and calls for the study of
enhanced mechanisms and positioning performance requirements.
The addition of multiple nodes in heterogeneous networks can improve the
position accuracy remarkably if the specificities of such deployments are
taken into account in the positioning mechanisms. Some examples include the
support of several transmission points with identical cell IDs and improved
support for positioning in carrier aggregation.
Furthermore, the accuracy of current positioning mechanisms and in particular
OTDOA and E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement is only defined
for limited scenarios:
• Limited channel bandwidth for the cells to be measured (reference and
neighbour cells)
• Tests defined assuming single Tx antenna. Practical network might have Tx
diversity on antenna port 6 which is used for RSTD measurements
It is desirable to study the possibility of enhanced accuracy for other
practical deployment scenarios.
The present document is the Technical Report for the Study Item on positioning
enhancements for E-UTRA.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Study item objective
The objective is to study accuracy enhancements for current positioning
mechanisms such as OTDOA and E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement in heterogeneous deployment scenarios and different system
bandwidths.
The feasibility of improving the existing UE positioning performance
requirements of OTDOA and E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement
shall be studied for the following cases:
● Larger available bandwidths (e.g. 15 and 20MHz for OTDOA and 10, 15, and 20
MHz for E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement).
● Smaller available bandwidths (e.g. 1.4 and 3 MHz for OTDOA and E-CID based
on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement)
● Possible use of downlink Tx diversity for the positioning reference signals
(PRS), e.g., schemes transparent to UE, and its impact on the both UE and
system performance and/or complexity. Use of non-transparent schemes can be
discussed.
● Deployment of RRHs with identical cell IDs for OTDOA and E-CID based on UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurement.
● Carrier aggregation scenarios (including scenarios with multiple TAs for
E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement)
The study includes the definition of the above mentioned scenarios in an
initial phase.

## 6.3 Performance of possible PRS Tx diversity schemes
### 6.3.1 Simulation assumptions
In this section, the simulation assumptions for PRS Tx diversity evaluation
are provided.
● Cell layout
Two cells topology is adopted
• 2 cells at distinct locations
• the distances between each cell and target UE are identical
Figure 6.3.1-1 cell layout
Cell 1 is reference cell and cell 2 is neighbour cell.
● Occasion number
1 or 2 occasions are used to estimate the RSTD between cell1 and cell2. The
PRS of cell1 and cell2 are transmitted in these 1 or 2 occasions.
● PRS BW
PRS BW=10MHz is assumed as a typical case and correspondingly one PRS subframe
is within one occasion.
● Transmit antenna assumptions
Antenna #1 and #2 are geographically co-located. The detailed assumptions are
listed in the following table.

### 6.3.2 RSTD Estimation with Diversity
A general structure for TOA estimation with diversity is shown in Figure
6.3.2-1 below, where the diversity system has _P_ branches. The TOA is
estimated independently at each diversity branch of the receiver, and then a
"combining algorithm" is used to process the TOA estimates from all branches
to obtain a desired "optimum" estimate for RSTD calculation.
Figure 6.3.2-1: General Structure of TOA Estimation with Diversity Techniques.
A variety of different combining algorithms can be designed for different
diversity techniques. Two examples were used for the simulation results in
subclause 6.3.3:
1) ${\hat{\tau}}_{0} = \text{min}\left{ {\hat{\tau}}_{o}^{i} \right}$ ("Method
#1")
2) ${\hat{\tau}}_{0} = \frac{1}{P}\sum_{i = 1}^{P}{\hat{\tau}}_{0}^{(i)}$
("Method #2")
Other possibilities may be to include a weighting factor, where the estimate
of each diversity branch is weighted with a coefficient that reflects the
quality of the TOA estimation at each branch.
For the simulation results in subclause 6.3.3, _P=2_ has been used as defined
in the simulation assumptions (subclause 6.3.1).
### 6.3.3 Performance characterization
In this clause the performance gains are evaluated by using link level
simulations based on the simulation assumptions in clause 6.3.1.
#### 6.3.3.1 Link level simulation results
The results in this subclause were obtained with the combining method #1 in
subclause 6.3.2 (i.e., min. TOA is selected as final TOA for RSTD calculation)
[14].

##### 6.3.3.1.1 Comparison of TOA Estimation Schemes
The following Figures compare the results with combining method #1 and method
#2 defined in subclause 6.3.2 (i.e., min. TOA is selected as final TOA and
average TOA is selected as the final TOA, respectively) for the Urban A
example:
Figure 6.3.3.1.1-1: RSTD link level simulation results (Qualcomm)
**a) Time Diversity Benefit:** \ The curves "No Diversity" in Figure
6.3.3.1.1-1 show the benefit from time diversity; i.e., a single TX antenna is
used but two PRS occasions which are combined as described in subclause 6.3.2
above. With combining method #1 (min TOA), a time diversity effect is
exploited. The performance is about 1.5 Ts better at the 70^th^ percentile
compared to the use of a single PRS occasion.\ \ Due to the fading, the two
TOAs estimated are slightly different, and picking the smallest TOA among the
two as a final TOA estimate should provide a TOA as close as possible to the
desired line-of-sight TOA.\ \ With combining method #2 (average TOA),
essentially no time diversity benefit is obtained. The "No Diversity" curve in
Figure 6.3.3.1.1-1 (right hand side) overlap with the result of a single PRS
occasion (baseline). The average TOA over two consecutive occasions is (on
average) similar to the TOA estimated from a single occasion.
**b) Antenna Switching Benefit:\** With the given channel models, antenna
switching does not provide an additional performance benefit compared to the
use of a single antenna ("No Diversity").\ \ With combining method #1 (Min
TOA) the benefit is essentially due to time diversity. With combining method
#2 (average TOA), no benefit compared to a single PRS occasion can be obtained
(the same as (a) above).
**c) TX Diversity 1 (Power splitting with sign flip):\** This technique shows
worse performance compared to no diversity; slightly worse with combining
method #1, and considerably worse with combining method #2. With combining
method #2, the performance is even worse compared to the base line result with
a single PRS occasion.\ \ In the first PRS occasion, the sum of the two TX
signals is used at the receiver; for the second PRS occasion the difference of
the two TX signals is used at the receiver. With the given channel models,
this means that most of the signal is canceled in the second occasion. With
combining method #1, we pick the TOA mostly from the first occasion; with
combining method #2, we compute an average TOA, but since the TOA from the
2^nd^ occasion is quite bad (since components cancel due to the 180 degrees
phase shift), the final TOA get worse compared to the use of a single
occasion.\ \ With combining method #1, we essentially use the TOA from the
first occasion only, and therefore, no additional time diversity. The benefit
here comes primarily from space diversity only, where the two TX signals in
the first occasion are added from the two antennas. With the given channel
models, space diversity alone does not provide the same benefit as time
diversity alone. Therefore, the performance with method #1 is worse compared
to no diversity (i.e., time diversity only), but still better compared to the
baseline with a single PRS occasion only.
**d) TX Diversity 2 (Power splitting):\** This technique shows the best
performance in the simulations. Here, in both occasions the signal from the
two antennas adds up at the receiver. There are two different TOAs available
(compared to a single "good" TOA as in case of TX Diversity 1, where the
signal in the second occasion mostly cancel), and by picking the smallest
among the two TOAs, both, time and space diversity is exploited. The benefit
with combining method #1 is about 2.5 Ts compared to a single PRS occasion at
the 70^th^ percentile; and about 1.5 Ts compared to time diversity only ("No
Diversity") at the 70^th^ percentile.\ \ Also with combining method #2, a gain
can be obtained, which is however, slightly worse compared to combining
technique #1. The average TOA is always more biased than a single selected
TOA.
#### 6.3.3.2 Conclusions from interested companies
Table 6.3.3.2-1: Conclusions from interested companies
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+ | Company | Conclusion | +----------+----------------------------------------------------------+ | Qualcomm | Under the given simulation assumptions and channel | | | models, some TX Diversity schemes can achieve about 1 -- | | | 2Ts improvement, if the UE processes the PRS occasions | | | accordingly.

# 7 Feasibility on enhancement for OTDOA and E-CID with identical cell ID RRHs
## 7.1 Network Scenarios
In certain het-net deployments, some non-collocated RRHs have the identical
PCI with the associated Macro cell so that these RRHs transmit the identical
reference signals, and therefore it may cause ambiguousness on reference
signal TOA detection. Scenarios to be studied:
● OTDOA scenario: RRH with PCI identical to the associated Macro cell
● E-CID scenario: RRH with PCI identical to the associated Macro cell
## 7.2 Possible enhancements on OTDOA
OTDOA is based on RSTD measurements which in turn are based on PRS signals
transmitted in low-interference positioning subframes. An advantage that the
RRH scenario brings is the possibility to receive signals from more locations
within the same cell and thereby possibly improve the OTDOA performance. A
potential challenge though is that when multiple non-collocated RRHs of the
same macro cell are using the same PRS sequence, it is not straightforward how
the UE may distinguish between the PRSs transmitted from different RRHs to
benefit from the RRH site diversity.
### 7.2.1 Simulation assumptions
The intention with the study is therefore two-fold [15]:
1) Performance study: Study the OTDOA performance in the RRH scenario with the
same PRSs transmitted from all RRHs of the same macro cell (macro cells are
also transmitting, see Fig. 7.2.1-1),
NOTE: It is FFS whether the scenario with RRHs without macro cells is to be
also studied.
Consider two reference scenarios for the Performance study:
\- RRH scenario with different PRSs transmitted from different RRHs of the
same macro cell (this is to identify whether using the same PRSs at different
RRHs contributes to the OTDOA performance degradation)
\- Macro cell scenario without RRHs (i.e., Rel-9 deployment; this is to
identify the benefits of the RRH scenario over the legacy macro scenario).
2) Enhancement study: Study possible enhancements to further improve the OTDOA
performance in this scenario. However, RAN4 first needs to discuss the
possible enhancements to be studied based on the outcome of the Performance
study.
{width="3.459722222222222in" height="1.76875in"}
Figure 7.2.1-1: Deployment scenario for the Performance study.
For both _Performance study_ and _Enhancement study_ it is proposed to reuse
the simulation methodology used for Rel-9 OTDOA studies. The simulation
approach is outlined as below.
The simulation approach is a static snapshot-based simulator with integrated
link-level behavior in a multi-cell environment. A simulation comprises the
following steps:
_Step 1_. System generation
→ Generate network, drop users randomly with uniform spreading over the
network,
→ Assign UEs to the best cells with respect to the average power gain,
→ Generate interferers, taking into account the PRS pattern.
_Step 2._ OTDOA measurements generation at the link level, while collecting
the signal quality statistics
→ Generate the transmitted signal,
→ Generate the propagation channel and model the received signal at the UE
receiver,
→ Apply a UE receiver algorithm to estimate OTDOA for different neighbor cell.
_Step 3._ Based on OTDOA measurements, calculation UE positions in 2D space
for a given set of neighbor cells.
_Step 4._ For each UE, finding positioning accuracy (position error in meters)
> → Use Taylor expansion, where for each UE solve a least squares problem for
> the system of at least three positioning equations.
Simulation assumptions for CoMP scenario #4 (TR 36.819) may be adapted also
for the OTDOA Performance study. Additionally, CoMP scenario with penetration
loss of 20 dB for indoor UEs can also be studied.
At least the following performance metrics are suggested for the results
analysis:
▪ The number of detected cells per UE (CDF)
▪ PRS Ês/Iot of the 1^st^ (the strongest) cell, 2^nd^ cell, 3^rd^ cell, etc.
(CDFs)
▪ PRP of the 1^st^ (the strongest) cell, 2^nd^ cell, 3^rd^ cell, etc. (CDFs),
▪ Location accuracy CDF.
### 7.2.2 Performance characterization
In this section, the simulation results and conclusions from interested
companies are collected.
● Evaluation from Intel [16]
The RSTD estimation accuracies are compared under two scenarios: RRHs have
different CID from Macro and Macro only.

As shown in Figure 7.2.2-1 \~ 7.2.2-3, it is beneficial if PRS is transmitted
from all RRH and the RRH which share the same CID can still be distinguished
by the network and UE.
● Evaluation from Huawei [17]
▪ Scenario1: RRH scenario with different PRSs transmitted from different RRHs
of the same macro cell (this is to identify whether using the same PRSs at
different RRHs contributes to the OTDOA performance degradation)
▪ Scenario2: Macro cell scenario without RRHs (i.e., Rel-9 deployment; this is
to identify the benefits of the RRH scenario over the legacy macro scenario).
▪ Scenario3: RRH scenario with different PRSs transmitted from different RRHs
and no macro cell coverage is assumed (this is to identify whether using the
same PRSs at different RRHs contributes to the OTDOA performance degradation)
▪ Scenario4: RRH scenario with same PRSs transmitted from different RRHs and
no macro cell coverage is assumed

The observations can be obtained from the above figures:
Observation 1: More cells can be detected by UE in scenario1, and PRS Ês/Iot
and PRS received power in scenario 1 are also better than in scenario 2.
Observation 2: The OTDOA performance of scenario 1 is 10.9m \@67% and 25.7m
\@95%.
Observation 3: The OTDOA performance of scenario 2 is 13.9m \@67% and 64.3m
\@95%.
Observation 4: The positioning performance of scenario 1 is much better than
scenario 2, with 22% gain \@67% and 60% gain @ 95%.
Based on the observation 1-4, the proposal 1 is:
Proposal 1: In het-net scenarios, the RRH shall be used for OTDOA to achieve
higher localization accuracy than R9 and the methods to distinguish RRHs shall
be discussed.

From figures above, the observations can be obtained,
Observation 5: The number of detected cells for scenario 4 is less than
scenario 3 as RRHs in scenario 4 may share the same PCI.
Observation 6: The positioning performance of scenario 3 is much better than
performance of scenario 4.
Based on the observations 5-6, the proposal 2 is:
Proposal 2: In the het-net scenarios without Macro coverage, the methods to
distinguish RRHs shall be discussed to achieve higher localization accuracy.
### 7.2.3 Possible enhancement options
For het-net scenarios, the usage of RRH can be beneficial for OTDOA
performance, provided there are methods to distinguish the measured signals
from different RRHs.
#### 7.2.3.1 Possible enhancement options from interested companies
In this section, the possible enhancement options from interested companies
are collected.
● Analysis from Ericsson [18]
Time-domain candidate solutions:
• Proposal 1: Consider the approach based on RRH-specific time offsets as a
baseline approach.
• Proposal 2: The same time offset may be used for a group of RRHs which are
close to each other.
• Proposal 3: Positioning occasions of a cell are a union of the cell's RRHs'
positioning occasions. Positioning occasions of different intra-frequency
cells may be aligned, as in Rel-9.
• Proposal 4: RAN4 to discuss RSTD measurement requirements for the approach
based on RRH-specific PRS time offsets.
• Proposal 5: The same RSTD measurement accuracy as in Rel-9 can apply for
RSTD measurements in deployments with RRH.
• Proposal 6: RSTD measurement period in deployments with RRHs depends on the
number of RRHs.
[]{.underline}
Candidate solutions relying on different sequences:
• Observation: Most of the solutions in this group require new signalling and
have more impact on specification and the involved node (including UE). The
largest expected impacts are with CSI-RS RSTD measurements.
● Analysis from Alcatel-Lucent [19]
Two suggestions regarding to the OTDOA scenario that RRH with PCI identical to
the associated macro cell are proposed.
Observation 1: There is no reason to transmit PRS signal from an RRH with PCI
identical to the associated macro cell since the RSTD measurements associated
with the RRH are not useful for OTDOA positioning because the RRH location is
unknown to the location server.
Observation 2: Transmitting PRS signals from an RRH with PCI identical to the
associated macro cell generates multi-path type interference, which will
degrade the UE's performance in detecting the time of arrival of PRS signals
from the macro cell.
● Analysis from Intel Corporation [20]
Proposal 1: The RRHs with same PCI can be assigned with different PRS muting
patterns. UE reports _prs-mutinginfo_ configured and used for measuring RSTD
for a cell together with other measurement reporting (such as PCI, RSTD, or
RSTD quality), e.g., in IE _NeighbourMeasurementElement_.
Proposal 2: The RRHs with same PCI can be assigned with different PRS
configuration indices. UE reports the configured PRS configuration index
together with other measurement reporting (such as PCI, RSTD, or RSTD
quality), e.g., in IE _NeighbourMeasurementElement_.
● Analysis from Huawei, HiSilicon [21]
▪ Solution 1: Non-overlapping time-separated positioning occasions
Based on the analysis, this method will not have impact on the current
physical design for positioning signal but only some signalling shall be
introduced (possible impact to RAN2/3).
▪ Solution 2: Different RRHs transmit the same PRS in different subframes of
the same positioning occasion
This method will not have impact on the current physical design for
positioning signal but only some signalling shall be introduced (possible
impact to RAN2/3).
▪ Solution 3: Different PRS sequences for different RRHs in the same cell
As the new ID or index might be introduced for scrambling, this method will
not only have impact on the current physical design for positioning signal
(possible impact to RAN1) and also some signalling shall be introduced
(possible impact to RAN2/3). On the other hand, the orthogonality of
scrambling code doesn't show gain over time domain differentiation method, but
will introduce more complexity for UE measurement.
▪ Solution 4: New RRH-specific RS
By using RRH specific RS (e.g. CSI-RS), UE is able to identify the specific
RRH, and then UE can perform positioning measurement based on RRH specific RS
and report to the network for location calculation. It will introduce new
measurement quantity of CSI-RS based TOA in RAN1, but it doesn't need more
identifiers for RRH in signalling. Signalling only focus on the measurement
configuration and reporting. Compared with time domain method, it will not
last too long time for RSTD measurement.

enhancements
Different solutions for OTDOA enhancements in scenarios with RRHs are
summarized and compared in tables below for the two groups of solutions, the
time-domain solutions and the solutions based on TP-specific sequences [22].

## 7.3 Possible enhancements on E-CID
For E-CID positioning, CRS is used for the DL component of the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement and CRS sequence is also derived from PCI, for the UL
component, SRS are used.
### 7.3.1 Simulation assumptions
The intention with the study is therefore two-fold [15]:
_1) Performance study_ : Study the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement
performance in the RRH scenario with the same CRSs transmitted from all RRHs
of the same macro cell. Compare to the reference scenarios (the scenario with
different CRSs transmitted from different RRHs and the macro-only scenario).
Consider two reference scenarios for the Performance study:
\- RRH scenario with different CRSs transmitted from different RRHs of the
same macro cell
\- Macro-only scenario
_2) Enhancement study_ : Study possible enhancements to further improve the UE
E-CID positioning performance in this scenario. However, RAN4 first needs to
discuss the possible enhancements to be studied based on the outcome of the
_Performance study_.
Simulation assumptions for CoMP scenario #4 (TR 36.819) can be adopted also
for the UE E-CID Performance study, and for simplicity, assume that RTT is
determined by UE Rx-Tx only along with ideal (zero) eNodeB Rx-Tx.
For both _Performance study_ and _Enhancement study_ it is proposed to reuse
the simulation methodology used for Rel-9 ECID studies. The simulation
approach is outlined as below.
The simulation approach is a static snapshot-based simulator with integrated
link-level behavior in a multi-cell environment. A simulation comprises the
following steps:
Step 1. System generation
→ Generate network, drop users randomly with uniform spreading over the
network,
→ Assign UEs to the best cell,
→ Generate interferers (full load case can be considered as baseline)
Step 2. UE Rx-Tx measurements generation at the link level, while collecting
the signal quality statistics
Step 3. Generate the performance metrics
At least the following performance metrics are suggested for the results
analysis:
● The distribution (CDF) of UE Rx - Tx time difference measurement error
(delay error) in number of Ts (1 Ts = 32.5 ns) is to be shown for the
reference scenarios for each of the two studies. The measurement error is the
difference between the estimated UE Rx-Tx time difference and the true UE Rx-
Tx time difference. The true Rx-Tx time difference is based on the assumption
that UE has perfect knowledge of serving base station timing.
● The distributions (CDFs) of the RTT error are to be shown for each of the
two studies. The RTT error is the difference between the estimated RTT and the
true RTT.
● Positioning accuracy CDFs. The positioning accuracy is the difference
between the estimated UE location and the actual UE location.
\- Macro-only scenario: true RTT is the doubled distance between UE and macro
eNB
\- RRH scenario with different CRSs transmitted from different RRHs of the
same macro cell: true RTT is the doubled distance between UE and serving RRH
\- RRH scenario with same CRSs transmitted from different RRHs of the same
macro cell: true RTT is the doubled distance between UE and macro eNB
Macro cells are also transmitting CRS.
### 7.3.2 Performance characterization
In this section, the simulation results and conclusions from interested
companies are collected.
#### 7.3.2.1 Simulation results for CoMP (with no CA) with non-collocated
serving cells on the same frequency
● Evaluation from Huawei [23]
▪ Scenario1: Macro-only scenario with different CRSs transmitted from
different macro cells.
▪ Scenario2: RRH scenario with different CRSs transmitted from different RRHs
of the same macro cell
▪ Scenario3: RRH scenario with same CRSs transmitted from different RRHs of
the same macro cell (this is to identify whether using the same CRSs at
different RRHs contributes to the UE E-CID positioning performance
degradation)
NOTE: In the simulated scenarios 1-3, only the DL transmissions are modelled.

Observation 1: Both in AWGN and in fading channel, the performance of scenario
1 and scenario 2 are similar for both Rx-Tx and RTT.
Observation 2: The positioning performance of scenario 3 is much worse than
performance of scenario 2.
Observation 3: The largest part of RTT error comes from the wrong judgement of
anchor point for RTT estimation.
Proposal 1: In the het-net scenarios, the methods to distinguish RRHs shall be
discussed for ECID to achieve higher localization accuracy.

# 8 Feasibility study on enhancement for UE Rx-Tx measurement over multiple
serving cells
## 8.1 Network Scenarios
● Multiple serving cells in CA, i.e., when the serving cells are on different
carrier frequencies, where
▪ The multiple serving cells are non-collocated and this includes also dual
connectivity scenario
In CA, UE can be served by serving cells, e.g. CA scenario 4. Some example
deployment scenarios are illustrated in Figures 8.1-1-- 8.1-2.

## 8.2 Possible enhancement for UE Rx-Tx measurement with multiple serving
cells
### 8.2.1 Possible enhancement options
In this section, the analysis from interested companies is collected.
● Analysis from Huawei [25][26]
If all the nodes who are participating the coordinated transmission are
anchored for E-CID, e.g. non-collocated serving cell UE Rx-Tx time difference
was measured, the positioning performance can be increased due to the more
anchor nodes for location.
In CoMP, UE can be covered by several non-collocated serving cells on the same
frequency, and if UE Rx-Tx measurement can be performed on these non-
collocated serving cells, it can help to locate this UE in a exact place
rather than on a positioning circle derived by half of RTT (Round Trip Time).
Similarly, in CA, UE can be served by several non-collocated serving cell on
different component carriers (e.g. CA scenario 4), and if UE Rx-Tx measurement
can be performed on these non-collocated PCell and SCells, it can help to
locate this UE in a exact place rather than on a positioning circle derived by
half of RTT.
Proposal 1: the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement shall be extended to non-
collocated serving cells in CA.
Proposal 2: the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement shall be extended to non-
collocated serving cells in CoMP.
● Analysis from Alcatel-Lucent [27][28]
It would be beneficial to extend the UE Rx -- Tx time difference measurements
from the primary serving cell to all serving cells. The benefits are not
limited to E-CID positioning only. UE Rx -- Tx time difference measurements
from multiple serving cells may also be combined with other measurements, such
as RSTD measurements to enhance the positioning performance. In addition, UE
Rx -- Tx time difference measurements have one significant advantage over RSTD
measurements in that UE Rx -- Tx time difference measurements are independent
of cell time synchronization errors, which make UE Rx -- Tx time difference
measurements from multiple cells are desirable for the het-net deployment
scenarios where the time synchronization accuracy for RRH or small cells are
more difficult to be controlled than macro cells.
● Analysis from Ericsson [29]
Since release 10 and until now (release 12) the carrier aggregation
requirements have been developed or are being currently developed/studied in
RAN4 for the following scenarios:
1) Intra-band CA with 2 DL and 1 UL CC or 2 UL CC (Rel-10)
2) Inter-band CA with 2 DL and 1 UL CC (Rel-10)
3) Intra-band non-contiguous CA with 2 DL and 1 UL CC (Rel-11)
4) New carrier type as SCell: 2 DL CCs with 1 UL CC or 2 UL CCs -- (on-going
in Rel-12)
5) Inter-band CA with 2 DL and 2 UL CC (on-going in Rel-12)
6) Intra-band non-contiguous CA with 2 DL and 2 UL CC (on-going in Rel-12)
7) 3 DL involving 2 bands with 1 UL CC (just started in Rel-12)
The possible improvement could be that the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement is also performed on the SCell in addition to the existing one
done on the PCell. The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement involves both UL
and DL transmissions. Therefore in general CA scenarios 1 (with 2 UL CCs),
scenario 4 (with 2 UL CC), scenario 5 and scenario 6 listed above are relevant
for this measurement.
But in particular the additional measurement on SCell is likely to enhance
overall positioning accuracy when SCell is not co-located with the PCell.
Currently only the inter-band CA UE performance requirements (scenario 2) in
TS 36.101 are defined for non co-located deployment. These requirements are
expected to be extended also for scenario 5 (i.e. with 2 UL CCs) in release
12. In such deployment (i.e. scenario 5) the network will typically use
multiple TA (i.e. pTAG and sTAG) if the UE supports this capability. The UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurement itself could possibly be generically
defined. But it would be more reasonable that the corresponding requirements
are defined to be applicable only for practical deployment scenario e.g.
scenario 5. Nevertheless the benefit of having UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement on SCell needs further investigation.
### 8.2.2 Summary
Summary in this section is based on the analysis from interested companies in
section 8.2.1.
Benefits for E-CID positioning performance have been observed when the UE Rx-
Tx time difference measurement is performed on multiple serving cells in CA,
i.e., with the serving cells are on different carrier frequencies, with cells
being co-located or non-collocated.
