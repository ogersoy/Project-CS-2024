# 6 List of band specific issues for introduction of 1447-1467MHz Band
\- General issues
\- Coexistence with 3GPP bands
\- Coexistence with systems in adjacent spectrum
\- E-UTRA issues
\- BS filter
\- UE reference sensitivity power level
\- Spurious emissions and UE coexistence
# 7 General issues
## 7.1 Coexistence with 3GPP bands
For BS transmitter, the spurious emission requirements are -52dBm/MHz for co-
existence with DL band and -49 dBm/MHz for co-existence with UL band. Assuming
the emission in those spectrums after PA equals to the in-band spurious
emission, which is -15 dBm/MHz, the required attenuation from BS filter is
about 40 dB. For the new band the nearby 3GPP bands are Band 3 and Band 8.
Considering the large frequency separation between 1.4GHz band and Band 8 or
Band3, with appropriate filter design, BS coexistence with other 3GPP bands is
not an issue.
With the large frequency separations between the 1.4G band and Band 3 or 8
frequencies, UE can meet the standard -50 dBm/MHz requirement with normal
implementations. UE coexistence with other 3GPP bands is not an issue.
## 7.2 Coexistence with systems in adjacent spectrum
The other system spectrum around 1.4GHz in China is represented in Figure 5-1
of the TR. Above the band, it is broadcasting-satellite service and below the
band is downlink transmission for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. As a regional
regulatory activity, the coexistence study with systems in adjacent spectrum
has been performed to conclude the regional regulatory requirements, which is
shown in Table 5-2 of TR. Hence the coexistence with systems in adjacent
spectrum is not the scope of this WI.
# 8 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
## 8.1 BS filter
Table 8.1-1 shows the required attenuation for the BS filter to achieve the
coexistence. For coexistence with systems in adjacent spectrum, assuming that
5MHz guard band is used, the required attenuation is (47-15=) 32 dB. With the
large frequency separations between the 1.4G band and Band 3 or 8 frequencies,
we can consider the co-location case directly. The required attenuation is
(98-25=) 73 dB.
Table 8.1-1 General spurious emission requirements
* * *
Item Frequency range Rejection 1\~1347MHz ≥73dB 1400\~1430MHz ≥50dB
Coexistence with UAVs service 1430\~1442MHz ≥32dB Coexistence with
broadcasting-satellite service 1472\~1492MHz ≥32dB Co-located with GSM
1710\~1880MHz ≥73dB
* * *
A possible filter is shown in Figure 8.1-1, considering a 8 order cavity
filter with 2800 un-loaded Q value, The BS TX filter is larger than 40 dB
attenuation at 5 MH outside of the operating band and the insertion loss is
around 2dB. The attenuation at other 3GPP bands is larger than 90 dB. All the
filter characteristics shown are examples only and do not preclude other
implementations.

## 8.2 UE reference sensitivity power level
The 1.4GHz band is a TDD band without simultaneous Rx/Tx hence no Rx/Tx
isolation requirement is needed. The bandwidth is 20MHz and BW/F0 equals to
1.37% which will not bring difficulty for implementation. The reported
insertion loss values from different filter vendors are shown in Table 8.2-1.
The proposed reference sensitivity is shown in Table 8.2-2.

## 8.3 Spurious emissions and UE coexistence
The 1.4GHz band is targeted for China. Therefore we consider UE coexistence
with the bands which have been deployed or are likely to be in the near future
in China. These include bands 1, 3, 5, 8, 34, 39, 40, 41 42 and 44. In these
cases the frequency separation is large enough for the 1.4GHz band UE to meet
-50 dBm/MHz emission requirements.
