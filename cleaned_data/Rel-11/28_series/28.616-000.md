# 4 Solution Set Definitions
This specification defines the following 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and
non-3GPP access Interworking System NRM IRP Solution Set Definitions:
  * 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access Interworking System NRM IRP CORBA SS (Annex A)
  * 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access Interworking System NRM IRP XML Definitions (Annex B)
###### ## Annex A (normative): CORBA Solution Set
This annex contains the CORBA Solution Set for the IRP whose semantics is
specified in Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access Interworking System
NRM IRP: Information Service (TS 28.612 [4]).
# A.1 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP
access Interworking System Network Resources IRP is specified in 3GPP TS
28.612 [4].\ This clause specifies features that are specific to the CORBA SS.
## A.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
See clause A.1.1 of [8].
## A.1.2 Rules for NRM extensions
See clause A.1.2 of [8].
### A.1.2.1 Allowed extensions
See clause A.2.1 of [8].
### A.1.2.2 Extensions not allowed
See clause A.2.1 of [8].
# A.2 Mapping
## A.2.1 General mapping
See clause A.2.1 of [8].
## A.2.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
## A.3 Solution Set definitions
## A.3.1 IDL definition structure
Clause A.3.2 defines the MO classes for Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP
access Interworking System NRM IRP.
## A.3.2 IDL specification
###### ## Annex B (normative): XML Definitions
This annex contains the XML Definitions for the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and
non-3GPP access Interworking System NRM IRP as it applies to Itf-N, in
accordance with Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access Interworking
System NRM IRP IS definitions [4].
# B.1 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP
access Interworking System Network Resources IRP is specified in 3GPP TS
28.612 [4].\ This clause specifies features that are specific to the Schema
definitions.
The XML definitions of this document specify the schema for a configuration
content.
When using the XML definitions for a configuration file transfer with the Bulk
CM IRP, using either CORBA Solution Set of 3GPP TS 32.616 [7] or SOAP Solution
Set of 3GPP TS 32.616 [7], the basic part of the XML file format definition is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [7]. The XML definitions of this document provide
the schema for the configuration content to be included in such a
configuration file.
When using the XML definitions with a SOAP Solution Set of any Interface IRP
that perform operations on managed objects, for example the Basic CM IRP SOAP
SS of 3GPP TS 32.606 [6], the XML definitions of this document provides the
schema for the configuration content operated on by the interface IRP. Such
configuration content can be name of managed object and, if applicable, IOC
attributes.
## B.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
The syntax of a Distinguished Name is defined in 3GPP TS 32.300 [5].
# B.2 Mapping
### B.2.1 General mapping
An IOC maps to an XML element of the same name as the IOC\'s name in the IS.
An IOC attribute maps to a sub-element of the corresponding IOC\'s XML
element, and the name of this sub-element is the same as the attribute\'s name
in the IS.
### B.2.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
Not present in the current version of this specification.
# B.3 Solution Set definitions
## B.3.1 XML definition structure
The overall description of the file format of configuration data XML files is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [7].
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [7].
## B.3.2 Graphical Representation
Not present in the current version of this specification.
