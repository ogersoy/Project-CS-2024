  1. Concepts and background =======================
The architectures of enhancement for non-3GPP access (i.e. WLAN) to 3GPP
system are defined in TS 23.402[8]. In the TS 23.402, three kinds of
architectures are defined, using S2a, S2b and S2c interface separately. The
architectures of S2a and S2c don't introduce new network elements in 3GPP
system, while the architecture S2b introduces a new network element to support
the interworking:
\- Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG) (4.3.4 of [8]).
The above interworking related network element should be managed by 3GPP OAM,
and their corresponding NRM IRP need to be defined.
Based on the above characteristics, this specification defines the evolved
3GPP interworking WLAN NRM IRP requirements.
# 5 Requirements
The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present IRP:
A. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 [2].
B. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 [3].
C. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 [4].
In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements apply:
**REQ-EPC_WLAN-CON-001** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP shall
contain ePDG specific IOCs and related definitions. This requirement should be
satisfied when the S2b architecture is implemented.
**REQ-EPC_WLAN-CON-002** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP shall
contain 3GPP AAA specific IOCs and related definitions.
**Editor's note:** The requirements for the new introduced interfaces in EPC
and WLAN Interworking system are FFS.
