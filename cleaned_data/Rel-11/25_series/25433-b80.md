# 3 Definitions, Symbols and Abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
**CRNC Communication Context:** The CRNC Communication Context contains the
necessary information for the CRNC for communication with a specific UE. The
CRNC Communication Context is identified by the CRNC Communication Context ID.
**Elementary Procedure** : The NBAP protocol consists of Elementary Procedures
(EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between the CRNC and
the Node B.
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message.
Two kinds of EPs are used:
\- **Class 1** : Elementary Procedures with response (success or failure).
\- **Class 2** : Elementary Procedures without response.
For **Class 1** EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure has
been successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
**Class 2** EPs are considered always successful.
**Node B Communication Context:** The Node B Communication Context contains
the necessary information for the Node B for communication with a specific UE.
The Node B Communication Context is created by the Radio Link Setup procedure
and deleted by the Radio Link Deletion procedure when deleting the last Radio
Link within the Node B Communication Context. The Node B Communication Context
is identified by the Node B Communication Context ID.
**Prepared Reconfiguration:** A Prepared Reconfiguration exists when the
Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure has been
completed successfully. The Prepared Reconfiguration does not exist anymore
only after either of the procedures Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration
Commit or Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Cancellation has been
completed. In particular, the Prepared Reconfiguration still exists if the
object (e.g. Radio Link) concerned by the Synchronised Radio Link
Reconfiguration (e.g. in the case of an HS-DSCH Setup) is removed, but the
Node B Communication Context still exists.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional
behaviour of the Node B exactly and completely. The CRNC functional behaviour
is left unspecified. The Reset procedure is an exception from this principle.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure
text in subclause 8:
\- The procedure text discriminates between:
1) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports
procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST
message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message
used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an
appropriate cause value.
2) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if supported,\"
perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node
shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting
node about the not supported functionality.
\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not
explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response
message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, see section 10. For examples on how to use the
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, see Annex C.
## 4.2 Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a
mechanism in which all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of
related IEs, include Id and criticality fields that are coded in a standard
format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be
decoded regardless of the standard version.

# 5 NBAP Services
## 5.1 Parallel Transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure description, at any instance in
time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing dedicated NBAP
procedure related to a certain Node B Communication Context.
# 6 Services Expected from Signalling Transport
NBAP requires an assured in-sequence delivery service from the signalling
bearer, and notification if the assured in-sequence delivery service is no
longer available.
# 7 Functions of NBAP
The NBAP protocol provides the following functions:
\- Cell Configuration Management. This function gives the CRNC the possibility
to manage the cell configuration information in a Node B.
\- Common Transport Channel Management. This function gives the CRNC the
possibility to manage the configuration of Common Transport Channels in a Node
B.
\- System Information Management. This function gives the CRNC the ability to
manage the scheduling of System Information to be broadcast in a cell.
\- Resource Event Management. This function gives the Node B the ability to
inform the CRNC about the status of Node B resources.
\- Configuration Alignment. This function gives the CRNC and the Node B the
possibility to verify and enforce that both nodes have the same information on
the configuration of the radio resources.
\- Measurements on Common Resources. This function allows the CRNC to initiate
measurements on common resources in the Node B. The function also allows the
Node B to report the result of the measurements.
\- Radio Link Management. This function allows the CRNC to manage radio links
using dedicated resources in a Node B.
\- Radio Link Supervision. This function allows the CRNC to report failures
and restorations of a Radio Link.
\- Compressed Mode Control [FDD]. This function allows the CRNC to control the
usage of compressed mode in a Node B.
\- Measurements on Dedicated Resources. This function allows the CRNC to
initiate measurements on dedicated resources in the Node B. The function also
allows the Node B to report the result of the measurements.
\- DL Power Drifting Correction [FDD]. This function allows the CRNC to adjust
the DL power level of one or more Radio Links in order to avoid DL power
drifting between the Radio Links.
\- Reporting of General Error Situations. This function allows reporting of
general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not
been defined.
\- Physical Shared Channel Management. This function allows the CRNC to manage
physical resources in the Node B belonging to High Speed Downlink Shared
Channels and High Speed Shared Control Channels [TDD - and High Speed Shared
Indication Channels and Shared Channels (USCH/DSCH)].
\- DL Power Timeslot Correction [TDD]. This function enables the Node B to
apply an individual offset to the transmission power in each timeslot
according to the downlink interference level at the UE.
\- Cell Synchronisation [1.28 Mcps TDD and 3.84 Mcps TDD]. This function
allows the synchronisation of cells or Node Bs via the air interface.
\- Information Exchange. This function allows the CRNC to initiate information
provision from the Node B. The function also allows the Node B to report the
requested information.
\- Bearer Rearrangement. This function allows the Node B to indicate the need
for bearer re-arrangement for a Node B Communication Context. The function
also allows the CRNC to re-arrange bearers for a Node B Communication Context.
\- MBMS Notification. This function allows the CRNC to send MBMS Notification
indicators to the Node B to be broadcasted in a cell.
  * UE Status Notification [FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD]. This function > allows the CRNC to update UE related information stored in the > Node B.
  * Exchanging information about the secondary UL frequency. This > function allows the CRNC to transfer information about the > secondary UL frequency to the Node B and the Node B to transfer > information about the secondary UL frequency to SRNC in Dual-Cell > E-DCH operation.
The mapping between the above functions and NBAP elementary procedures is
shown in the table below.

# 8 NBAP Procedures
## 8.1 Elementary Procedures
NBAP procedures are divided into common procedures and dedicated procedures.
\- NBAP common procedures are procedures that request initiation of a Node B
Communication Context for a specific UE in Node B or are not related to a
specific UE. NBAP common procedures also incorporate logical O&M (TS 25.401
[1]) procedures.
\- NBAP dedicated procedures are procedures that are related to a specific
Node B Communication Context in Node B. This Node B Communication Context is
identified by a Node B Communication Context identity.
The two types of procedures may be carried on separate signalling links.
In the following tables, all EPs are divided into Class 1 and Class 2 EPs:

If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message contains the _FPACH_ IE,
the Node B shall configure and activate the indicated FPACH according to the
COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message.
Where more than one FPACH is defined, the FPACH that Node B should use is
defined by the UpPCH signature (SYNC_UL) code that the UE used. The FPACH
number = N mod M where N denotes the signature number (0..7) and M denotes the
number of FPACHs that are defined in a cell. The FPACH number is in ascending
order by _Common Physical Channel ID_ IE contained in the COMMON TRANSPORT

configure and activate the indicated E-RUCCH according to the COMMON TRANSPORT
CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message.
**RACH, FACH and PCH:**
If the _TNL QoS_ IE is included for a RACH, FACH or PCH and if ALCAP is not
used, the _TNL QoS_ IE may be used by the Node B to determine the transport
bearer characteristics to apply in the uplink between the Node B and the CRNC
for the related RACH, FACH or PCH.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message contains the _Broadcast
Reference_ IE in the _FACH Parameters_ IE, and one or more established FACH
common transport channels with the same Broadcast Reference, the same
Transport Format Set, the same ToAWS and the same ToAWE exist (all of them in
other distinct cells within the Node B), the Node B may include the _Broadcast
Common Transport Bearer Indication_ IE in the _Common Transport Channel
Information Response_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP RESPONSE
message to inform the CRNC that the existing transport bearer, identified by
_Broadcast Common Transport Bearer Indication_ IE, shall be used instead of
establishing a new transport bearer.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message contains the _Broadcast
Reference_ IE in the _FACH Parameters_ IE and no common transport channel with
the same Broadcast Reference, the same Transport Format Set, the same ToAWS
and the same ToAWE exists in another cell within the Node B, or if the Node B
decides to establish a new transport bearer, the Node B may store the value of
_Broadcast Reference_ IE.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message contains the _IP
Multicast Indication_ IE, and if supported, the Node B may join the indicated
IP multicast group if it has not done so yet (IETF RFC 3376 [41] in case of
IPv4, IETF RFC 3810 [42] in case of IPv6). If the Node B does join the IP
multicast group, or is already joined to the IP multicast group as a result of
a previous procedure, the Node B shall include the _IP Multicast Data Bearer
Indication_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL INFORMATION RESPONSE message to
inform the CRNC that the existing IP multicast transport bearer, identified by
_IP Multicast Indication_ IE in the corresponding COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL
SETUP REQUEST message, shall be used instead of using a IP unicast transport
bearer. If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL INFORMATION RESPONSE message does not
contain the _IP Multicast Data Bearer Indication_ IE, the CRNC shall send FACH
data frames on the IP unicast transport bearer. No matter whether the Node B
has joined the indicated IP multicast group, a new transport bearer shall be
established using the _Transport Layer Address_ IE and _Binding ID_ IE and
FACH specific control frames, e.g. TIMING ADJUSTMENT, shall be sent on the
established Iub transport bearer.
**General:**
After successfully configuring the requested common transport channels and the
common physical channels, the Node B shall store the value of _Configuration
Generation ID_ IE and it shall respond with the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP
RESPONSE message with the _Common Transport Channel ID_ IE, the _Binding ID_
IE (if no _Broadcast Common Transport Bearer Indication_ IE is included) and
the _Transport Layer Address_ IE (if no _Broadcast Common Transport Bearer
Indication_ IE is included) for the configured common transport channels.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message includes the _Transport
Layer Address_ and _Binding ID_ IEs, the Node B may use the transport layer
adress and the binding identifier received from the CRNC when establishing a
transport bearer for the indicated common transport channels.
After a successful procedure and once the transport bearers are established,
the configured common transport channels and the common physical channels
shall adopt the state Enabled (TS 25.430 [6]) in the Node B and the common
physical channels exist on the Uu interface.
#### 8.2.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 2: Common Transport Channel Setup procedure, Unsuccessful Operation
If the Node B is not able to support all or part of the configuration, it
shall reject the configuration of all the channels in the COMMON TRANSPORT
CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message. The channels in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL
SETUP REQUEST message shall remain in the same state as prior to the
procedure. The _Cause_ IE shall be set to an appropriate value. The value of
_Configuration Generation ID_ IE from the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP
REQUEST message shall not be stored.

Reference_ IE value already associated to an existing FACH in the same cell,
or if the message contains the same value for the _Broadcast Reference_ IEs
included in the _FACH Parameters_ IEs for several FACHs in the list of FACHs
defined on the Secondary CCPCH, the Node B shall reject the procedure, using
the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP FAILURE message.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message contains both the
_Broadcast Reference_ IE and the _IP Multicast Indication_ IE, the Node B
shall reject the procedure using the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP FAILURE
message.
[3.84Mcps TDD IMB - If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL SETUP REQUEST message
contains the _IMB Parameters_ IE that includes the _Last DL Channelisation
Code Number_ IE and if the Secondary CCPCH Slot Format IE is set to \"1\",
then the Node B shall reject the procedure using the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL

messages or the unit used in the event evaluation (i.e. same unit as for Fn)
_a_ = 1/2^(k/2)^ , where k is the parameter received in the _Measurement
Filter Coefficient_ IE. If the _Measurement Filter Coefficient_ IE is not

In order to initialise the averaging filter, _F~0~_ is set to _M~1~_ when the
first measurement result from the physical layer measurement is received.

### 8.2.16 System Information Update
#### 8.2.16.1 General
The System Information Update procedure performs the necessary operations in
order for the Node B to apply the correct scheduling of and/or to include the
appropriate contents to the system information segments broadcast on the BCCH.
#### 8.2.16.2 Successful Operation
{width="3.0625in" height="1.1333333333333333in"}
Figure 22: System Information Update procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message
sent from the CRNC to the Node B using the Node B Control Port.
The Node B shall consider the requested updates to the BCCH schedule in the
same order as the MIB/SB/SIB information is included in the SYSTEM INFORMATION
UPDATE REQUEST message.
If the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message includes the _BCCH
Modification Time_ IE, the updates to the BCCH schedule (possibly consisting
of IB occurrence additions, IB occurrence deletions and IB occurrence contents
updates) indicated in the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message shall be
applied by the Node B at the first time instance starting from the SFN value
set by the _BCCH Modification Time_ IE. If no _BCCH Modification Time_ IE is
included, the updates to the BCCH schedule shall be applied as soon as
possible.
**Information Block addition:\** If the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST
message includes segments of a certain MIB/SB/SIB, the Node B shall assume
that all segments for that Information Block are included in the message and
ordered with increasing Segment Index (starting from 0). For each included
segment, segment type information and _IB SG POS_ IE are also given in the
SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message.
The Node B shall determine the correct cell system frame number(s) (SFN) for
transmission of the segments of system information, from the scheduling
parameters provided in the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message. The SFN
for transmitting the segments shall be determined by the _IB SG REP_ IE and
_IB SG POS_ IE such that:
\- SFN mod IB_SG_REP = IB_SG_POS
If the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message contains Master Information
Block (MIB) segments in addition to SIB or SB segments, the MIB segments shall
first be sent in the physical channel by the Node B. Once these MIB segments
have been sent in the physical channel, the updated SB/SIB segments shall then
be sent in the physical channel.
Only if the inclusion of each new IB segment in the BCCH schedule leads to a
valid segment combination according to TS 25.331 [18], the Node B shall accept
the system information update.
If the _SIB Originator_ IE value is set to \"Node B\", the Node B shall create
the SIB segment of the SIB type given by the _IB Type_ IE and autonomously
update the SIB segment and apply the scheduling and repetition as given by the
_IB SG REP_ IE and _IB SG POS_ IE.
SIBs originating from the Node B can only be SIBs containing information that
the Node B can obtain on its own.
**Information Block deletion:\** If an IB Deletion is indicated in an instance
of _MIB/SB/SIB information_ IE in the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST
message, the Node B shall delete the IB indicated by the _IB Type_ IE and _IB
OC ID_ IE from the transmission schedule on BCCH.
**Information Block update:** \ If the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST
message contains segments for an IB without _IB SG REP_ IE and _IB SG POS_ IE
and there is already an IB in the BCCH schedule with the same IB Type and IB
OC ID which is not requested to be deleted from the BCCH schedule by an IB
deletion indicated in a _MIB/SB/SIB information_ IE repetition present in the
SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message before the IB segments are included,
then the Node B shall only update the contents of the IB segments without any
modification in segment scheduling.
If the Node B successfully completes the updating of the physical channel
scheduling cycle according to the parameters given in the SYSTEM INFORMATION
UPDATE REQUEST message, it shall respond to the CRNC with a SYSTEM INFORMATION
UPDATE RESPONSE message.
#### 8.2.16.3 Unsuccessful Operation
{width="3.0625in" height="1.1333333333333333in"}
Figure 23: System Information Update procedure, Unsuccessful Operation
If the Node B is unable to update the physical channel scheduling cycle
according to all the parameters given in the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST
message, it shall respond with a SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE FAILURE message
with an appropriate cause value.
The Node B shall not incorporate any of the requested changes into the
physical channel scheduling cycle, and the previous system information
configuration shall remain intact.
Typical cause values are:
**Radio Network Layer Cause:**
\- SIB Origination in Node B not Supported
**Miscellaneous Cause:**
\- Hardware failure
\- Control Processing overload
\- O&M Intervention
#### 8.2.16.4 Abnormal Conditions
The Node B shall reject, with the cause value \"SIB origination in Node B not
supported\", requests for Node B originated system information blocks that
make use of a value tag.
The Node B shall reject the requested update with cause value \"BCCH
scheduling error\" if:
\- After having handled a certain _MIB/SB/SIB information_ IE repetition, an
illegal BCCH schedule results;
\- If a _MIB/SB/SIB Information_ IE repetition includes an _IB SG REP_ IE or
an _IB SG POS_ IE and there is already an IB in the BCCH schedule with the
same IB Type and IB OC ID which is not requested to be deleted from the BCCH
schedule by an IB deletion indicated in a _MIB/SB/SIB information_ IE
repetition present in the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message before the
IB addition is indicated. This rule shall apply even if the scheduling
instructions in _IB SG REP_ IE and _IB SG POS_ IE were the same as the current
scheduling instructions for the concerned IB;
\- If a _MIB/SB/SIB Information_ IE repetition includes no _IB SG REP_ IE and
_IB SG POS_ IE and there is no IB in the BCCH schedule with the same IB Type
and IB OC ID;
\- If a _MIB/SB/SIB Information_ IE repetition includes no _IB SG REP_ IE and
_IB SG POS_ IE and there is already an IB in the BCCH schedule with the same
IB Type and IB OC ID but it is requested to be deleted from the BCCH schedule
by an IB deletion indicated in a _MIB/SB/SIB information_ IE repetition
present in the SYSTEM INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message before the IB
addition is indicated.
### 8.2.17 Radio Link Setup
#### 8.2.17.1 General
This procedure is used for establishing the necessary resources for a new Node
B Communication Context in the Node B.
[FDD - The Radio Link Setup procedure is used to establish one or more radio
links. The procedure establishes one or more DCHs on all radio links, and in
addition, it can include the establishment of an HS-DSCH on one radio link and
it can include the establishment of an E-DCH on one or more radio links.]
[TDD - The Radio Link Setup procedure is used to establish one radio link
including one or more transport channels. The transport channels can be a mix
of DCHs, DSCHs, and USCHs, or DCHs and an HS-DSCH, or DCHs, an HS-DSCH and an
E-DCH, including also combinations where one or more transport channel types
are not present.]
#### 8.2.17.2 Successful Operation
Figure 24: Radio Link Setup procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message sent from
the CRNC to the Node B using the Node B Control Port.
Upon reception of the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message, the Node B shall
reserve necessary resources and configure the new Radio Link(s) according to
the parameters given in the message.
The Node B shall prioritise resource allocation for the RL(s) to be
established according to Annex A.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is contained in the RADIO LINK SETUP
REQUEST message, the NodeB shall, if supported, store the received UE
Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate data rate of
non GBR traffic for this UE.
[FDD - If the _Usefulness of Battery Optimization_ IE is contained in the
RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message, the NodeB may store the received value and
use it to determine whether this UE can benefit from battery optimization
techniques.]
**Transport Channels Handling:**
**DCH(s):**
[TDD - If the _DCH Information_ IE is present, the Node B shall configure the
new DCH(s) according to the parameters given in the message.]
If the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message includes a _DCH Information_ IE with
multiple _DCH_ _Specific Info_ IEs, then the Node B shall treat the DCHs in
the _DCH Information_ IE as a set of co-ordinated DCHs. The Node B shall
include these DCHs in the new configuration only if it can include all of them
in the new configuration.
If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_ IE
set to \"Uplink DCH only\", the Node B shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_
IE for the downlink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as
a part of the downlink CCTrCH.
If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_ IE
set to \"Downlink DCH only\", the Node B shall ignore the _Transport Format
Set_ IE for the uplink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included
as a part of the uplink CCTrCH.
[FDD - For DCHs which do not belong to a set of co-ordinated DCHs with the
_QE-Selector_ IE set to \"selected\", the Transport channel BER from that DCH
shall be the base for the QE in the UL data frames. If no Transport channel
BER is available for the selected DCH, the Physical channel BER shall be used
for the QE, ref. TS 25.427 [16]. If the _QE-Selector_ IE is set to \"non-
selected\", the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE in the UL data
frames, ref. TS 25.427 [16].]
For a set of co-ordinated DCHs, the Transport channel BER from the DCH with
the _QE-Selector_ IE set to \"selected\" shall be used for the QE in the UL
data frames, ref. TS 25.427 [16]. [FDD - If no Transport channel BER is
available for the selected DCH, the Physical channel BER shall be used for the
QE, ref. TS 25.427 [16]. If all DCHs have _QE-Selector_ IE set to \"non-
selected\", the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE, ref. TS 25.427
[16]].
The Node B shall use the included _UL FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs as the FP Mode in the Uplink of the user plane for the DCH or
the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the configuration.
The Node B shall use the included _ToAWS_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs as the Time of Arrival Window Startpoint in the user plane for
the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the configuration.
The Node B shall use the included _ToAWE_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs as the Time of Arrival Window Endpoint in the user plane for
the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the configuration.
The received _Frame Handling Priority_ IE specified for each Transport Channel
should be used when prioritising between different frames in the downlink on
the radio interface in congestion situations within the Node B once the new
RL(s) has been activated.
If the _TNL QoS_ IE is included _for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs_ and
if ALCAP is not used, the _TNL QoS_ IE may be used by the Node B to determine
the transport bearer characteristics to apply in the uplink between the Node B
and the CRNC for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
[FDD - The _Diversity Control Field_ IE indicates for each RL (except the
first RL in the message) whether the Node B shall combine the concerned RL or
not.
\- If the _Diversity Control Field_ IE is set to\"May\", the Node B shall
decide for either of the alternatives.
\- If the _Diversity Control Field_ IE is set to \"Must\", the Node B shall
combine the RL with one of the other RL.
\- If the _Diversity Control Field_ IE is set to \"Must not\", the Node B
shall not combine the RL with any other existing RL.
The signalled _Diversity Control Field_ IE is applied to Dedicated Transport
Channels (DCH) only. In case of E-DCH it shall always be assumed to be set to
\"Must\". When a new RL is to be combined, the Node B shall choose which RL(s)
to combine it with.]
[FDD - In the RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message, the Node B shall indicate for
each RL with the _Diversity Indication_ in the _RL Information Response_ IE
whether the RL is combined or not.]
\- [FDD - In case of not combining with a RL previously listed in the RADIO
LINK SETUP RESPONSE message or for the first RL in the RADIO LINK SETUP

the RL(s) previously listed in this RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message with
which the concerned RL is combined and if the ALCAP is not used and the
transport bearer for the DCH is already established, the _Transport Layer
Address_ IE and the _Binding ID_ IE in the _RL Specific DCH Information_ IE
included in the _RL Information_ IE for a specific RL in the RADIO LINK SETUP
REQUEST message, shall not be used. In case of combining an E-DCH RL, one of

Information_ IE in the _RL Information_ IE, the Node B shall use this
information to configure the F-TPICH of the RL according to TS 25.211 [7] and
TS 25.214 [10].]
**[FDD - Radio Link Set Handling]:**
[FDD - The _First RLS Indicator_ IE indicates if the concerned RL shall be
considered part of the first RLS established towards this UE. The _First RLS
Indicator_ IE shall be used by the Node B together with the value of the _DL
TPC Pattern 01 Count_ IE which the Node B has received in the Cell Setup
procedure, to determine the initial TPC pattern in the DL of the concerned RL
and all RLs which are part of the same RLS, as described in TS 25.214 [10],
section 5.1.2.2.1.2.]
[FDD - For each RL not having a common generation of the TPC commands in the
DL with another RL, the Node B shall assign the _RL Set ID_ IE included in the
RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message a value that uniquely identifies the RL Set
within the Node B Communication Context. In case of E-DCH, the generation of

of the established RL Set(s), use the maximum value of the parameters
N_OUTSYNC_IND and T_RLFAILURE that are configured in the cells supporting the
radio links of the RL Set. The UL in-sync algorithm defined in TS 25.214 [10]
shall, for each of the established RL Set(s), use the minimum value of the
parameters N_INSYNC_IND, that are configured in the cells supporting the radio
links of the RL Set.]

information with another RL (current or future) when the Node B would contain
the E-DCH serving RL, the Node B shall include the _E-DCH RL Set ID_ IE in the
RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message. The value of the _E-DCH RL Set ID_ IE shall
allow the RNC to identify the E-DCH RLs that have or can have a common
generation of E-RGCH information.]
**Response Message:**
If the RLs are successfully established, the Node B shall and respond with a
RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message.
After sending the RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message the Node B shall
continuously attempt to obtain UL synchronisation on the Uu interface.
For each RL for which the _Delayed Activation_ IE is not included in the RADIO
LINK SETUP REQUEST message, the Node B shall:
\- [FDD - start transmission on the DL DPDCH(s) of the new RL as specified in
TS 25.427 [16].]

> 25.427 [16].]
For each RL for which the _Delayed Activation_ IE is included in the RADIO
LINK SETUP REQUEST message, the Node B shall:
\- if the _Delayed Activation_ IE indicates \"Separate Indication\":
\- not start any DL transmission for the concerned RL on the Uu interface;
\- if the _Delayed Activation_ IE indicates \"CFN\":
\- [FDD - start transmission on the DL DPDCH(s) of the new RL as specified in
TS 25.427 [16], however never before the CFN indicated in the _Activation CFN_
IE.]
\- [TDD - start transmission on the new RL at the CFN indicated in the
_Activation CFN_ IE as specified in TS 25.427 [16].]

indicate this in the RADIO LINK SETUP FAILURE message in the same way as in
the RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message. In this case, the Node B shall include
the _Communication Control Port Id_ IE in the RADIO LINK SETUP FAILURE
message.]
[FDD - If the RL identified by the _HS-PDSCH RL ID_ IE is a radio link in the
Node B and this RL is successfully established, then the Node B shall include
the _HS-DSCH FDD Information Response_ IE in the RADIO LINK SETUP FAILURE
message.]
[FDD - If the RL identified by the _HS-PDSCH RL ID_ IE in the _Additional HS
Cell Information RL Setup_ IE is a radio link in the Node B and this RL is
successfully established, then the Node B shall include the _HS-DSCH FDD
Secondary Serving Information Response_ IE in the _Additional HS Cell

successfully established, then the Node B shall include the _Additional E-DCH
FDD Information Response_ IE in the _Additional E-DCH Cell Information
Response_ IE in the RADIO LINK SETUP FAILURE message in the same way as in the
RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message. If the establishment of the RL identified

### 8.2.21 Cell Synchronisation Reconfiguration [TDD]
#### 8.2.21.1 General
This procedure is used by a CRNC to reconfigure the transmission of
**[3.84Mcps TDD - C** ell Synchronisation Bursts] [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL
Code] and/or to reconfigure measurements on **[3.84Mcps TDD - C** ell
Synchronisation Bursts] [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL Code] in a Node B.
#### 8.2.21.2 Successful Operation
##### 8.2.21.2.1 General
Figure 27E Cell Synchronisation Reconfiguration procedure, Successful
Operation
The procedure is initiated with a CELL SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION REQUEST
message sent from the CRNC to the Node B using the Node B Control Port.
Upon reception, the Node B shall reconfigure the **[3.84Mcps TDD - C** ell
Synchronisation Burst] [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL Code] transmission and/or
measurements according to the parameters given in the request.
##### 8.2.21.2.2 [3.84Mcps TDD - Cell Sync Burst Schedule]
Within the CELL SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message first the
schedule for the steady state phase is fixed. I.e. the number of cycles per
SFN period is defined with the same schedule. For each cycle, the number of
repetitions is defined according to following equations:
Cycle length: 4096 / value of _Number Of Cycles Per SFN Period_ IE
Repetition period: Cycle length / value of _Number Of Repetitions Per Cycle
Period_ IE
Cell Sync Frame number is calculated by:\ SFN = floor((k-1) * Cycle length +
(i-1)* Repetition period)
k = {1, 2, 3, .. Number of cycle per SFN period}
i = {1, 2, 3, .. Cell Sync Frame number within cycle period}
##### 8.2.21.2.3 [1.28Mcps TDD - SYNC_DL Code Schedule]
Within the CELL SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message first the
schedule for the steady state phase is fixed. The \"schedule\" includes
\- the list of frame numbers SFN within the SFN period where SYNC_DL Code
transmission or reception takes place, i.e. the \"synchronisation frames\",
and
\- the associated actions (SYNC_DL Code transmission, reception, averaging,
reporting etc) to be performed for synchronisation purpose by the Node B at
each of these SFNs.
Within the synchronisation frames, only the first subframe shall be used for
sending or receiving a SYNC_DL Code in the DwPTS while in the second subframe,
normal operation continues.
The synchronisation schedule includes the option of averaging of measured
correlation results within the Node B over a sequence of measurements, for
increasing the reliability of the Time of Arrival measurement obtained from
the correlation results. For this purpose, the concept of \"subcycles\" has
been introduced: Each Synchronisation Cycle is devided into \"subcycles\"
where in each subcycle, the same set of SYNC_DL transmissions and receptions
is performed, and averaging takes place over all the subcycles within a
Synchronisation Cycle. Since the list of actions (transmission, measurements
etc) is the same in each subcycle, and the subcycles are repeated to make up a
cycle, and the cycles make up an SFN period, the full list of actions is
derived by the actions specified for a subcycle.
The full list of SFNs which make up the synchronisation schedule within the
SFN period are calculated in Node B and CRNC autonomously based on the
following parameters included in the CELL SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION
REQUEST message: \"Number of cycles per SFN period\", \"Number of subcycles
per cycle period\", and \"Number of repetitions per cycles period\", along the
following equations:
Cycle length: 4096 / value of _Number Of Cycles Per SFN Period_ IE
Subcycle length: Cycle length / value of _Number Of Subcycles Per Cycle
Period_ IE
Repetition period: Subcycle length / value of _Number Of Repetitions Per Cycle
Period_ IE
SFN = floor((k-1) * Cycle length + (j-1)*Subcycle length + (i-1)* Repetition
period)
k = {1, 2, 3, .. Number of cycle per SFN period}
j = {1, 2, 3, .. Number of subcycles per cycle}
i = {1, 2, 3, .. Number of repetitions per cycle period}
Note that if the _Number Of Subcycles Per Cycle_ IE is equal to 1, then the
subcycles are identical to the \"Synchronisation Cycles\".
If the _Number Of Subcycles Per Cycle_ IE is included in the CELL
SYNCHRONISATION RECONFIGURATION REQUEST [TDD] message, then the Node B shall
apply this number for dividing the Synchronisation Cycles in Subcycles. If the
IE is not present, then the Node B shall assume that there is one subcycle per
synchronisation cycle only, which is identical to the synchronisation cycle.
Averaging is performed as follows:
\- From each SYNC_DL code being received according to the schedule, the Node B
shall calculate a \"correlation function\" by matching the received data with
the respective expected code.
\- Therefore the set of measurements within one subcycle provides a set of
\"correlation functions\".
\- The set of correlation functions of the first subcycle within a
synchronisation cycle is stored in an averaging memory.
\- The sets of correlation functions of the subsequent subcycles within a
synchronisation cycle are combined with the available contents of the
\"averaging memory\", to produce an average over all the sets of correlation
functions within a synchronisation cycle.
\- At the end of a synchronisation cycle, the Time-of-Arrival measurements for
that synchronisation cycle are obtained by evaluating the final set of
correlation functions.
These Time-of-Arrival measurements, together with associated SIR values
obtained from the averaged correlation functions, are included in a
Measurement Report to the CRNC, according to a measurement reporting plan.
In addition, the Time-of-Arrival measurements may optionally be used for
autonomous self-adjustment of the timing of the respective cell.

### 8.3.2 Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation
#### 8.3.2.1 General
The Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure is used to
prepare a new configuration of Radio Link(s) related to one Node B
Communication Context.
The Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure shall not be
initiated if a Prepared Reconfiguration exists, as defined in subclause 3.1.
#### 8.3.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 30: Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure,
Successful Operation
The Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure is initiated
by the CRNC by sending the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE message to the
Node B. The message shall use the Communication Control Port assigned for this
Node B Communication Context.
Upon reception, the Node B shall reserve necessary resources for the new
configuration of the Radio Link(s) according to the parameters given in the
message. Unless specified below, the meaning of parameters is specified in
other specifications.
The Node B shall prioritise resource allocation for the RL(s) to be modified
according to Annex A.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is contained in the RADIO LINK
RECONFIGURATION PREPARE message, the NodeB shall, if supported, store the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate
data rate of non GBR traffic for this UE.
**DCH Modification:**
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE message includes any _DCHs To
Modify_ IE then the Node B shall treat them each as follows:
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _Frame Handling Priority_ IE, the
Node B should store this information for this DCH in the new configuration.
The received Frame Handling Priority should be used when prioritising between
different frames in the downlink on the radio interface in congestion
situations within the Node B once the new configuration has been activated.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the
UL of a DCH, the Node B shall apply the new Transport Format Set in the Uplink
of this DCH in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _TNL QoS_ IE for a DCH or a set of
co-ordinated DCHs to be modified and if ALCAP is not used, the Node B may
store this information for this DCH in the new configuration. The _TNL QoS_ IE
may be used to determine the transport bearer characteristics to apply in the
uplink for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the
DL of a DCH, the Node B shall apply the new Transport Format Set in the
Downlink of this DCH in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE
for a DCH, the Node B shall apply the new Allocation/Retention Priority to
this DCH in the new configuration according to Annex A.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes multiple _DCH Specific Info_ IEs, the
Node B shall treat the DCHs in the _DCHs to Modify_ IE as a set of co-
ordinated DCHs. The Node B shall include these DCHs in the new configuration
only if it can include all of them in the new configuration.
\- [FDD - If the _DCHs to Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _Unidirectional DCH indicator_ IE set to \"Uplink DCH only\", the
Node BNode B shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the downlink for
this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the downlink
CCTrCH.]
\- [FDD - If the _DCHs to Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _Unidirectional DCH indicator_ IE set to \"Downlink DCH only\",
the Node BNode B shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the uplink for
this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the uplink
CCTrCH.]
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _UL FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a DCH
which belongs to a set of co-ordinated DCHs, the Node B shall apply the new FP
Mode in the Uplink of the user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated
DCHs in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _ToAWS_ IE for a DCH or a DCH which

If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE message includes any _DCHs To Add_
IEs then the Node B shall treat them each as follows:
\- If the _DCHs To Add_ IE includes multiple _DCH Specific Info_ IEs, the Node
B shall treat the DCHs in the _DCHs To Add_ IE as a set of co-ordinated DCHs.
The Node B shall include these DCHs in the new configuration only if it can
include all of them in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_
IE set to \"Uplink DCH only\", the Node B shall ignore the _Transport Format
Set_ IE for the downlink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not
included as a part of the downlink CCTrCH.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_
IE set to \"Downlink DCH only\", the Node B shall ignore the _Transport Format
Set_ IE for the uplink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included
as a part of the uplink CCTrCH.
\- [FDD - For DCHs which do not belong to a set of co-ordinated DCHs with the
_QE-Selector_ IE set to \"selected\", the Transport channel BER from that DCH
shall be the base for the QE in the UL data frames. If no Transport channel
BER is available for the selected DCH, the Physical channel BER shall be used
for the QE, ref. TS 25.427 [16]. If the _QE-Selector_ IE is set to \"non-
selected\", the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE in the UL data
frames, ref. TS 25.427 [16].]
\- For a set of co-ordinated DCHs, the Transport channel BER from the DCH with
the _QE-Selector_ IE set to \"selected\" shall be used for the QE in the UL
data frames, ref. TS 25.427 [16]. [FDD - If no Transport channel BER is
available for the selected DCH, the Physical channel BER shall be used for the
QE, ref. TS 25.427 [16]. If all DCHs have the _QE-Selector_ IE set to \"non-
selected\", the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE, ref. TS 25.427
[16].]
\- The Node B should store the _Frame Handling Priority_ IE received for a DCH
to be added in the new configuration. The received Frame Handling Priority
should be used when prioritising between different frames in the downlink on
the Uu interface in congestion situations within the Node B once the new
configuration has been activated.
\- If the _TNL QoS_ IE is included for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs and
if ALCAP is not used, the Node B may store this information for this DCH in
the new configuration. The _TNL QoS_ IE may be used to determine the transport
bearer characteristics to apply for the uplink between the Node B and the CRNC
for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
\- The Node B shall use the included _UL FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new FP Mode in the Uplink of the user plane
for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new configuration.
\- The Node B shall use the included _ToAWS_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new Time of Arrival Window Startpoint in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.

### 8.3.5 Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration
#### 8.3.5.1 General
The Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure is used to reconfigure
Radio Link(s) related to one UE-UTRAN connection within a Node B.
The Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure is used when there is
no need to synchronise the time of the switching from the old to the new
configuration in one Node B used for a UE-UTRAN connection with any other Node
B also used for the UE--UTRAN connection.
The Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure shall not be initiated
if a Prepared Reconfiguration exists, as defined in subclause 3.1.
#### 8.3.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 34: Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Procedure, Successful
Operation
The Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure is initiated by the

The message shall use the Communication Control Port assigned for this Node B
Communication Context.
Upon reception, the Node B shall modify the configuration of the Radio Link(s)
according to the parameters given in the message. Unless specified below, the

data rate of non GBR traffic for this UE.
**DCH Modification:**
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes any _DCHs To
Modify_ IE then the Node B shall treat them each as follows:
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _Frame Handling Priority_ IE, the
Node B should store this information for this DCH in the new configuration.
The received Frame Handling Priority should be used when prioritising between

within the Node B once the new configuration has been activated.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _TNL QoS_ IE for a DCH or a set of
co-ordinated DCHs to be modified and if ALCAP is not used, the Node B may
store this information for this DCH in the new configuration. The _TNL QoS_ IE
may be used to determine the transport bearer characteristics to apply for the
uplink between the Node B and the CRNC for the related DCH or set of co-
ordinated DCHs.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the

this DCH in the new configuration according to Annex A.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes multiple _DCH Specific Info_ IEs, then
the Node B shall treat the DCHs in the _DCHs To Modify_ IE as a set of co-
ordinated DCHs. The Node B shall include these DCHs in the new configuration
only if it can include all of them in the new configuration.
\- [FDD - If the _DCHs to Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _Unidirectional DCH indicator_ IE set to \"Uplink DCH only\", the
Node B shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the downlink for this
DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the downlink
CCTrCH.]
\- [FDD - If the _DCHs to Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _Unidirectional DCH indicator_ IE set to \"Downlink DCH only\",
the Node B shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the uplink for this
DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the uplink
CCTrCH.]
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _UL FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a set
of co-ordinated DCHs, the Node B shall apply the new FP Mode in the Uplink of
the user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new

_CCTrCH ID_ IE for the UL of a DCH to be modified, the Node B shall apply the
new CCTrCH ID in the Uplink of this DCH in the new configuration.]
**DCH Addition:**
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes any _DCH To Add_
IE, the Node B shall reserve necessary resources for the new configuration of
the Radio Link(s) according to the parameters given in the message and include
these DCHs in the new configuration. In particular:
\- If a _DCHs To Add_ IE includes multiple _DCH Specific Info_ IEs for a DCH
to be added, the Node B shall treat the DCHs in the _DCHs To Add_ IE as a set
of co-ordinated DCHs. The Node B shall include these DCHs in the new
configuration only if it can include all of them in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_
IE set to \"Uplink DCH only\", the Node B shall ignore the _Transport Format
Set_ IE for the downlink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not
included as a part of the downlink CCTrCH.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_
IE set to \"Downlink DCH only\", the Node B shall ignore the _Transport Format
Set_ IE for the uplink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included
as a part of the uplink CCTrCH.
\- [FDD - For DCHs which do not belong to a set of co-ordinated DCHs with the
_QE-Selector_ IE set to \"selected\", the Node B shall use the Transport
channel BER from that DCHas the base for the QE in the UL data frames. If no
Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH, the Physical channel
BER shall be used for the QE TS 25.427 [16]. If the _QE-Selector_ IE is set to
\"non-selected\", the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE in the UL
data frames, ref. TS 25.427 [16].]
\- For a set of co-ordinated DCHs, the Node B shall use the Transport channel
BER from the DCH with the _QE-Selector_ IE set to \"selected\" as the QE in
the UL data frames TS 25.427 [16]. [FDD - If no Transport channel BER is
available for the selected DCH, the Physical channel BER shall be used for the
QE TS 25.427 [16]. If all DCHs have the _QE-Selector_ IE set to \"non-
selected\", the Physical channel BER shall be used for the QE TS 25.427 [16].]
\- The Node B should store the _Frame Handling Priority_ IE received for a DCH
to be added in the new configuration. The received Frame Handling Priority
should be used when prioritising between different frames in the downlink on
the Uu interface in congestion situations within the Node B once the new
configuration has been activated.
\- If the _TNL QoS_ IE is included for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs and
if ALCAP is not used, the Node B may store this information for this DCH in
the new configuration. The _TNL QoS_ IE may be used to determine the transport
bearer characteristics to apply for the uplink between the Node B and the CRNC
for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
\- The Node B shall use the included _UL FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new FP Mode in the Uplink of the user plane
for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new configuration.
\- The Node B shall use the included _ToAWS_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new Time of Arrival Window Startpoint in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.

### 8.3.6 Radio Link Deletion
#### 8.3.6.1 General
The Radio Link Deletion procedure is used to release the resources in a Node B
for one or more established radio links towards a UE.
The Radio Link Deletion procedure may be initiated by the CRNC at any time
when the Node B Communication Context exists.
#### 8.3.6.2 Successful Operation
Figure 36: Radio Link Deletion procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a RADIO LINK DELETION REQUEST message sent
from the CRNC to the Node B using the Communication Control Port assigned to
the concerned Node B Communication Context.
Upon receipt of this message, the Node B shall delete the radio link(s)
identified by the _RL ID_ IE _, Node B Communication Context ID_ IE _and CRNC
Communication Context ID_ IE and release all associated resources and respond
to the CRNC with a RADIO LINK DELETION RESPONSE message.
[FDD - After deletion of the RL(s), the UL out-of-sync algorithm defined in
ref. TS 25.214 [10] shall for each of the remaining RL Set(s) use the maximum
value of the parameters N_OUTSYNC_IND and T_RLFAILURE that are configured in

### 8.3.7 Downlink Power Control [FDD]
#### 8.3.7.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to balance the DL transmission powers of one
or more Radio Links used for the related UE-UTRAN connection within the Node
B. The Downlink Power Control procedure may be initiated by the CRNC at any
time when the Node B Communication Context exists, irrespective of other
ongoing CRNC initiated dedicated NBAP procedures towards this Node B
Communication Context. The only exception occurs when the CRNC has requested
the deletion of the last RL via this Node B, in which case the Downlink Power
Control procedure shall no longer be initiated.
#### 8.3.7.2 Successful Operation
Figure 37: Downlink Power Control procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated by the CRNC sending a DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST
message to the Node B using the Communication Control Port assigned to the
concerned Node B Communication Context.
The _Power Adjustment Type_ IE defines the characteristic of the power
adjustment.
If the value of the _Power Adjustment Type_ IE is _\"Common\"_ , the Power
Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B Communication Context shall be set to
\"Common\". As long as the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B
Communication Context is set to \"Common\", the Node B shall perform the power
adjustment (see below) for all existing and future radio links associated with
the context identified by the _Node B Communication Context ID_ IE and use a
common DL reference power level.
If the value of the _Power Adjustment Type_ IE is _\"Individual\"_ , the Power
Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B Communication Context shall be set to
\"Individual\". The Node B shall perform the power adjustment (see below) for
all radio links addressed in the message using the given DL Reference Powers
per RL. If the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B Communication
Context was set to \"Common\" before this message was received, power
balancing on all radio links not addressed by the DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST
message shall remain to be executed in accordance with the existing power
balancing parameters which are now considered RL individual parameters. Power
balancing will not be started on future radio links without a specific
request.
If the value of the _Power Adjustment Type_ IE is \"None\", the Power
Balancing Adjustment Type of the Node B Communication Context shall be set to
\"None\" and the Node B shall suspend on going power adjustments for all radio
links for the Node B Communication Context.
If the _Inner Loop DL PC Status_ IE is present and set to \"Active\", the Node
B shall activate inner loop DL power control for all radio links for the Node
B Communication Context. If the _Inner Loop DL PC Status_ IE is present and
set to \"Inactive\", the Node B shall deactivate inner loop DL power control
for all radio links for the Node B Communication Context according to ref. TS
25.214 [10].
**Power Adjustment**
The power balancing adjustment shall be superimposed on the inner loop power
control adjustment (see ref. TS 25.214 [10]) if activated. The power balancing
adjustment shall be such that:
$\sum_{}^{}P_{\text{bal}} = (1 - r)(P_{\text{ref}} + P_{P - \text{CPICH}} -
P_{\text{init}})$ with an accuracy of ±0.5 dB
where the sum is performed over an adjustment period corresponding to a number
of frames equal to the value of the _Adjustment Period_ IE, _P~ref~_ is the

primary CPICH, _P~init~_ is the code power of the last slot of the previous
adjustment period and _r_ is given by the _Adjustment Ratio_ IE. If the last
slot of the previous adjustment period is within a transmission gap due to
compressed mode, _P~init~_ shall be set to the same value as the code power of
the slot just before the transmission gap.
The adjustment within one adjustment period shall in any case be performed
with the constraints given by the _Max Adjustment Step_ IE and the DL TX power
range set by the CRNC.
The power adjustments shall be started at the first slot of a frame with CFN

### 8.3.8 Dedicated Measurement Initiation
#### 8.3.8.1 General
This procedure is used by a CRNC to request the initiation of measurements on
dedicated resources in a Node B.
The Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure shall not be initiated if a
Prepared Reconfiguration exists, as defined in subclause 3.1 except when the
_Node B Communication Context ID_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION
REQUEST message is set to the reserved value \"All NBCC\".
If the _Node B Communication Context ID_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT
INITIATION REQUEST message is set to the reserved value \"All NBCC\", the
Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure may be initiated by the CRNC at any
time when the Node B Communication Context exists.
#### 8.3.8.2 Successful Operation
Figure 38: Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message sent from the CRNC to the Node B using the Communication Control Port
assigned to the Node B Communication Context.
Upon reception, the Node B shall initiate the requested measurement according
to the parameters given in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message. Unless specified below the meaning of the parameters are given in
other specifications.
If the _Node B Communication Context ID_ IE equals the reserved value \"All
NBCC\", this measurement request shall apply for all current and future Node B
Communication Contexts controlled via the Communication Control Port on which
the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message was received. Otherwise,
this measurement request shall apply for the requested Node B Communication
Context ID only.
If the _Node B Communication Context ID_ IE equals the reserved value \"All
NBCC\", the measurement request shall be treated as a single measurement,
despite applying to multiple contexts. This means that it may only be
terminated or failed on \"All NBCC\".
If the _Node B Communication Context ID_ IE equals the reserved value \"All
NBCC\", the measurement shall be initiated only for those Node B Communication
Contexts handling a mode (FDD, 3.84Mcps TDD, 7.68Mcps TDD or 1.28Mcps TDD) for
which the concerned measurement is specified in TS 25.215 [4] and TS 25.225
[5]. The initiation of the measurement for a Node B Communication Context may
be delayed until the Reconfiguration CFN has elapsed if either a Prepared
Reconfiguration exists or a Prepared Reconfiguration no longer exists but the
Reconfiguration CFN has not yet elapsed.
If the _Dedicated Measurement Object Type_ is indicated as being \"RL\" in the
DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement results shall be
reported for all indicated Radio Links.

RL\" in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement
results shall be reported for one existing DPCH per CCTrCH in each used time
slot of current and future Radio Links within the Node B Communication
Context, provided the measurement type is applicable to the respective DPCH.]
[FDD - If the _Dedicated Measurement Object Type_ is indicated as being \"ALL
RLS\" in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement
results shall be reported for all existing and future Radio Link Sets within
the Node B Communication Context.]
[TDD - If the _DPCH_ _ID_ IE or _DPCH ID 7.68Mcps_ IE is provided within the
RL Information, the measurement request shall apply for the requested physical
channel individually. If no _DPCH ID_ IE, _HS-SICH ID_ IE, _DPCH ID 7.68Mcps_
IE and no _PUSCH Information_ IE is provided within the RL Information, the
measurement request shall apply for one existing physical channel per CCTrCH
in each used time slot of the Radio Link, provided the measurement type is
applicable to this physical channel.]
[TDD - If the _PUSCH Information_ IE is provided within the RL Information,
the measurement request shall apply for the requested physical channel
individually.]
[TDD - If the _HS-SICH Information_ IE is provided within the RL Information,
the measurement request shall apply for the requested physical channel
individually.]
[TDD - If the _Dedicated Measurement Type_ IE is set to \"HS-SICH reception
quality \", the Node B shall initiate measurements of the failed, missed and
total HS-SICH transmissions on all of the HS-SICH assigned to this Node B
Communication Context. If either the failed or missed HS-SICH transmission
satisfies the requested report characteristics, the Node B shall report the
result of both failed and missed transmission measurements along with the
total number of transmissions.]
If the _CFN Reporting Indicator_ IE is set to \"FN Reporting Required\", the
_CFN_ IE shall be included in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT message or in
the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message, the latter only in the
case the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"On Demand\". The reported CFN
shall be the CFN at the time when the measurement value was reported by the
layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement model (TS 25.302
[25]).
[FDD - If the _Number Of Reported Cell Portions_ IE is included in the
DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the value shall be used to
determine how many _Cell Portion ID_ IEs and _SIR Value_ IEs shall be included
in _Best Cell Portions_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT message or in
the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.]
[1.28Mcps TDD - If the _Number Of Reported Cell Portions_ _LCR_ IE is included
in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the value shall be
used to determine how many _Cell Portion LCR ID_ IEs and _RSCP Value_ IEs
shall be included in _Best Cell Portions LCR_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT
REPORT message or in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.
[1.28Mcps TDD - If the _Dedicated Measurement Type_ IE is set to \"AOA per
Cell Portion LCR\", the Node B shall initiate measurements of the Angle Of
Arrival LCR for all Best CELL Portions in the CELL.]
**Report characteristics\** The _Report Characteristics_ IE indicates how the
reporting of the measurement shall be performed. See also Annex B.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"On Demand\" and if the _CFN_ IE
is not provided, the Node B shall return the result of the measurement
immediately. If the _CFN_ IE is provided, it indicates the frame for which the
measurement value shall be provided. The provided measurement value shall be
the one reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the
measurement model (TS 25.302 [25]).
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Periodic\", the Node B shall
periodically initiate the Dedicated Measurement Report procedure for this
measurement, with the requested report frequency. If the _CFN_ IE is provided,
it indicates the frame for which the first measurement value of a periodic
reporting shall be provided. The provided measurement value shall be the one
reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement
model (TS 25.302 [25]).
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event A\", the Node B shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity rises above the requested threshold and stays there for the requested
hysteresis time. If the _Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included,
the Node B shall use the value zero for the hysteresis time.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event B\", the Node B shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity falls below the requested threshold and stays there for the requested
hysteresis time. If the _Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included,
the Node B shall use the value zero for the hysteresis time.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event C\", the Node B shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity rises by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the
requested time. After having reported this type of event, the next C event
reporting for the same measurement cannot be initiated before the rising time
specified by the _Measurement Change Time_ IE has elapsed since the previous
event reporting.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event D\", the Node B shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity falls by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the
requested time. After having reported this type of event, the next D event
reporting for the same measurement cannot be initiated before the falling time
specified by the _Measurement Change Time_ IE has elapsed since the previous
event reporting.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event E\", the Node B shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity rises above the \'Measurement Threshold 1\' and stays there for the
\'Measurement Hysteresis Time\' (Report A). When the conditions for Report A
are met and the _Report Periodicity_ IE is provided, the Node B shall also
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure periodically. If the
conditions for Report A have been met and the measured entity falls below the
\'Measurement Threshold 2\' and stays there for the \'Measurement Hysteresis
Time\', the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting
procedure (Report B) as well as terminate any corresponding periodic
reporting. If the _Measurement Threshold 2_ IE is not present, the Node B
shall use the value of the _Measurement Threshold 1_ IE instead. If the
_Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included, the Node B shall use the
value zero as hysteresis times for both Report A and Report B.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event F\", the Node B shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity falls below the \'Measurement Threshold 1\' and stays there for the
\'Measurement Hysteresis Time\' (Report A). When the conditions for Report A
are met and the _Report Periodicity_ IE is provided, the Node B shall also
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure periodically. If the
conditions for Report A have been met and the measured entity rises above the
\'Measurement Threshold 2\' and stays there for the \'Measurement Hysteresis
Time\', the Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting
procedure (Report B) as well as terminate any corresponding periodic
reporting. If the _Measurement Threshold 2_ IE is not present, the Node B
shall use the value of the _Measurement Threshold 1_ IE instead. If the
_Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included, the Node B shall use the
value zero as hysteresis times for both Report A and Report B.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"On Modification\" and if the
_SFN_ IE is not provided, the Node B shall report the result of the requested
measurement immediately. If the _SFN_ IE is provided, it indicates the frame
for which the measurement value shall be provided. Then, the Node B shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure in accordance to the
following conditions:
  1. If the _Dedicated_ _Measurement Type_ IE is set to \"Best Cell Portions LCR\":
\- The Node B shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure
when the Dedicated Measurement Value \"Best Cell Portions LCR\" changes.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is not set to \"On Demand\", the Node B is
required to perform reporting for a dedicated measurement object, in
accordance with the conditions provided in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT
INITIATION REQUEST message, as long as the object exists. If no dedicated
measurement object for which a measurement is defined exists anymore, the Node
B shall terminate the measurement locally, i.e. without reporting this to the
CRNC.
If at the start of the measurement, the reporting criteria are fulfilled for
any of Event A, Event B, Event E or Event F, the Node B shall initiate the
Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure immediately, and then continue with
the measurements as specified in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message.
**Higher layer filtering\** The _Measurement Filter Coefficient_ IE indicates
how filtering of the measurement values shall be performed before measurement
event evaluation and reporting.
The averaging shall be performed according to the following formula.
$F_{n} = (1 - a) \cdot F_{n - 1} + a \cdot M_{n}$
The variables in the formula are defined as follows
_F~n~_ is the updated filtered measurement result
_F~n-1~_ is the old filtered measurement result
_M~n~_ is the latest received measurement result from physical layer
measurements, the unit used for _M~n~_ is the same unit as the reported unit
in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE, DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT
messages or the unit used in the event evaluation (i.e. same unit as for Fn)
_a_ = 1/2^(k/2)^ , where k is the parameter received in the _Measurement
Filter Coefficient_ IE. If the _Measurement Filter Coefficient_ IE is not
present, _a_ shall be set to 1 (no filtering)
In order to initialise the averaging filter, _F~0~_ is set to _M~1~_ when the
first measurement result from the physical layer measurement is received.
**Measurement Recovery Behavior:**
If the _Measurement Recovery Behavior_ IE is included in the DEDICATED
MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the Node B shall, if Measurement
Recovery Behavior is supported, include the _Measurement Recovery Support
Indicator_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message and
perform the Measurement Recovery Behavior as described in subclause 8.3.9.2.
**Response message\** If the Node B was able to initiate the measurement
requested by the CRNC, it shall respond with the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT
INITIATION RESPONSE message using the Communication Control Port assigned to
the Node B Communication Context. The message shall include the same
Measurement ID that was used in the measurement request. The DEDICATED
MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message shall be sent even if the initiation
is delayed for some Node B Communication Contexts due to an existing Prepared
Reconfiguration or that the Reconfiguration CFN has not yet elapsed.
Only in the case where the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"On
Demand\", the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message shall include
the _Dedicated Measurement Object Type_ IE containing the measurement result.
[TDD - In the case that the measurement was performed on a particular HS-SICH,
the Node B shall include the _HS-SICH ID_ IE that indicates which HS-SICH was
measured.]
In the case where the _Node B Communication Context ID_ IE is set to \"All
NBCC\", the _CRNC Communication Context ID_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT
INITIATION RESPONSE shall be set to the value \"All CRNCCC\", which is
reserved for this purpose.
[FDD - If the _Alternative Format Reporting Indicator_ IE is set to
\"Alternative format is allowed\" in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION
REQUEST message, the Node B may include the _Extended Round Trip Time_ IE in
the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.]
**Interaction with Reset Procedure:**
If a measurement has been requested with the _Node B Communication Context ID_
IE set to \"All NBCC\", the Node B shall terminate the measurement locally if
either the CRNC or the Node B initiates the Reset procedure for the relevant
Communication Control Port or the entire Node B.
#### 8.3.8.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 39: Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure: Unsuccessful Operation
If the requested measurement cannot be initiated, the Node B shall send a
DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE message using the Communication
Control Port assigned to the Node B Communication Context. The message shall
include the same Measurement ID that was used in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT
INITIATION REQUEST message and the _Cause_ IE set to an appropriate value.
In the case where the _Node B Communication Context ID_ IE is set to \"All
NBCC\" the _CRNC Communication Context ID_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT
INITIATION FAILURE shall be set to the value \"All CRNCCC\", which is reserved
for this purpose.
Typical cause values are as follows:
**Radio Network Layer cause**
\- Measurement not supported for the object

sent, with the _Cause_ IE set to \"Not enough user plane processing
resources\".]
In the other cases, the Radio Link Failure procedure is used to indicate that
one or more Radio Link(s)/Radio Link Set(s) are permanently unavailable and
cannot be restored. After sending the RADIO LINK FAILURE INDICATION message to
notify the permanent failure, the Node B shall not remove the Radio Link/Radio
Link Set from the Node B Communication Context or the Node B Communication
Context itself. When applicable, the retention priorities associated with the
transport channels shall be used by the Node B to prioritise which Radio
Link(s)/Radio Link Set(s) to indicate as unavailable to the CRNC.

The Compressed Mode Command procedure shall not be initiated if a Prepared
Reconfiguration exists, as defined in subclause 3.1.
#### 8.3.14.2 Successful Operation
Figure 47: Compressed Mode Command procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated by the CRNC sending a COMPRESSED MODE COMMAND
message to the Node B using the Communication Control Port assigned to the
concerned Node B Communication Context.
The Node B shall deactivate all the ongoing Transmission Gap Pattern Sequences
at the _CM Configuration Change CFN_ IE requested by the CRNC when receiving
the COMPRESSED MODE COMMAND message from the CRNC. From that moment on, all
Transmission Gap Pattern Sequences included in _Transmission Gap Pattern
Sequence Status_ IE repetitions (if present) shall be started when the
indicated _TGCFN_ IE elapses. The _CM Configuration Change CFN_ IE in the
_Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE and _TGCFN_ IE for each sequence
refer to the next coming CFN with that value.
If the values of the _CM Configuration Change CFN_ IE and the _TGCFN_ IE are
equal, the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be started
immediately at the CFN with a value equal to the value received in the _CM
Configuration Change CFN_ IE.
If the _Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List_ IE is included, the concerned
Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to HS-DSCH serving cells
associated with _C-ID_ IE included in _Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List_ IE.
Otherwise the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to
all the configured serving cells.

### 8.3.15 Downlink Power Timeslot Control [TDD]
#### 8.3.15.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the Node B to use the indicated DL
Timeslot ISCP values when deciding the DL TX Power for each timeslot.
The Downlink Power Timeslot Control procedure can be initiated by the CRNC at
any time when the Node B Communication Context exists, irrespective of other
ongoing CRNC initiated dedicated NBAP procedures towards this Node B
Communication Context. The only exception occurs when the CRNC has requested
the deletion of the last RL via this Node B, in which case the Downlink Power
Timeslot Control procedure shall no longer be initiated.
#### 8.3.15.2 Successful Operation
Figure 47A: Downlink Power Timeslot Control procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated by the CRNC sending a DL POWER TIMESLOT CONTROL
REQUEST message to the Node B using the Communication Control Port assigned to
the concerned Node B Communication Context.
Upon reception, the Node B shall use the indicated DL Timeslot ISCP value when
deciding the DL TX Power for each timeslot as specified in ref. TS 25.224
[21], i.e. it shall reduce the DL TX power in those downlink timeslots of the
radio link where the interference is low, and increase the DL TX power in
those timeslots where the interference is high, while keeping the total
downlink power in the radio link unchanged.
If the _Primary CCPCH RSCP Delta_ IE is included, the Node B shall assume that
the reported value for Primary CCPCH RSCP is in the negative range as per TS
25.123 [23], and the value is equal to the _Primary CCPCH RSCP Delta_ IE. If
the _Primary CCPCH RSCP Delta_ IE is not included and the _Primary CCPCH RSCP_
IE is included, the Node B shall assume that the reported value is in the non-
negative range as per TS 25.123 [23], and the value is equal to the _Primary
CCPCH RSCP_ IE. The Node B should use the indicated value for HS-DSCH
scheduling and transmit power adjustment.

## 9.2 Information Element Functional Definition and Contents
### 9.2.0 General
Subclause 9.2 presents the NBAP IE definitions in tabular format. The
corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in Subclause 9.3. In case there is
a contradiction between the tabular format in Subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1
definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of
conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format
shall take precedence.
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by
bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description
of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards
to the ordering of bits:
\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
\- When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the
bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

#### 9.2.1.9A Common Channels Capacity Consumption Law
The capacity consumption law indicates to the CRNC how the Capacity Credit is
consumed by NBAP set of procedures, depending on the allocated Spreading
Factor. [FDD - For the PRACH, the reference spreading factor shall be the
minimum possible spreading factor amongst the ones defined by the _RACH Slot
Format_ IE(s) in the Common Transport Channel Setup or Reconfiguration
procedures.]
This capacity consumption law indicates the consumption law to be used with
the following procedures:
\- Common Transport Channel Setup
\- Common Transport Channel Deletion
\- [FDD - Common Transport Channel Reconfiguration]
For the Common Transport Channel Setup procedure, the cost given in the
consumption law shall be debited from the Capacity Credit, whereas it shall be
credited to the Capacity Credit for the Common Transport Channel Deletion one.
[FDD - For the Common Transport Channel Reconfiguration procedure, the
difference of the consumption cost for the new spreading factor and the
consumption cost for the old spreading factor shall be debited from the
Capacity Credit (or credited if this difference is negative).]
If the modelling of the internal resource capability of the Node B is modelled
independently for the Uplink and Downlink, the \"DL cost\" shall be applied to
the \"DL or Global Capacity Credit\" and the \"UL Cost\" shall be applied to
the \"UL Capacity Credit\". If it is modelled as shared resources, both the
\"DL cost\" and the \"UL cost\" shall be applied to the \"DL or Global
Capacity Credit\".
[FDD - When the Common Transport Channel Setup, Deletion or Reconfiguration
procedures are used, the Capacity Credit shall be updated considering all
physical channels related in these procedures (S-CCPCH, PICH, PRACH and AICH),
i.e. one cost shall be credited to or debited from the Capacity Credit per
physical channel.]
[FDD - The costs given in the consumption law are the costs per channelization
code. When multiple channelization codes are used by a physical channel, the
cost credited to or debited from the Capacity Credit for this physical channel
shall be taken as N times the cost given in the consumption law, where N is
the number of channelization codes.]
[TDD - When the Common Transport Channel Setup or Deletion procedures are
used, the Capacity Credit shall be updated considering all physical channels
related in these procedures (S-CCPCH, PICH, PRACH), i.e. one cost shall be
credited to or debited from the Capacity Credit per physical channel.]

#### 9.2.1.20A Dedicated Channels Capacity Consumption Law
The capacity consumption law indicates to the CRNC how the Capacity Credit is
consumed by NBAP set of procedures, depending on the [FDD - allocated
Spreading Factor and the RL/RLS situation] [TDD - allocated Spreading Factor
on each DPCH and the assigned timeslot]. [FDD - In Uplink, the reference
spreading factor shall be the minimum spreading factor signalled in the Radio
Link Setup Request message. This is signalled using the _Min UL Channelisation
Code Length_ IE.]
This capacity consumption law indicates the consumption law to be used with
the following procedures :
\- Radio Link Setup
\- Radio Link Addition
\- Radio Link Reconfiguration
\- Radio Link Deletion
\- [TDD - Physical Shared Channel Reconfiguration]
For the Radio Link Setup and Radio Link Addition procedures, the cost given in
the consumption law shall be debited from the Capacity Credit, whereas it
shall credited to the Capacity Credit for the Radio Link Deletion procedure.
For the Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure, the difference of the
consumption cost for the new spreading factor and the consumption cost for the
old spreading factor shall be debited from the Capacity Credit (or credited
when this difference is negative).
If the modelling of the internal resource capability of the Node B is modelled
independently for the Uplink and Downlink, the DL cost shall be applied to the
DL or Global Capacity Credit and the UL Cost shall be applied to the UL
Capacity Credit. If it is modelled as shared resources, both the DL costs and
the UL costs shall be applied to the DL or Global Capacity Credit.
[FDD - For a Radio Link creating a Radio Link Set (first RL of a RLS), the
cost for the RL (cost 2) and RLS (cost 1) shall be taken into account. When
adding a Radio Link to a Radio Link Set, only the RL cost (cost 2) shall be
taken into account.\ In the case where multiple Radio Links are established in
one procedure, for every created Radio Link Set, the first Radio Link is
always the Radio Link with the lowest repetition number.]
[FDD - The costs given in the consumption law are the costs per channelization
code. When multiple channelization codes are used by either the radio links,
the cost credited to or debited from the Capacity Credit shall be taken as N
times the cost for one code, where N is the number of channelization codes.]
[TDD - The cost for a radio link is a sum of the costs for each DPCH. For the
first DPCH assigned to any user in a cell within a timeslot, the initial cost
for a DPCH in a timeslot (cost 1) and the cost for a DPCH (cost 2) shall be
taken into account. For any DPCH that is not the first DPCH assigned for any
user in a cell within a timeslot, only the cost for a DPCH (cost 2) shall be
taken into account.]
[TDD - The cost for shared channels is the sum of the costs for each PDSCH and
PUSCH assigned to a PUSCH or PDSCH set. For the first PDSCH or PUSCH assigned
to any user in a cell within a timeslot, the initial cost for a PDSCH/PUSCH in
a timeslot (cost 1) and the cost for a PDSCH/PUSCH (cost 2) shall be taken
into account. For any PDSCH/PUSCH that is not the first PDSCH/PUSCH assigned
to any user in a cell within a timeslot, only the cost for a PDSCH/PUSCH (cost
2) shall be taken into account.]
[TDD - In the case of Physical Shared Channel Reconfiguration, the sum of the
consumption cost of the each PDSCH/PUSCH of the previous configuration shall
be credited to the capacity credit, and the sum of the consumption cost of

#### 9.2.1.21 DL Power
The _DL Power_ IE indicates a power level relative to the [FDD - primary CPICH
power] [TDD - primary CCPCH power] configured in a cell. If Transmit Diversity
is applied to a downlink physical channel, the _DL Power_ IE indicates the
power offset between the linear sum of the power for this downlink physical
channel on all branches and the [FDD - primary CPICH power] [TDD - PCCPCH
power] configured in a cell.
[FDD - If referred to a DPCH, it indicates the power of the transmitted DPDCH
symbols.] [FDD - If referred to an F‑DPCH, it indicates the Reference F-DPCH
TX Power.]
[TDD - If referred to a DPCH or PDSCH, it indicates the power of a spreading
factor 16 code, the power for a spreading factor 1 code would be 12 dB higher.
If referred to a SCCPCH, the _DL Power_ IE specifies the maximum power of the
SCCPCH.]

#### 9.2.2.13Ja E-DCH Capacity Consumption Law
The capacity consumption law indicates to the CRNC how the Capacity Credit is
consumed by NBAP set of procedures, depending on the RL/RLS situation and the
number of uplink E-DPDCHs and their spreading factors. The reference spreading
factor and number of E-DPDCH is signalled using the _Maximum Set of E-DPDCHs_
IE.
This capacity consumption law indicates the consumption law to be used with
the following procedures :
\- Radio Link Setup
\- Radio Link Addition
\- Radio Link Reconfiguration
\- Radio Link Deletion
For the Radio Link Setup and Radio Link Addition procedures, the cost given in
the consumption law shall be debited from the Capacity Credit, whereas it
shall credited to the Capacity Credit for the Radio Link Deletion procedure.
For the Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure, the difference of the
consumption cost for the new spreading factor and the consumption cost for the
old spreading factor shall be debited from the Capacity Credit (or credited
when this difference is negative).
If the modelling of the internal resource capability of the Node B is modelled
independently for the Uplink and Downlink, the DL cost shall be applied to the
DL or Global Capacity Credit and the UL Cost shall be applied to the UL
Capacity Credit. If it is modelled as shared resources, both the DL costs and
the UL costs shall be applied to the DL or Global Capacity Credit.
For a Radio Link creating a Radio Link Set (first RL of a RLS), the cost for
the RL (cost 2) and RLS (cost 1) shall be taken into account. When adding a
Radio Link to a Radio Link Set, only the RL cost (cost 2) shall be taken into
account.\ In the case where multiple Radio Links are established in one
procedure, for every created Radio Link Set, the first Radio Link is always
the Radio Link with the lowest repetition number.
The costs given in the consumption law are the costs per channelization
code/no of E-DPDCH.

#### 9.2.2.129 Cell Capability Container
The _Cell Capability Container_ IE indicates the cell capability by setting
the corresponding bit in the BIT String.
The cell capability of multi-cell related functions may depend on that the
cell is multi-cell capable (adjacent carrier and/or non-adjacent carrier)
and/or Dual Band capable. Such capability indicators in this _Cell Capability
Container_ IE shall be ignored by the CRNC if the local cell does not have the
required cell capability: \"Multi Cell Capable\" as indicated with _Multi Cell
Capability Info_ IE and/or \"Dual Band Capable\" as indicated with _Dual Band
Capability Info_ IE. Capability indicators that depend on multi-cell (adjacent
carrier) capability are indicated in the table below with /Adjacent-carrier/.
Capability indicators that depend on multi-cell (non-adjacent carrier )
capability are indicated in the table below with /Adjacent-carrier/ if the
capability bit "Non-contiguous HSDPA operation Capability" is set. Capability
indicators that depend on Dual Band capability are indicated in the table
below with /Dual-band/. Capability indicators that depend on that the local
cell has one or both of the capabilities multi-cell (adjacent carrier) and
Dual Band are indicated in the table below with /Multi-cell/. Capability
indicators that depend on that the local cell has one or both of the
capabilities multi-cell (non-adjacent carrier) and Dual Band are indicated in
the table below with /Multi-cell/ if the capability bit "Non-contiguous HSDPA
operation Capability" is set. Cell Capability for the marked capabilities
indicate capability regardless of the supported multi-cell type in a multicell
configuration for the local cell: supported multi-cell type is - both serving
HS-DSCH and secondary serving HS-DSCH, - secondary serving HS-DSCH or -
serving HS-DSCH.

#### 9.2.2.130 Multicell E-DCH Transport Bearer Mode
This parameter indicates the Multicell E-DCH Transport Bearer Mode. For
_Multicell E-DCH Transport Bearer Mode_ = \"Separate Iub Transport Bearer
Mode\" the Mac-d flows from each carrier uses different Iub transport bearers,
for _Multicell E-DCH Transport Bearer Mode_ = \"UL Flow Multiplexing Mode\"
the Mac-d flows received on the different carriers in the Node B is
multiplexed on one Iub transport bearer (per Mac-d flow). The CRNC should
apply the stored cell capabilities for the cell on primary UL frequency for
the capabilities related to Multicell E-DCH Transport Bearer Mode.

## 9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
### 9.3.0 General
NBAP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.680 [12] and ITU-T Rec. X.681
[13].
Subclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of NBAP protocol with ASN.1. In
case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this subclause and
the tabular format in subclauses 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence,
except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional
elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of NBAP messages.
NBAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for
that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by
ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall
construct a NBAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the
following additional rules (Note that in the following IE means an IE in the
object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed to appear more than once in
one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there
is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements
reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears
as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may
contain only one kind of list elements.
If a NBAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
### 9.3.1 Usage of Private Message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used.
\- For special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to
be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a
complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multi-vendor
inter-operability.
\- By vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such
functionality shall be standardised.

## 9.4 Message Transfer Syntax
NBAP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned
Variant as transfer syntax as specified in ref. ITU T Rec. X.691 [11].
## 9.5 Timers
T~Preempt~
\- Specifies the maximum time that a Node B may wait for pre-emption of
resources for establishment or reconfiguration of Radio Links.
# 10 Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
## 10.1 General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
\- Transfer Syntax Error
\- Abstract Syntax Error
\- Logical Error
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node:
Figure 38: Protocol Errors in NBAP.
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in
the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be
included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be
included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is
done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in
subclause 4.1.
## 10.2 Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the
received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the
process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver
should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for
the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:
\- Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. e.g.: If an IE
has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and 12 will be
received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax error.
\- Violation in list element constraints. e.g.: If a list is defined as
containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, than this case
will be handled as a transfer syntax error.
\- Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).
\- Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).
## 10.3 Abstract Syntax Error
### 10.3.1 General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional NBAP entity:
1\. receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown id);
2\. receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g.: ASN.1
definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10 (values 11 to 15 are
undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract
syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the
message);
3\. does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence
of the concerned object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the
received message;
4\. receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in
wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5\. receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the
concerned object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not
have been present in the received message.
Cases 1 and 2 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received
Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on
Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group
specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4
(IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5
(erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the
procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining
message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error that belong to
cases 1-3 act according to the Criticality Information and Presence
Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in
accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is
specified in subclause 10.3.6.
### 10.3.2 Criticality Information
In the NBAP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs
and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to
act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended, i.e. the
entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended
shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as
specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE
group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the
Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality
Information for an IE/IE group are:
\- Reject IE
\- Ignore IE and Notify Sender
Ignore IE
The following rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE, an IE
group or an EP not comprehended (not implemented), and when action based on
criticality information is applicable:
1\. IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for
one EP from a standard version, then other new or modified IEs or IE groups
specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered
comprehended by the receiving entity (some may still remain unsupported).
2\. EP: The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or
between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not
supported may be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that
standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be
applied.
### 10.3.3 Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer
syntax, NBAP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is
optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence
field of the concerned object of class NBAP-PROTOCOL-IES, NBAP-PROTOCOL-IES-
PAIR, NBAP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or NBAP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
  * Optional;
  * Conditional;
  * Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of
the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition
is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an
abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of the
IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to the version
of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due
to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE group.
### 10.3.4 Not comprehended IE/IE group
#### 10.3.4.1 Procedure ID
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of the _Procedure ID_ according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure ID_ marked with \"_Reject IE_ \"
which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall reject
the procedure using the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure ID_ marked with \"_Ignore IE and
Notify Sender_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving
node shall ignore the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure ID_ marked with \"_Ignore IE_ \"
which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore
the procedure.
When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to report
an ignored procedure it shall include the _Procedure ID_ IE, the _Triggering
Message_ IE, and the _Procedure Criticality_ IE in the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE.
#### 10.3.4.1A Type of Message
When the receiving node cannot decode the _Type of Message_ IE, the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
#### 10.3.4.2 IEs Other Than the Procedure ID and Type of Message
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of an IE/IE group other than the _Procedure ID_ IE and _Type of
Message_ IE according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" which the receiving node does not
comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed.
The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the rejection of one
or more IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful
outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating
message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to
be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" that the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and
initiate local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the
receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the
content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as
if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the
reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups and report in the response
message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored. In
case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to
determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response
message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate
the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the receiving node
does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups, and initiate the Error Indication procedure to
report that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the receiving node does
not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
  * If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Ignore IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
  * If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Ignore IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" or
\"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using a response message defined for the
procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group. In
the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the _Repetition Number_
IE shall be included and in addition, if the not comprehended IE/IE group is
not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the _Message
Structure_ IE shall be included.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" or
\"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using the Error Indication procedure, the
_Procedure ID_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_ IE,
the _Transaction ID_ IE, and the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_
IE shall be included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported
IE/IE group. In the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the
_Repetition Number_ IE shall be included and in addition, if the not
comprehended IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see
annex C) also the _Message Structure_ IE shall be included.
### 10.3.5 Missing IE or IE Group
The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the
criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received message
specified in the version of this specification used by the receiver:
**Reject IE:**
  1. If a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Reject IE_ \"; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a received message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message
to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"_Reject IE_ \", the receiving node shall terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"_Reject IE\"_ , the receiving node shall consider the
procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \",
the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with
the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and
report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups
were missing. In case the information received in the initiating message was
insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present
in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a received message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message
to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \", the receiving
node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure
based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
\- If a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \", the receiving node
shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based
on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
**Ignore IE:**
  1. If a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Ignore IE_ \", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
  2. If a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Ignore IE_ \", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Reject IE_
\" or \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using a response message defined for
the procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group. In
the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the _Repetition Number_
IE shall be included and in addition, if the missing IE/IE group is not at
message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the _Message
Structure_ IE shall be included.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Reject IE_
\" or \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using the Error Indication procedure,
the _Procedure ID_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_
IE, the _Transaction ID_ IE, and the _Information Element Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE shall be included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each
reported IE/IE group. In the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE
the _Repetition Number_ IE shall be included and in addition, if the missing
IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also
the _Message Structure_ IE shall be included.
### 10.3.6 IEs or IE Groups Received in Wrong Order or With Too Many
Occurrences or Erroneously Present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences
is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present
when the condition is not met (i.e. erroneously present), the receiving node
shall behave according to the following:
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing IEs or IE
groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present,
none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The
receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value
\"Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)\" using the message
normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the
information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a
value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to
report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall
instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
> 4\. If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
> report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong
> order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving
> node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
> procedure, and use cause value \"Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed
> Message)\".
\- If a _response_ message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong
order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node
shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local
error handling.
> When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the
> specification version used by the receiver shall be considered.
## 10.4 Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but
the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e. semantic
error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the
receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed
(unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary
procedure, irrespective of the criticality of the IEs/IE groups containing the
erroneous values.
**[Class 1:]{.underline}**
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure,
and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this
message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value.
Typical cause values are:
\- Protocol Causes:
1\. Semantic Error
2\. Message not compatible with receiver state
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1
procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this
unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the ERROR
INDICATION procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The
_Procedure ID_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE and the _Transaction ID_ IE
within the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall then be included in order to
identify the message containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure,
the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error
handling shall be initiated.
**[Class 2:]{.underline}**
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the
procedure shall be terminated and the ERROR INDICATION procedure shall be
initiated with an appropriate cause value. The _Procedure ID_ IE, the
_Triggering Message_ IE and the _Transaction ID_ IE within the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE shall then be included in order to identify the message
containing the logical error.
## 10.5 Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence
over any other error handling described in the other subclause of clause 10.
\- If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or
Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not
trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error
handling.
\- In case a response message or ERROR INDICATION message needs to be
returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that
message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully
terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
\- If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value
shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if
one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality "ignore and notify" have
earlier occurred within the same procedure.

_Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE set to \"no priority\" shall be excluded
when setting the allocation priority and pre-emption capability of a Radio
Link.
\- The allocation priority for a Radio Link shall be set to highest priority
level, given by the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_
IE, for all non excluded transport channels that are intended to use the Radio
Link.
\- If all non-excluded transport channels that are intended to use a Radio
Link to be established have the pre-emption capability, given by the _Pre-
emption Capability_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, set to
\"shall not trigger pre-emption\", the pre-emption capability of the Radio
Link shall be set to \"shall not trigger pre-emption\".\ If one or more non-
excluded transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link to be
established have the value of the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE in the

during this allocation/retention process.
## A.1.2 Modification of an Existing Radio Link
The Allocation Information for a Radio Link in the case of modification of a
Radio Link (addition or modification of transport channels using the Radio
Link) shall be derived as follows:
\- The latest received _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for each transport
channel shall be used.
NOTE: The _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for a transport channel may have
been received in\ a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for
the Node B Communication Context in the Node B,\ b) a previous procedure
adding or modifying the transport channel, or\ c) the current procedure adding
or modifying the transport channel.
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
all transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link is set to
\"no priority\", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified
shall be set to \"shall not trigger pre-emption\".
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
one or more of the transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio
Link is not set to \"no priority\", the allocation priority of and the pre-
emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set according to
the following:
\- The transport channels to be added or modified that have the _Priority
Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE set to \"no priority\"
shall be excluded when setting the allocation priority and pre-emption
capability of a Radio Link to be modified.

highest priority level, given by the _Priority Level_ IE in the
_Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, for all the non-excluded transport
channels that are to be added or modified.
\- If all non-excluded transport channels that are to be added or modified in
the Radio Link have the pre-emption capability, given by the _Pre-emption
Capability_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, set to \"shall not
trigger pre-emption\", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be
modified shall be set to \"shall not trigger pre-emption\".\ If one or more of
the non-excluded transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link
have the value of the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention
Priority_ IE set to \"may trigger pre-emption\", the pre-emption capability of
the Radio Link to be modified shall be set to \"may trigger pre-emption\".
The derived allocation priority and pre-emption capability are only valid
during this allocation/retention process.
# A.2 Deriving Retention Information for a Radio Link
The Retention Information for an existing Radio Link shall be derived as
follows:
\- The latest received _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for each transport
channel shall be used.
NOTE: The _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for a transport channel may have
been received in\ a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for
the Node B Communication Context in the Node B or\ b) a procedure adding or
modifying the transport channel.
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
one or more transport channels using the Radio Link is set to \"no priority\",
the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to \"not pre-
emptable\".
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
all the transport channels using the Radio Link is not set to \"no priority\",
the retention priority of the Radio Link and the pre-emption vulnerability of
the Radio Link shall be set according to the following:
\- The retention priority for a Radio Link shall be set to highest priority
level, given by the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_
IE, for all transport channels that uses the Radio Link.
\- If all transport channels that uses the Radio Link have the pre-emption
vulnerability, given by the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE in the
_Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, set to \"pre-emptable\", the pre-emption
vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to \"pre-emptable\".\ If one or
more transport channels that uses the Radio Link have the value of the _Pre-
emption Vulnerability_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE set to
\"not pre-emptable\", the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be
set to \"not pre-emptable\".
The derived retention priority and pre-emption vulnerability are valid until
they are changed, or until the Radio Link is deleted. When new transport
channels are added to or deleted from the Radio Link or when existing
transport channels are modified with regards to the _Allocation/Retention
Priority_ IE, the retention information shall be derived again according to
above.
# A.3 The Allocation/Retention Process
The Node B shall establish or modify the resources for a Radio Link according
to:
  * The value of the Allocation Information (allocation priority and pre-emption capability) of the Radio Link to be established or modified. The Allocation Information is derived according to clause A.1.
  * The value of the Retention Information (retention priority and pre-emption vulnerability) of existing Radio Links. The Retention Information derived according to clause A.2.
  * The resource situation in the cell.
Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption functionality is operator
dependent, the pre-emption indicators (pre-emption capability and pre-emption
vulnerability) shall be treated as follows:
> -. If the pre-emption capability for a Radio Link to be established or
> modified is set to \"may trigger pre-emption\" and the resource situation so
> requires, the Node B may trigger the pre-emption process in clause A.4 to
> free resources for this allocation request.
>
> -. If the pre-emption capability for a Radio Link to be established or
> modified is set to \"shall not trigger pre-emption\", then this allocation
> request shall not trigger the pre-emption process in clause A.4.
>
> -. If the pre-emption vulnerability for an existing Radio Link is set to
> \"pre-emptable\", then this Radio Link shall be included in the pre-emption
> process in clause A.4.
>
> -. If the pre-emption vulnerability for an existing Radio Link is set to
> \"not pre-emptable\", then this Radio Link shall not be included in the pre-
> emption process in clause A.4.
# A.4 The Pre-emption Process
The pre-emption process shall only pre-empt Radio Links with lower retention
priority than the allocation priority of the Radio Link to be established or
modified. The Radio Links to be pre-empted shall be selected in ascending
order of the retention priority.
When the pre-emption process detects that one or more Radio Links have to be
pre-empted to free resources for a Radio Link(s) to be established or
modified, the Node B shall initiate the Radio Link Pre-emption procedure for
all the Node B Communication Contexts having Radio Links selected for pre-
emption and start the T~Preempt~ timer.
When enough resources are freed to establish or modify the Radio Link(s)
according to the request, the Node B shall stop the T~Preempt~ timer and
complete the procedure that triggered the pre-emption process in accordance
with the \"Successful Operation\" subclause of the procedure.
If the T~Preempt~ timer expires, the Node B shall regard the procedure that
triggered the pre-emption process as failed and complete the procedure in
accordance with the \"Unsuccessful Operation\" subclause of the procedure.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Measurement Reporting
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event A\" (figure B.1), the
Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated when the measured entity rises
above the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis
time. If no hysteresis time is given, the value zero shall be used for the
hysteresis time.
Figure B.1: Event A reporting with Hysteresis Time specified
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event B\" (figure B.2), the
Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated when the measured entity falls
below the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis
time. If no hysteresis time is given, the value zero shall be used for the
hysteresis time.
Figure B.2: Event B reporting with Hysteresis Time specified
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event C\" (figure B.3), the
Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated always when the measured entity
rises by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested
time. The reporting in figure B.3 is initiated if the Rising Time T1 is less
than the requested time.
Figure B.3: Event C reporting
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event D\" (figure B.4), the
Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated always when the measured entity
falls by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested
time. The reporting in figure B.4 is initiated if the Falling Time T1 is less
than the requested time.
Figure B.4: Event D reporting
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event E\" (figure B.5), the
Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated always when the
measured entity rises above the 'Measurement Threshold 1' and stays there for
the 'Measurement Hysteresis Time' (T1 in figure B.5). If _Report Periodicity_
IE is provided Node B shall also initiate Measurement Reporting procedure
periodically. The periodic reporting continues although the measured entity
falls below the 'Measurement Threshold 1' and is terminated by the Report B.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measured entity falls below
the 'Measurement Threshold 2' and stays there for the 'Measurement Hysteresis
Time' (T1) Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) is initiated and the
periodic reporting is terminated.
Figure B.5: Event E reporting with Hysteresis Time specified and Periodic
Reporting requested
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to \"Event F\" (figure B.6), the
Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated always when the
measured entity falls below the 'Measurement Threshold 1' and stays there for
the 'Measurement Hysteresis Time' (T1 in figure B.6). If _Report Periodicity_
IE is provided Node B shall also initiate Measurement Reporting procedure
periodically. The periodic reporting continues although the measured entity
rises above the 'Measurement Threshold 1' and is terminated by the Report B.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measured entity rises above
the 'Measurement Threshold 2' and stays there for the 'Measurement Hysteresis
Time' (T1) Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) is initiated and the
periodic reporting is terminated.

###### ## Annex D (normative): IB_SG_DATA Encoding
# **D.** 1 Overall Description
There exist two variants for encoding _IB_SG_DATA_ IE (see section 9.2.1.32),
which are detailed in subsections below. To avoid incorrect transmission of
System Information on Uu, the following behaviour is required:
\- For each Iub, CRNC shall use the encoding variant supported by the Node B
for the _IB_SG_DATA_ IE (see section 9.2.1.32) when sending the SYSTEM
INFORMATION UPDATE REQUEST message to the Node B. This is supported by
configuration in the CRNC.
# **D**.2 IB_SG_DATA Encoding Variant 1
This variant corresponds to the algorithm, that ASN.1 length encoding for the
conveyed SIB segment is performed by the RNC. Building of IB_SG_DATA segments
involves two steps:
1) Segmentation of MIB/SIB/SB and
2) RRC encoding of the segments, which includes the PER encoding of the length
in case of \"SIB data variable\".

Figure D.1: The Building of Segments
# D.3 IB_SG_DATA Encoding Variant 2
This variant corresponds to the algorithm, that ASN.1 length encoding for the
conveyed segment is not performed by the RNC. Segments are built in the CRNC
by segmentation of a MIB/SIB/SB.

###### ## Annex E (informative): Reporting the status of resources used for
frequency (1.28 Mcps TDD only)
For a multi-frequency cell, the Local Cell represents the resources in the
Node B that can be used for the configuration of a number of frequencies in
the cell. The resources for a frequency in Node B are defined as FPM
(Frequency Process Module) and is identified by FPM ID.
In the Cell Setup procedure, RNC should configure FPM for each frequency by
including _FPM ID_ IE in the CELL SETUP REQUEST message.
In the Cell Reconfiguration procedure, RNC should configure FPM for each added
frequency by including _FPM ID_ IE in the CELL RECONFIGURATION REQUEST
message.
In Audit procedure, the Node B should include the _FPM_ ID IE and the _Local
Cell ID_ IE in the _Local Cell Information_ IE to report the status of a FPM
in the AUDIT RESPONSE message.
In Resource Status Indication procedure, the Node B should include the _FPM
ID_ IE and the _Local Cell ID_ IE in the _Local Cell Information_ IE to report
the status of a FPM in the RESOURCE STATUS INDICATION message.
