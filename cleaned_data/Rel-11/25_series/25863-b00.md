# 1 Scope
The present document is intended to capture RAN1 and RAN4 findings produced in
the context of the study item \"Uplink Transmit Diversity for HSPA\" [2]. The
study is focussed on schemes that do not require any newly standardised
dynamic feedback signalling between network and UE. The uplink transmit
diversity schemes maybe categorized into two types of algorithms:
\- transmission from 1 Tx antenna (e.g. switched antenna Tx diversity); or
\- simultaneous transmission from 2 Tx antennas (e.g. transmit beamforming).
The scope is understood to be limited to schemes which also do not require any
semi-static mode configuration signalling for demodulation. The possibility of
semi-static disabling of a transmit diversity scheme is not precluded.
The work under this study item aims at:
\- evaluating the potential benefits of the indicated UL Tx diversity
techniques;
\- investigating the impacts on the UE implementation;
\- investigating how to ensure that the UE operating an uplink Tx diversity
will not cause any detrimental effects to overall system performance;
\- investigating the impacts of Tx diversity on existing BS and UE RF and
demodulation performance requirements; and
\- analyzing how to derive any additional performance/test requirements that
are deemed needed as an outcome of the study, as well as understanding the
impacts of any such new requirements.
The performance of closed loop transmit diversity, in which the Node-B
controls and dynamically adapts the pre-coding vector that a UE shall apply is
described in [124].

# 4 Description of Uplink Transmit Diversity Algorithms
## 4.1 Theoretical Analysis of Uplink Transmit Diversity
A theoretical gain analysis of both genie open loop switched antenna and
beamforming algorithms in the single path independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channel (no antenna imbalance) under some
ideal assumptions is presented below. The gains computed here serve as a
reference for the design of practical transmit diversity schemes.
### 4.1.1 No Transmit Diversity
For the baseline system of one transmit antenna and dual receive antennas,
under the assumption of perfect inner loop power control to achieve combined
receive power target P (the ideal assumptions include: no delay, no feedback
error, and no quantization), the channel is instantaneously inverted by the
power control. The average required transmit power is:
{width="2.2333333333333334in" height="0.48333333333333334in"}
where:
\- {width="0.16666666666666666in" height="0.18333333333333332in"} indicates
the channel between receive antenna {width="5.0e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} and transmit antenna {width="5.0e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}.
\- {width="0.275in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} represents the expectation
of random variable {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}.
\- The channels {width="0.16666666666666666in" height="0.18333333333333332in"}
have an i.i.d. distribution of complex Gaussian with zero mean and variance
0.5 per complex dimension.
\- The distribution of the random variable {width="0.85in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}, that was used in evaluating the above
integral can be found on page 62 of [3].
### 4.1.2 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
Assume that ideal channel state information is available at the UE. Then the
instantaneously best transmit antenna which has the larger channel gain will
be chosen for the transmission. Furthermore, with the assumption of perfect
inner loop power control (to achieve combined receive power target P), the
instantaneous transmit power is:
$\frac{P}{\text{max}_{j = 1,2}\left{ \left| h_{1,j} \right|^{2} + \left|
h_{2,j} \right|^{2} \right}}$
The average transmit power needed for switched antenna scheme is:
$E\left\lbrack \frac{P}{\text{max}_{j = 1,2}\left{ \left| h_{1,j} \right|^{2}
+ \left| h_{2,j} \right|^{2} \right}} \right\rbrack =
\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{P}{x}f(x)\text{dx} = \frac{P}{2}$
In order to evaluate the above expectation, the probability distribution of
the denominator within the expectation can be derived as follows:
Define two random variables $X_{j} = \left| h_{1,j} \right|^{2} + \left|
h_{2,j} \right|^{2},j = 1,2$ . They are independent and identically
distributed with probability distribution function $\text{xe}^{- x}$. The
probability distribution function of the random variable
$\text{max}(X_{1},X_{2})$ can be further derived based on the well known
formula for maximum of two independent random variables in [3], which yields:
$f\left( x \right) = 2\text{xe}^{- x}\left\lbrack 1 - (1 + x)e^{- x}
\right\rbrack$
Finally, the expectation is evaluated as follows:
$E\left\lbrack \frac{P}{\text{max}_{j = 1,2}\left{ \left| h_{1,j} \right|^{2}
+ \left| h_{2,j} \right|^{2} \right}} \right\rbrack =
\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{P}{x}2\text{xe}^{- x}\left\lbrack 1 - (1 + x)e^{- x}
\right\rbrack\text{dx} = \frac{P}{2}$
Thus relative to the baseline, there is ideally a 3 dB gain by using switched
antenna transmit diversity.
### 4.1.3 Beam-forming Transmit Diversity
For the beamforming case, assuming that ideal channel state information is
available at the UE side, the optimal beamforming vector (refer to section
8.2.3 of [4]) is the dominant eigenmode of the channel matrix $H =
\begin{bmatrix} h_{\text{11}} & h_{\text{12}} \ h_{\text{21}} & h_{\text{22}}
\ \end{bmatrix}$. If it is used at the UE transmitter, then the channel gain
is the dominant eigenvalue of the random matrix $\text{HH}^{}$. Under the
assumption of perfect inner loop power control (to achieve combined receive
power target P), the average transmit power needed for beamforming is:
$E\left\lbrack \frac{P}{\lambda_{1}^{2}} \right\rbrack =
\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{P}{x}\left\lbrack e^{- x}\left( x^{2} - 2x + 2 \right)
- 2e^{- 2x} \right\rbrack\text{dx} = 0\text{.}\text{386}P$
Thus relative to the baseline, there is ideally 4.1 dB gain by using
beamforming transmit diversity. The expression of the probability distribution
function of {width="0.13333333333333333in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}can
be found as follows.
The joint distribution of ordered eigenvalues of the Wishart matrix
$\text{HH}^{}$ is [5]:
$\begin{matrix} e^{- (y_{1} + y_{2})}\left( y_{1} - y_{2} \right)^{2}, & y_{1}
\ \end{matrix}y_{2}0$
Taking the marginal distribution of $y_{1}$, we arrive at the distribution of
$\lambda_{1}^{2}$.
## 4.2 Genie Algorithms
_The genie algorithms described here serve the purpose of establishing upper
bounds for the potential system performance gains that can be achieved with
uplink transmit diversity in HSPA._
### 4.2.1 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
Figure 1 shows a high level block diagram of open loop switched antenna
transmit diversity between a UE and a NodeB.
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="3.9in"}
Figure 1: Block Diagram of Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
Let $h_{i,j}(l,k)$ denote the _l^th^_ path of the propagation channel from
transmit antenna j to receive antenna i in time slot k of a radio frame.
We define the reference UE transmitter algorithm for genie open loop switched
antenna transmit diversity as follows:
\- Every radio frame (10ms), the reference UE transmitter makes a decision on
whether to switch the transmit antennas or not.
\- Transmit Antenna j (j = 1,2) is selected if $\frac{1}{\text{15}}\sum_{k =
1}^{\text{15}}{\sum_{l = 1}^{L}\left( \left| h_{1,j}(l,k) \right|^{2} + \left|
h_{2,j}(l,k) \right|^{2} \right)}$ in the previous frame is the maximum for
that antenna. Note that this selection is based on perfect knowledge of the of
the channel information $h_{i,j}(l,k)$ at the UE.
\- Long term and short term antenna imbalances as defined in section 5.3.1 are
modeled sequentially (and thus fully accounted for).
The NodeB receiver is assumed to be unaware that the UE is in open loop
switched antenna transmit diversity mode i.e. no changes are made to the NodeB
receiver processing (synchronization, channel estimation, demodulation,
decoding) to accommodate UEs in open loop switched antenna transmit diversity
mode.
The above combination of UE transmitter and NodeB receiver serves as a genie
switched antenna transmit diversity algorithm against which practical open
loop switched antenna transmit diversity UEs can be compared.

Figure 2: Block Diagram of Beamforming Transmit Diversity
Let $h_{i,j}(l,k)$ denote the _l^th^_ path of the propagation channel from
transmit antenna j to receive antenna i in time slot k of a radio frame.
Define the set of 2x2 channel matrices as:
$H_{l}(k) = \begin{bmatrix} h_{1,1}(l,k) & h_{1,2}(l,k) \ h_{2,1}(l,k) &
h_{2,2}(l,k) \ \end{bmatrix}$
We define the reference UE transmitter algorithm for genie open loop
beamforming transmit diversity as follows:
\- Every slot (0.667 ms) k, the reference UE beamformer applies a weight
vector $\underline{w} = \begin{bmatrix} w_{1} & w_{2} \ \end{bmatrix}^{T}$to
each transmit antenna such that $\sum_{l =
1}^{L}{{\underline{w}}^{H}H_{l}(k)^{H}H_{l}(k)\underline{w}}$is maximized.
\- Both antennas have equal gain and the amplitudes of the input signal to
both the antennas are equal.
\- Long term and short term antenna imbalances as defined in section 5.3.1 are
modeled sequentially.
The NodeB receiver is assumed to be unaware that the UE is in open loop
beamforming transmit diversity mode i.e. no changes are made to the NodeB
receiver processing (synchronization, channel estimation, demodulation,
decoding) to accommodate UEs in this mode.
The above combination of UE transmitter and NodeB receiver serves as a genie
beamforming transmit diversity algorithm against which practical open loop
beamforming transmit diversity UEs can be compared.
## 4.3 Practical Algorithms
### 4.3.1 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
The reference practical algorithm for SATD for use in CELL_DCH is described as
follows (Tx1b in [6]):
1\. Let TPC command DOWN be represented by -1 and TPC command UP by +1. Then
let the UE accumulate all received TPC commands.
2\. At each frame border the accumulated TPC sum is compared with 0. If the
sum is larger than 0 the transmit antenna is switched.
3\. If the same transmit antenna has been used for X consecutive frames the UE
automatically switches antenna. Note that the UE accumulates TPC commands
continuously as long as a switch does not occur.
4\. Every time an antenna switch occurs the accumulated TPC sum is reset to 0.
A suitable setting for X equals 14 radio frames. In the case a UE is in SHO
the combined TPC is considered in the algorithm.
#### 4.3.1.1 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity - Suboptimal Algorithm
Since the SI does not specify one algorithm it is important to also study the
performance of suboptimal algorithms. One example of such a suboptimal
algorithm would be to let the UE make randomized decisions occasionally. These
randomized decisions could, for example, result from incorrect decoding of the
TPC commands. To model the randomness of the UE behaviour a parameter p is
used. Given the parameter p the algorithm works as follows:
Define 0 ≤ p≤ 0.5
randN = rand(1,1);
If randN ≤ p
Use 1st antenna
Else if (p \ number of up commands), the direction is kept otherwise it is
changed.
In the case a UE is in SHO the combined TPC is considered in the algorithm.
Practical BFTD Algorithm 2 [7], [8] in CELL_DCH:
This algorithm periodically adds a phase offset ($\delta$) to the relative
phase of the two transmit signals. The existing uplink power control command
is used as the feedback and is input into the algorithm. The algorithm then
determines the suitable phase is in the region of larger radian (degrees) or
in the region of smaller radian (degrees) and make a phase move by
($\varepsilon$_)_ degrees (or not move at all). The transmit beam is formed
and dynamically steered toward the serving base station that is power
controlling the UE by the relative phase (plus the phase difference by the
path difference and fading).
The algorithm is described in more detail as follows:
1\. The algorithm is based on the combined TPC.
2\. The phase offset, $\delta$_,_ can be 48 degrees, $\varepsilon$can be 12
degrees.
3\. Let TPC command DOWN be represented by -1 and TPC command UP by +1.
a. Initial relative phase between two transmitters $\text{Δϕ} = - \delta/2$for
the first slot (#1 slot). $\varepsilon$is kept zero until two TPC commands
become available to the UE.
b. Apply relative phase for the next slot $\text{Δϕ} = \text{Δϕ} + \delta$.
c. Determine new relative phase:
i. if TPC1>TPC2, $\text{Δϕ} = \text{Δϕ} + \varepsilon$;
ii. if TPC2>TPC1, $\text{Δϕ} = \text{Δϕ} - \varepsilon$;
iii. otherwise, no change.
NOTE: TPC1 and TPC2 correspond to slot (1,2),(3,4), .., (i*2-1, i*2), where
i=1 to n.
d. Apply relative phase for the next slot $\text{Δϕ} = \text{Δϕ} - \delta$.
e. Go to step b.
The above algorithm can be implemented in two ways:
1\. Asymmetric phase implementation:
\- In this implementation, the phase of the transmit signal from the first
antenna is kept constant and the relative phase is applied only to the
transmit signal from the second antenna.
2\. Symmetric phase implementation:
\- In this implementation, half of the relative phase is applied to the
transmit signal from the first antenna and the other half of the relative
phase is applied with an opposite sign to the transmit signal from the second
antenna.

Practical BFTD algorithm [8] for use in CELL_FACH state.
In the case when the BFTD capable UE has at least one full-power PA, the UE
may skip the algorithm below and perform legacy RACH procedures as defined
today.
In the case the BFTD capable UE does not utilize full-power PA (e.g. with 2
half-power PAs), it may not have sufficient power to initiate a call and then
the following beamforming algorithm may be used for the purpose of random
access:
1\. An initial value for the phase difference (between the two transmit
signals) may be any arbitrary initial value (e.g. 0 degrees).
2\. The initial phase is applied to the first preamble.
3\. If acknowledgement from the base station is NOT received before the next
preamble is scheduled to send, the relative phase is increased by a certain
amount (say, 96 degrees) and is applied to the next transmit preamble.
4\. The new relative phase keeps increasing a certain amount per preamble
period until the acknowledgement is received.
5\. This procedure can cross the different call sequences, if necessary.

## 5.2 Link Performance Evaluation Metrics
The following performance measures are used when evaluating the link level
simulations:
\- Received Eb/N0.
\- Transmitted Ec/No.
\- Number of antenna switches per second.
\- Distribution of amplitude and phase changes at the UE transmitter.
\- Distribution of amplitude and phase changes at the Node-B receiver.
The performance measures have previously been summarized in [18] and for the
sake of clarity we highlight that transmitted $E_{c}/N_{0}$ also accounts for
the power associated with the overhead channels i.e.:
$\frac{E_{c}}{N_{0}} = \frac{E_{c,\text{DPCCH}}}{N_{0}}\left( 1 + \frac{E_{c,E
- \text{DPCCH}}}{E_{c,\text{DPCCH}}} + \frac{E_{c,E -
\text{DPDCH}}}{E_{c,\text{DPCCH}}} + \frac{E_{c,\text{HS} -
\text{DPCCH}}}{E_{c,\text{DPCCH}}} \right)$
## 5.3 System Simulation Assumptions
### 5.3.1 Modelling of Antenna Imbalance
The difference in characteristics between the two transmit antennas are
modelled by means of a long-term and short‑term antenna imbalance. The _long-
term antenna imbalanc_ e is attributed to differences in antenna efficiency
and form factor considerations. Thus it is a UE specific variable and the size
of it is determined by antenna design. While this in part can be controlled in
the manufacturing process, RAN1 has not evaluated the feasiblity (e.g.
additional costs) of ensuring that the two antennas are balanced. The _short-
term antenna imbalance_ is attributed to e.g. body effects and antenna
imperfections. Thus this will vary spatially. For simplicity, the short-term
antenna imbalance in the system evaluations is assumed to be:
\- Independent between different links.
\- Constant throughout the simulations (i.e. no temporal effects are taken
into account).
To summarize, each UE is associated with one value describing the long-term
antenna imbalance and a set of values describing the short-term antenna
imbalances. Note that both the long-term and the short-term antenna imbalance
are modelled with an offset that is applied to the second antenna only. This
is illustrated in figure 3.
{width="3.7819444444444446in" height="2.078472222222222in"}
Figure 3: Illustration of how an UE is affected by the long-term antenna
imbalance μLT\ and short-term antenna imbalance XST,i
The long and short term antenna imbalance has been evaluated in [10], [11],
[12], [13], [14], [16], [17] by means of field measurements combined with
simulation experiments.
In the analysis the antenna pattern in the far field is described by its 3
dimensional complex response consisting of the vertical and horizontal
polarization components. The radiation pattern can then be written as:
${\overrightarrow{E}}_{i} = E_{\hat{\theta}}^{i}(\theta,\phi) \cdot
\hat{\theta} + E_{\hat{\varphi}}^{i}(\theta,\phi) \cdot \phi$
where$E_{\theta}^{i}(\theta,\phi)$ is the vertical polarization component,
$E_{\phi}^{i}(\theta,\phi)$is the horizontal polarization component, $i$ is
the antenna index, $\phi$ is the azimuth angle, $\theta$ is the angle of
elevation (inclination), and $\hat{\phi},\ \hat{\theta},\hat{r}$ are the unit
vectors that form the bases. Figure 4 illustrates the bases under which the
antenna pattern measurements were made.

Figure 4: Measurement basis for the capture of the 3-D complex response of the
antenna
When evaluating the antenna imbalance associated with a particular device, the
antenna imbalance was measured for several different angles of departures. For
each specific angle of departure ϕ0 (realizations) the following methodology
was used to compute the antenna imbalance:
1\. Generate an incident power distribution.
**Discrete case:** For the case where a discrete number of outgoing rays are
considered the incident power distribution is $S\left( \theta,\phi \right) =
\sum_{n = 1}^{N}{\delta\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{n} \right)}$. The directions of
the rays are described by $\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{n} \right)$. The azimuth
angle for the _n_ :th ray $\phi_{n}$ at the UE is generated from a truncated
Laplace distribution $g_{\phi_{0}}(\phi) = \frac{1}{2b}\text{exp}\left( -
\frac{\left| \phi - \phi_{0} \right|}{b} \right)$ with an angular spread
σAS=$\sqrt{2}b$ and expectation $\phi_{0}$where $\phi_{0} \in U\left( 0,2\pi
\right)$. Also note that $\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{n} \right)$ are used for
both antennas when computing the antenna imbalance for a particular
realization (if the discrete model is used).
**Continuous case:** For the case where an infinite number of departing rays
are considered the distribution of the azimuth angle is described by a Laplace
distribution $g_{\varphi_{0}}(\phi) = \frac{1}{2b}\text{exp}\left( -
\frac{\left| \phi - \phi_{0} \right|}{b} \right)$with a standard deviation σAS
=$\sqrt{2}b$. Figure 5 shows the probability distribution function that was
used to compute the antenna imbalance.
2\. For each antenna compute the power received at the receiving antenna.
**Discrete case:** For the case with a discrete number of outgoing rays this
is performed as:
$P_{i}\left( \phi_{0} \right) = \sum_{n = 1}^{N}{w_{n}\left|
{\overrightarrow{E}}_{i}(\theta_{n},\phi_{n}) \right|^{2}}$where
${\overrightarrow{E}}_{i}(\theta,\phi)$ is the far-field gain pattern for
antenna _i=1,2_ and $N$denotes the number of rays associated with the channel.
$w_{n}$ represents the relative power associated with the $n$:th ray and we
highlight that $\sum_{n = 1}^{N}w_{n} = 1$.
**Continuous case:** For the case where an infinite number of outgoing rays is
considered the energy at a specific angle of departure $\phi_{0}$ is given as:
$P_{i}(\phi_{0}) = \int_{\phi = 0}^{2\pi}{\int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi}{\left{
E_{\hat{\theta}}^{i}(\theta,\phi)E_{\hat{\theta}}^{i}(\theta,\phi)^{} +
E_{\hat{\phi}}^{i}(\theta,\phi)E_{\hat{\phi}}^{i}(\theta,\phi)^{} \right}
\cdot p_{\phi_{0}}(\theta,\phi) \cdot \text{sin}(\theta) \cdot \text{dθdϕ}}}$
where $p_{\phi_{0}}(\theta,\phi)$is the probability distribution function
describing the 3 dimensional angle of spread.
3\. Compute the antenna imbalance for the realization. In linear scale this is
given as P1(ϕ0)/P2(ϕ0) for the specific angle of departure ϕ0.
The statistics of the antenna imbalance associated with a particular device is
then obtained by computing the imbalance at different angle of departure.

distribution\ with standard deviation π/6
In [11] the antenna imbalance for devices equipped with two antennas was
evaluated. The evaluation was based on the methodology described above and it
assumed a discrete number of outgoing rays. The far-field antenna pattern of
the antennas was measured in anechoic chambers and in figure 6 the far-field
antenna gain pattern for a few of the studied devices is presented.
To obtain sufficient statistics 500,000 realizations were studied for each
device. Together the realizations were used to create an empirical
distribution of the antenna imbalance associated with the particular device.
To determine the long-term and short-term antenna imbalance a single Gaussian
model was matched to the empirical distribution. Figure 7 presents the
empirical and the matched single Gaussian model associated with the devices
for which a gain pattern was presented in figure 6.

Table 2 summarizes the standard deviation associated with the Gaussian model
for the studied devices. In [11] three different angular spreads were
considered and it should be noted that in all cases a total of 20 rays of
equal power have been considered. (This is similar to a setting where the SCM
model is used and the power associated with all clusters except the strongest
one can be neglected.)

A similar analysis as the one provided in [11] was performed in [17]. The
following cases were analyzed
**\- Line of sight scenario:** In this case the variance of the Laplace
distribution (angular spread σAS) was assumed to be zero.
**\- Non line of sight scenario:** In this case the angular spread is modelled
by the Laplace distribution with a standard deviation equal to 30 degrees.
An elevation $\theta$ of 0 and 30 degrees were studied and the antenna form
factor associated with a laptop, handset, and dongle were studied. Figure 8
shows an example of a laptop configuration with multiple antennas. Antenna
pattern measurements were made for each of the antennas shown. The antenna
imbalance is computed for two of the four antennas (Ant 2 and Ant 3).

operating in the PCS was studied. The far-field antenna pattern of this dual-
antenna device was measured in an anechoic chamber and the resulting antenna

Following the methodology described above the average difference in antenna
pattern gain for this dual-antenna device assuming a zero angular spread was
2.07 dB while the standard deviation was 2.85 dB.
In [14], imbalance measurements based on field data were presented. The tests
were performed using different antennas and in different bands. Specifically,
the antennas considered were a) Wire Inverted F Antenna (WIFA) antenna, b)
Dongle Antenna and c) Smartphone Antenna. The tests were conducted in the AWS,
PCS (1850 - 1990 MHz), IMT, and Cellular (850 MHz) bands. The data was
collected by regularly switching every 100 ms (10 frames) between the two
antennas. The results were obtained for a) stationary and mobile channel
environments, and b) indoor and outdoor settings. The data was also averaged
over time (100 ms - 1 s) periods. The latter was done to reduce the effects
due to channel variations (i.e. fast fading).
Figures 19 through 23 shows the distribution of the measured antenna imbalance
in these tests. Figure 19 shows the distribution of the short term antenna
imbalance between the two antennas collected for outdoor and indoor settings
for the AWS band. The antennas used are WIFA antennas. The data collected was
for a number of stationary channel conditions. For the long term, the two
antennas are considered to be balanced.

Measurements taken in Outdoor and Indoor environments
The mean and standard deviation was obtained from the measurements obtained
and a Gaussian curve with the observed mean and standard deviation is also
plotted. It can be seen that the ideal Gaussian curves match well with the
measured data. Note that the percentage of imbalance observed beyond 6 dB is
\~11 % for outdoor environment and \~16 % for indoor environment.
Figure 20 shows the antenna imbalance measurements for the PCS band with
dongle antennas. The data was obtained across different channel conditions.
Figure 20 shows the Gaussian equivalent of the measure data with the same mean
and standard deviation. The mean of the observed data corresponds to the long
term imbalance between the two antennas. It can be seen that the diversity
antenna is around -2 dB weaker than the primary antenna.

Figure 21 shows the antenna imbalance measurements for the IMT band with
dongle antennas. The data was obtained across different channel conditions. As
in figure 21, the long term imbalance between the two antennas is around -2
dB. The short term imbalance is well modeled by a Gaussian curve with a
standard deviation equivalent to the observed data. Note also that the
percentage of the imbalance above 6 dB, if zero mean is assumed is \~8 %.

Figure 22 shows the antenna imbalance measurements for the Cellular band with
dongle antennas. The data was obtained across different channel conditions. In
this case, the long term imbalance is seen to be around 1.4 dB. The short term
imbalance measurements fit well with the Gaussian curve with equivalent
statistics. Note that the percentage of imbalance beyond 6 dB, if assuming
zero-mean is \~ 8 %.

Figure 23 shows the antenna imbalance measurements for the PCS band with
antennas in a Smartphone. Compared to the dongles, smartphones can support
larger spatial separation and thus less correlation between the antennas. The
data was obtained by periodically switching between the antennas for a quasi-
stationary channel. Each set of measurements was recorded for a stationary
location and different measurements were recorded by changing locations. This
data corresponds to what would realistically be seen in a handset with two
transmit antennas.

Figure 23: Antenna imbalance measurements for the PCS band using handset
antennas
As in the previous test cases, the measured data is well approximated with a
Gaussian curve with equivalent second order statistics. The long term
imbalance seen is around -2 dB and the standard deviation of the short term
imbalance is seen to be 4.4 dB.
From figures 19 to 23 shown above, the following are observed:
\- The measured data can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution.
\- The long term imbalance is around -2 dB for the studied dongle and the
studied smartphone antennas.
\- The short term imbalance exceeds ±6 dB a significant portion of the time.
Based on the combined results presented in [11], [12], [13], [14], [16], [17],
[19] it was concluded that:
\- The long-term antenna imbalance can be described by a constant value taking
on the value of -4 dB and 0 dB.
\- The short-term antenna imbalance can be modelled as a zero-mean Gaussian
random variable with standard deviation 2.25 dB. These values are also
reflected in table 3 summarizing the system simulation assumptions.

### 5.3.3 Modeling of NodeB Receiver Loss in System Simulations
In this clause, we investigate the need to explicitly model the NodeB receiver
losses due to ULTD in system simulations for the simulation assumption
presented in table 1.
#### 5.3.3.1 On the need to model to NodeB Receiver Loss in System Simulations
due to Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
A link study based on the simulation assumptions in table 1 was performed in
[72] to analyze the impact to NodeB demodulator due to SATD.
Table 3b shows the average set point comparisons for the baseline, genie and
the practical algorithm for a PA3 channel. The average set point is computed
over the duration of the simulation.
Table 3b: Set point comparison between baseline, genie and practical
algorithms

Average Set point [dB] -18.63 -18.68 -18.62
* * *
It can be seen from table 3a that the difference in the average set point for
all the three schemes is \ frames are lost.
The performance measures have previously been summarized in [18].
In addition, for the bursty traffic model, the following performance metrics
are considered:
\- Average user burst rate.
\- 10^th^ percentile user burst rate.
It should be noted that the bursty traffic model employed in this
investigation assumed a large file size and offered load levels of 0-1 Mbps.
The BLER operating point was 10 % after 1 transmission, which differs from the
HARQ operating point for the full buffer simulations in the present document
(1 Mbps represents full loading at this operating point but is somewhat lower
than full loading at a larger retransmission rate). All UEs were assumed to
transmit DPCCH continuously and thus a constant stream of TPC commands was
made available to the practical TxD algorithms. A full assessment of bursty
traffic performance should consider also small burst sizes, the effect of CPC
and the effect of state transitions.

### 6.1.4 HS-DPCCH Performance in Soft Handover with Switched Antenna Transmit
Diversity
#### 6.1.4.1 Notation
**GTx1- >A**: The antenna gain for the link from Antenna 1 (Tx1) to A which is
the serving NodeB.
**GTx2- >A**: The antenna gain for the link from Antenna 2 (Tx2) to A which is
the serving NodeB.
**GTx1- >B**: The antenna gain for the link from Antenna 1 (Tx1) to B which is
the non-serving NodeB.
**GTx2- >B**: The antenna gain for the link from Antenna 2 (Tx2) to B which is
the non-serving NodeB.
**IA- >B**: The imbalance between the two links from UE Antenna 1 to A and
from UE Antenna 1 to B where A and B are the two NodeB\'s in the active set.
The UE is in soft handover. In other words **IA- >B = GTx1->A - GTx1->B**.
These variables along with the simulation framework are shown in figure 27.
{width="4.314583333333333in" height="3.2979166666666666in"}
Figure 27: Simulation framework where the UE is in soft handover\ with Serving
NodeB A and Non-Serving NodeB B
The imbalance between the antennas (Tx1 and Tx2) is different for the links to
the serving and non-serving NodeB\'s. They are indicated below:
> **IUE- >A = GTx1->A - GTx2->A:** The imbalance between the two transmit
> antennas Tx1 and Tx2 for the radio link to the serving NodeB A.
>
> **IUE- >B = GTx1->B - GTx2->B:** The imbalance between the two transmit
> antennas Tx1 and Tx2 for the radio link to the non-serving NodeB B.
It is assumed in the simulation that the path loss to the serving and non-
serving NodeB\'s are the same. Therefore:
**IA- >B = GTx1->A - GTx1->B = 0 dB**.
#### 6.1.4.2 HS-DPCCH Performance
Table 24 shows the HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK Miss detection and Decoding error rate
performance when SATD is applied at the UE. In this simulation framework, the
UE is in soft handover with two cells in the active set.

### 6.1.5 Sensitivity with respect to the BLER operating point
The evaluations presented above have been performed at an operating point
where the residual BLER target after the 4^th^ transmission is 1 %. In this
section we therefore evaluate the relative gain in Tx and Rx Ec/No as a
function of different BLER targets (after the first transmission). Note that
the evaluation only is performed for the case where the antenna imbalance is 0
dB.
Table 26 presents the relative gain in Tx Ec/N0 and table 27 presents the
relative gain in Rx Ec/No for different BLER levels for the switched antenna
diversity algorithms.

#### 6.2.2.1 Results for a Practical Node-B
The impact of uplink beamforming transmit diversity (BF) on a practical NodeB
receiver is assessed using Practical BFTD Algorithm 1 described in section
4.3.2. It is assumed that the UE applies a given practical BF algorithm
independently of NodeB (i.e. without informing NodeB) and there are no
modifications of practical NodeB receiver algorithms.
The simulation assumptions used for Open Loop (OL) beamforming antenna
transmit diversity are a subset of the assumptions in section 5.1. This
simulation was conducted using 2 ms TTI with a TBS of 2020 without outer loop
power control. Additionally, the antenna imbalance was assumed to be 0 dB and
the Tx and Rx antenna correlations were assumed to be 0. UE DTX was also
turned off.
The relative Rx Ec/No gain values for different channel propagation
environments are tabulated in table 37a.

### 6.2.3 HS-DPCCH Performance in Soft Handover with Beamforming Transmit
Diversity
#### 6.2.3.1 Notation
In this contribution, the following variables are used.
**GTx1- >A**: The antenna gain for the link from Antenna 1 (Tx1) to A which is
the serving NodeB.
**GTx2- >A**: The antenna gain for the link from Antenna 2 (Tx2) to A which is
the serving NodeB.
**GTx1- >B**: The antenna gain for the link from Antenna 1 (Tx1) to B which is
the non-serving NodeB.
**GTx2- >B**: The antenna gain for the link from Antenna 2 (Tx2) to B which is
the non-serving NodeB.
**IA- >B**: The imbalance between the two links from UE Antenna 1 to A and
from UE Antenna 1 to B where A and B are the two NodeB\'s in the active set.
The UE is in soft handover. In other words **IA- >B = GTx1->A- GTx1->B**.
These variables along with the simulation framework are shown in figure 28.
{width="4.314583333333333in" height="3.2979166666666666in"}
Figure 28: Simulation framework where the UE is in soft handover\ with Serving
NodeB A and Non-Serving NodeB B
The imbalance between the antennas (Tx1 and Tx2) is different for the links to
the serving and non-serving NodeB\'s. They are indicated below:
> **IUE- >A = GTx1->A - GTx2->A:** The imbalance between the two transmit
> antennas Tx1 and Tx2 for the radio link to the serving NodeB A.
>
> **IUE- >B = GTx1->B - GTx2->B:** The imbalance between the two transmit
> antennas Tx1 and Tx2 for the radio link to the non-serving NodeB B.
In this simulation, it is assumed that the path loss to the serving and non-
serving NodeB cells are the same i.e. **IA‑ >B = GTx1->A- GTx1->B = 0 dB**
which can be considered as a worst case scenario and rather unlikely.
The beamforming algorithm operates on the combined TPC command that is finally
applied to the UE transmit power.
#### 6.2.3.2 HS-DPCCH Performance
Table 37b shows the HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK Miss detection and Decoding error rate
performance when BFTD is applied at the UE.

In a real system, SHO may include more radio links and link imbalances of a
few dB may be encountered, and the probability of radio links with 0 dB
imbalance is very low. The HS-DPCCH impact due to BFTD for UEs in SHO
conditions with > 0 dB radio link imbalance could be much smaller than what
tables 37a, 37b, 38a and 38b implies.
## 6.3 Uplink Transmit Diversity Link Level Simulations with Discontinuous
Transmission
### 6.3.1 Discontinuous transmission description
Voice over IP service of 160 kbps was simulated for practical switched antenna
and beamforming transmit diversity schemes. One data packet was generated
every 16 ms. DPCCH transmission precedes data transmission on E‑DPDCH by 2
slots and follows it by 1 slot totalling 4 ms (6 slots) of DPCCH transmission
every 16 ms.
### 6.3.2 Link level simulation results
Gain due to DTX columns in the following tables compare the Tx diversity gains
achieved in the presence of DTX with the gains achieved in the absence of DTX
(negative value indicates less improvement when discontinuous transmission is
present).

## 6.4 Uplink Transmit Diversity Link Level Simulations with Soft Handover
### 6.4.1 Soft Handover Simulations Description
This section presents some link level results including soft handover to
illustrate SHO impact due to ULTD. Two scenarios are considered:
\- 2 way soft handover with equal link power; and
\- 2 way SHO with 2dB imbalance.
In a real system SHO may include more radio links and link imbalances of a few
dB may be encountered, and the probability of radio links with 0 dB imbalance
is very low. The SHO impact for UEs with > 2 dB radio link imbalance could be
much smaller than what tables 39a and 39b imply.
An antenna imbalance of 0 dB is assumed, and 0 % correlation. Other simulation
results align with section 5.1.
### 6.4.2 Link Level Simulations Results
This section presents terminal TX power gains and RX Ec/N0 power gains
(positive value indicates smaller Ec/N0 compared to reference) obtained with
the practical algorithms. The reference case is a single TX antenna setup in
soft handover. Results for radio links imbalance 0, -2 dB are performed with
Tx antenna imbalance 0 dB and correlation 0 %.

## 6.5 Uplink Transmit Diversity Link Level Simulations with Incorrect TPC
command delay
The results presented in this section correspond to the Practical BFTD
algorithm 2 described in section 4.3 and to practical SATD algorithm described
in section 4.3.1. The simulation assumptions used are a subset of assumptions
in section 5.1 (simulation assumptions of higher priority). The simulations
were conducted using 2ms TTI with a TBS of 2020\. Additionally, the antenna
imbalance was assumed to be 0 dB and UE DTX and Soft Handover were turned off.
The $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ _for the_ Practical BFTD algorithm 2 _were
assumed to be_ 12^o^ and 25^o^ respectively.
In table 39c, set of link level results is presented to assess the impact of
the UE assuming an incorrect TPC command delay. This assumption is especially
important for the beamforming algorithm which was described in section 4.3,
which is a scheme that measures the link quality (as indicated by TPC commands
from the Node B) after each adjustment of the antenna weights. For the loop to
operate correctly, it is necessary that the association between the weight
adjustment timing and the TPC feedback is correct.
Simulations results in other sections of this report were generated under the
assumption that the TPC delay is known to the terminal. However, the TPC
command delay, and more generally, the power control behaviour in the Node B
is not mandated by the specifications. Thus, the delay, among other
parameters, is vendor and deployment specific, including dependency on
propagation delay or cell size, or conceivably even on hardware loading.

## 6.6 Uplink Transmit Diversity Link Level Simulations with Multipath
Propagation
The results presented in this section correspond to the Practical BFTD
algorithm 2 described in section 4.3.2 and to practical SATD algorithm
described in section 4.3.1. The simulation assumptions used are a subset of
assumptions in section 5.1 (simulation assumptions of higher priority). The
simulations were conducted using 2 ms TTI with a TBS of 2020\. Additionally,
the antenna imbalance was assumed to be 0 dB and UE DTX and Soft Handover were
turned off. The $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ _for the_ Practical BFTD algorithm
2 _were assumed to be_ 12^o^ and 25^o^ respectively.
Table 39d shows the Tx diversity gains obtained for different Tx antenna
correlation and under a range of propagation conditions.

## 6.7 Conclusion on Link Evaluation Results
### 6.7.1 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
The simulation results with practically implementable algorithms on switched
antenna transmit diversity for balanced and uncorrelated antennae show that in
PedA 3 km/h channel, a reduction (gain) up to 1.42 dB in the UE uplink
transmit power can be achieved. In VehA 30 km/h channel, UE transmit power
more similar to that of the single antenna case can be observed, difference
ranging from 0.15 dB loss to 0.2 dB gain. For more stringent BLER targets
compared to the reference (1 % residual BLER after 4^th^ transmission) worse
performance - smaller UE Tx power gains or larger losses - are observed.
In the presence of antenna correlation (balanced antennae), the Tx power gains
in PedA 3 km/h channel are somewhat smaller than in case of no antenna
correlation. Similarly the loss observed in VehA 30 km/h channel is somewhat
reduced.
In the presence of antenna imbalance (uncorrelated antennae), for both studied
channels (PedA 3 km/h and VehA 30 km/h), when the secondary antenna has lower
gain than the primary (reference) antenna, up to 1.25 dB increase (loss) in UE
Tx power is observed. When the secondary antenna has higher gain than the
primary (reference) antenna, reductions (gain) up to 2.06 dB to 3.2 dB in UE
Tx powers is seen.
In all simulated cases (PedA 3 km/h and VehA 30 km/h channels for uncorrelated
and balanced, uncorrelated and imbalanced, and correlated and balanced
antennae), no gains were observed, but typically an increase (loss) up to 0.73
dB is observed for the Node B Rx Ec/No. For more stringent BLER targets
compared to the reference (1 % residual BLER after 4^th^ transmission) an
increased loss in Node B Rx Ec/No is observed.
When the maximum switching frequency is reduced from 100 Hz to 50 Hz or 25 Hz,
an overall reduction in the UE Tx power performance is seen - gains decrease
or loss increase. Typically, but not consistently a somewhat smaller loss is
observed in the Node B Rx Ec/No.
### 6.7.2 Beamforming Transmit Diversity
The simulation results with practically implementable algorithms on
beamforming antenna transmit diversity for balanced and uncorrelated antennae
show that in PedA 3 km/h channel, a reduction (gain) in the range of 1.0 dB to
2.77 dB in the UE uplink transmit power can be achieved. In VehA 30 km/h
channel, UE transmit powers range from 1.46 dB loss to 0.54 dB gain relative
to the single antenna case.
In the presence of antenna correlation (balanced antennae), the Tx power gains
in PedA 3 km/h channel increase slightly and VehA 30 km/h channel shows UE
transmit powers ranging from 0.8 dB loss to 2.15 dB gain.
In the presence of antenna imbalance (uncorrelated antennae), when the
secondary antenna has lower gain than the primary (reference) antenna, for
PedA 3 km/h Tx power performance ranging from 1.26 dB loss to 1.27 dB gain is
observed. For VehA 30 km/h all simulated cases indicate loss from 0.83 dB to
2.2 dB. When the secondary antenna has higher gain than the primary
(reference) antenna, significant gains up to 4.24 dB are observed for PedA 3
km/h channel. For VehA 30 km/h channel a range from small loss to 2.2 dB gain
in UE Tx power is seen.
In all simulated cases (PedA 3 km/h and VehA 30 km/h channels for uncorrelated
and balanced, uncorrelated and imbalanced, and correlated and balanced
antennae) an increase (loss) typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 dB is
observed for the Node B Rx Ec/No although in some cases loss up to 2.1 dB and
gain up to 0.23 dB is seen.

##### 7.1.1.1.5 Results for 0 dB long-term antenna imbalance and 2D antennas
with 50 % penetration of SATD terminals
Additional simulations were performed by one company to investigate the
performance of SATD in a situation where the penetrations of UL TxD was only
50 %. In these simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same
TxD algorithm. Other penetration levels have not been checked. The results
suggest that:
\- Where the penetration level is 50 %, there is no net system capacity gain
from UL SATD.
\- The 10^th^ percentile throughput of non TX diversity UEs seems to increase
slightly in the 1 km cell.
Some inconsistencies were noted in the results.
Tables 48a2 and 48b presents the average user data rates, the 10^th^
percentile user data rates and the average transmit power for the different
user densities that was studied for a PA3 channel when the inter-site distance
is 1 km and only 50 % of the terminals are operating SATD (with the remaining
50 % being legacy terminals). Both absolute and relative numbers are
presented. Table 48a2 presents the numbers for TX diversity terminals, and
Table 48b for legacy terminals. All relative numbers are presented with
respect to baseline case (without transmit diversity for any terminals).

##### 7.1.1.1.6 Results for 0 dB long-term antenna imbalance and 2D antennas
with 25 % penetration of SATD terminals and 1 000 m ISD
Additional simulations were performed by one company to investigate the
performance of SATD in a situation where the penetrations of UL TxD was only
25 %. In these simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same
TxD algorithm. Only 25 % of the terminals are operating SATD with the

The results suggest that for 1km ISD:
\- Where the penetration level is 25 %, there is no net system capacity gain
from UL SATD with non-ideal algorithms.
\- Depending on the load the average user throughput is either decreased or
improved slightly for both user groups.
\- Similarly depending on the load the 10^th^ percentile throughput and the
average transmit power is either slightly decreased or increased.

##### 7.1.1.1.7 Results for 0 dB long-term antenna imbalance and 2D antennas
with 75 % penetration of SATD terminals and 1 000 m ISD
Additional simulations were performed by one company to investigate the
performance of SATD in a situation where the penetrations of UL TxD was 75 %.
In these simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same TxD
algorithm. 75 % of the terminals are operating SATD with the remaining 25 %
being legacy, non TX‑diversity terminals. The results are split to three sub-
sections, first including the total cell throughputs and two latter looking at
the performance of TX-diversity and non TX-diversity users separately.
The results suggest that for 1km ISD:
\- Where the penetration level is 75 %, in certain cases there is some system
capacity gain from UL SATD.
\- In the PA3 conditions the average user throughput in increased for TX-
diversity users, and a minor improvement seen for non TX diversity users. In
VA30 conditions, either minor improvement or loss is seen depending on the
load.
\- Depending on the load the 10^th^ percentile throughput and average transmit
power is either slightly decreased or increased.

50 %. In these simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same
TxD algorithm. Other penetration levels have not been checked. The results
suggest that:
\- Where the penetration level is 50 %, there is no net system capacity gain
from UL SATD.
\- In a 2.8 km cell, the 10^th^ percentile user throughput for non diversity
users may be reduced.
Some inconsistencies were noted in the results.
Tables 54 and 55 present the average user data rates, the 10^th^ percentile
user data rates and the average transmit power for the different user
densities that was studied for a PA3 channel when the inter-site distance is
2.8 km and only 50 % of the terminals are operating SATD (with the remaining
50 % being legacy terminals). Both absolute and relative numbers are
presented. Table 54 presents the numbers for TX diversity terminals, and table
55 for legacy terminals. All relative numbers are presented with respect to
baseline case (without transmit diversity for any terminals).

##### 7.1.1.2.4 Results for 0 dB long-term antenna imbalance and 2D antennas
with 25 % penetration of SATD terminals and 2 800 m ISD
Additional simulations were performed by one company to investigate the
performance of SATD in a situation where the penetrations of UL TxD was only
25 %. In these simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same
TxD algorithm. Only 25 % of the terminals are operating SATD with the
remaining 75 % being legacy, non TX‑diversity terminals. The results are split
to three sub-sections, first including the total cell throughputs and two
latter looking at the performance of TX-diversity and non TX-diversity users
separately.
The results suggest that for 2.8 km ISD:
\- Where the penetration level is 25 %, there is no net system capacity gain
or loss from UL SATD with non‑ideal algorithms.
\- Depending on the load the average user throughput in increased or decreased
for both user groups.
\- Depending on the load the 10^th^ percentile throughput is improved for the
TX-diversity users, while average transmit power does not show significant
difference compared to the baseline.
\- Depending on the load the 10^th^ percentile throughput of non TX-diversity
users is either increased or decreased, however some loss was seen at VA30
channel.

##### 7.1.1.2.5 Results for 0 dB long-term antenna imbalance and 2D antennas
with 75 % penetration of SATD terminals and 2 800 m ISD
Additional simulations were performed by one company to investigate the

In these simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same TxD
algorithm. 75 % of the terminals are operating SATD with the remaining 25 %
being legacy, non TX-diversity terminals. The results are split to three sub-
sections, first including the total cell throughputs and two latter looking at

The results suggest that for 2.8 km ISD:
\- Where the penetration level is 75 %, there is no net system capacity gain
from UL SATD with non-ideal algorithms
\- Depending on the load the average user throughput in increased or decreased

#### 7.1.1.3 Sensitivity to BLER target
The results presented in previous sections are based on the parameters
presented in section 5.3.2. In particular, all except [49] are based on a
setting where the residual BLER target after the 4^th^ transmission is 1 %.
The subsection evaluates the relative gain in average data rates of the
practical antenna switching algorithm (with respect to the base line case).
This is presented in figure 29 for two different loads. From the figure it can
be observed that the performance gain stemming from antenna switching
algorithms reduce as the BLER target becomes more stringent.

(compared to the reference case) as a function of the BLER after first
transmission [45]
#### 7.1.1.4 System performance evaluation for suboptimal SATD algorithms
Since the uplink transmit diversity algorithm applied at the UE is
unspecified, it is important to widen the scope for the system evaluations by
considering the system performance impact due to sub-optimal transmit
diversity algorithms. The studied algorithm is detailed in section 4.3.1.1.
Figure 30 presents the average user data rate as a function of the cell
throughput for a PA3 channel when the long term antenna imbalance is 0 dB and
‑4 dB respectively. Figure 31 shows the 10^th^ percentile user throughput for
a PA3 when the long-term antenna imbalance is 0 dB and -4 dB.

##### 7.2.1.1.5 Results for 0 dB long-term antenna imbalance and 2D antennas
with 50 % beamforming UE penetration
Additional simulations were performed to investigate the performance of BFTD
in a situation where the penetrations of UL TxD was only 50 %. In these
simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same TxD algorithm.
Other penetration levels have not been checked. The results suggest that:
\- Where the penetration level is 50 %, there is a smaller net system capacity
and cell edge throughput gain from UL BFTD than is the case with 100 %
penetration.
\- Non TX diversity users do not necessarily benefit from BFTD applied by the
other users in the 1km cell.
Tables 71 and 72 present the average user data rates, the 10^th^ percentile
user data rates and the average transmit power for the different user
densities that was studied for a PA3 channel when the inter-site distance is 1
km and only 50 % of the terminals are operating beamforming (with the
remaining 50 % being legacy terminals). Both absolute and relative numbers are
presented. Table 71 presents the numbers for TX diversity terminals, and table
72 for legacy terminals. All relative numbers are presented with respect to
baseline case (without transmit diversity for any terminals).

Table 73 and 74 presents the average user data rates, the 10^th^ percentile
user data rates and the average transmit power for the studied user densities
in a VA30 channel when the inter-site distance is 1 km and only 50 % of the
terminals are operating beamforming (with the remaining 50 % being legacy
terminals). Both absolute and relative numbers are presented. Table 73
presents the numbers for TX diversity terminals, and table 74 for legacy
terminals. All relative numbers are presented with respect to baseline case
(without transmit diversity for any terminals).

##### 7.2.1.1.6 Results for 0 dB long-term antenna imbalance and 2D antennas
with 25 % penetration of BFTD terminals and 1 000 m ISD
Additional simulations were performed by one company to investigate the
performance of BFTD in a situation where the penetrations of UL TxD was 25 %.
In these simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same TxD
algorithm. Only 25 % of the terminals are operating BFTD with the remaining 75
% being legacy, non TX‑diversity terminals. The results are split to two sub-
sections according to the user groups present in the simulation scenario,
first including the performance of TX-diversity users and of the non TX-
diversity users.
The results suggest that for 1 000 m ISD:
\- Gains depending on the assume load are seen for the TX-diversity users in
average throughput, whereas predominantly only losses are seen for the non-TX-
diversity users.
\- The 10^th^ percentile throughput of TX diversity UEs seems to increase,
while the throughput of non TX-diversity users either decreased or increased
depending on the load.

##### 7.2.1.2.3 Results for 0 dB long-term antenna imbalance and 2D antennas
with 50 % beamforming UE penetration
Additional simulations were performed by one company to investigate the
performance of BFTD in a situation where the penetrations of UL TxD was only
50 %. In these simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same
TxD algorithm. Other penetration levels have not been checked. The results
suggest that:
\- Where the penetration level is 50 %, there is a smaller net system capacity
and cell edge throughput gain from UL BFTD than is the case with 100 %
penetration.
\- Non TX diversity users suffer significant throughput losses where BFTD is
applied by the other users in the 2.8 km cell.
Tables 80 and 81 present the average user data rates, the 10^th^ percentile
user data rates and the average transmit power for the different user
densities that was studied for a PA3 channel when the inter-site distance is
2.8 km and only 50 % of the terminals are operating beamforming (with the
remaining 50 % being legacy terminals). Both absolute and relative numbers are
presented. Table 80 presents the numbers for TX diversity terminals, and table
81 for legacy terminals. All relative numbers are presented with respect to
baseline case (without transmit diversity for any terminals).

##### 7.2.1.2.4 Results for 0 dB long-term antenna imbalance and 2D antennas
with 25 % penetration of BFTD terminals and 2 800 m ISD
Additional simulations were performed by one company to investigate the
performance of BFTD in a situation where the penetrations of UL TxD was 25 %.
In these simulations, all TX diversity UEs are assumed to use the same TxD
algorithm. Only 25 % of the terminals are operating BFTD with the remaining 75
% being legacy, non TX‑diversity terminals. The results are split to two sub-
sections according to the user groups present in the simulation scenario,
first including the performance of TX-diversity users and of the non TX-
diversity users.
The results suggest that for 2 800 m ISD:
\- Average user throughput of TX-diversity users is improved, while non TX-
diversity user see some loss.
\- Larger gains can be seen in the TX-diversity users 10^th^ percentile
throughput, but losses can be seen for non TX-diversity users.

## 7.3 Conclusion on System Evaluation Results
In the following subsection the system level results are summarized according
to the inter-site distance and the transmit diversity algorithms. The
conclusions are based on system simulations performed under the following
assumptions:
\- Full buffer traffic.
\- Zero transmit antenna correlation.
\- 100 % of the UE population applied the same algorithm (SATD, BFTD or no
ULTD).
\- Impacts on the performance of the NodeB receiver algorithms arising due to
transmit diversity algorithms (for example, due to channel estimation) were
not explicitly modelled in these simulations. However, variations in received
signal levels or the DPCCH set point due to the transmit diversity algorithms
are implicitly captured in the simulations.
\- The uplink power control algorithm (at NodeB) is based on a SIR target
comparison where an UP (DOWN) command is always assumed to be sent if the
measured SIR is below (above) the SIR target.
\- Some of the simulations used ideal signal to interference ratio (SIR)
estimation at the NodeB.
\- The indoor-to-outdoor penetration was modelled by a constant 10 dB loss
which was applied to all the UE\'s.
\- Antenna efficiencies and other antenna impairments, including variations of
antenna gain for different angles of departure have been incorporated by the
short-term and long term antenna imbalance. See section 5.3.1.
### 7.3.1 Switched antenna diversity
#### 7.3.1.1 Inter-site distance 1 km
For a slow fading low dispersive channel (PedA 3 kmph), the gains in the
average and 10^th^ percentile user throughputs ranged between 2 % and 10 %.
When one considered 3D antenna patterns, the gains were somewhat lower (see
table 43). The UE transmit power reduction was around 1 dB.
For a faster fading and more dispersive channel (VehA 30 kmph), there were no
significant gains or losses in average and 10^th^ percentile user throughputs.
The UE transmit power reduction was around 0.5 dB.
When the long term antenna imbalance was -4 dB, the user throughput gains were
negligible for both types of channels and the UE transmit power was higher
(see tables 45 to 47).
#### 7.3.1.2 Inter-site distance 2.8 km
For a slow fading low dispersive channel (PedA 3 kmph), the gains in the
average throughput was around 5 %. For the 10^th^ percentile user throughputs,
the gains in this scenario were inconsistent amongst companies (see table 49)
and were in the range of 10 % to 40 %. A possible reason for this variation
could be different MAC‑e scheduler designs. In addition, some companies noted
that they did not consider PA3 to be a representative channel for users near
the edge of a 2.8 km cell due to its low level of dispersion. The UE transmit
power reduction was between 0.5 dB and 2 dB.
For a faster fading and more dispersive channel (VehA 30 kmph), the gains in
the average throughput were less than 4 %. For the 10^th^ percentile user
throughputs, the gains ranged from 0 % to 20 % and were again inconsistent
amongst companies. The UE transmit power reduction was between 0 dB and 0.5
dB.
From the above observations, it is seen that at least for some MAC-e scheduler
designs, switched antenna transmit diversity could offer gains in cell-edge
throughput in both slow and fast fading channels under this scenario.
### 7.3.2 Beam forming antenna diversity
#### 7.3.2.1 Inter-site distance 1 km
For a slow fading low dispersive channel (PedA 3 kmph), the gains in the
average and 10^th^ percentile user throughputs ranged between 4 % and 20 %.
When one considered 3D antenna patterns, the gains were somewhat lower (see
table 65). The UE transmit power reduction was around 1.5 dB.
For a faster fading and more dispersive channel (VehA 30 kmph), there were no
significant gains or losses in average and 10^th^ percentile user throughputs.
The UE transmit power reduction was around 0.5 dB.
When the long term antenna imbalance was -4 dB, the user throughput gains were
negligible for both types of channels and the UE transmit power was higher
(see tables 67 and 68).
#### 7.3.2.2 Inter-site distance 2.8 km
For a slow fading low dispersive channel (PedA 3 kmph), the gains in the
average throughput ranged between 5 % and 20 %. For the 10^th^ percentile user
throughputs, the gains in this scenario were inconsistent amongst companies
(see table 62) and were in the range of 10 % to 60 %. A possible reason for
this variation could be different MAC‑e scheduler designs. In addition, some
companies noted that they did not consider PA3 to be a representative channel
for users near the edge of a 2.8 km cell due to its low level of dispersion.
The UE transmit power reduction was between 0.5 dB and 2.5 dB.
For a faster fading and more dispersive channel (VehA 30 kmph), the gains in
the average throughput were less than 3 %. For the 10^th^ percentile user
throughputs, gains up to 20 % were observed but were again inconsistent
amongst companies. For some MAC-e scheduler designs, zero gains or small
losses were seen (see table 75) with zero Tx antenna correlation. The UE
transmit power reduction was between 0 dB and 0.6 dB.
From the above observations, it is seen that at least for some MAC-e scheduler
designs, beamforming transmit diversity could offer gains in cell-edge
throughput in both slow and fast fading channels under this scenario.
# 8 Impacts on UE Implementation
## 8.1 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
In figure 32, a block diagram of a single band capable SATD UE transmitter is
shown. As seen in figure 32, the transmit chain is identical to a legacy UE
that transmits on a single antenna only, until the output of the Power
Amplifier (PA).
The SATD UE differs from a non-ULTD legacy UE as follows:
\- Antenna Selection Logic to decide which transmit antenna the UE should
transmit on. One example of this logic is described in section 4.3.1, wherein
the logic to decide to switch or not is based on accumulated TPC commands fed
back from the NodeB to the UE. In the studies presented in the report, this
nominal rate at which this logic can be executed is once per radio frame.
\- Additional duplexer for the 2^nd^ transmit antenna.
\- 2^nd^ transmit antenna[^1].
\- RF Switch to switch between one of the duplexer/antennas.

## 8.2 Beamforming Transmit Diversity
In figures 33 and 34, a block diagram of a single band capable BFTD UE
transmitter is shown. As seen in figure 33, the transmit chain is identical to
a legacy UE that transmits on a single antenna only, until the output of the
modulation block. It should be noted that to ensure that there is no impact to
the PRACH coverage at least one of the two PAs would need to be of full power.
With respect to Figure 34 it should also be noted that this report has only
studied algorithms in which $\alpha = 1/2$. To support beamforming algorithm
where $\alpha$ is allowed to vary between 0 and 1 may require two full power
PAs.

Figure 34: Beamforming Logic based on a symmetric implementation of a beam
forming algortihm
The BFTD UE differs from a non-ULTD legacy UE as follows:
\- Introduction of a beamforming block at the output of the modulation block.
  * Note that the beamforming block could be implemented in digital > base-band and performed prior to RF modulation. In that case, > there may be a need to introduce an additional Digital to Analogue > converter (DAC).
\- There are 2 aspects to the beamforming block:
  * Selection of beamforming weights: An example of the logic based on > processing TPC commands fed back from the NodeB to the UE can be > found in the reference beamforming algorithm described in > section 4.3.2. The nominal rate at which the logic is executed is > once every radio slot (0.667 ms).
  * Application of beamforming weights: The details of the processing > involved are shown in figure 3 for the case of asymmetric > beamforming. In the most general case, the UE applies an amplitude > and a phase offset between the two transmit paths. Note that with > reference to the logic in figure 3, an additional complex > multiplier would be needed for the case of symmetric beamforming.
\- The amplitude and phase offset may belong to a finite quantized set.
\- Note that in order to avoid implementing two full power PAs $\alpha$ would
need to be restricted. Even in this case however BFTD UEs would need to have
one full power PA so that they can perform PRACH according to legacy
procedures.
\- Additional power amplifier (PA).
  * This in turn requires an additional PA calibration procedure.
\- Additional duplexer for the 2^nd^ transmit antenna.
\- 2^nd^ transmit antenna[^2].
### 8.2.1 UE Implementation Impact to maintain PRACH Coverage
In the case when a BFTD capable UE has at least one full-power PA, in Idle and
CELL_FACH state, the UE could perform legacy RACH procedures as defined today
without enabling BFTD. However even in this case, it may still be possible to
operate as if the BFTD UE utilizes two half power PAs in CELL_DCH. For
example, in figure 35, the BFTD UE uses a full-power PA for the primary
transmit antenna and a half-power PA for the diversity transmit antenna.
During regular data transmission in CELL_DCH, when BFTD is enabled, the UE
changes the primary full‑power PA\'s supply voltage using the technique of
dynamic voltage scaling or average power tracking to improve its efficiency at
mid-to-high Tx power, effectively approximating a half-power PA\'s efficiency
performance. It should however be noted that in order to avoid potential
performance degradations associated with PRACH coverage it would be necessary
to require (and test) that BFTD capable UEs only transmit from one antenna in
other states than CELL_DCH.

## 8.3 Summary of UE Implementation Impact due to ULTD

be summarized in table 86 for both SATD and BFTD UEs.

# 9 Impacts on UE Core Tx Requirements
## 9.1 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
As the study item allows for any arbitrary SATD UE algorithm, the baseline
assumption is that all existing requirements shall be fulfilled, on each of
the antenna ports. However, a UE that is only capable of SATD, i.e. not
capable of BFTD, is likely to utilize a single transmit chain until the PA
output, regardless of which antenna is active. Since the addition of a
secondary duplexer does not affect most of the existing core Tx requirements,
it may be unnecessary to test against all the existing core Tx requirements
with the UE configured to transmit on the second transmit chain.
Because of expected additional transmitter circuitry such as switches,
duplexers etc. it is expected that the maximum output power needs to be
reduced. In case the maximum power is not reduced, larger and more expensive
PA modules will be needed. Such PA\'s are expected to consume more power, with
a consequence that there is a risk that the expected battery life savings
related to the feature could diminish. However, if such large PAs are used,
the transmit power reduction as observed at the antenna port outputs will
still be realized.
### 9.1.1 Impact on UE Core Tx Requirements
In figure 36, a block diagram of an example of a SATD UE transmitter is shown.
As seen in Figure 36, the transmit chain is identical to a legacy UE that
transmits on a single antenna only, until the output of the power amplifier
(PA)
The exemplified SATD UE differs from a non-ULTD legacy UE as follows:
\- Antenna Selection Logic to decide which transmit antenna the UE should
transmit on.
\- Additional duplexer for the 2^nd^ transmit antenna.
\- 2^nd^ transmit antenna (only if a non-ULTD legacy UE does not support Rx
diversity).
\- RF Switch to switch between one of the duplexer/antennas.

Considering the similarity of the two Tx chains as shown in figure 36, the
difference between the two Tx chains is due to the different duplexers and
different paths inside the switch. Since the different paths inside the switch
can be assumed negligible, we can assume that the duplexer is a main source of
difference. Since a UE that is only capable of SATD, utilizes a single,
common, transmit chain until the PA output and the duplexer does not affect
most of existing core Tx requirements, there is no need to test against all
core Tx requirements again with the second transmit chain when the UE is
operating in SATD mode.
When we restrict the applicability of SATD tests to only single carrier
operation on the uplink, the following test methodology is proposed:
\- Perform core UE transmitter tests as currently defined in 3GPP TS 25.101 on
the primary antenna:
  * Due to the insertion of additional switch for SATD as shown in > figure 36 in the UL Tx chain, there might be some impact on > maximum UL transmit power. In order to maintain the same PA size, > we may need to reduce the maximum UL transmit power by the amount > of additional insertion loss due to the switch.
\- Perform only the following core UE transmitter tests as currently defined
in 25.101 on the secondary or diversity antenna:
  * UE maximum output power (6.2.1).
  * Spurious Emissions (6.6.3).
  * Error Vector Magnitude (6.8.2).
The motivation here is to test only those UE transmitter characteristics that
might differ due to a mismatch in the duplexer filter responses. In addition,
to ensure that the UE operating an SATD will not cause any detrimental effects
to overall system performance, new core Tx requirements are recommended in
section 10.1.
### 9.1.2 Impact on UE Core Rx Requirements
Due to the SATD operation, at any given time, the UE could transmit through
one of the duplexer/antenna pairs. As a result, it may be useful to
additionally verify that the UE meets the REFSENS requirement using the
diversity receive path when the UE transmits with maximum output power on each
diversity transmit path of the duplexer/antenna pairs. The main purpose of
this test is to verify the duplexer isolation in the diversity chain. A
suitable test methodology is as follows:
\- Perform UE Rx core tests as currently defined in 3GPP TS 25.101 by
configuring the UE to transmit on the primary transmit antenna.
\- Perform the REFSENS test with the diversity receive path by configuring the
UE to transmit on the secondary or diversity transmit antenna.
## 9.2 Beamforming Transmit Diversity
_Provide impacts on UE core Tx requirements due to the practical algorithm(s)
considered in this study for beamforming transmit diversity._
# 10 New UE Core Tx Requirements
## 10.1 Test Feasibility
It may be difficult by way of a RAN4 test requirement to fully ensure that the
UE transmit diversity algorithms do not degrade system performance. For this
purpose, higher layer signaling to enable/disable the uplink transmit
diversity transmission could be considered as a possible method to mitigate
some of these concerns that cannot be addressed with RAN4 testing or
performance requirements.
## 10.2 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
### 10.2.1 Antenna Switching Rate
Based on the link and system study of the genie algorithm as described in
section 4.2.1 and the practical SATD algorithm as described in section 4.3.1,
a new transmit core requirement for SATD devices can be considered that should
limit the transmit antenna switching rate in terms of the number of antenna
switches per second for corresponding algorithms. The purpose of introducing
such a limit on the antenna switching rate is to upper bound the potential
impact that could be caused at the NodeB receiver (for example channel
estimation, etc.).
The additional Tx core requirement to test for the antenna switching rate
could be verified with a test setup as shown in figure 37. Since the criteria
which the UE rely on when deciding whether or not to switch antenna is unknown
(TPC commands represents one out of many possible criteria). Note that it
could be challenging to design a test that can ensure that a particular SATD
algorithm complies with this requirement.
{width="4.836805555555555in" height="2.5625in"}
Figure 37: Testing Antenna Switching Rate in SATD devices
At a high level, the test setup can be summarized as follows:
\- System Simulator (SS) sets up a call with the UE.
\- Once the UE is in CELL_DCH, SS sends a dummy pattern of TPC bits to UE:
  * The choice of dummy TPC pattern is TBD and can be determined based > on collecting traces of TPC bits from a link simulation.
\- SS detects when an antenna switch happens by sensing the absence or
presence of a signal at it\'s receiver:
  * UE should be transmitting at a sufficiently high power to allow for > the SS to detect its absence.
  * When the UE switches to the secondary or diversity antenna, there is > no connection with the SS receiver.
## 10.3 Beamforming Transmit Diversity
_Provide new UE core Tx requirements for the practical algorithm(s) considered
in this study for beamforming transmit diversity. New requirements will be
defined to ensure the UE with beamforming transmit diversity will not cause
any detrimental effects to overall system performance._
# 11 Analysis of UE Battery Life and Heat Reduction Savings due to ULTD
In this section, an analysis of UE battery life and heat reduction savings due
to ULTD is provided. The analysis is performed based on two different
methodologies:
\- Method 1: In this method [72], [73], using the PA efficiency characteristic
and UE transmit power profiles (Voice and Data) as input, the UE battery life
savings and heat reduction was obtained as a function of different UE transmit
power reduction values. The analysis, based on this method was performed for
both SATD and BFTD.
\- Method 2: In this method [74], using the PA efficiency characteristic as
input, the average UE battery life savings is computed, based on the
probability distribution of the UE transmit powers as observed in a system
simulation when ULTD is enabled. The analysis, based on this method was
performed only for SATD.
## 11.1 Method 1
### 11.1.1 PA Efficiency Curves
Figure 37 shows the efficiency characteristic of a PA with dynamic voltage
scaling used in the analysis. As seen in the figure, the efficiency ranges
from \~0 % to 40 % as the UE transmit power varies from -8 dBm to 24 dBm. A 40
% efficiency at a PA transmit power of 24 dBm results in an output power of
630 mW and 945 mW is transformed into heat. Figures 38 and 39 show the
efficiency characteristic of a full-power PA and a half-power PA with 3 gain
states respectively [72]. It should be noted that different UE manufacturers
tend to use different PA:s and that the conclusions thus might change
depending on which of the PA characteristics used. As can be seen the
efficiency for a PA employing dynamic voltage scaling is significantly higher
at medium to high output powers. Hence it is reasonable to expect that data-
centric devices primarily would employ PA:s based on dynamic voltage scaling.
For SATD, one full-power PA will be assumed. For BFTD two architectures are
studied. In the first one full-power PA for the primary transmit chain and one
half-power PA for the secondary transmit chain will be assumed and in the
second two half-power PAs are assumed. It should however be mentioned that an
architecture with two half-power PAs may not be viable since it is likely to
degrade the PRACH performance.

### 11.1.2 UE Transmit Power Profiles
In the analysis performed in Method 1, two UE transmit power profiles were
used:
\- The CDG35 user transmit power profile derived in [70] and plotted in figure
40.
\- A power profile captured from a live network from a single user with a
Rel-6 UE transmitting full buffer traffic from a single position (figure 41).
This profile is intended as one demonstrative example of UEs carrying out
HSUPA data transmission close to cell edge. It is recognized that the results
related with this power profile may not be used for drawing general
conclusions regarding potential power savings.

network deployment\ with a HSUPA Stationary Full-Buffer traffic model
### 11.1.3 UE Transmit Architecture Assumption for BFTD
Two PA architectures for the BFTD, shown in Figure 42 (using one full-power
and one ½ power PA) and figure 43 (using two ½ power Pas) are analyzed. While
the BFTD UE with two ½ power PAs can operate more efficiently, it may degrade
PRACH performance., The BFTD UE with a full power PA ( and a ½ power PA) are
capable of working like a regular UE in the case BFTD is turned off.

degraded RACH\ performance and is less viable to use in practice
## 11.2 Method 2
When computing the PA-related battery savings due to SATD, the following
methodology was adopted:
\- A PA efficiency curve (figure 37) and a probability density function of the
UE transmit power are used as input parameters. The probability distribution
function of the UE transmit power (at the input to the antenna(s)) has been
collected via system simulations and it is dependent on the specific scenario
(inter-site distance, channel type, uplink transmit diversity algorithm,
etc.).
\- Based on the PA efficiency curve, we compute the power that is consumed by
the PA and the switch given a certain transmit power (figure 44). This
relationship can be expressed as
$p_{\text{input}} =
\frac{\text{10}^{L_{\text{insertion}}/\text{10}}}{\eta_{\text{eff}}}p_{\text{tx}}$
(1)
where $L_{\text{insertion}}$ is the insertion loss associated with the switch,
$\eta_{\text{eff}}$ is the PA efficiency, $p_{\text{input}}$ the power before
the switch and $p_{\text{tx}}$the UE transmit power.
\- Given the probability density function of the UE transmit power the
expected PA power consumption (before the switch) pinput can be computed. For
the sake of clarity, we highlight that this computation is performed in linear
domain.
Using the above described 3-step approach the expected power consumed by the
different algorithms for different loads and channel types can be readily
obtained. All the results are presented as a function of the insertion loss
due to the switch.

## 11.3 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
### 11.3.1 UE Battery Life Analysis based on Method 1 for SATD [73]
In this analysis, the battery savings was computed relative to the baseline
where power consumption due to the modem subsystems of the UE was accounted
for:
\- Baseband processing.
\- RF processing on both transmit and receiver paths.
\- PA operation using dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) or average power tracking
(APT).
Note that the analysis does not include all the power consumptions in the
phone, e.g. the display panel etc. The reduction in heat was computed
specifically for the power amplifier alone and did not account for the heat
dissipated in other parts of the phone. Once the power consumption of these
components is included, the relative gain/loss due to using SATD may be less
significant depending on the UE transmit power.
For switched-antenna transmit diversity, reduction in current consumption
related to the PA and heat reduction was computed for an average transmit
power reduction of 0.5 dB, 1 dB and 1.5 dB as observed in the system
evaluation of SATD. Section 7.3 contains a more detailed description of the
transmit power reduction that can be realized in system simulations and we
highlight that the Tx power reductions were sensitive to channel type.. In
practice the potential battery savings (or losses) will therefore be dependent
on whether a UE with the power profile shown in Figure x5 will observe a PA3
channel or whether it is more likely to see a VA30 channel. The insertion loss
is assumed to be 0.3 dB [71].Typically, the insertion loss for off the shelf
switch components will vary between 0.3 dB and about 0.8 dB [102], [103]. Heat
reduction was measured as a dB ratio between the wasted powers (mW dissipated
in the PA towards heat) for the case when there is a transmit power reduction
to the baseline case (no transmit power reduction).
Table 87 summarizes the reduction in current consumption related to the PA
observed due to a reduction in UE transmit power by SATD (0.5 dB, 1 dB and 1.5
dB) for both the CDG35 and HSUPA Data transmit power profiles. It should be
noted that while the CDG35 profile was derived from a large sampling of many
networks, the HSUPA data profile was based on collected data from a single
user operating in a single static position of the cell. It should be noted
that results derived from the HSUPA power profile in this study are only
intended to be one demonstrative example of UEs carrying out uplink data
transmission at close to cell edge. It should be recognized that other UE
population may experience a different Tx power profile during HSUPA data
transmission. Furthermore the expected relative current saving may be lower
once the power consumption of other components such as the screen is taken
into account.
Table 88 summarizes the average heat reduction at close to maximum Tx power (≥
20 dBm) observed due to a reduction in UE transmit power by SATD. A uniform Tx
power distribution profile is used as an approximation in this high Tx power
region of ≥ 20 dBm. For the heat reduction, similarly results are derived
based on the HSUPA power profile.

### 11.3.2 UE Battery Life Analysis based on Method 2 for SATD [74]
This section presents the UE battery savings related to the switched transmit
antenna diversity based on Method 2. The probability density functions of the
UE transmit power have been collected via full buffer system simulations.
Throughout these simulations a noise rise threshold of 8 dB has been assumed
and no additional demodulation error due to antenna switching has been
accounted for. The simulation parameters used when collecting the UE transmit
power statistics are shown in table 3 in section 5.3.2.
Figure 45 shows the relative power saving associated with the practical
switched antenna diversity algorithm as a function of the insertion loss. From
the figure, one can observe that employing the algorithm saves power in
situations where the switch does not have any insertion loss. However, when
the insertion loss for the switch is accounted for it is clear that switched
antenna diversity in general will consume more power (as compared to the
baseline case without switched antenna diversity).[^3]

Figure 46 shows the relative power saving associated with the practical
switched antenna diversity algorithm for a VA30 channel. From the figure it
can be observed that switched transmit antenna diversity will result in that
the UE consumes more power (as compared to the reference case without transmit
diversity) if the insertion loss exceeds 0.2 dB. For insertion losses in the
range of 0.3 dB to 0.8 dB the relative increase in battery consumption will
amount to between 2.5 % and 17.5 %.

## 11.4 Beamforming Transmit Diversity
### 11.4.1 UE Battery Life Analysis based on Method 1 for BFTD [73]
For beam forming transmit diversity, the battery reduction related to the PA
and heat reduction was computed for an average transmit power reduction of 1
dB and 2 dB as observed in the system evaluation of BFTD. Here it is
noteworthy that the Tx power reduction was sensitive to the channel type
evaluated. Section 7.3 contains a detailed description of the gains that can
be realized in system simulations . The BFTD UE is assumed to employ a full-
power PA for its primary transmit chain and a half-power PA for its diversity
transmit chain. Heat reduction was measured as a dB ratio between the wasted
powers (mW dissipated in the PA towards heat) for the case when there is a
transmit power reduction to the baseline case (no transmit power reduction).
Table 89 summarizes the average battery power savings observed due to a
reduction in UE transmit power by BFTD (1 dB, 2 dB ) for both the CDG35 and
HSUPA Data transmit power profiles.
Table 90 summarizes the average heat reduction at close to maximum Tx power (≥
20 dBm) observed due to a reduction in UE transmit power by BFTD. A uniform
distribution profile is used as a reasonable approximation in this high Tx
power region of ≥ 20 dBm. For the heat reduction, similarly results are
derived based on the HSUPA power profile.

### 11.4.2 UE Battery Life Analysis based on Method 1 for BFTD [72]
The analysis of UE power amplifier and battery power saving due to the TX
power reduction is based on the following:
\- Two UE transmit power profiles:
  * CDG35-voice as shown in figure 40; and
  * HSUPA Data as shown in figure 41.
\- Two PA architectures:
  * one full power PA and one ½-power PA as shown in figure 42; and
  * dual ½-power PAs as shown in figure 43.
\- BFTD will be used when UE Pout > 0 dBm only.
It should be highlighted that the results presented here is based on a PA
architecture that employs three gain states. As noted previously it can be
expected that data centric devices, which are the ones that will require high
transmit powers, will utilize a PA architecture based on dynamic voltage
scaling. For this architecture the reduction in PA power consumption will be
significantly lower; as seen in table 89.
Table 91 summarizes the average PA power saving, due to a reduction in UE
transmit power (1 dB, 2 dB and 3 dB) for both the CDG35 and HSUPA users
transmit power profiles.

include UE\'s other circuitry (i.e. baseband, transceiver, display average up
to 590 mW, not including the PA) in the calculation. Note that a 20 % duty
cycle usage pattern is assumed for a high-resolution 750 mW display, while the

# 12 Impacts to NodeB Receiver due to ULTD
In this chapter two different practical NodeB receivers have been studied. The
re descriptions and results related to section 12.1 are related to the first
NodeB receiver and the results in section 12.2 are related to the second NodeB
receiver.
## 12.1 Results for practical Node B #1
### 12.1.1 Practical NodeB Receiver Description
In this study, we evaluate the impact of both Switched Antenna Transmit
Diversity (SATD) and Beamforming Transmit Diversity (BFTD) on a practical
NodeB receiver which includes a practical implementation of:
\- DCH searcher and associated finger management techniques (12.1.1).
\- Channel estimation and time tracking loop (12.1.2).
#### 12.1.1.1 DCH Searcher and Finger Management
A DCH searcher of non-coherent accumulation length of 16 slots with search
period of 18 slots (12 ms) and 150 slots (100 ms) was implemented. Both Pilot
and control symbols was used for energy accumulation within a DPCCH slot. DCH
searcher threshold was determined such that per chipx2 offset the false alarm
probability is equal to 0.1 %.
For assigned fingers, a finger management algorithm along with time tracking
loop (TTL) performs tasks such as finger assignment, finger offset tracking,
finger SNR monitoring, finger de-assignment, etc.
The simulation assumptions used are a subset of the assumptions in section
5.1. This simulation was conducted using 2 ms TTI with a TBS of 2020\.
Additionally, the Tx and Rx antenna correlations were assumed to be 0. UE DTX
was also turned off. The channel estimation applied was non-causal 4-slot
channel estimation with weights [0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1] (the effective averaging
length is 3 slots).
Additional parameters used in the simulation are summarized in table 93.

#### 12.1.1.2 Practical Channel Estimation and Time Tracking Loop
A practical channel estimation algorithm was assumed in this study. The
channel estimator is a 4-slot non-causal FIR filter with coefficients [h[n+1]
h[n] h[n-1] h[n-2]] = [0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1] .In addition, a time tracking loop
(TTL) is enabled in this simulation. The initial finger offsets are set to be
in accordance with the channel delay profile. However, the fingers locations
change over the duration of the simulation according to the TTL.
The simulation assumptions used are a subset of the assumptions in section
5.1. This simulation was conducted using 2 ms TTI with a TBS of 2020\.
Additionally, the Tx and Rx antenna correlations were assumed to be 0. UE DTX
was also turned off.
Table 94 shows the channel delay profile and the initial finger assignments
for the PA3 channel. The number of fingers assigned corresponds to the output
of a practical searcher operating on a PA3 channel as observed in section

### 12.1.2 Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity
#### 12.1.2.1 DCH Finger and Finger Management
The practical SATD algorithm used in the evaluation is described in section
4.3.1. The gains obtained were due to the application of SATD at the UE in the
presence of the practical NodeB implementation.
#### 12.1.2.1.1 Link Simulation Results
The following metrics are used in the performance evaluation of the algorithm:
\- Rx Ecp/No Gain = Rx Ecp/No NoTD - Rx Ecp/No SATD.
\- Tx Ecp/No Gain = Tx Ecp/No NoTD - Tx Ecp/No SATD.
The baseline is the case where the UE uses a single transmit antenna and not
apply any transmit diversity algorithms. Table 95 shows the link simulation
results with tx correlation 0, where antenna imbalance is the relative power
of the secondary antenna with respect to the first antenna.

Table 96 shows the finger miss detection probability comparison with 0 dB
antenna imbalance and 0 Tx antenna correlation. The miss detection probability
for a path (of a particular chipx2 peak offset) is defined as the probability
when searcher fails to accumulate energy above the searcher threshold.

#### 12.1.2.2 Practical Channel Estimation and Time Tracking Loop
##### 12.1.2.2.1 Link Simulation Results
Table 97 shows the average set point comparisons for the baseline and
practical algorithms. The average set point is computed over the duration of
the simulation.

It can be seen from table 97 that the difference in the average set point is
\ ${\hat{h}}_{i}^{4\text{slot}}$ is the channel estimate for the
> $i^{\text{th}}$Rx antenna. There are two receive antennas in the simulation
> and so, $i = 1,2$.
>
> $h_{i}$is the actual channel at the input to Rx antenna $i$
The channel estimate is a 4-slot non-causal channel estimate with weights [0.4
0.3 0.2 0.1]. Note that the effective averaging length is 3 slots.
The channel model used in the simulation is the modified Pedestrian A channel.
Therefore, a component of the channel power (FURP) is not recovered at the
receiver but is a component of the actual channel. When beamforming is applied
at the UE, the actual channel and the estimated channel correspond to the
composite channel after the application of the beamforming weights.
Figures 60 and 61 show the variation of the NMSE of the channel estimate for
beamforming and the baseline for Rx antennas 1 and 2.

It can be seen from figures 60 and 61 that, as expected, the channel
estimation quality improves as the Ecp/No at the receiver increases. However,
it is also seen that the NMSE in channel estimate is worse than the baseline
for the range of Ecp/No values. This is due to the induced fluctuations in the
channel on a per slot basis by the beamforming algorithm. Since the channel
fluctuates every slot due to the beamforming weights, the application of a
multiple-slot non-causal channel estimation algorithm would cause
deterioration in the channel estimate. Consequently, a higher Rx Ec/No would
be required in order to maintain the same channel estimation quality needed to
maintain a residual BLER of 1 %. This would therefore cause the increase in
the average set point as seen above in figure 61. However, it is considered
that the increase in the Rx Ec/No due to BFTD is not significant enough to
cause impact at the NodeB receiver.
## 12.2 Results for practical Node-B #2
The impact of Switched Antenna Transmit Diversity (SATD) on a practical NodeB
receiver is assessed using the practical SATD algorithm described in section
4.3.1. It is assumed that the UE applies a given practical SATD algorithm
independently of NodeB (i.e. without informing NodeB) and there are no
modifications of practical NodeB receiver algorithms.
The simulation assumptions used for open loop (OL) switched antenna transmit
diversity are a subset of assumptions in section 5.1. This simulation was
conducted using 2 ms TTI with a TBS of 2020 without outer loop power control.
Additionally, the antenna imbalance was assumed to be 0 dB and the Tx and Rx
antenna correlations were assumed to be 0. UE DTX was also turned off.
The relative Rx Ec/No gain values for different channel propagation
environments are tabulated in table 102. Note that a negative value
corresponds to that more power needs to be received at the Node-B.

# 13 Summary of RAN WG4 Findings
A summary of the RAN WG4 findings on the practical aspects of the ULTD
techniques is as follows:
\- Performance associated with bursty traffic resulting in state transitions:
  * The effect of varying burst sizes and inter-burst time as well the > impact of UE state transitions from IDLE to CELL_DCH on ULTD were > captured in these simulations for practical ULTD algorithms as > described in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.
\- In terms of average burst rate gain:
  * SATD offers an average burst rate gain ranging from 2 % to 8 % in a > PA3 channel setting. For VA30 channel, the gain in average user > burst rate ranges from 1 % up to 5 %.
  * BFTD offers up to 7 % gain in average user burst rate in a PA3 > channel setting. For VA30 channel, no substantial improvement or > degradation in terms of average user burst rate is observed.
\- In terms of 10^th^ percentile user burst rate:
  * SATD offers up to 31 % improvement for PA3 channel and up to 16 % > improvement for VA30 channel, thereby improving cell-edge user > experience.
  * BFTD offers up to 40 % improvement for PA3 channel and up to 14 % > improvement for VA30 channel, thereby improving cell-edge user > experience.
\- Demodulation losses due to studied uplink transmit diversity techniques:
  * It was acknowledged that these techniques can impact NodeB receiver > performance. For the ULTD algorithms simulated, assuming practical > NodeB receivers, the impact to NodeB receiver performance was > difficult to conclude on, due to the fact that some results were > attributed to the particular ULTD algorithms and the NodeB > receiver used in simulations. For the practical SATD algorithm > studied in the report, some results with a realistic NodeB > implementation suggested that up to 0.65 dB (or \~16 %) more power > would need to be received at the NodeB to obtain the same quality. > For a sub-optimal BFTD algorithm studied in this report, using the > same practical NodeB receiver, a significant impact (up to 2.6 dB > or 81 %) on received power was observed. On the other hand, for > other ULTD algorithms that were evaluated assuming a different > NodeB receiver, it was observed that the impact to the DPCCH > set‑point was observed to be \ BFTD for the commonly agreed simulation assumptions. Hence the > impact to NodeB receiver performance can be concluded to depend on > the ULTD algorithm and the practical NodeB receiver. However, no > consensus regarding the amount of typical demodulation losses for > SATD or BFTD was reached since the details of one of the NodeB > receivers could not be disclosed.
  * It was also shown that the BFTD algorithm is very sensitive to the > mismatch in TPC delay assumed by the UE compared to the actual TPC > delay introduced by the NodeB. Although, potential algorithms can > be devised at the UE to try estimate the TPC delay, the > feasibility of testing whether a UE was estimating the correct TPC > delay or not is not clear. In particular, due to the lack of a > reference NodeB power control implementation in the test setup, it > was not clear how best to emulate the TPC bit generation that > could happen in a practical NodeB receiver.
\- For both transmit diversity schemes (i.e. BFTD and SATD) a negative Rx
Ec/N0 was observed in different propagation conditions, i.e. the Rx Ec/N0 was
increased in the presence of open loop transmit diversity.
\- Effects from mixes of different uplink Tx diversity algorithms and/or
legacy UEs:
  * Some results have shown that with different penetration levels, > ranging from 25 % to 75 %, there are minor throughput and Tx-power > gains for TX diversity users but at the same time some > configurations can have impact on the performance experienced by > non-TX diversity UEs. The degradation to non‑TX diversity UEs was > especially clear at larger ISD, when the non-TXD users are power > limited. The simulations were performed assuming that all the Tx > Diversity UEs were applying the same algorithms. The impact on the > system performance when a mix of different ULTD algorithms were > used by the UEs in the system, was not studied.
  * However, in another set of results, where UL was RoT limited rather > than power limited (lower ISD), it was observed that when partial > introduction of Tx Diversity enabled UEs is done, the gains were > similar to the 100 % penetration case. At the same time, small > gains were observed for the legacy UEs.
  * One possible explanation to the difference in results is that > different schedulers have been assumed.
\- System impact of ULTD in high velocity propagation conditions:
  * A study was performed for both SATD and BFTD for the VA120 km/hr > propagation channel. A substantial loss was observed in terms of > mean user throughput and mean cell throughput when the long-term > antenna imbalance is -4 dB. Furthermore, the reduction in UE > transmit power was very small for the cases considered. It was > proposed by two companies that in order to prevent the negative > impact on the system performance in certain radio environments the > possibility should exist for the network to control the ULTD > operation. It was also pointed out that such control could exist > in the ULTD algorithm itself that relies on a coarse estimate of > the UE speed. It was on the other hand argued by another company > that autonomous control of the ULTD diversity is less favourable > to allow, because of the risk for system degradation due to the > network not having control of the UE behaviour and due to large > inaccuracies involved in speed estimation especially when DRX/DTX > is used.
  * In order to prevent the negative impact on the system performance in > certain radio environments we clearly see the benefit of having > the possibility for the network to control the SATD operation.
\- Performance of suboptimal ULTD algorithms:
  * In a study for the PA3 km/hr, the performance of a suboptimal SATD > algorithm was evaluated. This was modelled by letting the UE take > a random decision for a certain part of the radio frames. It was > observed that the performance degradation was dependent on the > level of randomized behaviour of the UE algorithm and performance > degrades also for algorithms that are only slightly imperfect. > This indicates that the system performance may be sensitive to > what type of ULTD algorithm that the UE is utilizing.
\- Interaction with DC-HSUPA:
  * The co-existence of open loop transmit diversity with DC-HSUPA has > not been studied.
\- UE battery and heat savings
  * UE battery and heat savings analysis was performed using two > different methodologies that assumed practical PA efficiency > curves.
\- One methodology was based on using two UE transmit power profiles 1) due to
the CDG35 user transmit power profile; and 2) due to HSUPA traffic from a UE
located at one fixed stationary position at cell-edge in a live network. Each
of these UE transmit power profiles were then used along with the PA
efficiency curve to evaluate the potential gains in UE battery and heat
consumption for a range of transmit power reductions of the same order as
observed in the link and system study for both SATD and BFTD. Using this
methodology, for a 2 dB reduction in transmit power, BFTD offered up to \~18%
savings in PA power consumption while for a 1.5 dB reduction in UE average
transmit power, SATD offered up to \~8 % savings in PA power consumption. In
practice the size of the gain will be highly dependent on the average
reduction in Tx power and it should be noted that for the VA30 channel the
observed gains were in general closer to 1 dB for BFTD and 0.5 dB for SATD. It
should also be noted that the study focused on a specific PA design and that
the end results might differ when other PA designs are considered.
\- Another methodology was based on evaluating the battery life gains of SATD
in a system simulation. The simulation did consider the power consumption only
in the PA. The simulation did not assume any additional demodulation losses
(in case such demodulation losses occur this could result in a smaller gain in
PA power consumption). It assumed a long-term antenna imbalance of 0 dB for
the second transmit antenna, an ideal path searcher, and accounted for an
insertion loss introduced by the RF switch. Based on an insertion loss of 0.8
dB, the analysis was shown to demonstrate an increase in average power
consumption by the PA with up to 17.5 % for the VA30 channel. For a more
optimistic insertion loss of 0.3 dB, the increase was in the order of 4 %. For
the PA3 channel model the study showed results ranging from a reduction in PA
power consumption of 2.5 % to an increase in PA power consumption of 8 %, as
the insertion loss increased from 0.3 dB to 0.8 dB. It should be noted that
the PA power will dominate in the UE power consumption when the UE transmits
at close to maximum transmit power.
\- PRACH coverage impact due to BFTD:
  * One of the candidate UE architectures was discussed which allowed > the UE to use a full power PA in Idle or CELL_FACH state thereby > ensuring that the PRACH coverage remained unaltered. The same UE > when transmitting in CELL_DCH was shown to operate in two > half-power PA mode, when BFTD is enabled using the technique of > dynamic voltage scaling. Hence it was concluded that using such a > UE architecture, enabling BFTD in the UE in CELL_DCH could have > no impact on UL PRACH coverage. However, to guarantee that the UL > PRACH coverage is not degraded it would be necessary to ensure > that BFTD UEs only transmit from one antenna (thus at least one > full power PA would always be needed).
\- Impacts on UE implementation:
  * Impacts to UE implementation were identified. Besides the > introduction of control logic to support the ULTD algorithms, it > was identified that additional duplexer, and an additional > transmit antenna would be required at the UE for both SATD and > BFTD. In addition for SATD, a RF switch would be required to > support the antenna switching operation while for BFTD, a second > power amplifier (PA) would be required. Some of these components > would need to be specific for the frequency band on which UL TXD > is supported. For SATD, it was also noted that unless the > specification allows for a maximum power reduction to mitigate the > effect of additional insertion loss due to the switch, the PA size > would need to be increased.
\- Impact on existing UE core requirements:
  * The impact analysis on UE Tx core requirements due to SATD was > discussed. In particular, it was argued by one company that since > the UE architecture for SATD uses the same transmit chain as for > the case when SATD is disabled, there is no impact to all but 1 of > the Tx core requirements. In particular, due to the presence of an > RF switch, if the PA design used in existing architectures is not > modified, it is expected that some relaxation may be beneficial > with regard to the UE maximum output power requirement (6.2.1 in > 25.101). In situations where SATD is not enabled this may reduce > uplink coverage for these UEs (the magnitude will be dependent on > the size of the relaxation). Furthermore due to the existence of a > second duplexer and a second antenna, it was considered necessary > that the UE be manually configured to transmit on the second > antenna and test for 1) UE maximum output power, 2) Spurious > Emissions (6.6.3) and Error Vector Magnitude (6.8.2).
  * With regard to UE Rx core requirements, it was suggested that there > may be a need to test the receiver performance against existing > requirements by manually configuring the UE to transmit on each > antenna separately so as to capture the impact of the Tx/Rx > isolation due to each of the duplexers.
\- Introduction of new core Tx requirements:
  * It was discussed whether it would be possible to devise sufficient > test coverage for UEs employing open loop transmit diversity, > since there are no specifications detailing the UE behavior. It > was argued by some companies that the requirements should focus on > a few selected architectures, while other companies argued that no > specific architecture could be assumed when devising the test > because of the lack of specification on UE behavior. It was > discussed whether the tests could employ an initialization phase > that would identify specific UE architectures and adapt the > testing accordingly, no consensus was however reached on whether > this would be feasible.
  * For SATD, the following new core Tx requirements were proposed by > the proponents of the architecture specific test approach :
\- A limit on the antenna switching rate to ensure minimal impact to NodeB
receiver performance. Further work would be needed to determine suitable TPC
bit patterns to ensure that the UE does not exceed this limit.
\- In addition to a switching rate limit, the need for additional TX core
requirements to ensure minimal impact to node B receiver was discussed but not
concluded.
\- It was also pointed out by a few companies that further study may be needed
during any possible work item to evaluate if there is a need to specify a
requirement on the power emitted by the unused antenna port thereby limiting
the amount of leakage introduced by the switch from the active transmit path.
  * The need for additional TX requirements to ensure the gains of TX > diversity were realized was discussed, but the feasibility of such > requirements was not concluded.
# 14 Conclusion
# 14.1 Conclusions specific to open loop transmit diversity
A link and system study was carried out by RAN WG1 to investigate UL Tx
diversity techniques for HSPA under the constraint that no new standardised
dynamic feedback signalling would be required between network and UE. In
particular, both forms of transmit diversity, 1) switched antenna Tx diversity
(simultaneous transmission from 1 transmit antenna) and 2) beamforming
(simultaneous transmission from 2 Tx antennas) were thoroughly investigated.
In general potential gains (or losses) from ULTD in terms of throughput and
power saving varied between scenarios and companies. One potential explanation
for the latter was that different companies assume different Node‑B
schedulers. For slow fading propagation conditions some gains for the average
and 10th percentile user throughputs for the TX-diversity users were noticed.
In other scenarios (fast fading, negative long term antenna imbalance),
smaller gains or some losses were also observed. A detailed conclusion on the
system evaluation of these techniques and the set of assumptions on which the
results rely can be found in section 7.3.
RAN WG4 further discussed the practical aspects of these techniques. In
general, there were agreements on a few topics including 1) impact on UE
implementation, 2) partial agreement on impact on existing core requirements
such as the need for relaxing the UE maximum output power requirement, 3)
bursty traffic system performance under the assumption that there would be no
additional Node-B demodulation losses,4) System performance degradation due to
incorrect TPC delay It was considered that the UE modifications to support
ULTD operation were feasible. It was also argued by one company that the
difficulty to devise appropriate test-cases might induce a risk for system
performance degradation... It was also acknowledged that some relaxation would
be required with regard to the UE maximum output power requirement for SATD
operation in order to overcome the additional transmit chain insertion loss
due to the added circuitry associated with the feature.. Finally, it was
agreed that incorrect estimate of delays corresponding to TPC commands at the
UE causes negative impacts to open loop beamforming.
However, it was difficult to arrive at a consensus on the following topics:
\- NodeB Demodulation losses associated with various possible algorithms.
\- Effects from mixes of different uplink Tx diversity algorithms and/or
legacy UEs.
\- Feasibility of testing of new core Tx requirements.
\- Feasibility of testing TPC delay correctness.
\- UE battery power and heat savings.
More details on the RAN WG4 findings can be found in section 13.
Based on the study performed here, it is considered that the UL Transmit
Diversity techniques for HSPA can help improve the uplink coverage for TX-
diversity users in some scenarios, while marginally improving system
performance with large penetration of TX-diversity capable UE\'s.. It should
be noted that there were some potential system performance concerns raised
under some conditions (eg. sub-optimal transmit diversity algorithms, high
velocity propagation conditions along with zero antenna correlation and
negative long term antenna imbalance) due to implications to non-TX-diversity
users performance, and due to impact on the legacy Node B performance. For
this purpose, it was recommended that higher layer signaling to enable/disable
the uplink transmit diversity transmission should be considered as a possible
method to mitigate some of these concerns, although it has not been evaluated
whether such signaling can be effectively used in a dynamic manner. It should
also be noted that the co‑existence of open loop uplink transmit diversity
with DC-HSUPA has not been studied.
## 14.2 Conclusions specific to closed loop transmit diversity
### 14.2.1 Link Evaluation Results
#### 14.2.1.1 UL CLTD pilot schemes
The following metrics are used in the performance evaluation of the algorithm:
\- Rx Ec/No Gain = Rx Ec/No NoTD - Rx Ec/No CLTD_BF.
\- Tx Ec/No Gain = Tx Ec/No NoTD - Tx Ec/No CLTD_BF.
The baseline is the case where the UE uses a single transmit antenna and not
apply any transmit diversity algorithms.

### 14.2.2 System Evaluation Results
A system level evaluation of the performance associated with closed loop
transmit diversity where the Node-B controls the pre-coding vector that a UE
applies has also been carried out by RAN1 under the uplink transmit diversity
WI. The results are summarized in [124] and they are based on the ones
presented in [104]-[123] for closed loop uplink transmit diversity. Except
from the assumptions specific for closed transmit diversity the used
simulation parameters are similar to those used when evaluating open loop
transmit diversity techniques (see sub-clause 5.3.2).
The simulation results presented in [124] and summarized below for different
receiver types, antenna models and site-to-site distances show that closed
loop transmit diversity can provide substantial performance gains - both in
terms of reduced transmit power, increased cell capacity, and cell-edge
performance. Largest gains are observed for slow, non-dispersive channel and
as the delay spread and/or the Doppler of the channel increases the gains
reduce.
