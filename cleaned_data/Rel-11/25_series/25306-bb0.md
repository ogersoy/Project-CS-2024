# 4 UE radio access capability parameters
In the following the UE radio capability parameters are defined. When using
the RRC configuration parameters, UTRAN needs to respect the UE capabilities.
Only parameters for which there is a need to set different values for
different UEs are considered as UE capability parameters. Therefore, the
capabilities that are the same for all UEs, including baseline capabilities,
are not listed here.
UTRAN needs to respect the UE capabilities when configuring the RBs. Actions
in the UE when capabilities are in conflict with a UTRAN request are specified
in RRC.
## 4.1 PDCP parameters

controls that the UE capability can be fulfilled through the following
parameters:
1\. MAX_HEADER;
2\. TCP_SPACE;
3\. NON_TCP_SPACE;
The context space for a single RFC 2507 protocol entity calculates from:
(2 * (TCP_SPACE + 1 + NON_ TCP_SPACE + 1) * MAX_HEADER).

size across all RLC AM entities supported by the UE. When HS-DSCH is
configured this is defined as the maximum total buffer size across all MAC-hs
reordering entities and all RLC AM entities supported by the UE. The memory
signalled in this capability is dynamically shared by RLC AM entities and MAC-
hs reordering entities at any time.
In order to evaluate memory consumption in the UE, it shall be assumed that:
  * a stored AMD PDU of N octets requires a memory equal to N octets;
  * a stored MAC-hs PDU of N bits requires a memory equal to (N -- 10) bits.

### 4.5.1 Transport channel parameters in downlink
##### Maximum sum of number of bits of all transport blocks being received at
an arbitrary time instant {#maximum-sum-of-number-of-bits-of-all-transport-
blocks-being-received-at-an-arbitrary-time-instant .H6}
NOTE 1: \"Being received\" refers to all bits in the active TFC within the
TFCS over all simultaneous transport channels received by the UE. \"Arbitrary
time instant\" means that the time instant corresponding to the highest sum of
number of bits is relevant. This note also applies to similar parameter
definitions below.
This parameter is defined as:
Σ~i~(N~i~)
where N~i~ is defined as the number of bits in transport block #i, and the sum
is over all transport blocks being received at an arbitrary time instant. All
transport blocks that are to be simultaneously received by the UE on DCH,
FACH, PCH and DSCH transport channels are included in the parameter.
NOTE 2: A UE does not need to support a TFC within the TFCS for which the sum
of _Number of Transport Blocks_ * _Transport Block size_ over all simultaneous
transport channels is larger than what the UE capability indicates.
This UE capability also limits the maximum number of bits before de-rate-
matching as follows: The maximum number of bits before de-rate matching being
received at an arbitrary time instant (DPCH, PDSCH, S-CCPCH) shall be less or
equal to 6.6 times the Maximum sum of number of bits of all transport blocks
being received at an arbitrary time instant.

blocks being received at an arbitrary time instant. {#maximum-sum-of-number-
of-bits-of-all-convolutionally-coded-transport-blocks-being-received-at-an-
arbitrary-time-instant. .H6}
This parameter is defined similar to the parameter above, but the sum includes
only transport blocks that are to be convolutionally coded.
##### Maximum sum of number of bits of all turbo coded transport blocks being
received at an arbitrary time instant. {#maximum-sum-of-number-of-bits-of-all-
turbo-coded-transport-blocks-being-received-at-an-arbitrary-time-instant. .H6}
This parameter is defined similar to the parameter above, but the sum includes
only transport blocks that are to be turbo coded.
##### Maximum number of simultaneous transport channels {#maximum-number-of-
simultaneous-transport-channels .H6}
This is defined as the maximum number of downlink Transport Channels that the
UE is capable to process simultaneously, not taking into account the rate of
each Transport Channel.
NOTE: The number of simultaneous transport channels affects how the total
memory space and processing capacity can be shared among the transport
channels. A UE does not need to support more simultaneous transport channels
than the UE capability allows for.
##### Maximum number of simultaneous CCTrCH {#maximum-number-of-simultaneous-
cctrch .H6}
This is defined as the maximum number of downlink CCTrCH that the UE is
capable to process simultaneously. CCTrCH should be interpreted as consisting
of DCH, FACH or DSCH.
##### Maximum total number of transport blocks received within TTIs that end
within the same 10 ms interval {#maximum-total-number-of-transport-blocks-
received-within-ttis-that-end-within-the-same-10-ms-interval .H6}
All transport blocks that are to be simultaneously received by the UE on DCH,
FACH, PCH and DSCH transport channels are included in the parameter.
NOTE: Relates to processing requirements for CRC in downlink. A UE does not
need to support a TFC within the TFCS for which the sum of _Number of
Transport Blocks_ is larger than what the UE capability indicates. In the case
of several CCTrCHs, the combination of the TFCs within the respective TFCSs
for simultaneous TTIs at an arbitrary time instant shall not exceed this
parameter.
##### Maximum number of TFC {#maximum-number-of-tfc .H6}
Defines the maximum number of transport format combinations the UE can store,
where all transport format combinations for all downlink transport format
combination sets are counted. Different channelisation code mapping shall be
counted as separate TFC in case of DSCH.
##### Maximum number of TF {#maximum-number-of-tf .H6}
The maximum total number of downlink transport formats the UE can store, where
all transport formats for all downlink transport channels are counted.
##### Support for turbo decoding {#support-for-turbo-decoding .H6}

HS-DSCH TTI {#maximum-number-of-bits-of-an-hs-dsch-transport-block-received-
within-an-hs-dsch-tti .H6}
Defines the maximum number of bits of an HS-DSCH transport block received
within an HS-DSCH TTI the UE is capable of receiving within a HS-DSCH TTI.
### 4.5.2 Transport channel parameters in uplink
##### Maximum sum of number of bits of all transport blocks being transmitted
at an arbitrary time instant {#maximum-sum-of-number-of-bits-of-all-transport-
blocks-being-transmitted-at-an-arbitrary-time-instant .H6}
NOTE 1: \"Being transmitted\" refers to all bits in the active TFC within the
TFCS over all simultaneous transport channels transmitted by the UE.
\"Arbitrary time instant\" means that the time instant corresponding to the
highest sum of number of bits is relevant. This note also applies to similar
parameter definitions below.
This parameter is defined as:
Σ~i~(N~i~)
where N~i~ is defined as the number of bits in transport block #i, and the sum
is over all transport blocks being transmitted at an arbitrary time instant.
NOTE 2: This parameter is related to memory requirements for uplink data
received from MAC before it can be transmitted over the radio interface. As
shown in Figure 4.1 the worst case occurs for the maximum TTI. A UE does not
need to support a TFC within the TFCS for which the sum of _Number of
Transport Blocks_ * _Transport Block size_ over all simultaneous transport
channels is larger than what the UE capability indicates.
##### Maximum sum of number of bits of all convolutionally coded transport
blocks being transmitted at an arbitrary time instant {#maximum-sum-of-number-
of-bits-of-all-convolutionally-coded-transport-blocks-being-transmitted-at-an-
arbitrary-time-instant .H6}
This parameter is defined similar to the parameter above, but the sum includes
only transport blocks that are to be convolutionally coded.
##### Maximum sum of number of bits of all turbo coded transport blocks being
transmitted at an arbitrary time instant {#maximum-sum-of-number-of-bits-of-
all-turbo-coded-transport-blocks-being-transmitted-at-an-arbitrary-time-
instant .H6}
This parameter is defined similar to the parameter above, but the sum includes
only transport blocks that are to be turbo coded.
##### Maximum number of simultaneous transport channels {#maximum-number-of-
simultaneous-transport-channels-1 .H6}
This is defined as the maximum number of uplink transport channels that the UE
is capable to process simultaneously, not taking into account the rate of each
transport channel.
NOTE: A UE does not need to support a TFC within the TFCS for which the sum of
_Number of Transport Blocks_ * _Transport Block size_ over all simultaneous
transport channels is larger than what the UE capability indicates.
##### Maximum number of simultaneous CCTrCH {#maximum-number-of-simultaneous-
cctrch-1 .H6}
This parameter is applicable for TDD only. For FDD there is always only one
CCTrCH at a time. The parameter is defined as the maximum number of uplink
CCTrCH that the UE is capable to process simultaneously.
##### Maximum total number of transport blocks transmitted within TTIs that
start at the same time {#maximum-total-number-of-transport-blocks-transmitted-
within-ttis-that-start-at-the-same-time .H6}
Defines the maximum number of transport blocks that the UE is capable to
transmit within TTIs that start at the same time. An example is shown in
figure 4.1.
NOTE: Relates to processing requirements for CRC in uplink.
##### Maximum number of TFC {#maximum-number-of-tfc-1 .H6}

## 4.13 UE minimum capabilities for reception of MBMS not provided in MBSFN
mode
For FDD, the minimum UE capability for MBMS reception for MBMS services that
are not provided in MBSFN mode consists of two separate and independent parts
(\"MBMS capability part A\" and \"MBMS capability part B\").
MBMS capability part A parameters defined in Table 4.13-1 are the same as the
64kbps UE reference class for DL described in subclause 5.2 and provides
capability to enable reception of logical channels other than MTCHs and MSCH
when MBMS PTM is received simultaneously.
Table 4.13-1: MBMS capability part A (FDD)

NOTE: Capability for reception of DPCH is applicable only if UE supports MBMS
PTM reception in CELL_DCH state for reception of MBMS services that are not
provided in MBSFN mode.
MBMS capability part B for reception of MBMS services that are not provided in
MBSFN mode is defined in the following Table 4.13-2. MBMS capability part B
enables reception of the S-CCPCHs onto which at least MTCH is multiplexed.
MBMS capability part B supports selection combining and soft combining of
S-CCPCHs on different cells. The UE is not required to support simultaneous
selection combining and soft combining.
The exhaustive lists of supported configurations (slot formats, TTI and
combining parameters) for capability part B is given in Table 4.13-3. Only
FACH can be mapped on the S-CCPCHs listed in table 4.13-3. In addition to
MTCH, the MSCH, BCCH, CCCH, DCCH and DTCH can be multiplexed onto the S-CCPCHs
listed in table 4.13-3. The FACH TTI restrictions in table 4.13-3 only apply
to FACHs carrying MTCH or MSCH.

NOTE: \'None\' indicates that either selection combining or soft combining is
not required for the respective combination.
Since MBMS capability part A and B are independent, the maximum total number
of S-CCPCHs, including the S-CCPCH that the UE is required to monitor by
subclause 8.5.19 of [12], that the UE is required to receive is 4.
MBMS Capability part B may be used to receive MCCH in the following cases:
  * When the UE is in CELL_FACH state, and the MCCH is on a different S-CCPCH than the S-CCPCH that the UE is required to monitor by subclause 8.5.19 of [12].
  * When the UE is in CELL_DCH, if the UE supports MBMS PTM reception in CELL_DCH.
Furthermore, in case MBMS PTM reception is ongoing, the UE may soft or
selectively combine one less cell than shown in table 4.13-3 while receiving
the S-CCPCH carrying the MCCH.
Further restrictions on the supported configurations of the S-CCPCH carrying
the MCCH apply. The exhaustive lists of supported slot formats, TTI size, and
maximum number of configured transport channels that can be received, depend
on the capability of the UE to support MBMS PTM reception in CELL_DCH. Table
4.13-3a applies when UE does support MBMS PTM reception in CELL_DCH, while
Table 4.13-3b applies when UE does not support MBMS PTM reception in CELL_DCH.
In addition to MCCH, the BCCH, PCCH, CCCH, DCCH and DTCH can be multiplexed
onto the S-CCPCHs listed in tables 4.13-3a and 4.13-3b. The FACH TTI
restrictions in tables 4.13-3a and 4.13-3b only apply to FACH carrying MCCH.

## 4.13a UE minimum capabilities for reception of MBMS provided in MBSFN mode
For FDD, the minimum UE capability for reception of MBMS on cells that are
operating in MBSFN mode consists of two separate and independent parts (\"MBMS
capability part C\" and \"MBMS capability part D\").
For FDD MBSFN capability part C parameters defined in Table 4.13a-1 are the
same as the 64kbps UE reference class for DL described in subclause 5.2 and

For FDD, MBSFNcapability part D for cells that do operate in MBSFN mode is
defined in Table 4.13a-2 for the reception of MTCH and MSCH on a S-CCPCH. This
allows the UE to receive at least one service sent on a S-CCPCH of a cell
operating in MBSFN mode.
The exhaustive lists of supported configurations (slot formats and TTI) for

For MBSFN Integrated Mobile Broadcast (3.84 Mcps TDD IMB), the minimum UE
capability for reception of MBMS on cells that are operating in MBSFN mode
consists of two separate and independent parts (\"MBMS capability part E\" and
\"MBMS capability part F\").
For 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB, capability part E parameters defined in Table
4.13a-8 enable reception of MCCH on S-CCPCH frame type 1 when MBMS PTM is
received simultaneously, and is applicable when a cell is operating in MBSFN
mode.

For any category, in addition to the requirements in Table 5.1a, an HS-SCCH
less capable UE shall allocate 24960 raw channel bits for HS-SCCH less
operation in order to buffer the last 13 subframes and 13599 soft channel bits
to receive 3 parallel HARQ processes.
UE Categories 1 to 4 and Category 11 do not support HS-DSCH reception in
CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH states.
UEs of Category 13 are only required to support code rates up to 0.823 when
64QAM is used, which is represented by a limitation in the maximum value of
_K~i~_. in the transport block calculation in [9]. For other modulation
formats, this restriction does not apply.
UEs of Category 15 are only required to support code rates up to 0.823 for
16QAM when two transport blocks are received in the same TTI, which is
represented by a limitation in the maximum value of _K~i~_ in the transport
block calculation in [9]. For other modulation formats or when a single
transport block is received, this restriction does not apply.
UEs of Category 19 are only required to support code rates up to 0.823 when
64QAM is used when two transport blocks are received in the same TTI, which is
represented by a limitation in the maximum value of _K~i~_. in the transport
block calculation in [9]. For other modulation formats or when a single
transport block is received, this restriction does not apply.
UEs of Category 21 are only required to support code rates up to 0.823 when
16QAM is used, which is represented by a limitation in the maximum value of
_K~i~_. in the transport block calculation in [9]. For other modulation
formats, this restriction does not apply.
UEs of Category 23 are only required to support code rates up to 0.823 when
64QAM is used, which is represented by a limitation in the maximum value of
_K~i~_. in the transport block calculation in [9]. For other modulation
formats, this restriction does not apply.
UEs of category 25 are only required to support code rates up to 0.823 for
16QAM for one cell when two transport blocks are received in the same TTI on
that cell, which is represented by a limitation in the maximum value of Ki in
the transport block calculation. For other modulation formats or when a single
transport block is received in a cell, this restriction does not apply on that
cell.
UEs of category 27 are only required to support code rates up to 0.823 for
64QAM for one cell when two transport blocks are received in the same TTI on
that cell, which is represented by a limitation in the maximum value of Ki in
the transport block calculation. For other modulation formats or when a single
transport block is received in a cell, this restriction does not apply on that
cell.
A UE that supports categories greater or equal to category 13, also supports
E-DPDCH.
A UE that supports categories greater or equal to category 13, also supports
MAC-ehs.
NOTE 1: Depending on the HS-DSCH configuration, the indicated maximum number
of bits of an HS-DSCH transport block does not have to correspond exactly to
an entry in the transport block size table to be applied [9].
NOTE 2: A UE of category 17 supports the physical capabilities of categories
13 and 15, but not simultaneously. The first row of category 17 in table 5.1a
specifies the capabilities when MIMO is not configured and the capabilities of
category 13 apply, the second row specifies the capabilities when MIMO is
configured and the capabilities of category 15 apply.
NOTE 3: A UE of category 18 supports the physical capabilities of categories
14 and 16, but not simultaneously. The first row of category 18 in table 5.1a
specifies the capabilities when MIMO is not configured and the capabilities of
category 14 apply, the second row specifies the capabilities when MIMO is
configured and the capabilities of category 16 apply.

## 5.2 Reference UE radio access capability combinations
Based on required UE radio access capabilities to support reference RABs as
defined in [2], this clause lists reference UE Radio Access capability
combinations. Subclause 5.2.1 defines reference combinations of UE radio
access capability parameters common for UL and DL. Subclauses 5.2.2 and 5.2.3
define reference combinations of UE radio access capability parameters that
are separate for DL and UL respectively. A reference combination for common UL
and DL parameters, one combination for UL parameters and one combination for
DL parameters together relate to a UE with a certain implementation
complexity, that allows support for one or several combined reference RABs.
Combinations for UL and DL can be chosen independently. The bit rate supported
by the selected combination of common UL and DL parameters needs to be at
least as high as the maximum out of the supported bit rates of the selected
combination of DL parameters and the selected combination of UL parameters.
Different combinations have different levels of implementation complexity.
For defined reference RABs, it is possible to require a UE to meet a certain
reference UE radio access capability combination. Each UE needs to have
capabilities complying with a given reference radio access capability
combination. Each individual radio access capability parameter as defined in
subclause 5.1 shall be signalled.
The reference combination numbers shall not be used in the signalling of UE
radio access capabilities between the UE and UTRAN. Reference UE radio access
capability combinations provide default configurations that should be used as
a basis for conformance testing against reference RABs.
The UE shall support at least the UE radio access capability parameter values
as specified for the 12kbps UE reference class for both UL and DL.
Allowed values of UE capability parameters are limited by the defined range
and granularity of values in subclause 5.1. Values might change depending on
further definition of reference RABs for testing.
### 5.2.1 Combinations of common UE Radio Access Parameters for UL and DL
NOTE: Measurement-related capabilities are not included in the combinations.
These capabilities are independent from the supported RABs.
