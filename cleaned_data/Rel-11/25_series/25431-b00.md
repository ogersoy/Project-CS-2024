where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the standards allowed to implement Layer 1 on
the Iub interface.
The specification of transmission delay requirements and O&M requirements is
not in the scope of this document.
In the following 'Layer 1' and 'Physical Layer' are assumed to be synonymous.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 25.411 [1] apply.
# 4 Iub Layer 1
The Iub Layer 1 shall comply with the requirements of chapter 4 in TS 25.411
[1].
In addition, for the Iub Layer 1, it shall be possible to use n 64 kbit/s time
slots within the scope of \"ATM on Fractional E1/T1\" as specified in ATM
Forum AF-PHY-0130.00 [2], and to allow the co-existence of this interface with
other interfaces on the same physical medium.
