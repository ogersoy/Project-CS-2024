# 4 General
As agreed in the WI proposal [1]:
The DCH demodulation performance requirements under single-cell scenario for
TDD were introduced in Release 4. However, there is a lack of performance
requirements for 1.28Mcps TDD under multi-cell scenario, which may be
different from single-cell scenario due to the interference from intra-
frequency cells. According to the real network deployment, multi-cell
scenarios are considered more realistic since UE in cell border is easy to be
influenced by the interference from intra-frequency cells. Thus it is
necessary to define the demodulation performance requirements for UE under
multi-cell scenario, which will also indicate the capability of overcoming
intra-frequency interference.
The objective of this WI is to specify performance requirements for multi-cell
scenarios in RAN4 specifications including the following parts:
a. Performance in static propagation (AWGN) conditions
\- Define the demodulation performance requirements with intra-frequency
interference in static propagation (AWGN) conditions
b. Performance in multi-path fading propagation conditions
\- Define the demodulation performance requirements with intra-frequency
interference in multi-path fading propagation conditions
The scope of this work item is limited to 1.28Mcps LCR TDD.
# 5 Simulation Scenarios
## 5.1 Static Propagation Conditions
The purpose of this scenario is to verify UE demodulation performance in
static propagation condition. In this scenario, both 12.2 kbps and 64 kbps
services are considered. For each service, the total number of DPCHo
Channelization Codes from neighbouring cells is 4, 12 and 28, which stands for
low, medium, high network load respectively. For 12.2 kbps, verification point
is 1% BLER, and for 64 kbps, verification point is 10% BLER.
The test cases for static propagation condition are defined in Table 5.1-1.
More detailed information is referred to 6.3 and 6.4 for DCH parameters and
reference receiver structure.

## 5.2 Fading Propagation Conditions
### 5.2.1 Multi-path fading Case 1
The purpose of this scenario is to verify UE demodulation performance in Case
1 fading propagation condition. It is similar to static propagation condition

propagation model is Multi-path fading Case 1.
The test cases for case 1 propagation condition are defined in Table 5.2.1-1.

### 5.2.2 Multi-path fading Case 3
The purpose of this scenario is to verify UE demodulation performance in Case
3 fading propagation condition. It is similar to static propagation condition
since the simulation scenarios approximate to ones in clause 5.1 except the
propagation model is Multi-path fading Case 3.
The test cases for case 3 propagation condition are defined in Table 5.2.2-1.
