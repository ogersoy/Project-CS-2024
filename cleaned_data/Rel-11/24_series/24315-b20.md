# 4 Operator Determined Barring Service Description
The network feature Operator Determined Barring (ODB) as specified 3GPP TS
22.041 [11] and in this specification allows a network operator or service
provider to regulate access to IM CN subsystem services, by the barring of
certain categories of incoming or outgoing communications, the barring of
certain categories of roaming and the barring of certain categories of
supplementary services configuration and invocation. When barring of an
incoming or outgoing category of communications is configured all in progress
communications belonging to that category are released.
The SIP related procedures for support of ODB of Communication Barring are
realized in an Application Server (AS) as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2], which
depending on the use case, is to be provided on the originating side or the
terminating side.
The SIP related procedures for support of ODB of the SIP based configuration
of a supplementary service, as defined in 3GPP TS 24.238 [8], are realized by
the AS which provides the function of SIP based configuration for that
supplementary service.
The XCAP related procedures for support of ODB of the XCAP based configuration
of a supplementary service, as defined in 3GPP TS 24.623 [9], are realized by
the AS which provides the function of XCAP based configuration for that
supplementary service.
ODB based barring is applied to a subscription by administrative action in the
HSS. In order to get the information about the ODB settings for a subscriber
an AS can subscribe to notification on such changes via Sh interface as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.329 [12]. The HSS contains the ODB categories that
apply to the subscriber. The URIs for premium numbers for entertainment, the
URIs for premium numbers for information and the conditions for operator
specific categories are locally configured in the AS providing the ODB
services. It shall be possible for the operator to use patterns and regular
expression to configure the URIs for premium numbers in the AS.
ODB categories cannot be configured by the user.
# 5 Barring of Communication
## 5.1 Barring of outgoing Communication
### 5.1.1 General
Barring of outgoing communication is invoked in the AS performing ODB service.
Barring of outgoing communication includes one of the following categories:
\- barring outgoing communication;
\- barring outgoing international communications;
\- barring outgoing international communications except those directed to the
home PLMN country; or
\- barring of outgoing communications when roaming outside the home PLMN
country;
and one or more of the following categories:
\- barring of outgoing Premium Rate Communications (Information);
\- barring of outgoing Premium Rate Communications (Entertainment);
\- barring of outgoing Premium Rate Communications (Information) when roaming
outside the home PLMN country; or
\- barring of outgoing Premium Rate Communications (Entertainment) when
roaming outside the home PLMN country.
and one or more of the following categories:
\- when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 1);
\- when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 2);
\- when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 3); or
\- when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 4).
Editor's Note: Blocking of Premium Rate Communications for roaming subscriber
requires further study.
Barring of outgoing communications does not apply to emergency communications.
### 5.1.2 Procedures in the Application Server
The AS providing the ODB service shall operate as a routeing B2BUA as
specified in subclause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]. An AS providing the ODB
service and rejecting a request shall operate as a terminating UA, as
specified in subclause 5.7.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
On reception of an initial SIP INVITE request or SIP MESSAGE request initiated
by the UE, which contain in the Request-URI neither a service URN with a top-
level service type of \"sos\" as specified in RFC 5031 [16] nor a number
recognized as an emergency number based on local configuration, an AS
providing the ODB service needs to determine whether ODB is applied to the SIP
request. In order to do so the AS providing the ODB service shall:
1) identify the served user as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] for
communication initiated by the UE;
2) determine whether the subscription profile for the served user contains ODB
categories as listed in subclause 5.1.1; and
3) use the rules defined in subclause 5.1.3 to determine whether any of the
categories apply to the communication.
When a barring category applies to a communication, the AS shall, based on
operator local policy, either:
1) reject the SIP request, and send an indication to the originating UE by
sending a SIP 603 (Decline) response. In addition, based on configuration
prior to terminate the communication the AS can provide an announcement to the
originating user. The procedure of invoking an announcement is described
within 3GPP TS 24.628 [6]; or
2) forward the SIP request to a pre-configured destination using normal SIP
procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
When a new barring category is set for a user, the AS providing the ODB shall
determine whether the category applies to any communication of the served user
using the rules defined in subclause 5.1.3. When a barring category applies to
a communication, the AS providing ODB shall:
1) if two dialogs have been established, then simultaneously send a SIP BYE
request for both dialogs managed by the AS, as specified in subclause 5.7.5.3
of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]; or
2) if a communication is currently being established, then simultaneously send
a SIP 603 (Decline) response to the served user and a SIP CANCEL request
towards the called user, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
NOTE: In order to get the information about the ODB settings for a subscriber
an AS subscribes to notification on such changes via Sh interface as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.329 [12].
### 5.1.3 Determining whether a category applies to a communication
In order to determine whether an ODB category applies for a communication the
following applies:
1) outgoing communication: this evaluates to true for all outgoing
communication.
2) outgoing international communications: this evaluates to true when the
request URI of the outgoing SIP request:
a) corresponds to a telephone number, i.e. a SIP URI with a \"user\" URI
parameter set to \"phone\" or a tel URI; and
b) does not point to a destination served by a network within the country
where the originating user is located when initiating the call.
3) outgoing international communications except those directed to the home
PLMN country: this evaluates to true when the request URI of the outgoing SIP
request:
a) corresponds to a telephone number, i.e. a SIP URI with a \"user\" URI
parameter set to \"phone\" or a tel URI;
b) does not point to a destination served by a network within the country
where the originating user is located when initiating the call; and
c) does not point to a destination served within the served users home
network.
4) outgoing communications when roaming outside the home PLMN country: this
evaluates to true when the served user is registered from an access network
other than the served user home network and when the access network is outside
the home PLMN country.
NOTE: Whether the served user is registered from another network then the
served users home network can be determined from the P-Visited-Network-ID
header field specified in IETF RFC 7315 [17] and the P-Access-Network-Info
header field specified in IETF RFC 7315 [17]. Both are provided during the
registration process, see 3GPP TS 24.229 [2], subclause 5.7.1.3.
5) outgoing Premium Rate Communications (Information): this evaluates to true
when the canonical form of the request URI of the outgoing SIP request matches
an entry in the locally configured list of URIs for premium rate
communications for information.
6) outgoing Premium Rate Communications (Entertainment): this evaluates to
true when the when the canonical form of request URI of the outgoing SIP
request matches an entry in the locally configured list of URIs for premium
rate communications for entertainment.
7) outgoing Premium Rate Communications (Information) when roaming outside the
home PLMN country: this evaluates to true when
a) the canonical form of the request URI of the outgoing SIP request matches
an entry in the locally configured list of URIs for premium rate
communications for information; and
b) the served user is registered from an access network other than the served
user home network and when the access network is outside the home PLMN
country.
8) outgoing Premium Rate Communications (Entertainment) when roaming outside
the home PLMN country: this evaluates to true when
a) the canonical form of the request URI of the outgoing SIP request matches
an entry in the locally configured list of URIs for premium rate
communications for entertainment; and
b) the served user is registered from an access network other than the served
user home network and when the access network is outside the home PLMN
country.
9) when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 1): this
evaluates to true when the request matches the locally configured conditions
for operator specific barring type 1.
10) when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 2): this
evaluates to true when the request matches the locally configured conditions
for operator specific barring type 2.
11) when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 3): this
evaluates to true when the request matches the locally configured conditions
for operator specific barring type 3.
12) when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 4): this
evaluates to true when the request matches the locally configured conditions
for operator specific barring type 4.
The Operator specific barring definition for type 1, type 2, type 3, and type
4 is locally configured in the AS providing the ODB service. For operator
specific barring the criteria that can be used by the operator to define
conditions that are used to determine whether the category applies may be
based on any signalling information from the incoming request. Examples of
such criteria are:
1) destination type e.g. international numbers or specific numbers;
2) media used in the communication, e.g. audio, video, or text.
When any of the items 1) to 12) evaluates to true then the ODB category
applies for a communication.
## 5.2 Barring of incoming Communication
Barring of incoming communication is invoked in the AS performing the ODB
service.
Barring of incoming communication includes one of the following categories:
\- barring incoming communications;
\- barring incoming communications when roaming outside the home PLMN country;
and one or more of the following categories:
\- when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 1);
\- when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 2);
\- when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 3);
\- when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 4).
### 5.2.2 Procedures in the Application Server
The AS providing the ODB service shall operate as a routeing B2BUA, as
specified in subclause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]. An AS providing the ODB
service and rejecting a request shall operate as a terminating UA, as
specified in subclause 5.7.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
On reception of an initial SIP INVITE request or SIP MESSAGE request
terminated at the UE an AS providing the ODB service needs to determine
whether the SIP request is rejected due to ODB. In order to do so the AS
providing the ODB service shall:
1) identify the served user as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] for terminating
communication; and
2) determine whether the subscription profile for the served user contains ODB
categories as listed in subclause 5.2.1; and
3) use the rules in subclause 5.2.3 to determine whether any of the categories
apply to the communication.
When a barring category applies to a communication, the AS shall, based on
operator local policy, either:
1) reject the SIP request, and send an indication to the originating UE by
sending a SIP 603 (Decline) response. In addition, based on configuration
prior to terminate the communication the AS can provide an announcement to the
originating user. The procedure of invoking an announcement is described
within 3GPP TS 24.628 [6]; or
2) forward the SIP request to a pre-configured destination using normal SIP
procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
When a new barring category is set for a user, the AS providing the ODB shall
determine whether the category applies to any communication of the served user
using the rules defined in subclause 5.2.3. When a barring category applies to
a communication, the AS providing ODB shall:
1) if two dialogs have been established, then send simultaneously a SIP BYE
request for both dialogs managed by the AS as specified in subclause 5.7.5.3
of 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]; or
2) if a communication is currently being established, then simultaneously send
a SIP 603 (Decline) response to the served user and a SIP CANCEL request
towards the called user, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2].
NOTE: In order to get the information about the ODB settings for a subscriber
an AS subscribes to notification on such changes via Sh interface as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.329 [12].
### 5.2.3 Determining whether a category applies to a communication
When determining whether an ODB category applies for a communication the
following applies:
1) incoming communication: this evaluates to true for all incoming requests.
2) incoming communications when roaming outside the home PLMN country: this
evaluates to true when the served user is registered from an access network
other than the served user home network and when the access network is outside
the home PLMN country.
3) when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 1): this
evaluates to true when the request matches the locally configured conditions
for operator specific barring type 1.
4) when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 2): this
evaluates to true when the request matches the locally configured conditions
for operator specific barring type 2.
5) when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 3): this
evaluates to true when the request matches the locally configured conditions
for operator specific barring type 3.
6) when registered in the HPLMN, Operator Specific Barring (Type 4): this
evaluates to true when the request matches the locally configured conditions
for operator specific barring type 4.
The Operator specific barring definition for type 1, type 2, type 3, and type
4 is locally configured in the AS providing the ODB service. For operator
specific barring the criteria that can be used by the operator to define
conditions that are used to determine whether the category applies may be
based on any signalling information from the incoming request. Examples of
such criteria are:
1) origination information e.g. specific numbers;
2) media used in the communication, e.g. audio, video, or text.
When any of the items 1) to 6) evaluates to true then the ODB category applies
for a communication.
# 6 Barring of Roaming
### 6.1 General
Barring of roaming as specified in 3GPP TS 22.041 [11]. Technical realization
is outside the scope of the current specification.
NOTE: Barring of roaming is performed at IMS registration as defined in 3GPP
TS 29.228 [13] and 3GPP TS 23.228 [14].
# 7 Barring of Supplementary Services Configuration and Invocation
## 7.1 Barring of Management of supplementary service settings and invocation
### 7.1.1 General
Barring of supplementary services access is invoked in the AS that provides
the supplementary service and include management of settings of a
supplementary service and user invocation of supplementary services.
Barring of Supplementary Services Access includes the following category:
\- Barring of supplementary services management.
NOTE: Supplementary services management can utilize mechanisms such as web-
based provisioning which are not standardized in 3GPP. Application of ODB to
such mechanisms is out of the scope of this specification.
### 7.1.2 XCAP Procedures in the Application Server
When an AS that provides an XCAP based interface for configuration of a
supplementary service as described in 3GPP TS 24.623 [9], and supporting ODB
receives an XCAP request it needs to determine whether the XCAP request is to
be rejected due to ODB. In order to do so, the AS shall:
1) identify the served user as specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 [9]; and
2) determine whether the subscription profile for the served user contains the
ODB category for barring of supplementary services configuration access.
When the AS decides to reject the XCAP request, the AS shall send a HTTP 403
(Decline) response.
### 7.1.3 SIP Procedures for service configuration in the Application Server
When an AS that provides a SIP based interface for configuration of a
supplementary service, and supporting ODB receives an INVITE SIP request for
service configuration set as specified in 3GPP TS 24.238 [8], it needs to
determine whether the SIP request is to be rejected due to ODB. In order to do
so, the AS shall:
1) identify the served user as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]; and
2) determine whether the subscription profile for the served user contains the
ODB category for barring of supplementary services configuration access.
When the AS decides to reject the SIP request, the AS shall send an indication
to the originating UE by sending a SIP 603 (Decline) response.
### 7.1.4 Barring of user invocation of supplementary service
Except for the barring of the invocation of certain kinds of communication
transfer described in subclause 7.3, the barring of user invocation of
supplementary services is out of the scope of this specification.
NOTE: The Barring of invocation of a supplementary service can be achieved
through the deactivation of the subscription of the user to that service. ODB
cannot apply to a supplemantary service that is not subject to user
subscription (i.e. the service is provided to all users).
## 7.2 Barring of manipulation of communication diversion settings
### 7.2.1 General
Barring of manipulation of communication diversion settings is provided in an
AS that provides the communication diversion services as described in 3GPP TS
24.604 [10].
Barring of manipulation of communication diversion comprises the following
categories:
\- Barring of registration of any communication diverted-to address;
\- Barring of registration of any international communication diverted-to
address;
\- Barring of registration of any international communication diverted-to
address except to an address within the HPLMN country.
When determining whether an ODB category applies for a request for setting the
registration of a communication diversion, following applies:
1) registration of any communication diverted-to address: this evaluates to
true for all registrations for a communication diversion.
2) registration of any international communication diverted-to address: this
evaluates to true when the diverted-to address:
a) corresponds to a telephone number, i.e. a SIP URI with a \"user\" URI
parameter set to \"phone\" or a tel URI; and
b) does not point to a destination served by a network within the country
where the originating user is located when initiating the call.
3) registration of any international communication diverted-to address except
to an address within the HPLMN country: this evaluates to true when the
diverted-to address
a) corresponds to a telephone number, i.e. a SIP URI with a \"user\" URI
parameter set to \"phone\" or a tel URI;
b) does not point to a destination served by a network within the country
where the originating user is located when initiating the call; and
c) does not point to a destination served within the served users home
network.
When a barring category for communication diversion registration is set all
the previously registered communication diversions that overlap with this
category shall be deactivated.
### 7.2.2 XCAP Procedures in the Application Server
When an AS that provides an XCAP based interface for configuration of
communication diversion as described in 3GPP TS 24.238 [8] and 3GPP TS 24.604
[10], and supporting ODB receives an XCAP request it needs to determine
whether the XCAP request is to be rejected due to ODB. In order to do so, the
AS shall:
1) identify the served user as specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 [9]; and
2) determine whether the subscription profile for the served user contains ODB
categories as listed in subclause 7.2.1 and whether these categories apply to
the received XCAP request.
When the AS decides to reject the XCAP request, the AS shall send a HTTP 403
(Decline) response.
### 7.2.3 SIP Procedures in the Application Server
When an AS that provides a SIP based interface for configuration of
communication diversion as described in 3GPP TS 24.604 [10] and supporting ODB
receives a SIP request it needs to determine whether the SIP request is to be
rejected due to ODB. In order to do so, the AS shall:
1) identify the served user as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]; and
2) determine whether the subscription profile for the served user contains ODB
categories as listed in subclause 7.2.1 and whether these categories apply to
the received SIP request.
When the AS decides to reject the SIP request, the AS shall send an indication
to the originating UE by sending a SIP 603 (Decline) response.
## 7.3 Barring of invocation of call transfer
### 7.3.1 General
Barring of invocation of communication transfer is provided in an AS serving
that provides the explicit communication transfer service as described in 3GPP
TS 24.629 [15].
Barring of invocation of communication transfer includes one of the following
categories:
\- Barring of invocation of communication transfer;
\- Barring of invocation of communication transfer where at least one of the
two communications is a communication charged to the served subscriber; i.e.
the communication is either an outgoing communication or an incoming
communication when the served subscriber roams outside the HPLMN;
\- Barring of invocation of communication transfer where at least one of the
two communications is a communication charged to the served subscriber at
international rates, i.e. the communication is either an outgoing
international communication or an incoming communication when the served
subscriber roams outside the HPLMN country;
and one of the following categories:
\- Barring of invocation of communication transfer where both communications
are communications charged to the served subscriber, i.e. both communications
are either outgoing communications or incoming communications when the served
subscriber roams outside the HPLMN;
and one of the following categories:
\- Barring of further invocation of communication transfer if there is already
one ongoing transferred communication for the served subscriber.
### 7.3.2 SIP Procedures in the Application Server
When an AS that provides the explicit communication transfer service as
described in 3GPP TS 24.629 [15], and supporting ODB receives a SIP REFER
request for initiating a Call Transfer as defined 3GPP TS 24.629 [15] it needs
to determine whether the SIP REFER request is to be rejected due to ODB. In
order to do so, the AS shall:
1) identify the served user as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]; and
2) determine whether the subscription profile for the served user contains ODB
categories as listed in subclause 7.3.1 and whether these categories apply to
the received SIP REFER request.
When the AS decides to reject the SIP REFER request, the AS shall send an
indication to the originating UE by sending a SIP 603 (Decline) response.
