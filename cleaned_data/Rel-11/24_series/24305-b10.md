# 1 Scope
The present document specifies a mobile device Selective Disabling of 3GPP UE
Capabilities (SDoUE) Management Object (MO) and the rules and corresponding
behaviour of the UE with regard to the selective disabling of 3GPP UE
capabilities, for example, when services or functions are disabled/enabled.
The SDoUE MO is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [8].
The SDoUE MO consists of the relevant parameters that can be managed for
selective disabling of 3GPP UE capabilities.
The SDoUE MO defines a repository of data into the ME.
The service requirements for selective disabling of 3GPP UE capabilities are
defined in 3GPP TS 22.011 [2].

# 4 Selective Disabling of 3GPP UE Capabilities Management Object
The Selective Disabling of 3GPP UE Capabilities (SDoUE) Management Object (MO)
is used to manage settings of the UE for remotely disabling selected UE
capabilities.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-sdoue:1.0.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism as standardized (see
Enabler Release Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [8]) may be used to grant or deny
access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and leaf objects of
the SDoUE MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the SDoUE node:

disabled.
When the GPRS_SM_PDP leaf value is set to \"1\", the UE shall initiate the
signalling procedure for PDP context deactivation of all PDP contexts (see
3GPP TS 24.008 [3]). Additionally, the UE shall not use mobile-originated GPRS
SM procedures for PDP contexts until the GPRS_SM_PDP leaf value is set to
\"0\". The UE is however allowed to use mobile-originated GPRS SM procedure
for PDP context activation in the following cases:
\- upon receipt of an OMA DM notification message indicating that the UE shall
initiate an OMA DM session to the OMA DM server that either had set the
disable value of the GPRS_SM_PDP leaf or is the one stored in the
AlertServerID leaf;
\- when the mobile-originated PDP context activation procedure is necessary in
order to either establish an emergency call over IMS (if the
IMS_EmergencyCalls value is set to \"0\") or send an OMA DM generic alert

however allowed to temporarily stop to use the traffic mapping information in
the following cases:
\- upon receipt of an OMA DM notification message indicating that the UE shall
initiate an OMA DM session to the OMA DM server that either had set the
disable value of the EPS_SM_EPS leaf or is the one stored in the AlertServerID
leaf;
\- when the UE wishes to either establish an emergency call over IMS (if the
IMS_EmergencyCalls value is set to \"0\") or send an OMA DM generic alert
message according to the sub-clause 5.17A.
Later, the UE shall initiate the signalling procedure for UE requested PDN
disconnection (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [7A]) of all PDNs but the one which was
established by the successful completion of the UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure.

stored in the Network leaf, if exists, in conjunction with the corresponding
Country node.
## 5.22 /_\ _/Ext
The Ext is an interior node for where the vendor specific information about
the SDoUE MO is being placed (vendor meaning application vendor, device vendor
etc.). Usually the vendor extension is identified by vendor specific name
under the ext node. The tree structure under the vendor identified is not
defined and can therefore include one or more un-standardized sub-trees.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get

###### ## Annex A (informative): Management Object DDF
This DDF is the standardized minimal set. A vendor can define it's own DDF for
the complete device. This DDF can include more features than this minimal
standardized version.
