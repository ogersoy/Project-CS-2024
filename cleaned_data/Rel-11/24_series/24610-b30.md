reception of media stream(s) of an established IP multimedia session, and
resume the media stream(s) at a later time.
## 4.3 Operational requirements
### 4.3.1 Provision/withdrawal
The HOLD service that includes announcements shall be provided after prior
arrangement with the service provider.
### 4.3.2 Requirements on the originating network side
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
### 4.3.3 Requirements in the network
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
### 4.3.4 Requirements on the terminating network side
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
## 4.4 Coding requirements
No specific coding requirements are needed.
## 4.5 Signalling requirements
### 4.5.1 Activation/deactivation
The HOLD service is activated at provisioning and deactivated at withdrawal.
4.5.1A Registration/erasure
The HOLD service requires no registration. Erasure is not applicable.
4.5.1B Interrogation
Interrogation of HOLD is not applicable.
### 4.5.2 Invocation and operation
#### 4.5.2.1 Actions at the invoking UE
In addition to the application of procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [1] ,
the following procedures shall be applied at the invoking UE in accordance
with RFC 3264 [4].
A UE shall not invoke the HOLD service on a dialog associated with an
emergency call the UE has initiated.
If individual media streams are affected, the invoking UE shall generate a new
SDP offer where:
\- for each media stream that is to be held, the SDP offer that contains:
\- an \"inactive\" SDP attribute if the stream was previously set to
\"recvonly\" media stream; or
\- a \"sendonly\" SDP attribute if the stream was previously set to
\"sendrecv\" media stream;
\- for each media stream that is to be resumed, the SDP offer contains:
\- a \"recvonly\" SDP attribute if the stream was previously an inactive media
stream; or
\- a \"sendrecv\" SDP attribute if the stream was previously a sendonly media
stream, or the attribute may be omitted, since sendrecv is the default; or
\- for each media stream that is unaffected, the media parameters in the SDP
offer remain unchanged from the previous SDP offer.
If all the media streams are to be held, the invoking UE shall generate an SDP
offer containing a session level direction attribute, or separate media level
direction attributes, in the SDP that is set to:
\- \"inactive\" if the streams were previously set to \"recvonly\" media
streams; or
\- \"sendonly\" if the streams were previously set to \"sendrecv\" media
streams; or
If all the media streams that shall be resumed, the invoking UE shall generate
a session level direction attribute, or separate media level direction
attributes, in the SDP that is set to:
\- \"recvonly\" if the streams were previously inactive media streams; or
\- \"sendrecv\" if the streams were previously sendonly media streams, or the
attribute may be omitted, since sendrecv is the default.
Then the UE shall send the generated SDP offer in a re-INVITE request (or
UPDATE request) to the remote UE.
#### 4.5.2.2 Void
#### 4.5.2.3 Void
#### 4.5.2.4 Actions at the AS of the invoking UE
As a network option, for each media stream marked \"recvonly\" in the SDP
answer sent to the invoking UE, the AS of the invoking UE shall lower the
bandwidth by setting the \"b=AS:\" parameter to a small value, e.g.
\"b=AS:0\". The \"b=RR:\" and \"b=RS:\" parameters shall be set to values
large enough to enable continuation of the RTCP flow, e.g. \"b=RR:800\" and
\"b=RS:800\".
As a network option, for each media stream marked \"inactive\" in the SDP
answer sent to the invoking UE, the AS of the invoking UE shall lower the
bandwidth by setting the \"b=AS:\" parameter to a small value, e.g.
\"b=AS:0\". The \"b=RR:\" and \"b=RS:\" parameters shall be set to values
large enough to enable continuation of the RTCP flow, e.g. \"b=RR:800\" and
\"b=RS:800\".
NOTE 1: A media stream in the SDP answer can be marked as \"recvonly\" at
media description level or/and at session description level (i.e. all the
media streams are marked \"recvonly\").
As a network option, the AS of the invoking UE shall initiate the procedures
for the provision of an announcement to the held user in accordance with 3GPP
TS 24.628 [6].
NOTE 2: Not providing an announcement allows the service provider to provide
the possibility to change from bidirectional to unidirectional media streams.
NOTE 3: A service provider can decide to provide announcements only if a pre-
defined set of media streams are put on HOLD.
#### 4.5.2.5 Void
#### 4.5.2.6 Void
#### 4.5.2.7 Void
#### 4.5.2.8 Void
#### 4.5.2.9 Actions at the held UE
3GPP TS 24.229 [1] shall apply.
## 4.6 Interaction with other services
### 4.6.1 Communication Hold (HOLD)
Not applicable.
### 4.6.2 Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.3 Terminating Identification Restriction (TIR)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.4 Originating Identification Presentation (OIP)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.5 Originating identification restriction (OIR)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.6 Conference calling (CONF)
If a participant of a conference invokes the HOLD service, it is not desirable
to provide an announcement to the conference. If the AS supporting the HOLD
supplementary service receives a re-INVITE (or UPDATE) request on a dialog for
which the \"isfocus\" feature parameter was included in the Contact header
from the remote end-point, the AS shall not initiate the procedures for the
provision of an announcement to the held user(s).
### 4.6.7 Communication DIVersion services (CDIV)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.8 Malicious Communication IDentification (MCID)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.9 Anonymous Communication Rejection and Communication Barring (ACR/CB)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
### 4.6.10 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)
No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.
## 4.7 Interactions with other networks

###### ## Annex A (informative): Signalling Flows
# A.1 HOLD communication
Assumption is that a session has been established between UE-A and UE-B using
basic communication procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [1], therefore the
following signalling flows do not apply to the initial INVITE.
## A.1.1 HOLD communication without announcement
The following diagram shows a communication session put on hold using a re-
INVITE request . The same can be achieved by sending an UPDATE request.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="4.346527777777778in"}
Figure A.1.1.1: HOLD communication without announcement to the held user
1\. UE-A sends a re- INVITE to UE-B to hold the session - see example in table
A.1.1.1-1. Hold is done by changing the SDP attribute. For each media stream
that shall be held:
\- \"a=sendonly\", if the stream was previously a sendrecv media stream;
\- \"a=inactive\", if the stream was previously a recvonly media stream.

# A.2 RESUME Communication
## A.2.1 RESUME communication without announcement
The following diagram shows how a communication session is resumed using a re-
INVITE request; The same can be achieved by sending an UPDATE request.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="4.346527777777778in"}
Figure A.2.1.1: RESUME communication without announcement to the held user
1\. UE-A sends an INVITE to UE-B to resume the session - see example in table
A.2.1.1-1. Resume is done by changing the SDP attribute. For each media stream
that shall be resumed:
\- \"a=sendrecv\", if the stream was previously a recvonly media stream, or
the attribute can be omitted, since sendrecv is the default;

## A.2.2 RESUME communication with announcement
The following diagram shows how a communication session is resumed using a re-
INVITE request after it was held with an announcement being played by the AS
to the held party. The same can be achieved by sending an UPDATE request.

Figure A.2.2.1: RESUME communication with announcement to the held user
1\. UE-A sends an INVITE to UE-B to resume the session - see example in table
A.2.2.1-1. Resume is done by changing the SDP attribute. For each media stream
that shall be resumed:
\- \"a=sendrecv\", if the stream was previously a recvonly media stream, or
the attribute can be omitted, since sendrecv is the default;
\- \"a=recvonly\", if the stream was previously an inactive media stream.
