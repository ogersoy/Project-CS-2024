# 1 Scope
The present document defines a protocol used for manipulating data related to
supplementary services. The protocol is based on the eXtensible Markup
Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) RFC 4825 [8]. A new XCAP
application usage is defined for the purpose of manipulating the supplementary
services data. The common XCAP related aspects that are applicable to
supplementary services are specified in the present document. The protocol
allows authorized users to manipulate service‑related data either when they
are connected to IMS or when they are connected to non‑IMS networks (e.g. the
public Internet).
The present document is applicable to User Equipment (UE) and Application
Servers (AS) which are intended to support XCAP application usage for
manipulating data related to supplementary services.

# 4 Architecture for manipulating supplementary services settings
The protocol described in the present document allows to manipulate settings
and variables related that influence the execution of one or more
supplementary services. Manipulation of the supplementary services take place
over the Ut interface (UE to AS), as shown in figure 1.
{width="2.25625in" height="1.1534722222222222in"}
Figure 1: Ut interface
Manipulation of supplementary services does not usually take place during
real‑time operation. Typically users manipulate their services configuration
data prior to the invocation and execution of the service.
Authentication of the user with HTTP may take place directly at the AS, such
as in figure 1, or with the support of an Authentication Proxy, such as in
figure 2. The architecture for authentication is provided in 3GPP TS 33.222
[6].
NOTE: The Network Application Function (NAF) can be an AS.

# 5 The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP)
## 5.1 Introduction
For the purpose of manipulating data stored in an application server the XML
Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [8] is used. XCAP allows a client to
read, write and modify application configuration data, stored in XML format on
a server. XCAP maps XML document sub‑trees and element attributes to HTTP
URIs, so that these components can be directly accessed by HTTP (see IETF RFC
2616 [1]). XCAP uses the HTTP methods PUT, GET, and DELETE to operating on XML
documents stored in the server.
In the case of supplementary services, the data stored in a server is related
to the execution of that given service. The present document defines a new
XCAP Application Usage for the purpose of allowing a client to manipulate data
related to supplementary services.
XCAP (see IETF RFC 4825 [8]) defines two logical roles: XCAP client and XCAP
servers. An XCAP client is an HTTP/1.1 compliant client. Similarly an XCAP
server is an HTTP/1.1 compliant server. The XCAP server acts as a repository
of XML documents that customize and modify the execution of the supplementary
services. Figure 3 depicts the XCAP architecture where an XCAP client sends an
HTTP/1.1 request to an XCAP server. The server replies with an HTTP/1.1
response.
{width="2.25625in" height="1.1534722222222222in"}
Figure 3: XCAP architecture
According to XCAP (see IETF RFC 4825 [8]), each application that makes use of
XCAP defines its own XCAP application usage. The present document defines an
supplementary services XCAP application usage in clause 6. This application
usage defines the XML schema W3C REC-xmlschema-1-20010502 [2] for the data
used by the application, along with other key pieces of information.
XCAP focuses on the definition of XML documents that are compliant with the
XML schema and constrains defined for a particular XCAP application usage.
XCAP allows application to provide XML documents that are common for all users
or XML documents that affect the service of a given user.
Central to XCAP is the construction of the HTTP URI that points to particular
XML document or certain components of it. A component in an XML document can
be an XML element, attribute, or the value of it.
## 5.2 Functional entities
### 5.2.1 User Equipment (UE)
#### 5.2.1.1 General
The UE implements the role of an XCAP client, as described in subclause 5.3.1
accessing the XCAP application usage as described in subclause 6.2.
For systems where Generic Authentication Architecture [6] is used, the UE
shall support the authentication mechanisms specified in 3GPP TS 33.222 [6]
and 3GPP TS 24.109 [5].
For systems where Generic Authentication Architecture [6] is not used, the UE
shall support RFC 2617 [3] and IETF RFC 2246 [4] according to ETSI TS 183 038
[12].
On sending an HTTP request, the UE may indicate the user\'s identity intended
to be used with the AS by adding a HTTP X‑3GPP‑Intended‑Identity header (3GPP
TS 24.109 [5]) to the outgoing HTTP request.
#### 5.2.1.2 Subscription for notification of state changes in XML document
In order to keep the supplementary services state synchronized with the
network elements and other terminals that the user might be using, the UE
should subscribe to changes in the XCAP simserv documents by generating a
SUBSCRIBE request in accordance with RFC 5875 [11].
### 5.2.2 Authentication Proxy (AP)
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
An Authentication Proxy is an HTTP/1.1 IETF RFC 2616 [1] compliant server
whose main purpose is to authenticate the user requests. The Authentication
Proxy is used to separate the authentication procedure and the Application
Server (AS) specific application logic to different logical entities.
The AP is configured as a HTTP reverse proxy, i.e. the FQDN of the AS is
configured to the AP such a way that the IP traffic intended to the AS is
directed to the AP by the network. The AP performs the authentication of the
UE. After the authentication procedure has been successfully completed, the AP
assumes the typical role of a reverse proxy, i.e. the AP forwards HTTP
requests originating from the UE to the correct AS, and returns the
corresponding HTTP responses from the AS to the originating UE.
The AP allows authorized users to manipulate services when they are connected
to an IMS network or when they are connected to a non‑IMS network (e.g. the
public Internet). Authentication details can differ in both situations.
Provisioning of credentials to authenticate the user is outside the scope of
the present document. 3GPP TS 33.222 [6] provides further architectural
authentication details.
#### 5.2.2.2 Authentication
#### 5.2.2.2.0 General
On receiving an HTTP request, the AP shall first determine the mechanism used
to authenticate the user. If the Generic Authentication Architecture [6] is
used, the AP shall attempt to authenticate the user via the mechanisms
specified in 3GPP TS 33.222 [6] and the AP shall follow the procedures
indicated in subclause 5.2.2.2.1. For systems where Generic Authentication
Architecture 3GPP TS 33.222 [6] is not used, the AP shall attempt to
authenticate the user according to IETF RFC 2617 [3] and ETSI TS 183 038 [12]
provides guidelines for the Authentication Proxy.
##### 5.2.2.2.1 Authentication based on the generic authentication
architecture
On receiving an HTTP request that contains the Authorization header field, the
AP shall:
a) use the value of that username parameter of the Authorization header field
to authenticate the user;
b) apply the procedures specified in IETF RFC 2617 [3] for authentication;
c) if the HTTP request contains an X‑3GPP‑Intended‑Identity header field (3GPP
TS 24.109 [5]), then the AP may verify that the user identity belongs to the
subscriber. This verification of the user identity shall be performed
dependant on the subscriber\'s application specific or AP specific user
security settings;
d) if authentication is successful, remove the Authorization header field from
the HTTP request;
e) insert an HTTP X‑3GPP‑Asserted‑Identity header field (3GPP TS 24.109 [5])
that contains the asserted identity or a list of identities; and
f) forward the HTTP request to the appropriate AS.
On receiving an HTTP response for the previous request, the AP shall:
a) add an Authentication‑Info header field in accordance to the procedures
described in 3GPP TS 33.222 [6]; and
```{=html}
``` g) forward the response to the XCAP client.
On receiving an HTTP request that does not contain the Authorization header
field, the AP shall:
a) challenge the user by generating a 401 Unauthorized response according to
the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 33.222 [6] and IETF RFC 2617 [3]; and
```{=html}
``` h) forward the 401 Unauthorized response to the sender of the HTTP
request.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Void
#### 5.2.2.3 Authorization
The AP shall be able to decide whether particular subscriber, i.e. the UE, is
authorized to access a particular AS. On doing so, the AP may use the User
Security Settings specified in 3GPP TS 24.109 [5].
The AP may indicate an asserted identity or a list of identities to the AS by
adding an HTTP X‑3GPP‑Asserted‑Identity header field to the HTTP requests
prior to forwarding the request to the AS. In case of multiple identities,
they shall be separated by comma (,) and each identity shall be surrounded by
quotation marks (\"). Whether the AP supports this handling of an asserted
identity or a list of identities then it shall depend on local policy in the
AP. In addition the subscriber\'s application specific or AP specific user
security settings may be considered.
The AP may indicate an authorization flag or a list of authorization flags
from the application specific user security settings (USS) to the AS by adding
a HTTP X‑3GPP‑Authorization‑Flags header field to the HTTP request prior to
forward it to the XCAP server. The HTTP X‑3GPP‑Authorization‑Flags header
field shall contain a list of authorization flags separated by comma (,) and
each authorization flag is surrounded by quotation marks (\"). In case the AP
supports this handling of authorization flags from USS then it shall depend on
local policy in the AP.
### 5.2.3 Application Server (AS)
#### 5.2.3.1 General
An Application Server implements the role of an XCAP server as described in
subclause 5.3.2 providing the XCAP application usage as described in subclause
6.2.
For systems where Generic Authentication Architecture [6] is used, the AS
shall support the authentication mechanisms specified in 3GPP TS 33.222 [6]
and 3GPP TS 24.109 [5].
For systems where Generic Authentication Architecture [6] is not used, the AS
shall support IETF RFC 2617 [3] and IETF RFC 2246 [4] according to ETSI TS 183
038 [12].
Procedures regarding Operator Determined Barring (ODB) are defined in 3GPP TS
24.315 [16].
#### 5.2.3.2 Authentication and authorization
##### 5.2.3.2.0 General
If an Authentication Proxy (AP) is provided in the path of the HTTP request,
then the AS receives an HTTP request from a trusted source (the AP) and
contains an HTTP X‑3GPP‑Asserted‑Identity header (3GPP TS 24.109 [5]) that
includes an asserted identity of the user. In this case the AS does not need
to authenticate the user, but just provide authorization to access the
requested resource.
If an HTTP X‑3GPP‑Asserted‑Identity header (3GPP TS 24.109 [5]) is not present
in the HTTP request or if the request is received from a non‑trusted source,
then the AS needs to authenticate the user prior to providing authorization to
the XCAP resource by applying the procedures of authentication mechanisms
specified in 3GPP TS 33.222 [6] and 3GPP TS 24.109 [5] in case Generic
Authentication Architecture is supported, or as described in subclause
5.2.3.2.1 otherwise.
##### 5.2.3.2.1 HTTP digest authentication
On receiving an HTTP request that does not contain an Authorization header the
AS shall:
a) challenge the user by generating a 401 Unauthorized response that contains
the proper Digest authentication parameters (e.g. realm), according to IETF
RFC 2617 [3]. Provisioning of credentials to authenticate the user is outside
the scope of the present document; and
```{=html}
``` i) forward the 401 Unauthorized response to the sender of the HTTP
request.
On receiving an HTTP request that contains an Authorization header, the AS
shall:
a) apply the authentication procedures defined in IETF RFC 2617 [3]; and
```{=html}
``` j) authorize or deny authorization depending on the authenticated
identity.
#### 5.2.3.3 Subscription acceptance and notification of state changes in XML
document
When the AS receives a SUBSCRIBE request having the Event header field value
set to \"xcap-diff\", the AS shall first authenticate the source of the
SUBSCRIBE request and then perform authorization. Afterwards, the AS shall
generate a response to the SUBSCRIBE request and notifications in accordance
with RFC 5875 [11].
#### 5.2.3.4 Validation against service capability
On receiving a XCAP request to modify service settings for a supplementary
service, the AS shall check whether service capability fragments within the
simservs document for the subscription of the sender for the XCAP request are
available. If a service capability fragment within the simservs document is
available, the AS shall validate the XCAP request against constraints defined
in that service capability fragment and only accept modifications that are
allowed by the service capability fragment. If the validation fails, the AS
shall respond with a HTTP 409 (Conflict) response as defined in IETF RFC 4825
[8].
NOTE: The XML schema for a service capability fragment for a supplementary
service is defined in the respective supplementary service specification.
## 5.3 Roles
### 5.3.1 XCAP client
#### 5.3.1.1 Introduction
The XCAP client is a logical function as defined in IETF RFC 4825 [8]. The
XCAP client provides the means to manipulate the general data, such as
configuration settings related to supplementary services.
In order to manipulate XCAP resources stored on the XCAP server, the XCAP
client uses the XCAP Root URI as defined in subclause 13.9.1 of 3GPP TS 23.003
[15]. The UE implementing the XCAP client can be provisioned with an XCAP Root
URI as specified in Appendix C in OMA-TS-XDM_Core-V1_1-20080627-A [14].
NOTE: In order to be able to manipulate XCAP resources stored on the XCAP
server, the XCAP client needs to know the user\'s directory name. It is
assumed that this value is pre‑provisioned or the UE uses some means to
discover it. Discovery mechanisms are outside the scope of the present
document.
#### 5.3.1.2 Manipulating supplementary services
When the XCAP client intends to manipulate a resource list, it shall generate
an HTTP PUT, HTTP GET or\ HTTP DELETE request in accordance with IETF RFC 4825
[8] and the supplementary services application usage specified in clause 6.
### 5.3.2 XCAP server
#### 5.3.2.1 Introduction
The XCAP server is a logical function as defined in IETF RFC 4825 [8]. The
XCAP server can store data related to the configuration of supplementary
services. The XCAP server shall provide or deny authorization to access XCAP
resources by authenticated users.
#### 5.3.2.2 Manipulation acceptance
When the XCAP server receives an HTTP PUT, HTTP GET or HTTP DELETE request for
manipulating or fetching a resource list, the XCAP server shall first
authenticate the request and then perform authorization. Subclause 5.2.2
provides more details on the authentication and authorization of HTTP
requests.
Afterwards the XCAP server shall perform the requested action and generate a
response in accordance with\ IETF RFC 4825 [8] and the supplementary services
application usage specified in clause 6.
# 6 Supplementary services XCAP application usage
## 6.1 Structure of the XML document
XCAP provides for the existence of application usages that define the
conventions and constrains related to the manipulation of XML documents in an
XCAP server. The present document defines a supplementary services XCAP
application usage.
NOTE: Further releases can extend this application usage when deemed
practical.
The present document follows a modular approach, as depicted in figure 4. We
provide for the existence of a _simservs_ XML document that contains the data
associated to one or more supplementary services. The _simservs_ XML document
is composed of a common part, defined by the present document, and a number of
XML fragments corresponding to each of the supplementary services. This
modular approach has significant advantages. Particularly, it is versatile
enough to allow any number of configurations. For example, in one
configuration, an XCAP server might be managing a given server. In this case,
the _simservs_ XML document will contain one subtree per service. In another
configuration, each service is managed in its own XCAP server, case in which
the XML document in each XCAP server will contain the common parts and a
single XML subtree that manages the service. Yet in a third configuration the
XCAP server stores several XML documents, each document managing one or more
services.
The XML schema for the _simservs_ XML document, including the common parts, is
specified in subclause 6.3. This XML schema allows for each of the individual
XML schemas pertaining to a particular service to import the common parts XML
schema. Each XML fragment affects the settings of a supplementary service (or
group of services). The XML schema of each of the supplementary services is
specified in its own specification. A template of the XML schema for a
supplementary service is provided in subclause 6.4.
{width="1.8375in" height="3.3715277777777777in"}
Figure 4: Structure of a supplementary services XML document
The _simservs_ XML document starts with a \ root XML element that
can contain one or more child elements pertaining to supplementary services.
Each of these service elements can contain an \"active\" attribute that
indicates whether the service is activated or not. When the \"active\"
attribute is absent on a service element, it indicates that the service is
activated. Elements and attributes from different namespaces can be present as
well. Services may also include capability elements that are read-only. These
elements indicate which capabilities the network has provisioned for a user.
## 6.2 XCAP application usage
XCAP requires application usages to fulfil a number of steps in the definition
of such application usage. The reminder of this clause specifies the required
definitions of the supplementary services XCAP Application Usage.
**Application Unique ID (AUID):** Each XCAP application usage is associated
with a unique name called the Application Unique ID (AUID). The AUID defined
by this application usage falls into the vendor‑proprietary namespace of XCAP
AUID, where ETSI is considered a vendor.
The AUID allocated to the supplementary services XCAP application usage is:
simservs.ngn.etsi.org
**XML schema:** Implementations in compliance with the present document shall
implement the XML schema that includes the XML Schema defined in clause 6.3.
Additionally, each supplementary service (or group of them) is modelled with a
XML fragment that is validated according to a specific XML schema. The XML
schema that affects the settings of the related service is specified in the
specification of the given supplementary service. Subclause 6.4 provides a
template that shall be included in XML Schema that also includes the XML
Schema defined in subclause 6.3 along with inclusion of XML schema defined by
each of the supplementary services that implement XML schemas for data
manipulation. Additionally the schema in subclause 6.3 contains the
specification of a number of common service specific elements and types, the
semantics and applicability of these elements is described in the service
specifications that use them.
**Default namespace:** XCAP requires application usages to declare the default
namespace. The default namespace of the supplementary services XCAP
application usage is:
http://uri.etsi.org/ngn/params/xml/simservs/xcap
**MIME type:** The MIME type of supplementary services XML documents is:
application/vnd.etsi.simservs+xml
**Validation constraints: T** he present document does not specify any
additional constraint beyond those defined by XCAP RFC 4825 [8]. Note,
however, that each of the supplementary services may specify additional
constraints on each of the XML subdocuments.
**Data semantics:** The XML schema does not accept URIs that could be
expressed as a relative URI reference causing a resolution problem. However,
each of the supplementary services should consider if relative URIs are
allowed in the subdocument tree, and in that case, they should indicate how to
resolve relative URI references. In the absence of further indications,
relative URI references should be resolved using the document URI as the base
of the relative URI reference.
**Naming conventions:** By default, supplementary services XML documents are
stored under the user\'s Home Directory (which is located under the \"users\"
sub‑tree). In order to facilitate the manipulation of a supplementary services
XML document, we define a default XML file name:
simservs.xml
**Resource interdependencies:** The present document does not specify
additional resource interdependency beyond those specified in the XML schema
and beyond any resource interdependency that may be specified in each of
supplementary services.
**Authorization policies:** The following authorization policy applies to the
owner of _simservs_ XML document:
a) authorised to retrieve any part of the document;
b) unauthorised to create:
1) new child element(s) to the \ root element; and
2) new attribute(s) for a child element of the the \ root element;
c) unauthorised to remove:
1) existing child element(s) from the \ root element; and
2) existing attribute(s) from a child element of the \ root element;
d) unauthorised to replace or remove:
1) read-only child element(s) of the \ root element, their
attributes and their content;
e) unauthorised to replace:
1) descendant element(s) of the \ root element that are not allowed
to be modified by the service capability fragments as described in subclause
5.2.3.4; and
2) attribute(s) within descendant element(s) of the the \ root
element that are not allowed to be modified by the service capability
fragments as described in subclause 5.2.3.4; and
f) authorized to replace element(s) and attribute(s) other than those
specified in bullet d).
Users other than the owner of the _simservs_ XML document are unauthorised to
perform any operation on the document.
Unauthorized manipulation attempts on the _simservs_ XML document are rejected
with an HTTP 409 (Conflict) response as defined in IETF RFC 4825 [8].
NOTE 1: It is allowed to replace the _simservs_ XML document or its
\ root element containing read-only child elements provided that the
read-only child elements, including their content, are preserved.
NOTE 2: Any child elements of the \ root element of the _simservs_
XML document unknown to the XCAP client can be potentially read-only.
