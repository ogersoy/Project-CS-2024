# Introduction
The present document defines the external interface characteristics of the
Contact Manager for 3GPP UICC applications (e.g. USIM [3] and ISIM [4]). The
Contact Manager provides an interface for the management of contact
information including rich content without any structural limitations.
The Contact Manager Server application resides on the UICC, an IC card
specified in TS 31.101 [2]. TS 31.101 [2] specifies the application
independent properties of the UICC/terminal interface such as the physical
characteristics.
The external interface between the Contact Manager Server application on the
UICC and the Contact Manager Client application on the ME enables the
synchronization of the contact information, contacts grouping, configuration
of contact structure, configuration of the triggering mechanism, and
configuration of user actions which may be performed using contact
information.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the Contact Manager for 3GPP UICC applications
based on OMA DS [7].
The present document specifies the external interface between the Contact
Manager Server in the UICC and the Contact Manager External Client in the ME;
Any internal technical realization of either the Contact Manager Server or
clients is only specified where these are reflected over the interfaces.

multimedia elements (e.g. a picture, a ring tone, a voice tag and/or a video).
The DTD of the \"GroupsDefinition.xml\" file is provided in annex C of the
present document.
3GPP-specific vCard Type may be used to associate a vCard with a group defined
in \"GroupsDefinition.xml\". For that purpose, the \"X-3GPP-GroupUID\" Type
shall be inserted in the vCard to point to the corresponding group definition
in the \"GroupsDefinition.xml\" file.
If \"X-3GPP-GroupUID\" contains a group Unique Identifier that does not exist
in \"GroupsDefinition.xml\" (e.g. because it was deleted), then the Contact
Manager External Client shall remove \"X-3GPP-GroupUID\" from the vCard(s).
\"X-3GPP-GroupUID\" is defined in Annex D.
The DTD of the \"GroupsDefinition.xml\" file is provided in annex C of the
present document.
## 4.7 3GPP specific contacts elements
3GPP-specific vCard Types may be used to associate additional multimedia
elements to a vCard (e.g. a ring tone, a voice tag and/or a video) or to store
additional contact information in a vCard (e.g. SIP URI, TEL URI). In this
case, the 3GPP-specific vCard Types are used.
The 3GPP-specific vCard Types are defined in Annex D.
## 4.8 Synchronization with an external device
The support of synchronization with an external device (e.g. a Laptop Computer
connected to the ME through a local link) is optional.
An ME supporting synchronization with an external device shall play the role
