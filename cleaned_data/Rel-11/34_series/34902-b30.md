# 4 General Principles
## 4.1 Principle of Superposition
For multi-cell tests there are several cells each generating various channels.
Each cell contributes both specific channels, for example the CPICH, and also
interference in the form of OCNS. The cells are combined along with AWGN, so
the actual signal to noise ratio seen by the UE is determined by more than one
cell.
Since several cells contribute towards the overall power applied to the UE, a
number of test system uncertainties affect the signal to noise ratio seen by
the UE. The aim of the superposition method given in the present document is
to vary each controllable parameter of the test system separately, and to
establish its effect on the critical parameters as seen by the UE receiver.
The superposition principle then allows the effect of each test system
uncertainty to be added, to calculate the overall effect.
The contributing test system uncertainties shall form a minimum set for the
superposition principle to be applicable.
## 4.2 Sensitivity analysis
A change in any one channel level or channel ratio generated at source does
not necessarily have a 1:1 effect at the UE. The effect of each controllable
parameter of the test system on the critical parameters as seen by the UE
receiver shall therefore be established. As a consequence of the sensitivity
scaling factors not necessarily being unity, the test system uncertainties
cannot be directly applied as test tolerances to the critical parameters as
seen by the UE.
For many of the tests described, the CPICH_Ec/Io is the critical parameter at
the UE. Scaling factors are used to model the sensitivity of the CPICH_Ec/Io
to each test system uncertainty. When the scaling factors have been
determined, the superposition principle then allows the effect of each test
system uncertainty to be added, to give the overall variability in the
critical parameters as seen at the UE.
The test requirement guidelines place constraints on several parameters at the
UE. The aim of the sensitivity analysis, together with the acceptable test
system uncertainties, is to ensure that the variability in each of these
parameters is controlled within the limits defined by the test requirement
guidelines.
## 4.3 Statistical combination of uncertainties
The acceptable uncertainties of the test system are specified as the
measurement uncertainty tolerance interval for a specific measurement that
contains 95 % of the performance of a population of test equipment, in
accordance with 3GPP TS 34.121 Ref [1, 2, 3] clause F.1. In the multi-cell RRM
tests covered by the present document, the Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
range, with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
The method given in the present document combines the acceptable uncertainties
of the test system, to give the overall variability in the critical parameters
as seen at the UE. Since the process does not add any new uncertainties, the
method of combination should be chosen to maintain the same tolerance interval
for the combined uncertainty as is already specified for the contributing test
system uncertainties.
The basic principle for combining uncertainties is in accordance with ETR
273-1-2 [4]. In summary, the process requires 3 steps:
a) Express the value of each contributing uncertainty as a one standard
deviation figure, from knowledge of its numeric value and its distribution.
b) Combine all the one standard deviation figures as root-sum-squares, to give
the one standard deviation value for the combined uncertainty.
c) Expand the combined uncertainty by a coverage factor, according to the
tolerance interval required.
Provided that the contributing uncertainties have already been obtained using
this method, using a coverage factor of 2, further stages of combination can
be achieved by performing step b) alone, since steps a) and c) simply divide
by 2 and multiply by 2 respectively.
The root-sum-squares method is therefore used to maintain the same tolerance
interval for the combined uncertainty as is already specified for the
contributing test system uncertainties. In some cases where correlation
between contributing uncertainties has an adverse effect, the method is
modified in accordance with clause 4.4.5 of the present document.
In each _Error summation_ sheet of the spreadsheets in Annex A, the column
labelled _Combi_ adds up the correlated errors arithmetically first, then adds
the result root-sum-squares to the uncorrelated errors. This has been selected
as the most realistic model for these tests, and is in accordance with the
treatment described in clauses 4.4.4 to 4.4.7 of the present document.
The combination of uncertainties using the spreadsheets in the present
document is performed using dB values for simplicity. It has been shown that
using dB uncertainty values gives a slightly worse combined uncertainty result
than using linear values for the uncertainties. The analysis in the present
document therefore errs on the safe side.
## 4.4 Correlation between uncertainties
The statistical (root-sum-square) addition of uncertainties is based on the
assumption that the uncertainties are independent of each other. For
realisable test systems, the uncertainties may not be fully independent. The
validity of the method used to add uncertainties depends on both the type of
correlation and on the way in which the uncertainties affect the test
requirements.
Clauses 4.4.1 to 4.4.3 give examples to illustrate different types of
correlation.
Clauses 4.4.4 to 4.4.7 show how the scenarios applicable to multi carrier RRM
tests are treated.
### 4.4.1 Uncorrelated uncertainties
The graph shows an example of two test system uncertainties, A and B, which
affect a test requirement. Each sample from a population of test systems has a
specific value of error in parameter A, and a specific value of error in
parameter B. Each dot on the graph represents a sample from a population of
test systems, and is plotted according to its error values for parameters A
and B.
It can be seen that a positive value of error in parameter A, for example, is
equally likely to occur with either a positive or a negative value of error in
parameter B. This is expected when two parameters are uncorrelated, such as
two uncertainties which arise from different and unrelated parts of the test
system.
### 4.4.2 Positively correlated uncertainties
The graph shows an example of two test system uncertainties, A and B, which
affect a test requirement. Each sample from a population of test systems has a
specific value of error in parameter A, and a specific value of error in
parameter B. Each dot on the graph represents a sample from a population of
test systems, and is plotted according to its error values for parameters A
and B.
It can be seen that a positive value of error in parameter A, for example, is
more likely to occur with a positive value of error in parameter B and less
likely to occur with a negative value of error in parameter B. This can occur
when the two uncertainties arise from similar parts of the test system, or
when one component of the uncertainty affects both parameters in a similar
way.
In an extreme case, if the error in parameter A and the error in parameter B
came from the same sources of uncertainty, and no others, the dots would lie
on a straight line of slope +1.
### 4.4.3 Negatively correlated uncertainties
The graph shows an example of two test system uncertainties, A and B, which
affect a test condition. Each sample from a population of test systems has a
specific value of error in parameter A, and a specific value of error in
parameter B. Each dot on the graph represents a sample from a population of
test systems, and is plotted according to its error values for parameters A
and B.
It can be seen that a positive value of error in parameter A, for example, is
more likely to occur with a negative value of error in parameter B and less
likely to occur with a positive value of error in parameter B. This effect can
theoretically occur, and is included for completeness, but is unlikely in a
practical test system.
### 4.4.4 Treatment of uncorrelated uncertainties
If two uncertainties are uncorrelated, they are added statistically in the
spreadsheets in Annex A. Provided that each uncertainty is already expressed
as an expanded uncertainty with coverage factor 2, the contributing
uncertainties are added root-sum-squares to give a combined uncertainty which
also has coverage factor 2, and the 95% tolerance interval is maintained.
The assumption is written in the form \"Uncertainty A and Uncertainty B are
uncorrelated to each other\".
### 4.4.5 Treatment of positively correlated uncertainties with adverse effect
If two test system uncertainties are positively correlated, and if they affect
the value of a critical parameter in the same direction, the combined effect
may be greater than predicted by adding the contributing uncertainties root-
sum-squares.
EXAMPLE: In 3GPP TS 34.121 Ref [1, 2, 3] test 8.3.5.2, the level uncertainty
of Ior (3) relative to Ior (1) and the level uncertainty of Ior (4) relative
to Ior (1) may be positively correlated, since the same method may be used to
set up Ior (3) and Ior (4). Both of these level uncertainties affect the
CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1 in the same direction.
In this scenario the two uncertainties are added worst-case in the
spreadsheets in Annex A. Provided that each uncertainty is already expressed
as an expanded uncertainty with coverage factor 2, the combined uncertainty
will cover a 95% tolerance interval even when the two contributing
uncertainties are fully correlated. If the two contributing uncertainties are
less than fully correlated, the combined uncertainty will cover a tolerance
interval greater than 95%.
The assumption is written in the form \"Uncertainty A and Uncertainty B may
have any amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated) \".
### 4.4.6 Treatment of positively correlated uncertainties with beneficial
effect
If two test system uncertainties are positively correlated, and if they affect
the value of a critical parameter in opposite directions, the combined effect
will be less than predicted by adding the contributing uncertainties root-sum-
squares.
EXAMPLE: In 3GPP TS 34.121 Ref [1, 2, 3] test 8.3.5.2, the absolute level
uncertainty of Ior (1) and the absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (1) may be
positively correlated. These level uncertainties affect the CPICH_Ec/Io of
Cell 1 in opposite directions, so positive correlation will tend to reduce the
uncertainty in CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1.
In this scenario the two uncertainties are added statistically in the
spreadsheets in Annex A. Provided that each uncertainty is already expressed
as an expanded uncertainty with coverage factor 2, the combined uncertainty
will cover a 95% tolerance interval when the two contributing uncertainties
are uncorrelated. If the two contributing uncertainties are positively
correlated, the combined uncertainty will cover a tolerance interval greater
than 95%.
The assumption is written in the form \"Uncertainty A and Uncertainty B may
have any amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated)\".
### 4.4.7 Treatment of negatively correlated uncertainties
Negatively correlated uncertainties are excluded by the assumptions. This has
been agreed as an acceptable restriction on practical test systems, as the
mechanisms which produce correlation generally arise from similarities between
two parts of the test system, and therefore produce positive correlation.
# 5 One frequency multi-cell FDD tests
For the one-frequency tests all the cells are on the same channel, so the UE
receiver is tuned to one channel. All the cells, and the noise, determine the
CPICH_Ec/Io ratio.
## 5.1 Test 8.2.2.1 Cell reselection in idle mode, one frequency
### 5.1.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.2.2.1.2.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
{width="5.988194444444445in" height="2.65625in"}
The main points to note about the cell set-up for the one-frequency test are:
\- The overall power within the radio channel does not change between T1 and
T2, so the T1 and T2 pies are the same size.
\- The noise is only a small fraction of the overall power.
\- Cells 1 and 2 exchange values from T1 to T2.
\- Cells 3 to 6 remain unchanged from T1 to T2.
### 5.1.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The worst-case difference during time T1 between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
c) The worst-case difference during time T2 between Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
d) In order to ensure the geometry factors Îor/Ioc remain centred on the
values stated in the original table, the nominal Io stated in the original
table shall not be modified.
e) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3 through 6 shall not be higher than
the value stated in the original table. This will prevent the interfering
cells from having a larger impact on the test than originally intended.
f) Provided guideline c) is met first, the worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3
through 6 shall not fall below the CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range of --24 dB.
g) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
h) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.1.3 Uncertainty parameter set
One cell has been chosen as the reference, and has its power specified as an
absolute accuracy. The other cells are specified relative to the reference
cell. The other cells are not directly specified with respect to each other,
as this would be a redundant constraint.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
##### During T1: {#during-t1 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (1, 3, 4, 5, 6) relative to Ior (2): +/- 0.3dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (2): +/-0.7dB
##### During T2: {#during-t2 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
##### During T1 and T2: {#during-t1-and-t2 .H6}
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.1.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) The relative uncertainties for Ior(n) across different cells may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
e) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(n) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
f) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(2) at T1 and the relative uncertainty of
Ior(1, 3, 4, 5, 6), are uncorrelated to each other. Similarly, the absolute
uncertainty of Ior(1) at T2 and the relative uncertainty of Ior(2, 3, 4, 5,
6), are uncorrelated to each other.
### 5.1.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.1.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.1.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.1.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet. It is necessary to first calculate the sensitivities before entering
the equations in the _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T1 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell P25 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((25.1*0.1)/(4.8+25.1+50.1+5+5+5+5))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, noise + 6 cells,
> added up as percentages.
>
> \- The _25.1_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T1, as
> a percentage.
>
> \- The _*0.1_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in Cell
> 2 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --16.00326dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell P26 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((25.1*0.1)/(4.8*(10\^(0.01/10))+25.1+50.1+5+5+5+5))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --16.00374dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.048, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example the value is copied into cell P11
of the _Error summation_ sheet.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.048, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 13 contributing uncertainties on the one-frequency test is treated
the same way by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then
copied into the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE
parameter listed in column A.
In cases where the value can be deduced as 1.000 or 0 by inspection the
sensitivity is entered directly.
EXAMPLE: A change in the in the CPICH_Ec/Ior of Cell 3 will have no effect on
the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio, so the sensitivity is entered as 0 in cell I27
of the _Error summation_ sheet.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell P6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell P11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell P12.
#### 5.1.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.15.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 6 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet. For
this exercise only the Cell levels at T1 are considered, since the outcome at
T2 will be the same but with the effects from cells 1 and 2 reversed.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17 and 20 on the
_Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to
each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause
5.1.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test
system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors in
column U has been selected as the most realistic model for these tests, and is
consistent with the assumptions given in clause 5.1.4.
#### 5.1.5.3 Derivation of equations for Ior(n)
The _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet is used.
EXAMPLE: The Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io requirement is calculated using the following
equation, which is copied from cell F19 of the _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet, and is given in the same format:
Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io (Req) =
F18+SQRT((0.251*C4)\^2+(0.048*C3)\^2+(4*0.05*C4)\^2+(0.048*C17)\^2)
> \- The _F18_ term is the nominal Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io
>
> \- The _0.251*C4_ term is the effect of Cell 1 Ior(n) relative uncertainty
>
> \- The _0.048*C3_ term is the effect of Cell 2 Ior(n) absolute uncertainty
>
> \- The _4*0.05*C4_ term is the effect of Cells 3 to 6 Ior(n) relative
> uncertainty, added worst-case because they will be correlated to each other
>
> \- The _0.048*C17_ term is the effect of Noise Ioc absolute uncertainty
The uncorrelated terms are added as root-sum-squares.
A similar process is used for cell D19 to get Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io (Req), making
sure that it meets the required difference between Cell 1 and Cell 2:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io (Req) = F19-(F18-D18)-SQRT(C8\^2+C8\^2+C4\^2)
\- The _F19_ term is the required Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io
\- The _(F18-D18)_ term is the nominal difference
\- The _SQRT(C8\^2+C8\^2+C4\^2)_ term takes account of the relevant
uncertainties, which all happen to have a sensitivity of 1.
#### 5.1.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
The \"Goal seek\" spreadsheet tool is used to choose a value of Cells 1 and 2
CPICH offset in cell K24 which meets the target of --56.735 dBm for Io in cell
D26.
The Ior(n) powers in cells D35 to O35 are then carried forward to the _Error
analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.1.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell K27 set to +0.005, the set value of Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io at
T1 is --16.28dB as shown in cell D20, but it may be as high as --15.97dB (cell
D21) or as low as --16.58dB (cell D22). The high and low values are obtained
by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.1.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
The channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were given an initial offset in
clause 5.1.5.4. Comparing the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low)
values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset,
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause 5.1.2 a).
An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been
added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.6 dB in cell K27 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K26 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
#### 5.1.5.7 Determination of Cell 3, Cell 4, Cell 5 and Cell 6 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 3 to 6 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the
test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would
fall outside the limits specified in clauses 5.1.2 e) and 5.1.2 f). An offset
to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratios in Cells 3 to 6 has therefore been added in
the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of -0.5 dB in cell K25 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K24 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 3 to 6 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS increases to keep the overall power of Cells 3 to 6 correct.
### 5.1.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.1 References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --15.98dB and --12.45dB, which
comply with the requirements of -16dB and --13dB for Cell 1 at T1 and T2
respectively.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells F22 and G22 give --12.45dB and --15.98dB, which
comply with the requirements of -13dB and --16dB for Cell 2 at T1 and T2
respectively.
b) The worst-case difference during time T1 between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell D24 gives a difference of -3.07dB for Cell 1
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io, which complies with the requirement of -3dB
during time T1.
c) The worst-case difference during time T2 between Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E25 gives a difference of 3.07dB for Cell 1
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io, which complies with the requirement of 3dB
during time T2.
d) In order to ensure the geometry factors Îor/Ioc remain centred on the
values stated in the original table, the nominal Io stated in the original
table shall not be modified.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D27 and E27 give a nominal Io of \--56.72dBm,
which is within 0.01dB of the stated value of --56.73dBm.
e) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3 through 6 shall not be higher than
the value stated in the original table. This will prevent the interfering
cells from having a larger impact on the test than originally intended.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells H21 to O21 all give values of --23.05dB, which
comply with the requirements of -23dB for Cells 3 to 6.
f) Provided guideline c) is met first, the worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3
through 6 shall not fall below the CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range of --24 dB.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells H22 to O22 all give values of --23.90dB, which
comply with the requirements of -24dB for Cells 3 to 6.
g) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G13 show that the channel power ratios of
all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are increased by
the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is subject to the
same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to comply under
guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall below the stated
Ec/Io ratio.
h) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
The channel power ratios of all the active channels in Cells 3 to 6 have been
decreased by 0.5dB to meet guideline e). This change will have no material
effect on the test.
## 5.2 Test 8.3.1 FDD/FDD Soft Handover
### 5.2.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.3.1.2.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
{width="6.656944444444444in" height="3.5034722222222223in"}
The main points to note about the cell set-up are:
\- T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 have the same cell conditions.
\- The overall power within the radio channel changes between T1 and
T2/T3/T4/T5/T6, so the pies are different sizes.
\- Cell 1 is bigger in absolute power during T2/T3/T4/T5/T6 compared to its
initial value in T1.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T1, and only appears during T2/T3/T4/T5/T6.
> \- The noise remains the same absolute power from T1 to T2, but becomes a
> smaller fraction of the overall power.
### 5.2.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2/T3/T4/T5/T6 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value
of the reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE
CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure
that Event 1A (A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs.
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.2.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Cell 1 has been chosen as the reference, and has its power specified as an
absolute accuracy. Cell 2 is specified relative to the reference cell.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
##### During T1: {#during-t1-1 .H6}
None apply only during T1
##### During T2/T3/T4/T5/T6: {#during-t2t3t4t5t6 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
##### During T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6: {#during-t1-t2-t3-t4-t5-and-t6 .H6}
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.2.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(n) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
e) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(1) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(2),
are uncorrelated to each other.
### 5.2.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.2.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.2.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.2.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet. It is necessary to first calculate the sensitivities before entering
the equations in the _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T2/T3/T4/T5/T6 is calculated
using the following equation, which is copied from cell M23 of the _Error
summation_ sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((\$F\$22*\$G\$22)/(\$F\$22+\$J\$22+\$M\$22))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 2 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$F\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at
> T2/T3/T4/T5/T6, as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$G\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --14.00000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell M24 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$22*\$G\$22)/(\$F\$22+\$J\$22+\$M\$22*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --14.00204 dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.204, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell M11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.204, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 5 contributing uncertainties on the one-frequency test is treated
the same way by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then
copied into the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE
parameter listed in column A. Because the conditions at T1 and T2/T3/T4/T5/T6
are different, the process is carried out twice: once for T1 and once for
T2/T3/T4/T5/T6.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when
Cell 2 does not exist during T1.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell M6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell M11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell M12.
#### 5.2.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.2.5.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T1 and for T2/T3/T4/T5/T6.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, and 17 on the
_Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to
each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause
5.2.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test
system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns R and V as the most realistic model, but is the
same as root-sum-squares combination for these tests because no adverse
effects of correlation are envisaged. This is consistent with the assumptions
given in clause 5.2.4.
#### 5.2.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_
sheet is used to calculate the nominal powers for each cell, but no
uncertainties are applied, so it generates the same values as the _Original_
sheet.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to G35 of the _Apply uncertainties \--
Find Ior_ sheet, and are carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.2.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell K24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.2.5.6.
#### 5.2.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell K24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at
T2/T3/T4/T5/T6 is --14.00dB as shown in cell G20, but it may be as high as
--13.68dB (cell G21) or as low as --14.32dB (cell G22). The high and low
values are obtained by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties
to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.2.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low)
values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset,
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause 5.2.2 a).
An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been
added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.7 dB in cell K24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
### 5.2.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.2 References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --12.93dB and --13.60dB at T1
and T2/T3/T4/T5/T6 respectively, which comply with the requirement of \--13 dB
and --14 dB for Cell 1 at T1 and T2/T3/T4/T5/T6 respectively.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell G22 gives --13.62 dB at T2/T3/T4/T5/T6, which
complies with the requirement of --14 dB for Cell 2.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2/T3/T4/T5/T6 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value
of the reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE
CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure
that Event 1A (A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E25 gives a difference of -0.33dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 1.5dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy) the lowest reported value would be \--1.83dB, which complies with
the requirement of -3dB during time T2/T3/T4/T5/T6.
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D27 and E27 give nominal Io values of \--66.99dBm
and --63.1dBm at T1 and T2/T3/T4/T5/T6 respectively, which are within 0.01dB
of the stated values of --66.98dBm and --63.09dBm.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G13 show that the channel power ratios of
all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are increased by
the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is subject to the
same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to comply under
guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall below the stated
Ec/Io ratio.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
## 5.3 Test 8.3.2.1 FDD/FDD Hard Handover to intra-frequency cell
### 5.3.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.3.2.1.2.

The main points to note about the cell set-up for the one-frequency test are:
\- T2 and T3 have the same cell conditions.
\- The overall power within the radio channel changes between T1 and T2/T3, so
the pies are different sizes.
\- Cell 1 is bigger in absolute power during T2/T3 compared to its initial
value in T1.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T1, and only appears during T2/T3.
\- The noise remains the same absolute power from T1 to T2, but becomes a
smaller fraction of the overall power.

### 5.3.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.3.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.3.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.3.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet. It is necessary to first calculate the sensitivities before entering
the equations in the _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T2/T3 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell M23 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((\$F\$22*\$G\$22)/(\$F\$22+\$J\$22+\$M\$22))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 2 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$F\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at
> T2/T3, as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$G\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --13.00000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell M24 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$22*\$G\$22)/(\$F\$22+\$J\$22+\$M\$22*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --13.00101dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.101, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell M11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.101, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 5 contributing uncertainties on the one-frequency test is treated
the same way by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then
copied into the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE
parameter listed in column A. Because the conditions at T1 and T2/T3 are
different, the process is carried out twice: once for T1 and once for T2/T3.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when
Cell 2 does not exist during T1.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell M6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell M11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell M12.
#### 5.3.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.3.5.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T1 and for T2/T3.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, and 17 on the
_Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to
each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause
5.3.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test
system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall

has been selected in columns R and V as the most realistic model, but is the

sheet is used to calculate the nominal powers for each cell, but no
uncertainties are applied, so it generates the same values as the _Original_
sheet.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to G35 of the _Apply uncertainties \--
Find Ior_ sheet, and are carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.3.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell K24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.3.5.6.
#### 5.3.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell K24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2/T3
is --14.00dB as shown in cell G20, but it may be as high as \--13.76dB (cell
G21) or as low as --14.24dB (cell G22). The high and low values are obtained
by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.3.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low)
values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset,
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause 5.3.2 a).
An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been
added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.7 dB in cell K24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
### 5.3.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.3 References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --12.93dB and --12.50dB at T1
and T2/T3 respectively, which comply with the requirement of -13dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell G22 gives --13.54dB at T2/T3, which complies with
the requirement of -14dB for Cell 2.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2/T3 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E25 gives a difference of -1.33dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 1.5dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy) the lowest reported value would be \--2.83dB, which complies with
the requirement of -3dB during time T2/T3.
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D27 and E27 give nominal Io values of \--66.99dBm
and --60.00dBm at T1 and T2/T3 respectively, which are within 0.03dB of the
stated values of --66.98dBm and --60.03dBm.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G13 show that the channel power ratios of
all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are increased by
the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is subject to the
same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to comply under
guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall below the stated
Ec/Io ratio.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.

### 5.8.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.6.1.1.2.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
{width="5.988194444444445in" height="2.7118055555555554in"}
The main points to note about the cell set-up are:
\- T1 and T4 have the same cell conditions.
\- T2 and T3 have the same cell conditions.
\- The overall power within the radio channel changes between T1/T4 and T2/T3,
so the pies are different sizes.
\- Cell 1 is bigger in absolute power during T2/T3 compared to its value in
T1/T4.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T1/T4, and only appears during T2/T3.
\- The noise remains the same absolute power from T1/T4 to T2/T3, but becomes
a smaller fraction of the overall power.
### 5.8.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2/T3 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs.
d) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.8.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Cell 1 has been chosen as the reference, and has its power specified as an
absolute accuracy. Cell 2 is specified relative to the reference cell.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
##### During T1/T4: {#during-t1t4 .H6}
None apply only during T1/T4
##### During T2/T3: {#during-t2t3-1 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
##### During T1, T2, T3 and T4: {#during-t1-t2-t3-and-t4 .H6}
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.8.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(n) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
e) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(1) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(2),
are uncorrelated to each other.
### 5.8.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.5.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.8.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.8.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T2/T3 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell M23 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((\$F\$22*\$G\$22)/(\$F\$22+\$J\$22+\$M\$22))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 2 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$F\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at
> T2/T3, as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$G\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --13.00000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell M24 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$22*\$G\$22)/(\$F\$22+\$J\$22+\$M\$22*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --13.00101dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.101, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell M11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.101, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 5 contributing uncertainties for this test is treated the same way
by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then copied into
the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed
in column A. Because the conditions at T1/T4 and T2/T3 are different, the
process is carried out twice: once for T1/T4 and once for T2/T3.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when
Cell 2 does not exist during T1/T4.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell M6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell M11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell M12.
#### 5.8.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.8.5.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T1/T4 and for T2/T3.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, and 17 on the
_Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to
each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause
5.8.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test
system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns R and V as the most realistic model, but is the
same as root-sum-squares combination for these tests because no adverse
effects of correlation are envisaged. This is consistent with the assumptions
given in clause 5.8.4.
#### 5.8.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_
sheet is used to calculate the nominal powers for each cell, but no
uncertainties are applied, so it generates the same values as the _Original_
sheet.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to G35 of the _Apply uncertainties \--
Find Ior_ sheet, and are carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.8.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell K24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.8.5.6.
#### 5.8.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell K24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2/T3
is --14.00dB as shown in cell G20, but it may be as high as \--13.76dB (cell
G21) or as low as --14.24dB (cell G22). The high and low values are obtained
by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.8.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low)
values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset,
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause 5.8.2 a).
An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been
added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.7 dB in cell K24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
### 5.8.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.5. References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --12.93dB and --12.50dB at T1/T4
and T2/T3 respectively, which comply with the requirement of -13dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell G22 gives --13.54dB at T2/T3, which complies with
the requirement of -14dB for Cell 2.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2/T3 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E25 gives a difference of -1.33dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 1.5dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy) the lowest reported value would be \--2.83dB, which complies with
the requirement of -3dB during time T2/T3.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell D24 gives a difference of -87dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Although this is only calculated as a
nominal figure which is dependent on the "-99.99" number entered in cell F18
of the _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet , it clearly complies with the
requirement of -3dB during time T4.
d) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D27 and E27 give nominal Io values of \--66.99dBm
and --60.00dBm at T1/T4 and T2/T3 respectively, which are within 0.03dB of the
stated values of --66.98dBm and --60.03dBm.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G13 show that the channel power ratios of
all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are increased by
the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is subject to the
same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to comply under
guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall below the stated
Ec/Io ratio.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.

### 5.8A.4 Assumptions
Same as defined for test 8.6.1.1 in clause 5.8.4.
### 5.8A.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.5A.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.8A.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.8A.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T2 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell M23 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((\$F\$22*\$G\$22)/(\$F\$22+\$J\$22+\$M\$22))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 2 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$F\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T2,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$G\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --13.00000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell M24 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$22*\$G\$22)/(\$F\$22+\$J\$22+\$M\$22*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --13.00101dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.101, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell M11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.101, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 5 contributing uncertainties for this test is treated the same way

the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed
in column A. Because the conditions at T1/T3 and T2 are different, the process
is carried out twice: once for T1/T3 and once for T2.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when
Cell 2 does not exist during T1/T3.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell M6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell M11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell M12.
#### 5.8A.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.8A.5.1 to predict the overall effect
on the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T1/T3 and for T2.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, and 17 on the
_Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to
each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause
5.8A.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test
system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns R and V as the most realistic model, but is the
same as root-sum-squares combination for these tests because no adverse
effects of correlation are envisaged. This is consistent with the assumptions
given in clause 5.8A.4.
#### 5.8A.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_
sheet is used to calculate the nominal powers for each cell, but no
uncertainties are applied, so it generates the same values as the _Original_
sheet.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to G35 of the _Apply uncertainties \--
Find Ior_ sheet, and are carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.8A.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell K24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.8A.5.6.
#### 5.8A.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell K24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2 is
--14.00dB as shown in cell G20, but it may be as high as --13.76dB (cell G21)
or as low as --14.24dB (cell G22). The high and low values are obtained by
simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.8A.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low)
values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset,
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause 5.8A.2 a).
An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been
added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.7 dB in cell K24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
### 5.8A.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.5A.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --12.93dB and --12.50dB at T1/T3
and T2 respectively, which comply with the requirement of -13dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell G22 gives --13.54dB at T2, which complies with the
requirement of -14dB for Cell 2.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E25 gives a difference of -1.33dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 1.5dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy) the lowest reported value would be \--2.83dB, which complies with
the requirement of -3dB during time T2.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T3 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell D24 gives a difference of -87dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Although this is only calculated as a
nominal figure which is dependent on the "-99.99" number entered in cell F18
of the _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet , it clearly complies with the
requirement of -3dB during time T3.
d) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D27 and E27 give nominal Io values of \--66.99dBm
and --60.00dBm at T1/T3 and T2 respectively, which are within 0.03dB of the
stated values of --66.98dBm and --60.03dBm.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G13 show that the channel power ratios of
all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are increased by
the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is subject to the
same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to comply under
guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall below the stated
Ec/Io ratio.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
## 5.9 Test 8.6.1.2 Event triggered reporting of multiple neighbours in AWGN
propagation condition (R99)
### 5.9.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3]
tables 8.6.1.2.1 and 8.6.1.2.3.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up are:
\- T1 and T2 have the same cell conditions.
\- T4 and T5 have the same cell conditions.
\- The overall power within the radio channel changes between T0, T1/T2, T3,
T4/T5 and T6, so the pies are different sizes.
\- The cells change in absolute power between time periods.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T0 and during T1/T2, and only appears during
T3, T4/T5 and T6.
\- Cell 3 does not exist during T0 and during T4/T5, and only appears during
T1/T2, T3 and T6.
\- The noise remains the same absolute power during all the time periods, but
changes as a fraction of the overall power.
### 5.9.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T1 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
c) With the value of W=0, the value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to the best
of Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and Cell 3 CPICH Ec/Io as measured by the UE during time
T3 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting range. The
requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency
relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A (A Primary CPICH
enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
d) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T3 shall not be less than 0 dB, the value of the
replacement activation threshold. The requirement shall include the effect of
UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure
that Event 1C (A non-active primary CPICH becomes better than an active
primary CPICH) occurs for Cell 2.
e) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
f) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T6 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
g) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
h) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
i) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.9.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Cell 1 has been chosen as the reference, and has its power specified as an
absolute accuracy. Cell 2 and Cell 3 are specified relative to the reference
cell.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
##### During T1/T2, T3 and T6: {#during-t1t2-t3-and-t6 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (3) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
##### During T3, T4/T5 and T6: {#during-t3-t4t5-and-t6 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
##### During T0 to T6: {#during-t0-to-t6 .H6}
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.9.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) The relative uncertainties for Ior(n) across different cells may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
e) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(1) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
f) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(1) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(2,
3), are uncorrelated to each other.
### 5.9.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.6.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.9.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.9.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for Cell 1 at T6 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell AL32 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$L\$31*\$M\$31)/(\$L\$31+\$V\$31+\$AF\$31+AL\$31))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 3 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The \$_L\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T6,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$M\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --15.50000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell AL33 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$L\$31*\$M\$31)/(\$L\$31+\$V\$31+\$AF\$31+AL\$31*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --15.50069dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.069, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell AL11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.069, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 7 contributing uncertainties for this test is treated the same way
by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then copied into
the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed
in column A. Because the conditions at T0, T1/T2, T3, T4/T5 and T6 are
different, the process is carried out five times: once for each time interval.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when
Cell 2 does not exist during T0.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell AL6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell AL11 in this example, to give the resultant
uncertainty in cell AL12.
#### 5.9.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.9.5.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in rows 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T0, T1/T2, T3, T4/T5 and T6.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26
on the _Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its
sensitivity to each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were
obtained in clause 5.9.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal
figures. Each test system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant
sensitivity, to give the individual effect on each critical parameter at the
UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns AN to AR as the most realistic model for this
test, and is consistent with the assumptions given in clause 5.9.4. Note that
the correct way to calculate the _Combi_ sum depends on whether correlation
has an adverse or a beneficial effect on the result.
#### 5.9.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Original_ sheet is used to
calculate the nominal powers for each cell. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet is not used.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to R35 of the _Original_ sheet, and are
carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.9.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell M24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.9.5.6.
#### 5.9.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell M24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T3 is
--13.50dB as shown in cell K20, but it may be as high as --13.23dB (cell K21)
or as low as --13.77dB (cell K22). The high and low values are obtained by
simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.9.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1,2 and 3 were not given an
offset. Comparing the Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with
no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause
5.9.2 a). An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1, 2 and 3 has
therefore been added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.7 dB in cell M24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell M25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1, 2 and 3 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1, Cell 2 and
Cell 3 correct.
### 5.9.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.6. References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22, E22, F22, G22, and H22 give --12.93dB,
\--12.50dB, --15.54dB, --13.52dB and --15.04dB at T0, T1/T2, T3, T4/T5 and T6
respectively, which comply with the requirements of -13dB, -13dB, -16dB, -14dB
and --15.5dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells K22, L22, and M22 give --13.07dB, --12.51dB and
--13.59dB at T3, T4/T5 and T6 respectively, which comply with the requirements
of --13.5dB, -13dB and --14dB for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells O22, P22, and R22 give --13.54dB, --15.68dB and
--15.67dB at T1/T2, T3 and T6 respectively, which comply with the requirements
of --14dB, -16dB and --16dB for Cell 3.
b) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T1 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E28 gives a difference of -1.33dB for Cell 3
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 1.5dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy for both Cell 3 and Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io >-14dB) the lowest reported
value would be --2.83dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during
time T1.
c) With the value of W=0, the value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to the best
of Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and Cell 3 CPICH Ec/Io as measured by the UE during time
T3 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting range. The
requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency
relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A (A Primary CPICH
enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F25 gives a difference of +2.17dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 2.0dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest reported value would be
+0.17dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during time T3. Taking
the negative of Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F30 gives a difference of +2.05dB
for Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a
further 2.0dB low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative
measurement accuracy with Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest reported value
would be +0.05dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during time T3.
d) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T3 shall not be less than 0 dB, the value of the
replacement activation threshold. The requirement shall include the effect of
UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure
that Event 1C (A non-active primary CPICH becomes better than an active
primary CPICH) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F25 gives a difference of +2.17dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 2.0dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest reported value would be
+0.17dB, which complies with the requirement of 0dB during time T3.
e) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells G27 and G28 give a difference of -86dB for Cell 3
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Although this is only calculated as a
nominal figure, it clearly complies with the requirement of less than -3dB
during time T4/T5.
f) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T6 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell H28 gives a difference of -0.83dB for Cell 3
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 2.0dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest reported value would be
--2.83dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during time T6.
g) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D33, E33, F33, G33, and H33 give nominal Io
values of --81.99dBm, --75.00dBm, --72.10dBm, --75.00dBm and --73.40dBm at T0,
T1/T2, T3, T4/T5 and T6 respectively, which are within 0.03dB of the stated
values of --81.98dBm, --75.03dBm, --72.07dBm, --75.03dBm and \--73.38dBm.
h) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to R13 and D14 to H14 show that the channel
power ratios of all the other channels for Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 (except
OCNS) are increased by the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at
the UE is subject to the same influences as the CPICH, which has already been
shown to comply under guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not
fall below the stated Ec/Io ratio.
i) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
## 5.9A Test 8.6.1.2A Event triggered reporting of multiple neighbours in AWGN
propagation condition (Rel-4 and later)
### 5.9A.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3]
tables 8.6.1.2A.1 and 8.6.1.2A.3.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
{width="3.3361111111111112in" height="3.0in"}
The main points to note about the cell set-up are:
\- The overall power within the radio channel changes between T0, T1, T2, T3
and T4, so the pies are different sizes.
\- The cells change in absolute power between time periods.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T0 and during T1, and only appears during T2,
T3 and T4.
\- Cell 3 does not exist during T0 and during T3, and only appears during T1,
T2 and T4.
\- The noise remains the same absolute power during all the time periods, but
changes as a fraction of the overall power.
### 5.9A.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T1 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
d) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than 0 dB, the value of the
replacement activation threshold. The requirement shall include the effect of
UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure
that Event 1C (A non-active primary CPICH becomes better than an active
primary CPICH) occurs for Cell 2.
e) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T3 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
f) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
g) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
h) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
i) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.9A.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Cell 1 has been chosen as the reference, and has its power specified as an
absolute accuracy. Cell 2 and Cell 3 are specified relative to the reference
cell.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
##### During T1, T2 and T4: {#during-t1-t2-and-t4 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (3) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
##### During T2, T3 and T4: {#during-t2-t3-and-t4 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
##### During T0 to T4: {#during-t0-to-t4 .H6}
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.9A.4 Assumptions
Same as defined for test 8.6.1.2 in clause 5.9.4.
### 5.9A.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.6A.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.9A.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.9A.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for Cell 1 at T4 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell AL32 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$L\$31*\$M\$31)/(\$L\$31+\$V\$31+\$AF\$31+AL\$31))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 3 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The \$_L\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T4,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$M\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --15.50000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell AL33 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$L\$31*\$M\$31)/(\$L\$31+\$V\$31+\$AF\$31+AL\$31*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --15.50069dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.069, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell AL11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.069, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 7 contributing uncertainties for this test is treated the same way
by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then copied into
the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed
in column A. Because the conditions at T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 are different,
the process is carried out five times: once for each time interval.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when
Cell 2 does not exist during T0.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell AL6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell AL11 in this example, to give the resultant
uncertainty in cell AL12.
#### 5.9A.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.9A.5.1 to predict the overall effect
on the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in rows 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26
on the _Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its
sensitivity to each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were
obtained in clause 5.9A.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal
figures. Each test system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant
sensitivity, to give the individual effect on each critical parameter at the
UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns AN to AR as the most realistic model for this
test, and is consistent with the assumptions given in clause 5.9A.4. Note that
the correct way to calculate the _Combi_ sum depends on whether correlation
has an adverse or a beneficial effect on the result.
#### 5.9A.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Original_ sheet is used to
calculate the nominal powers for each cell. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet is not used.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to R35 of the _Original_ sheet, and are
carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.9A.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell M24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.9A.5.6.
#### 5.9A.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell M24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2 is
--13.50dB as shown in cell K20, but it may be as high as --13.23dB (cell K21)
or as low as --13.77dB (cell K22). The high and low values are obtained by
simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.9A.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1,2 and 3 were not given an
offset. Comparing the Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with
no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause
5.9A.2 a). An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1, 2 and 3 has
therefore been added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.7 dB in cell M24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell M25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1, 2 and 3 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1, Cell 2 and
Cell 3 correct.
### 5.9A.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.6A.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22, E22, F22, G22, and H22 give --12.93dB,
\--12.50dB, --15.54dB, --13.52dB and --15.04dB at T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4
respectively, which comply with the requirements of -13dB, -13dB, -16dB, -14dB
and --15.5dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells K22, L22, and M22 give --13.07dB, --12.51dB and
--13.59dB at T2, T3 and T4 respectively, which comply with the requirements of
--13.5dB, -13dB and --14dB for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells O22, P22, and R22 give --13.54dB, --15.68dB and
--15.67dB at T1, T2 and T4 respectively, which comply with the requirements of
--14dB, -16dB and --16dB for Cell 3.
b) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T1 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E28 gives a difference of -1.33dB for Cell 3
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 1.5dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy for both Cell 3 and Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io >-14dB) the lowest reported
value would be --2.83dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during
time T1.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F25 gives a difference of +2.17dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 2.0dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest reported value would be
+0.17dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during time T2.
d) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than 0 dB, the value of the
replacement activation threshold. The requirement shall include the effect of
UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure
that Event 1C (A non-active primary CPICH becomes better than an active
primary CPICH) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F25 gives a difference of +2.17dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 2.0dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest reported value would be
+0.17dB, which complies with the requirement of 0dB during time T2.
e) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T3 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells G27 and G28 give a difference of -86dB for Cell 3
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Although this is only calculated as a
nominal figure, it clearly complies with the requirement of less than -3dB
during time T3.
f) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell H28 gives a difference of -0.83dB for Cell 3
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 2.0dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest reported value would be
--2.83dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during time T4.
g) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D33, E33, F33, G33, and H33 give nominal Io
values of --81.99dBm, --75.00dBm, --72.10dBm, --75.00dBm and --73.40dBm at T0,
T1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively, which are within 0.03dB of the stated values
of --81.98dBm, --75.03dBm, --72.07dBm, --75.03dBm and \--73.38dBm.
h) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to R13 and D14 to H14 show that the channel
power ratios of all the other channels for Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 (except
OCNS) are increased by the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at
the UE is subject to the same influences as the CPICH, which has already been
shown to comply under guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not
fall below the stated Ec/Io ratio.
i) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
## 5.10 Test 8.6.1.3 Event triggered reporting of two detectable neighbours in
AWGN propagation condition (R99)
### 5.10.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3]
tables 8.6.1.3.1 and 8.6.1.3.3.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
{width="3.504861111111111in" height="3.05625in"}
The main points to note about the cell set-up are:
\- T2 and T3 have the same cell conditions.
\- The overall power within the radio channel changes between T0, T1, T2/T3,
T4 and T5, so the pies are different sizes.
\- The cells change in absolute power between time periods.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T0 and during T1, and only appears during
T2/T3, T4 and T5.
\- Cell 3 does not exist during T0 and only appears during T1, T2/ T3, T4 and
T5.
\- The noise remains the same absolute power during all the time periods, but
changes as a fraction of the overall power.
### 5.10.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
c) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
d) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T5 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
e) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
f) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
g) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.10.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Cell 1 has been chosen as the reference, and has its power specified as an
absolute accuracy. Cell 2 and Cell 3 are specified relative to the reference
cell.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
During T1, T2/T3, T4 and T5:
Level uncertainty of Ior (3) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
During T2/T3, T4, and T5:
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
During T0 to T5:
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.10.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) The relative uncertainties for Ior(n) across different cells may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
e) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(1) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
f) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(1) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(2,
3), are uncorrelated to each other.
### 5.10.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.7.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.10.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.10.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for Cell 1 at T5 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell AL32 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$L\$31*\$M\$31)/(\$L\$31+\$V\$31+\$AF\$31+AL\$31))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 3 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The \$_L\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T5,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$M\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --13.00000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell AL33 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$L\$31*\$M\$31)/(\$L\$31+\$V\$31+\$AF\$31+AL\$31*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --13.30001dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.001, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell AL11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.001, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 7 contributing uncertainties for this test is treated the same way
by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then copied into
the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed
in column A. Because the conditions at T0, T1, T2/T3, T4 and T5 are different,
the process is carried out five times: once for each time interval.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when
Cell 2 does not exist during T0.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell AL6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell AL11 in this example, to give the resultant
uncertainty in cell AL12.
#### 5.10.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.10.5.1 to predict the overall effect
on the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in rows 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T0, T1, T2/T3, T4, and T5.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26
on the _Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its
sensitivity to each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were
obtained in clause 5.10.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal
figures. Each test system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant
sensitivity, to give the individual effect on each critical parameter at the
UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns AN to AR as the most realistic model for this
test, and is consistent with the assumptions given in clause 5.10.4. Note that
the correct way to calculate the _Combi_ sum depends on whether correlation
has an adverse or a beneficial effect on the result.
#### 5.10.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Original_ sheet is used to
calculate the nominal powers for each cell. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet is not used.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to R35 of the _Original_ sheet, and are
carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.10.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell M24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.10.5.6.
#### 5.10.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell M24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T3 is
--14.00dB as shown in cell K20, but it may be as high as --13.77dB (cell K21)
or as low as --14.23dB (cell K22). The high and low values are obtained by
simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.10.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1,2 and 3 were not given an
offset. Comparing the Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with
no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause
5.10.2 a). An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1, 2 and 3 has
therefore been added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.4 dB in cell M24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell M25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1, 2 and 3 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1, Cell 2 and
Cell 3 correct.
### 5.10.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.7. References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22, E22, F22, G22, and H22 give --10.86dB,
\--10.72dB, --12.78dB, --14.31dB and --12.78dB at T0, T1, T2/T3, T4 and T5
respectively, which comply with the requirements of -11dB, -11dB, -13dB,
-14.50dB and -13.00dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells K22, L22, and M22 give --13.83dB, --14.92dB and
--20.00dB at T2/T3, T4 and T5 respectively, which comply with the requirements
of --14dB, -15dB and --20dB for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells O22, P22, Q22 and R22 give --17.37dB, \--20.00dB,
--14.92dB and -13.83dB at T1, T2/T3, T4 and T5 respectively, which comply with
the requirements of --17.50dB, -20dB, -15dB and --14dB for Cell 3.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F25 gives a difference of -1.33dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 1.5dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy for both Cell 2 and Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io >-14dB) the lowest reported
value would be --2.83dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during
time T2.
c) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell G28 gives a difference of -0.83dB for Cell 3
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 2.0dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest reported value would be
--2.83dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during time T4.
d) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T5 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells H24 give a difference of -6.67dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 3.0dB
high (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io >-20dB) the highest reported value would be
--3.67dB, which complies with the requirement of less than -3dB during time
T5.
e) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D33, E33, F33, G33, and H33 give nominal Io
values of --78.11dBm, --69.40dBm, --53.50dBm, --66.00dBm and --53.50dBm at T0,
T1, T2/T3, T4 and T5 respectively, which are within 0.05dB of the stated
values of --78.13dBm, --69.45dBm, --53.49dBm, --66.05dBm and \--53.49dBm.
f) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to R13 and D14 to H14 show that the channel
power ratios of all the other channels for Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 (except
OCNS) are increased by the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at
the UE is subject to the same influences as the CPICH, which has already been
shown to comply under guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not
fall below the stated Ec/Io ratio.
g) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
## 5.10A Test 8.6.1.3A Event triggered reporting of two detectable neighbours
in AWGN propagation condition (Rel-4 and later)
### 5.10A.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3]
tables 8.6.1.3A.1 and 8.6.1.3A.3.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
{width="2.4805555555555556in" height="2.0791666666666666in"}
The main points to note about the cell set-up are:
\- The overall power within the radio channel changes between T0, T1, T2, T3
and T4, so the pies are different sizes.
\- The cells change in absolute power between time periods.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T0 and during T1, and only appears during T2,
T3 and T4.
\- Cell 3 does not exist during T0, and only appears during T1, T2, T3 and T4.
\- The noise remains the same absolute power during all the time periods, but
changes as a fraction of the overall power.
### 5.10A.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
c) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T3 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
d) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
e) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
f) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
g) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.10A.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Cell 1 has been chosen as the reference, and has its power specified as an
absolute accuracy. Cell 2 and Cell 3 are specified relative to the reference
cell.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
During T1, T2, T3 and T4:
Level uncertainty of Ior (3) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
During T2, T3 and T4:
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
During T0 to T4:
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.10A.4 Assumptions
Same as defined for test 8.6.1.3 in clause 5.10.4.
### 5.10A.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.7A.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.10A.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.10A.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for Cell 1 at T4 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell AL32 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$L\$31*\$M\$31)/(\$L\$31+\$V\$31+\$AF\$31+AL\$31))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 3 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The \$_L\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T4,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$M\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --13.00000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell AL33 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$L\$31*\$M\$31)/(\$L\$31+\$V\$31+\$AF\$31+AL\$31*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --13.00001dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.001, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell AL11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.001, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 7 contributing uncertainties for this test is treated the same way
by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then copied into
the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed
in column A. Because the conditions at T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 are different,
the process is carried out five times: once for each time interval.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when
Cell 2 does not exist during T0.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell AL6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell AL11 in this example, to give the resultant
uncertainty in cell AL12.
#### 5.10A.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.10A.5.1 to predict the overall effect
on the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in rows 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26
on the _Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its
sensitivity to each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were
obtained in clause 5.10A.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal
figures. Each test system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant
sensitivity, to give the individual effect on each critical parameter at the
UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns AN to AR as the most realistic model for this
test, and is consistent with the assumptions given in clause 5.10A.4. Note
that the correct way to calculate the _Combi_ sum depends on whether
correlation has an adverse or a beneficial effect on the result.
#### 5.10A.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Original_ sheet is used to
calculate the nominal powers for each cell. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet is not used.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to R35 of the _Original_ sheet, and are
carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.10A.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH
offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell M24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.10A.5.6.
#### 5.10A.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell M24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2 is
--14.00dB as shown in cell K20, but it may be as high as --13.77dB (cell K21)
or as low as --14.23dB (cell K22). The high and low values are obtained by
simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.10A.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1,2 and 3 were not given an
offset. Comparing the Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with
no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause
5.10A.2 a). An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1, 2 and 3 has
therefore been added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.4 dB in cell M24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell M25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1, 2 and 3 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1, Cell 2 and
Cell 3 correct.
### 5.10A.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.7A.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22, E22, F22, G22, and H22 give --10.86dB,
\--10.72dB, --12.78dB, --14.31dB and --12.78dB at T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4
respectively, which comply with the requirements of -11dB, -11dB, -13dB,
-14.50dB and -13.00dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells K22, L22, and M22 give --13.83dB, --14.92dB and
--20dB at T2, T3 and T4 respectively, which comply with the requirements of
--14dB, -15dB and --20dB for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells O22, P22, Q22 and R22 give --17.37dB, \--20.00dB,
--14.92dB and -13.83dB at T1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively, which comply with
the requirements of --17.50dB, -20dB, -15dB and --14dB for Cell 3.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F25 gives a difference of -1.33dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 1.5dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy for both Cell 2 and Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io >-14dB) the lowest reported
value would be --2.83dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during
time T2.
c) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T3 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell G28 gives a difference of -0.83dB for Cell 3
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 2.0dB
low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest reported value would be
--2.83dB, which complies with the requirement of -3dB during time T3.
d) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T4 shall be less than -3 dB, the value of the reporting
range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1B (A
Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell H24 gives a difference of -6.67dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. Even if the UE reports this a further 3.0dB
high (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement
accuracy with Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io >-20dB) the highest reported value would be
--3.67dB, which complies with the requirement of less than -3dB during time
T4.
e) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D33, E33, F33, G33, and H33 give nominal Io
values of --78.11dBm, --69.40dBm, --53.50dBm, --66.00dBm and --53.50dBm at T0,
T1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively, which are within 0.05dB of the stated values
of --78.13dBm, --69.45dBm, --53.49dBm, --66.05dBm and \--53.49dBm.
f) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to R13 and D14 to H14 show that the channel
power ratios of all the other channels for Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 (except
OCNS) are increased by the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at
the UE is subject to the same influences as the CPICH, which has already been
shown to comply under guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not
fall below the stated Ec/Io ratio.
g) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.

condition (R99)
[FFS].
## 5.11A Test 8.6.1.4A Correct reporting of neighbours in fading propagation
condition (Rel-4 and later)
### 5.11A.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.6.1.4.2.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up are:
\- The overall power within the radio channel is the same for T1 and T2, so
the pies are the same size.
\- Cell 1 is bigger in absolute power during T1 compared to its value in T2.
\- Cell 2 is bigger in absolute power during T2 compared to its value in T1.
\- The noise remains the same absolute power from T1 to T2.
### 5.11A.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T1 shall be lower than -4 dB. This will ensure that
Event 1A (A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) does not occur more
frequently because of the test system.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than 4 dB. This will ensure that
Event 1B (A Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) does not occur more
frequently because of the test system.
d) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.11A.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Cell 1 has been chosen as the reference, and has its power specified as an
absolute accuracy. Cell 2 is specified relative to the reference cell.
The noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is because it has a
different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured using different
equipment.
##### During T1 and T2: {#during-t1-and-t2-1 .H6}
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.11A.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(n) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
e) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(1) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(2),
are uncorrelated to each other.
### 5.11A.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.8A.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.11A.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.11A.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T2 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell M24 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((\$F\$23*\$G\$23)/(\$F\$23+\$J\$23+\$M\$23))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 2 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$F\$23_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T2,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$G\$23_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --16.00000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell M25 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$23*\$G\$23)/(\$F\$23+\$J\$23+\$M\$23*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --16.00118 dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.118, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell M11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.118 is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 5 contributing uncertainties on the one-frequency test is treated
the same way by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then
copied into the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE
parameter listed in column A. Because the conditions at T1 and T2 are
different, the process is carried out twice: once for T1 and once for T2.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell M6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell M11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell M12.
#### 5.11A.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.11A.5.1 to predict the overall effect
on the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T1 and for T2.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, and 17 on the
_Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to
each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause
5.11A.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test
system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns R and V as the most realistic model, but is the
same as root-sum-squares combination for these tests because no adverse
effects of correlation are envisaged. This is consistent with the assumptions
given in clause 5.11A.4.
#### 5.11A.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Original_ sheet is used to
calculate the nominal powers for each cell. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet is not used.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to G35 of the _Original_ sheet, and are
carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.11A.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cells K24 and M24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet,
but is modified later in clause 5.11A.5.6.
#### 5.11A.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cells K24 and M24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io
at T1 is --16.00dB as shown in cell F20, but it may be as high as --15.71dB
(cell F21) or as low as --16.28dB (cell F22). The high and low values are
obtained by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set
value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.11A.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low)
values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset,
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause 5.11A.2 a).
In addition, the difference between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
would fall outside the limits specified in clause 5.11A.2 b) and c). An offset
to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been added in
the _Error analysis_ sheet, with different values allowed for Cell 1 and Cell
2 at T1 and T2. However, since Cell 1 and Cell 2 reverse their relative
strengths between T1 and T2, only two independent values need be used.
A value of +0.3 dB in cell M24 ensures that the CPICH_Ec/Io values for Cell 1
at T2 and Cell 2 at T1 do not fall below their original value, and a value of
+0.7 dB in cell K24 ensures that the difference between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io is at least the original value. Cells N24 and L24 copy the
values to meet the equivalent requirements under the remaining test
conditions.
Similar offsets in cells K25 to N25 are applied to the other specified
channels on Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code
channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
### 5.11A.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.8A References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --11.49 dB and --15.96 dB at T1
and T2 respectively, which comply with the requirement of --12 dB and --16 dB
for Cell 1 at T1 and T2 respectively.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells F22 and G22 give --15.98 dB and --11.51 dB at T1
and T2 respectively, which comply with the requirement of --16dB and --12 dB
for Cell 2 at T1 and T2 respectively.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T1 shall be lower than --4 dB. This will ensure that
Event 1A (A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) does not occur more
frequently because of the test system.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell D24 gives a difference of --4.07 dB at T1 for Cell
2 CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. This complies with the requirement of -4dB
during time T1.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than 4 dB. This will ensure that
Event 1B (A Primary CPICH leaves the reporting range) does not occur more
frequently because of the test system.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E25 gives a difference of +4.07 dB at T2 for Cell
2 CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. This complies with the requirement of 4dB
during time T2.
d) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D27 and E27 give nominal Io values of \--60.70dBm
and --60.70dBm at T1 and T2 respectively, which are within 0.01dB of the
stated values of --60.71dBm and --60.71dBm.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G13 and D14 to E14 show that the channel
power ratios of all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are
increased by the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is
subject to the same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to
comply under guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall
below the stated Ec/Io ratio.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
## 5.12 Test 8.6.1.5 Event triggered reporting of multiple neighbour cells in
Case 1 fading conditions
### 5.12.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3]
tables 8.6.1.5.2 and 8.6.1.5.3.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up are:
\- The overall power within the radio channel changes between T1 and T2, so
the pies are different sizes.
\- The cells change in absolute power between time periods.
\- Cell 1 does not exist during T1, and only appears during T2.
\- The noise remains the same absolute power during all the time periods, but
changes as a fraction of the overall power.
### 5.12.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 shall not
fall below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE
from entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.12.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 have been chosen as the reference, and has its power
specified as an absolute accuracy. Cell 1 is specified relative to the
reference cell.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
**During T1 and T2:**
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
**During T1 and T2:**
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.12.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) The relative uncertainties for Ior(n) across different cells may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
e) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(1) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
f) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(1) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(2),
are uncorrelated to each other.
### 5.12.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.9.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.12.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.12.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for Cell 1 at T2 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell U44 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$43*\$G\$43)/(\$F\$43+\$J\$41+\$N\$43+R\$43))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 3 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The \$_F\$43_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T2,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$G\$43_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --17.60000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell U45 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$31*\$G\$31)/(\$F\$31+\$J\$31+\$N\$31+R\$31*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --17.60132dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.132, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell AL11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.132, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 7 contributing uncertainties for this test is treated the same way
by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then copied into
the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed
in column A. Because the conditions at T1 and T2 are different, the process is
carried out five times: once for each time interval.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell U6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell U11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell U12.
#### 5.12.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.12.5.1 to predict the overall effect
on the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 1 cell, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in rows 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T1and T2.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26,
29, 32, 35 and 38 on the _Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure
for its sensitivity to each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities
were obtained in clause 5.12.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the
nominal figures. Each test system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant
sensitivity, to give the individual effect on each critical parameter at the
UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns W to X as the most realistic model for this test,
and is consistent with the assumptions given in clause 5.12.4. Note that the
correct way to calculate the _Combi_ sum depends on whether correlation has an
adverse or a beneficial effect on the result.
#### 5.12.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Original_ sheet is used to
calculate the nominal powers for each cell. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet is not used.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to K35 of the _Original_ sheet, and are
carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.12.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 CPICH
offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell J24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.12.5.6.
#### 5.12.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell J24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2 is
--16.90dB as shown in cell K20, but it may be as high as --16.73dB (cell K21)
or as low as --17.07dB (cell K22). The high and low values are obtained by
simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.12.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 CPICH
offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1, 2, 3 and 4 were not given an
offset. Comparing the Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with
no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause
5.12.2 a). An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1, 2, 3, and 4
has therefore been added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.7 dB in cell J24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell J25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1, 2, 3 and 4 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell
3 and Cell 4 correct.
### 5.12.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.9. References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 shall not
fall below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE
from entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells E22 give --17.11dB at T2 respectively, which
comply with the requirements of -17.60dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells F22 and G22 give --14.07dB and --17.07dB at T1and
T2 respectively, which comply with the requirements of --14.6dB and --17.60dB
for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells H22, and I22 give --14.06dB and --17.12dB at T1
and T2 respectively, which comply with the requirements of \--14.60dB and
--17.60dB for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells J22 and K22 give --17.03dB and --14.12dB at T1
and T2 respectively, which comply with the requirements of --17.60dB, and
--14.60dB for Cell 4.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -1dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F25 gives a difference of -0.17dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. This complies with the requirement of -1dB
during time T2.
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells E45 give nominal Io values of --61.20dBm at T2
respectively, which are within 0.03dB of the stated values of \--61.23dBm.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to K13 and D14 to E14 show that the channel
power ratios of all the other channels for Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4
(except OCNS) are increased by the same amount as the CPICH. As their
variability at the UE is subject to the same influences as the CPICH, which
has already been shown to comply under guideline a), the other channels
(except OCNS) will not fall below the stated Ec/Io ratio.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
## 5.13 Test 8.6.1.6 Event triggered reporting of multiple neighbour cells in
Case 3 fading conditions
### 5.13.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3]
tables 8.6.1.6.1 and 8.6.1.6.3.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up are:
\- The overall power within the radio channel changes between T1 and T2, so
the pies are different sizes.
\- The cells change in absolute power between time periods.
\- Cell 1 does not exist during T1, and only appears during T2.
\- The noise remains the same absolute power during all the time periods, but
changes as a fraction of the overall power.
### 5.13.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test

b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -3 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than 0 dB, the value of the
replacement activation threshold. The requirement shall include the effect of
UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure
that Event 1F (A non-active primary CPICH becomes better than an active
primary CPICH) occurs for Cell 2.
d) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 shall not fall below the values implied in the
original table.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 5.13.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 3 have been chosen as the reference, and has its power
specified as an absolute accuracy. Cell 1 is specified relative to the
reference cell.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
**During T1 and T2:**
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
**During T1 and T2:**
CPICH_Ec/Ior (n) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc: +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 5.13.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) The relative uncertainties for Ior(n) across different cells may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
e) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(1) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
f) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(1) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(2),
are uncorrelated to each other.
### 5.13.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.10.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 5.13.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 5.13.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for Cell 1 at T2 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell U44 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$43*\$G\$43)/(\$F\$43+\$J\$41+\$N\$43+R\$43))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers, 3 cells + noise,
> added up as fractions.
>
> \- The \$_F\$43_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T2,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$G\$43_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10 log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case --18.00000dB with
> nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell U45 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$31*\$G\$31)/(\$F\$31+\$J\$31+\$N\$31+R\$31*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --18.00132dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.132, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell AL11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to get the correct value for the sensitivity. This
sensitivity of --0.132, is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 7 contributing uncertainties for this test is treated the same way
by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then copied into
the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed
in column A. Because the conditions at T1 and T2 are different, the process is
carried out five times: once for each time interval.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell U6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell U11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell U12.
#### 5.13.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 5.13.5.1 to predict the overall effect
on the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in rows 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet.
Separate sets of columns are used for T1 and T2.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26,
29, 32, 35 and 38 on the _Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure
for its sensitivity to each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities
were obtained in clause 5.13.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the
nominal figures. Each test system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant
sensitivity, to give the individual effect on each critical parameter at the
UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns W to X as the most realistic model for this test,
and is consistent with the assumptions given in clause 5.13.4. Note that the
correct way to calculate the _Combi_ sum depends on whether correlation has an
adverse or a beneficial effect on the result.
#### 5.13.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Original_ sheet is used to
calculate the nominal powers for each cell. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet is not used.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to K35 of the _Original_ sheet, and are
carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 5.13.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 CPICH
offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell J24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 5.13.5.6.
#### 5.13.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell J24 set to 0, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2 is
--13.80dB as shown in cell K20, but it may be as high as --13.63dB (cell K21)
or as low as --13.97dB (cell K22). The high and low values are obtained by
simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 5.13.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 CPICH
offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1, 2, 3 and 4 were not given an
offset. Comparing the Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with
no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause
5.13.2 a). An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1, 2, 3 and 4 has
therefore been added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.7 dB in cell J24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell J25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1, 2, 3 and 4 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell
3 and Cell 4 correct.
### 5.13.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.1.10.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4 shall not
fall below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE
from entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells E22 give --17.51dB at T2 respectively, which
comply with the requirements of -18.00dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells F22 and G22 give --15.96dB and --13.97dB at T1and
T2 respectively, which comply with the requirements of --16.50dB and --14.50dB
for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells H22, and I22 give --15.93dB and --14.02dB at T1
and T2 respectively, which comply with the requirements of \--16.50dB and
--14.50dB for Cell 3.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells J22 give --12.92dB at T1 respectively, which
comply with the requirements of --13.50dB for Cell 4.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than 4dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F25 gives a difference of 3.67dB for Cell 2
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io. This complies with the requirement of 4dB
during time T2.
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells E45 give nominal Io values of --61.20dBm at T2
respectively, which are within 0.03dB of the stated values of \--61.23dBm.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to K13 and D14 to E14 show that the channel
power ratios of all the other channels for Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4
(except OCNS) are increased by the same amount as the CPICH. As their
variability at the UE is subject to the same influences as the CPICH, which
has already been shown to comply under guideline a), the other channels
(except OCNS) will not fall below the stated Ec/Io ratio.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
# 6 Two frequency multi-cell FDD tests
For the two-frequency tests one or more cells are on one carrier, and one or
more cells are on another carrier. The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio, as seen by the UE
receiver, is determined therefore only by the cells and noise on that
frequency channel. Two separate calculations are made to derive the
CPICH_Ec/Io ratio, one for each frequency channel.
## 6.1 Test 8.2.2.2 Cell reselection in idle mode, two frequencies
### 6.1.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.2.2.2.2.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up for a two-frequency test are:
\- The overall power within each radio channel changes between T1 and T2, so
the pies are different sizes.
\- The noise is a significant fraction of the overall power.
\- Cells 1 and 2 change both in absolute power, and as a fraction of the
overall power, from T1 to T2.
\- Cells 3 to 6 remain the same as a fraction of the overall power from T1 to
T2, but their absolute power changes.
### 6.1.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The worst-case difference during time T1 between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
c) The worst-case difference during time T2 between Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
d) In order to ensure the geometry factors Îor/Ioc remain centred on the
values stated in the original table, the nominal Io for channel 1 and channel
2 stated in the original table shall not be modified.
e) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3 through 6 shall not be higher than
the value stated in the original table. This will prevent the interfering
cells from having a larger impact on the test than originally intended.
f) Provided guideline e) is met first, the worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3
through 6 shall not fall below the CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range of --24 dB.
g) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
h) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 6.1.3 Uncertainty parameter set
A parameter set is defined for each channel present. In the two frequency
tests the Ior(n) levels for both channels change from T1 to T2. Since the UE
is set to use CPICH_Ec/No as a quality measure for cell reselection, and
CPICH_Ec/No is measured within the channel bandwidth, the quantity to be
controlled is CPICH_Ec/Io. The overall Io level of channel 1 relative to
channel 2 is not important, nor is the overall Io level of channel 1 or 2 at
T1 relative to the same channel at T2.
The parameter set therefore sets the tightest constraints on the relative
levels of the cells, within each channel, for each time period. The Io levels
of both channels at both time periods are not constrained so tightly.
Within each channel, one cell has been chosen as the reference, and this cell
has its power specified as an absolute accuracy. The other two cells on the
same channel are specified relative to the reference cell for that channel.
The other two cells are not directly specified with respect to each other, as
this would be a redundant constraint.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
The two channels each have their own separate absolute power reference.
##### Channel 1 during T1: {#channel-1-during-t1 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (3, 4) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
##### Channel 1 during T2: {#channel-1-during-t2 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (3, 4) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
##### Channel 1 during T1 and T2: {#channel-1-during-t1-and-t2 .H6}
CPICH_Ec/Ior (1,3,4) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (1): +/-1.0dB
##### Channel 2 during T1: {#channel-2-during-t1 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (5, 6) relative to Ior (2): +/- 0.3dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (2): +/-0.7dB
##### Channel 2 during T2: {#channel-2-during-t2 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (5, 6) relative to Ior (2): +/- 0.3dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (2): +/-0.7dB
##### Channel 2 during T1 and T2: {#channel-2-during-t1-and-t2 .H6}
CPICH_Ec/Ior (2,5,6) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (2): +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 6.1.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) The relative uncertainties for Ior(n) across different cells may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
e) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(n) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
f) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(1) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(3,
4), are uncorrelated to each other. Similarly, the absolute uncertainty of
Ior(2) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(5, 6), are uncorrelated to each
other.
g) The absolute uncertainties for Ior(1) and Ior(2) may have any amount of
positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
h) The absolute uncertainties for Ioc(1) and Ioc(2) may have any amount of
positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).:
### 6.1.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.1.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 6.1.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 6.1.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet. It is necessary to first calculate the sensitivities before entering
the equations in the _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T1 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell P28 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$D\$27*\$E\$27)/(\$P\$27+\$D\$27+\$H\$27+\$J\$27))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers for the cells on
> Channel 1, noise + 3 cells, added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$D\$27_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T1,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$E\$27_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10* log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case \--16.00000dB
> with nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell P29 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$D\$27*\$E\$27)/(\$P\$27*(10\^(0.01/10))+\$D\$27+\$H\$27+\$J\$27))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --16.00549dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.549, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell P11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to give the correct value for the sensitivity. The
sensitivity of --0.549 is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 14 contributing uncertainties for the two-frequency test is
treated the same way by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities
are then applied to the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each
UE parameter listed in column A.
In cases where the value can be deduced as 1.000 or 0 by inspection the
sensitivity is entered directly.
EXAMPLE: Cells on channel 2 do not affect channel 1, so the sensitivity is
entered as 0.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell P6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, Cell P11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell P12.
#### 6.1.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 6.15.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 6 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet. For
this exercise only the Cell levels at T1 are considered, since the outcome at
T2 will be the same but with the effects from cells 1 and 2 reversed.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17, 20 and 23 on
the _Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity
to each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in
clause 6.1.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each
test system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors in
column U has been selected as the most realistic model for these tests, and is
consistent with the assumptions given in clause 6.1.4.
#### 6.1.5.3 Derivation of equations for Ior(n)
The _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet is used. Several strategies are
possible to ensure that the Cell 1/Cell 2 CPICH ratio at least meets the
original value as stated in clauses 6.1.2 b) and 6.1.2 c), and also to keep
the nominal Io(1) and Io(2) values as stated in clause 6.1.2 d). The strategy
taken here is to make no changes to the Cells on Channel 1, but to increase
Ior(2) on channel 2 at the expense of Ioc. The benefits of this approach are:
a) Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io gets bigger, to decrease the Cell 1/Cell 2 CPICH ratio.
b) Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io does not get any smaller, so it does not need a large
CPICH offset in clause 6.1.5.6 to maintain the minimum CPICH_Ec/Io value.
c) The setting of Ior(n) and the CPICH offsets become independent, non-
iterative, steps.
A \"Channel 2 Cell and noise calculator\" is provided on the _Apply
uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet, in rows 37 to 43 and columns G to O. The
calculator is used to decide how much linear power to transfer from Ioc (the
noise) to Cell 2. Using the sensitivities derived in clause 6.1.5.1, which are
applied in cells K42 and N42, we can predict how much extra difference in the
CPICH_Ec/Io value is needed to overcome the variations due to all relevant
uncertainties.
The \"Goal seek\" spreadsheet tool is used to choose a value of cell K39 which
meets the target of --0.78 dB in cell O43. The target value is obtained from
cell V24 on the _Error summation_ sheet.
The Ior(n) and Ioc(m) powers in cells D45 to S45 are then carried forward to
the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 6.1.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell K27 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 6.1.5.6.
#### 6.1.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell K27 set to zero, the set value of Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io at T1
is --16.00dB as shown in cell D20, but it may be as high as \--15.32dB (cell
D21) or as low as --16.68dB (cell D22). The high and low values are obtained
by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 6.1.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the
test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would
fall outside the limit specified in clause 6.1.2 a). An offset to the
CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been added in the
_Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.7 dB in cell K27 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K26 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
#### 6.1.5.7 Determination of Cell 3, Cell 4, Cell 5 and Cell 6 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 3 to 6 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the
test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would
fall outside the limits specified in clauses 6.1.2 e) and 6.1.2 f). An offset
to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratios in Cells 3 to 6 has therefore been added in
the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of -0.8 dB in cell K25 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K24 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 3 to 6 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS increases to keep the overall power of Cells 3 to 6 correct.
### 6.1.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.1 References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --15.98dB and --11.89dB, which
comply with the requirements of -16dB and --13dB for Cell 1 at T1 and T2
respectively.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells F22 and G22 give --11.98dB and --15.98dB, which
comply with the requirements of -13dB and --16dB for Cell 2 at T1 and T2
respectively.
b) The worst-case difference during time T1 between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell D24 gives a difference of -3.01dB for Cell 1
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io, which complies with the requirement of -3dB
during time T1.
c) The worst-case difference during time T2 between Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E25 gives a difference of 3.01dB for Cell 1
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io, which complies with the requirement of 3dB
during time T2.
d) In order to ensure the geometry factors Îor/Ioc remain centred on the
values stated in the original table, the nominal Io for channel 1 and channel
2 stated in the original table shall not be modified.
For channel 1 at T2 and channel 2 at T1, sheet _Error analysis_ cells E28 and
F29 give a nominal Io of --64.79dBm, which within 0.04dB of the stated value
of --64.75dBm.
For channel 1 at T1 and channel 2 at T2, sheet _Error analysis_ cells D28 and
G29 give a nominal Io of --67.40dBm, which is within 0.01dB of the stated
value of --67.39dBm.
e) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3 through 6 shall not be higher than
the value stated in the original table. This will prevent the interfering
cells from having a larger impact on the test than originally intended.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells H21 to O21 all have values in the range
\--20.06dB to --20.33dB, which comply with the requirement of -20dB for Cells
3 to 6.
f) Provided guideline c) is met first, the worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3
through 6 shall not fall below the CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range of --24 dB.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells H22 to O22 all have values in the range
\--21.29dB to --21.55dB, which comply with the requirements of -24dB for Cells
3 to 6.
g) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G13 show that the channel power ratios of
all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are increased by
the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is subject to the
same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to comply under
guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall below the stated
Ec/Io ratio.
h) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
The channel power ratios of all the active channels in Cells 3 to 6 has been
decreased by 0.8dB to meet guideline e). The nominal Ioc for Channel 1 at T2
and Channel 2 at T1 has been changed from --70.0dBm to \--71.8dBm. These
changes will not have any material effect on the test.
## 6.2 Void
## 6.3 Test 8.3.2.2 FDD/FDD Hard Handover to inter-frequency cell
### 6.3.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.3.2.2.2.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up for a two-frequency test are:
\- T2 and T3 have the same cell conditions.
\- Channel 1is unchanged between T1 and T2/T3.
\- For channel 2, the overall power within the radio channel changes between
T1 and T2/T3, so the pies are different sizes.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T1, and only appears during T2/T3.
\- The channel 2 noise remains the same absolute power from T1 to T2, but
becomes a smaller fraction of the overall power.
### 6.3.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured by the UE shall not be less
than -18 dB, the threshold for a non-used frequency. The requirement shall
include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency absolute accuracy. This
will ensure that Event 2C (The estimated quality of a non-used frequency is
above a certain threshold) occurs.
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 6.3.3 Uncertainty parameter set
As there is only one cell for each channel, each cell has its power specified
as an absolute accuracy. The relative power of one cell compared to the other
is not important for this test.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
Channel 1 during T1, T2 and T3:
CPICH_Ec/Ior (1) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (1): +/-1.0dB
Channel 2 during T1:
None apply only during T1
Channel 2 during T2/T3:
CPICH_Ec/Ior (2) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (2): +/-0.7dB
Channel 2 during T1, T2 and T3:
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (2): +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 6.3.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) The uncertainty for Ioc(n) and Ior(n) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
e) The absolute uncertainties for Ior(1) and Ior(2) may have any amount of
positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
f) The absolute uncertainties for Ioc(1) and Ioc(2) may have any amount of
positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).:
### 6.3.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.3.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 6.3.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 6.3.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet. It is necessary to first calculate the sensitivities before entering
the equations in the _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T1 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell L23 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((\$D\$22*\$E\$22)/(\$D\$22+\$L\$22))
> \- The terms in the denominator are the linear powers for the cell and the
> noise on Channel 1, added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$D\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T1,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$E\$22_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10* log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case \--13.00000dB
> with nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell L24 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$D\$22*\$E\$22)/(\$D\$22+\$L\$22*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --13.00499dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.499, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell L11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to give the correct value for the sensitivity. The
sensitivity of --0.499 is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 6 contributing uncertainties on the two-frequency test is treated
the same way by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then
copied into the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each UE
parameter listed in column A, keeping channel 1 and channel 2 separate.
Because the conditions at T1 and T2/T3 are different, the process is carried
out twice: once for T1 and once for T2/T3.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when
Cell 2 does not exist during T1.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell L6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, cell L11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell L12.
#### 6.3.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 6.35.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute levels of the cell on each channel, the
uncertainty in the noise on each channel, and the uncertainty in channel power
ratio, are entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_
sheet. Separate sets of columns are used for T1 and for T2/T3.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11 and 14 on the _Error
summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to each of
the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause 6.3.5.1,
and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test system
uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the individual
effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors
has been selected in columns T and X as the most realistic model, but is the
same as root-sum-squares combination for these tests because no adverse
effects of correlation are envisaged. This is consistent with the assumptions
given in clause 6.3.4.
#### 6.3.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_
sheet is used to calculate the nominal powers for each cell, but no
uncertainties are applied, so it generates the same values as the _Original_
sheet.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D38, E38 and G43 of the _Apply uncertainties
-- Find Ior_ sheet, and are carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet
#### 6.3.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell K24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 6.3.5.6.
#### 6.3.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell K24 set to zero, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at
T2/T3 is --14.00dB as shown in cell G20, but it may be as high as \--13.26dB
(cell G21) or as low as --14.74dB (cell G22). The high and low values are
obtained by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set
value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 6.3.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low)
values with the test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset,
CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall outside the limit specified in clause 6.3.2 a).
An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been
added in the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.8 dB in cell K24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
### 6.3.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.3 References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --12.83dB and --12.83dB at T1
and T2/T3 respectively, which comply with the requirement of -13dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell G22 gives --13.94dB at T2/T3, which complies with
the requirement of -14dB for Cell 2.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured by the UE shall not be less
than -18 dB, the threshold for a non-used frequency. The requirement shall
include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency absolute accuracy. This
will ensure that Event 2C (The estimated quality of a non-used frequency is
above a certain threshold) occurs.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell G22 gives --13.94dB at T2/T3, which already
complies with the requirement of -14dB for Cell 2, and therefore also complies
with the less stringent requirement of --18dB.
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D27 and E27 give nominal Io values of \--66.99dBm
and --66.99dBm for channel 1 at T1 and T2/T3 respectively, which are within
0.01dB of the stated values of --66.98dBm.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells F27 and G27 give nominal Io values of \--70.00dBm
and --67.80dBm for channel 2 at T1 and T2/T3 respectively, which are at the
stated values of --70.00dBm and --67.80dBm.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G13 show that the channel power ratios of
all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are increased by
the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is subject to the
same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to comply under
guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall below the stated
Ec/Io ratio.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
## 6.4 Test 8.3.5.2 Cell reselection in CELL_FACH, two frequencies
### 6.4.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.3.5.2.4.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up for a two-frequency test are:
\- The overall power within each radio channel changes between T1 and T2, so
the pies are different sizes.
\- The noise is a significant fraction of the overall power.
\- Cells 1 and 2 change both in absolute power, and as a fraction of the
overall power, from T1 to T2.
\- Cells 3 to 6 remain the same as a fraction of the overall power from T1 to
T2, but their absolute power changes.
### 6.4.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The worst-case difference during time T1 between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 2 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
c) The worst-case difference during time T2 between Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 2 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
d) In order to ensure the geometry factors Îor/Ioc remain centred on the
values stated in the original table, the nominal Io for channel 1 and channel
2 stated in the original table shall not be modified.
e) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3 through 6 shall not be higher than
the value stated in the original table. This will prevent the interfering
cells from having a larger impact on the test than originally intended.
f) Provided guideline e) is met first, the worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3
through 6 shall not fall below the CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range of --24 dB.
g) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
h) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 6.4.3 Uncertainty parameter set
Same as defined for test 8.2.2.2 in clause 6.1.3.
### 6.4.4 Assumptions
Same as defined for test 8.2.2.2 in clause 6.1.4.
### 6.4.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.4.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 6.4.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 6.2.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet. It is necessary to first calculate the sensitivities before entering
the equations in the _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T1 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell P28 of the _Error summation_
sheet, and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$D\$27*\$E\$27)/(\$P\$27+\$D\$27+\$H\$27+\$J\$27))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers for the cells on
> Channel 1, noise + 3 cells, added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$D\$27_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T1,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$E\$27_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10* log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case \--15.00000dB
> with nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell P29 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$D\$27*\$E\$27)/(\$P\$27*(10\^(0.01/10))+\$D\$27+\$H\$27+\$J\$27))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --15.00484dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.484, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell P11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to give the correct value for the sensitivity. The
sensitivity of --0.484 is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 14 contributing uncertainties for the two-frequency test is
treated the same way by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities
are then applied to the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each
UE parameter listed in column A.
In cases where the value can be deduced as 1.000 or 0 by inspection the
sensitivity is entered directly.
EXAMPLE: Cells on channel 2 do not affect channel 1, so the sensitivity is
entered as 0.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell P6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, Cell P11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell P12.
#### 6.4.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 6.4.5.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 6 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise, and the uncertainty in channel power ratio, are
entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_ sheet. For
this exercise only the Cell levels at T1 are considered, since the outcome at
T2 will be the same but with the effects from cells 1 and 2 reversed.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17, 20 and 23 on
the _Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity
to each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in
clause 6.4.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each
test system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors in
column U has been selected as the most realistic model for these tests, and is
consistent with the assumptions given in clause 6.4.4.
#### 6.4.5.3 Derivation of equations for Ior(n)
The _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet is used. Several strategies are
possible to ensure that the Cell 1/Cell 2 CPICH ratio at least meets the
original value as stated in clauses 6.4.2 b) and 6.4.2 c), and also to keep
the nominal Io(1) and Io(2) values as stated in clause 6.4.2 d). The strategy
taken here is to make no changes to the Cells on Channel 1, but to increase
Ior(2) on channel 2 at the expense of Ioc. The benefits of this approach are:
a) Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io gets bigger, to decrease the Cell 1/Cell 2 CPICH ratio.
b) Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io does not get any smaller, so it does not need a large
CPICH offset in clause 6.4.5.6 to maintain the minimum CPICH_Ec/Io value.
c) The setting of Ior(n) and the CPICH offsets become independent, non-
iterative, steps.
A \"Channel 2 Cell and noise calculator\" is provided on the _Apply
uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet, in rows 37 to 43 and columns G to O. The
calculator is used to decide how much linear power to transfer from Ioc (the
noise) to Cell 2. Using the sensitivities derived in clause 6.4.5.1, which are
applied in cells K42 and N42, we can predict how much extra difference in the
CPICH_Ec/Io value is needed to overcome the variations due to all relevant
uncertainties.
The \"Goal seek\" spreadsheet tool is used to choose a value of cell K39 which
meets the target of --0.71 dB in cell O43. The target value is obtained from
cell V24 on the _Error summation_ sheet.
The Ior(n) and Ioc(m) powers in cells D45 to S45 are then carried forward to
the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 6.4.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell K27 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 6.4.5.6.
#### 6.4.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell K27 set to zero, the set value of Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io at T1
is --14.98dB as shown in cell D20, but it may be as high as \--14.38dB (cell
D21) or as low as --15.58dB (cell D22). The high and low values are obtained
by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 6.4.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the
test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would
fall outside the limit specified in clause 6.4.2 a). An offset to the
CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been added in the
_Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.6 dB in cell K27 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K26 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
#### 6.4.5.7 Determination of Cell 3, Cell 4, Cell 5 and Cell 6 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 3 to 6 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the
test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would
fall outside the limits specified in clauses 6.4.2 e) and 6.4.2 f). An offset
to the CPICH_Ec/Io power ratios in Cells 3 to 6 has therefore been added in
the _Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of -0.7 dB in cell K25 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell K24 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 3 to 6 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS increases to keep the overall power of Cells 3 to 6 correct.
### 6.4.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.4. References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --14.98dB and --12.03dB, which
comply with the requirements of -15dB and --13dB for Cell 1 at T1 and T2
respectively.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells F22 and G22 give --12.03dB and --14.98dB, which
comply with the requirements of -13dB and --15dB for Cell 2 at T1 and T2
respectively.
b) The worst-case difference during time T1 between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 2 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell D24 gives a difference of -2.01dB for Cell 1
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io, which complies with the requirement of -2dB
during time T1.
c) The worst-case difference during time T2 between Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 2 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E25 gives a difference of 2.01dB for Cell 1
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io, which complies with the requirement of 2dB
during time T2.
d) In order to ensure the geometry factors Îor/Ioc remain centred on the
values stated in the original table, the nominal Io for channel 1 and channel
2 stated in the original table shall not be modified.
For channel 1 at T2 and channel 2 at T1, sheet _Error analysis_ cells E28 and
F29 give a nominal Io of --64.75dBm, which is the same as the stated value of
--64.75dBm.
For channel 1 at T1 and channel 2 at T2, sheet _Error analysis_ cells D28 and
G29 give a nominal Io of --66.82dBm, which is within 0.03dB of the stated
value of --66.85dBm.
e) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3 through 6 shall not be higher than
the value stated in the original table. This will prevent the interfering
cells from having a larger impact on the test than originally intended.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells H21 to O21 all have values in the range
\--20.01dB to --20.27dB, which comply with the requirement of -20dB for Cells
3 to 6.
f) Provided guideline c) is met first, the worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cells 3
through 6 shall not fall below the CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range of --24 dB.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells H22 to O22 all have values in the range
\--21.16dB to --21.42dB, which comply with the requirements of -24dB for Cells
3 to 6.
g) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G14 show that the channel power ratios of
all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are increased by
the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is subject to the
same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to comply under
guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall below the stated
Ec/Io ratio.
h) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
The channel power ratios of all the active channels in Cells 3 to 6 has been
decreased by 0.7dB to meet guideline e). The nominal Ioc for Channel 1 at T2
and Channel 2 at T1 has been changed from --70.0dBm to \--71.6dBm. These
changes will not have any material effect on the test.
## 6.4A Test 8.3.5.4 Cell reselection in CELL_FACH during an MBMS session, two
frequencies
### 6.4A.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.3.5.4.4.6.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up for a two-frequency test are:
\- Cell 1 does not exist during T1, and only appears during T2 and T3.
\- For channel 1, the overall power within the radio channel changes among T1,
T2 and T3, so the pies are different sizes.
\- Channel 2 is unchanged between T1 and T2.
\- For channel 2, the overall power within the radio channel changes between
T1/T2 and T3, so the pies are different sizes.
\- The noise is a significant fraction of the overall power.
### 6.4A.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The worst-case difference during time T2 between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 2 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
c) The worst-case difference during time T3 between Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3.2 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
d) In order to ensure the geometry factors Îor/Ioc remain centred on the
values stated in the original table, the nominal Io for channel 1 and channel
2 stated in the original table shall not be modified.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 6.4A.3 Uncertainty parameter set
As there is only one cell for each channel, each cell has its power specified
as an absolute accuracy. The relative power of one cell compared to the other
is not important for this test.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
**Channel 1 during T1:**
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (1): +/-1.0dB
**Channel 1 during T2 and T3:**
CPICH_Ec/Ior (1) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (1): +/-1.0dB
**Channel 2 during T1, T2 and T3:**
CPICH_Ec/Ior (1) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (1): +/-1.0dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 6.4A.4 Assumptions
Same as defined for test 8.3.2.2 in clause 6.3.4.
### 6.4A.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.4A.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 6.4A.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 6.4A.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet. It is necessary to first calculate the sensitivities before entering
the equations in the _Apply uncertainties \-- Find Ior_ sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for cell 1 at T2 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell Q22 of the _Error summation_
sheet, and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((\$F\$21*\$G\$21)/(\$Q\$21+\$F\$21))
> \- The terms in the denominator are the linear powers for the cell and the
> noise on Channel 1, added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$F\$21_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T2,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$G\$21_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10* log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case \--15.00000dB
> with nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell Q23 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio
=10*LOG((\$F\$21*\$G\$21)/(\$Q\$21*(10\^(0.01/10))+\$F\$21))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --15.00684dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.684, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell Q11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to give the correct value for the sensitivity. The
sensitivity of --0.684 is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 18 contributing uncertainties for the two-frequency test is
treated the same way by rewriting the equations. The resulting sensitivities
are then applied to the relevant cells. The same process is repeated for each
UE parameter listed in column A, keeping channel 1 and channel 2 separate.
Because the conditions at T1, T2 and T3 are different, the process is carried
out thrice: once for T1, once for T2 and once for T3.
In cases where the value can be deduced as 1.000 or 0 by inspection the
sensitivity is entered directly.
EXAMPLE: Cell on channel 2 do not affect channel 1, so the sensitivity is
entered as 0.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell Q6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, Cell Q11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell Q12.
#### 6.4A.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 6.4A.5.1 to predict the overall effect
on the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute levels of the cell on each channel, the
uncertainty in the noise on each channel, and the uncertainty in channel power
ratio, are entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_
sheet. Separate sets of columns are used for T1, for T2 and for T3.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14 and 17 on the
_Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to
each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause
6.4A.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test
system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. The _Combi_ sum of errors in
column Z, AD and AH has been selected as the most realistic model, but is the
same as root-sum-squares combination for these tests because no adverse
effects of correlation are envisaged. This is consistent with the assumptions
given in clause 6.4A.4.
#### 6.4A.5.3 Derivation of equations for Ior(n)
The _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet is used. Several strategies are
possible to ensure that the Cell 1/Cell 2 CPICH ratio at least meets the
original value as stated in clauses 6.4A.2 b) and 6.4A.2 c), and also to keep
the nominal Io(1) and Io(2) values as stated in clause 6.4.2 d). The strategy
taken here is to make no changes to the Cell 1 at T2 and Cell 2 at T3, but to
increase Ior(2) at T2 and Ior(1) at T3 at the expense of Ioc. The benefits of
this approach are:
a) Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2 and Cell1 CPICH_Ec/Io at T3 get bigger, to
decrease the Cell 1/Cell 2 CPICH ratio at T2 and the Cell 2/Cell 1 CPICH ratio
at T3.
b) Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2 and Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T3 do not get any
smaller, so it does not need a large CPICH offset in clause 6.4A.5.6 to
maintain the minimum CPICH_Ec/Io value.
c) The setting of Ior(n) and the CPICH offsets become independent, non-
iterative, steps.
A \"Channel 2 Cell and noise calculator\" and \"Channel 1 Cell and noise
calculator\" are provided on the _Apply uncertainties -- Find Ior_ sheet, in
rows 38 to 48 and columns H to O. The calculator is used to decide how much
linear power to transfer from Ioc (the noise) to Cell 2 at T2 and Cell 1 at
T3. These calculations are done by increasing the CPICH_Ec/Io by similar
amount of CPICH_Ec/Io error on the _Error summation_ sheet.
The \"Goal seek\" spreadsheet tool is used to choose values of cell L40 and
L46 which meet the targets of 1.04 dB in cell N42 and 1.12 dB in cell N48. The
target values are obtained from cell AD18 and cell AH18 on the _Error
summation_ sheet.
The Ior(n) and Ioc(m) powers in cells D50 to O50 are then carried forward to
the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 6.4A.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell M27 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 6.4A.5.6.
#### 6.4A.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The \"Combi\" sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to
give high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell M27 set to zero, the set value of Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2
is --15.00dB as shown in cell E21, but it may be as high as \--14.16dB (cell
E22) or as low as --15.84dB (cell E23). The high and low values are obtained
by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 6.4A.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the
test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would
fall outside the limit specified in clause 6.4A.2 a). An offset to the
CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been added in the
_Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +1.0 dB in cell M27 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell M26 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cell 1 and Cell 2
correct.
### 6.4A.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.4A.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The Worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of cell 1 and cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells E23 and F23 give --14.84dB and --11.50dB, which
comply with the requirements of -15dB and --13dB for Cell 1 at T2 and T3
respectively.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells G23, H23 and I23 give --12.62dB, --11.58dB and
--16.13dB, which comply with the requirements of --13dB, --13dB and \--16.2dB
for Cell 2 at T1, T2 and T3 respectively.
b) The worst-case difference during time T2 between Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 2 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell E25 gives a difference of -2.00dB for Cell 1
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io, which complies with the requirement of -2dB
during time T2.
c) The worst-case difference during time T3 between Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io and
Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io shall not be less than 3.2 dB, the value implied in the
original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F26 gives a difference of 3.20dB for Cell 1
CPICH_Ec/Io / Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io, which complies with the requirement of 3.2dB
during time T3.
d) In order to ensure the geometry factors Îor/Ioc remain centred on the
values stated in the original table, the nominal Io for channel 1 and channel
2 stated in the original table shall not be modified.
For each channel at T1, T2 and T3, sheet _Error analysis_ cells D29, E29, F29,
G30, H30, and I30 give a nominal Io of --70.00dBm, --68.35dBm, \--66.98dBm,
--66.98dBm, --66.98dBm and --68.81dBm, which are the same as the stated values
in the original table.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for cell 1
and cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to I15 show that the channel power ratios of
all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are increased by
the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is subject to the
same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to comply under
guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall below the stated
Ec/Io ratio.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
The nominal Ioc for Channel 1 at T3 and Channel 2 at T2 has been changed from
--70.0dBm to --71.52dBm and from --70.0dBm to --71.38dBm respectively. These
changes will not have any material effect on the test.

### 6.8.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3]
tables 8.6.2.1.1 and 8.6.2.1.3.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up for this two-frequency test are:
\- Cell 1 and Cell 2 are on channel 1
\- Cell 3 is on channel 2.
\- Channel 1is unchanged between T0 and T1.
\- For channel 1, the overall power within the radio channel changes between
T0/T1 and T2, so the pies are different sizes.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T0 or T1, and only appears during T2.
\- Channel 2 is unchanged between T1 and T2
\- Cell 3 does not exist during T0, and only appears during T1 and T2.
\- The noise on both channel 1 and channel 2 remains the same absolute power
during T0, T1 and T2, but becomes a smaller fraction of the overall power.
### 6.8.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured by the UE during time T1 shall
not be less than -18 dB, the value of the Ec/Io threshold for a non-used
frequency. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency absolute accuracy. This will ensure that Event 2C (The estimated
quality of a non-used frequency is above a certain threshold) occurs.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -4 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs.
d) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 6.8.3 Uncertainty parameter set
A parameter set is defined for each channel present. Since the UE is set to
use CPICH_Ec/No as a quality measure, and CPICH_Ec/No is measured within the
channel bandwidth, the quantity to be controlled is CPICH_Ec/Io. The overall
Io level of channel 1 relative to channel 2 is not important.
The parameter set also puts a constraint on the level of Cell 2 relative to
Cell 1 within channel 1, because the UE makes a relative measurement of the
CPICH Ec/Io values.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
The two channels each have their own separate absolute power reference.
##### Channel 1 during T0, T1 and T2: {#channel-1-during-t0-t1-and-t2 .H6}
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (1): +/-1.0dB
CPICH_Ec/Ior (1) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
##### Channel 1 during T2: {#channel-1-during-t2-1 .H6}
Level uncertainty of Ior (2) relative to Ior (1): +/- 0.3dB
CPICH_Ec/Ior (2) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
##### Channel 2 during T0, T1 and T2: {#channel-2-during-t0-t1-and-t2 .H6}
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (2): +/-1.0dB
##### Channel 2 during T1 and T2: {#channel-2-during-t1-and-t2-1 .H6}
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (3): +/-0.7dB
CPICH_Ec/Ior (3) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 6.8.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(n) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
e) The absolute uncertainty of Ior(1) and the relative uncertainty of Ior(2),
are uncorrelated to each other.
f) The absolute uncertainties for Ior(1) and Ior(3) may have any amount of
positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
g) The absolute uncertainties for Ioc(1) and Ioc(2) may have any amount of
positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).:
### 6.8.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.5.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 6.8.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 6.8.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for Cell 1 at T1 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell W32 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((\$F\$31*\$G\$31)/(\$F\$31+\$L\$31+W\$31))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers for the cells on
> Channel 1, 2 cells + noise, added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$F\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T1,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _*\$G\$31_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10* log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case \--13.00000dB
> with nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell W33 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =
10*LOG((\$F\$31*\$G\$31)/(\$F\$31+\$L\$31+W\$31*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --13.00499dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.499, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell W11 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to give the correct value for the sensitivity. The
sensitivity of --0.499 is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 8 contributing uncertainties is treated the same way by rewriting
the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then applied to the relevant
cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed in column A.
Because the conditions at T0, T1 and T2 are different, the process is carried
out three times for T0, T1 and T2.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when a
cell is not present in that time period.
In cases where the value can be deduced as 1.000 or 0 by inspection the
sensitivity is entered directly.
EXAMPLE: Cells on channel 2 do not affect channel 1, so the sensitivity is
entered as 0.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell W6, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, Cell W11 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell W12.
#### 6.8.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 6.8.5.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 3 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise on each channel, and the uncertainty in channel power
ratio, are entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 6 of the _Error summation_
sheet. Separate sets of columns are used for T0, T1 and T2.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 11, 14, 17 and 20 on the
_Error summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to
each of the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause
6.8.5.1, and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test
system uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the
individual effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. Root sum squares (RSS)
summation of errors has been used in columns AC to AE because no adverse
effects of correlation are envisaged, and is consistent with the assumptions
given in clause 6.8.4.
#### 6.8.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Original_ sheet is used to
calculate the nominal powers for each cell. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet is not used.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to L35 of the _Original_ sheet, and are
carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 6.8.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1, 2 and 3 are not given an
offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell M24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 6.8.5.6.
#### 6.8.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The RSS sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to give
high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell M24 set to zero, the set value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io at T1
is --14.00dB as shown in cell K20, but it may be as high as \--13.26dB (cell
K21) or as low as --14.74dB (cell K22). The high and low values are obtained
by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 6.8.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1,Cell 2 and Cell 3 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1, 2 and 3 were not given an
offset. Comparing the CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the
test requirement guidelines shows that with no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would
fall outside the limit specified in clause 6.8.2 a). An offset to the
CPICH_Ec/Io power ratio in Cells 1, 2 and 3 has therefore been added in the
_Error analysis_ sheet.
A value of +0.8 dB in cell M24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell M25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1, 2 and 3 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cells 1, 2 and 3
correct.
### 6.8.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.5. References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall
below the values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from
entering a less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22, E22 and F22 give --12.83dB, --12.83dB and
--12.43dB at T0, T1 and T2 respectively, which comply with the requirement of
-13dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell I22 gives --13.98dB at T3, which complies with the
requirement of --14.5dB for Cell 2.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells K22 and L22 give --13.94dB and --13.94dB at T1
and T2 respectively, which comply with the requirement of --14dB for Cell 3.
b) The value of Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured by the UE during time T1 shall
not be less than -18 dB, the value of the Ec/Io threshold for a non-used
frequency. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency absolute accuracy. This will ensure that Event 2C (The estimated
quality of a non-used frequency is above a certain threshold) occurs.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell K22 gives --13.94dB at T1. Even if the UE reports
this a further 1.5dB low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency
absolute measurement accuracy with Cell 3 CPICH_Ec/Io >-14dB) the lowest
reported value would be --15.44dB, which complies with the requirement of
-18dB during time T1.
c) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io relative to Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured
by the UE during time T2 shall not be less than -4 dB, the value of the
reporting range. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io
Intra frequency relative measurement accuracy. This will ensure that Event 1A
(A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range) occurs.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell F25 gives --1.83dB at T2. Even if the UE reports
this a further 2dB low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Intra frequency relative
measurement accuracy with Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io >-16dB) the lowest
reported value would be --3.83dB, which complies with the requirement of -4dB
during time T2.
d) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
For channel 1 at T0, T1 and T2, sheet _Error analysis_ cells D27, E27 and F27
give nominal Io values of --66.99dBm, -66.99dBm and --61.60dBm respectively,
which are within 0.02dB of the stated values of \--66.98dBm, -66.98dBm and
--61.58dBm.
For channel 2 at T0, T1 and T2, sheet _Error analysis_ cells D28, E28 and F28
give nominal Io values of --70.00dBm, -67.80dBm and --67.80dBm respectively,
which are the same as the stated values of --70.00dBm, -67.80dBm and
--67.80dBm.
e) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1,
Cell 2 and Cell 3 shall not fall below the values implied in the original
table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to L13 and D14 to F14 show that the channel
power ratios of all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are
increased by the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is
subject to the same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to
comply under guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall
below the stated Ec/Io ratio.
f) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.

### 6.11.1 Minimum requirements
The normative reference for this requirement is 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] table
8.6.2.2.4.2.
The cell-specific parameters in 3GPP TS 34.121 [1, 2, 3] are expressed as
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}/I_{\text{oc}}$ratios in dB, and$I_{\text{oc}}$ is
expressed in dBm/3.84 MHz. To analyse the relationship between the parameters
which can be set by the test system and the signal presented to the UE, it is
useful to show the composite signal in the form of a pie chart. The size of
the pie is scaled according to the overall power Io on a channel, and the
angle of the sector shows the percentage of power contributed by a cell.
NOTE: The pie charts do not attempt to show any of the code channel power
ratios within each cell, only the cell powers and noise power.
The main points to note about the cell set-up for this two-frequency test are:
\- Cell 1 is on channel 1.
\- Cell 2 is on channel 2.
\- Channel 1is unchanged between T1 and T2.
\- Channel 2 is changed between T1 and T2.
\- Cell 2 does not exist during T1, and only appears during T2.
\- The noise on both channel 1 and channel 2 remains the same absolute power
during T1 and T2, but becomes a smaller fraction of the overall power.
### 6.11.2 Test requirement guidelines
The following guidelines are a prioritised list of which test parameters have
the most effect on the results of the test. When the uncertainties of the test
system are considered, the priorities given in the guidelines below are used
in order to ensure that the most important parameters are optimised first.
This will ensure that the test is carried out in conditions as close as
possible to those for which the test purpose was originally defined.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1 and Cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured by the UE during time T2 shall
not be less than -18 dB, the value of the Ec/Io threshold for a non-used
frequency. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Intra
frequency absolute accuracy. This will ensure that Event 2C (The estimated
quality of a non-used frequency is above a certain threshold) occurs.
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1
and Cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
### 6.11.3 Uncertainty parameter set
A parameter set is defined for each channel present. Since the UE is set to
use CPICH_Ec/No as a quality measure, and CPICH_Ec/No is measured within the
channel bandwidth, the quantity to be controlled is CPICH_Ec/Io. The overall
Io level of channel 1 relative to channel 2 is not important.
Within each channel, the noise is specified as an absolute accuracy. This is
because it has a different bandwidth from the cell powers, and may be measured
using different equipment.
The two channels each have their own separate absolute power reference.
Channel 1 during T1 and T2:
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (1): +/-0.7dB
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (1): +/-1.0dB
CPICH_Ec/Ior (1) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
Channel 2 during T1 and T2:
Absolute level uncertainty of Ioc (2): +/-1.0dB
Channel 2 during T2:
Absolute level uncertainty of Ior (2): +/-0.7dB
CPICH_Ec/Ior (2) uncertainty: +/-0.1dB
The chosen parameters form a minimum set, allowing the principle of
superposition to be applied. The values are chosen to be the same as
uncertainties used elsewhere in other conformance tests.
### 6.11.4 Assumptions
a) The contributing uncertainties for Ior(n), channel power ratio, and Ioc are
derived according to ETR 273-1-2 [4], with a coverage factor of k=2.
b) Within each cell, the uncertainty for Ior(n), and channel power ratio are
uncorrelated to each other.
c) Across different cells, the channel power ratio uncertainties may have any
amount of positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully
correlated).
d) The uncertainty for Ioc and Ior(n) may have any amount of positive
correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
e) The absolute uncertainties for Ior(1) and Ior(2) may have any amount of
positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).
f) The absolute uncertainties for Ioc(1) and Ioc(2) may have any amount of
positive correlation from zero (uncorrelated) to one (fully correlated).:
### 6.11.5 Calculation of test requirements
The calculations are performed using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.8.
References to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
#### 6.11.5.1 Sensitivity analysis
The pie charts in clause 6.9.1 represent the signal presented to the UE, and
can be used to understand the basis for the equations in the _Error summation_
sheet.
EXAMPLE: The CPICH_Ec/Io ratio for Cell 1 at T1 is calculated using the
following equation, which is copied from cell L22 of the _Error summation_
sheet and is given in the same format:
Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =10*LOG((\$D\$21*\$E\$21)/(\$D\$21+ L\$21))
> \- The terms in the denominator are all the linear powers for the cells on
> Channel 1, 2 cells + noise, added up as fractions.
>
> \- The _\$D\$21_ term in the numerator is the linear power of Cell 1 at T1,
> as a fraction.
>
> \- The _\$E\$21_ term in the numerator is the linear fraction of power in
> Cell 1 CPICH code channel.
>
> \- The _10* log_ term gives the result in dB, in this case \--13.00000dB
> with nominal values.
To calculate the sensitivity for a specific parameter, an arbitrary change of
0.01dB is applied to it. In the example below the absolute power of the noise
is varied. A linear scaling factor for 0.01 dB expressed as *(10\^(0.01/10))
is pasted into the equation, copied from cell L23 of the _Error summation_
sheet:
New Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io ratio =
10*LOG((\$D\$21*\$E\$21)/(\$D\$21+L\$21*(10\^(0.01/10))))
This gives a new value for the CPICH_Ec/Io ratio of --13.00499dB with the
scaled-up noise. The difference from the original is taken and then multiplied
by 100 to get -0.499, which is the change of the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io per dB
change in the noise power. In this example cell L10 of the _Error summation_
sheet is made equal to this value.
A small change is chosen to give the correct value for the sensitivity. The
sensitivity of --0.499 is clearly different from +1, and illustrates why the
method is necessary. The sign of the sensitivity is negative, which shows that
a rise in the noise power results in a reduction in the Cell 1 CPICH_Ec/Io
ratio.
Each of the 6 contributing uncertainties is treated the same way by rewriting
the equations. The resulting sensitivities are then applied to the relevant
cells. The same process is repeated for each UE parameter listed in column A.
Because the conditions at T1 and T2 are different, the process is carried out
two times, for T1 and T2.
Cells are coloured grey when a parameter is not relevant, for example when a
cell is not present in that time period.
In cases where the value can be deduced as 1.000 or 0 by inspection the
sensitivity is entered directly.
EXAMPLE: The cell on channel 2 do not affect channel 1, so the sensitivity is
entered as 0.
The contributing uncertainty, for example Cell L5, is multiplied by the
sensitivity value, Cell L10 in this example, to give the resultant uncertainty
in cell L11.
#### 6.11.5.2 Superposition of uncertainty effects
The _Error summation_ sheet takes each test system uncertainty and uses the
sensitivity factors derived in clause 6.9.5.1 to predict the overall effect on
the critical parameters at the UE.
The uncertainties in the absolute and relative levels of the 2 cells, the
uncertainty in the noise on each channel, and the uncertainty in channel power
ratio are entered in the pink cells in row 3 to 5 of the _Error summation_
sheet. Separate sets of columns are used for T1 and T2.
The critical parameters at the UE are listed in rows 10 and 13 on the _Error
summation_ sheet. Each parameter has a figure for its sensitivity to each of
the setting uncertainties. The sensitivities were obtained in clause 6.9.5.1,
and are valid for parameters near the nominal figures. Each test system
uncertainty is multiplied by the relevant sensitivity, to give the individual
effect on each critical parameter at the UE.
The figures in the sum columns of the _Error summation_ sheet are the overall
spread that can be expected for those parameters. Root sum squares (RSS)
summation of errors has been used in columns Q and R because no adverse
effects of correlation are envisaged, and is consistent with the assumptions
given in clause 6.9.4.
#### 6.11.5.3 Derivation of Ior(n)
Several strategies are possible to ensure that the test requirement guidelines
are met. The strategy taken here is to make no changes to the Cell powers, but
to meet the test requirements by changing only the channel power ratios. The
benefit of this approach is simplicity. The _Original_ sheet is used to
calculate the nominal powers for each cell. The _Apply uncertainties -- Find
Ior_ sheet is not used.
The Ior(n) values appear in cells D35 to G35 of the _Original_ sheet, and are
carried forward to the _Error analysis_ sheet.
#### 6.11.5.4 Determination of initial Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 are not given an offset.
A value of 0 dB is entered in cell H24 on the _Error analysis_ sheet, but is
modified later in clause 6.9.5.6.
#### 6.11.5.5 Prediction of spread in critical parameters
The RSS sum of errors is then used back in the _Error analysis_ sheet to give
high and low figures.
EXAMPLE: With cell H24 set to zero, the set value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io at T2
is --14.00dB as shown in cell G20, but it may be as high as \--13.26dB (cell
G21) or as low as --14.74dB (cell G22). The high and low values are obtained
by simply adding or subtracting the summed uncertainties to the set value.
Other critical parameters are treated in the same way as the example.
The blue cells show the values that have to be checked against the test
requirement guidelines.
#### 6.11.5.6 Determination of final Cell 1 and Cell 2 CPICH offsets
Initially the channel power ratios in Cells 1 and 2 were not given an offset.
Comparing the CPICH_Ec/Io (high) and CPICH_Ec/Io (low) values with the test
requirement guidelines shows that with no offset, CPICH_Ec/Io (low) would fall
outside the limit specified in clause 6.9.2 a). An offset to the CPICH_Ec/Io
power ratio in Cells 1 and 2 has therefore been added in the _Error analysis_
sheet.
A value of +0.8 dB in cell H24 ensures that the requirements are met.
A similar offset in cell H25 is applied to the other specified channels on
Cells 1 and 2 to maintain the same relative power between code channels.
The power in OCNS decreases to keep the overall power of Cells 1 and 2
correct.
### 6.11.6 Check against test requirement guidelines
The numbers given are derived using the spreadsheet in Annex A.2.8. References
to individual sheets within the spreadsheet are given in _italics_.
a) The worst-case CPICH_Ec/Io of Cell 1 and Cell 2 shall not fall below the
values stated in the original table. This will prevent the UE from entering a
less accurate CPICH_Ec/Io reporting range.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D22 and E22 give --12.83dB and --12.83dB at T1
and T2 respectively, which comply with the requirement of -13dB for Cell 1.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cell G22 give --13.94dB at T2, which comply with the
requirement of --14dB for Cell 2.
b) The value of Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io as measured by the UE during time T2 shall
not be less than -18 dB, the value of the Ec/Io threshold for a non-used
frequency. The requirement shall include the effect of UE CPICH_Ec/Io Inter
frequency absolute accuracy. This will ensure that Event 2C (The estimated
quality of a non-used frequency is above a certain threshold) occurs.
_Sheet Error analysis cell G22 gives --13.94dB at T2._ Even if the UE reports
this a further 1.5dB low (as allowed by its CPICH_Ec/Io Inter frequency
absolute measurement accuracy with Cell 2 CPICH_Ec/Io >-14dB) the lowest
reported value would be --15.44dB, which complies with the requirement of
-18dB during time T2 _._
c) The nominal Io stated in the original table shall not be modified. This
will ensure that the basic condition of the test is unchanged.
For channel 1 at T1 and T2, sheet _Error analysis_ cells D27 and E27 give
nominal Io values of --66.99dBm and -66.99dBm respectively, which are within
0.02dB of the stated values of --66.98dBm and -66.98dBm.
For channel 2 at T1 and T2, sheet _Error analysis_ cells D28 and E28 give
nominal Io values of --70.00dBm and -67.80dBm, which are the same as the
stated values of --70.00dBm and --67.80dBm.
d) The worst-case Ec/Io ratios of all other channels (except OCNS) for Cell 1
and Cell 2 shall not fall below the values implied in the original table.
Sheet _Error analysis_ cells D11 to G13 and D14 to E14 show that the channel
power ratios of all the other channels for Cell 1 and Cell 2 (except OCNS) are
increased by the same amount as the CPICH. As their variability at the UE is
subject to the same influences as the CPICH, which has already been shown to
comply under guideline a), the other channels (except OCNS) will not fall
below the stated Ec/Io ratio.
e) All other parameters stated in the original table shall not be changed more
than necessary to meet the requirements.
No other parameters have been changed.
