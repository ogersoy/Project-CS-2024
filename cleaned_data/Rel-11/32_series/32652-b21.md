definition
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources, and they
may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations Systems
(OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the GERAN network resource information that can
be communicated between an IRPAgent and one or several IRPManagers for network
management purposes.
This document specifies the semantics and behaviour of information object
class attributes and relations visible across the reference point in a
protocol and technology neutral way. It does not define their syntax and
encoding.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply. For terms and definitions not found here, please refer to 3GPP TS
32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.600 [14].
**Association** : In general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
(1) name bindings,
(2) reference attributes, and
(3) association objects.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams).
**Managed Element (ME)** : An instance of the IOC ManagedElement, defined in
3GPP TS 32.622 [16].
**Managed Object (MO)** : In the context of the present document, a Managed
Object (MO) is a software object that encapsulates the manageable
characteristics and behaviour of a particular Network Resource. The MO is
instance of a class defined in a MIM/NRM. This class, called **Information
Object Class (IOC)** has [attributes]{.underline} that provide information
used to characterize the objects that belong to the class (the term
\"attribute\" is taken from TMN and corresponds to a \"property\" according to
CIM). Furthermore, the IOC can have [operations]{.underline} that represent
the behaviour relevant for that class (the term \"operation\" is taken from
TMN and corresponds to a \"method\" according to CIM). The IOC may support the
emission of [notifications]{.underline} that provide information about an
event occurrence within a network resource.
**Management Information Base (MIB)** : A MIB is an instance of an NRM and has
some values on the defined attributes and associations specific for that
instance. In the context of the present document, an MIB consists of:
(1) a Name space (describing the MO containment hierarchy in the MIB through
Distinguished Names),
(2) a number of IOCs with their attributes and
(3) a number of Associations between these IOCs. Also note that TMN (ITU-T
Recommendation X.710 [7]) defines a concept of a [Management Information
Tree]{.underline} (also known as a Naming Tree) that corresponds to the name
space (containment hierarchy) portion of this MIB definition. Figure 3.1
depicts the relationships between a Name space and a number of participating
MOs (the shown association is of a non-containment type).
Figure 3.1: Relationships between a Name space and a number of participating
MOs
**Management Information Model (MIM)** : Also referred to as NRM -- see the
definition below.
**Name space** : A name space is a collection of names. The IRP name
convention (see 3GPP TS 32.300 [13]) restricts the name space to a
hierarchical containment structure, including its simplest form - the one-
level, flat name space.\ All Managed Objects in a MIB shall be included in the
corresponding name space and the MIB/name space shall only support a strict
hierarchical containment structure (with one root object). A Managed Object
that contains another is said to be the superior (parent); the contained
Managed Object is referred to as the subordinate (child). The parent of all
MOs in a single name space is called a Local Root. The ultimate parent of all
MOs of all managed systems is called the Global Root.
**Network Resource Model (NRM)** : A model representing the actual managed
telecommunications network resources that a System is providing through the
subject IRP. An NRM identifies and describes the IOCs, their associations,
attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as \"MIM\" (see above),
which originates from the ITU-T TMN.

# 4 System overview
## 4.1 Void
## 4.2 Compliance rules
The following defines the meaning of Mandatory and Optional IOC attributes and
associations between IOCs, in Solution Sets to the IRP defined by the present
document:
  * The IRPManager shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. The IRPManager shall be prepared to receive information related to mandatory as well as optional attributes/associations without failure; however the IRPManager does not have to support handling of the optional attributes/associations.
  * The IRPAgent shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. It may support optional attributes/associations.
An IRPAgent that incorporates vendor-specific extensions shall support normal
communication with a 3GPP SA5‑compliant IRPManager with respect to all
Mandatory and Optional information object classes, attributes, associations,
operations, parameters and notifications without requiring the IRPManager to
have any knowledge of the extensions.
Given that
  * rules for vendor-specific extensions remain to be fully specified, > and
  * many scenarios under which IRPManager and IRPAgent interwork may > exist,
it is recognised that the IRPManager, even though it is not required to have
knowledge of vendor-specific extensions, may be required to be implemented
with an awareness that extensions can exist and behave accordingly.
# 5 Modelling approach
The modelling approach adopted and used in this IRP is described in clause 5
of Generic Network Resources IRP: NRM 3GPP TS 32.622 [16].

NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers represent transient as well as steady-
state numbers, and reflect all managed object creation and deletion scenarios.
NOTE 2: Void.
NOTE 3: The ExternalBssFunction is used in the Core Network NRM.
Figure 6.1: GERAN NRM Containment/Naming and Association diagram
Each Managed Object is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to
3GPP TS 32.300 [13] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example,
the DN of an IOC representing a cell could have a format like:
SubNetwork =Sweden,MeContext =MEC-Gbg-1, ManagedElement =RNC-Gbg-1,
BssFunction=BSS1.
{width="2.6770833333333335in" height="3.127083333333333in"}
NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers represent transient as well as steady-
state numbers, and reflect all managed object creation and deletion scenarios.
NOTE 2: Each instance of the VsDataContainer shall only be contained under one
IOC. The VsDataContainer can be contained under IOCs defined in other NRMs.
Figure 6.2: GERAN NRM Containment/Naming and Association diagram
The VsDataContainer is only used for the Bulk CM IRP.
### 6.2.2 Inheritance
This clause depicts the inheritance relationships that exist between IOCs.

### 6.3.4 GsmRelation
#### 6.3.4.1 Definition
This IOC contains a Neighbour cell Relation (NR) from a source cell to a
target cell, where the target cell is a GsmCell or ExternalGsmCell instance.
NOTE: In handover relation terms, the cell containing the GsmRelation object
is the source cell for the handover. The cell referred to in the GsmRelation
object is the target cell for the handover. This defines a one-way handover
relation where the direction is _from_ source cell _to_ target cell.
The source cell can be a GsmCell instance. This is the case for an Intra-GERAN
NR.
The source cell can be an UtranGenericCell instance. This is the case for
Inter-RAT NR from UTRAN to GERAN. See 3GPP TS 32.642 [19].
The source cell can be an EUtranGenericCell instance. This is the case for
Inter-RAT NR from E-UTRAN to GERAN. See 3GPP TS 32.762 [22].
