# 1 Scope
The present document is part of a series of documents that specify charging
functionality and charging management in GSM/UMTS networks. The GSM/UMTS core
network charging architecture and principles are specified in document TS
32.240 [1], which provides an umbrella for other charging management documents
that specify:
\- the content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging),
\- the content of real-time charging events per domain / subsystem (online
charging);
\- the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains and
subsystems;
\- the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the
charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events)
The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240 [1].
The present document specifies the Offline and Online Charging description for
the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), based on the functional descriptions of the
IMS in 3GPP TS 23.228 [200]. This charging description includes the offline
and online charging architecture and scenarios specific to IMS, as well as the
mapping of common 3GPP charging architecture specified in TS 32.240 [1] onto
IMS. It further specifies the structure and content of the CDRs for offline
charging, and the charging events for online charging. The present document is
related to other 3GPP charging TSs as follows:
\- The common 3GPP charging architecture is specified in TS 32.240 [1];
\- The parameters, abstract syntax and encoding rules for these CDR types are
specified in TS 32.298 [51].
\- A transaction based mechanism for the transfer of CDRs within the network
is specified in TS 32.295 [54].
\- The file based mechanism used to transfer the CDRs from the network to the
operator's billing domain (e.g. the billing system or a mediation device) is
specified in TS 32.297 [52].
\- The 3GPP Diameter application that is used for IMS offline and online
charging is specified in TS 32.299 [50].
All terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the present document, that
are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in the 3GPP Vocabulary, TR 21.905
[100]. Those that are common across charging management in GSM/UMTS domains,
services or subsystems are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240 [1] and
are copied into clause 3 of the present document for ease of reading. Finally,
those items that are specific to the present document are defined exclusively
in the present document.
Furthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in 3GPP
TS 22.115 [101].

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [50], 3GPP TS 32.240 [1], and the following apply:
**billing:** function whereby CDRs generated by the charging function are
transformed into bills requiring payment.
**Billing Domain:** Part of the operator network, which is outside the core
network that receives and processes charging information from the core network
charging functions. It includes functions that can provide billing mediation
and billing end applications.
**CDR field Categories:** the CDR fields are defined in the present document.
They are divided into the following categories:
**\- Mandatory:** field that shall be present in the CDR.
**\- Conditional:** field that shall be present in a CDR if certain conditions
are met.
**\- Operator Provisionable: Mandatory:** A field that operators have
provisioned to be included in the CDR for all conditions.
**\- Operator Provisionable: Conditional:** A field that operators have
provisioned to be included in the CDR if certain conditions are met.
**charged party:** user involved in a chargeable event that has to pay parts
or the whole charges of the chargeable event, or a third party paying the
charges caused by one or all users involved in the chargeable event, or a
network operator.
**charging:** function whereby information related to a chargeable event is
formatted and transferred in order to make it possible to determine usage for
which the charged party may be billed.
**Charging Data Record (CDR):** record generated by a network element for the
purpose of billing a subscriber for the provided service. It includes fields
identifying the user, the session and the network elements as well as
information on the network resources and services used to support a subscriber
session. In the traditional circuit domain, CDR has been used to denote \"Call
Detail Record\", which is subsumed by \"Charging Data Record\" hereafter.
**charging function:** entity inside the core network domain, subsystem or
service that is involved in charging for that domain, subsystem or service.
**offline charging:** charging mechanism where charging information **does
not** affect, in real-time, the service rendered
**online charging:** charging mechanism where charging information can affect,
in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of the
charging mechanism with session/service control is required
**partial CDR:** CDR that provides information on part of a subscriber
session. A long session may be covered by several partial CDRs. Two formats
are considered for Partial CDRs. One that contains all of the necessary
fields; the second has a reduced format.

# 5 Charging Principles
## 5.1 IMS Charging Principles
The IMS network elements shall maintain the integrity of all received or
created charging-related information when forwarding the information to the
offline and online charging systems, whatever the length of the value of any
particular parameter is. For example, the IMS Charging Identifier (ICID) may
be generated by one IMS network element (e.g. the P-CSCF) and forwarded to
another IMS network element (e.g. the S-CSCF). Both may generate charging
information and ensure that the data integrity is maintained, in order to make
possible correlation based on the ICID.
### 5.1.1 IMS Charging applicability
The AS and MRFC are able to distinguish whether to apply offline or online
charging, i.e. whether to send charging information over the Rf interface to
the CDF or over the Ro interface to the OCS, which includes ECF and SCF as
described in chapter 4.3 (or to use both). The decision of which interface to
use is based on the information (CDF and/or OCS address) the AS/MRFC receives
in the SIP signalling and the system configuration as provisioned by the
operator. If the AS/MRFC only receive the CDF address and do not receive an
OCS address then they use only the Rf interface. If only the OCS address was
provided then they use only the Ro interface. In cases where both CDF and OCS
addresses are provided it is possible to use both interfaces simultaneously.
However, operators may overrule the addresses received via the SIP signalling
and use their own configured rules instead. Operators may configure locally on
the AS/MRFC an OCS and/or CDF address. The choice of whether the IMS network
elements use locally configured addresses or the addresses received by SIP
signalling, and the decision on which interface(s) to use, is left for
operator configuration.
All other IMS network elements (S-CSCF, P-CSCF, I-CSCF, BGCF, IBCF, and MGCF)
apply offline charging via the Rf interface using the CDF address as received
via SIP signalling or the locally configured CDF address in the IMS network
element. The S-CSCF supports online charging using:
\- the ISC interface, i.e. if the application server addressed over ISC is the
IMS Gateway Function, or
\- the Ro interface directly instead of the ISC, if the IMS Gateway Function
is integrated within the S-CSCF.
The offline and online charging function addresses transferred in SIP
signalling are encoded in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses as defined in TS
24.229 [204] and RFC7315 [406]. The P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
contains the following parameters: CCF (i.e. CDF) and ECF (i.e. OCS).
### 5.1.2 IMS Charging Correlation
#### 5.1.2.1 Basic Principles for IMS Domain Correlation
The IMS charging correlation information is encoded in the SIP P-Charging-
Vector header as defined in the following sub clauses. The P-Charging-Vector
header contains the following parameters: ICID, access network charging
identifier and IOI.
General correlation mechanisms are defined in TS 32.240 [1], and further
details about the usage of P-Charging-Vector are defined in TS 24.229 [204],
TS 24.292 [210], and RFC 7315 [406].
The enhanced MSC server for ICS charging in this specification refers the MSC
server which performs IMS registration, as defined in TS 23.292 [219]. The
enhanced MSC server for SRVCC charging in this specification refers the MSC
server defined in TS 24.237 [408].
#### 5.1.2.2 IMS Charging Identifier (ICID)
The IMS domain correlation is based on IMS Charging Identifier (ICID) shared
between IMS network elements involved with the same session/transaction. With
ICID it is possible to correlate session/transaction related charging data
generated in different IMS elements (i.e. x-CSCFs, ASs'). The ICID is included
in all SIP methods, if the P-Charging-Vector header is present, and
transferred through originating and terminating side nodes, except to UE.
The value of the ICID parameter is identical with the \'icid-value\' parameter
defined in TS 24.229 [204]. The \'icid-value\' is a mandatory part of the
P-Charging-Vector and coded as a text-based UTF-8 charset (as are all SIP
messages). For further information regarding the composition and usage of the
P-Charging-Vector refer to [204] and RFC 7315 [406].
The ICID value is globally unique across all 3GPP IMS networks for a time
period of at least one month, implying that neither the node that generated
this ICID nor any other IMS network element reuse this value before the
uniqueness period expires. The one month minimum uniqueness period counts from
the time of release of the ICID, i.e. the ICID value no longer being used.
This can be achieved by using node specific information, e.g. high-granularity
time information and / or topology / location information. The exact method
how to achieve the uniqueness requirement is an implementation issue.
At each SIP session unrelated method, both initial and subsequent (e.g.,
REGISTER, NOTIFY, MESSAGE etc.), a new, session unrelated ICID is generated at
the first IMS network element that processes the method. This ICID value is
contained in the SIP request and response of that SIP transaction and must be
valid for the duration of the transaction.
At each SIP session establishment a new, session specific ICID is generated at
the first IMS network element that processes the session-initiating SIP INVITE
message. Enhanced MSC server will generate an ICID for ICS and SRVCC
originated calls as described in TS 24.229 [204]. This ICID is then used in
all subsequent SIP messages for that session (e.g., 200 OK, (re-)INVITE, BYE
etc.) until the session is terminated.
#### 5.1.2.2A Related ICID
During the process of SRVCC access transfer, the Enhanced MSC server or the
P-CSCF generates an ICID for the target access leg. For the purpose of
charging correlation between the source access leg and the target access leg
when the user is roaming the SCC AS and the ATCF includes the ICID used on the
source access leg as the Related ICID for the target access leg as described
in TS 24.229 [204]. This Related ICID is sent in the 1xx and 2xx responses to
the initial INVITE as described in TS 24.237 [408].
#### 5.1.2.3 Access network charging identifier
The access network charging identifier is the media flow level data shared
among the IMS network elements for one side of the session (either the
originating or terminating side). This information is used to correlate the
access network charging data with the IMS charging data. The access network is
identified by bearer specific correlation identifier, e.g. for Packet Switched
Access (GGSN address and PDP context Identifier) or Fixed Broadband Access
(Multimedia Charging Identifier). The access network charging identifier is
populated in the P-Charging-Vector using the access-network-charging-info
parameter. For further information regarding the composition and usage of the
access-network-charging-info parameter refer to TS 24.229[204] and RFC 7315
[406].
#### 5.1.2.4 Inter Operator Identifier (IOI)
The IOI identifies originating, terminating and transit networks involved in a
session/transaction. The IOI may be generated from each side of
session/transaction to identify the home networks associated with each side.
The orig-ioi and term-ioi parameters of P-Charging-Vector represent the
originating and terminating operator identifiers.
For interconnection scenarios in multi operator environments where one or more
transit operators are between the originating and terminating operator, a list
of Transit IOI values may occur additionally to identify involved transit
operators. Due to operator policy, a transit operator may also hide his
identity by adding a void value. Addition and deletion of transit IOI values
are operator configurable. For further information regarding the composition
and usage of the parameters refer to TS 24.229[204], TS 24.292 [210], and IETF
RFC 7315 [406].
NOTE: No transit networks are expected between the S-CSCF and a 3^rd^ party
application server triggered by the initial filter criteria in the S-CSCF.
#### 5.1.2.5 Void
#### 5.1.2.6 IMS visited network identifier
The IMS visited network identifier identifies the visited network involved in
a session/transaction. The IMS visited network identifier is available in the
SIP P-Visited-Network-ID header of the REGISTER and should be used for all
charging events associated with the user.
### 5.1.3 SDP handling
SDP information on SIP can have two different meanings; SDP offer or SDP
answer. This is captured in the charging information by a SDP-type parameter
that indicates if the SDP Media Component is an SDP offer or SDP answer. SDP
offers can be sent by either the calling or called party and the Media
Initiator Flag identifies who sent the first SDP offer in a SDP negotiation.
SDP can be negotiated more than once in an SIP INVITE or RE-INVITE dialog.
Each occurrence of the List of SDP Media Components in the corresponding CDRs
may include either SDP offer or SDP answer. For the first negotiation, the SDP
answer defines which media are used in the session, therefore it shall be
recorded in case of successful session setup. Additionally the corresponding
SDP offer may be recorded. In case of unsuccessful session setup the SDP offer
may be recorded, if available.
When session re-negotiations occur, multiple occurrences of List of SDP Media
Components may be used to include a series of SDP negotiations in which each
occurrence holds an SDP offer or SDP answer as for the first SDP negotiation.
### 5.1.4 Trigger conditions
This chapter contains the details for trigger conditions listed in table
5.2.1.1 for Offline Charging messages (ACR) and 5.3.1.1 for Online Charging
messages (CCR) triggered by SIP Methods or ISUP Messages for all IMS nodes
except for MRFC and AS.
The I-CSCF and BGCF, which need not be present in the signalling path for
subsequent requests after the first SIP INVITE, do not support session based
charging using ACR [Start, Interim, and Stop]. In these (and only in these)
IMS network elements, successful session set-up completion triggers ACR
[Event]. Use of session based charging when the I-CSCF or the BGCF is call
stateful is not described in this release.
The initial registration, user-initiated reregistration, and user-initiated
de-registration chargeable events relate to SIP REGISTER to trigger ACR
[Event]/CCRs, while network-initiated deregistration event relates to SIP
NOTIFY to trigger ACR [Event]/CCRs provided that subscription to registration
events has been applied (see TS 24.229 [204]).
If at the time when the SIP 200 OK is received only the SDP offer is
available, the CTF may trigger ACR [Start] immediately (subsequent SIP ACK
containing the SDP answer triggers ACR [Interim]) or may trigger ACR [Start]
once the SIP ACK has been received. The precise behaviour shall depend on
operator policy.
### 5.1.5 IMS support of real-time tariff transfer
The TS 29.658 [206] describes the Real-time Transfer of Tariff Information
(RTTI) in SIP. The RTTI may be supported for the requested service (e.g.
tariff information of a value added service residing in the called network or
in a specific Application Server).
According to the procedures described in the TS 29.658 [206], tariff
information may be included in the content body of the following SIP messages:
1xx provisional response or 200 OK at session setup, mid-dialog requests or
responses. The following IMS network elements, IBCF, MGCF, S-CSCF and AS may
pass tariff information and record the tariff information in the corresponding
CDRs for IMS offline charging. For online charging, the AS and the IMS-GWF may
send charging information related to the content body of RTTI message over Ro
interface to the OCS.
The following security mechanisms shall be used for RTTI:
\- IBCF shall accept RTTI information only from trusted IMS networks and
filter out RTTI information from non trusted IMS networks.
\- If RTTI information has to be sent over unsecure domain networks, the
security of the domains interconnection shall rely on Network Domain Security
specifications: TS 33.210 [208] and TS 33.310 [209].
\- The S-CSCF responsible for the handling of RTTI messages shall follow the
common IMS security specification TS 33.203 [207] to protect against malicious
UE that try to bypass the P-CSCF.
### 5.1.6 Served user identification
Subscriber Identifier is an Information Element used in both online and
offline charging information to identify the served user for the specific leg
of an IMS session. A list of Subscription Id(s) for IMS CDR shall contain the
Public user Id(s) for the served user.
In the case when the served user is obtained from the P-Header P-Served-User
(can be available in P-CSCF, S-CSCF and AS) then it shall also be used as
Subscription-Id in both online and offline charging.
### 5.1.7 Single Charging session from AS/ATCF acting as B2BUA
When a session-initiating SIP INVITE message is received by an AS/ATCF, this
AS/ATCF, per application logic needs, acting as a B2BUA, may decide IMS
Charging Identifier (ICID) for the outgoing dialog to be the same as received
or different.
In case the same IMS Charging Identifier (ICID) is preserved between incoming
and outgoing dialog by the AS/ATCF acting as a B2BUA, a single charging
session for both dialogs can be created by this AS/ATCF. This option, refered-
to as "OneChargingSession" in the different descriptions, is applicable per
Operator configuration.
### 5.1.8 Charging support for Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with
Local Breakout
The Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with Local Breakout is described
in the TS 23.228 [201]. The corresponding Charging principles are defined in
the TS 32.240 [1]. In the present document, charging support for the Transit
and Roaming Function (TRF) requisite for Roaming Architecture for Voice over
IMS with Local Breakout is rendered by presuming collocation or standalone.
Figure 5.1.7 shows an example for possible signalling and media flows in a
Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with Local Breakout.

Figure 5.1.7: Signalling and media flows in a Roaming Architecture for Voice
over IMS with Local Breakout (Example)
### 5.1.9 Charging support for Network provided Location information
The Network provided Location information (NetLoc) is described in the TS
23.228 [201] and for emergency service request using PCC-based solutions for
the UE location in mobile networks in TS 23.167 [212]. In some scenarios, an
AS can also detect emergency service and obtain the UE location using HSS-
based solutions in TS 23.167 [212].
Based on operator policies and the availability of the user location
information and/or UE Time Zone from the access network, the solution ensures
that relevant SIP messages contain the correct or up to date information about
the user location information, and/or UE Time Zone provided by the access
network and currently used by the UE.
For the 3GPP access networks, the P‑CSCF can retrieve user location
information and/or UE Time Zone related to the access network currently used
by the UE using PCC mechanisms, as specified in TS 23.203 [213] and TS 29.214
[214] In some scenarios, an AS can also obtain location information using HSS-
based solutions in TS 29.328 [215].
For fixed networks, the P-CSCF is aware of the network provided location
information through signalling with the NASS.
As specified in TS 24.229 [204], clause 7.2A.4.3, the network provided
location information is transported in the SIP P-Access-Network-Info header
with an "np" parameter and indicates details of where the UE is currently
located (i.e., SAI, TAI, RAI, CGI, ECGI or access-specific user location
information) as defined in TS 23.228 [214].
In the defined CDRs, the network provided location information for 3GPP
accesses is directly available in the User Location Info field. For non-3GPP
accesses, the network provided location information should be available in the
Access Network Information field..
### 5.1.9a Charging support for IMS transit scenarios
The IMS transit network scenarios are described in the TS 23.228 [201] and may
require additional functionalities provided by the IMS transit functions. When
residing in a stand-alone entity, the IMS Transit Functions may apply offline
charging. Applicable fields for the IMS transit functions are in table
6.3.2.1.
### 5.1.10 Charging support for TRF
In order to support traffic for the Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS
with Local Breakout, IMS Transit Functions are enhanced with additional
routeing functionality, both combined in a Transit and Roaming Function (TRF)
and defined in TS 23.228 [201]. Depending on the transit operator
configuration, these functions might reside in a stand-alone entity or be
collocated with an existing IMS Network Element.
When residing in a stand-alone entity, the TRF may apply offline charging.
When collocated with an existing IMS Network Element, charging information for
the TRF is combined with charging information of the corresponding IMS Network
Element. Applicable fields are in table 6.3.2.1.
## 5.2 IMS Offline Charging Principles
### 5.2.1 Basic Principles
The offline charging functionality is based on the IMS network nodes reporting
accounting information upon reception of various SIP methods or ISUP messages,
as most of the accounting relevant information is contained in these messages.
This reporting is achieved by sending Diameter _Accounting Requests_ (ACR)
[start, interim, stop and event] from the IMS network elements to the CDF.
The Diameter client uses ACR start, interim and stop in procedures related to
successful SIP sessions. It uses ACR events for unsuccessful SIP sessions and
for session unrelated procedures. Further details are specified in the tables
below and in clause 5.2.2.
It is operator configurable in the nodes for which SIP method or ISUP messages
an _Accounting Request_ is sent. Table 5.2.1.1 describes all possible ACRs
that might be sent from a P‑CSCF, I‑CSCF, S-CSCF, IBCF, MGCF or BGCF. A list
of node specific ACRs, along with the AVPs to be included are detailed in TS
32.299 [50].
The ACRs to be sent from a MRFC are described in table 5.2.1.2.
It is configurable for the operators to enable or disable the generation of an
ACR message by the IMS node in response to a particular \"triggering SIP
method /ISUP message\".

and between UE-1 and UE-3 (see step 1.) in case of successful multi-party call
establishment. This is not shown in the diagram above.
##### 5.2.2.1.11 AS Related Procedures - AS Acting as a Redirect Server
Application servers may support a multitude of services which are not
specified in 3GPP standards. Therefore it is not possible to standardise
charging flows and procedures for those services. However, for all such
services, the AS may apply either event charging, where ACR [event] messages
are generated, or Session Charging, using ACR [start, stop and interim]. The
following clauses depict one example for each of the two scenarios. The first
procedure, AS acting as a redirect server, depicts the \"event\" case, while
the second procedure, AS acting as a voice mail server, depicts the
\"session\" case.
The following figure shows the case where an Application Server acts as a
redirect server. In the figure below, UE-1 sets up a session towards UE-2 but
due to Call Forwarding functionality located in the AS, a new number (to UE-3)
is returned to UE-1. Finally UE-1 sets up the session towards UE-3.
Figure 5.2.2.1.11-1: Message Sequence Chart for AS Acting as a Redirect Server
1\. Sessions initiated by UE-1 towards UE-2.
2\. - 3. Response indicating that session should be redirected towards another

number (UE-3).
8\. Session is initiated by UE-1 towards UE-3.
##### 5.2.2.1.12 AS Related Procedures - AS Acting as a Voice Mail Server
The following figure shows the case where an Application Server acts as a
Voice Mail Server. S-CSCF invokes the AS acting as Voice Mail Server according
to procedure as defined in TS 23.218 [203].
Figure 5.2.2.1.12-1: Message Sequence Chart for AS acting as a Mail Server
1\. AS receives the INVITE from the S-CSCF.
2\. AS acknowledges the initiated Voice Mail session by issuing a 200 OK in
response to the INVITE.

START_RECORD to record start of a voice mail session.
4\. The CDF acknowledges the reception of the _Accounting-Request_ with
_Accounting-Record-Type_ indicating START_RECORD and opens a AS CDR.
5\. Voice mail session release is initiated.
6\. Upon reception of release message AS sends an _Accounting-Request_ with
_Accounting-Record-Type_ indicating STOP_RECORD to record stop of a session in
the AS CDR.

##### 5.2.2.1.13 AS Related Procedures - AS Acting as a SCC AS
The charging requirements for IMS service continuity are specified in TS
23.237 [407].
Alternative "OneChargingSession"option is also reflected in the different
flows description, i.e a single charging session from SCC AS.
###### 5.2.2.1.13.1 UE originating call (PS only or CS only)
In this flow, Call-ID #1 is for access leg and Call-ID #2 is for remote leg.
Figure 5.2.2.1.13.1-1: Message Sequence Chart UE originating call
1\. The SCC session is initiated (an INVITE for IMS, a Call Setup for CS).
2\. After processing at CS/PS intermediate nodes, the resulting INVITE is sent
to the S‑CSCF
3\. The S-CSCF validates the service profile, and invokes any appropriate
service logic required for this user.
4\. The S-CSCF forwards the INVITE request message to the SCC AS, according to
the service origination logic defined by initial Filter Criteria (iFC) in the
subscriber profile of the HSS.
5\. The SCC call is anchored at the SCC AS in the home IMS Domain upon
reception of the SIP Invite (Call-ID# 1).
6-7. The S-CSCF forwards the INVITE request message to the terminating network
(Call-ID #2).
8\. The response 200 OK is transmitted to the S-CSCF in the Originating
network.
9\. Upon reception of the final response, the S-CSCF in the originating
network sends an _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-Record-Type_ indicating
START_RECORD to record SCC call routing and start of a user session/media
component in the S-CSCF CDR.

24\. The session is set up with CS or PS media.
For IMS Emergency session over PS, the same flow applies in the UE serving
Network, between the E-CSCF (instead of S-CSCF) and the EATF (Emergency Access
Transfer Function, instead of SCC AS), with E-CSCF and EATF CDRs opened for
access and remote legs.
EATF (acting as a B2BUA) performs third party call control and is considered
as an AS for the charging description.
###### 5.2.2.1.13.2 UE originating call (PS and CS combined origination)
In this flow, Call-ID #1 is for PS access leg, Call-ID #1\' for CS access leg
and Call-ID #2 for remote leg.
Figure 5.2.2.1.13.2-1: Message Sequence Chart UE originating call
1\. UE‑1 wants to initiate a multimedia session with UE‑2 with speech
components carried on CS bearers and non-speech components carried on PS
bearers. Therefore the multimedia session is split into two parts, each one
corresponding to a separate access leg. UE‑1 initiates the establishment of
the first access leg by sending an INVITE request with non-speech media
components. The INVITE contains STI information indicating that a second
access leg (with the speech component) will be originated from the CS domain.
2\. The S‑CSCF executes any service logic as appropriate.
3\. The S‑CSCF sends the INVITE to the SCC AS. The SCC AS identifies that this
access leg has to be correlated to a subsequent access leg based on the STI
information in the INVITE.
4\. UE‑1 request to set up call with CS bearer. The called party number is set
to an identifier such as a PSI DN, which is used to indicate to the SCC AS
that this access leg is to be combined with a PS leg. The DN is either
statically configured on the UE or assigned to the UE by the network upon IMS
Registration.
5\. After processing at ICS/Interworking nodes, the resulting INVITE is sent
to the S‑CSCF.
6\. The S‑CSCF executes any service logic as appropriate.
7\. The S‑CSCF sends the INVITE to the SCC AS. The SCC AS identifies that this
CS leg has to be correlated to a PS leg based on the iFC in the INVITE.

##### 5.2.2.1.19 Support of Optimal Media Routing (OMR)
Optimal Media Routing (OMR) relies on IMS-ALG function enhancement, used by
some IMS Nodes as described in TS 23.228 [201] Annex Q, when performing media
functions at transport level such as firewall or NAT, or application level
such as transcoding. The purpose of optimal media routing (OMR) is to identify
and remove unnecessary media functions from the media path for each media
stream associated to a session. The OMR procedures are applicable to the
following IMS entities having IMS-ALG function used in a B2BUA mode:
  * P-CSCF for support of NAT for signalling and media (with IMS-ALG/IMS-AGW model as described in TS 23.228 [201]) Annex G)
  * IBCF for border Control Functions towards other IMS/SIP Networks (with IBCF/TrGW model as described in TS 23.228 [201] Annex I)
  * Any AS performing as a B2BUA controlling media resources
Although the different TS 23.228 [201] scenarios mainly address the IBCF/TrGW,
they are also applicable to P-CSCF/ IMS-AGW, except for transcoding function
which relates to IBCF only. Consequently, in the different flows, the "GW"
stands for TrGW or IMS-AGW, according to the situation.
The following flows focus on one IMS Node behaviour, embedding such IMS-ALG
function supporting OMR, when involved in some of OMR scenarios described in
TS 23.228 [201] Annex Q.
Each media line of the same session can be applied with separate OMR decision
(i.e different optimised paths), however, for simplification, only one media
is assumed in the following call flows.
In the Figure, the "Originating side" may be an Originating UA or another IMS-
ALG in the same IMS Network, or another IMS Network, and the "Destination
side" may be a Terminating UA or another IMS-ALG in the same IMS Network, or
another IMS Network.
###### 5.2.2.1.19.1 IMS-ALG Related Procedures for OMR -- Session
establishment and IMS-ALG bypasses its local GW
The following figure shows the session establishment with SDP offer/answer
exchange from Originating side towards a Destination side, traversing an IMS
Network Node including IMS-ALG function supporting OMR, and OMR results in
IMS-ALG bypasses its local GW.
Figure 5.2.2.1.19.1-1: Message Sequence Chart for Session establishment with
IMS-ALG supporting OMR and IMS-ALG bypasses its local GW due to OMR process.
1\. IMS-ALG receives an INVITE with SDP offer-inc (call-ID#-inc) from
Originating side, containing the transport address allocated in realm R1 by
the Originating side for the media on incoming leg, and potential OMR
information from prior user plane segments.
2\. IMS-ALG determines the outgoing IP realm (R2) is different from the
incoming IP realm (R1) and interacts with a GW in order to allocate a local
transport address for the media on outgoing leg, in realm R2.
3\. IMS-ALG generates INVITE towards Destination side (call-ID#-out), with a
new SDP offer-out including such local transport address, and also OMR
extensions (for the segment locally handled, along with those received from
prior user plane segments) for further OMR decisions.
4\. The destination side answers with 200 OK and SDP answer-out, with the
transport address allocated by the destination side for the media on outgoing
leg, as result of OMR processing (based on OMR information provided in step
3). This transport address is in realm R1, thus identifying the local GW to be
bypassed (i.e same IP realm as in step 1), and also identifying use of a
different IP realm from the default one (i.e R2).
5\. The Local GW is de-allocated (release of resource allocated in step 2 in
realm R2).
6\. IMS-ALG forwards the SDP answer-inc for the media on incoming leg, with
this transport address received in step 4.
7\. IMS-ALG sends _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-Record-Type_
indicating START_RECORD to record start of session with "Local GW Not
Inserted" and "IP realm Not Default"" indications for the media.
8-9. The CDF opens a session CDR for the IMS Node and acknowledges the
reception of the data.
10\. A user plane connection is now established in realm R1 without GW
insertion for the media.

establishment and alternate IP realm is selected
The following figure shows the session establishment with SDP offer/answer
exchange from Originating side towards Destination side, traversing an IMS
Network Node including IMS-ALG function supporting OMR, and OMR results in
alternate IP realm selection (i.e not the default IP realm) for the media.

Originating side, containing the transport address allocated in realm R1 by
the Originating side for the media on incoming leg, and potential OMR
information from prior user plane segments.
2\. IMS-ALG determines the outgoing IP realm (R2) is different from the
incoming IP realm (R1) and interacts with a GW1 in order to allocate a local
transport address for the media on outgoing leg, in realm R2. IMS-ALG
additionally interacts with GW2 in order to allocate an alternate local
transport address for the media in realm R3.
3\. IMS-ALG generates INVITE towards Destination side (call-ID#-out), with a
new SDP offer-out including such local transport addresses, and also OMR
extensions (for the segment locally handled, along with those received from
prior user plane segments) for further OMR decisions.
4\. The destination side answers with 200 OK and SDP answer-out, with the
transport address allocated by the destination side for the media on outgoing
leg, as result of OMR processing (based on OMR information provided in step
3).This transport address is in realm R3, thus identifying the local GW2 to be
retained, and also identifying use of a different IP realm from the default
one (i.e R2).
5\. The GW1 is de-allocated (release of resource allocated in step 2 for realm
R2), and interaction occurs with GW2 to maintain the user plane connection via
R3.
6\. IMS-ALG1 forwards the SDP answer-inc, with the transport address allocated
by the GW2 in realm R1, for the media on incoming leg.
7\. IMS-ALG sends _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-Record-Type_
indicating START_RECORD to record start of session with "Local GW Inserted"
and "IP realm Not Default" indications for the media.
8-9. The CDF opens a session CDR for the IMS Node and acknowledges the
reception of the data.
10a-b. A user plane connection is now established in realm R1 up to the GW2,
and in realm R3 from the GW2 for the media.
###### 5.2.2.1.19.3 IMS-ALG Related Procedures for OMR -- Mid-session
procedure
The following figure shows a scenario when a new SDP offer/answer exchange due
to UE generating a SIP (re‑)iNVITE or SIP UPDATE in mid-session in order to
add a media component , and the OMR procedures is processed for this new
media, with same situation as in 5.2.2.1.19.1 (IMS-ALG bypasses its local GW).
This scenario also applies for situations where a (re‑)iNVITE or a SIP UPDATE
is issued for updating a media and the OMR procedures is processed again,
changing the established media path.

exceptions:
1 and 3: a Re-INVITE instead of INVITE
7\. IMS-ALG sends _Accounting-Request_ with _Accounting-Record-Type_
indicating INTERIM_RECORD to record update of session with "Local GW Not
Inserted" and "IP realm Not Default" indications for the media.
8-9. The CDF updates the session CDR for the IMS Node and acknowledges the
reception of the data.
###### 5.2.2.1.19.4 IMS-ALG Related Procedures for OMR -- transcoding
As described in TS 23.228 [201] Annex Q, transcoding is also part of OMR
process.
The following flows show session establishment with SDP offer/answer exchange
from Originating side towards a Destination side, traversing an IMS Network
Node including IMS-ALG function supporting OMR with transcoder inserted by
this IMS Node.
Although transcoding aspect is part of the same SDP Offer/Answer different
exchanges described in sub-clause 5.2.2.1.19.1 to sub-clause 5.2.2.1.19.3,
therefore combined in OMR process, it is reflected here through dedicated
flows for simplification.
These procedures apply to IBCF/TrGW only.

#### 5.2.2.2 Message Flows - Error Cases and Scenarios
This clause describes various error cases and how these should be handled. The
error cases are grouped into the following categories:
• Failure in SIP related procedures:
\- Session Related error scenarios;
\- Session Unrelated error scenarios.
• Errors in Diameter (Accounting) related procedures.
##### 5.2.2.2.1 Session Related SIP procedures- Reception of SIP error
messages
A SIP session is closed abnormally by the reception of a BYE message
indicating the reason for such termination.
In this case, an ACR [stop] message that includes an appropriate error
indication is sent.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Session Related SIP procedures - SIP session failure
All nodes involved in the SIP session are expected to exercise some kind of
session supervision. In case a node detects an error in the SIP session, such
as a timeout or the occurrence of an invalid SIP message that results in the
inability to maintain the session, this IMS node will generate a BYE message
towards both ends of the connection.
The node that sent the BYE to trigger session termination identifies the cause
of the failure in the ACR [stop] towards the CDF. All other nodes, i.e. those
that receive the BYE, are not aware of an error, and therefore they treat this
situation as any normal SIP session termination.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 Session Unrelated SIP procedures
As described in clause 5.1.2.1.2, a session unrelated SIP procedure may either
be completed with the reception of a 200OK, or a SIP error message. If the
latter occurs, i.e. there is a failure in the procedure, the ACR [event] sent
towards the CDF includes an appropriate error indication.
##### 5.2.2.2.4 CDF connection failure
When the connection towards the primary CDF is broken, the process of sending
accounting information should continue towards a secondary CDF (if such a CDF
is configured). For further CDF connection failure functionality, see clause
\"_Transport Failure Detection_ \" in IETF RFC 3588 [401].
If no CDF is reachable the network element may buffer the generated accounting
data in non-volatile memory. Once the CDF connection is working again, all
accounting messages stored in the buffer is sent to the CDF, in the order they
were stored in the buffer.
##### 5.2.2.2.5 No reply from CDF
In case an IMS node does not receive an ACA in reply to an ACR, it may repeat
the ACR message. The waiting time until a repetition is sent, and the maximum
number of repetitions are both configurable by the operator. When the maximum
number of repetitions is reached and still no ACA reply has been received, the
IMS node executes the CDF connection failure procedure as specified above.
If retransmitted ACRs are sent, they are marked with the T-flag as described
in IETF RFC 3588 [401] , in order to allow duplicate detection in the CDF, as
specified in the next clause.
##### 5.2.2.2.6 Duplicate detection
A Diameter client marks possible duplicate request messages (e.g.
retransmission due to the link failover process) with the T-flag as described
in IETF RFC 3588 [401].
If the CDF receives a message that is marked as retransmitted and this message
was already received, then it discards the duplicate message. However, if the
original of the re-transmitted message was not yet received, it is the
information in the marked message that is taken into account when generating
the CDR. The CDRs are marked if information from duplicated message(s) is
used.
##### 5.2.2.2.7 CDF detected failure
The CDF closes a CDR when it detects that expected Diameter ACRs for a
particular SIP session have not been received for a period of time. The exact
behaviour of the CDF is operator configurable.
### 5.2.3 CDR generation
Editor's Note: FFS
### 5.2.4 GTP' record transfer flows
GTP' is not used between CDF and CGF for IMS offline charging because CDF and
CGF are combined into CCF (see clause 4.2).
NOTE: Vendors may nevertheless implement a separate CDF and CGF for IMS
offline charging. In this case, it is recommended that the approach chosen
conforms to the principles and protocol applications specified in TS 32.295
[54].
### 5.2.5 Bi CDR file transfer
The CGF will receive charging events from each AS involved in a SIP dialog.
This may result in multiple CDRs, some of these CDRs may be redundant for
billing purposes. When preparing these CDRs for the BD, the CGF may elect not
to send some CDRs or may perform consolidation before transfer based on the
operator\'s configuration.
## 5.3 IMS Online Charging Scenarios
### 5.3.1 Basic Principles
IMS online charging uses the Credit Control application that is specified in
TS 32.299 [50].
Three cases for online charging are distinguished:
• Immediate Event Charging (IEC); and
• event charging with unit reservation (ECUR), and
  * Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR)
Both stage 2 and stage 3 mechanisms for the three cases for online charging
are detailed in TS 32.299 [50].
In the case of Immediate Event Charging (IEC), granting units to the IMS
network element is performed in a single operation that also includes the
deduction of the corresponding monetary units from the subscriber\'s account.
The charging process is controlled by the corresponding credit control request
which is sent for a given credit control event.
In contrast, Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) also includes the
process of requesting, reserving, releasing and returning unused units for
events. The deduction of the corresponding monetary units then occurs upon
conclusion of the ECUR transaction. In this case, the credit control request
is used to control the credit control session.
Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR) is used for credit control of
sessions. SCUR also includes the process of requesting, reserving, releasing
and returning unused units for sessions, and the deduction of the
corresponding monetary units. During a SIP session there can be repeated
execution of unit reservation and debit operations as specified in TS 32.299
[50].
The IMS network element may apply IEC, where CCR event messages are generated,
or ECUR, using CCR Initial, and Termination or SCUR. The decision whether to
apply IEC, ECUR or SCUR is based on the service and/or operator\'s policy.
The CTF uses CCR Initial, Update, Terminate in procedures related to
successful SIP sessions. It uses CCR events (Event or Initial, Terminate
depending on whether IEC or ECUR/SCUR applies) for unsuccessful SIP sessions
and for session unrelated procedures. Further details are specified in the
tables below.
It is operator configurable in the nodes for which SIP method a _Credit
Control Request_ is sent. The table below describes all possible CCRs that
might be sent from an IMS GWF or an MRFC or an application server.
It is configurable for the operators to enable or disable the generation of a
CCR message by the IMS node in response to a particular \"triggering SIP
method\".

### 5.3.2 Diameter Message Flows and Types
This clause describes the message flows for the event charging procedures on
the Ro interface. The IMS functions providing online charging _via_ the Ro
interface are the S-CSCF with IMS GWF, the AS and the MRFC.
NOTE: The following subclauses only show the scenarios of the S-CSCF with IMS-
GWF case and the AS case. The scenarios of the MRFC are FFS.
#### 5.3.2.1 Immediate Event Charging (IEC)
This clause provides the details of the \"Debit Units\" operation specified in
TS 32.299 [50].
##### 5.3.2.1.1 Message Flows - Successful Cases and Scenarios
###### 5.3.2.1.1.1 IEC -- Debit Units Operation
The transactions that are required on the Ro interface in order to perform IEC
with Debit Units operations are carried out as described in TS 32.299 [50]
where "CTF" refers to IMS network element. The Debit Units operation may
alternatively be carried out prior to, concurrently with or after
service/content delivery. the IMS network element must ensure that the
requested service execution is successful, when this scenario is used.
Editor's Note: Must be aligned with TS 32.299 [50].
###### 5.3.2.1.1.2 Scenarios
The following figure shows the Diameter credit control transactions that are
required between the IMS-GWF/AS and the OCS for session-unrelated IMS
procedures, i.e. those that relate to the CCR [event], as listed in Table
5.3.1.
SIP messages and Diameter transactions associated with these charging
scenarios are shown primarily for general information and to illustrate the
charging triggers. They are not intended to be exhaustive and depend on the
Diameter Credit Control Requests triggers configured by the operator.
##### **Scenario 1: Successful session unrelated case**
{#scenario-1-successful-session-unrelated-case .H6}
NOTE: The Debit Units operation is carried out prior to service/content
delivery.
1) A session unrelated SIP Request (e.g. SUBSCRIBE) is received in the S-CSCF.
The S-CSCF forwards this request to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) The IMS-GWF/AS sends a Debit Unit Request (CC-Request-Type=EVENT_REQUEST)
to the OCS, requesting units in order to provide the service.
3) The OCS sends the Debit Unit Response to acknowledge the Debit Unit
Request, granting the requested units.
4) The IMS-GWF/AS and the S-CSCF forward the SIP Request.
Figure 5.3.2.1.1.2-1 : Message Sequence Chart for Session-Unrelated Procedure
##### 5.3.2.1.2 Message Flows - Error Cases and Scenarios
This clause describes various error cases and how these should be handled.
The failure handling behaviour is locally configurable in the IMS network
element. If the _Direct-Debiting-Failure-Handling_ AVP is not used, the
locally configured values are used instead.
###### 5.3.2.1.2.1 Reception of SIP Error Messages
If SIP errors in SIP response (4xx, 5xx or 6xx) occur during service delivery,
as defined in TS 24.228 [202] and TS 23.218 [203], it is up to the IMS network
element to determine to what extent the service was delivered before the error
occurred and act appropriately with respect to charging. This may imply that
no units at all (or no more units) are debited.
###### 5.3.2.1.2.2 Debit Units Operation Failure
This case comprises situations where either no, or an erroneous response, is
received from the OCS. The "no response" case is detected by the IMS network
element when the connection supervision timer Tx expires (IETF RFC 4006 [402])
before a response _Credit-Control-Answer_ (CCA) is received. The case of
receiving an erroneous response implies that the IMS network element receives
a _Credit-Control-Answer_ (CCA), which it is unable to process, while Tx is
running. The failure handling complies with the failure procedures for
\"Direct Debiting\" scenario described in IETF RFC 4006 [402].
###### 5.3.2.1.2.3 Duplicate Detection
The detection of duplicate request is needed and must be enabled. To speed up
and simplify as much as possible the duplicate detection, the all-against-all
record checking should be avoided and just those records marked as potential
duplicates need to be checked against other received requests (within a
reasonable time window) by the receiver entity.
The IMS network element marks the request messages that are retransmitted
after a link failover as possible duplicates with the T-flag as described in
[201]. For optimized performance, uniqueness checking against other received
requests is only necessary for those records marked with the T-flag received
within a reasonable time window. This focused check is based on the inspection
of the _Session-Id_ and _CC-Request-Number_ AVP pairs.
#### 5.3.2.2 Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) and Session Charging
with Unit Reservation (SCUR)
This clause provides the details of the \"Reserve Units\" and \"Debit Units\"
operation specified in TS 32.299 [50].
##### 5.3.2.2.1 Message Flows - Successful Cases and Scenarios
###### 5.3.2.2.1.1 ECUR and SCUR - Reserve Units and Debit Units Operations
The transactions that are required on the Ro interface in order to perform
ECUR/SCUR with Reserve Units and Debit Units operations is carried out as
described in TS 32.299 [50] where "CTF" refers to an IMS network element.
Multiple replications of both of these operations are possible.
###### 5.3.2.2.1.2 Expiration of Reservation Validity
This clause defines how reserved units are returned, if not used, within a
reasonable time. It should be possible that both, reservation and SIP sessions
are cancelled or only the reservation is cancelled without removing the SIP
session.
###### 5.3.2.2.1.3 Scenarios
The following figure shows the Diameter credit control transactions that are
required between the IMS-GWF/AS and the OCS for session-related and session-
unrelated IMS procedures.
The SIP messages and Diameter transactions associated with these charging
scenarios are shown primarily for general information and to illustrate the
charging triggers. They are not intended to be exhaustive and they depend on
the Diameter Credit Control Requests triggers configured by the operator.
###### # 5.3.2.2.1.3.1 Session Related Procedures (SCUR)
**Scenario 1: Successful Session Establishment**
The following figure shows the Diameter credit control transactions that are
required in the IMS-GWF/AS during a SIP session establishment.
1) An initial SIP Invite Request is received in the S-CSCF. This request is
forwarded to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) The IMS-GWF/AS sends a Reserve Unit Request (CC-Request-Type
=INITIAL_REQUEST) to the OCS requesting service units. The online credit
control session is initiated.
3) The OCS grants units in the Reserve Unit Response.
4) The IMS-GWF/AS and S-CSCF forward the initial INVITE.
5) A final response is received in the IMS-GWF/AS.
6) If the trigger is active, the 200 OK answer triggers a Reserve Unit Request
(CC-Request-Type =UPDATE_REQUEST) in the IMS-GWF/AS in order to update the
credit control session. New service units are requested. Also the used service
units (if any) are reported.
7) The OCS sends the Reserve Unit Response to acknowledge the Reserve Unit
Request. New service units are granted.
8) The final answer is forwarded.
    Figure 5.3.2.2.1.3.1-1: Message Sequence Chart for Successful
    Session Establishment
**Scenario 2 : Successful Session Establishment with Early Media Negotiation**
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required in the
IMS-GWF/AS during a SIP session establishment in which SDP negotiation is
completed before a final response to the initial INVITE is exchanged.
1) An initial SDP offer is conveyed in a SIP INVITE message. The SIP INVITE
message received in the S-CSCF is forwarded to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) In this example, the SDP offer is conveyed in a SIP request which implies
the start of the online session towards the OCS. The IMS-GWF/AS sends a
Reserve Unit Request (CC-Request-Type =INITIAL_REQUEST) to the OCS requesting
service units. The online credit control session is initiated.
3) The OCS grants units in the Reserve Unit Response.
4) The IMS-GWF/AS and S-CSCF forward the SIP Request conveying the SDP offer.
5) A non-final SIP message (e.g. a provisional reliable response) conveying an
SDP answer is received in the IMS-GWF/AS.
6) The received SDP answer triggers a Reserve Unit Request (CC-Request-Type
=UPDATE_REQUEST) in order to update the credit control session. New service
units are requested. Also the used service units (if any) are reported.
7) The OCS sends the Reserve Unit Response to acknowledge the Reserve Unit
Request. New service units are granted.
8) The SDP answer is forwarded.

Early Media Negotiation
**Scenario 3 : Mid-Session Procedures**
The figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required in the IMS-GWF/AS
when receiving a SIP Re-iNVITE in mid-session, e.g. in order to modify media
component(s), or when the hold and resume procedure is executed.
1) A SIP RE-INVITE request is received in the S-CSCF. This request is
forwarded to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) Upon receiving the SIP RE-INVITE request, the IMS-GWF/AS sends a Reserve
Unit Request (CC-Request-Type = UPDATE_REQUEST) to update the previously
initiated credit control session. New service units are requested. The used
service units (if any) are also reported.
3) The OCS grants new service units in the Reserve Unit Response.
4) The RE-INVITE request is forwarded.
5) The RE-INVITE request is acknowledged with a 200 OK.
6) If the trigger is active, the IMS-GWF/AS sends a Reserve Unit Request (CC-
Request-Type =UPDATE_REQUEST) to the OCS to update the credit control session.
New service units are requested. The used service units (if any) are also
reported.
7) The OCS grants new service units in the Reserve Unit Response.
8) The 200 OK message is forwarded.

    Procedures
**Scenario 4: Session Release**
The following figure shows the Diameter transactions that are required in the
IMS-GWF/AS for a session release scenario.
1) A SIP session is released by sending a SIP BYE message. The S-CSCF forwards
this message to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) Upon receiving the BYE message, the IMS-GWF/AS forwards the SIP BYE request
to the UE.
3) In case there is an ongoing online control session, the IMS-GWF/AS sends a
Reserve Unit Request (CC-Request-Type =TERMINATION_REQUEST) reporting the used
granted units.
4) The OCS sends a Reserve Unit Response. The online credit control session is
terminated.
5) The final answer to the Bye message is forwarded.

**Scenario 5: Successful Session Establishment with reception of RTTI
message**
The following figure shows the Diameter credit control transactions that are
required in the IMS-GWF/AS during a SIP session establishment when RTTI
message is received embedded in the SIP 200 OK.
1) An initial SIP Invite Request is received in the S-CSCF. This request is
forwarded to the IMS-GWF/AS.
2) The IMS-GWF/AS sends a Reserve Unit Request (CC-Request-Type
=INITIAL_REQUEST) to the OCS requesting service units. The online credit
control session is initiated.
3) The OCS grants units in the Reserve Unit Response.
4) The IMS-GWF/AS and S-CSCF forward the initial INVITE.
5) A final response is received in the IMS-GWF/AS, which embeds a RTTI XML
body.
6) If the trigger is active, the 200 OK answer triggers a Reserve Unit Request
(CC-Request-Type =UPDATE_REQUEST) in the IMS-GWF/AS in order to update the
credit control session and take into account the RTTI XML body within the SIP
200 OK (see NOTE). New service units are requested. Also the used service
units (if any) are reported.
7) The OCS sends the Reserve Unit Response to acknowledge the Reserve Unit
Request. New service units are granted.

If SIP errors occur during service delivery, as defined in [202] and [203], it
is up to the IMS network element to determine to what extent the service was
delivered before the error occurred and act appropriately with respect to
charging. This may imply that no units at all (or no more units) are reserved
or debited.
###### 5.3.2.2.2.2 Reserve Units and Debit Units Operation Failure
This case comprises of OCS connection failure, and/or receiving error
responses from the OCS.
The IMS network element detects an OCS connection failure when the timer Tx
expires (IETF RFC 4006 [402]) or a transport failure is detected as defined in
IETF RFC 3588 [401]. The OCS also has the capability to detect failures when
the timer Ts (IETF RFC 3588 [401]) expires. The OCS should indicate the cause
of failure by setting the appropriate result code as defined in IETF RFC 3588
[401] and IETF RFC 4006 [402]. In any case, the failure handling of IMS
network element and OCS complies with the failure procedures for session based
credit control scenario described in IETF RFC 4006 [402].
###### 5.3.2.2.2.3 Duplicate Detection
For credit control duplicate detection is performed only for possible
duplicate event requests related to IEC as mentioned in clause 5.3.2.1.2.3, as
retransmission of ECUR/SCUR related credit control requests is not allowed.
###### 5.3.2.2.2.4 Aborted Session Setup
If a trigger occurs during session establishment to release a session during
the establishment procedure, the IMS Network Element shall initiate procedures
to cancel the session establishment as defined in TS 24.229 [204].\ On
completion of the cancellation procedure, the IMS Network Element shall close
the credit-control session (for SCUR and ECUR) indicating an appropriate cause
code.
#### 5.3.2.3 IMS Service Termination by OCS
Annex B describes several scenarios related to IMS service termination.
NOTE: The annex B only shows the scenario of the S-CSCF with IMS-GWF case.
For IMS session related scenarios charged by means of SCUR in the IMS-GWF,
Service Termination shall imply the rejection of a request for IMS session
establishment or the release of an established session that is possibly
associated to an online Diameter Charging Session.
For IMS session unrelated scenarios charged by means of ECUR in the IMS-GWF,
Service Termination shall imply the rejection of the SIP method triggering the
Reserve Unit Request as defined in TS 32.299 [50].
For IMS session unrelated scenarios charged by means of IEC prior to
service/content delivery in the IMS-GWF, Service Termination shall imply the
rejection of the SIP method triggering the Debit Unit Request as defined in TS
32.299 [50].
##### 5.3.2.3.1 Triggers on Ro interface which imply the termination of the
IMS service
The procedures in Ro interface which may trigger the IMS Service termination
are the following:
\- Reception of an unsuccessful Operation Result different from
DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE (TS32.299 [50]) in the Debit and
Reserve Unit Response message.
\- Reception of an unsuccessful Result Code different from
DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE (TS32.299 [50]) within the Multiple
Unit Operation in the Debit and Reserve Unit Response message when only one
instance of the Multiple Unit Operation field is used.
\- Execution of the Termination Action procedure as defined in TS32.299 [50]
when only one instance of the Multiple Unit Operation field is used.
\- Execution of the Failure Handling Procedures when the Failure Action is set
to 'Terminate' or 'Retry & Terminate'.
\- Reception in the IMS-GWF of an Abort-Session-Request Message from OCS.
In case either a Final-Unit-Indication or an erroneous Result-Code at Multiple
Unit Operation level trigger the IMS service termination and the charging is
based on ECUR or SCUR, the IMS-GWF shall close the Diameter online session by
sending a Debit Units and Reserve Units operation of Type 'Termination'.
Refer to TS 32.299 [50] for a detailed description of these procedures.
##### 5.3.2.3.2 Indication to the UE of the reason for IMS service release
As a result of Service Termination triggering in IMS-GWF, the IMS service
shall be denied to end-users. The network should provide an indication to UEs
of the reason the service has been released or rejected. The procedure shall
depend on:
\- The charged party.
The network should provide UEs with an indication of the reason the service
has been released or rejected. However, this reason shall depend on whether
the UE is the charged party or not. The premise is that only the charged party
should know that the IMS service is being rejected / released because of OCS
interaction.
\- IMS specific protocol issues as defined in TS 24.229 [204].
a) The IMS-GWF generates a non-2xx final SIP response as a result of the IMS
Service Termination procedure:
In this scenario, the Response Code of the SIP response shall indicate the
server understood the request but is refusing to fulfil it and that this
request should not be repeated. The SIP response may include additional
information about the cause to reject/release the IMS service. The presence of
this additional error information in the response shall be operator
configurable.
The additional information included in the SIP response may contain a SIP URI.
The UE may treat the SIP URI as if it were a Contact in a redirect and
generate a new INVITE, resulting, for example, in a recorded announcement
session being established.
b) The IMS-GWF generates a SIP request (e.g. SIP BYE or SIP CANCEL) as a
result of the IMS Service Termination procedure:
In this scenario, the IMS-GWF may include a 'Reason' field in the request
which provides additional information about the cause to reject/release the
IMS service. The presence of this additional information in the request shall
be operator configurable.
> In both scenarios, it shall also be operator configurable both per SIP
> Method and per Originating/Terminating side, the content of the additional
> error information sent to the UEs. This error information shall also be
> configurable based on the procedure in Ro interface which has triggered the
> release/rejection of the IMS service according to clause 5.3.2.3.1. In
> particular when the Service Termination is triggered by the reception of an
> unsuccessful Operation Result (different from
> DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE as defined in TS 32.299 [50]) in the
> Debit and Reserve Unit Response message or the reception of an unsuccessful
> Result Code (different from DIAMETER_CREDIT_CONTROL_NOT_APPLICABLE as
> defined in TS 32.299 [50]) within the Multiple Unit Operation in the Debit
> and Reserve Unit Response message, the additional error information/reason
> shall also be configurable based on the Result Code received through Ro
> interface.
# 6 Definition of charging information
## 6.1 Data description for IMS offline charging
### 6.1.1 Rf Message contents
The IMS nodes generate accounting information that can be transferred from the
CTF to the CDF. For this purpose, IMS offline charging utilises the _Charging
Data Transfer_ that is specified in the 3GPP accounting application described
in TS 32.299 [50].
The _Charging Data Transfe_ r operation employs the _Charging Data Request_
and _Charging Data Response_ messages. The following table describes the use
of these messages for offline charging.

### 6.1.3 CDR Description on the Bi Interface
#### 6.1.3.1 CDR Field Types
The following Standard CDR content and format are considered:
S-CSCF-CDR generated based on information from the S-CSCF
I-CSCF-CDR generated based on information from the I-CSCF
P-CSCF-CDR generated based on information from the P-CSCF
BGCF-CDR generated based on information from the BGCF

TRF-CDR generated based on information from the TRF
ATCF-CDR generated based on information from the ATCF
The content of each CDR type is defined in the tables in clauses 6.1.3.3 to
6.1.3.11. For each CDR type the field definition includes the field name,
category and description. The detailed field descriptions are provided in TS
32.298 [51].
Editor's Note: Equipment vendors shall be able to provide all of the fields
listed in the CDR content table in order to claim compliance with the present
document. However, since CDR processing and transport consume network
resources, operators may opt to eliminate some of the fields that are not
essential for their operation.
Editors note: Rephrase the above paragraph and ref. to 32.240
The CDF provides the CDRs at the Bi interface in the format and encoding
described in TS 32.298 [51]. Additional CDR formats and contents may be
available at the interface to the billing system to meet the requirements of
the billing system, these are outside of the scope of 3GPP standardisation.
#### 6.1.3.2 CDR Triggers
##### 6.1.3.2.1 Session related CDRs
Reflecting the usage of multimedia sessions IMS CDRs are generated by the CDF
on a per session level. In the scope of the present document the term
\"session\" refers always to a SIP session. The coherent media components are
reflected inside the session CDRs with a media component container comprising
of all the information necessary for the description of a media component.
Accounting information for SIP sessions is transferred from the CTF involved
in the session to the CDF using Charging Data Request start, interim and stop
messages. A session CDR is opened in the CDF upon reception of a Charging Data
Request [start] message. Partial CDRs may be generated upon reception of a
Charging Data Request [interim] message, which is sent by the network entity
towards the CDF due to a session modification procedure (i.e. change in
media). Session CDRs are updated, or partial CDRs are generated upon reception
of a Charging Data Request [Interim] message, which is sent by the network
entity due to expiration of the Charging Data Interim Interval. The CDF closes
the final session CDR upon reception of a Charging Data Request [stop]
message, which indicates that the SIP session is terminated. Further details
on triggers for the generation of IMS CDRs are specified in [1].
Accounting information for unsuccessful session set-up attempts may be sent by
the CTF to the CDF employing the Charging Data Request [event] message. The
behaviour of the CDF upon receiving Charging Data Request [event] messages is
specified in clause 6.1.3.2.2.
##### 6.1.3.2.2 Session unrelated CDRs
To reflect chargeable events not directly related to a session the CDF may
generate CDRs upon the occurrence of session unrelated SIP procedures, such as
registration respectively de-registration events. Accounting information for
SIP session-unrelated procedures is transferred from the IMS nodes involved in
the procedure to the CDF using Charging Data Request [event] messages. Session
unrelated CDRs are created in the CDF in a \"one-off\" action based on the
information contained in the Charging Data Request [event] message. One
session unrelated CDR is created in the CDF for each Charging Data Request
[event] message received, whereas the creation of partial CDRs is not
applicable for session unrelated CDRs. The cases for which the IMS nodes send
Charging Data Request [event] messages are listed per SIP procedure in table
5.2.1.1 and table 5.2.1.2.
Further details on triggers for the generation of IMS CDRs are specified in
clause 5.2.2.
#### 6.1.3.3 S-CSCF CDR Content

## 6.2 Data description for IMS online charging
### 6.2.1 Ro message contents
The IMS nodes generate debit and reserve units information that can be
transferred from the CTF to the OCF. For this purpose, IMS online charging
utilises the _Debit Units and Reserve Units_ procedure that is specified in
the 3GPP debit unit operation in TS 32.299 [50].
The _Debit and reserve units_ procedure employs the _Debit and Reserve Units
Request_ and _Debit and Reserve Units Response_ messages. Table 6.2.1
describes the use of these messages in IMS online charging.

### 6.3.2 Detailed Message Format for offline charging
The following chapter specifies per Operation Type the charging data that are
sent by each of the IMS network elements for:
  * IMS session and IMS event (S/I/S/E)
  * S-CSCF, E-CSCF, P-CSCF, MGFC, AS, IBCF, TRF, ATCF, TF
  * IMS session only (S/I/S)
  * MRFC
  * IMS event only (E)
  * I-CSCF, BGCF
The Operation Types are listed in the following order: S (start)/I (interim)/S
(stop)/E (event). Therefore, when all Operation Types are possible it is
marked as SISE. If only some Operation Types are allowed for a node, only the
appropriate letters are used (i.e. SIS or E) as indicated in the table
heading. The omission of an Operation Type for a particular field is marked
with \"-\" (i.e. SI-E). Also, when an entire field is not allowed in a node
the entire cell is marked as \"-\".
Table 6.3.2.1 illustrates the basic structure of the supported fields in the
Charging Data Request message for IMS offline charging.

### 6.3.3 Detailed Message Format for online charging
The following table specifies per Operation type the charging data that are
sent by each of the IMS network elements for:
  * IMS session and IMS event (I/U/T/E)
```{=html}
``` \- IMS-GWF, AS
```{=html}
``` \- IMS session only (I/U/T)
```{=html}
``` \- MRFC
The Operation types are listed in the following order: I (initial)/U
(update)/T (terminate)/E (event). Therefore, when all Operation types are
possible it is marked as IUTE. If only some Operation types are allowed for a
node, only the appropriate letters are used (i.e. IUT or E) as indicated in
the table heading. The omission of an Operation type for a particular field is
marked with \"-\" (i.e. IU-E). Also, when an entire filed is not allowed in a
node the entire cell is marked as \"-\".
Note that not for all structured fields the individual field members are
listed in the table. Detailed descriptions of the fields are provided in TS
32.299 [50].

###### ## Annex B (informative): Message Flows for Service Termination by OCS
This annex describes several scenarios related to IMS service termination in
IMS-GWF.
SIP messages and Diameter transactions associated with these charging
scenarios are shown primarily to illustrate the service termination
procedures. They are not intended to be exhaustive and depend on the Diameter
Credit Control Requests triggers configured by the operator. The triggers for
sending Debit and Reserve Unit Requests from the IMS-GWF to the OCS are
defined according to table 5.3.1.
## B.1 Scenario 1 - Session Related (SCUR): Service Termination on reception
of an initial SIP INVITE Request
Figure B.1.1 : Service Termination triggered by an initial SIP Request
## B.2 Scenario 2 - Session Related (SCUR): Service Termination triggered
after an early SIP Dialog is established
Figure B.2.1: Service Termination triggered by the 200OK response to the
initial INVITE
Figure B.2.2 : Service Termination triggered by an UPDATE request within an
early SIP dialog
Figure B.2.3 : Service Termination triggered by the 200OK to an UPDATE request
within an early SIP dialog
## B.3 Scenario 3 - Session Related (SCUR): Service Termination triggered
after a confirmed SIP Dialog is established
Figure B.3.1 : Service Termination triggered by a re-INVITE request within a
confirmed SIP dialog
Figure B.3.2: Service Termination triggered by the 200OK response to a re-
INVITE request within a confirmed SIP dialog
Figure B.3.3 : Service Termination triggered by the Charging Application
procedures as defined in TS 32.299 [50] within a confirmed SIP dialog
## B.4 Scenario 4 - Session Unrelated (ECUR): Service Termination on reception
of an initial SIP non-INVITE Request
Figure B.4.1 : Service Termination triggered by the reception of a non-INVITE
SIP request
## B.5 Scenario 5 - Session Unrelated (IEC): Service Termination on reception
of an initial SIP non-INVITE Request
