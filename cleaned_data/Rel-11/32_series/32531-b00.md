For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TS 32.101 [2], TS 32.102 [3] and TS 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term
defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the
same term, if any, in TS 32.101 [2], TS 32.102 [3] and TS 21.905 [1], in that

## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Software Management:** Activities to control which software is available
and/or active in a network element.
**Automated Software Management:** Software Management which is performed
without the presence of an IRPManager (SWM). An IRPManager may monitor and /or
control the software management activities. An IRPAgent\ receives information
to perform the Software Management activities in an autonomous way.\ \ **Non-
Automated Software Management:** Software Management which requires the
presence of IRPManager (SWM) to fully control and monitor the software
management activities. The IRPAgent receives explicit instructions from the
IRPManager about the SW Management activities which shall be performed.
**Software Installation:** Installation of software puts it into a form
suitable for activation or use.
**Software Activation** : Activation of software makes it ready to be used and
the software starts providing service.
