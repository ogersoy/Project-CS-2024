# Introduction
The present document is part of a multi-part TS covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication Management; Partial Suspension of Itf-N Integration
Reference Point (IRP), as identified below:
32.381: \"Partial Suspension of Itf-N Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Requirements\".
32.382: \"Partial Suspension of Itf-N Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Information Service (IS)\"..
**32.386: \"Partial Suspension of Itf-N Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Solution Set (SS) definitions\".**
The present document describes the requirements and information model
necessary for Telecommunication Management (TM). The TM principles and TM
architecture are specified in 3GPP TS 32.101 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [3].
Information of an event is carried in notification. An IRPAgent (typically an
EM or a NE) emits notifications (see 3GPP TS 32.302 [16]. IRPManager
(typically a network management system) receives notifications. In certain
scenarios floods of unwanted notifications including alarms will be sent to
the IRP manager by network object instances. Thereby the interface and the
management systems bear unnecessary load. Even worse: The operator's awareness
is drawn away from really urgent events.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the SOAP SS for the IRP whose semantics is
specified Partial Suspension of Itf-N IRP IS (3GPP TS 32.382 [5]).
This Solution Set specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.382 V11.0.X.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1], 3GPP TS 32.101 [2], 3GPP TS 32.102 [3], 3GPP TS 32.150 [4],
3GPP TS 32.382 [5] apply. A term defined in the present document takes
precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
**IRP:** See 3GPP TS 32.101 [2].
**IRPAgent:** See 3GPP TS 32.102 [3].
**IRPManager:** See 3GPP TS 32.102 [3].
**Suspended notification:** See 3GPP TS 32.382 [5].
**Itf-N suspended managed instance:** See 3GPP TS 32.382 [5].
**Partial suspension of Itf-N:** See 3GPP TS 32.382 [5].
**XML file:** file containing an XML document.
**XML document:** composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration
followed by a root XML element [8].
**XML declaration:** it specifies the version of XML being used, see [8].
**XML element:** has a type, is identified by a name, may have a set of XML
attribute specifications and is either composed of the succession of an XML
start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element followed by an XML
end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag; each XML element may
contain other XML elements, see [8].
**empty XML element:** having an empty XML content; an empty XML element still
possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an empty XML element is
either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag directly followed by an
XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag, see [8].
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag, see [8].
**XML start-tag:** the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute specifications
of the XML element, see [8].
**XML end-tag:** the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an XML end-
tag containing the name of the XML element, see [8].
**XML empty-element tag:** composed simply of an empty-element tag containing
the name and the set of XML attribute specifications of the XML element, see
[8].
**XML attribute specification:** has a name and a value, see [8].
**DTD:** defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML
document to be valid with regard to this DTD, see [8].
**XML schema:** more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema defines structure and
content constraints to be respected by an XML document to conform with this
XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML schemas can be used
together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself also an XML
document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas, see [9], [10]
and [11].
**XML namespace:** enables qualifying element and attribute names used in XML
documents by associating them with namespaces identified by different XML
schemas, see [9], [10] and [11].
**XML complex type:** defined in an XML schema; cannot be directly used in an
XML document; can be the concrete type or the derivation base type for an XML
element type or for another XML complex type; ultimately defines constraints
for an XML element on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML content,
see [9], [10] and [11].
**XML element type:** declared by an XML schema; can be directly used in an
XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element, directly or indirectly
defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML
content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base type for another
XML element type, see [9], [10] and [11].

# C.2 Mapping
## C.2.1 Operation and notification mapping
The Partial Suspension of Itf-N Integration Reference Point (IRP) IS (3GPP TS
32.382 [5]) defines semantics of operation and notification visible across the
Itf-N. Table C.2.1 indicates mapping of these operations and notifications to
their equivalents defined in this SS.
Table C.2.1: Mapping from IS Operation to SS Equivalents
* * *
IS Operations in 3GPP TS 32.382 [5] SS Operations SS Port Qualifier
setPartialSuspensionOfItfN setPartialSuspensionOfItfN PartialSuspensionPort M

readActivePartialSuspensionsOfItfN PartialSuspensionPort O
notifyChangeOfPartialSuspensionOfItfN notify (note 1) NotificationIRPNtfPort M
NOTE 1: The IS equivalent maps to an XML definition specified in Annex B, and
this being an input parameter to the operation notify under the port type
ntfIRPNtfSystem:NotificationIRPNtf and under the binding
ntfIRPNtfSystem:NotificationIRPNtf of 3GPP TS 32.306 [17].

## C.2.2 Operation parameter mapping
The Partial Suspension of Itf-N Integration Reference Point (IRP) IS (3GPP TS
32.382 [5]) defines semantics of parameters carried in the operations. The
tables below show the mapping of these parameters, as per operation, to their
equivalents defined in this SS.

# C.3 Solution Set definitions
## C.3.1 WSDL definition structure
Clause C.3.2 provides a graphical representation of the Partial Suspension of
Itf-N IRP service.
Clause C.3.3 defines the services which are supported the Partial Suspension
of Itf-N IRP agent.
## C.3.2 Graphical Representation
The WSDL structure is depicted in Figure C.3.2 below, depicting port type,
binding and service. The port type contains port type operations, which again
contains input, output and fault messages. The binding contains binding
operations, which have the same name as the port type operations. The binding
connects to a port inside the service.
