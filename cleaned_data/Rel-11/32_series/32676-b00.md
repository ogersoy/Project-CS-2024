Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of a deployment program (e.g. additions
and deletions), as part of an optimisation program (e.g. modifications), and
to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM actions are initiated
either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G network, or as part of a
complex procedure involving actions on many resources/objects in one or
several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Solution Set (SS) definitions for the IRP
whose semantics is specified in State Management IRP: Information Service (IS)
(3GPP TS 32.672 [1]).
This Solution Set definitions specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.672
V11.0.X.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions defined in
3GPP TS 32.672 [2] apply, and the following XML terms and definitions apply:
**XML file:** file containing an XML document
**XML document:** composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration
followed by a root XML element
NOTE: See [7]; in the scope of the present document.
**XML declaration:** it specifies the version of XML being used
NOTE: See [7].
**XML element:** has a type, is identified by a name, may have a set of XML
attribute specifications and is either composed of the succession of an XML
start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element followed by an XML
end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag; each XML element may
contain other XML elements
NOTE: See [7].
**empty XML element:** having an empty XML content; an empty XML element still
possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an empty XML element is
either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag directly followed by an
XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag
NOTE: See [7].
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag
**XML start-tag:** the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute specifications
of the XML element
NOTE: See [7].
**XML end-tag:** the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an XML end-
tag containing the name of the XML element
NOTE: See [7].
**XML empty-element tag:** composed simply of an empty-element tag containing
the name and the set of XML attribute specifications of the XML element
NOTE: See [7].
**XML attribute specification:** has a name and a value
NOTE: See [7].
**DTD:** defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML
document to be valid with regard to this DTD
NOTE: See [7].
**XML schema:** more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema defines structure and
content constraints to be respected by an XML document to conform with this
XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML schemas can be used
together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself also an XML
document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas
NOTE: See [8], [9] and [10].
**XML namespace:** enables qualifying element and attribute names used in XML
documents by associating them with namespaces identified by different XML
schemas
NOTE: See [11], in the scope of the present document.
**XML complex type:** defined in an XML schema; cannot be directly used in an
XML document; can be the concrete type or the derivation base type for an XML
element type or for another XML complex type; ultimately defines constraints
for an XML element on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML content
NOTE: See [8], [9] and [10].
**XML element type:** declared by an XML schema; can be directly used in an
XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element, directly or indirectly
defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML
content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base type for another
XML element type
NOTE: See [8], [9] and [10].

## 3.3 IRP document version number string
The IRP document version number (sometimes called \"IRP version\" or \"version
number\") string is used to identify this specification. The definition of
\"IRP document version number string\" in 3GPP TS 32.311 [1] provides the rule
to derive such a string.
As the State Management IRP IS as defined in 3GPP TS 32.672 [2] does not
specify operations & notification (only State Management related data
definitions), this string definition is stated here for potential future use
only.
# 4 Solution Set definitions
This specification defines the following 3GPP State Management IRP Solution
Set definitions:
  * 3GPP State Management IRP CORBA SS (Annex A)
  * 3GPP State Management IRP XML definitions (Annex B)
###### ## Annex A (normative): CORBA Solution Set
# A.1 Architectural Features
The overall architectural feature of State Management IRP is specified in 3GPP
TS 32.672 [2].
This clause specifies features that are specific to the CORBA SS.
## A.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
The syntax of a Distinguished Name is defined in 3GPP TS 32.300 [13].
# A.2 Mapping
## A.2.1 IOC Mapping
Table 1 provides the mapping of the information object classes defined in the
IS of the State Management IRP [2] to the equivalent of this CORBA Solution
Set.

State Management IRP [2] to their equivalents in this CORBA Solution Set. As

###### ## Annex B (normative): XML definitions
This annex specifies the XML file format definition for the Bulk Configuration
Management IRP IS [5] for the IRP whose semantics is specified in State
Management IRP: Information Service (IS) (3GPP TS 32.672 [2]).
Bulk CM XML file formats are based on XML [7], XML Schema [8] [9] [10] and XML
Namespace [11] standards.
# B.1 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of State Management IRP is specified in 3GPP
TS 32.672 [2].
This clause specifies features that are specific to the XML Schema
definitions.
## B.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
The syntax of a Distinguished Name is defined in 3GPP TS 32.300 [13].
# B.2 Mapping
Not present in the current version of this specification.
# B.3 Solution Set definitions
## B.3.1 XML definition structure
The overall description of the file format of configuration data XML files is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [6].
Clause B.3.2 defines the XML schema stateManagementIRP.xsd for the State
Management IRP: Information Service (IS) defined in 3GPP TS 32.672 [2].
The definition of the XML element types complies with the generic mapping
rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [6].
