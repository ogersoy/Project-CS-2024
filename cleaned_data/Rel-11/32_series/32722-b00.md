# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:

Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
CM, in general, provides the operator with the ability to assure correct and
effective operation of the 3G network as it evolves. CM actions have the

and they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the OSs or NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
\"Repeater Network Resources IRP\", through which an \"IRPAgent\" (typically
an Element Manager or Network Element) can communicate Configuration
Management information to one or several \"IRPManagers\" (typically Network
Managers) concerning Repeater resources. The \"Repeater Network Resources
IRP\" comprises a set of specifications defining Requirements, a protocol
neutral Network Resource Model (NRM) and corresponding Solution Set(s).
The present document specifies the protocol neutral Repeater Network Resources
IRP: Network Resource Model.\ It reuses relevant parts of the generic NRM in
TS 32.622 [10] and 32.642 [5], either by direct reuse or sub-classing, and in
addition to that defines Repeater specific Information Object Classes.
The Configuration Management (CM) area is very large. The intention is to
split the specification of the related interfaces in several IRPs -- as
described in the Introduction clause above. An important aspect of such a
split is that the Network Resource Models (NRMs) defined in different IRPs
containing NRMs are consistent, and that NRMs supported by an IRPAgent
implementation can be accessed as one coherent model through one IRP
Information Service (IS).
To summarize, the present document has the following main purpose: to define
the applied Repeater specific NRM, based on the generic NRM in 3GPP TS 32.622
[10].
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an IRP IS is needed,
such as the Basic CM IRP IS (3GPP TS 32.602[11]) or the Bulk CM IRP IS (3GPP
TS 32.612 [12]). However, which IS that is applicable is outside the scope of
the present document.

# 3 Definition and Abbreviation
## 3.1 Definition
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply. For terms and definitions not found here, please refer to 3GPP TS
32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.600 [8].
**Repeater:** A device that receives, amplifies and transmits the radiated or
conducted RF carrier both in the down-link direction (from the base station to
the mobile area) and in the up-link direction (from the mobile to the base
station).
**Association** : In general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
(1) [name bindings]{.underline},
(2) [reference attributes]{.underline}, and
(3) [association objects]{.underline}.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams).
**Managed Element (ME)** : An instance of the Information Object Class
ManagedElement defined in TS 32.622 [10].
**Managed Object (MO)** : In the context of the present document, a Managed
Object (MO) is a software object that encapsulates the manageable
characteristics and behaviour of a particular Network Resource. The MO is
instance of a MO class defined in a MIM/NRM. This class, called **Information
Object Class (IOC)** has [attributes]{.underline} that provide information
used to characterize the objects that belong to the class (the term
\"attribute\" is taken from TMN and corresponds to a \"property\" according to
CIM). Furthermore, the IOC can have [operations]{.underline} that represent
the behaviour relevant for that class (the term \"operation\" is taken from
TMN and corresponds to a \"method\" according to CIM). The IOC may support the
emission of [notifications]{.underline} that provide information about an
event occurrence within a network resource.
**Management Information Model (MIM)** : Also referred to as NRM -- see the
definition below.
**Network Resource Model (NRM)** : A model representing the actual managed
telecommunications network resources that a System is providing through the
subject IRP. An NRM identifies and describes the IOCs, their associations,
attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as \"MIM\" (see above),
which originates from the ITU-T TMN.

# 4 Modelling approach
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
\"Repeater Network Resources IRP\", through which an \"IRPAgent\" (typically
an Element Manager or Network Element) can communicate Configuration
Management information to one or several \"IRPManagers\" (typically Network
Managers) concerning UTRAN resources. The \"UTRAN Network Resources IRP\"
comprises a set of specifications defining Requirements, a protocol neutral
Network Resource Model (NRM) and corresponding Solution Set(s).
The modelling approach used in this IRP is described in 32.622 [10] Generic
Network Resources IRP; NRM.
This model allows for combined managed element functionality, where more than
one \"function IOC\" (inherited from ManagedFunction) modelling more specific
managed element functionality may be contained in the ManagedElement IOC.
