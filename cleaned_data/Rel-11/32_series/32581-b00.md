-within the IPsec Tunnel with the option to utilise SSL/TLS within the IPsec Tunnel for additional end-to-end security
TR-069 CPE devices are currently factory programmed with a Bootstrap HMS URL
only and therefore the HNB capable CPEs requiring to utilise IPsec for

Security Gateway/IPsec Information or this information is supplied outside of
the IPsec tunnel before tunnel establishment utilising SSL/TLS.
