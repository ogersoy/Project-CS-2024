# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.690: Inventory Management (IM); Requirements
32.691: Inventory Management (IM) network resources Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Requirements
32.692: Inventory Management (IM) network resources Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Network Resource Model (NRM)
**32.696: Inventory Management (IM) network resources Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions**
Inventory Management (IM), in general, provides the operator with the ability
to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it evolves. IM
actions have the objective to monitor the actual configuration on the Network
Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and they may be initiated by the
operator or by functions in the Operations Systems (OSs) or NEs. The final
goal of IM is the establishment of an accurate and timely model of the actual
inventory in the NEs or NRs.
The present document covers the Inventory Management (IM) Network Resource
Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP): solution set definitions.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the NRM-specific part related to the Inventory
Management NRM IRP IS in 3GPP TS 32.692 [1] of solution set definitions.
This Solution Set definitions specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.692
V110..X.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**XML file:** file containing an XML document
**XML document:** composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration
followed by a root XML element
NOTE: See [4]; in the scope of the present document.
**XML declaration:** it specifies the version of XML being used
NOTE: See [4].
**XML element:** has a type, is identified by a name, may have a set of XML
attribute specifications and is either composed of the succession of an XML
start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element followed by an XML
end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag; each XML element may
contain other XML elements
NOTE: See [4].
**empty XML element:** having an empty XML content; an empty XML element still
possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an empty XML element is
either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag directly followed by an
XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag
NOTE: See [4].
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag
**XML start-tag:** the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute specifications
of the XML element.
NOTE: See [4].
**XML end-tag:** the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an XML end-
tag containing the name of the XML element
NOTE: See [4].
**XML empty-element tag:** an empty XML element is composed simply of an
empty-element tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute
specifications of the XML element
NOTE: See [4].
**XML attribute specification:** has a name and a value
NOTE: See [4].
**DTD:** defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML
document to be valid with regard to this DTD
NOTE: See [4].
**XML schema:** more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema defines structure and
content constraints to be respected by an XML document to conform with this
XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML schemas can be used
together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself also an XML
document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas
NOTE: See [5], [6] and [7].
**XML namespace:** enables qualifying element and attribute names used in XML
documents by associating them with namespaces identified by different XML
schemas
NOTE: See [8], in the scope of the present document.
**XML complex type:** defined in an XML schema; cannot be directly used in an
XML document; can be the concrete type or the derivation base type for an XML
element type or for another XML complex type; ultimately defines constraints
for an XML element on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML content
NOTE: See [5], [6] and [7].
**XML element type:** declared by an XML schema; can be directly used in an
XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element, directly or indirectly
defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML
content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base type for another
XML element type
NOTE: See [5], [6] and [7].

# 4 Solution Set definitions
This specification defines the following 3GPP Inventory Management (IM)
network resources IRP Solution Set definitions:
  * 3GPP Inventory Management (IM) network resources IRP NRM XML definitions (Annex A)
CORBA Solution Set is not present in the current version of this
specification.
###### ## Annex A (normative): XML definitions
This annex provides the NRM-specific part related to the Inventory Management
NRM IRP IS in 3GPP TS 32.692 [1] of the XML file format definition for the
Bulk Configuration Management IRP IS in 3GPP TS 32.612 [2] as well as for use
with File Tranfer IRP [10].
# A.1 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of Inventory Management NRM IRP IS is
specified in 3GPP TS 32.692 [1].\ This clause specifies features that are
specific to the XML Schema definitions.
## A.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
The syntax of a Distinguished Name is defined in 3GPP TS 32.300 [9].
# A.2 Mapping
Not present in the current version of this specification.
# A.3 Solution Set definitions
## A.3.1 XML definition structure
The overall description of the file format of inventory data XML files is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [3].
A.3.2 defines the NRM-specific XML schema inventoryNrm.xsd for the Inventory
Management NRM IRP IS alternative 1 defined in 3GPP TS 32.692 [1].
A.3.3 defines the NRM-specific XML schema inventoryNrmAlt2.xsd for the
Inventory Management NRM IRP IS alternative 2 as defined in 3GPP TS 32.692
[1].
XML schema inventoryNrmAlt1.xsd and inventoryNrmAlt2.xsd explicitly declare
NRM-specific XML element types for the related NRM.
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [3].
## A.3.2 XML schema \"inventoryNrm.xsd\"
The following XML schema inventoryNrm.xsd is the NRM-specific schema for the
Inventory Management NRM IRP IS alternative 1 defined in 3GPP TS 32.692 [1].
