The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor 3G-system.
During the lifetime of a 3G network, its logical and physical configuration
will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise
the utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed
through network configuration management activities and/or network
engineering, see 3GPP TS 32.600 [3].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a 3G network require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document is to describe the mechanisms
involved in the collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements of IMS.
3GPP TS 32.401 [5] describes Performance Management concepts and requirements.
The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of an IMS network. These may be measurement types defined
within the present document, measurements defined within other standards
bodies, or vendor specific measurement types.
Only measurement types that are specific to IMS network are defined within the
present documents. I.e. vendor specific measurement types and measurements
related to \"external\" technologies used in IMS network, such as ATM or IP,
are not covered. Instead, these could be applied as described by the other,
\"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) or according to
manufacturer\'s documentation.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to CSCF);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. Registration related measurements);
\- Header 3: Measurements.
# 2 References

###### ## Annex A (normative): Use cases for performance measurements
defintion
The present Annex provides the concrete use cases for the IMS performance
measurements defined in the present specification.
# A.1 Use case of Immediate Messaging procedure related measurements at CSCF
IMS users shall be able to exchange immediate messages with each other by
using the Immediate Messaging procedure. CSCF may delivery successfully the
immediate messages, also may refuse the immediate messages or respond to the
sender with fail indications.If the Immediate Messaging procedure at CSCF is
fail, the users' subjective feel to the network will be bad.So it is necessary
to define Immediate Messaging procedure related measurements for operator to
evaluate the rate of success and failure at CSCF in IMS network.
# A.2 Use case of IP-CAN Session Establishment related measurements
IP-CAN session is a main procedure in policy and charging control architecture
(see 3GPP TS 29.213 [33]). If IP-CAN session establishment is failed, it means
that PCEF cannot get PCC rules from PCRF and PCEF shall reject the attempt for
UE-initiated resource request. So it is necessary to define IP-CAN session
establishment related measurements to monitor or evaluate session performance
of PCC procedures.
# A.3 Use case of emergency session related measurements
Emergency session function is an important function at E-CSCF. The emergency
session related measurements can help operator to evaluate the emergency
session processing capacity and performance of IMS network entity, analyze the
establishement failure reasons of emergency session and solve the problems.
Especially the mean successful emergency session establishment time could
reflect the quality of emergency session establishment directly and help
operator to do network optimization.The emergency session establishment
procedure may not comply with the emergency configuration policy, and these
measurements can be used to check the effectiveness of the policy.
# A.4 Use case of CDIV service related measurements
The **Communications Diversion (CDIV)** service is an important supplementary
service. It can divert user to another destination in the communication.The
**CDIV** services mainly include Communication Forwarding Unconditional (CFU),
Communication Forwarding on Busy user (CFB), Communication Forwarding on no
Reply (CFNR), Communication Forwarding on Subscriber Not Reachable (CFNRc),
Communication Forwarding on Not Logged-in (CFNL) and Communication Deflection
(CD). The **Communications Diversion (CDIV)** service related measurements at
AS can provide information on the usage of CDIV service in the network such as
how much the CDIV services is used. The measurements are subject to network
operator bussiness community which could help operator to make necessary
actions accordingly, e.g. enhance or intorduce more similar services or stop
certain services depending on their usage amount to ensure the target
financial result of their company.
# A.5 Use case of OIP and OIR service related measurements
**The Originating Identification Presentation (OIP) is an important**
supplementary service. It **provides the terminating user with the possibility
of receiving the identity information to identify the originating user.** The
OIR service enables the originating user to prevent presentation of its
identity information to the terminating user. The OIP/OIR service related
measurements at AS can provide information on the usage of OIP/OIR service in
the network such as how much the OIP/OIR service is used. The measurements are
analyzed by the operator business community to help the operator take
necessary actions according to the following, e.g. enhance or intorduce more
similar services or stop certain services depending on their usage to meet the
operator's requirements.
# A.6 Use case of successful session establishments of inter-network domains
When inter-network domain calling occurred,not only the number of attempted
session establishment but also successful session establishment is essential.
If the successful session has not been established, it means that the attempt
for inter-network calling has been rejected.This measurement can be used to
caculate the rate of successful seesion, it will reflect the connectivity
status of both network of inter-network domain calling, and also can infulence
the feeling of users directly. So it is necessary to define successful session
establishments to monitor or evaluate session performance of inter-network
calling.
# A.7 Use case of Gateway Control Session Establishment related measurements
Gateway Control session is a main procedure in policy and charging control
architecture (see 3GPP TS 29.213 [33]). If Gateway Control session
establishment is failed, it means that BBERF cannot get PCC rules from PCRF
and BBERF shall reject the attempt for UE-initiated resource request, the
whole procedure will terminate. So it is necessary to define Gateway Control
session establishment related measurements to evaluate session performance of
PCC procedures and help the trouble shooting.
# A.8 Use case of Accumulated session time related measurements at CSCF
Accumulated session time which is an important aspect of network load could
reflect the call traffic. It also reflects occupancy of session traffic in
relation to system resource and may help operators to decide whether the
network capacity expansion or network configuration adjustment is needed.
# A.9 Use case of Equipment related measurements
Equipment related measurements help operators to monitor the equipment related
usage and make related operation and maintenance. Memory usage is one of the
important items in equipment related measurements.The mean memory usage
related measurements are used to observe the usage of the memory and help to
determine whether to expand memory.
# A.10 Use case of session control related measurement per access technology
Measurements on the attempt times, the success times and the failure times of
all sessions establishment per different access technologies may help
operators be aware of the users\' behavior (times and frequency) on accessing
IMS domain via different access technologies. The access success ratio to IMS
can be obtained by the division of the access successful times and attempted
times. The successful rate of session establishment per access technology to
the IMS network is significant to operators on operation and maintainence.
# A.11 Use case of CW related measurements
Call Waiting (CW) service is an important supplementary service. The
Communication Waiting (CW) service enables a UE to be informed that no
resources are available for an incoming communication. The user then has the
choice of accepting, rejecting or ignoring the incoming communication. The
Call Waiting (CW) service related measurements at AS could provide information
on the usage of CW service in the network such as how much the CW service is
used. The measurement is subject to network operator bussiness community which
could help operator to make necessary actions accordingly, e.g. enhance or
intorduce more similar services or stop certain services depending on their
usage amount to ensure the target financial result of their company.
# A.12 Use case of Hold service related measurements
HOLD service is an important supplementary service. The Communication
Hold(HOLD) supplementary service enables a user to suspend the reception of
media stream(s) of an established IP multimedia session, and resume the media
stream(s) at a later time. The Communication Hold (HOLD) service related
measurements at AS could provide information on the usage of HOLD service in
the network such as how much the HOLD service is used. The measurement is
subject to network operator bussiness community which could help operator to
make necessary actions accordingly, e.g. enhance or intorduce more similar
services or stop certain services depending on their usage amount to ensure
the target financial result of their company.

provisioned or configured conditions on behalf of the originating user. The
ICB service makes it possible for a user to have barring of certain categories
of incoming communications according to a provisioned or user configured
barring program and is valid for all incoming communications. The Anonymous
Communication Rejection (ACR) is a particular case of the ICB service that
allows barring of incoming communications from an anonymous originator on
behalf of the terminating user.The CB and ACR services related measurements at
AS can provide information on the usage of CB and ACR services in the network
such as how much the CB and ACR services is used. The measurements are subject
to network operator bussiness community which could help operator to make
necessary actions accordingly, e.g. enhance or intorduce more similar services
or stop certain services depending on their usage amount to ensure the target
financial result of their company.
# A.14 Use case of HSS related measurements
HSS interacts with CSCF, AS, MME and SGSN via different interface with
UAR/SAR/RTR/LIR/PPR/MAR/SNR/UDR/ULR/CLR/PUR/IDR/DSR/AIR/RSR/NOR procedures.
The measurements regarding to the total request received by HSS and the total
response sent to other NEs are significant to know about performance and load
balance of HSS.
# A.15 Use case of the number of release before ringing and the number of
release while ringing at CSCF in session control related measurements
The number of release before ringing and the number of release while ringing
reflect user behaviour factors different from the failure procedure. Sometimes
unsuccessful session establishment is caused by user\'s own behaviour which
has nothing to do with network performance. Therefore the user behaviour
factors should be measured and excluded to evaluate the real network session
establishment success rate. These two measurements are used to support the
KPI: "Session Establishment Network Success Rate".
# A.16 Use case of TIP and TIR service related measurements
The Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP) and Terminating
Identification Restriction (TIR) are important supplementary services. The TIP
service provides the originating party with the possibility of receiving
