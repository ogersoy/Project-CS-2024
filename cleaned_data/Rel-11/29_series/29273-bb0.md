# 4 SWa Description
## 4.1 Functionality
### 4.1.1 General
The SWa reference point is defined between the untrusted non-3GPP IP access
and the 3GPP AAA Server or Proxy. The definition of the reference point and
its functionality is given in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3].
The SWa reference point is optionally used to authenticate and authorize the
UE for the access to the EPS. It is up to the non-3GPP operator's policy
whether this interface and the procedures defined in this section are used.
NOTE: From the EPS operator\'s view, the tunnel authentication and
authorization procedures described in clause 7 (SWm description) and clause 9
are required to ensure the user\'s authentication and authorization when the
UE is attached to an untrusted non-3GPP IP access.
The same procedures as defined for STa reference points are used also in the
SWa, but with reduced message content. As an exception, the service
authorization information update procedure is not applicable for the SWa
reference point.
### 4.1.2 Procedure Descriptions
#### 4.1.2.1 SWa Authentication and Authorization procedure
##### 4.1.2.1.1 General
This procedure follows the STa Authentication and Authorization procedure,
with the following differences:
\- Information elements that would reflect information about the user\'s
service request and about the access network are not included or are optional
in the authentication and authorization request.
\- The information elements that describe the user\'s subscription profile are
not downloaded to the non-3GPP access network.
NOTE: The information elements related to the IP Mobility Mode Selection
function are not supported over this interface.

##### 4.1.2.1.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
The detailed behaviour of the 3GPP AAA Server follows the behaviour defined
for the STa Authentication and Authorization procedure (refer to clause
5.1.2.1.2), with the following deviations:
\- The 3GPP AAA Server shall handle the non-3GPP access network as untrusted.
\- The 3GPP AAA Server marks the trust relationship as \"untrusted\" with the
User Identity.
\- The authentication method shall be selected based on the presence of the
Access Network Identity: if this information element is present, EAP-AKA\'
method is used; otherwise, EAP-AKA method is used
##### 4.1.2.1.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The detailed behaviour of the 3GPP AAA Proxy follows the behaviour defined for
the STa Authentication and Authorization procedure (refer to clause
5.1.2.1.3), with the following exceptions:
\- The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall insert Visited-Network-Identifier AVP before
forwarding the request to the 3GPP AAA Server.
\- The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall handle the non-3GPP access network as untrusted
and marks the trust relationship as \"untrusted\".
On receipt of the authentication and authorization answer that completes a
successful authentication, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall record the authentication
state of the user.
#### 4.1.2.2 SWa HSS/AAA Initiated Detach
This procedure equals with the STa HSS/AAA Initiated Detach procedure, refer
to clause 5.1.2.2.
#### 4.1.2.3 SWa Non-3GPP Access Network Initiated Detach
This procedure equals with the STa Non-3GPP Access Network Initiated Detach
procedure, refer to clause 5.1.2.4.
#### 4.1.2.4 SWa Re-Authentication and Re-Authorization Procedure
##### 4.1.2.4.1 General
This procedure is optional and it may be invoked by the 3GPP AAA Server, if
the operator policies require that the re-authentication of the user for the
SWa is to be renewed and the untrusted non-3GPP access network supports the
re-authentication.
This procedure shall be performed in two steps:
\- The 3GPP AAA server shall issue an unsolicited re-auth request towards the
untrusted non-3GPP access, indicating that both re-authentication and re-
authorization of the user is needed. Upon receipt of such a request, the
untrusted non-3GPP access shall respond to the request and shall indicate the
disposition of the request. This procedure is mapped to the Diameter command
codes Re-Auth-Request and Re-Auth-Answer specified in IETF RFC 3588 [7].
Information element contents for these messages shall be as shown in tables
4.1.2.4.1/1 and 4.1.2.4.1/2.
\- Upon receiving the re-auth request, the untrusted non-3GPP access shall
immediately invoke the SWa authentication and authorization procedure
requesting the identity of the user via EAP and using DER/DEA commands, with
the same session-ID but the content adapted to the needs of a re-
authentication. Information element contents for these messages shall be as
shown in tables 4.1.2.4.1/3 and 4.1.2.4.1/4.
If the re-authentication of the user is not successful, the untrusted non-3GPP
access shall detach the user.

prepended in front of the IMSI used to differentiate between authentication
schemes. Re-Auth Request Type Re-Auth--Request-Type M This information element
shall define whether the user is to be authorized only or authenticated and
authorized. AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE shall be used in this case. Routing
Information Destination-Host M This information element shall be obtained from
the Origin-Host AVP, which was included in a previous command received from
the untrusted non-3GPP access.

##### 4.1.2.4.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Server shall trigger this procedure according to the local
policies configured by the operator.
The 3GPP AAA Server shall use the same authentication method that was used
during the full authentication executed at the UE\'s attach. If EAP-AKA\' is
used, the 3GPP AAA Server shall use the ANID parameter received during the
authentication and authorization executed at the UE attach (refer to clause
4.1.2.1.1).
##### 4.1.2.4.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The detailed behaviour of the 3GPP AAA Proxy follows the behaviour defined for
the STa Re-Authorization and Re-Authentication Procedures (refer to clause
5.1.2.3.3), with the following addition:
\- When forwarding the authorization answer or the authentication and
authorization answer, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall record the authentication state
of the user.
## 4.2 Protocol Specification
### 4.2.1 General
The SWa reference point shall use the same Diameter application as the STa
reference point. The first authentication command exchange (DER/DEA) is common
between the SWa and STa reference points. During this initial exchange, the
3GPP AAA Server determines the HPLMN\'s trust relationship with the non-3GPP
access network and communicates it to the non-3GPP access network and the UE
as described in section 5.1.2.1.2. The contents of the subsequent commands are
dependent on this trust relationship determination and are specific to the SWa
or STa reference points.

# 5 STa Description
## 5.1 Functionality
### 5.1.1 General
The STa reference point is defined between a non-3GPP access network and the
3GPP AAA Server or between a non-3GPP access network and the 3GPP AAA Proxy.
The definition of the reference point and its functionality is given in 3GPP
TS 23.402 [3].
Whether a Non-3GPP access network is Trusted or Untrusted is not a
characteristic of the access network; this decision shall be made during the
access authentication and authorization procedure executed between the
non-3GPP access network and the 3GPP AAA Server. This is implemented by the
STa and SWa reference points sharing the same Diameter application and partly
sharing the same authentication and authorization procedure. The STa and SWa
reference points are clearly distinguished after the exchange of the first
authentication and authorization messages, during which trusted/untrusted
decision is made by the 3GPP AAA server and this decision is communicated to
the non-3GPP access network. The other procedures are specific to the STa and
SWa reference points.
The STa reference point shall be used to authenticate and authorize the UE.
The STa reference point may also be used to transport PMIPv6, GTPv2, or MIPv4
FA-CoA mode related mobility parameters in a case the UE attaches to the EPC
using the S2a reference point. The procedures specified for EPC access via GTP
based S2a are only applicable to trusted WLAN access networks (see clause 16
of 3GPP TS 23.402 [3]).
Additionally the STa reference point may also be used to transport DSMIPv6
related mobility parameters in case the UE attaches to the EPC using the S2c
reference point. In particular, in this case the STa reference point may be
used for conveying the Home Agent IP address or FQDN from the AAA server to
the gateway of the trusted non-3GPP access for Home Agent discovery based on
DHCPv6 (see TS 24.303 [13]).
This reference point shall be also used to transport charging-related
information and optionally information about IP Mobility Mode Selection.
### 5.1.2 Procedures Description
#### 5.1.2.1 STa Access Authentication and Authorization
##### 5.1.2.1.1 General
These procedures are transported over Diameter, the Access (Re-)Authentication
and Authorization between the trusted non-3GPP access network and the 3GPP AAA
Proxy or Server. The STa interface and Diameter application shall be used for
authenticating and authorizing the UE for EPC access in PMIPv6, GTPv2, MIPv4
FA-CoA mode or for TWAN access without EPC S2a access (i.e. non-seamless WLAN
offload) via trusted non-3GPP accesses and non-3GPP accesses that are decided
to be untrusted during the authentication and authorization procedure.
When EAP-AKA\' is used in the STa access authentication and either EPC access
in NBM (PMIPv6 or GTPv2) or TWAN access without EPC S2a access (i.e. non-
seamless WLAN offload) is used, the trusted non-3GPP access network shall
support also the role of the NAS. Specifically in the case where PMIPv6 is
used, the network element of the non-3GPP access network acting as a MAG shall
have also the role of the NAS. During the STa access authentication the NAS
shall serve as pass-through EAP authenticator.
Diameter usage over the STa interface:
\- When EAP is used, the trusted non-3GPP access authentication and
authorization procedure shall be mapped to the Diameter-EAP-Request and
Diameter-EAP-Answer command codes specified in IETF RFC 4072 [5].
\- For (re)authentication procedures, the messaging described below shall be
reused.
During the STa Access Authentication and Authorization procedure the non-3GPP
access network may provide information on its PMIPv6 or GTPv2 capabilities to
the 3GPP AAA Server.
During the STa Access Authentication and Authorization procedure the trusted
non-3GPP access network shall provide information on the Access Network
Identity (ANID) to the 3GPP AAA Server. Specifically the TWAN shall set the
Access Network Identity as specified in subclause 8.1.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.302
[26] for a WLAN access network.
For a trusted non-3GPP access, the 3GPP AAA Server may perform IP mobility
mode selection between NBM and HBM. The 3GPP AAA Server may provide to the
trusted non-3GPP access network an indication if either NBM or local IP
address assignment (for HBM) shall be used.
For a trusted WLAN access, if the user is successfully authenticated and
authorized for this access, the 3GPP AAA Server may either only authorize the
user to access to EPC via S2a (i.e. EPC-routed service only), or only
authorize the user to access the TWAN without granting access to EPC via S2a
(i.e. non-seamless WLAN offload service only), or authorize both EPC-routed
and non-seamless WLAN offload services. The TWAN decides the S2a protocol
variant to use if access to EPC is authorized and the TWAN decides to
establish S2a.
When authorizing NBM to be used, the 3GPP AAA server shall return NBM related
information back to the trusted non-3GPP access network.
During the STa Access Authentication and Authorization procedure, when DSMIPv6
is used, the 3GPP AAA Server may provide a Home Agent IPv6 address (and
optionally IPv4 address) or FQDN to the trusted non-3GPP access network. This
is needed if the DHCPv6 option for Home Agent address discovery is chosen (see
TS 24.303 [13] and IETF RFC 6611 [28]). If the Home Agent IPv6 address or FQDN
is not included in the final Authentication and Authorization Answer by the
3GPP AAA server, the trusted non-3GPP access network shall not assign the Home
Agent via DHCPv6.
During the STa Access Authentication and Authorization procedure for MIPv4 FA-
CoA mode using trusted non-3GPP access, the 3GPP AAA Server may provide the
mobility security parameters FA-RK and FA-RK-SPI to the trusted non-3GPP
access network.
The User-Name AVP may contain a decorated NAI (as defined in clause 19 of 3GPP
TS 23.003 [14]) in a roaming case. In this case the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall
process the decorated NAI and support routing of the Diameter request messages
based on the decorated NAI as described in IETF RFC 5729 [37].
For UEs where the IMSI is not available, the Authentication and Authorization
procedures shall not be used over the STa interface. For UEs receiving
emergency services, where the IMSI is available, the Authentication and
Authorization procedures shall be used, but if they fail, the procedures shall
proceed as if they succeeded on the non-3GPP access network.
For PMIPv6, GTPv2 and MIPv4 FA-CoA mode trusted non-3GPP accesses, upon
mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, for the PDNs the UE is already
connected, the PDN Gateway identity for each of the already allocated PDN
Gateway(s) with the corresponding PDN information is provided to the trusted
non-3GPP system. The PDN Gateway identity is a FQDN and/or IP address of the
PDN GW. The non-3GPP access network shall use the received PDN Gateway
identity for mobility with IP address preservation or in case of static PDN
Gateway assignment. If a FQDN is provided, the trusted non-3GPP system shall
then derive it to IP address according to the selected mobility management
protocol.
NOTE: Mobility with IP address preservation is not supported between TWAN and
3GPP access in this release of the specification.

##### 5.1.2.1.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
On receipt of the first DER message, the 3GPP AAA Server shall check the
validity of the ANID AVP and whether the non-3GPP access network is entitled
to use the included value. The correct syntax of the ANID is checked as
follows:
\- In a non-roaming case, i.e. when the 3GPP AAA Server receives the request
directly and not via the 3GPP AAA Proxy, checking ANID is mandatory;
\- In a roaming case when the request is received via an 3GPP AAA proxy,
checking ANID is optional. The 3GPP AAA Server may decide to check ANID based
on local configuration, e.g. depending on the received visited network
identifier.
\- If the checking result shows that the included ANID value is not valid (not
defined by 3GPP) or that the requesting entity is not entitled to use the
received ANID value, the Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
The 3GPP AAA Server shall check if user data exists in the 3GPP AAA Server
(containing valid authentication information for the current access network
identity). If not, the 3GPP AAA Server shall use the procedures defined in SWx
interface to obtain access authentication and authorization data.
If the 3GPP AAA Server receives a request message not related to any existing
session and is able to recognize that the non-3GPP access GW included the AAA-
Failure-Indication AVP in the request, the 3GPP AAA Server shall also include
the AAA-Failure-Indication AVP over the SWx interface, while retrieving the
access authentication and authorization data from the HSS.
If SWx authentication response indicates that:
\- The user does not exist, then the 3GPP AAA Server shall respond the
non-3GPP access network with Experimental-Result-Code
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN.
\- The user does not have non-3GPP access subscription, then 3GPP AAA Server
shall respond the non-3GPP access network with Experimental-Result-Code
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_NO_NON_3GPP_SUBSCRIPTION.
\- The user is not allowed to roam in the visited network, then 3GPP AAA
Server shall respond the non-3GPP access network with Experimental-Result-Code
DIAMETER_ERROR_ROAMING_NOT_ALLOWED.
\- The user is currently being served by a different 3GPP AAA Server, then the
3GPP AAA Server shall respond to the non-3GPP access network with the Result-
Code set to DIAMETER_REDIRECT_INDICATION and the Redirect-Host set to the
Diameter URI of the 3GPP AAA Server currently serving the user (this Diameter
URI shall be constructed based on the Diameter Identity included in the 3GPP-
AAA-Server-Name AVP returned in the SWx authentication response from the HSS).
\- Any other error occurred, then the error code DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY
shall be returned to the non-3GPP access network.
When SWx authentication response includes the requested authentication
information, the 3GPP AAA Server shall proceed with the authentication and
authorization procedure. The 3GPP AAA Server shall use the procedures defined
in SWx interface to obtain the user\'s subscription profile from HSS.
Before sending out the authentication challenge, the 3GPP AAA Server shall
decide, whether the access network is handled as Trusted or Untrusted. The
3GPP AAA Server shall make the decision based on the Access Network Identifier
and Visited Network Identity information elements, according to its local
policies. The local policies of the 3GPP AAA Server shall be based on the
security criteria described in 3GPP TS 33.402 [19].
NOTE 1: The network operator can configure this e.g. according to the roaming
agreements with the non-3GPP AN operator or with VPLMN operator.
In a roaming case, if the 3GPP AAA Server has received the trust relationship
indicator from the VPLMN (AN-Trusted AVP), the 3GPP AAA Server may use this
information as input parameter to the trusted/untrusted evaluation.
The VPLMN trust relationship indicator may be utilized only if the appropriate
trust relationship exists between the HPLMN and VPLMN operators.
If the 3GPP AAA Server has decided to take the received trust relationship
indicator into account, it shall combine its own decision (taken as described
above) with the received trust relationship indicator in a way that the final
decision shall be \"trusted\" only if both initial decisions were \"trusted\";
otherwise, the final decision shall be \"untrusted\".
Based on the trusted/untrusted decision, the 3GPP AAA Server may send a trust
relationship indication to the UE, as described in 3GPP TS 24.302 [26].
The 3GPP AAA Server shall indicate the trust relationship assessment of the
non-3GPP access network to the UE in the AT_TRUST_IND attribute (in the EAP-
Request/AKA\'-Challenge) as defined in 3GPP TS 24.302 [26]. The 3GPP AAA
Server shall also indicate the trust relationship assessment to the non-3GPP
access network using AN-Trusted AVP in the DEA command.
If the decision is \"Trusted\", the STa authentication and authorization
procedure is executed as described here, in clause 5.1.2.1 and it subclauses.
Otherwise, the SWa authentication and authorization procedure is executed as
described in clause 4.1.2.1.
The 3GPP AAA Server marks the trust relationship as \"trusted\" with the User
Identity. If the 3GPP AAA Server detects that an S6b session already exists
for the corresponding UE and the S6b session was established as a result of an
authentication request for DSMIPv6, the 3GPP AAA Server shall send the trust
relationship to the PDN GW as specified in clause 9.1.2.5.
The 3GPP AAA Server shall run EAP-AKA\' authentication as specified in 3GPP TS
33.402 [19]. Exceptions shall be treated as error situations and the result
code shall be set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
Once authentication is successfully completed, the 3GPP AAA Server shall
perform the following authorization checking (if there is an error in any of
the steps, the 3GPP AAA Server shall stop processing and return the
corresponding error):
1) Check if the user is barred to use the non 3GPP Access. If it is so, then
the Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED
2) Check RAT-Type AVP. If
\- the access type indicates any value not described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [23] or
\- the received RAT-Type is listed in the user\'s disallowed RAT-Types,
this shall be treated as error and the Result-Code DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY
shall be returned.
The following steps are only executed if the non-3GPP access network was
decided to be Trusted.
3) Check if the user has a subscription for the requested APN if present, or
for the wildcard APN. If not, Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_NO_APN_SUBSCRIPTION
4) for a trusted WLAN access (i.e. ANID in the request indicates WLAN, see
subclause 8.1.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.302 [26]), check if the user is authorized to
access to EPC via S2a and/or non-seamless WLAN offload via the selected WLAN:
\- if no TWAN-Access-Info AVP was received from the HSS in the user\'s
subscription, the 3GPP AAA Server shall consider that access to EPC and non-
seamless WLAN Offload is authorized;
\- if one or more TWAN-Access-Info AVP(s) was received from the HSS in the
user\'s subscription:
\- if the TWAN has signalled the selected Trusted WLAN in the request and the
selected Trusted WLAN identifier contains only the SSID of the selected WLAN,
the 3GPP AAA Server shall authorize the access methods allowed by the TWAN-
Access-Info AVP explicitly matching the selected trusted WLAN (i.e. including
a WLAN-Identifier AVP with the same SSID and without HESSID information) if
any;
NOTE 2: When the TWAN does not include the HESSID in the request, the
authorization information in the 3GPP AAA Server containing both SSID and
HESSID is not applicable; therefore, in order to get specific authorization of
the UE in this case, the operator needs to define authorization information
for the SSID in question (without HESSID), or to rely on the \"wildcard\"
authorization (i.e., a TWAN-Access-Info AVP not including a WLAN-Identifier
AVP).
\- if the TWAN has signalled the selected Trusted WLAN in the request and the
selected Trusted WLAN identifier contains both the SSID and the HESSID of the
selected WLAN, the 3GPP AAA Server shall authorize the access methods allowed
by the TWAN-Access-Info AVP explicitly matching the selected trusted WLAN
(i.e. including a WLAN-Identifier AVP with the same SSID and same HESSID);
> Else, if no match is found, the 3GPP AAA Server shall authorize the access
> methods allowed by the TWAN-Access-Info AVP explicitly matching the HESSID
> of the selected Trusted WLAN identifier (i.e. TWAN-Access-Info including a
> WLAN-Identifier AVP with the same HESSID and without SSID information);

\- otherwise, if the selected Trusted WLAN does not match explicitly any of
the TWAN-Access-Info or if TWAN has not signalled the selected Trusted WLAN
Identifier, the 3GPP AAA Server shall apply the access methods allowed by the
\"wildcard\" TWAN-Access-Info AVP (i.e. TWAN-Access-Info AVP not including a
WLAN-Identifier AVP) if any;
\- otherwise, if the \"wildcard\" TWAN-Access-Info is not present, the 3GPP
AAA Server shall consider that access to EPC and non-seamless WLAN Offload is
not authorized.
5) Check if the user is not authorized to perform non-seamless WLAN Offload
and, if the user is also barred from using the subscribed APNs, then the
Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED.
6) If present, check the flags of the received MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP:
\- If the MIP6-INTEGRATED flag is set and the 3GPP AAA Server has authorized
DHCP Home Agent assignment, the 3GPP AAA Server shall include the Home Agent
addresses in the APN-Configuration AVP in the response and the MIP6-Feature-
Vector AVP with the MIP6-INTEGRATED flag set. If the HA assignment via DHCPv6
is not used, the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP with the MIP6-INTEGRATED flag not set
shall be sent.
\- The PMIP6_SUPPORTED and/or GTPv2 SUPPORTED flag indicates to the 3GPP AAA
Server whether the trusted non-3GPP access network supports NBM or not.\ \ As
specified in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3], based on the information it has regarding the
UE (see 3GPP TS 24.302 [26]), local/home network capabilities and local/home
network policies, the 3GPP AAA Server may perform mobility mode selection
between NBM and HBM.\ For a trusted WLAN access, if the user is successfully
authenticated and authorized for this access, the 3GPP AAA Server may either
only authorize the user to access to EPC via S2a (i.e. EPC-routed service
only), or only authorize the user to access the TWAN without granting access
to EPC via S2a (i.e. non-seamless WLAN offload service only), or authorize
both EPC-routed and non-seamless WLAN offload services, taking also into
account the subscriber profile, access network, the selected WLAN identifier
if present, and the TWAN\'s non-seamless WLAN offload capability if present.
The 3GPP AAA Server may authorize both EPC-routed and non-seamless WLAN
offload services only in non-roaming scenarios; the 3GPP AAA Server shall not
authorize both EPC-routed and non-seamless WLAN offload services in roaming
scenarios.\ \ If the 3GPP AAA Server decides that access to EPC is authorized
and NBM should be used for such access, the PMIP6_SUPPORTED and
GTPv2_SUPPORTED flags shall be set in the response to indicate that NBM is
authorized for use for the UE by the trusted non 3GPP access network. If only
the PMIPv6_SUPPORTED or the GTPv2_SUPPORTED flag is present in the response,
the trusted non-3GPP access network shall assume that this also indicates that
NBM is authorized for use. In addition, for a trusted WLAN access, the Non-
seamlesss WLAN offload Authorization flag shall be set in the DEA-Flags AVP in
the response if the non-seamless WLAN offload is authorized.\ \ If the 3GPP
AAA Server decides to only authorize the user to access the TWAN without
granting access to EPC S2a (i.e. non-seamless WLAN offload service only), none
of the flags (PMIP6_SUPPORTED, GTPv2_SUPPORTED, MIP4_SUPPORTED,
MIP6-INTEGRATED, ASSIGN_LOCAL_IP) shall be set in the response, i.e. the
Mobility Capabilities IE is not sent in the response, and the Non-seamlesss
WLAN offload Authorization flag shall be set in the DEA-Flags AVP in the
response.
If the 3GPP AAA Server decides that a local IP address should be assigned for
HBM, the ASSIGN_LOCAL_IP flag shall be set in the response to indicate to the
trusted non 3GPP access network that a local IP address (for HBM) should be
assigned.\ \ The 3GPP AAA Server shall not set the
PMIP6_SUPPORTED/GTPv2_SUPPORTED and ASSIGN_LOCAL_IP flags both at the same
time in the response.
\- The MIP4_SUPPORTED flag indicates to the 3GPP AAA Server whether the
trusted non-3GPP access network supports MIPv4 FA-CoA mode or not. As
specified in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3], based on the information it has regarding the
UE (see 3GPP TS 24.302 [26]), local/home network capabilities and local/home
network policies, the 3GPP AAA Server may perform mobility mode selection. If
the 3GPP AAA Server decides that MIPv4 FA-CoA mode should be used, the
MIP4_SUPPORTED flag shall be set in the response.
NOTE 3: When selecting DSMIPv6 the AAA server assumes that the trusted non
3GPP access gateway has the capability to assign a local IP address to the UE.
Once the Authentication and Authorization procedure successfully finishes, the
3GPP AAA Server shall download, together with authentication data, the list of
authorized APN's and the authorized mobility protocols in the authentication
and authorization response from the HSS (see SWx procedure in Section
8.1.2.1). If the Access Network Identity received in the Authentication and
Authorization Request indicates WLAN (see subclause 8.1.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.302
[26]), the 3GPP AAA Server shall set the Default APN in the Authentication and
Authorization Answer to the Default APN for Trusted WLAN if received from the
HSS, otherwise to the subscriber\'s Default APN for 3GPP and other non-3GPP
accesses.
Once the Authentication and Authorization procedures successfully finish and
if MIPv4 FACoA mode is used the 3GPP AAA Server shall calculate the MIPv4
FACoA mobility security parameters as defined in 3GPP TS 33.402 [19] and
include these in the authentication and authorization response to the trusted
non 3GPP access network.
Exceptions to the cases specified here shall be treated by 3GPP AAA Server as
error situations, the Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY
and, therefore, no authorization information shall be returned.
##### 5.1.2.1.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy is required to handle roaming cases in which the non-3GPP
access network is connected to a VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a
stateful proxy, with the following additions.
On receipt of an authentication and authorization request, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
\- shall check the Visited-Network-Identifier AVP,
\- If the AVP is not present, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall insert it before
forwarding the request to the 3GPP AAA Server.
\- If the AVP is present, the 3GPP AAA Proxy may check and overwrite its
value, depending on its local policy, e.g. the trusted non-3GPP access network
being operated by the VPLMN operator or by a third party.
\- shall check the ANID AVP. If the result of the checking shows that the
included ANID value is not valid (not defined by 3GPP) or that the requesting
entity is not entitled to use the received value, the Result-Code shall be set
to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY and the authentication response shall be sent to
the trusted non-3GPP access network.
\- may take a decision about the trustworthiness of the non-3GPP access from
VPLMN\'s point of view. If such decision is taken, it shall be based on the
Access Network Identifier and optionally, on further information about the
non-3GPP access network, according to the 3GPP AAA Proxy\'s local policies.
These local policies shall reflect the security criteria described in 3GPP TS
33.402 [19], with the assumption that the PDN GW will be allocated in the
VPLMN.
NOTE: For example, if hop-by-hop security relationship exists between the NAS
and the 3GPP AAA Proxy, the 3GPP AAA Proxy may use the Origin-Host AVP to
uniquely identify the NAS and the access network.
The decision about the trustworthiness of the non-3GPP access network is
encoded to the VPLMN trust relationship indicator that is inserted to the
authentication and authorization request.
On receipt of the first authentication and authorization request, the 3GPP AAA
Proxy shall check locally configured information whether users from the HPLMN
are allowed to activate a PDN connection from the non-3GPP access network via
this (V)PLMN. If not, the Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_ERROR_ROAMING_NOT_ALLOWED and the authentication and authorization
response shall be sent to the non-3GPP access network.
On receipt of the authentication and authorization answer that completes a
successful authentication, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
\- may check locally configured information about using the chained S8-S2a
option towards the given HPLMN. If chaining is required, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
shall select a Serving GW from its network configuration database and shall
include the Serving GW address in the answer.
\- shall check locally configured information for the maximum allowed static
QoS parameters valid for visitors from the given HPLMN and modify the QoS
parameters received from the 3GPP AAA Server, to enforce the policy
limitations.
\- shall record the state of the connection (i.e. Authentication and
Authorization Successful).
##### 5.1.2.1.4 Trusted non-3GPP access network Detailed Behaviour
The Trusted non-3GPP access network shall initiate the Trusted non-3GPP Access
Authentication and Authorization procedure when the user attaches to the
access network. During the authentication, it shall act as a pass-through EAP
authenticator.
If PMIPv6, GTPv2 or MIPv4 FACoA is used, at successful completion of the
procedure, the trusted non-3GPP access network shall store the non-3GPP user
data received from the 3GPP AAA Server. The trusted non-3GPP access network
shall utilize these data
\- To authorize the APNs received in PDN connection creation request from the
UE;
\- To authorize the requested home address types: IPv4 home address and/or
IPv6 home network prefix.
NOTE: The user will be allowed to create PDN connections only to the
subscribed APNs and use the address types that are allowed by the subscribed
PDN types.
If DSMIPv6 is used and if the trusted non-3GPP access network has received the
PGW identity in form of the FQDN from the 3GPP AAA Server, then the trusted
non-3GPP access network may obtain the IP address of the Home Agent
functionality of that PGW as described in 3GPP TS 29.303 [34].
If MIPv4 FACoA is used and if the non-3GPP access network has received FA-RK-
SPI and FA-RK from the 3GPP AAA Server , the trusted non-3GPPaccess network
will use FA-RK key and FA-RK-SPI to further derive MN-FA shared key and MN-FA-
SPI, as defined in 3GPP TS 33.402 [19]. These are used to process the MN-FA
Authentication Extension in the RRQ/RRP messages if the extension is present.
If the subscriber is not roaming and the SIPTO-Permission information for an
APN is present, the HSGW shall allow SIPTO for that APN only if the SIPTO-
Permission information indicates so. If the subscriber is not roaming and the
SIPTO-Permission information for an APN is not present, the HSGW may allow
SIPTO for that APN. If the subscriber is roaming and the SIPTO-Permission
information for an APN is present, the HSGW shall allow SIPTO for that APN
only if the SIPTO-Permission information indicates so and the VPLMN Dynamic
Address is allowed and the HSGW selects a PDN GW in the VPLMN. For the
requested APN allowed for SIPTO, the trusted non-3GPP access network may use
the 3GPP DNS mechanism to select a PGW which is close to the HSGW. Detailed
behaviour is specified in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [25], 3GPP TS 23.402 [3] and 3GPP TS
29.303 [34].
For optimized handover of an emergency session from E-UTRAN to an S2a based
cdma2000^Â®^ HRPD access network, if the trusted non-3GPP access network
supports Emergency services for users in limited service state, then the
trusted non-3GPP access network shall skip the authentication procedure (for
users without an IMSI or with an IMSI marked as unauthenticated); or if the
trusted non-3GPP access network accepts that the authentication may fail (for
users with an IMSI), it shall continue with the procedure. For these cases,
the Trusted non-3GPP access network shall release any non-emergency PDN
connections.
The TWAN decides the S2a protocol variant to use if access to EPC is
authorized and the TWAN decides to establish S2a. The TWAN may be configured
with the S2a protocol variant(s) on a per PLMN granularity, or may retrieve
information regarding the S2a protocol variants supported by the PDN GW
(PMIPv6 or/and GTPv2) from the Domain Name Service Function as described in
3GPP TS 29.303[34]. For static PDN Gateway assignment, in order to determine
the PLMN of the PDN GW, the TWAN may use the Visited Network Identifier, if
received from the 3GPP AAA Server, or the FQDN of the PDN GW, if included in
the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP of the APN in use; if none of them are available, it
may use the PLMN where the 3GPP AAA Server is located.
If GTPv2 is used on S2a and if the Trace-Info AVP including Trace-Data has
been received in the authorization response, the trusted non-3GPP access
network shall send a GTPv2 Trace Session Activation message (see 3GPP TS
29.274 [38]) to the PGW to start a trace session for the user.
If the Trusted non-3GPP access networkdetermines that a previously assigned
3GPP AAA Sever is unavailable, it may attempt to send a new authentication and
authorization request to an alternate 3GPP AAA Server. If the Trusted non-3GPP
access network receives from this new server a redirect indication towards the
former server (due to the HSS having stored the former 3GPP AAA Server
identity), it shall terminate all previously existing sessions and PDN
connections for that user, and it shall re-send again the request towards the
new server, but it shall include the AAA-Failure-Indication AVP in the new
request.
#### 5.1.2.2 HSS/AAA Initiated Detach on STa
##### 5.1.2.2.1 General
This procedure is used between the 3GPP AAA/HSS and the trusted non-3GPP
access network to instruct the non-3GPP access network to detach a specific
user from the access network. The procedure is based on Diameter session abort
messages.
Diameter usage over the STa interface:
\- This procedure is mapped to the Diameter command codes Diameter-Abort-
Session-Request (ASR), Diameterâ€‘Abort-Session-Answer (ASA), Diameter-Session-
Termination-Request (STR) and Diameter-Session-Termination-Answer (STA)
specified in RFC 3588 [7]. Information element contents for these messages are
shown in tables 5.1.2.2.1/1 and 5.1.2.2.1/2.
\- The STa application id value of 16777250 shall be used as the Application
Id in ASR/ASA/STR/STA commands.
Table 5.1.2.2.1/1: Information Elements passed in ASR message
* * *
Information element name Mapping to Diameter AVP Cat. Description Permanent
User Identity User-Name M This information element shall contain the permanent
identity of the user. The identity shall be represented in NAI form as
specified in IETF RFC 4282 [15], and shall be formatted as defined in clause
19 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [14]; this IE shall not include the leading digit
prepended in front of the IMSI used to differentiate between authentication
schemes. Auth-Session-State Auth-Session-State O If present this information
element shall indicate to the Non-3GPP access network whether the 3GPP AAA
Server requires an STR message.

##### 5.1.2.2.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Server shall make use of this procedure to instruct the Non-3GPP
access network to detach a specific user from the access network.
In the DSMIPv6 case, the 3GPP AAA Server shall initiate first the detach
procedure over the S6b reference point towards the PDN GW. When this process
has finalized, the 3GPP AAA Server can initiate the detach procedure of the UE
from the non-3GPP access network.
The 3GPP AAA Server shall include the Auth-Session-State AVP in the ASR
command with a value of NO_STATE_MAINTAINED if it does not require a STR from
the Non-3GPP access network. If it does require a STR from the Non-3GPP access
network, the 3GPP AAA Server shall either omit the Auth-Session-State AVP from
the ASR command or include the Auth-Session-State AVP in the ASR command with
a value of STATE_MAINTAINED.
On receipt of the ASR command, the Non-3GPP access network shall check if the
user is known in the Non-3GPP access network. If not, Experimental-Result-Code
shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN.
If the user is known, the Non-3GPP access network shall perform the
disconnection of all the PDN connections active for this user and remove any
stored user information, except for emergency PDN connections which shall
remain active, if the trusted Non-3GPP access supports Emergency services for
users in limited service state.
The Non-3GPP access network shall set the Result-Code to DIAMETER_SUCCESS and
send back the ASA command to the 3GPP AAA Server, which shall update the
status of the subscriber on the detached access network.
If required by the 3GPP AAA Server, the Non-3GPP access network shall send an
STR with the Termination-Cause set to DIAMETER_ADMINISTRATIVE. The 3GPP AAA
Server shall set the Result-Code to DIAMETER_SUCCESS and return the STA
command to the Non-3GPP access network.
##### 5.1.2.2.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
When the 3GPP AAA Proxy receives the ASR from the 3GPP AAA Server it shall
route the request to the non-3GPP access network.
If the 3GPP AAA Proxy requires an STR but the 3GPP AAA Server does not, the
3GPP AAA Proxy may override the value of the Auth-Session-State AVP in the ASR
and set it to STATE_MAINTAINED. In this case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall not
forward the STR received from the non-3GPP access network onto the 3GPP AAA
Server and shall return an STA command to the non-3GPP access network with the
Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall not override the
value of the Auth-Session-State AVP under any other circumstances.
On receipt of the ASA message with Diameter Result Code set to
DIAMETER_SUCCESS, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall route the successful response to
the 3GPP AAA Server and shall release the resources associated with the
session.
When the 3GPP AAA Proxy receives the STR from the Non-3GPP access network, it
shall route the request to the 3GPP AAA Server. On receipt of the STA message,
the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall route the response to the Non-3GPP access network.
#### 5.1.2.3 STa Re-Authorization and Re-Authentication Procedures
##### 5.1.2.3.1 General
The STa Re-Authorization procedure shall be used between the 3GPP AAA Server
and the trusted non-3GPP access network for enabling:
\- the 3GPP AAA Server to modify the previously provided authorization
parameters. This may happen due to a modification of the subscriber profile in
the HSS (for example, removal of a specific APN associated with the
subscriber, or change of the identity of a dynamically allocated PDN GW, see
subclause 8.1.2.3). In this case, this procedure is performed in two steps:
\- The 3GPP AAA server shall issue an STa Re-Auth request towards the trusted
non-3GPP access network. Upon receipt of such a request, the trusted non-3GPP
access network shall respond to the request and shall indicate the disposition
of the request. This procedure is mapped to the Diameter command Re-Auth-
Request and Re-Auth-Answer specified in IETF RFC 3588 [7]. Information element
contents for these messages are shown in tables 5.1.2.3.1/1 and 5.1.2.3.1/2.
\- Upon receiving the STa Re-Auth request, the non-3GPP access network shall
immediately invoke the STa access authorization procedure, based on the reuse
of the Diameter command codes AA-Request and AA-Answer commands specified in
IETF RFC 4005 [4]. Information element contents for these messages are shown
in tables 5.1.2.3.1/3 and 5.1.2.3.1/4.
\- the trusted non-3GPP access network to retrieve the subscriber profile from
the HSS. This procedure may be initiated at any time by the Trusted non-3GPP
access network for check if there is any modification in the user
authorization parameters previously provided by the 3GPP AAA Server. In this
one-step procedure, the trusted non-3GPP access network shall invoke the STa
access authorization procedure, based on the reuse of the Diameter commands
AA-Request and AA-Answer commands IETF RFC 4005 [4]. Information element
contents for these messages are shown in tables 5.1.2.3.1/3 and 5.1.2.3.1/4.
After receiving the authorization answer, the trusted non-3GPP access network
will release the active PDN connections, for which the authorization has been
revoked. If the authorization was rejected by the 3GPP AAA server (e.g.
because the user\'s subscription for non-3GPP accesses has been terminated),
the non-3GPP access network shall detach the user from the non-3GPP access
network and release all resources. If an emergency PDN connection is active
and the trusted non-3GPP access supports emergency services for users in
limited service state, the non-3GPP access network shall keep the user
attached in the non-3GPP access and the emergency PDN connection active. The
non-emergency resources shall be released.
The STa Re-Authentication procedure shall be used between the 3GPP AAA Server
and the trusted non-3GPP access network for re-authenticating the user. This
procedure may be initiated at any time by the 3GPP AAA Server based on HPLMN
operator policies configured in the 3GPP AAA server. This procedure is
performed in two steps:
\- The 3GPP AAA server issues an STa Re-Auth request towards the trusted
non-3GPP access. Upon receipt of such a request, the trusted non-3GPP access
network shall respond to the request and indicate the disposition of the
request. This procedure is mapped to the Diameter command Re-Auth-Request and
Re-Auth-Answer specified in IETF RFC 3588 [7]. Information element contents
for these messages are shown in tables 5.1.2.3.1/1 and 5.1.2.3.1/2.
\- Upon receiving the STa Re-Auth request, the trusted non-3GPP access network
shall immediately invoke the STa Access Authentication and Authorization
procedure, based on the Re-Auth Request Type provided by the 3GPP AAA server.
This procedure is mapped to the Diameter command codes based on the reuse of
the Diameter commands Diameter-EAP-Request and Diameter-EAP-Answer specified
in IETF RFC 4072 [5]. Information element contents for these messages are
shown in tables 5.1.2.3.1/5 and 5.1.2.3.1/6.
If the re-authentication of the user is not successful, the trusted non-3GPP
access network will release all the active PDN connections of the user, except
for emergency PDN connections which shall remain active if the trusted
non-3GPP access network supports Emergency services for users in limited
service state. After a successful authentication and authorization procedure,
the trusted non-3GPP access network shall release the active PDN connections
for which the authorization has been revoked.

##### 5.1.2.3.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
Handling of Re-Auth Request:
The 3GPP AAA Server shall make use of this procedure to indicate the
following:
  * If the relevant service authorization information shall be updated in the Trusted non-3GPP access network, the Reâ€‘Authâ€‘Requestâ€‘Type shall be set to AUTHORIZE_ONLY. This procedure may be triggered by the HSS sending a subscription data update (refer to clause 8.1.2.3) or by local policies, e.g. periodic re-authorization configured by the operator. As for the STa reference point, only a single Diameter authorization session is used for a user, this procedure is initiated for all the PDN connections of this user, i.e. a single instance of Re-authorization Request shall be used per user.
  * If the re-authentication and re-authorization of the user shall be executed, the Reâ€‘Authâ€‘Requestâ€‘Type shall be set to AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE. This procedure may be triggered e.g. by the expiration of a timer started at the successful completion of the last (re-)authentication of the user, depending on the local policies configured in the 3GPP AAA Server.
Handling of Authorization Request:
The 3GPP AAA Server shall check that the user exists in the 3GPP AAA Server.
The check shall be based on Diameter Session-Id. If not, Experimental-Result-
Code shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN. If the user exists, the 3GPP
AAA Server shall perform the authorization checking described in chapter
5.1.2.1.2.
If the Authorization request contained the MIP6-Feature-Vector with the
OPTIMIZED_IDLE_MODE_MOBILITY flag set, the 3GPP AAA server shall request the
user data from the HSS, in order to retrieve up-to-date PDN GW information.
Handling of Authentication and Authorization Requests:
The 3GPP AAA Server shall execute the re-authentication of the user, using a
full authentication or fast re-authentication, as described in 3GPP TS 33.402
[19], clause 6.2 and 6.3. If full authentication is executed and there are no
valid authentication vectors for the given non-3GPP access network available
in the 3GPP AAA Server, it shall fetch authentication vectors from the HSS. A
combined authentication and authorization shall be executed, with reduced
message content described in Tables 5.1.2.3.1/5 and 5.1.2.3.1/6. The QoS-
Capability, Access Network Identity, Access Type, Visited Network Identifier,
Terminal Information elements received during the initial authentication and
authorization procedure as well as the trustworthiness of the non-3GPP AN and
the IP mobility mode selected during that procedure shall be considered as
valid. If re-authentication of the user is successful and MIPv4 FACoA mode is
used the 3GPP AAA Server shall create the MIPv4 FACoA security parameters as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.402 [19].
If the re-authentication of the user is unsuccessful, the 3GPP AAA Server
shall:
\- Terminate all S6b authorization sessions connected to the user, as
described in clause 9.1.2.4
\- Remove all APN-PDN GW bindings from the HSS, as described in subclauses
8.1.2.2.2.1 and 8.1.2.2.2.2.
\- De-register the user from the HSS, as described in subclauses 8.1.2.2.2.1
and 8.1.2.2.2.2. Depending on the cause of the re-authentication being
unsuccessful, the Server Assignment Type shall be set to
AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE or AUTHENTICATION_TIMEOUT.
\- Release all resources connected to the user.
##### 5.1.2.3.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy is required to handle roaming cases in which the Non-3GPP
access network is in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a stateful
proxy, with the following additions.
When forwarding the authorization answer or the authentication and
authorization answer, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
\- shall check locally configured information for the maximum allowed static
QoS parameters valid for visitors from the given HPLMN and modify the QoS
parameters received from the 3GPP AAA Server, to enforce the policy
limitations.
\- shall record the state of the connection (i.e. Authentication and
Authorization Successful).
##### 5.1.2.3.4 Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network Detailed Behaviour
Upon receiving the re-auth request, the Trusted non-3GPP access network shall
perform the following checks and if an error is detected, the non-3GPP access
network shall stop processing the request and return the corresponding error
code.
Check the Re-Auth--Request-Type AVP:
1) If it indicates AUTHENTICATE_ONLY, Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_INVALID_AVP_VALUE.
2) If it indicates AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE, the authentication and
authorization of the user is initiated, as defined in 3GPP TS 33.402, with the
Diameter message contents described by Tables 5.1.2.3.1/5 and 5.1.2.3.1/6.
3) If it indicates AUTHORIZE_ONLY, the non-3GPP access network shall just
perform an authorization procedure as described by Tables 5.1.2.3.1/3 and
5.1.2.3.1/4.
After successful authorization or authentication and authorization procedure,
the trusted non-3GPP access network shall overwrite, for the subscriber
identity indicated in the request and the received session, the current
authorization information with the information received from the 3GPP AAA
Server.
For the TWAN access, if the TWAN receives the PDN GW Identity from 3GPP AAA
Server which is different from the currently selected PDN GW for the same APN,
the TWAN shall not tear down the existing PDN connection.
The release of a PDN connection shall be initiated if the user\'s subscription
for the APN belonging to an active PDN connection has been terminated.
If the authorization or authentication and authorization procedure was
unsuccessful, the non-3GPP access network shall detach the user from the
non-3GPP access and release all resources. If the trusted non-3GPP access
supports emergency services for users in limited service state, and there is
an emergency PDN connection active for such user, the non-3GPP access network
shall keep the user attached in the non-3GPP access and the emergency PDN
connection active. The non-emergency resources shall be released.
The Trusted Non-3GPP access network shall initiate the re-authorization of the
user in a one-step procedure (i.e. without receiving a re-authorization
request from the AAA Server) if the PDN GW information needs to be updated for
optimized idle mode mobility from E-UTRAN to HRPD access.
If GTPv2 is used on S2a and if the Trace-Info AVP including Trace-Data has
been received in the authorization response, the trusted non-3GPP access
network shall send a GTPv2 Trace Session Activation message (see 3GPP TS
29.274 [38]) to the PGW to start a trace session for the user. If the Trace-
Info AVP including Trace-Reference (directly under the Trace-Info) has been
received in the authorization response, the trusted non-3GPP access network
shall send a GTPv2 Trace Session Deactivation message to the PGW to stop the
ongoing trace session, identified by the Trace-Reference. For details, see
3GPP TS 32.422 [32].
#### 5.1.2.4 Non-3GPP Access Network Initiated Session Termination
##### 5.1.2.4.1 General
The STa reference point allows the non-3GPP access network to inform the 3GPP
AAA server that the session resources of the non-3GPP access network assigned
to a given user are being released.
The procedure shall be initiated by the non-3GPP access network and removes
non-3GPP access information from the 3GPP AAA Server. These procedures are
based on the reuse of Diameter Base IETF RFC 3588[7] STR and STA commands
Table 5.1.2.4.1/1: STa Session Termination Request

##### 5.1.2.4.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
Upon reception of the Session Termination Request message from the non-3GPP
access network, the 3GPP AAA Server shall check that there is an ongoing
session associated to the two parameters received (Session-Id and User-Name).
If an active session is found and it belongs to the user identified by the
User-Name parameter, the 3GPP AAA Server shall deregister itself as the
managing 3GPP AAA Server for the subscriber following the procedures listed in
8.1.2.2.2. In case of a deregistration success, the 3GPP AAA Server shall
release the session resources associated to the specified session and a
Session Termination Response shall be sent to the non-3GPP access network,
indicating DIAMETER_SUCCESS. If deregistration from the HSS fails, the 3GPP
AAA Server shall return a Session-Termination Response with the Diameter Error
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
Otherwise, the 3GPP AAA Server returns a Session Termination Response with the
Diameter Error DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID
##### 5.1.2.4.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy is required to handle roaming cases in which the non-3GPP
access network is located in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a
stateful proxy.
On receipt of the Session Termination Request message from the non-3GPP access
network, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall route the message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
On receipt of the Session Termination Answer message from the 3GPP AAA Server,
the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall route the message to the non-3GPP access network and
it shall release any local resources associated to the specified session only
if the result code is set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
## 5.2 Protocol Specification
### 5.2.1 General
The STa reference point shall be based on Diameter, as defined in IETF RFC
3588 [7] and contain the following additions and extensions:
\- IETF RFC 4005 [4], which defines a Diameter protocol application used for
Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) services in the Network
Access Server (NAS) environment.
\- IETF RFC 4072 [5], which provides a Diameter application to support the
transport of EAP (IETF RFC 3748 [8]) frames over Diameter.
\- IETF RFC 5779 [2], which defines a Diameter extensions and application for
PMIPv6 MAG to AAA and LMA to AAA interfaces.
\- IETF RFC 5447 [6], which defines Diameter extensions for Mobile IPv6 NAS to
AAA interface.
In the case of a trusted non-3GPP IP access where PMIPv6 is used as mobility
protocol, the MAG to 3GPP AAA server or the MAG to 3GPP AAA proxy
communication shall use the MAG to AAA interface functionality defined in IETF
RFC 5779 [2] and the NAS to AAA interface functionality defined in IETF RFC
5447 [6].
The trusted non-3GPP access network to AAA interface functionality over the
STa reference defines a new Application Id:
\- \"STa\" with value 16777250.
The STa application reuses existing EAP (IETF RFC 4072 [5]) application
commands, command ABNFs, and application logic and procedures.

* * *
Only those AVP initially defined in this reference point or AVP with values
initially defined in this reference point and for this procedure are described
in the following subchapters.
#### 5.2.3.2 Mobile-Node-Identifier
The Mobile-Node-Identifier AVP (AVP Code 506) is of type UTF8String.
The Mobile-Node-Identifier AVP is returned in an answer message that ends a
successful authentication (and possibly an authorization) exchange between the
AAA client and the AAA server. The returned Mobile Node Identifier may be used
as the PMIPv6 MN-ID or as the MIPv4 MN-NAI or to derive the IMSI to be sent in
GTPv2 signalling.
The Mobile-Node-Identifier is defined on IETF RFC 5779 [2].
#### 5.2.3.3 MIP6-Feature-Vector
The MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP (AVP Code 124) is of type Unsigned64 and contains
a 64 bit flags field of supported mobile IP capabilities of the non-3GPP
access network (when this AVP is used in the request commands) and the mobile
IP capabilities the 3GPP AAA Server has authorized (when this AVP is used in
the response commands).
The following capabilities are defined for STa interface:
\- MIP6_INTEGRATED (0x0000000000000001)\ This flag is set by the non-3GPP
access network and the 3GPP AAA Server. It means that the Mobile IPv6
integrated scenario bootstrapping functionality is supported.
\- PMIP6_SUPPORTED (0x0000010000000000)\ When this flag is set by the non-3GPP
access network it indicates to the 3GPP AAA Server that it supports PMIPv6.\
When this flag is set by the 3GPP AAA Server it indicates to the non-3GPP
access network that NBM shall be used.
\- ASSIGN_LOCAL_IP (0x0000080000000000)\ This flag is set by the 3GPP AAA
Server.\ When this flag is set by the 3GPP AAA Server it indicates to the
non-3GPP access network that the non-3GPP access network shall assign to the
user a local IP address (for HBM).
\- MIP4_SUPPORTED (0x0000100000000000)\ This flag is set by the non-3GPP
access network, the PDN GW and the 3GPP AAA Server. When this flag is set by
the non-3GPP access network it indicates to the 3GPP AAA Server that it
supports MIPv4 FA-CoA mode. When this flag is set by the 3GPP AAA Server it
indicates to the non-3GPP access network that MIPv4 FA-CoA mode shall be used.
When this flag is set by the PDN GW and 3GPP AAA Server over the S6b
interface, it shows that MIPv4 mobility protocol is used on the S2a interface.
\- OPTIMIZED_IDLE_MODE_MOBILITY (0x0000200000000000)\ This flag is set by the
Trusted Non-3GPP access network if the PDN GW information needs to be updated
for the case of idle mode mobility from E-UTRAN to HRPD access.
\- GTPv2_SUPPORTED (0x0000400000000000)\ When this flag is set by the non-3GPP
access network it indicates to the 3GPP AAA Server that it supports GTPv2.\
When this flag is set by the 3GPP AAA Server it indicates to the non-3GPP
access network that NBM shall be used.
#### 5.2.3.4 QoS Capability
This AVP is FFS
#### 5.2.3.5 Service-Selection
The Service-Selection AVP is of type of UTF8String. This AVP contains an APN
Network Identifier (i.e., an APN without the Operator Identifier), and it
shall consist of one or more labels according to DNS naming conventions (IETF
RFC 1035 [35]) describing the access point to the packet data network.
The contents of the Service-Selection AVP shall be formatted as a character
string composed of one or more labels separated by dots (\".\").
The Service-Selection AVP is defined in IETF RFC 5778 [11].
#### 5.2.3.6 RAT-Type
The RAT-Type AVP (AVP code 1032) is of type Enumerated and is used to identify
the radio access technology that is serving the UE. It follows the
specification described in TS 29.212 [23].
#### 5.2.3.7 ANID
The ANID AVP is of type UTF8String; this AVP contains the Access Network
Identity; see 3GPP TS 24.302 [26] for defined values.
#### 5.2.3.8 AMBR
Please refer to 3GPP TS 29.272 [29] for the encoding of this AVP.
#### 5.2.3.9 AN-Trusted
The AN-Trusted AVP (AVP Code 1503) is of type Enumerated.
The AN-Trusted AVP sent from the 3GPP AAA Server to the Non-3GPP access
network conveys the decision about the access network being trusted or
untrusted by the HPLMN.
The following values are defined:
TRUSTED (0)
This value is used when the non-3GPP access network is to be handled as
trusted.
> UNTRUSTED (1)
This value is used when the non-3GPP access network is to be handled as
untrusted.
#### 5.2.3.10 Feature-List-ID AVP
The syntax of this AVP is defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [24]. For this release,
the Feature-List-ID AVP value shall be set to 1 for the STa/SWa application.
#### 5.2.3.11 Feature-List AVP
The syntax of this AVP is defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [24]. A null value

### 6.1.2 Procedures Description
#### 6.1.2.1 Trusted non-3GPP Access / Access Gateway related procedures
##### 6.1.2.1.1 Trusted Non-3GPP Access Authentication and Authorization
When used in connection with the STa interface, the SWd interface shall
support the trusted non-3GPP access authentication and authorization procedure
defined in clause 5.1.2.1. For this procedure, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall
forward the Diameter commands received from the 3GPP AAA Server and the
trusted non-3GPP access network as a stateful Diameter proxy, with the
following exceptions:
  * The 3GPP AAA Proxy may reject an authentication and authorization request, if roaming is not allowed for the users of the given HPLMN.
  * When forwarding an authentication and authorization request, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall check the presence and value of the visited network identifier. If the AVP was missing, it shall insert it, if the AVP was present, it may overwrite the AVP value before forwarding the request.
  * The 3GPP AAA Proxy may modify the service authorization information in the authentication and authorization answer that it forwards to the trusted non-3GPP access network, in order to enforce the QoS limitations according to the local policies and the roaming agreement with the home operator.
  * The 3GPP AAA Proxy may decide about the trustworthiness of the non-3GPP access from the VPLMN point of view and insert a trust relationship indicator to the authentication and authorization request.
The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall decide about using the S2a-PMIP based S8 chaining and
in case it has selected that option, it shall select the Serving GW to be
invoked and it shall add the Serving GW address to the authentication and
authorization answer that is sent upon successful completion of the
authentication.
Table 6.1.2.1.1/1 describes the trusted non-3GPP access authentication and
authorization request forwarded on the SWd interface.

## 6.2 Protocol Specification
### 6.2.1 General
The SWd reference point shall be based on Diameter, as defined in IETF RFC
3588 [7] and contain the following additions and extensions:
\- IETF RFC 4005 [4], which defines a Diameter protocol application used for
Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) services in the Network
Access Server (NAS) environment.
\- IETF RFC 4072 [5], which provides a Diameter application to support the
transport of EAP (IETF RFC 3748 [8]) frames over Diameter.
\- IETF RFC 5779 [2], which defines Diameter extensions and application for
PMIPv6 MAG to AAA and LMA to AAA interfaces.
\- IETF RFC 5447 [6], which defines Diameter extensions for Mobile IPv6 NAS to
AAA interface.
There is no separate application ID defined for the SWd interface. The
application ID used by the 3GPP AAA Proxy depends on the command sent over
SWd.
NOTE: Even though the 3GPP AAA Proxy may add new AVPs to the Diameter commands
forwarded to/from the 3GPP AAA Server, there is no AVP present in the SWd
reference point that would not be present in the interface that is used in
connection with it. Therefore, the same Application ID can be used.

Only those AVP initially defined in this reference point and for this
procedure are described in the following subchapters.
# 7 SWm Description
## 7.1 Functionality
### 7.1.1 General
The SWm reference point is defined between the ePDG and the 3GPP AAA Server or
between the ePDG and the 3GPP AAA Proxy. The definition of the reference point
and its functionality is given in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3].
The SWm reference point shall be used to authenticate and authorize the UE.
The SWm reference point is also used to transport NBM related mobility
parameters in a case the UE attaches to the EPC via the S2b (based on PMIPv6
or GTPv2) and SWn reference points (i.e. IP Mobility Mode Selection
information).
Additionally the SWm reference point may also be used to transport DSMIPv6
related mobility parameters in case the UE attaches to the EPC using the S2c
reference point. In particular, in this case the SWm reference point may be
used for conveying the Home Agent IP address or FQDN from the AAA server to
the ePDG for Home Agent discovery based on IKEv2 (see TS 24.303 [13]).
### 7.1.2 Procedures Description
#### 7.1.2.1 Authentication and Authorization Procedures
##### 7.1.2.1.1 General
The authentication and authorization procedure shall be used between the ePDG
and 3GPP AAA Server/Proxy. When a PDN connection is activated by the UE an
IKEv2 exchange shall be initiated. It shall be invoked by the ePDG, on receipt
from the UE of a \"tunnel establishment request\" message. This shall take the
form of forwarding an IKEv2 exchange with the purpose of authenticating in
order to set up an IKE Security Association (SA) between the UE and the ePDG.
During the Access Authentication and Authorization procedure the ePDG may
provide information on its PMIPv6 or GTPv2 capabilities to the 3GPP AAA
Server. The 3GPP AAA Server may perform IP mobility mode selection between NBM
or HBM as specified in subclause 4.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [3]. The 3GPP AAA
Server may provide to the ePDG an indication if either NBM or local IP address
assignment shall be used. If NBM shall be used, the ePDG then decides the S2b
protocol variant to use.
Upon a successful authorization, when NBM is used, the 3GPP AAA server shall
return NBM related information back to the ePDG. This information may include
the assigned PDN GW, UE IPv6 HNP and/or UE IPv4-HoA.
Upon a successful authorization, when DSMIPv6 is used, to enable HA address
discovery based on IKEv2 (see TS 24.303 [13]), the 3GPP AAA server may also
download PDN GW identity to the ePDG.
The PDN Gateway identity is a FQDN and/or IP address of the PDN GW. If a FQDN
is provided, the ePDG shall derive it to IP address according to the selected
mobility management protocol.
If DSMIPv6 is used, a single IKE SA is used for all PDN connections of the
user. If PMIPv6 or GTPv2 is used, a separate IKE SA is created for each PDN
connection of the user (refer to 3GPP TS 24.302 [26]).
Each new additional IKE SA shall be handled in a different Diameter session.
In such cases, the IP mobility mode selected during the first authentication
and authorization procedure is valid for all PDN connections of the user,
therefore, dynamic IP mobility mode selection is not executed during the
further procedures. The ePDG may select the same or different S2b protocol
variant(s) towards different PDN GWs when NBM has been selected.
The SWm reference point shall perform authentication and authorization based
on the reuse of the DER/DEA command set defined in Diameter EAP application,
IETF RFC 4072 [5].

##### 7.1.2.1.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
On receipt of the DER message, the 3GPP AAA Server shall check that the user
data exists in the 3GPP AAA Server. If not, the 3GPP AAA Server shall use the
procedures defined for the SWx interface to obtain access authentication and
authorization data.
If the HSS returns DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKWNOWN, the 3GPP AAA Server shall
return the same error to the ePDG.
If the HSS indicates that the user is currently being served by a different
3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server shall respond to the ePDG with the
Result-Code set to DIAMETER_REDIRECT_INDICATION and Redirect-Host set to the
Diameter URI of the 3GPP AAA Server currently serving the user (this Diameter
URI shall be constructed based on the Diameter Identity included in the 3GPP-
AAA-Server-Name AVP returned in the SWx authentication response from the HSS).
Otherwise, the 3GPP AAA Server shall proceed with the authentication and
authorization procedure. The 3GPP AAA Server shall use the procedures defined
in SWx interface to obtain authorization data from HSS.
If the 3GPP AAA Server receives a request message not related to any existing
session and is able to recognize that the ePDG included the AAA-Failure-
Indication AVP in the request, the 3GPP AAA Server shall also include the AAA-
Failure-Indication AVP over the SWx interface, while retrieving the access
authentication and authorization data from the HSS.
If the user does not have non-3GPP access subscription, then 3GPP AAA Server
shall respond to the non-3GPP access network with Experimental-Result-Code
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_NO_NON_3GPP_SUBSCRIPTION.
If a Visited- Network-Identifier is present in the request and if the user is
not allowed to roam in the visited network, then the 3GPP AAA Server shall
return Experimental-Result-Code set to DIAMETER_ERROR_ROAMING_NOT_ALLOWED.
Otherwise the 3GPP AAA Server shall run EAP-AKA as specified in 3GPP TS 33.402
[19]. Exceptions to the cases specified here shall be treated by 3GPP AAA
Server as error situations, the Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY and, therefore, no authentication information shall
be returned.
Upon receiving the authentication and authorization request from the ePDG, the
3GPP AAA Server marks the trust relationship as \"untrusted\" with the User
Identity. If the 3GPP AAA Server detects that an S6b session already exists
for this UE and the S6b session was established as a result of an
authentication request for DSMIPv6, the 3GPP AAA Server shall send the trust
relationship to the PDN GW as specified in clause 9.1.2.5.
Once authentication is successfully completed, the 3GPP AAA Server shall
perform the following authorization checking (if there is an error in any of
the steps, the 3GPP AAA Server shall stop processing and return the
corresponding error code):
1) Check if the user is barred to use the non 3GPP Access. If it is so, then
the Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED
2) Check whether the user is barred to use the subscribed APNs. If it is so,
Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED.
3) Check if there was request for an APN received. If not, AAA Server shall
check, whether the user already has an active PDN connection to the default
APN. If it is so, the Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
Otherwise, the default APN of the user is selected to be used during the
actual authentication and authorization procedure.
4) Check if user has a subscription for the requested APN or for the wildcard
APN. If not, Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_NO_APN_SUBSCRIPTION
5) If present, check the flags of the received MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP: The
evaluation of the flags is executed only in the first authentication and
authorization procedure for the user after an initial attach or handover, in
all the subsequent procedures, the AAA Server shall insert the same values.
\- If the MIP6-INTEGRATED flag is set and the 3GPP AAA server has authorized
IKEv2 Home Agent assignment, the 3GPP AAA server shall include the Home Agent
addresses in the APN-Configuration AVP in the response and the MIP6-Feature-
Vector AVP with the MIP6-INTEGRATED flag set. In this case, the 3GPP AAA Sever
may select the Home Agent based on the identity of the ePDG as included in the
Origin-Host AVP in the authentication and authorization request if no static
PDN GW address is received from the HSS. If the HA assignment via IKEv2 is not
used, the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP with the MIP6-INTEGRATED flag not set shall
be sent.
\- The PMIP6_SUPPORTED and/or GTPv2_SUPPORTED flag indicates to the 3GPP AAA
server whether the ePDG supports NBM or not. As specified in 3GPP TS 23.402
[3], based on the information it has regarding the UE (see 3GPP TS 24.302
[26]), local/home network capabilities and local/home network policies, the
3GPP AAA server may perform mobility mode selection. If the 3GPP AAA server
decides that NBM should be used, the PMIP6_SUPPORTED and GTPv2_SUPPORTED flags
shall be set in the response to indicate the NBM support of the UE to the
ePDG. If only the PMIP6_SUPPORTED or the GTPv2_SUPPORTED flag is present in
the response, the ePDG shall assume that this also indicates the NBM support
of the UE to the ePDG and the ePDG may select any S2b protocol variant (PMIPv6
or GTPv2). If the 3GPP AAA server decides that a local IP address should be
assigned, the ASSIGN_LOCAL_IP flag shall be set in the response to indicate to
the ePDG that a local IP address should be assigned.
NOTE: When selecting DSMIPv6, the AAA server assumes that the ePDG has the
capability to assign a local IP address to the UE.
\- The 3GPP AAA server shall not set the PMIP6_SUPPORTED/GTPv2_SUPPORTED and
ASSIGN_LOCAL_IP flags both at the same time in the response.
Upon successful authentication and authorization, the 3GPP AAA Server shall
return user data relevant to the APN as received from the HSS. The Result-Code
shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
Exceptions to the cases specified here shall be treated by 3GPP AAA Server as
error situations, the Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY
and, therefore, no authorization information shall be returned.
For Fixed Broadband access network interworking as specified in 3GPP TS 23.139
[39], the 3GPP AAA server shall determine if the UE is connected via a BBF-
defined WLAN access according to the UE local IP address in UE-Local-IP-
Address AVP from the ePDG. If the UE is connected via a BBF-defined WLAN
access, the 3GPP AAA server shall perform the enabling UE reflective QoS
function as specified in 3GPP TS 24.139 [43].
##### 7.1.2.1.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall be required to handle roaming cases in which the ePDG
is in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a stateful proxy with the
following additions.
On receipt of the first authentication and authorization request, the 3GPP AAA
Proxy shall check locally configured information whether users from the HPLMN
are allowed to activate a PDN connection from the non-3GPP access network via
this (V)PLMN. If not, the Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_ERROR_ROAMING_NOT_ALLOWED and the authentication response shall be
sent to the ePDG.
On receipt of the authentication and authorization answer that completes a
successful authentication, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
\- may check locally configured information about using the chained S8-S2b
option towards the given HPLMN. If chaining is required, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
shall select a Serving GW from its network configuration database and shall
include the Serving GW address in the response.
\- shall check locally configured information for the maximum allowed static
QoS parameters valid for visitors from the given HPLMN and modify the QoS
parameters received from the 3GPP AAA Server, to enforce the policy
limitations.
> \- shall record the state of the connection (i.e. Authorization Successful).
>
> \- may select the Home Agent based on the identity of the ePDG as included
> in the Origin-Host AVP in the authentication and authorization request if
> IKEv2 based Home Agent discovery is used and VPLMN Dynamic Address Allowed
> AVP is received. In this case, the 3GPP AAA proxy shall include the Home
> Agent addresses in the APN-Configuration AVP in the response and the
> MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP with the MIP6-INTEGRATED flag set if no static PDN
> GW address is received from the 3GPP AAA Server.
##### 7.1.2.1.4 ePDG Detailed Behaviour
The ePDG shall initiate a new authentication and authorization procedure for
each new IKE_SA. Each IKE_SA shall be handled in a different session.
The ePDG shall set flags signalling its capabilities to the same value in all
authentication and authorization procedure for the same user (include the same
MIP6-Feature-Vector). During the second and further authentication and
authorization procedures, the ePDG shall discard the flag values received from
the AAA Server and reuse the values received during the first procedure
executed for the user.
For PMIPv6/GTPv2 based S2b, when receiving a Serving GW address in an
authentication response, the ePDG shall check, whether it has already a
Serving GW address stored for the user.
\- If it has no Serving GW address available, it shall store the received
value and use it as LMA address when creating PMIP bindings.
\- If it has already a stored Serving GW address value, it shall ignore the
received SGW-Address AVP.
NOTE 1: In case of untrusted access, there is an authentication session
started for all PDN connection setup requests of a user. These sessions may
invoke different 3GPP AAA Proxies, which in turn may assign different Serving
GWs to the user. The ePDG behaviour ensures that in spite of this possibility,
the same Serving GW is used for all PDN connections of the user.
NOTE 2: The ePDG knows if NBM is used or if a local IP address is assigned
based on the flags in the MIP6-Feature-Vector or based on preconfigured
information. If the PMIP6_SUPPORTED and/or the GTPv2_SUPPORTED flag are set in
the MIP6-Feature-Vector received from the 3GPP AAA Server, the ePDG knows that
NBM is used.
For PMIPv6/GTPv2 based S2b, the ePDG shall utilize the downloaded APN
configuration data to authorize the UE requested home address types: IPv4 home
address and/or IPv6 home network prefix.
The ePDG may use the Visited_Network_Identifier to determine the S2b protocol
type (PMIPv6 or GTPv2). The ePDG may be configured with the S2b protocol
variant(s) on a per HPLMN granularity, or may retrieve information regarding
the S2b protocol variants supported by the PDN GW (PMIPv6 or/and GTPv2) from
the Domain Name Service Function as described in 3GPP TS 29.303[34].
If GTPv2 is used on S2b and if the Trace-Info AVP including Trace-Data has
been received in the authorization response, the ePDG shall send a GTPv2 Trace
Session Activation message (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [38]) to the PGW to start a
trace session for the user.
If DSMIPv6 is used and if ePDG has received the PGW identity in form of the
FQDN from the 3GPP AAA server, then the ePDG may obtain the IP address of the
Home Agent functionality of that PGW as described in 3GPP TS 29.303 [34].
If the ePDG determines that a previously assigned 3GPP AAA Sever is
unavailable, it may attempt to send a new authentication and authorization
request to an alternate 3GPP AAA Server. If the ePDG receives from this new
server a redirect indication towards the former server (due to the HSS having
stored the former 3GPP AAA Server identity), it shall terminate all previously
existing sessions and PDN connections for that user, and it shall re-send
again the request towards the new server, but it shall include the AAA-
Failure-Indication AVP in the new request.
#### 7.1.2.2 Authorization Procedures
##### 7.1.2.2.1 General
This procedure shall be used between the ePDG and 3GPP AAA Server and Proxy.
It shall be invoked by the ePDG, upon receipt of a valid Re-Authorization
Request message from the 3GPP AAA Server (see section 7.1.2.5).
This procedure shall be used by the ePDG to update the previously provided
authorization parameters. This may happen due to a modification of the
subscriber profile in the HSS (for example, removal of a specific APN
associated with the subscriber, or change of the identity of a dynamically
allocated PDN GW, see subclause 8.1.2.3).
This procedure is mapped to the Diameter command codes AA-Request (AAR) and
AA-Answer (AAA) specified in RFC 4005 [4]. Information element contents for
these messages are shown in tables 7.1.2.2.1/1 and 7.1.2.2.1/2.

##### 7.1.2.2.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Server shall process the steps in the following order (if there
is an error in any of the steps, the 3GPP AAA Server shall stop processing and
return the corresponding error code):
1) Check that the user exists in the 3GPP AAA Server. The check shall be based
on Diameter Session-id and User Name. If the Session-Id included in the
request does not correspond with any active session, or if an active session
is found but it does not belong to the user identified by the User Name
parameter, Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN.
2) Check whether the user is allowed to access the APN. If not, Result-Code
shall be set to DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED.
3) The 3GPP AAA Server shall return user data relevant to the APN as received
from the HSS. The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
Once the Authentication and Authorization procedure successfully finishes, the
3GPP AAA Server shall download, together with authentication data, the list of
authorized APNs and the authorized mobility protocols in the authentication
and authorization response from the HSS (see SWx procedure in Section
8.1.2.1).
Exceptions to the cases specified here shall be treated by 3GPP AAA Server as
error situations, the Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY
and, therefore, no authorization information shall be returned.
##### 7.1.2.2.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall be required to handle roaming cases in which the ePDG
is in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a stateful proxy, with the
following extensions.
On receipt of the authorization answer, the 3GPP AAA Proxy:
\- Shall check locally configured information for the maximum allowed static
QoS parameters valid for visitors from the given HPLMN and modify the QoS
parameters received from the 3GPP AAA Server, to enforce the policy
limitations.
\- Shall record the state of the connection (i.e. Authorization Successful).
##### 7.1.2.2.4 ePDG Detailed Behaviour
The ePDG shall initiate the authorization procedure after successfully
completing the authentication of the user. The ePDG shall initiate a separate
authorization session for each IKE_SA of the user.
If NBM is used, at successful completion of the procedure, the ePDG shall
store the APN configuration data received from the 3GPP AAA Server. The ePDG
shall utilize these data to authorize the requested home address types: IPv4
home address and/or IPv6 home network prefix.
NOTE: The user will be allowed to create PDN connections only to the
subscribed APNs and use the address types that are allowed by the subscribed
PDN types.
Upon receiving the authorization response:
\- If NBM is used and if any other Result-Code than DIAMETER_SUCCESS was
received in the response, the ePDG shall release the corresponding PDN
connection (PMIPv6 binding or GTPv2 tunnel) and IKE_SA of the user.
\- If DSMIPv6 is used,
\- If any other Result-Code than DIAMETER_SUCCESS was received, the ePDG shall
release the corresponding IKE_SA of the user.
\- If the Result-Code DIAMETER_SUCCESS was received in the response, the ePDG
shall update the previously provided authorization parameters.
NOTE: The ePDG knows if NBM is used or if a local IP address is assigned based
on the flags in the MIP6-Feature-Vector received during the initial
authentication and authorization procedure or based on preconfigured
information. If the PMIP6_SUPPORTED and/or the GTPv2_SUPPORTED flag are set in
the MIP6-Feature-Vector received from the 3GPP AAA Server, the ePDG knows that
NBM is used.
If GTPv2 is used on S2b and if the Trace-Info AVP including Trace-Data has
been received in the authorization response, the ePDG shall send a GTPv2 Trace
Session Activation message (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [38]) to the PGW to start a
trace session for the user. If the Trace-Info AVP including Trace-Reference
(directly under the Trace-Info) has been received in the authorization
response, the ePDG shall send a GTPv2 Trace Session Deactivation message to
the PGW to stop the ongoing trace session, identified by the Trace-Reference.
For details, see 3GPP TS 32.422 [32].
If DSMIPv6 is used and if ePDG has received the PGW identity in form of the
FQDN from the 3GPP AAA server, then the ePDG may obtain the IP address of the
Home Agent functionality of that PGW as described in 3GPP TS 29.303 [34].
#### 7.1.2.3 ePDG Initiated Session Termination Procedures
##### 7.1.2.3.1 General
The SWm reference point allows the ePDG to inform the 3GPP AAA Server/Proxy
about the termination of an IKE_SA between UE and ePDG, and that therefore the
mobility session established on the ePDG for all associated PDN connections
are to be removed.
The SWm Session Termination Request procedure shall be initiated by the ePDG
to the 3GPP AAA Server which shall remove associated non-3GPP Access
information. The AAA Server shall then return the SWm Session Termination
Answer containing the result of the operation. These procedures are based on
the reuse of Diameter Base IETF RFC 3588 [7] STR and STA commands
Table 7.1.2.3.1/1: SWm Session Termination Request

Information Element name Mapping to Diameter AVP Cat. Description Permanent
User Identity User-Name M This information element shall contain the permanent
identity of the user. The identity shall be represented in NAI form as
specified in IETF RFC 4282 [15] and shall be formatted as defined in clause 19
of 3GPP TS 23.003 [14]; this IE shall not include the leading digit prepended
in front of the IMSI used to differentiate between authentication schemes.

Information Element name Mapping to Diameter AVP Cat. Description Result
Result-Code M This IE shall contain the result of the operation.
* * *
##### 7.1.2.3.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behavior
Upon reception of the Session Termination Request message from the ePDG, the
3GPP AAA Server shall check that there is an ongoing session associated to the
two parameters received (Session-Id and User-Name).
If an active session is found and it belongs to the user identified by the
User-Name parameter, the 3GPP AAA Server shall release the session resources
associated to the specified session and a Session Termination Response shall
be sent to the ePDG, indicating DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
Otherwise, the 3GPP AAA Server returns a Session Termination Response with the
Diameter Error DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.
##### 7.1.2.3.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behavior
The 3GPP AAA Proxy is required to handle roaming cases in which the ePDG is
located in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a stateful proxy.
On receipt of the Session Termination Request message from the ePDG, the 3GPP
AAA Proxy shall route the message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
On receipt of the Session Termination Answer message from the 3GPP AAA Server,
the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall route the message to the ePDG, and it shall release
any local resources associated to the specified session only if the result
code is set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
#### 7.1.2.4 3GPP AAA Server Initiated Session Termination Procedures
##### 7.1.2.4.1 General
The SWm reference point shall allow the 3GPP AAA Server to request the
termination of an IKE_SA between UE and ePDG, and therefore the termination of
all mobility session established for all associated PDN connections.
If the user has several accesses (IKE_SA) active at an ePDG, a separate
Session Termination procedure shall be initiated for each of them.
The procedure shall be initiated by the 3GPP AAA Server. This procedure is
based on the reuse of NASREQ IETF RFC 4005 [4] ASR, ASA, STR and STA commands.
Table 7.1.2.4.1/1: SWm Abort Session Request
* * *
Information Element name Mapping to Diameter AVP Cat. Description Permanent
User Identity User-Name M This information element shall contain the permanent
identity of the user. The identity shall be represented in NAI form as

##### 7.1.2.4.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Server shall make use of this procedure to instruct the ePDG to
terminate the IKE_SA between UE and ePDG.
In the DSMIPv6 case, the 3GPP AAA Server shall initiate first the detach
procedure over the S6b reference point towards the PDN GW. When this process
has finalized, the 3GPP AAA Server can initiate the termination of the IKE_SA
towards the ePDG.
The 3GPP AAA Server shall include the Auth-Session-State AVP in the ASR
command with a value of NO_STATE_MAINTAINED if it does not require a STR from
the ePDG. If it does require a STR from the ePDG, the 3GPP AAA Server shall
either omit the Auth-Session-State AVP from the ASR command or include the
Auth-Session-State AVP in the ASR command with a value of STATE_MAINTAINED.
On receipt of the ASR command, the ePDG shall check if there is an ongoing
session associated with the received Session-Id. If an active session is found
and it belongs to the user identified by the User-Name parameter, the ePDG
shall terminate the associated IKE_SA between UE and ePDG and return an ASA to
the 3GPP AAA Server with the Result-Code to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. Otherwise, the
ePDG shall return an ASA to the 3GPP AAA Server with the Result-Code set to
DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.
On receipt of the ASA with a Result-Code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS, the 3GPP AAA
Server shall release any local resources associated with the specified
session.
If required by the 3GPP AAA Server, the ePDG shall send an STR with the
Termination-Cause set to DIAMETER_ADMINISTRATIVE. The 3GPP AAA Server shall
set the Result-Code to DIAMETER_SUCCESS and return the STA command to the
ePDG.
##### 7.1.2.4.3 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
When the 3GPP AAA Proxy receives the ASR from the 3GPP AAA Server it shall
route the request to the ePDG.
If the 3GPP AAA Proxy requires an STR but the 3GPP AAA Server does not, the
3GPP AAA Proxy may override the value of the Auth-Session-State in the ASR and
set it to STATE_MAINTAINED. In this case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall not forward
the STR received from the ePDG onto the 3GPP AAA Server and shall return an
STA command to the ePDG with the Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. The 3GPP
AAA Proxy shall not override the value of the Auth-Session-State AVP under any
other circumstances.
On receipt of the ASA message with Diameter Result Code set to
DIAMETER_SUCCESS, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall route the successful response to
the 3GPP AAA Server and shall release any local resources associated with the
session.
When the 3GPP AAA Proxy receives the STR from ePDG, it shall route the request
to the 3GPP AAA Server. On receipt of the STA message, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
shall route the response to the ePDG.
#### 7.1.2.5 Authorization Information Update Procedures
##### 7.1.2.5.1 General
This procedure shall be used between the 3GPP AAA Server and the ePDG for the
purpose of modifying the previously provided authorization parameters. This
may happen due to a modification of the subscriber profile in the HSS (for
example change of the identity of a dynamically allocated PDN GW, see
subclause 8.1.2.3).
This procedure shall be performed in two steps:
\- The 3GPP AAA Server shall issue an unsolicited re-authorization request
towards the ePDG. Upon receipt of such a request, the ePDG shall respond to
the request and indicate the disposition of the request. This procedure is
based on the Diameter commands Re-Auth-Request and Re-Auth-Answer specified in
IETF RFC 3588 [7]. Information element contents for these messages shall be as
shown in tables 7.1.2.5.1/1 and 7.1.2.5.1/2.
\- Upon receiving the re-authorization request, the ePDG shall immediately
invoke the authorization procedure specified in 7.1.2.2 for the session
indicated in the request. This procedure is based on the Diameter commands Re-
Auth-Request (RAR) and Re-Auth-Answer (RAA) specified in IETF RFC 4005 [4].
Information element contents for these messages are shown in tables
7.1.2.2.1/1 and 7.1.2.2.1/2.
Table 7.1.2.5.1/1: SWm Authorization Information Update Request

Information Element name Mapping to Diameter AVP Cat. Description Permanent
User Identity User-Name M This information element shall contain the permanent
identity of the user. The identity shall be represented in NAI form as
specified in IETF RFC 4282 [15] and shall be formatted as defined in clause 19
of 3GPP TS 23.003 [14]; this IE shall not include the leading digit prepended
in front of the IMSI used to differentiate between authentication schemes. Re-
Auth Request Type Re-Auth-Request-Type M This IE shall define whether the user
is to be authorized only or authenticated and authorized. AUTHORIZE_ONLY shall
be set in this case. Routing Information Destination-Host M This information
element shall be obtained from the Origin-Host AVP, which was included in a
previous command received from the trusted non-3GPP access.

##### 7.1.2.5.2 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA server shall make use of the re-authorization procedure defined
in the Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 3588 [7] to indicate that relevant
service authorization information shall be updated in the ePDG.
##### 7.1.2.5.3 ePDG Detailed Behaviour
Upon receipt of the Re-authorization Request message from the 3GPP AAA Server
or the 3GPP AAA Proxy, the ePDG shall check that there is an ongoing session
associated to any of the parameters received in the message (identified by the
Session-Id AVP and the User-Name AVP).
If an active session is found, the ePDG shall initiate an authorization
procedure for the session identified by the Session-Id AVP and the User-Name
AVP and a Re-authorization Answer message shall be sent to the 3GPP AAA Server
or the 3GPP AAA Proxy with the Result-Code indicating DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
If the Session-Id included in the request does not correspond with any active
session, or if an active session is found but it does not belong to the user
identified by the User Name parameter, then an Re-authorization Answer message
shall be sent to the 3GPP AAA Server or the 3GPP AAA Proxy with the Result-
Code indicating DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.
Exceptions to the cases specified here shall be treated by ePDG as error
situations, the Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY and,
therefore, no authorization procedure shall be initiated.
Table 7.1.2.5.3/1 details the valid result codes that the ePDG can return in
the response.
Table 7.1.2.5.3/1: Re-authorization Answer valid result codes

## 7.2 Protocol Specification
### 7.2.1 General
The SWm reference point shall be based on Diameter, as defined in IETF RFC
3588 [7] and contain the following additions and extensions:

Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) services in the Network
Access Server (NAS) environment.
\- IETF RFC 4072 [5], which provides a Diameter application to support the
transport of EAP (IETF RFC 3748 [8]) frames over Diameter.
\- IETF RFC 5779 [2], which defines a Diameter extensions and application for
PMIPv6 MAG to AAA and LMA to AAA interfaces.
\- IETF RFC 5447 [6], which defines Diameter extensions for Mobile IPv6 NAS to
AAA interface.
In the case of an untrusted non-3GPP IP access, the MAG to 3GPP AAA server or
the MAG to 3GPP AAA proxy communication shall use the MAG to AAA interface
functionality defined in IETF RFC 5779 [2] and the NAS to AAA interface
functionality defined in IETF RFC 5447 [6].

#### 7.2.3.2 Feature-List-ID AVP
The syntax of this AVP is defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [24]. For this release,
the Feature-List-ID AVP value shall be set to 1 for the SWm application.
#### 7.2.3.3 Feature-List AVP
The syntax of this AVP is defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [24]. A null value
indicates that there is no feature used by the SWm application.
NOTE: There are no SWm features defined for this release.
### 7.2.4 Session Handling
The Diameter protocol between the ePDG and the 3GPP AAA Server or the 3GPP AAA
Proxy shall always keep the session state, and use the same Session-Id
parameter for the lifetime of each Diameter session.
A Diameter session shall identify
\- a PDN Connection of a given user, if NBM is used
\- a user, if DSMIPv6 is used.
In order to indicate that the session state is to be maintained, the Diameter
client and server shall not include the Auth-Session-State AVP, either in the
request or in the response messages (see IETF RFC 3588 [7]).
# 8 SWx Description
## 8.1 Functionality
### 8.1.1 General
The SWx reference point is defined between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS.
The description of the reference point and its functionality is given in 3GPP
TS 23.402 [3].
The SWx reference point is used to authorize the UE and to transport NBM
related mobility parameters when NBM is used to establish connectivity to the
EPC.
The SWx is used to authenticate and authorize the UE when the S2a, S2b or S2c
reference points are used to connect to EPC. This reference point is also used
to update the HSS with the PDN-GW address information. Additionally, this
reference point may be used to retrieve and update other mobility related
parameters including static QoS profiles for non-3GPP accesses.
Additional requirements for the SWx interface can be found in section 12 of
3GPP TS 23.402 [3].
### 8.1.2 Procedures Description
#### 8.1.2.1 Authentication Procedure
##### 8.1.2.1.1 General
This procedure is used between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS. The procedure
is invoked by the 3GPP AAA Server when a new set of authentication information
for a given subscriber is to be retrieved from an HSS. This can happen for
example, when a new trusted or untrusted non 3GPP/IP access subscriber has
accessed the 3GPP AAA Server for authentication or when a new set of
authentication information is required for one of the subscribers already
registered in the 3GPP AAA server. The procedure shall be invoked by 3GPP AAA
Server when it detects that the VPLMN or access network has changed.

##### 8.1.2.1.2 Detailed behaviour
The HSS shall, in the following order (if there is an error in any of the
steps, the HSS shall stop processing and return the corresponding error code):
1\. Check that the user exists in the HSS. If not Experimental-Result-Code
shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN.
2\. Check that the user has non-3GPP subscription. If not Experimental-Result-
Code shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_NO_NON_3GPP_SUBSCRIPTON.
3\. If a Visited-Network-Identifier is present, check that the user is allowed
to roam in the visited network. If the user is not allowed to roam in the
visited network, Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR
_ROAMING_NOT_ALLOWED.
4\. Check RAT-Type AVP. If the access type indicates any value that is
restricted for the user, then the Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_ERROR_RAT_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED.
5\. The HSS shall check if there is an existing 3GPP AAA Server already
assisting the user
\- If there is a 3GPP AAA Server already serving the user, the HSS shall
compare the 3GPP AAA server name received in the request to the 3GPP AAA
Server name stored in the HSS.
\- If they are not identical and the received message contains the AAA-
Failure-Indication AVP, the HSS shall remove the old 3GPP AAA Server name
previously assigned for this subscriber, and store the name of the new 3GPP
AAA Server that sent the request containing the AAA-Failure-Indication AVP,
and continue from step 6. The HSS should attempt to notify the old 3GPP AAA
Server about the new server assignment, by means of the network initiated de-
registration procedure (see sub-clause 8.1.2.2.3) indicating as reason code
\"NEW_SERVER_ASSIGNED\".
\- If they are not identical the HSS shall return the old 3GPP AAA Server to
the requester 3GPP AAA Server and return an error by setting the Experimental-
Result-Code to DIAMETER_ERROR_IDENTITY_ALREADY_REGISTERED.
\- The requester 3GPP AAA Server, upon detection of a 3GPP AAA Server name in
the response assumes that the user already has a 3GPP AAA Server assigned, so
makes use of Diameter redirect function to indicate the 3GPP AAA Server name
where to address the authentication request.
6\. The HSS shall check the request type.
\- If the request indicates there is a synchronization failure, the HSS shall
process AUTS as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 [16] and return the requested
authentication information. The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
> \- If the request indicates authentication, the HSS shall generate the
> authentication vectors for the requested authentication method, EAP-AKA or
> EAP-AKA\', as described in 3GPP TS 33.402 [19]. The HSS shall download
> Authentication-Data-Item up to a maximum specified in SIP-Number-Auth-Items
> received in the command Multimedia-Auth-Request. The result code shall be
> set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
\- If there is no 3GPP AAA Server already serving the user, the HSS shall
store the received 3GPP AAA Server name.
Exceptions to the cases specified here shall be treated by HSS as error
situations, the Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY. No
authentication information shall be returned.
Origin-Host AVP shall contain the 3GPP AAA Server identity.
#### 8.1.2.2 Location Management Procedures
##### 8.1.2.2.1 General
According to the requirements described in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3], SWx reference
point shall enable:
\- Registration of the 3GPP AAA Server serving an authorized trusted or
untrusted non-3GPP access user in the HSS.
\- Retrieval of charging-related information from HSS.
\- Deregistration procedure between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS.
\- Retrieval of subscriber profile from HSS.
##### 8.1.2.2.2 UE/PDN Registration/DeRegistration Notification
###### 8.1.2.2.2.1 General
This procedure is used between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS.
\- To register the current 3GPP AAA Server address in the HSS for a given
non-3GPP user. This procedure is invoked by the 3GPP AAA Server after a new
subscriber has been authenticated by the 3GPP AAA Server.
\- To de-register the current 3GPP AAA Server address in the HSS for a given
non-3GPP user. When the 3GPP AAA Server is going to remove the access
information for a non-3GPP user (i.e. the STa, SWm, S6b sessions are
terminated) or when the OCS has initiated a disconnection, the 3GPP AAA Server
informs the HSS about an ongoing disconnection process and the HSS de-
registers the non-3GPP user.
\- To download the subscriber profile to the 3GPP AAA Server on demand. This
procedure is invoked when for some reason the subscription profile of a
subscriber is lost.
\- To update the HSS with the identity and the PLMN ID of a dynamically
allocated PDN GW as a result of the first PDN connection establishment

###### 8.1.2.2.2.2 Detailed behaviour
When a new trusted or untrusted non-3GPP IP access subscriber has been
authenticated by the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server initiates the
registration towards the HSS. The HSS shall, in the event of an error in any
of the steps, stop processing and return the corresponding error code.
At reception of the Non-3GPP IP Access Registration, the HSS shall perform (in
the following order):
1\. Check that the user is known. If not Experimental-Result-Code shall be set
to DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN.
2\. The HSS shall check if there is an existing 3GPP AAA Server already
assisting the user
\- If there is a 3GPP AAA Server already serving the user, the HSS shall
compare the 3GPP AAA Server name received in the request to the 3GPP AAA
Server name stored in the HSS.
\- If they are not identical the HSS shall return the old 3GPP AAA Server to
the requester 3GPP AAA Server and return an error by setting the Experimental-
Result-Code to DIAMETER_ERROR_IDENTITY_ALREADY_REGISTERED.\ \ The requester
3GPP AAA Server, upon detection of a 3GPP AAA Server name in the response
assumes that the user already has a 3GPP AAA Server assigned, so makes use of
Diameter redirect function to indicate the 3GPP AAA Server name where to
address the Non-3GPP IP Access Registration request.
\- If they are identical but there is no APN configuration information in HSS
for the user, the HSS shall return the Experimental Result Code
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_NO_NON_3GPP_SUBSCRIPTION and it shall remove the 3GPP AAA
Server name previously assigned for this subscriber.
\- If there is not a 3GPP AAA Server already serving the user, the HSS shall
return an error, setting the Result-Code to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY in the
Response command.
3\. After the HSS has determined that the requesting 3GPP AAA server is
identical to the registered 3GPP AAA server, the HSS shall check the Server
Assignment Type value received in the request:
\- If it indicates REGISTRATION, the HSS shall set the subscribers User Status
to REGISTERED for the authenticated and authorized trusted or untrusted
non-3GPP IP access subscriber, download the relevant user profile information
and set the Result-Code AVP to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Server-Assignment-
Response command. For those APNs that have been authorized as a consequence of
having the Wildcard APN in the user subscription, the HSS shall include the
specific APN name and associated PDN-GW identity inside the APN context of the
Wildcard APN.
\- If it indicates USER_DEREGISTRATION / ADMINISTRATIVE_DEREGISTRATION /
AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE / AUTHENTICATION_TIMEOUT, the HSS shall remove the 3GPP
AAA Server name previously assigned for the subscriber, set the User Status
for the subscriber to NOT_REGISTERED and set the Result-Code AVP to
DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Server-Assignment-Response command. The HSS shall not
remove the stored dynamic PGW-ID and APN information for the subscriber.
\- If it indicates AAA_USER_DATA_REQUEST, the HSS shall download the relevant
user profile information to the requester 3GPP AAA Server and set the Result-
Code AVP to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Response command.
\- If it indicates PGW_UPDATE, the HSS shall check if the subscriber is
registered.
If the subscriber is registered and there is not a static PDN GW subscribed,
the HSS shall store the PGW identity and PLMN (if it is received in the
command) for the non-3GPP user and the APN identified by the APN Id or by the
Context Identifier if present in the request; otherwise, the HSS shall not
update or delete the stored PDN GW and, for this case, shall set the result
code to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
> If the APN corresponding to the PGW identity is not present in the
> subscription but the wild card APN is present in the subscription, the HSS
> shall store the new PDN GW identity and PLMN for an APN if present in the
> request. The HSS shall set the Result-Code AVP to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the
> Server-Assignment-Response command. If the Context Identifier is included in
> the request, the HSS may use it to locate the APN Configuration.
If the APN corresponding to the PGW identity is not present in the
subscription and the wild card APN is not present in the subscription, the HSS
shall reject the request and set the Result-Code AVP to
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
If the subscriber is not registered, the HSS shall reject the request and set
the Experimental-Result-Code AVP to DIAMETER_ERROR_IDENTITY_NOT_REGISTERED.
\- If it indicates any other value, the Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO COMPLY, and no registration/de-registration or profile
download procedure shall be performed.
Origin-Host AVP shall contain the 3GPP AAA Server identity.
Once the 3GPP AAA Server has received the user profile data as a result of
successful registration to the HSS, the 3GPP AAA Server shall create
appropriate routing policies and IP filtering information according to the
retrieved operator defined barring information. These routing policies and IP
filtering information are used for the subsequent authorizations by the MAG
functionality in the trusted 3GPP/IP access, or ePDG or PGW. If the
subscription data received for a certain APN indicates that the APN was
authorized as a consequence of having the Wildcard APN in the user
subscription in HSS, then the 3GPP AAA Server shall not store this APN data
beyond the lifetime of the UE sessions related to the specific APN and the
3GPP AAA Server shall delete them upon disconnection of the UE. If the PGW
Identity contains an FQDN of the PDN GW, the 3GPP AAA Server shall retrieve
the PGW PLMN ID from the MIP-Home-Agent-Host AVP within the MIP6-Agent-Info
AVP which contains the PGW Identity.
The 3GPP AAA Server may be configured by local policy to not update the HSS
with the PGW Identity used over TWAN for the default APN of the user (i.e. to
skip the Non-3GPP IP Access Registration request with Server-Assignment-Type
set to \"PGW_UPDATE\").
NOTE: This 3GPP AAA Server option can be used when the same APN is configured
for TWAN and other access technologies in which case the network can select
different PDN GWs for PDN connections to this APN. Updating the HSS with the
selected PDN GW identity for Trusted WLAN access could affect PDN connections
over other access technologies.
##### 8.1.2.2.3 Network Initiated De-Registration by HSS, Administrative
###### 8.1.2.2.3.1 General
This procedure is used between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS to remove a
previous registration and all associated state. When the de-registration
procedure is initiated by HSS, indicating that a subscription has to be
removed, the 3GPP AAA Server subsequently triggers the detach procedure via
the appropriate interface.

###### 8.1.2.2.3.2 Detailed behaviour
The HSS shall de-register the affected identity and invoke this procedure to
inform the 3GPP AAA server to remove the subscribed user from the 3GPP AAA
Server.
The HSS shall send in the Deregistration-Reason AVP the reason for the de-
registration, composed by a textual message (if available) aimed for the user
and a reason code that determines the action the 3GPP AAA server has to
perform. The possible reason codes are:
\- PERMANENT_TERMINATION: The non-3gpp subscription or service profile(s) has
been permanently terminated. The HSS shall clear the user\'s 3GPP AAA Server
name and set the User Status to NOT_REGISTERED. The 3GPP AAA Server should
start the network initiated de-registration towards the user.
\- NEW_SERVER_ASSIGNED: The HSS indicates to the 3GPP AAA Server that a new
3GPP AAA Server has been allocated to the user (e.g. because the previous
assigned 3GPP AAA Server was found unavailable at a certain point). The 3GPP
AAA Server shall remove all user data and session information for the user
indicated in the de-registration request. The 3GPP AAA Server shall not start
the network initiated de-registration towards the user.
#### 8.1.2.3 HSS Initiated Update of User Profile
##### 8.1.2.3.1 General
According to the requirements described in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3] and 3GPP TS
32.422 [32], SWx reference point shall enable:
  * Indication to 3GPP AAA Server of change of non-3GPP subscriber profile within HSS;
  * Activation and deactivation of the subscriber and equipment trace in the PDN GW.
This procedure is used between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS. The procedure
is invoked by the HSS when the subscriber profile has been modified and needs
to be sent to the 3GPP AAA Server. This may happen due to a modification in
the HSS.
The procedure is also invoked by the HSS to update the 3GPP AAA Server with
the identity of a dynamically allocated PDN GW which is included in the APN-
Configuration AVP in the User Profile as a result of the first PDN connection
establishment associated with an APN over 3GPP access.
This procedure is mapped to the Diameter command codes Push-Profile-Request
(PPR) and Push-Profile-Answer (PPA) specified in the 3GPP TS 29.229 [24].

##### 8.1.2.3.2 HSS Detailed behaviour
The HSS shall make use of this procedure to update the relevant user profile
in the 3GPP AAA server (e.g. change of subscription data or change of the
identity of a dynamically allocated PDN GW associated with an APN), or
activate / deactivate subscriber and equipment trace in the PDN GW.
##### 8.1.2.3.3 3GPP AAA Server Detailed behaviour
The 3GPP AAA server shall overwrite, for the subscriber identity indicated in
the request, current information with the information received from the HSS,
except in the error situations detailed in table 8.1.2.3.3/1.
After a successful user profile download, the 3GPP AAA server shall initiate
re-authentication procedure as described in sub-clause 7.2.2.4 if the
subscriber has previously been authenticated and authorized to untrusted
non-3GPP access. If the subscriber has previously been authenticated and
authorized to trusted Non-3GPP IP Access then the 3GPP AAA server shall
initiate a re-authorization procedure as described in sub-clause 5.1.2.3.
Following a successful user profile download, the 3GPP AAA server shall apply
routing policies and IP filtering information as described in clause
8.1.2.2.2. . As multiple authorization sessions may exist for the user (see
section 7.1.2.1), the 3GPP AAA server shall examine the need to execute re-
authorization for each of these sessions, and may execute the multiple re-
authorization procedures in parallel. In case the user\'s non-3GPP
subscription has been deleted or the user\'s APN has been barred, the re-
authorization shall be executed in all ongoing user related authorization
sessions. Otherwise, the re-authorization procedure shall be invoked for the
authorization sessions for which at least one of the following conditions is
fulfilled:
\- The user\'s subscribed APN has been deleted from the HSS.
\- The APN configuration data has been previously downloaded to the ePDG and
the new version of APN configuration received from HSS reflects a modification
in these data.
Following a successful download of subscription and equipment trace data, the
3GPP AAA Server shall forward the trace data by initiating reauthorization
towards all PDN GWs that have an active authorization session.

##### 8.1.2.4.1.2 HSS Detailed behaviour
The HSS shall use this procedure to indicate to the 3GPP AAA Server about a
restart event, affecting a set of users, for whom their registration data and
dynamic data may have been lost. The HSS shall only send this command if the
3GPP AAA Server has indicated support for the \"HSS Restoration\" feature. In
this case, the HSS shall set the Reset-Indication bit in the PPR-Flags AVP in
the PPR command.
NOTE: If there are multiple 3GPP AAA Servers deployed in the HPLMN, and the
HSS is configured (in an implementation-specific manner) in such a way that it
can determine that a certain 3GPP AAA Server does not contain any of the users
affected by the restart, it can skip sending the PPR command to that specific
3GPP AAA Server.
##### 8.1.2.4.1.3 3GPP AAA Server Detailed behaviour
If the 3GPP AAA Server supports the \"HSS Restoration\" feature, it shall
answer with a successful result to the PPR command, and it shall mark those
users affected by the HSS restart as \"pending to be restored in HSS\".
The 3GPP AAA Server shall use the HSS Identity received in the Origin-Host AVP
(by comparing it with the value stored after a successful MAA command) and may
make use of the received \"User List\" Information Element in order to
determine which subscriber records are impacted, if any. If the 3GPP AAA
Server determines that there are no subscribers affected by the HSS restart,
it shall answer with a successful result to the HSS.
##### 8.1.2.4.2 HSS Restoration
###### 8.1.2.4.2.1 General
This procedure is used by the 3GPP AAA Server to restore in the HSS the
registration data and the dynamic data for a certain user. The 3GPP AAA Sever
shall use this procedure only after having received a previous indication from
HSS of a restart event affecting that user.
This procedure is mapped to the Diameter command codes Server-Assignment-
Request (SAR) and Server-Assignment-Answer (SAA) specified in the 3GPP TS
29.229 [24]. Information element contents for these messages are shown in
tables 8.1.2.4.2.1/1 and 8.1.2.4.2.1/2.

##### 8.1.2.4.2.2 HSS Detailed behaviour
Upon receipt of the SAR command, if the HSS supports the \"HSS Restoration\"
feature, and the user's IMSI is known, the HSS shall update the registration
data (from the Origin-Host AVP received in the 3GPP AAA Server command) and
dynamic data of the user (included in the \"Active APN\" Information Element),
and answer with a successful result.
##### 8.1.2.4.2.3 3GPP AAA Server Detailed behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Server shall use this command to update the HSS with the
registration data and dynamic data it has for a user affected by the HSS
restart, identified by the \"User List\" IE received previously in the PPR
command, and marked in the 3GPP AAA Server as \"pending to be restored in
HSS\". The 3GPP AAA Server shall only make use of this procedure in the HSS
has indicated support for the \"HSS Restoration\" feature.
The 3GPP AAA Server shall invoke the SAR command towards the HSS, after having
received further interactions over other reference points (S6b, STa, SWm ...)
for a user marked as \"pending to be restored in HSS\".
Once the 3GPP AAA Server receives confirmation from HSS, in the SAA command,
that the user has been successfully restored in the HSS, via the \"HSS
Restoration Response\" command, it shall clear the \"pending to be restored in
HSS\" flag for that user.
## 8.2 Protocol Specification

### 8.2.4 Session Handling
The Diameter protocol between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS shall not keep
the session state and each Diameter request/response interaction shall be
transported over a different diameter session which is implicitly terminated.
In order to indicate that session state shall not be maintained, the diameter
client and server shall include the Auth-Session-State AVP set to the value
NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1), as described in IETF RFC 3588 [7]. As a consequence,
the server shall not maintain any state information about this session and the
client shall not send any session termination request. Neither the
Authorization-Lifetime AVP nor the Session-Timeout AVP shall be present in
requests or responses.
## 8.3 User identity to HSS resolution
The User identity to HSS resolution mechanism enables the 3GPP AAA server to
find the identity of the HSS that holds the subscriber data for a given user
identity when multiple and separately addressable HSSs have been deployed by
the network operator. The resolution mechanism is not required in networks
that utilise a single HSS or when a 3GPP AAA server is configured to use pre-
defined HSS address/identity.
This User identity to HSS resolution mechanism may rely on routing
capabilitites provided by Diameter and be implemented in the home operator
network within dedicated Diameter Agents (Redirect Agents or Proxy Agents)
responsible for determining the HSS identity based on the provided user
identity. If this Diameter based implementation is selected by the Home
network operator, the principles described below shall apply.
In networks where more than one independently addressable HSS are utilized by
a network operator, and the 3GPP AAA server is not configured to use pre-
defined HSS address/identity, each 3GPP AAA server shall be configured with
the address/identity of the Diameter Agent (Redirect Agent or Proxy Agent)
implementing this resolution mechanism.
To get the HSS identity that holds the subscriber data for a given user
identity, the 3GPP AAA server shall send the Diameter request normally
destined to the HSS to a pre-configured address/identity of a Diameter agent
supporting the User identity to HSS resolution mechanism.
\- If this Diameter request is received by a Diameter Redirect Agent, the
Diameter Redirect Agent shall determine the HSS identity based on the provided
user identity and sends to the 3GPP AAA server a notification of redirection
towards the HSS identity, in response to the Diameter request. Multiple HSS
identities may be included in the response from the Diameter Redirect Agent,
as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [7]. In such a case, the 3GPP AAA server shall
send the Diameter request to the first HSS identity in the ordered list
received in the Diameter response from the Diameter Redirect Agent. If no
successful response to the Diameter request is received, the 3GPP AAA server
shall send a Diameter request to the next HSS identity in the ordered list.
This procedure shall be repeated until a successful response from an HSS is
received.
\- If this Diameter request is received by a Diameter Proxy Agent, the
Diameter Proxy Agent shall determine the HSS identity based on the provided
user identity and shall forward the Diameter request directly to the HSS. The
3GPP AAA server shall determine the HSS identity from the response to the
Diameter request received from the HSS.
After the User identity to HSS resolution, the 3GPP AAA server shall store the
HSS identity/name/Realm and shall use it in further Diameter requests
associated to the same user dentity.
NOTE: Alternatives to the user identity to HSS resolution Diameter based
implementation are outside the scope of this specification.
# 9 S6b and H2 Description
## 9.1 Functionality
### 9.1.1 General
The S6b reference point is defined between the 3GPP AAA Server and the PDN-GW.
The definition of the reference point and its functionality is given in 3GPP
TS 23.402 [3].
When the UE attaches to the EPC using the S2c reference point, the S6b
reference point is used to authenticate and authorize the UE, and update the
PDN-GW address to the 3GPP AAA server and HSS.
When the UE attaches to the EPC using the S2a/S2b reference point in the
PMIPv6 or GTPv2 mode, the S6b reference point is used to update the 3GPP AAA
server or the 3GPP AAA proxy with the PDN-GW address information and with the
selected S2a/S2b protocol variant. Furthermore, this reference point may be
used to retrieve and update other mobility related parameters including static
QoS profiles for non-3GPP accesses.
The S6b reference point is also used to authenticate and authorize the
incoming MIPv4 Registration Request in the case the UE attaches to the EPC
over the S2a reference point using MIPv4 FACoA procedures.
The S6b reference point is used by the 3GPP AAA Server in the case the UE
attaches to the EPC using the S2c reference point to indicate to the PDN GW
that a PDN GW reallocation shall be performed. This indication triggers the
actual Home Agent reallocation procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.303 [13].
The S6b reference point is also used to download subscriber and equipment
trace information to the PDN GW.
The H2 reference point is defined between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HA. The
definition of the reference point and its functionality is given in 3GPP TS
23.327 [12].
NOTE: The H2 interface is a subset of the S6b interface in the sense that only
the DSMIPv6 procedures and the respective AVPs are implemented. Therefore, in
the context of DSMIPv6 the procedures described in this specification apply to
both S6b and H2.
### 9.1.2 Procedures Description
#### 9.1.2.1 Authentication and Authorization Procedures when using DSMIPv6
##### 9.1.2.1.1 General
The S6b interface shall enable the authentication and authorization between
the UE and the 3GPP AAA Server/Proxy for DSMIPv6.
When an UE performs the DSMIPv6 initial attach, it runs an IKEv2 exchange with
the PDN GW as specified in 3GPP TS 24.303 [13]. In this exchange EAP AKA is
used for UE authentication over IKEv2. The PDN GW acts as an IKEv2 responder
and an EAP pass-through authenticator for this authentication.
The S6b authentication and authorization procedure is invoked by the PDN GW
after receiving an IKE_SA_AUTH message from the UE. The S6b reference point
performs authentication based on reuse of the DER/DEA command set defined in
Diameter EAP. The exact procedure follows the steps specified in IETF RFC 5778
[11].
NOTE: This procedure is only used with DSMIPv6-capable UEs; therefore, only
PDNs with PDN Types IPv6 or IPv4v6 are accessible in this case.

##### 9.1.2.1.2 PDN GW Detailed Behaviour
After completing the IKE_SA_INIT exchange, upon receipt of an IKE_AUTH
message, including the IDi payload but not the AUTH payload, the PDN GW shall
send an Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message towards the 3GPP AAA Server /
Proxy. The EAP Payload AVP shall contain an EAP-Response/Identity with the
identity extracted from the IDi field.
Upon receipt of an IKE_AUTH message with an EAP payload from the UE, the PDN
GW shall send an Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) with the EAP Payload AVP
containing the according EAP-Response to the 3GPP AAA Server / Proxy.
Upon receipt of a Diameter-EAP-Answer (DEA) message from the 3GPP AAA Server /
Proxy, the PDN GW shall then send an IKE_AUTH message containing the according
EAP Payload to the UE.
Upon receipt of an IKE_AUTH message with the AUTH payload after the EAP
authentication was successful, the PDN_GW shall proceed as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.303 [13].
If the handover indication to the PGW is missing, i.e. IPv6 Home Network
Prefix assigned to the UE is not included in IKE_AUTH request message as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.303 [13], the PGW shall notify 3GPP AAA Server that
the UE performs initial attach by setting Initial-Attach-Indicator in the
DER-S6b-flags AVP.
The PDN GW shall utilize the downloaded APN configuration data, among others,
to decide whether the user\'s request for an IPv4 home address and/or IPv6
home address prefix shall be accepted or rejected.
If the Result-Code AVP is set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS_RELOCATE_HA and if the PGW
has received a PGW identity in form of the FQDN from the 3GPP AAA server, then
the PGW may obtain the IP address of the Home Agent functionality of that PGW
as described in 3GPP TS 29.303 [34].
If Trace-Info AVP has been received in the authentication and authorization
response, the PDN GW shall start a trace session for the user. For details,
see 3GPP TS 32.422 [32].
If the PDN-GW determines that a previously assigned 3GPP AAA Sever is
unavailable, it may attempt to send a new authentication and authorization
request to an alternate 3GPP AAA Server. If the PDN-GW receives from this new
server a redirect indication towards the former server (due to the HSS having
stored the former 3GPP AAA Server identity), it shall terminate all previously
existing sessions and PDN connections for that user, and it shall re-send
again the request towards the new server, but it shall include the AAA-
Failure-Indication AVP in the new request.
##### 9.1.2.1.3 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
For S6b, on receipt of the DER message, the 3GPP AAA Server shall process the
DER message according to 3GPP TS 33.402 [19]. For H2, the 3GPP AAA server
shall process the DER message according to 3GPP TS 33.234 [10].
Upon successful completion, a DIAMETER_SUCCESS shall be returned to indicate
successful authentication procedure and authentication information shall be
returned. The AAA server shall also include, among others, the MIP6-Feature-
Vector AVP, including the subscriber profile of the UE in terms of DSMIPv6
feature the UE is authorized to use.
If the HSS indicates that the user is currently being served by a different
PDN GW, the 3GPP AAA Server shall respond to to the PDN GW with the Result-
Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS_RELOCATE_HA and include the new assigned PDN GW
identity in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP.
If receiving the UE Care of Address from the PDN GW and Initial-Attach-
Indicator set by the PGW in DER-S6b-flags, the 3GPP AAA Server may select a
different PDN GW which is closer to the UE than the currently serving PDN GW
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3] based on the received UE Care of Address.
In this case, the 3GPP AAA Server shall respond to the PDN GW with the Result-
Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS_RELOCATE_HA and include the selected PDN GW
identity in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP.
If the HSS indicates that the user is currently being served by a different
3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server shall respond to the PDG-GW with the
Result-Code set to DIAMETER_REDIRECT_INDICATION and Redirect-Host set to the
Diameter URI of the 3GPP AAA Server currently serving the user (this Diameter
URI shall be constructed based on the Diameter Identity included in the 3GPP-
AAA-Server-Name AVP returned in the SWx authentication response from the HSS).
If the 3GPP AAA Server receives a request message not related to any existing
session and is able to recognize that the PDN-GW included the AAA-Failure-
Indication AVP in the request, the 3GPP AAA Server shall also include the AAA-
Failure-Indication AVP over the SWx interface, while retrieving the access
authentication and authorization data from the HSS.
The 3GPP AAA Server shall run EAP-AKA as specified in 3GPP TS 33.402 [19].
Exceptions shall be treated as error situations and the result code shall be
set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
Before sending out the AKA challenge, the 3GPP AAA Server shall decide whether
the access network is handled as Trusted or Untrusted and set the value of the
AN-Trusted AVP correspondingly in the answer message to indicate the trust
relationship of the access network to the PDN GW. The 3GPP AAA Server shall
make the decision based on the UE Identity and the trust relationship
information marked during the authentication and authorization procedure over
STa, SWa or SWm. If the 3GPP AAA server is unable to determine the trust
relationship of the access network, it shall not include the AN-Trusted AVP in
the answer message to the PDN GW.
For Fixed Broadband access network interworking as specified in 3GPP TS 23.139
[39],
  * For trusted access, the 3GPP AAA server shall determine if the UE is connected via a BBF-defined WLAN access according to the UE local IP address in UE-Local-IP-Address AVP from the PDN GW. If the UE is connected via a BBF-defined WLAN access, the 3GPP AAA server shall perform the enabling UE reflective QoS function as specified in 3GPP TS 24.139 [43].
  * For untrusted access, the UE local IP address is assigned by the ePDG and not by the non-3GPP access network. Hence, in this case the 3GPP AAA Server shall ignore the UE local IP address in UE-Local-IP-Address AVP from the PDN GW.
##### 9.1.2.1.4 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy is required to handle roaming cases in which the PDN GW is
in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a stateful proxy.
On receipt of the authentication answer that completes a successful
authentication, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall record the state of the connection
(i.e. Authentication Successful).
If receiving the UE Care of Address from the PDN GW which is in the VPLMN, the
3GPP AAA Proxy may select a different PDN GW which is closer to the UE than
the currently serving PDN GW as specified in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3] based on the
received UE Care of Address. In this case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall respond to
the PDN GW with the Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS_RELOCATE_HA and
include the selected PDN GW identity in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP.
#### 9.1.2.2 Authorization Procedures when using PMIPv6 or GTPv2
##### 9.1.2.2.1 General
The following authorization procedures take place upon a reception of a PBU at
the PDN GW from the MAG or upon a reception of a Create Session Request at the
PDN GW from the trusted non-3GPP access network or from the ePDG.
The PDN GW shall update its address information to the 3GPP AAA Server and
HSS. Static QoS profile information may also be downloaded at the same time.If
the PDN GW reports to the 3GPP AAA server that GTPv2 is used over the S2a or
S2b interface, the 3GPP AAA Server may decide not to download parameters to
the PDN GW on the S6b interface which are already provided to the PGW via the
trusted non-3GPP access network through the STa and GTPv2 based S2a interfaces
or via the ePDG through the SWm and the GTPv2 based S2b interfaces (e.g,
static QoS profile, Trace Information, APN-AMBR).
The procedures are based on the reuse of NASREQ IETF RFC 4005 [4] AAR and AAA
commands and the Diameter extensions defined for PMIP in IETF RFC 5779 [2].

##### 9.1.2.2.2 PDN GW Detailed Behaviour
Upon receipt of a PBU message from the MAG or upon receipt of a Create Session
Request from the trusted non-3GPP access network or the ePDG which requires
the establishment of a new PDN connection via the non-3GPP access, the PDN GW
shall initiate an authorization procedure, by sending an Authorization Request
message to the 3GPP AAA server or to the 3GPP AAA Proxy, with the Auth-
Request-Type set to AUTHORIZE_ONLY, in order to update the PGW Address for the
APN and the selected S2a or S2b protocol variant, as well as to optionally
download any UE specific APN profile information such as IP address allocation
information, QoS Information, Session timeouts, Session Idle timeouts etc.
The PDN GW shall include in the request the APN where the user shall be
connected to.
The PDN GW Identity and PLMN shall only be included in the initial request to
the 3GPP AAA server; subsequent authorization messages (due to a handover to a
different MAG, for instance) shall not include it again.
After successful reception of the Authorization Request message, the PDN GW
shall check that the Result-Code is set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS and, if so, it
shall proceed to connect the user to the specified APN.
For PMIPv6 based S2a or S2b, if Trace-Info AVP including Trace-Data has been
received in the authorization response, the PDN GW shall start a trace session
for the user. If Trace-Info including Trace-Reference (directly under the
Trace-Info) has been received in the authorization response, the PDN GW shall
stop the ongoing trace session, identified by the Trace-Reference. For
details, see 3GPP TS 32.422 [32].
For GTPv2 based S2a or S2b, the PDN GW shall ignore the Trace-Info AVP if
received in the authorization response.
NOTE: For GTPv2 based S2a or S2b, trace is activated and deactivated via the
STa and S2a interfaces or via the SWm and S2b interfaces.
##### 9.1.2.2.3 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
Upon receipt of the Authorization Request message from the PDN GW, the 3GPP
AAA Server shall update the PDN GW information for the APN for the UE on the
HSS.
The 3GPP AAA Server must check whether the user\'s profile is available.
If the user\'s data exist in the 3GPP AAA Server, it shall check, whether it
also has an active access authorization session for the user.
  * If not, the 3GPP AAA Server shall reject the authorization request, including the Result-Code DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED.
  * If the 3GPP AAA Server has an existing authorization session,
\- If the APN requested by the PDN GW is included in the list of authorized
APNs of the user, then the3GPP AAA Server shall include the Service-Selection
AVP in the authorization answer and set the Result-Code to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
\- If the APN requested by the PDN GW is not included in the list of
authorized APNs, then the status code DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED shall be
returned to the PDN GW to indicate an unsuccessful authorization.
If the user\'s profile does not exist in the 3GPP AAA Server, it shall
retrieve the Diameter identity of the 3GPP AAA Server currently serving the
user from the HSS following the procedures for subscriber profile download as
specified in section 8.1.2.2.2. Depending on the HSS response,
\- If the HSS indicates that the user is currently being served by a different
3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server shall respond to the PDG-GW with the
Result-Code set to DIAMETER_REDIRECT_INDICATION and Redirect-Host set to the
Diameter URI of the 3GPP AAA Server currently serving the user (this Diameter
URI shall be constructed based on the Diameter Identity included in the 3GPP-
AAA-Server-Name AVP returned in the SWx authentication response from the HSS).
\- If the HSS returns DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN, the 3GPP AAA Server shall
return the same error to the PDN GW.
\- If the HSS sends the user\'s profile to the 3GPP AAA Server, the
authorization shall be rejected by setting the Result-Code to
DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED. The 3GPP AAA Server shall delete the
downloaded user profile.
NOTE: The last outcome corresponds to the case that the user has no active
access authorization procedure. This is considered as an error situation, e.g.
the Trusted Non-3GPP access network may have sent PBU without authorizing the
user.
##### 9.1.2.2.4 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy is required to handle roaming cases in which the PDN GW is
located in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a stateful proxy.
On receipt of the authorization answer, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
\- shall check locally configured information for the maximum allowed static
QoS parameters valid for visitors from the given HPLMN and modify the QoS
parameters received from the 3GPP AAA Server, to enforce the policy
limitations.
\- shall record the state of the connection (i.e. Authorization Successful).
#### 9.1.2.3 PDN GW Initiated Session Termination Procedures
##### 9.1.2.3.1 General
The S6b reference point allows the PDN GW to inform the 3GPP AAA server that
the UE disconnected a PDN connection associated to an APN, or that the PDN
connection was handed over to the 3GPP access, and therefore the mobility
session established for this PDN connection is to be removed.
The procedure shall be initiated by the PDN GW. These procedures are based on
the reuse of Diameter Base IETF RFC 3588 [7] STR and STA commands.
Each PDN connection shall be identified by the Diameter Session-Id parameter.

##### 9.1.2.3.2 PDN GW Detailed Behaviour
The PDN GW shall make use of this procedure when the PDN Connection associated
to the diameter session is, either disconnected, or handed over to the 3GPP
access.
Upon receipt of the Session Termination Answer message from the 3GPP AAA
Server or from the 3GPP AAA Proxy, the PDN GW shall check the Result Code AVP,
and in case of a DIAMETER_SUCCESS code, it shall release the context
associated to the active session identified by the Session-Id parameter used
in the initial authorization exchange.
##### 9.1.2.3.3 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
Upon receipt of the Session Termination Request message from the PDN GW or
from the 3GPP AAA Proxy, the 3GPP AAA Server shall check that there is an
ongoing session associated to any of the parameters received in the message
(Session-Id and User Name).
If an active session is found, the 3GPP AAA Server shall release the session
context associated to the specified session, and a Session Termination Answer
message shall be sent to the PDN GW or 3GPP AAA Proxy, indicating
DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
If the Session-Id included in the request does not correspond with any active
session, or if an active session is found but it does not belong to the user
identified by the User Name parameter, then a Session Termination Answer
message shall be sent to the PDN GW or 3GPP AAA Proxy, indicating
DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.
##### 9.1.2.3.4 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy is required to handle roaming cases in which the PDN GW is
located in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a stateful proxy.
On receipt of the Session Termination Request message from the PDN GW, the
3GPP AAA Proxy shall route the message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
On receipt of the Session Termination Answer message from the 3GPP AAA Server,
the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall route the message to the PDN GW, and it shall release
any local resources associated to the specified sessions only if the result
code is set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
#### 9.1.2.4 3GPP AAA Initiated Session Termination Procedures
##### 9.1.2.4.1 General
The S6b reference point allows the 3GPP AAA server to order a PDN GW to remove
a PDN connection previously activated by the UE.
This procedure shall be initiated by the 3GPP AAA server. This indicates to
the PDN GW to remove the corresponding PDN connection (identified by Session-
ID AVP and User-Name AVP). This procedure is based on the reuse of NASREQ IETF
RFC 4005 [4] ASR, ASA, STR and STA commands.
The 3GPP AAA Server shall include the Auth-Session-State AVP in the ASR
command with a value of NO_STATE_MAINTAINED if it does not require a STR from
the PDN GW. If it does require a STR from the PDN GW, the 3GPP AAA Server
shall either omit the Auth-Session-State AVP from the ASR command or include
the Auth-Session-State AVP in the ASR command with a value of
STATE_MAINTAINED.

##### 9.1.2.4.2 PDN GW Detailed Behaviour
Upon receipt of the Abort Session Request message from the 3GPP AAA Server or
from the 3GPP AAA Proxy, the PDN GW shall check that there is an ongoing
session with the received session-ID.
If an active session is found:
\- In the PMIPv6 or GTPv2 or MIPv4 cases, the PDN GW shall release any
resources associated with the identified diameter session, but it shall not
terminate any associated PDN connection.
\- In the DSMIPv6 case, the PDN GW shall initiate a termination procedure for
the associated PDN connection, and shall release any resources associated with
the identified diameter session.
If the termination procedure is successful for the identified session, an
Abort Session Answer message shall be sent to the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA
Proxy, indicating DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
If the Session-Id included in the request does not correspond with any active
session, or if an active session is found but it does not belong to the user
identified by the User Name parameter, then an Abort Session Answer message
shall be sent to the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy, indicating
DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.
If the termination procedure for the identified session cannot be completed
successfully, an Abort Session Answer message shall be sent to the 3GPP AAA
Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy, indicating DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
If the termination procedure was successful for the identified session and the
STR is required by the 3GPP AAA Server, the PDN GW shall send an STR to the
3GPP AAA Server with the Termination-Cause set to DIAMETER_ADMINISTRATIVE.
##### 9.1.2.4.3 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Server shall intiate a separate procedure for each active PDN
connection of the user, even if the user has several PDN connections via the
same PDN GW.
Upon receipt of the Abort Session Answer message from the PDN GW or from the
3GPP AAA Proxy, the 3GPP AAA Server shall check the Result Code AVP, and in
case of a DIAMETER_SUCCESS code, it shall release the context associated to
the active session identified by the Session-Id parameter.
If the error code DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY is received in the Result Code
AVP, the 3GPP AAA Server shall not release the context for the identified
session.
If the error code DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID is received in the Result Code
AVP, the 3GPP AAA Server shall release the context for the identified session.
On receipt of the STR from PDN GW, the 3GPP AAA Server shall return an STA
command with the Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
##### 9.1.2.4.4 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy is required to handle roaming cases in which the PDN GW is
located in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a stateful proxy.
On receipt of the Abort Session Request message from the 3GPP AAA Server, the
3GPP AAA Proxy shall route the message to the PDN GW.
If the 3GPP AAA Proxy requires an STR but the 3GPP AAA Server does not, the
3GPP AAA Proxy may override the value of the Auth-Session-State in the ASR and
set it to STATE_MAINTAINED. In this case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy shall not forward
the STR received from the PDN GW onto the 3GPP AAA Server and shall return an
STA command to the PDN GW with the Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. The
3GPP AAA Proxy shall not override the value of the Auth-Session-State AVP
under any other circumstances.
On receipt of the Abort Session Answer message from the PDN GW, the 3GPP AAA
Proxy shall route the message to the 3GPP AAA Server, and it shall release any
local resources associated to the specified session only if the result code is
set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
When the 3GPP AAA Proxy receives the STR from PDN GW, it shall route the
request to the 3GPP AAA Server. On receipt of the STA message, the 3GPP AAA
Proxy shall route the response to the PDN GW.
#### 9.1.2.5 Service Authorization Information Update Procedures
##### 9.1.2.5.1 General
The S6b reference point allows the 3GPP AAA server to modify the authorization
information previously provided to the PDN GW, i.e. during Service
Authentication and Authorization when using DSMIPv6, or Service Authorization
using PMIPv6 or GTPv2 or MIPv4, or the service authorization information
provided during a previous Service Authorization update. This procedure is
triggered by the modification of the non-3GPP profile of the UE or by
activating or deactivating subscriber and equipment trace in the HSS. This
procedure is also triggered by the authentication and authorization via STa or
SWm, when the 3GPP AAA Server detects that an S6b session already exists for
the UE, as specified in section 5.1.2.1.2 and 7.1.2.1.2. In this case, the
3GPP AAA Server shall use this procedure to send the trust relationship to the
PDN GW.
The Service Authorization Information Update procedure is performed in two
steps:
1\. The 3GPP AAA server issues an unsolicited re-authentication and/or re-
authorization request towards the PDN GW. Upon receipt of this request, the
PDN GW responds to the request and indicates the disposition of the request.
This procedure is based on the reuse of Diameter Base IETF RFC 3588 [7] RAR
and RAA commands. The information element content for these messages is shown
in tables 9.1.2.5.1/1 and 9.1.2.5.1/2.
2\. After receiving the re-authorization request, the PDN GW invokes the
authorization procedure for the APN identified by the session ID included in
the former re-authorization request message. The authorization procedure for
PMIPv6 or GTPv2 is described in the section 9.1.2.2. Tables 9.1.2.5.1/3 and
9.1.2.5.1/4 describe the message contents in case of DSMIPv6.

##### 9.1.2.5.2 Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA server shall make use of this procedure in two steps to indicate
and update relevant service authorization information in the PDN GW.
The 3GPP AAA server shall send a re-authorization request for all
authorization sessions that are active for the user.
Each PDN GW, upon reception of an unsolicited re-authentication and/or re-
authorization request shall perform the following check and if there is an
error detected, the PDN GW shall stop processing and return the corresponding
error code.
Check the Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP:
1\. If it indicates AUTHENTICATE_ONLY, Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_INVALID_AVP_VALUE.
2\. If it indicates AUTHORIZE_ONLY, then, depending on the used IP mobility
protocol
\- In case of PMIPv6 or GTPv2, the PDN GW shall perform an authorization
procedure as described in section 9.1.2.2.
\- In case of DSMIPv6, the PDN GW shall perform an authorization procedure,
sending an authorization request described in Tables 9.1.5.1/3 and 9.1.5.1/4.
If the Trust-Relationship-Update flag is set in the RAR Flags present in the
request, the PDN GW may send an authorization request with only mandatory
AVPs.
3\. If it indicates AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE, Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER_INVALID_AVP_VALUE.
When receiving the authorization request, if the authorization procedure is
triggered by the 3GPP AAA Server to send the trust relationship to the PDN GW,
the 3GPP AAA Server shall send the trust relationship of the access network
for the subscriber to the PDN GW with Result-Code DIAMETER_SUCCESS. Otherwise,
the 3GPP AAA Server shall check, whether
\- the subscriber still has non-3GPP subscription to access EPC network
\- the non-3GPP APNs are enabled for the user, and
\- the updated user profile contains the APN, for which the given
authorization session was created.
If any of the checked conditions are not met, the 3GPP AAA Server shall set
the Result-Code to DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED. Otherwise, it shall
respond with Result-Code DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
After successful service authorization information update procedure , the PDN
GW shall overwrite the stored user and APN data, for the subscriber identity
indicated in the request, with the information received from the 3GPP AAA
server. A session termination shall be initiated if the subscriber is no
longer authorized to use the activated APN. If only trust relationship of the
access network is received, the PDN GW shall keep all stored user and APN data
for the subscriber identity as indicated in the request.
For PMIPv6 based S2a or S2b, if Trace-Info AVP including Trace-Data has been
received in the authorization response, the PDN GW shall start a trace session
for the user. If Trace-Info including Trace-Reference (directly under the
Trace-Info) has been received in the authorization response, the PDN GW shall
stop the ongoing trace session, identified by the Trace-Reference. For
details, see 3GPP TS 32.422 [32].
For GTPv2 based S2a or S2b, the PDN GW shall ignore the Trace-Info AVP if
received in the authorization response.
NOTE: For GTPv2 based S2a or S2b, trace is activated and deactivated via the
STa and S2a interfaces or via the SWm and S2b interfaces.
#### 9.1.2.6 Authorization Procedures when using MIPv4 FACoA
##### 9.1.2.6.1 General
The following authorization procedures take place upon a reception of a RRQ at
the PDN GW from the FA.
The PDN GW shall update its address information to the 3GPP AAA Server and
HSS. Static QoS profile information may also be downloaded at the same time.
MIPv4 security parameters shall be exchanged between the PDN GW and the 3GPP
AAA Server.
The procedures are based on the reuse of NASREQ IETF RFC 4005 [4] AAR and AAA
commands.

##### 9.1.2.6.2 PDN GW Detailed Behaviour
Upon receipt of a RRQ message from the FA, the PDN GW shall initiate an
authorization procedure, by sending an Authorization Request message to the
3GPP AAA Server or to the 3GPP AAA Proxy, with the Auth-Request-Type set to
AUTHORIZE_ONLY, in order to update the PGW Address for the APN, as well as to
download any UE specific APN profile information such as IP address allocation
information, QoS Information, Session timeouts, Session Idle timeouts, MIPv4
security parameters etc.
If the APN was included in the RRQ message, the PDN GW shall include in the
request the APN where the user shall be connected.
The PDN GW Identity shall only be included in the initial request to the 3GPP
AAA Server; subsequent authorization messages (due to a handover to a
different FA, for instance) shall not include it again.
If the PDN GW does not have a MN-HA shared key associated with the SPI
received in the RRQ MN-HA-AE, the PDN GW shall include the SPI in the
Authorization Request to the 3GPP AAA Server.
After successful reception of the Authorization Request message, the PDN GW
shall check that the Result-Code is set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS and, if so, it
shall use the MN-HA key to verify the MN-HA AE of the RRQ received from the
FA.
If the PDN-GW successfully verifies the MN-HA-AE it shall proceed to connect
the user to the specified APN, and will send the RRP message to the FA.
##### 9.1.2.6.3 3GPP AAA Server Detailed Behaviour
Upon receipt of the Authorization Request message from the PDN GW, the 3GPP
AAA Server shall update the PDN GW information for the APN for the UE on the
HSS. If the APN was not received from the PDN GW the 3GPP AAA Server shall
assign the received PDN-GW identity to the default APN .
The 3GPP AAA Server must check that the user exists. If the user\'s data
exists in the 3GPP AAA Server, it shall check, whether it also has an active
access authorization session for the user.
  * If not, the 3GPP AAA Server shall reject the authorization request, including the Result-Code DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED.
  * If the 3GPP AAA Server has an existing authorization session,
\- If the APN requested by the PDN GW is included in the list of authorized
APNs of the user, then the 3GPP AAA Server shall include the Service-Selection
AVP in the authorization answer. If no APN was requested the Service-Selection
AVP shall contain the default APN.
\- If the MN-HA-SPI was included in the request and it matches the SPI
belonging to a SA of the user then the 3GPP AAA Server shall include the MIP-
Session-Key of the SA in the authorization answer and set the Result-Code to
DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
\- If the MN-HA-SPI was included in the request and there is no match with a
SPI belonging to a SA of the user then the status code
DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED shall be returned to the PDN GW to indicate an
unsuccessful authorization.
\- If the APN requested by the PDN GW is not included in the list of
authorized APNs, then the status code DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED shall be
returned to the PDN GW to indicate an unsuccessful authorization.
If the user\'s profile does not exist in the 3GPP AAA Server, it shall
retrieve the Diameter identity of the 3GPP AAA Server currently serving the
user from the HSS following the procedures for subscriber profile download as
specified in section 8.1.2.2.2. Depending on the HSS response,
\- If the HSS indicates that the user is currently being served by a different
3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server shall respond to the PDG-GW with the
Result-Code set to DIAMETER_REDIRECT_INDICATION and Redirect-Host set to the
Diameter URI of the 3GPP AAA Server currently serving the user (this Diameter
URI shall be constructed based on the Diameter Identity included in the 3GPP-
AAA-Server-Name AVP returned in the SWx authentication response from the HSS).
\- If the HSS returns DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN, the 3GPP AAA Server shall
return the same error to the PDN GW.
\- If the HSS sends the user\'s profile to the 3GPP AAA Server, the
authorization shall be rejected by setting the Result-Code to
DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED. The 3GPP AAA Server shall delete the
downloaded user profile.
NOTE: The last outcome corresponds to the case that the user has no active
access authorization procedure. This is considered as an error situation, e.g.
the Trusted Non-3GPP access network may have sent RRQ without authorizing the
user.
##### 9.1.2.6.4 3GPP AAA Proxy Detailed Behaviour
The 3GPP AAA Proxy is required to handle roaming cases in which the PDN GW is
located in the VPLMN. The 3GPP AAA Proxy shall act as a stateful proxy.
On receipt of the authorization answer, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
\- shall check locally configured information for the maximum allowed static
QoS parameters valid for visitors from the given HPLMN and modify the QoS
parameters received from the 3GPP AAA Server, to enforce the policy
limitations.
\- shall record the state of the connection (i.e. Authorization Successful).
## 9.2 Protocol Specification
### 9.2.1 General
The S6b reference point shall be based on Diameter, as defined in IETF RFC
3588 [7] and contain the following additions and extensions:
\- IETF RFC 4005 [4], which defines a Diameter protocol application used for
Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) services in the Network
Access Server (NAS) environment.
\- IETF RFC 5779 [2], which defines a Diameter extensions and application for
PMIPv6 MAG to AAA and LMA to AAA interfaces.
\- IETF RFC 5777 [9], which defines attribute value pairs to convey QoS
information between Diameter peers.
The PDN GW to 3GPP AAA server or the PDN GW to 3GPP AAA proxy communication
shall use the LMA to AAA interface functionality defined in IETF RFC 5779 [2]
to update the 3GPP AAA server with PDN GW identity, indicate the protocol
selected on S2a or S2b and optionally retrieve mobility related parameters and
static QoS profiles, when PMIPv6 or GTPv2 based S2a or S2b is used.
The PDN-GW acts as a LMA when the UE attaches to the EPC using the S2a or S2b
reference points and PMIPv6 is used. The PDN GW also follows the LMA to AAA
interface functionality defined in IETF RFC 5779 [2] when UE attaches to the
EPC using S2a or S2b reference point and GTPv2 is used. The PDN GW acts as HA
when the UE attaches to the EPC using the S2a reference point and MIPv4 is
used.
In the case the UE attached to the EPC using the S2c reference point, then the
communication between the PDN GW and HA, IETF RFC 5778 [11] shall be used. The
Application Id to be advertised over the S6b reference point corresponds to
the DSMIPv6 \"Diameter Mobile IPv6 IKE (MIP6I)\" Application Id as defined in
IETF RFC 5778 [11].
IKEv2 EAP-based initiator authentication is used for authenticating and
authorizing the UE and updating the PDN-GW identity. In this case, the PDN GW
or HA shall act as the NAS, as described in 3GPP TS 33.234 [10].

PDN Connection is either disconnected on the non-3GPP access, or handed over
to the 3GPP access, the diameter session shall be terminated. In order to
indicate that the session state is to be maintained, the Diameter client and
server shall not include the Auth-Session-State AVP, either in the request or
in the response messages (see IETF RFC 3588 [7]).
# 10 Result-Code and Experimental-Result Values
## 10.1 General
This section defines result code values that shall be supported by all
Diameter implementations that conform to this specification.
## 10.2 Success
Result codes that fall within the Success category shall be used to inform a
peer that a request has been successfully completed. The Result-Code AVP
values defined in Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 [7] shall be applied.
## 10.3 Permanent Failures
### 10.3.1 General
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request has failed, and should not be attempted
again. The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588
[7] shall be applied. When one of the result codes defined here is included in
a response, it shall be inside an Experimental-Result AVP and the Result-Code
AVP shall be absent.
### 10.3.2 DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN (5001)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that the user identified
by the IMSI is unknown (see 3GPP TS 29.299 [9]).
### 10.3.3 DIAMETER_ERROR_IDENTITY_NOT_REGISTERED (5003)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that there is currently
no 3GPP AAA Server registered for the user (see 3GPP TS 29.299 [9]).
### 10.3.4 DIAMETER_ERROR_ROAMING_NOT_ALLOWED (5004)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that the subscriber is
not allowed to roam in a certain non-3GPP V-PLMN (see 3GPP TS 29.299 [9]).
### 10.3.5 DIAMETER_ERROR_IDENTITY_ALREADY_REGISTERED (5005)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that the node identity
trying to be registered by a 3GPP AAA Server is already registered for a
specific user (see 3GPP TS 29.299 [9]).
### 10.3.6 DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_NO_NON_3GPP_SUBSCRIPTION (5450)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that no non-3GPP
subscription is associated with the IMSI.
### 10.3.7 DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_NO_APN_SUBSCRIPTION (5451)
This result code shall be sent by the 3GPP AAA Server to indicate that the
requested APN is not included in the user\'s profile, and therefore is not
authorized for that user.
### 10.3.8 DIAMETER_ERROR_RAT_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED (5452)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate the RAT type the UE is
using is not allowed for the IMSI.
## 10.4 Transient Failures
### 10.4.1 General
Result codes that fall within the transient failures category shall be used to
inform a peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was
received, but may be able to satisfy the request in the future. The Result-
Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 [7] shall be
applied. When one of the result codes defined here is included in a response,
it shall be inside an Experimental-Result AVP and the Result-Code AVP shall be
absent.
There are no Transient Error codes defined in this specification.
